See also Wikipedia:Manual of Style (abbreviations), Wikipedia:WikiProject Glossaries, and List of acronyms.div;__NOTOC__; nowiki;: The English-, German-, Spanish-, French-, Japanese-, etc.-language Wikipedia.

This usage comes from the relational operator in such languages as C.;!vote :Read as not-vote (the exclamation mark means 'not' in many programming languages).

See also Wikipedia:Polling is not a substitute for discussion.;+:Used to show minor addition to text. Used in edit summaries.;?:Used to show correction of odd minor error. Used in edit summaries.;0RR: Voluntary or imposed zero-revert rule. See Wikipedia:Revert only when necessary#Zero-revert rule.;1RR: Voluntary or imposed (sometimes by ArbCom) one-revert rule.

When a user gets the admin bit they have just become an administrator. Also known as a flag or the admin flag. See Wikipedia:User access levels for further information.;BJAODN: Abbreviation for Wikipedia:Bad jokes and other deleted nonsense, a now-inactive page. The verb, BJAODNed, refers to the act of something being posted on the page with that name, and was often used at Wikipedia namespace articles involving heavy user participation, such as the Reference desk or AfD/TfD pages.;Blanking: Removing all content from a page. Newcomers often do this accidentally. On the other hand, if blanking an article is done in bad faith, it is vandalism. Newcomers often mistake blanking for deletion. If someone wants their new article removed, they should simply add or to it and an administrator will delete the page.;Block, WP:BLOCK: Action by an administrator, removing from a certain IP address or username the ability to edit Wikipedia. Usually done against addresses that have engaged in vandalism or against users who have been banned – see Wikipedia:Blocking policy.

The word is commonly used as a sarcastic hint to lighten up when discussions seem to become a little too paranoid. Discussions involving the term may have links to POV / NPOV issues, admin problems, or pretty much anything to do with the foundation of Wikipedia. The term TINC (There Is No Cabal) is occasionally encountered, used humorously in such a way as to suggest that maybe there is a cabal after all. The term is comparable to the use of the term SMOF in science fiction fandom. See also m:Cabal, There Is No Cabal, Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal, WP:CABAL;CamelCase: CamelCase (camel case or camel-case)—originally known as medial capitals—is the practice of writing compound words or phrases in which the elements are joined without spaces, with each element's initial letter capitalized within the compound and the first letter is either upper or lower case—as in LaBelle, BackColor, or McDonald's. See also Wikipedia:CamelCase and Wikipedia.;Canvassing, WP:CANVAS: Canvassing is sending or posting messages to multiple Wikipedians with the intent to inform them about a community discussion. Under certain conditions, canvassing is acceptable to notify other editors of ongoing discussions (see Friendly messages).

See Wikipedia:Canvassing.;Cat, cat.:Category or categorize. Often pluralized as cats or cats.;Category: A category is a collection of pages automatically formed by the Wikipedia servers by analyzing category tags in articles. Category tags look like this: :Category:Computers. The part after the : is the name of the Category.

A list of basic categories to browse through can be found at :Category:Fundamental categories, though a more user-friendly way to find a category is at Wikipedia:Browse.;Category declaration, category tag:A category name placed at the bottom of any page and the wiki-syntax of doing this. Pages are placed into categories by the use of the category declarations. Some people refer to category declarations as category tags. A category declaration looks like nowiki; where foo bar is name of the category and serves as the title of the category page.;CC-BY-SA: Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike.

A redirect which wikilinks back to itself, either directly or via a chain of redirects. A special case of circular reference.;Civil:Civility; CLS: Cats, lists, boxes;Cleanup, cl: The process of repairing articles that contain errors of grammar, are poorly formatted, or contain irrelevant material.

An example would be .;Contribs, contributions: Edits in wikipedia, supposed to be useful, unlike vandalism.

See also XNR, CNR, Wikipedia:Namespace and Wikipedia:Cross-namespace redirects (essay).;Cruft: A somewhat dismissive term used to describe an article or group of articles that are too focused on a specific topic, covering it in too much detail for a general encyclopedia. The term is often used as a suffix for terms such as Pokécruft (Pokémon-cruft) and Roadcruft (cruft articles about roads). Cruft articles are often on topics such as minor characters from television series, or very specific lists of songs (such as List of songs which includes the word 'death' in the lyrics). Cruft is often deleted or merged into other articles by the Wikipedia community.;CSB: WikiProject Countering systemic bias or, more rarely, an adjective for a topic of concern to the WikiProject, e.g., This does not seem to be a CSB article. Systemic bias is the tendency for Wikipedia articles to be biased towards a European or American view of things, simply because most editors are European or American.;CSD, WP:CSD: Criteria for speedy deletion, a policy detailing the circumstances when articles etc. can be removed from Wikipedia without discussion.

See also un-bold.;Deleted edit:An edit that is no longer listed in an editor's contributions because the page has subsequently been deleted.;Deletionist: Someone who actively attempts to delete pages that others prefer to keep.

Often cited on Requests for Adminship regarding people who judge people on sheer edit count rather than personal merit.;Edit creep, editcreep, edit-creep: The tendency for high quality articles to degrade over time. Articles usually achieve good article or featured article recognition because a small core of people knew the subject well and researched it carefully.

(By way of analogy to scope creep.);Edit link:See Broken link.;Edit summary: The contents of the Summary: field below the edit box on the Edit this page page.;Editor: Anyone who writes or modifies articles in a Wikipedia.

The process begins with a discussion on the article's talk page. If the issues are not resolved, a user may list the article on FAR, where a discussion takes place to help identify and address areas where improvement may be needed. After the discussion, if no consensus emerges to keep the article featured, the review moves on to the next stage, featured article removal candidates (FARC).

A forest fire becomes progressively more difficult for any user to keep track of. On Wikipedia, this is less of a problem than on other wikis, due to well-established boundaries for user conduct, clear guidelines for article content, and a formal dispute resolution process. See also wildfire and MeatBall:ForestFire.;Fork: A splitting of an entity to satisfy different groups of people – in Wikipedia, this can either mean a project-wide split, in which a group of users decides to take a project database and continue with it on their own site (which is perfectly legal under the GFDL, and one of an editor's least disputed rights), or the split of an article, usually to accommodate different POVs. The latter is often called a POV fork and generally regarded as highly undesirable.;fmt: Format.

See Wikipedia:Canvassing.;GA:Good article.;Gadget: A gadget is a JavaScript tool that can be enabled from your Wikipedia preferences.;Gdanzig:An edit war over which of several possible names should be used for a place.

Paraphrased, the law states that there exists a strong correlation between the lack of proper capitalization of a person's name in the title of a biographical article, and the failure of the subject of that article to satisfy the criteria for inclusion of biographies.;GF: Good faith, a tenet of Wikipedia.;GFDL: GNU Free Documentation License.

It is often cited as soon as it occurs as a flag that discussions have gone on too long or gotten out of hand on a particular topic.;Google test: Running sections or titles of articles through the Google search engine for various purposes. The four most common are to check for copyright violations, to determine which term among several is the most widely used, to decide whether a person is sufficiently notable to warrant an article and to check whether a questionable and obscure topic is real (as opposed to the idiosyncratic invention of a particular individual). See also Ghits, Wikipedia:Google test.;GPL: GNU General Public License. Wikipedia's software is released under this license.;gr:Grammar, used in edit summaries to indicate that a grammar problem is being corrected;Hagiography: Wording that is excessively fulsome, adulatory or glowing in a biographical article, to the point of violating NPOV.;Handwaving, armwaving: An assertion not supported by evidence; most frequently seen in articles for deletion discussions, when editors may assert that a subject is notable, but fail to make a convincing case.
