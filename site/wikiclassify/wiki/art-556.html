				<span class='text'>Leopold became the orchestra's deputy [[Kapellmeister]] in 1763</span>
				<span class='text'>During the year of his son's birth, Leopold published a violin textbook, ''[[Versuch einer gründlichen Violinschule]]'', which achieved success</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Solomon (1995, 32)&lt;/ref&gt;When Nannerl was seven, she began keyboard lessons with her father while her three-year-old brother looked on</span>
				<span class='text'>Years later, after her brother's death, she reminisced:&lt;blockquote&gt;He often spent much time at the [[Keyboard instrument|clavier]], picking out thirds, which he was ever striking, and his pleasure showed that it sounded good</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> In the fourth year of his age his father, for a game as it were, began to teach him a few minuets and pieces at the clavier</span>

				<span class='text'>A particularly important influence was [[Johann Christian Bach]], whom Mozart visited in London in 1764 and 1765</span>
				<span class='text'>The family again went to Vienna in late 1767 and remained there until December 1768</span>
				<span class='text'>hese trips were often difficult and travel conditions were primitive</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Halliwell|1998|pp=51, 53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family had to wait for invitations and reimbursement from the nobility and they endured long, near-fatal illnesses far from home: first Leopold (London, summer 1764)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Halliwell|1998|pp=82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; then both children (The Hague, autumn 1765)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Halliwell|1998|pp=99–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;After one year in Salzburg, Leopold and Mozart set off for Italy, leaving Mozart's mother and sister at home</span>
				<span class='text'>This travel lasted from December 1769 to March 1771</span>
				<span class='text'>As with earlier journeys, Leopold wanted to display his son's abilities as a performer and a rapidly maturing composer</span>
				<span class='text'>Mozart met [[Josef Mysliveček]] and [[Giovanni Battista Martini]] in [[Bologna]] and was accepted as a member of the famous [[Accademia Filarmonica di Bologna|Accademia Filarmonica]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In Rome, he heard [[Gregorio Allegri]]'s ''[[Miserere (Allegri)|Miserere]]'' twice in performance in the [[Sistine Chapel]] and wrote it out from memory, thus producing the first unauthorized copy of this closely guarded property of the [[Holy See|Vatican]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In Milan, Mozart wrote the opera ''[[Mitridate, re di Ponto]]'' (1770), which was performed with success</span>
				<span class='text'>This led to further opera [[commission (art)|commissions]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He returned with his father later twice to Milan (August–December 1771; October 1772&amp;nbsp;– March 1773) for the composition and premieres of ''[[Ascanio in Alba]]'' (1771) and ''[[Lucio Silla]]'' (1772)</span>
				<span class='text'>Leopold hoped these visits would result in a professional appointment for his son in Italy, but these hopes were never realized</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Halliwell|1998|pp=172, 183–185}}&lt;/ref&gt;Toward the end of the final Italian journey, Mozart wrote the first of his works to be still widely performed today, the solo [[motet]] ''[[Exsultate, jubilate]]'', [[Köchel catalogue|K</span>

				<span class='text'>The composer had a great number of friends and admirers in Salzburg&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Solomon|1995|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had the opportunity to work in many genres, including symphonies, sonatas, string quartets, [[Mass (music)|masses]], serenades, and a few minor operas</span>
				<span class='text'>Between April and December 1775, Mozart developed an enthusiasm for violin concertos, producing a series of five (the only ones he ever wrote), which steadily increased in their musical sophistication</span>
				<span class='text'>The last three—[[Violin Concerto No</span>
				<span class='text'>3 (Mozart)|K</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;216]], [[Violin Concerto No</span>

				<span class='text'>5 (Mozart)|K</span>

				<span class='text'>9 (Mozart)|K</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;271]] of early 1777, considered by critics to be a breakthrough work</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Solomon|1995|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;Despite these artistic successes, Mozart grew increasingly discontented with Salzburg and redoubled his efforts to find a position elsewhere</span>
				<span class='text'>One reason was his low salary, 150 florins a year;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Solomon|1995|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mozart longed to compose operas, and Salzburg provided only rare occasions for these</span>
				<span class='text'>The situation worsened in 1775 when the court theater was closed, especially since the other theater in Salzburg was largely reserved for visiting troupes</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Solomon|1995|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;Two long expeditions in search of work interrupted this long Salzburg stay: Mozart and his father visited Vienna from 14 July to 26 September 1773, and Munich from 6 December 1774 to March 1775</span>
				<span class='text'>Neither visit was successful, though the Munich journey resulted in a popular success with the premiere of Mozart's opera ''[[La finta giardiniera]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sadie|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;Mozart became acquainted with members of the famous orchestra in Mannheim, the best in Europe at the time</span>

				<span class='text'>Solomon considers his three closest friends to have been Gottfried von Jacquin, Count August Hatzfeld, and Sigmund Barisani; others included his older colleague [[Joseph Haydn]], singers [[Franz Xaver Gerl]] and [[Benedikt Schack]], and the horn player [[Joseph Leutgeb]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Solomon|1995|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mozart also wrote scatological music, a series of [[Canon (music)|canons]] that he sang with his friends</span>

				<span class='text'>At the time he began composing, European music was dominated by the ''[[galant|style galant]]'', a reaction against the highly evolved intricacy of the [[Baroque music|Baroque]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Progressively, and in large part at the hands of Mozart himself, the [[counterpoint|contrapuntal]] complexities of the late Baroque emerged once more, moderated and disciplined by new [[Musical form|forms]], and adapted to a new aesthetic and social milieu</span>
				<span class='text'>Mozart was a versatile composer, and wrote in every major genre, including [[symphony]], opera, the solo concerto, chamber music including [[string quartet]] and [[string quintet]], and the piano [[sonata]]</span>
				<span class='text'>These forms were not new, but Mozart advanced their technical sophistication and emotional reach</span>
				<span class='text'>He almost single-handedly developed and popularized the Classical [[Mozart piano concertos|piano concerto]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote a great deal of [[religious music]], including large-scale [[mass (music)|masses]], as well as dances, [[divertimento|divertimenti]], [[serenade]]s, and other forms of light entertainment</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=December 2012}}The central traits of the Classical style are all present in Mozart's music</span>
				<span class='text'>Clarity, balance, and transparency are the hallmarks of his work, but simplistic notions of its delicacy mask the exceptional power of his finest masterpieces, such as the [[Piano Concerto No</span>
				<span class='text'>24 (Mozart)|Piano Concerto No</span>
				<span class='text'>24]] in C minor, K</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;491; the [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>40 (Mozart)|Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;40]] in G minor, K</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;550; and the opera ''[[Don Giovanni]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Charles Rosen]] makes the point forcefully:&lt;blockquote&gt;It is only through recognizing the violence and sensuality at the center of Mozart's work that we can make a start towards a comprehension of his structures and an insight into his magnificence</span>
				<span class='text'>In a paradoxical way, [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]]'s superficial characterization of the [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>40 (Mozart)|G minor Symphony]] can help us to see Mozart's daemon more steadily</span>
				<span class='text'>In all of Mozart's supreme expressions of suffering and terror, there is something shockingly voluptuous</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rosen|1998|p=324}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Especially during his last decade, Mozart exploited [[Chromaticism|chromatic]] harmony to a degree rare at the time, with remarkable assurance and to great artistic effect</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=December 2012}}Mozart always had a gift for absorbing and adapting valuable features of others' music</span>
				<span class='text'>His travels helped in the forging of a unique compositional language</span>

				<span class='text'>Discussion of the sources of style as well as his early imitative ability</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In London as a child, he met [[Johann Christian Bach|J</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;C</span>
				<span class='text'>Bach]] and heard his music</span>
				<span class='text'>In Paris, Mannheim, and Vienna he met with other compositional influences, as well as the avant-garde capabilities of the [[Mannheim school|Mannheim orchestra]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In Italy he encountered the [[Italian overture]] and [[opera buffa]], both of which deeply affected the evolution of his own practice</span>
				<span class='text'>In London and Italy, the galant style was in the ascendent: simple, light music with a mania for [[cadence (music)|cadencing]]; an emphasis on tonic, dominant, and subdominant to the exclusion of other harmonies; symmetrical phrases; and clearly articulated partitions in the overall form of movements</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heartz|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Mozart's early symphonies are [[Italian overture]]s, with three movements running into each other; many are [[homotonal]] (all three movements having the same key signature, with the slow middle movement being in the [[Relative key|relative minor]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Others mimic the works of J</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;C</span>
				<span class='text'>Bach, and others show the simple [[binary form|rounded binary forms]] turned out by Viennese composers</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Mozart Sheet Music</span>

				<span class='text'>It is located at the [[Mozarthaus Vienna|Mozarthaus]] in Vienna</span>
				<span class='text'>]As Mozart matured, he progressively incorporated more features adapted from the Baroque</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, the [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>29 (Mozart)|Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;29 in A major]] K</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;201 has a contrapuntal main theme in its first movement, and experimentation with irregular phrase lengths</span>
				<span class='text'>Some of his quartets from 1773 have fugal finales, probably influenced by Haydn, who had included three such finales in his recently published Opus&amp;nbsp;20 set</span>
				<span class='text'>The influence of the ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' (&quot;Storm and Stress&quot;) period in music, with its brief foreshadowing of the [[Romanticism|Romantic era]], is evident in the music of both composers at that time</span>
				<span class='text'>Mozart's [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>25 (Mozart)|Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;25 in G minor]] K</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;183 is another excellent example</span>
				<span class='text'>ozart would sometimes switch his focus between operas and instrumental music</span>
				<span class='text'>He produced operas in each of the prevailing styles: [[opera buffa]], such as ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'', ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', and ''[[Così fan tutte]]''; [[opera seria]], such as ''[[Idomeneo]]''; and [[Singspiel]], of which ''[[The Magic Flute|Die Zauberflöte]]'' is the most famous example by any composer</span>
				<span class='text'>In his later operas he employed subtle changes in instrumentation, orchestral texture, and [[Timbre|tone color]], for emotional depth and to mark dramatic shifts</span>
				<span class='text'>Here his advances in opera and instrumental composing interacted: his increasingly sophisticated use of the orchestra in the symphonies and concertos influenced his operatic orchestration, and his developing subtlety in using the orchestra to psychological effect in his operas was in turn reflected in his later non-operatic compositions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Einstein|1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;===Influence===Mozart's most famous pupil, whom the Mozarts took into their Vienna home for two years as a child, was probably [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel]], a transitional figure between Classical and Romantic eras</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Solomon|1995|p=574}}&lt;/ref&gt; More important is the influence Mozart had on composers of later generations</span>
				<span class='text'>Ever since the surge in his reputation after his death, studying his scores has been a standard part of the training of classical musicians</span>
				<span class='text'>[Ludwig van Beethoven]], Mozart's junior by fifteen years, was deeply influenced by his work, with which he was acquainted as a teenager</span>
				<span class='text'>He is thought to have performed Mozart's operas while playing in the court orchestra at [[Bonn]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raptus}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he traveled to Vienna in 1787 hoping to study with the older composer</span>
				<span class='text'>Some of [[List of compositions by Ludwig van Beethoven#Instrumental works: WoO 1–86|Beethoven's works]] have direct models in comparable works by Mozart, and he wrote [[cadenza]]s ([[WoO]]&amp;nbsp;58) to Mozart's D minor piano concerto [[Piano Concerto No</span>
				<span class='text'>20 (Mozart)|K</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;466]]</span>
				<span class='text'>For further details see [[Mozart and Beethoven]]</span>
				<span class='text'> number of composers have paid homage to Mozart by writing sets of [[Variation (music)|variations]] on his themes</span>
				<span class='text'>Beethoven wrote four such sets (Op</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;66, WoO&amp;nbsp;28, WoO&amp;nbsp;40, WoO&amp;nbsp;46)</span>
				<span class='text'>Others include [[Fernando Sor]]'s [[Introduction and Variations on a Theme by Mozart (Sor)|Introduction and Variations on a Theme by Mozart]] (1821), [[Mikhail Glinka]]'s Variations on a Theme from Mozart's Opera &quot;[[The Magic Flute|Die Zauberflöte]]&quot; (1822), [[Frédéric Chopin]]'s [[Variations on &quot;Là ci darem la mano&quot; (Chopin)|Variations on &quot;Là ci darem la mano&quot;]] from ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' (1827), and [[Max Reger]]'s [[Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Mozart]] (1914), based on the variation theme in the piano sonata [[Piano Sonata No</span>
