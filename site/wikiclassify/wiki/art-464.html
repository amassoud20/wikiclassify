				<span class='text'>Strangelove'' (1964)]]'''Stanley Kubrick''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|uː|b|r|ɪ|k}}; July 26, 1928&amp;nbsp;– March 7, 1999) was an American film director, screenwriter, producer, [[cinematographer]], [[film editing|editor]], and photographer</span>
				<span class='text'>Part of the [[New Hollywood]] film-making wave, Kubrick's films are considered by film historian [[Michel Ciment]] to be &quot;among the most important contributions to world cinema in the twentieth century&quot;, and he is frequently cited as one of the greatest and most influential directors of all time</span>
				<span class='text'>His films, which are typically adaptations of novels or short stories, cover a wide range of genres, and are noted for their [[realism (art movement)|realism]], dark humor, unique cinematography, extensive set designs, and evocative use of music</span>
				<span class='text'>ubrick grew up in [[the Bronx]] in New York City, and attended [[William Howard Taft High School (New York City)|William Howard Taft High School]] from 1941 to 1945</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he only received average grades, Kubrick displayed a keen interest in literature, photography, and film from a young age, and taught himself all aspects of film production and directing after graduating from high school</span>
				<span class='text'>After working as a photographer for ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' magazine in the late 1940s and early 1950s, he began making short films on a shoestring budget, and made his first major Hollywood film, ''[[The Killing (film)|The Killing]]'', for [[United Artists]] in 1956</span>
				<span class='text'>This was followed by two collaborations with [[Kirk Douglas]], the war picture ''[[Paths of Glory]]'' (1957) and the historical epic ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'' (1960)</span>
				<span class='text'>His reputation as a filmmaker in Hollywood grew, and he was approached by [[Marlon Brando]] to film what would become ''[[One-Eyed Jacks]]'' (1961), though Brando eventually decided to direct it himself</span>
				<span class='text'>Creative differences arising from his work with Douglas and the film studios, a dislike of Hollywood, and a growing concern about crime in America prompted Kubrick to move to the United Kingdom in 1961, where he spent most of the remainder of his life and career</span>
				<span class='text'>His home at [[Childwickbury Manor]] in [[Hertfordshire]], which he shared with his wife [[Christiane Kubrick|Christiane]], became his workplace, where he did his writing, research, editing, and management of production details</span>
				<span class='text'>This allowed him to have almost complete artistic control over his films, but with the rare advantage of having financial support from major Hollywood studios</span>
				<span class='text'>His first British productions were two films with [[Peter Sellers]], ''[[Lolita (1962 film)|Lolita]]'' (1962) and ''[[Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Strangelove]]'' (1964)</span>
				<span class='text'>ubrick is noted for his attention to detail and evocative use of music</span>
				<span class='text'>A demanding perfectionist, he assumed control over most aspects of the [[filmmaking]] process, from direction and writing to editing, and took painstaking care with researching his films and staging scenes, working in close coordination with his actors and other collaborators</span>
				<span class='text'>He often asked for several dozen retakes of the same scene in a movie, which resulted in many conflicts with his casts</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite the resulting notoriety among actors, many of Kubrick's films broke new ground in cinematography</span>
				<span class='text'>The scientific realism and innovative special effects of ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968) were without precedent in the history of cinema, and the film earned him his only personal Oscar, for Best [[Academy Award for Visual Effects|Visual Effects]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Steven Spielberg]] has referred to the film as his generation's &quot;big bang&quot;, and it often tops polls of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest films ever made]]</span>
				<span class='text'>For the 18th-century period film ''[[Barry Lyndon]]'' (1975), Kubrick obtained lenses developed by Zeiss for [[NASA]], to film scenes under natural candlelight</span>
				<span class='text'>With ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' (1980), he became one of the first directors to make use of a [[Steadicam]] for stabilized and fluid tracking shots</span>
				<span class='text'>While many of Kubrick's films were controversial and initially received mixed reviews upon release—particularly ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' (1971), which Kubrick pulled from circulation in the UK following a mass media frenzy—most of his films were nominated for [[Academy Award|Oscar]]s, [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]]s, or [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] Awards</span>
				<span class='text'>His last film, ''[[Eyes Wide Shut]]'', was completed shortly before his death in 1999</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=15}} Elias Kubrick followed in 1902</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=16}} At Stanley's birth, the Kubricks lived in an apartment at 2160 Clinton Avenue in the Bronx</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=6}} Although his parents had been married in a Jewish ceremony, Kubrick did not have a religious upbringing, and would later profess an [[Atheism|atheistic]] view of the universe</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Cocks|2004| pp=22–25, 30}}{{sfn|Smith|2010|p=68}} By the district standards of the West Bronx, the family was fairly wealthy, with his father earning a good income from working as a physician</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=19}}Soon after his sister's birth, Kubrick began schooling in Public School 3 in the Bronx, and moved to Public School 90 in June 1938</span>
				<span class='text'>Although his IQ was discovered to be above average, his attendance was poor, and he missed 56 days in his first term alone, as many as he attended</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=17}} He displayed an interest in literature from a young age, and began reading Greek and Roman myths and the fables of the [[Brothers Grimm|Grimm brothers]] which &quot;instilled in him a lifelong affinity with Europe&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=18}} He spent most Saturdays during the summer watching the [[New York Yankees]], and would later photograph two boys watching the game in an assignment for ''Look'' magazine to emulate his own childhood excitement with baseball</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=19}}  When Kubrick was 12, his father Jack taught him [[chess]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The game remained a lifelong interest of Kubrick's, appearing in many scenes of his films</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=105–6}} Kubrick himself, who later became a member of the [[United States Chess Federation]], explained that chess helped him develop &quot;patience and discipline&quot; in making decisions</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Walker|1972|p=11}} At the age of 13, Kubrick's father bought him a [[Graflex]] camera, triggering a fascination with [[Photography|still photography]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He became friends with a neighbor, Marvin Taub, who shared his passion for photography</span>
				<span class='text'>Taub had his own darkroom, where the young Kubrick and he would spend many hours perusing photographs and watching the chemicals &quot;magically make images on photographic paper&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=15}} The two indulged in numerous photographic projects for which they roamed the streets for interesting subjects to capture, and spent time in local cinemas studying films</span>
				<span class='text'>Freelance photographer [[Weegee]] (Arthur Fellig) had a considerable influence on Kubrick's development as a photographer; Kubrick would later hire Fellig as the special stills photographer for ''[[Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Strangelove]]'' (1964)</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=22}} As a teenager, Kubrick was also interested in [[jazz]], and briefly attempted a career as a drummer</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Newsweek|1972|p=31}} Introverted and shy, Kubrick had a low attendance record, and often skipped school to watch double-feature films</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=15}} He graduated in 1945, but his poor grades, combined with the demand for college admissions from soldiers returning from the Second World War, eliminated hope of higher education</span>
				<span class='text'>Later in life, Kubrick spoke disdainfully of his education and of contemporary American schooling as a whole, maintaining that schools were ineffective in stimulating critical thinking and student interest</span>
				<span class='text'>His father was disappointed in his son's failure to achieve excellence in school, of which he felt Stanley was fully capable</span>
				<span class='text'>Jack also encouraged Stanley to read from the former's library at home, while at the same time permitting Stanley to take up photography as a serious hobby</span>

				<span class='text'>In the mid-1940s, since he was not able to gain admission to day session classes at colleges, he briefly attended evening classes at the [[City College of New York]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=33}} Eventually, he sold a photographic series to ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' magazine, having taken a photo to Helen O'Brian, head of the photographic department, who purchased it without hesitation for £25 on the spot</span>

				<span class='text'>Warren Schloat, Jr</span>
				<span class='text'> another new photographer for the magazine at the time, recalled that he thought Kubrick lacked the personality to make it as a director in Hollywood, remarking, &quot;Stanley was a quiet fellow</span>
				<span class='text'>He didn't say much</span>
				<span class='text'>He was thin, skinny, and kind of poor—like we all were&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=38}} Kubrick quickly became known, however, for his story-telling in photographs</span>
				<span class='text'>His first, published on April 16, 1946, was entitled &quot;A Short Story from a Movie Balcony&quot; and staged a fracas between a man and a woman, during which the man is slapped in the face, caught genuinely by surprise</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=19}} In another assignment, 18 pictures were taken of various people waiting in a dental office</span>
				<span class='text'>It has been said retrospectively that this project demonstrated an early interest of Kubrick in capturing individuals and their feelings in mundane environments</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=36}} In 1948, he was sent to Portugal to document a travel piece, and covered  the [[Ringling Bros</span>
				<span class='text'>and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus]] in [[Sarasota, Florida]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=30}}{{efn|Coverage of the circus gave Kubrick grounds for developing his documentary skills and capturing athletic movements on camera, and the photos were published in a four-page spread for the May 25 issue, &quot;Meet the People&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The same issue also covered his journalism work documenting the work of opera star [[Risë Stevens]] with deaf children</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|LoBrutto|1999|pp=41–2}}}} Kubrick, a boxing enthusiast, eventually began photographing boxing matches for the magazine</span>
				<span class='text'>His earliest, &quot;Prizefighter&quot;, was published on January 18, 1949, and captured a boxing match and the events leading up to it, featuring [[Walter Cartier]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=59}}  On April 2, 1949, he published a photo essay, named &quot;Chicago-City of Extremes&quot; in ''Look'', which displayed his talent early on for creating atmosphere with imagery, including a photograph taken above a congested Chicago street at night</span>
				<span class='text'>The following year, on July 18, 1950, the magazine published his photo essay, &quot;Working Debutante - [[Betsy von Furstenberg]]&quot;, which featured a [[Pablo Picasso]] portrait of Angel F</span>
				<span class='text'>de Soto in the background</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Duncan|2003|pp=16–7}} Kubrick was also assigned to photograph numerous jazz musicians, from [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Errol Garner]], to [[George Lewis (clarinetist)|George Lewis]], [[Eddie Condon]], [[Phil Napoleon]], [[Oscar Celestin]], [[Alphonse Picou]], [[Muggsy Spanier]], [[Sharkey Bonano]], and others</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=52}}Kubrick married his high-school sweetheart Toba Metz on May 28, 1948</span>
				<span class='text'>They lived together in a small apartment at 36 West 16th Street, off [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|6th Avenue]] in [[Greenwich Village]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=31}} During this time, Kubrick began frequenting film screenings at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] and the cinemas of New York City</span>
				<span class='text'>He was inspired by the complex, fluid camerawork of the director [[Max Ophüls]], whose films influenced Kubrick's later visual style, and by the director [[Elia Kazan]], whom he described as America's &quot;best director&quot; at that time, with his ability of &quot;performing miracles&quot; with his actors</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Ciment|1980|p=36}} Friends began to notice that Kubrick had become obsessed with the art of filmmaking—one friend, David Vaughn, observed that Kubrick would scrutinize the film at the cinema when it went silent, and would go back to reading his paper when people started talking</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=19}} He also spent many hours reading books on film theory and writing down notes</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s theoretical writings had a profound impact on Kubrick, and he took a great number of notes from books in the library of [[Arthur Rothstein]], the photographic technical director of ''Look'' magazine</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=37}}{{efn| Kubrick was particularly fascinated with Eisenstein's ''[[Alexander Nevsky]]'' and played the [[Prokofiev]] soundtrack to the film over and over constantly to the point that his sister broke it in fury</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|250px|Kubrick at the age of 21]]Kubrick shared a love of film with his school friend Alexander Singer, who after graduating from high school had the intention of directing a film version of Homer's ''[[The Iliad]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Through Singer, who worked in the offices of the newsreel production company, [[The March of Time]], Kubrick learned that it could cost $40,000 to make a proper short film, money he could not afford</span>
				<span class='text'>However, he had $1500 in savings and managed to produce a few short documentaries fueled by encouragement from Singer</span>
				<span class='text'>He began learning all he could about filmmaking on his own, calling film suppliers, laboratories, and equipment rental houses</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=23}}Kubrick decided to make a short film documentary about boxer [[Walter Cartier]], whom he had photographed and written about for ''Look'' magazine a year earlier</span>
				<span class='text'>He rented a camera and produced a 16-minute black-and-white documentary, ''[[Day of the Fight]]''</span>
				<span class='text'> Kubrick found the money independently to finance it</span>
				<span class='text'> He had considered asking [[Montgomery Clift]] to narrate it, whom he had met during a photographic session for ''Look'', but settled on CBS news veteran [[Douglas Edwards]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=68}} According to Paul Duncan the film was &quot;remarkably accomplished for a first film&quot;, and was notable for using the reverse tracking shot to film a scene in which the brothers walk towards the camera, a device later to become one of Kubrick's characteristic camera movements</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=25}} Vincent Cartier, Walter's brother and manager, later reflected on his observations of Kubrick during the filming</span>
				<span class='text'> He said, &quot;Stanley was very stoic, impassive but imaginative type person with strong, imaginative thoughts</span>
				<span class='text'>He commanded respect in a quiet, shy way</span>
				<span class='text'>Whatever he wanted, you complied, he just captivated you</span>
				<span class='text'>Anybody who worked with Stanley did just what Stanley wanted&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=23}}{{efn|Walter Cartier also said of Kubrick: &quot;Stanley comes in prepared like a fighter for a big fight, he knows exactly what he's doing, where he's going and what he wants to accomplish</span>
				<span class='text'>He knew the challenges and he overcame them&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=59}}}}  After a score was added by Singer's friend Gerald Fried, Kubrick had spent $3900 in making it, and sold it to RKO-Pathé  for $4000, which was the most the company had ever paid for a short film at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=25}}  Kubrick described his first effort at filmmaking as having been valuable since he believed himself to have been forced to do most of the work,{{Sfn|King|Molloy|Tzioumakis|2013|p=156}} and he later declared that the &quot;best education in film is to make one&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=15}}Inspired by this early success, Kubrick quit his job at ''Look'' and visited professional filmmakers in New York City, asking many detailed questions about the technical aspects of film-making</span>
				<span class='text'>He stated that he was given the confidence during this period to become a filmmaker because of the number of bad films he had seen, remarking, &quot;I don't know a goddamn thing about movies, but I know I can make a better film than that&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=13}} He began making ''[[Flying Padre]]'' (1951), a film which documents Reverend Fred Stadtmueller, who travels some 4,000 miles to visit his 11 churches</span>
				<span class='text'>The film was originally going to be called &quot;Sky Pilot&quot;, a pun on the slang term for a priest</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=39}}  During the course of the film, the priest performs a burial service, confronts a boy bullying a girl, and makes an emergency flight to aid a sick mother and baby into an ambulance</span>
				<span class='text'>Several of the views from and of the plane in ''Flying Padre'' are later echoed in ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968) with the footage of the spacecraft, and a series of close-ups on the faces of people attending the funeral were most likely inspired by Sergei Eisenstein's ''[[Battleship Potemkin]]'' (1925) and ''[[Ivan the Terrible]]'' (1944/1958)</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=25}}''Flying Padre'' was followed by ''[[The Seafarers]]'' (1953), Kubrick's first color film, which was shot for the [[Seafarers International Union of North America|Seafarers International Union]] in June 1953</span>
				<span class='text'>It has shots of ships, machinery, a canteen, and a union meeting</span>
				<span class='text'>For the cafeteria scene in the film, Kubrick chose a long, sideways-shooting [[dolly shot]] to establish the life of the seafarer's community; this shot is an early demonstration of a technique which would become a signature of his</span>
				<span class='text'>The montage of speaker and audience echoes scenes from Eisenstein's ''[[Strike (1925 film)|Strike]]'' (1925) and ''[[October: Ten Days That Shook the World|October]]'' (1928)</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=28}} ''Day of the Fight'', ''Flying Padre'' and ''The Seafarers'' constitute Kubrick's only surviving documentary works, although some historians believe he made others</span>

				<span class='text'>ebm|thumb|''Fear and Desire'' (1953)]]After raising $1000 showing his short films to friends and family, Kubrick found the finances to begin making his first feature film, ''[[Fear and Desire]]'' (1953), originally running with the title ''The Trap'', written by his friend [[Howard Sackler]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Kubrick's uncle, Martin Perveler, a Los Angeles businessman, invested a further $9000 on condition that he be credited as executive producer of the film</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=26}}  Kubrick assembled several actors and a small crew totaling 14 people (five actors, five crewmen, and four Mexicans to help transport the equipment) and flew to the [[San Gabriel Mountains]] in California for a five-week, low-budget shoot</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=26}}   Later renamed ''The Shape of Fear'' before finally being named ''Fear and Desire'', it is a fictional [[allegory]] about a team of soldiers who survive a plane crash and are caught behind enemy lines in a war</span>
				<span class='text'>During the course of the film, one of the soldiers becomes infatuated with an attractive girl in the woods and binds her to a tree</span>
				<span class='text'>This scene is noted for its close-ups on the face of the actress</span>
				<span class='text'>Kubrick had intended for ''Fear and Desire'' to be a [[silent film|silent picture]] in order to ensure low production costs; the added sounds, effects, and music ultimately brought production costs to around $53,000, exceeding the budget</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=50}} He was bailed out by producer [[Richard de Rochemont]] on the condition that he help in de Rochemont's production of a five-part television series about [[Abraham Lincoln]] on location in [[Hodgenville, Kentucky]]</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|260px|A model of the bedroom which appeared at the end of ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'']]Kubrick spent five years developing his next film, ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' (1968), having been highly impressed with science fiction writer [[Arthur C</span>
				<span class='text'>Clarke]]'s novel ''Childhood's End'', about a superior race of alien beings who assist mankind in eliminating their old selves</span>
				<span class='text'>After meeting Clarke in New York City in April 1964, Kubrick made the suggestion to work on his 1948 short story ''The Sentinel'', about a tetrahedron which is found on the Moon which alerts aliens of mankind</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=205}}{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=105}} That year, Clarke began writing the novel ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', and the screenplay was written by Kubrick and Clarke in collaboration</span>
				<span class='text'>The film's theme, the birthing of one intelligence by another, is developed in two parallel intersecting stories on two very different times scales</span>
				<span class='text'>One depicts transitions between various stages of man, from ape to &quot;star child&quot;, as man is reborn into a new existence, each step shepherded by an enigmatic alien intelligence seen only in its artifacts: a series of seemingly indestructible eons-old black monoliths</span>
				<span class='text'>In space, the enemy is a supercomputer known as HAL who runs the spaceship, a character which novelist [[Clancy Sigal]] described as being &quot;far, far more human, more humorous and conceivably decent than anything else that may emerge from this far-seeing enterprise&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=208}}{{efn|Several commentators have speculated that HAL is a slur on IBM, with the letters alphabetically falling before it, and point out that Kubrick inspected the IBM 7090 during ''Dr Strangelove''</span>
				<span class='text'>However, both Kubrick and Clarke have denied this, and insist that HAL simply means &quot;Heuristically  Programmed Algorithmic Computer&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=214–5}}}}Kubrick spent a great deal of time researching the film, paying particular attention to accuracy and detail in what the future may look like</span>
				<span class='text'>He was granted permission by [[NASA]] to observe the spacecraft being used in the [[Ranger 9]] mission for accuracy</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=113}} Filming commenced on December 29, 1965, with the excavation of the monolith on the moon,{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=117}} and footage was shot in [[Namib Desert]] in early 1967, with the ape scenes completed in the summer of that year</span>
				<span class='text'>The special effects team continued working diligently until the end of the year to complete the film, taking the cost to $10</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=117}} ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' was conceived as a [[Cinerama]] spectacle and was photographed in [[Super Panavision 70]], giving the viewer a &quot;dazzling mix of imagination and science&quot; through ground-breaking effects, which earned Kubrick his only personal Oscar, an [[Academy Award for Visual Effects]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=117}}{{Efn|Biographer John Baxter quotes Ken Adam as saying that Kubrick was not actually responsible for most of the effects, and that Wally Veevers was the man behind about 85% of them in film</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Baxter notes that none of the film's technical team resented Kubrick taking sole credit, as &quot;it was Kubrick's vision which appeared on the screen&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Baxter|1997|pp=224, 235}}}} Louise Sweeney of the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' called the film the &quot;ultimate trip&quot; while praising one of the scenes where the viewer moves through space while witnessing a vibrant mix of lighting, color, and patterns</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=233}} Kubrick said of the concept of the film in an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'': &quot;On the deepest psychological level, the film's plot symbolized the search for God, and finally postulates what is little less than a scientific definition of God</span>
				<span class='text'>The film revolves around this metaphysical conception, and the realistic hardware and the documentary feelings about everything were necessary in order to undermine your built-in resistance to the poetical concept&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=313}}Upon release in 1968, ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' was not an immediate hit among many critics, who faulted its lack of dialogue, slow pacing, and seemingly impenetrable storyline</span>
				<span class='text'>{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=231}}{{sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=314}} The film appeared to defy genre convention, much unlike any science-fiction movie before it,{{sfn|Schneider|2012|p=492}} and clearly different from any of Kubrick's earlier films or stories</span>
				<span class='text'>Kubrick was particularly outraged by a scathing review from [[Pauline Kael]], who called it &quot;the biggest amateur movie of them all&quot;, with Kubrick doing &quot;really every dumb thing he ever wanted to do&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{{sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=312}} Despite the initial poor critical response, ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' gradually gained popularity and earned $31 million worldwide by the end of 1972</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|250px|An example of the erotica from ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' (1971)]]After completing ''2001: A Space Odyssey'', Kubrick searched for a project that he could film quickly on a small budget</span>
				<span class='text'>He settled on ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' (1971) at the end of 1969, an exploration of violence and experimental rehabilitation by law enforcement authorities, based around the character of [[Alex (A Clockwork Orange)|Alex]] (portrayed by [[Malcolm McDowell]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Kubrick had originally received a copy of [[Anthony Burgess]]'s [[A Clockwork Orange|novel of the same name]] from Terry Southern while they were working on ''Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Strangelove'', but had rejected it on the grounds that Nadsat,{{Efn|The name is derived from the Russian suffix for &quot;teen&quot;}} a street language for young teenagers, was too difficult to comprehend</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1969, the decision to make a film about the degeneration of youth was a more timely one; the [[New Hollywood]] movement was witnessing a great number of films that were centered around the sexuality and rebelliousness of young people, which no doubt influenced Kubrick in Baxter's opinion</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=243}}  ''A Clockwork Orange'' was shot over the winter of 1970-1 on a budget of £2 million</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=129}} Kubrick abandoned his use of CinemaScope in the filming, deciding that the 1</span>
				<span class='text'>6:1 widescreen format was, in the words of Baxter, an &quot;acceptable compromise between spectacle and intimacy&quot;, and favored his &quot;rigorously symmetrical framing&quot;, which &quot;increased the beauty of his compositions&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=252}} The film heavily features &quot;pop erotica&quot; of the period, including a giant white plastic set of male genitals, decor which Kubrick had intended to give it a &quot;slightly futuristic&quot; look</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Baxter|1997|pp=246–7}}}} and Kubrick professed that he probably would not have made the film if McDowell had been unavailable</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=247}}Because of its depiction of teenage violence, ''A Clockwork Orange'' became one of the most controversial films of the decade, and part of an ongoing debate about violence and its glorification in cinema</span>
				<span class='text'>It received an X-rated certificate upon release, just before Christmas in 1971, though many critics saw much of the violence depicted in the film as satirical, and less violent than ''[[Straw Dogs (1971 film)|Straw Dogs]]'', which had been released a month earlier</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Baxter|1997|pp=255, 264–65}} Kubrick personally pulled the film from release in the United Kingdom after receiving death threats following a series of copycat crimes based on the film; it was thus completely unavailable legally in the UK until after Kubrick's death, and not re-released until 2000</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Webster|2010|p=86}}{{Efn|Despite this, Kubrick disagreed with many of the scathing press reports in British media in the early 1970s that the film could transform a person into a criminal, and argued that &quot;violent crime is invariably committed by people with a long record of anti-social behavior&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Ciment|1980|pp=162–3}}}} John Trevelyan, the censor of the film, personally considered ''A Clockwork Orange'' to be &quot;perhaps the most brilliant piece of cinematic art I've ever seen, and believed it to present an &quot;intellectual argument rather than a sadistic spectacle&quot; in its depiction of violence, but acknowledged that many would not agree</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Baxter|1997|p=265}} Ignoring the negative media hype over the film, ''A Clockwork Orange'' received four Academy Award nominations, for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Editing, and was named by the [[New York Film Critics Circle]] as the Best Film of 1971</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=9}}He was very careful not to present his own views of the meaning of his films and leave them open to interpretation</span>
				<span class='text'>He explained in a 1960 interview with Robert Emmett Ginna: &quot;One of the things I always find extremely difficult, when a picture's finished, is when a writer or a film reviewer asks, 'Now, what is it that you were trying to say in that picture?' And without being thought too presumptuous for using this analogy, I like to remember what [[T</span>
				<span class='text'>S</span>
				<span class='text'>Eliot]] said to someone who had asked him—I believe it was ''[[The Waste Land]]''—what he meant by the poem</span>
				<span class='text'>He replied, 'I meant what I said'</span>
				<span class='text'>If I could have said it any differently, I would have&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=12}} Kubrick likened the understanding of his films to popular music, in that whatever the background or intellect of the individual, a Beatles record, for instance, can both be appreciated by the Alabama truck driver and the young Cambridge intellectual in the way that his films can because their &quot;emotions and subconscious are far more similar than their intellects&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He believed that the subconscious emotional reaction evoked by audiences was far more powerful in the film medium than in any other traditional verbal form, and was one of the reasons why he often relied on long periods in his films without dialogue, placing emphasis on images and sound</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=12}} In a ''Time'' magazine interview in 1975, Kubrick further stated: &quot;The essence of a dramatic form is to let an idea come over people without it being plainly stated</span>
				<span class='text'>When you say something directly, it is simply not as potent as it is when you allow people to discover it for themselves</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=13}} He also said &quot;Realism is probably the best way to dramatize argument and ideas</span>
				<span class='text'>Fantasy may deal best with themes which lie primarily in the unconscious&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Which is what he's always done, except with ''Lolita''&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Ciment|1980|p=293}} When deciding on a subject for a film, there were a number of aspects that he looked for, and he always made films which would &quot;appeal to every sort of viewer, whatever their expectation of film&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Walker|1972|p=38}}Although none of his features display graphic sex scenes, sexuality in Kubrick's films is usually depicted outside matrimonial relationships in hostile situations</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=248}} He further points out that films like ''A Clockwork Orange'' are &quot;powerfully homoerotic&quot;, from Alex walking about his parents' flat in his Y-fronts, one eye being &quot;made up with doll-like false eyelashes&quot;, to his innocent acceptance of the sexual advances of his post-corrective adviser Deltroid ([[Aubrey Morris]])</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=250}} British critic Adrian Turner notes that Kubrick's films appear to be &quot;preoccupied with questions of universal and inherited evil&quot;, and Malcolm McDowell referred to his humor as &quot;black as coal&quot;, questioning his outlook on humanity</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=14}} Although a few of his pictures were obvious satires and black comedies, such as ''Lolita'' and ''Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Strangelove'', many of his other films also contained less visible elements of satire or irony</span>
				<span class='text'>His films are unpredictable, examining &quot;the duality and contradictions that exist in all of us&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=10}} Ciment notes how Kubrick often tried to confound audience expectations by establishing radically different moods from one film to the next, remarking that he was almost &quot;obsessed with contradicting himself, with making each work a critique of the previous one&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Ciment|1980|p=59}}Kubrick stated himself that &quot;there is no deliberate pattern to the stories that I have chosen to make into films</span>
				<span class='text'>About the only factor at work each time is that I try not to repeat myself&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Ciment|1980|p=153}} As a result, Kubrick was often misunderstood by critics, and only once did he have unanimously positive reviews upon the release of a film—for ''Paths of Glory''</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Webster|2010|p=68}} Malcolm McDowell recalled Kubrick's collaborative emphasis during their discussions and his willingness to allow him to improvize a scene, stating that &quot;there was a script and we followed it, but when it didn't work he knew it, and we had to keep rehearsing endlessly until we were bored with it</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=68}}Once Kubrick was confident in the overall staging of a scene, and felt the actors were prepared, he would then develop the visual aspects, including camera and lighting placement</span>
				<span class='text'>Walker believes that Kubrick was one of &quot;very few film directors competent to instruct their lighting photographers in the precise effect they want</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Walker|1972|p=26}} Baxter believes that although American, Kubrick was heavily influenced by his ancestry and always possessed a European perspective to filmmaking, particularly the Austro-Hungarian empire and his admiration for Johann Ophuls and [[Richard Strauss]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=13}}[[Gilbert Adair]], writing in a review for ''Full Metal Jacket'', commented that &quot;Kubrick's approach to language has always been of a reductive and uncompromisingly deterministic nature</span>
				<span class='text'>He appears to view it as the exclusive product of environmental conditioning, only very marginally influenced by concepts of subjectivity and interiority, by all whims, shades and modulations of personal expression&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Duncan|2003|pp=12–3}} Johnson notes that although Kubrick was a &quot;visual filmmaker,&quot; he also loved words and was like a writer in his approach, very sensitive to the story itself, which he found unique</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Ciment|1980|p=295}} Before shooting began, Kubrick tried to have the script as complete as possible, but still allowed himself enough space to make changes during the actual filming, finding it &quot;more profitable to avoid locking up any ideas about staging or camera or even dialogue prior to rehearsals&quot; as he put it</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Walker|1972|p=26}} Kubrick told Robert Emmett Ginna: &quot;I think you have to view the entire problem of putting the story you want to tell up there on that light square</span>
				<span class='text'>It begins with the selection of the property; it continues through the creation of the story, the sets, the costumes, the photography and the acting</span>
				<span class='text'>And when the picture is shot, it's only partially finished</span>
				<span class='text'>I think the cutting is just a continuation of directing a movie</span>
				<span class='text'>I think the use of music effects, opticals and finally main titles are all part of telling the story</span>
				<span class='text'>And I think the fragmentation of these jobs, by different people, is a very bad thing&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=145}} Kubrick also said: &quot;I think that the best plot is no apparent plot</span>
				<span class='text'>I like a slow start, the start that gets under the audience's skin and involves them so that they can appreciate grace notes and soft tones and don't have to be pounded over the head with plot points and suspense tools</span>

				<span class='text'>{Sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=403}} Kubrick explained: &quot;Actors are essentially emotion-producing instruments, and some are always tuned and ready while others will reach a fantastic pitch on one take and never equal it again, no matter how hard they try&quot;&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=94}} &quot;When you make a movie, it takes a few days just to get used to the crew, because it is like getting undressed in front of fifty people</span>
				<span class='text'>Once you're accustomed to them, the presence of even one other person on set is discordant and tends to produce self-consciousness in the actors, and certainly in itself&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=73}} He also told biographer Michel Clement: &quot;It's invariably because the actors don't know their lines, or don't know them well enough</span>
				<span class='text'>An actor can only do one thing at a time, and when he learned his lines only well enough to say them while he's thinking about them, he will always have trouble as soon as he has to work on the emotions of the scene or find camera marks</span>
				<span class='text'>In a strong emotional scene, it is always best to be able to shoot in complete takes to allow the actor a continuity of emotion, and it is rare for most actors to reach their peak more than once or twice</span>
				<span class='text'>There are, occasionally, scenes which benefit from extra takes, but even then, I'm not sure that the early takes aren't just glorified rehearsals with the adding adrenaline of film running through the camera</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=153}}Kubrick would devote his personal breaks to having lengthy discussions with actors</span>
				<span class='text'>Among those who valued his attention was Tony Curtis, star of ''Spartacus'', who said Kubrick was his favorite director, adding, &quot;his greatest effectiveness was his one-on-one relationship with actors</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=193}} He further added, &quot;Kubrick had his own approach to film-making</span>
				<span class='text'>He wanted to see the actor's faces</span>
				<span class='text'>He didn't want cameras always in a wide shot twenty-five feet away, he wanted close-ups, he wanted to keep the camera moving</span>
				<span class='text'>That was his style</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=2}} Similarly, Malcolm McDowell recalls the long discussions he had with Kubrick to help him develop his character in ''A Clockwork Orange'', noting that on set he felt entirely uninhibited and free, which is what made Kubrick &quot;such a great director</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Ciment|1980|p=38}} Kubrick also allowed actors at times to improvize and to &quot;break the rules&quot;, particularly with Peter Sellers in ''Lolita'', which became a turning point in his career as it allowed him to work creatively during the actual shooting, as opposed to the preproduction stage</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Walker|1981|p=136}}During an interview, Ryan O'Neal recalled Kubrick's directing style: &quot;God, he works you hard</span>
				<span class='text'>He moves you, pushes you, helps you, gets cross with you, but above all he teaches you the value of a good director</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Ciment|1980|p=196}} He rarely added camera instructions in the script, preferring to handle that after a scene is created, as the visual part of film-making came easiest to him</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Ciment|1980|p=177}} Even in deciding which props and settings would be used, Kubrick paid meticulous attention to detail and tried to collect as much background material as possible, functioning rather like what he described as &quot;a detective&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Ciment|1980|p=176}} Cinematographer John Alcott, who worked closely with Kubrick on four of his films, and won an Oscar for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] on ''Barry Lyndon'', remarked that Kubrick &quot;questions everything&quot;,{{sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=407}} and was involved in the technical aspects of film-making including camera placement, scene composition, choice of lens, and even operating the camera which would usually be left to the cinematographer</span>

				<span class='text'>Kubrick used it to its fullest potential, which gave the audience smooth, stabilized, motion-tracking by the camera</span>
				<span class='text'>Kubrick described Steadicam as being like a &quot;magic carpet&quot;, allowing &quot;fast, flowing, camera movements&quot; in the maze in ''The Shining'' which would otherwise would have been impossible to accomplish</span>

				<span class='text'>At the time he began using it in 1966, it was considered cutting-edge technology, requiring him to build his own system</span>
				<span class='text'>Having it in place during the filming of ''2001'', he was able to view a video of a take immediately after it was filmed</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=294}} On some films, such as ''Barry Lyndon'', he used custom made zoom lenses, which allowed him to start a scene with a close-up and slowly zoom out to capture the full panorama of scenery and to film long takes under changing outdoor lighting conditions by making aperture adjustments while the cameras rolled</span>
				<span class='text'>LoBrutto notes that Kubrick's technical knowledge about lenses &quot;dazzled the manufacturer's engineers, who found him to be unprecedented among contemporary filmmakers</span>

				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Walker|1972|p=42}} For Kubrick, written dialogue was one element to be put in balance with [[mise en scène]] (set arrangements), music, and especially, editing</span>
				<span class='text'>Inspired by [[Vsevolod Pudovkin|Pudovkin]]'s treatise on film editing, Kubrick realized that one could create a performance in the editing room and often &quot;re-direct&quot; a film, and he remarked: &quot;I love editing</span>
				<span class='text'>I think I like it more than any other phase of filmmaking&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Editing is the only unique aspect of filmmaking which does not resemble any other art form—a point so important it cannot be overstressed&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>It can make or break a film&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Walker|1972|p=42}} Biographer John Baxter stated that &quot;Instead of finding the intellectual spine of a film in the script before starting work, Kubrick felt his way towards the final version of a film by shooting each scene from many angles and demanding scores of takes on each line</span>
				<span class='text'>Then over months&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>he arranged and rearranged the tens of thousands of scraps of film to fit a vision that really only began to emerge during editing&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Baxter|1997|p=6}}Kubrick's attention to music was an aspect of what many referred to as his &quot;perfectionism&quot; and extreme attention to minute details, which his wife Christine attributed to an addiction to music</span>
				<span class='text'>In his last six films, Kubrick usually chose music from existing sources, especially classical compositions</span>
				<span class='text'>He preferred selecting recorded music over having it composed for a film, believing that no hired composer could do as well as the public domain classical composers</span>
				<span class='text'>He also felt that building scenes from great music often created the &quot;most memorable scenes&quot; in the best films</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Ciment|1980|pp=153, 156}} In one instance, for a scene in ''Barry Lyndon'' which was written into the screenplay as merely, &quot;Barry duels with Lord Bullingdon,&quot; he spent forty-two working days in the editing phase</span>
				<span class='text'>During that period, he listened to what LoBrutto describes as &quot;every available recording of seventeenth-and eighteenth- century music, acquiring thousands of records to find [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]'s sarabande used to score the scene</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{Sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=405}} Jack Nicholson likewise observed his attention to music for his films, stating that Kubrick &quot;listened constantly to music until he discovered something he felt was right or that excited him</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=225}} In the film, Kubrick employed the new style of [[micropolyphony]], which used sustained dissonant chords that shift slowly over time, a style which he originated</span>

				<span class='text'>His new home became a workplace for Kubrick and his wife, &quot;a perfect family factory&quot; as Christiane called it,{{Sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=374}} and Kubrick converted the stables into extra production rooms besides ones within the home that he used for editing and storage</span>
