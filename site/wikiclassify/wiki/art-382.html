				<span class='text'>His father, [[Miles Dewey Davis, Jr</span>
				<span class='text'>], was a dentist</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1927 the family moved to [[East St</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis, Illinois|East St</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis]], [[Illinois]]</span>
				<span class='text'>They also owned a substantial ranch in the Delta region of [[Arkansas]] near the city of [[Pine Bluff]], where Davis's father and grandfather were from</span>
				<span class='text'>It was in both East St</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis and near Pine Bluff that young Davis developed his earliest appreciation for music listening to the gospel music of the black church</span>

				<span class='text'>2014]]Davis' mother, Cleota Mae Davis (née Henry), wanted her son to learn the piano; she was a capable blues pianist but did not tell Miles</span>
				<span class='text'>His musical studies began at 13, when his father gave him a trumpet and arranged lessons with local musician [[Elwood Buchanan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Davis later suggested that his father's instrument choice was made largely to irk his wife, who disliked the trumpet's sound</span>
				<span class='text'>Against the fashion of the time, Buchanan stressed the importance of playing without [[vibrato]]; he was reported to have slapped Davis' knuckles every time he started using heavy [[vibrato]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;abio&quot;&gt;[[#Bio|''The Autobiography'']]</span>
				<span class='text'>{{page needed|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis would carry his clear signature tone throughout his career</span>
				<span class='text'>He once remarked on its importance to him, saying, &quot;I prefer a round sound with no attitude in it, like a round voice with not too much [[tremolo]] and not too much bass</span>
				<span class='text'>Just right in the middle</span>
				<span class='text'>If I can’t get that sound I can’t play anything</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;KAHN2001&quot;&gt;[[#Kahn|Kahn]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clark Terry]] was another important early influence</span>
				<span class='text'>y age 16, Davis was a member of the music society and, when not at school, playing professionally first at the local [[Elks Club]]</span>

				<span class='text'>During this time, [[Sonny Stitt]] tried to persuade him to join the Tiny Bradshaw band, then passing through town, but Davis' mother insisted that he finish his final year of high school</span>
				<span class='text'>He graduated from East St</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis Lincoln High School in 1944</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1944, the [[Billy Eckstine]] band visited East St</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Dizzy Gillespie]] and [[Charlie Parker]] were members of the band; they invited Davis to play third trumpet for a couple of weeks because their regular member, Buddy Anderson, was ill</span>
				<span class='text'>Even after this experience, once Eckstine's band left town, Davis' parents were still keen for him to continue formal academic studies</span>
				<span class='text'>==New York City and the bebop years (1944–48)===In the fall of 1944, following graduation from high school, Davis moved to New York City to study at the [[Juilliard School]] of Music</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon arriving in New York City, he spent most of his first weeks in town trying to get in contact with [[Charlie Parker]], despite being advised against doing so by several people he met during his quest, including [[saxophone|saxophonist]] [[Coleman Hawkins]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;abio&quot;/&gt;[[File:Charlie Parker, Tommy Potter, Miles Davis, Duke Jordan, Max Roach (Gottlieb 06851)</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|[[Coleman Hawkins]] and Miles Davis, c</span>
				<span class='text'>September 1947]]Finally locating his idol, Davis became one of the cadre of musicians who held nightly [[jam session]]s at two of [[Harlem]]'s nightclubs, [[Minton's Playhouse]] and [[Monroe's]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The group included many of the future leaders of the [[bebop]] revolution: young players such as [[Fats Navarro]], [[Freddie Webster]], and [[J</span>
				<span class='text'>J</span>
				<span class='text'>Johnson]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Established musicians including [[Thelonious Monk]] and [[Kenny Clarke]] were also regular participants</span>
				<span class='text'>avis dropped out of Juilliard after asking permission from his father</span>
				<span class='text'>In his autobiography, Davis criticized the Juilliard classes for centering too much on the classical European and &quot;white&quot; repertoire</span>
				<span class='text'>He also acknowledged however that, in addition to greatly improving his trumpet playing technique, Juilliard helped give him a grounding in music theory that would prove valuable in later years</span>
				<span class='text'>avis began playing professionally, performing in several [[52nd Street]] clubs with Coleman Hawkins and [[Eddie &quot;Lockjaw&quot; Davis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1945, he entered a recording studio for the first time, as a member of [[Herbie Fields]]'s group</span>
				<span class='text'>This was the first of many recordings Davis contributed to in this period, mostly as a [[sideman]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He finally got the chance to record as a leader in 1946, with an occasional group called the Miles Davis Sextet plus Earl Coleman and Ann Hathaway—one of the rare occasions when Davis, by then a member of the groundbreaking Charlie Parker Quintet, can be heard accompanying singers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>om |date=1946-10-18 |accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these early years, recording sessions where Davis was the leader were the exception rather than the rule; his next date as leader would not come until 1947</span>
				<span class='text'>round 1945, [[Dizzy Gillespie]] parted ways with Parker, and Davis was hired as Gillespie's replacement in his quintet, which also featured [[Max Roach]] on drums, [[Al Haig]] (replaced later by [[Sir Charles Thompson]] and [[Duke Jordan]]) on piano, and [[Curley Russell]] (later replaced by [[Tommy Potter]] and [[Leonard Gaskin]]) on bass</span>
				<span class='text'>ith Parker's quintet, Davis went into the studio several times, already showing hints of the style he would become known for</span>
				<span class='text'>On an oft-quoted take of Parker's signature song, &quot;Now's the Time&quot;, Davis takes a melodic solo, whose unbop-like quality anticipates the &quot;[[cool jazz]]&quot; period that followed</span>
				<span class='text'>The Parker quintet also toured widely</span>
				<span class='text'>During a stop in Los Angeles, Parker had a [[nervous breakdown]] that landed him in the [[Camarillo State Mental Hospital]] for several months, and Davis found himself stranded</span>
				<span class='text'>He roomed and collaborated for some time with bassist [[Charles Mingus]], before getting a job on [[Billy Eckstine]]'s California tour, which eventually brought him back to New York</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;On this occasion, Mingus bitterly criticized Davis for abandoning his &quot;musical father&quot; (see [[#Bio|''The Autobiography'']])</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, Parker returned to New York, and Davis rejoined his group</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Howard McGhee, Brick Fleagle and Miles Davis, ca September 1947 (Gottlieb)</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Miles Davis on piano with [[Howard McGhee]] (trumpet), Joe Albany (pianist, standing) and [[Brick Fleagle]] (guitarist, smoking), September 1947]]The relationships within the quintet were growing tense however</span>
				<span class='text'>Parker was behaving erratically due to his well-known drug addiction</span>
				<span class='text'>Davis and Roach caused friction in the group by objecting to having Duke Jordan as a pianist&lt;ref name=&quot;abio&quot;/&gt; and would have preferred [[Bud Powell]]</span>
				<span class='text'>By December 1948, Davis' claims that he was not being paid began to strain the relationship even further</span>
				<span class='text'>Davis finally left the group following a confrontation with Parker at the [[Royal Roost]]</span>
				<span class='text'>or Davis, his departure from Parker's group marked the beginning of a period when he worked mainly as a freelancer and sideman in some of the most important combos on the New York City jazz scene</span>
				<span class='text'>==Birth of the Cool (1948–49)===In 1948 Davis grew close to the Canadian composer and arranger [[Gil Evans]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Evans' basement apartment had become the meeting place for several young musicians and composers such as Davis, Roach, pianist [[John Lewis (pianist)|John Lewis]], and baritone sax player [[Gerry Mulligan]] who were unhappy with the increasingly virtuoso instrumental techniques that dominated the bebop scene</span>
				<span class='text'>Evans had been the arranger for the [[Claude Thornhill]] orchestra, and it was the sound of this group, as well as [[Duke Ellington]]'s example, that suggested the creation of an unusual line-up: a [[Nonet (music)|nonet]] including a [[French horn]] and a [[tuba]] (this accounts for the &quot;tuba band&quot; moniker that became associated with the combo)</span>
				<span class='text'>avis took an active role in the project,&lt;ref&gt;Mulligan, Gerry</span>
				<span class='text'>''[http://www</span>
				<span class='text'>errymulligan</span>
				<span class='text'>om/wp-content/files/auto-bio</span>
				<span class='text'>df I hear America singing]'': &quot;Miles, the bandleader</span>
				<span class='text'>He took the initiative and put the theories to work</span>
				<span class='text'>He called the rehearsals, hired the halls, called the players, and generally cracked the whip</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt; so much so that it soon became &quot;his project&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The objective was to achieve a sound similar to the human voice, through carefully arranged compositions and by emphasizing a relaxed, melodic approach to the improvisations</span>
				<span class='text'>he nonet debuted in the summer of 1948, with a two-week engagement at the Royal Roost</span>
				<span class='text'>The sign announcing the performance gave a surprising prominence to the role of the arrangers: &quot;Miles Davis Nonet</span>
				<span class='text'>Arrangements by Gil Evans, John Lewis and Gerry Mulligan</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; It was, in fact, so unusual that Davis had to persuade the Roost's manager, Ralph Watkins, to word the sign this way</span>
				<span class='text'>He prevailed only with the help of [[Monte Kay]], the club's artistic director</span>
				<span class='text'>he nonet was active until the end of 1949, along the way undergoing several changes in personnel: Roach and Davis were constantly featured, along with Mulligan, tuba player [[Bill Barber (musician)|Bill Barber]], and alto saxophonist [[Lee Konitz]], who had been preferred to [[Sonny Stitt]] (whose playing was considered too bop-oriented)</span>
				<span class='text'>Over the months, John Lewis alternated with Al Haig on piano, [[Mike Zwerin]] with [[Kai Winding]] on trombone (Johnson was touring at the time), [[Junior Collins]] with Sandy Siegelstein and [[Gunther Schuller]] on [[French horn]], and [[Al McKibbon]] with [[Joe Shulman]] on bass</span>
				<span class='text'>Singer [[Kenny Hagood]] was added for one track during the recording</span>
				<span class='text'>he presence of white musicians in the group angered some black jazz players, many of whom were unemployed at the time, but Davis rebuffed their criticisms</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;&quot;So I just told them that if a guy could play as good as [[Lee Konitz]] played—that's who they were mad about most, because there were a lot of black alto players around—I would hire him every time, and I wouldn't give a damn if he was green with red breath</span>
				<span class='text'>I'm hiring a motherfucker to play, not for what color he is</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; [[#Bio|''The Autobiography'']]&lt;/ref&gt;A contract with [[Capitol Records]] granted the nonet several recording sessions between January 1949 and April 1950</span>
				<span class='text'>The material they recorded was released in 1956 on an album whose title, ''[[Birth of the Cool]]'', gave its name to the &quot;[[cool jazz]]&quot; movement that developed at the same time and partly shared the musical direction begun by Davis' group</span>
				<span class='text'>or his part, Davis was fully aware of the importance of the project, which he pursued to the point of turning down a job with [[Duke Ellington]]'s orchestra</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;abio&quot;/&gt;The importance of the nonet experience would become clear to critics and the larger public only in later years, but, at least commercially, the nonet was not a success</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[liner notes]] of the first recordings of the Davis Quintet for [[Columbia Records]] call it one of the most spectacular failures of the jazz club scene</span>
				<span class='text'>This was bitterly noted by Davis, who claimed the invention of the cool style and resented the success that was later enjoyed—in large part because of the media's attention—by white &quot;cool jazz&quot; musicians (Mulligan and [[Dave Brubeck]] in particular)</span>
				<span class='text'>his experience also marked the beginning of the lifelong friendship between Davis and Gil Evans, an alliance that would bear important results in the years to follow</span>
				<span class='text'>==Hard bop and the &quot;Blue Period&quot; (1950–54)===The first half of the 1950s was, for Davis, a period of great personal difficulty</span>
				<span class='text'>At the end of 1949, he went on tour in [[Paris]] with a group including [[Tadd Dameron]], [[Kenny Clarke]] (who remained in [[Europe]] after the tour), and [[James Moody (saxophonist)|James Moody]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Davis was fascinated by Paris and its cultural environment, where black jazz musicians, and African Americans in general, often felt better respected than they did in their homeland</span>
				<span class='text'>While in Paris, Davis began a relationship with French actress and singer [[Juliette Gréco]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough many of his new and old friends (Davis, in his autobiography, mentions Clarke) tried to persuade him to stay in [[France]], Davis decided to return to New York City</span>
				<span class='text'>Back in the USA, he began to feel deeply depressed</span>
				<span class='text'>He attributed the depression to his separation from Gréco, his feeling under-appreciated by the critics (who hailed his former collaborators as leaders of the cool jazz movement)—and to the unraveling of his liaison with a former St</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis schoolmate who lived with him in New York City, with whom he had two children</span>
				<span class='text'>avis blamed these factors for the [[heroin]] habit that deeply affected him for the next four years</span>
				<span class='text'>During this period,  Davis supported his habit partly with his music and partly by living the life of a hustler</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;In his autobiography Davis recalls exploiting prostitutes and getting money from most of his friends</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; By 1953, his drug [[addiction]] began to impair his playing ability</span>
				<span class='text'>Heroin had killed some of his friends (Navarro and Freddie Webster)</span>
				<span class='text'>He had been arrested for drug possession while on tour in [[Los Angeles]], and his drug habit became public in a ''Down Beat'' interview of [[Cab Calloway]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;In his autobiography, Davis says he never forgave Calloway for that interview</span>
				<span class='text'>He also says that African Americans were being unfairly singled out among the larger community of drug-using jazz musicians of the time</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Realizing his precarious condition, Davis tried several times to end his drug addiction, finally succeeding in 1954 after returning to his father's home in St</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis for several months and locking himself in a room until he had gone through a painful withdrawal</span>
				<span class='text'>During this period, he avoided New York City and played mostly in [[Detroit]] and other [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] towns, where drugs were then harder to come by</span>

				<span class='text'>Davis was supposedly embarrassed into getting clean by this incident</span>
				<span class='text'>In his autobiography, Davis disputed this account, stating that Roach had requested that Davis play with him that night, and that the details of the incident, such as carrying his horn in a paper bag and interrupting Roach and Brown, were fictional and that his decision to quit heroin was unrelated to the incident</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[#Bio|''The Autobiography'']], pp</span>
				<span class='text'>173–174&lt;/ref&gt;Despite all the personal turmoil, the 1950–54 period proved to be a fruitful one for Davis artistically</span>
				<span class='text'>He made quite a number of recordings and had several collaborations with other important musicians</span>
				<span class='text'>He got to know the music of Chicago pianist [[Ahmad Jamal]], whose elegant approach and use of space influenced him deeply</span>
				<span class='text'>He also definitively severed his stylistic ties with bebop</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;&quot;Back in bebop, everybody used to play real fast</span>
				<span class='text'>But I didn't ever like playing a bunch of scales and shit</span>
				<span class='text'>I always tried to play the most important notes in the chord, to break it up</span>
				<span class='text'>I used to hear all them musicians playing all them scales and notes and never nothing you could remember</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; [[#Bio|''The Autobiography'']]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In 1951, Davis met [[Bob Weinstock]], the owner of [[Prestige Records]], and signed a contract with the label</span>
				<span class='text'>Between 1951 and 1954, he released many records on Prestige, with several different combos</span>
				<span class='text'>While the personnel of the recordings varied, the lineup often featured [[Sonny Rollins]] and [[Art Blakey]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Davis was particularly fond of Rollins and tried several times, in the years that preceded his meeting with [[John Coltrane]], to recruit him for a regular group</span>
				<span class='text'>He never succeeded, however, mostly because Rollins was prone to make himself unavailable for months at a time</span>
				<span class='text'>In spite of the casual occasions that generated these recordings, their quality is almost always quite high, and they document the evolution of Davis' style and sound</span>
				<span class='text'>During this time he began using the [[Harmon mute]], held close to the [[microphone]], in a way that became his signature, and his phrasing, especially in [[ballad]]s, became spacious, melodic, and relaxed</span>
				<span class='text'>This sound became so characteristic that the use of the Harmon mute by any jazz trumpet player since immediately conjures up Miles Davis</span>
				<span class='text'>he most important Prestige recordings of this period (''[[Dig (Miles Davis album)|Dig]]'', ''[[Blue Haze]]'', ''[[Bags' Groove]]'', ''[[Miles Davis and the Modern Jazz Giants]]'', and ''[[Walkin']]'') originated mostly from recording sessions in 1951 and 1954, after Davis' recovery from his addiction</span>
				<span class='text'>Also of importance are his five [[Blue Note Records|Blue Note]] recordings, collected in the ''[[Miles Davis Volume 1]]'' album</span>
				<span class='text'>ith these recordings, Davis assumed a central position in what is known as [[hard bop]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In contrast with bebop, hard bop used slower tempos and a less radical approach to harmony and melody, often adopting popular tunes and standards from the American songbook as starting points for improvisation</span>
				<span class='text'>Hard bop also distanced itself from cool jazz by virtue of a harder beat and by its constant reference to the [[blues]], both in its traditional form and in the form made popular by [[rhythm and blues]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Open references to the blues in jazz playing were fairly recent</span>
				<span class='text'>Until the middle of the 1930s, as [[Coleman Hawkins]] declared to [[Alan Lomax]] (''The Land Where the Blues Began</span>
				<span class='text'>' New York: Pantheon, 1993), African American players working in white establishments would avoid references to the blues altogether</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; A few critics&lt;ref name=&quot;KAHN2001&quot;/&gt; go as far as to call ''Walkin''' the album that created hard bop, but the point is debatable, given the number of musicians who were working along similar lines at the same time (many of whom recorded or played with Davis)</span>
				<span class='text'>n this period, Davis gained a reputation for being distant, cold, and withdrawn, and for having a quick temper</span>
				<span class='text'>Factors that contributed to this reputation included his contempt for the critics and specialized press, and some well-publicized confrontations with the public and with fellow musicians</span>
				<span class='text'> near fight with [[Thelonious Monk]] during the recording of ''Bags' Groove'', received wide exposure in the specialized press</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Davis had asked Monk to &quot;lay off&quot; (stop playing) while he was soloing</span>
				<span class='text'>In the autobiography, Davis says that Monk &quot;could not play behind a horn</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; [[Charles Mingus]] reported this, and more, in his &quot;Open Letter to Miles Davis&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Davis had an operation to remove polyps from his larynx in October 1955</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Even though he was not supposed to speak at all for ten days, he had an argument with somebody and raised his voice</span>
				<span class='text'>This outburst damaged his vocal cords forever, giving him the characteristic raspy voice that came to be associated with him</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;[</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> in February or March 1956, that I had my first throat operation and had to disband the group while recovering</span>
				<span class='text'>During the course of the conversation I raised my voice to make a point and fucked up my voice</span>
				<span class='text'>I wasn't even supposed to talk for at least ten days, and here I was not only talking, but talking loudly</span>
				<span class='text'>After that incident my voice had this whisper that has been with me ever since</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;abio&quot;/&gt;The &quot;nocturnal&quot; quality of Davis' playing and his somber reputation, along with his whispering voice,&lt;ref&gt;Acquired by shouting at a record producer while still ailing after a recent operation to the throat – [[#Bio|''The Autobiography'']]&lt;/ref&gt; earned him the lasting moniker of &quot;prince of darkness&quot;, adding a patina of mystery to his public persona</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Davis began to be referred to as &quot;the Prince of Darkness&quot; in liner notes of the records of this period, and the moniker persists to this day; see, for instance, [http://findarticles</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===First great quintet and sextet (1955–58)==={{Main|Miles Davis Quintet}}Back in New York City and in better health, in 1955 Davis attended the [[Newport Jazz Festival]], where his performance (and especially his solo on &quot;[['Round Midnight (song)|'Round Midnight]]&quot;) was greatly admired and prompted the critics to hail the &quot;return of Miles Davis&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time, Davis recruited the players for a formation that became known as his &quot;first great quintet&quot;: [[John Coltrane]] on tenor saxophone, [[Red Garland]] on piano, [[Paul Chambers]] on bass, and [[Philly Joe Jones]] on drums</span>
				<span class='text'>one of these musicians, with the exception of Davis, had received a great deal of exposure before that time; Chambers, in particular, was very young (19 at the time), a Detroit player who had been on the New York City scene for only about a year, working with the bands of [[Bennie Green]], [[Paul Quinichette]], [[George Wallington]], [[J</span>
				<span class='text'>J</span>
				<span class='text'>Johnson]], and [[Kai Winding]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Coltrane was little known at the time, in spite of earlier collaborations with [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Earl Bostic]], and [[Johnny Hodges]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Davis hired Coltrane as a replacement for Sonny Rollins, after unsuccessfully trying to recruit alto saxophonist [[Cannonball Adderley|Julian &quot;Cannonball&quot; Adderley]]</span>
				<span class='text'>he repertoire included many bebop mainstays, [[jazz standard|standards]] from the [[Great American Songbook]] and the pre-bop era, and some traditional tunes</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Some inspired by Ahmad Jamal: see, for instance, the performance of &quot;Billy Boy&quot; on ''[[Milestones (Miles Davis album)|Milestones]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The prevailing style of the group was a development of the Davis experience in the previous years—Davis playing long, [[legato]], and essentially melodic lines, while Coltrane, who during these years emerged as a leading figure on the musical scene, contrasted by playing high-energy solos</span>
				<span class='text'>ith the new formation also came a new recording contract</span>
				<span class='text'>In [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], [[Rhode Island]], Davis had met [[Columbia Records]] producer [[George Avakian]], who persuaded him to sign with his label</span>
				<span class='text'>The quintet made its debut on record with the extremely well received ''[['Round About Midnight]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Before leaving Prestige, however, Davis had to fulfill his obligations during two days of recording sessions in 1956</span>
				<span class='text'>Prestige released these recordings in the following years as four albums: ''[[Relaxin' with the Miles Davis Quintet]]'', ''[[Steamin' with the Miles Davis Quintet]]'', ''[[Workin' with the Miles Davis Quintet]]'', and ''[[Cookin' with the Miles Davis Quintet]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>While the recording took place in a studio, each record of this series has the structure and feel of a live performance, with several first takes on each album</span>
				<span class='text'>The records became almost instant classics and were instrumental in establishing Davis' quintet as one of the best on the jazz scene</span>
				<span class='text'>he quintet was disbanded for the first time in 1957, following a series of personal problems that Davis blames on the drug addiction of the other musicians</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Especially Jones and Coltrane, whom Davis both fired</span>
				<span class='text'>Davis&amp;nbsp;– [[#Bio|''The Autobiography'']]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Davis played some gigs at the ''Cafe Bohemia'' with a short-lived formation that included Sonny Rollins and drummer [[Art Taylor]], and then traveled to France, where he recorded the score to [[Louis Malle]]'s film ''[[Elevator to the Gallows|Ascenseur pour l'échafaud]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>With the aid of French session musicians [[Barney Wilen]], [[Pierre Michelot]], and [[René Urtreger]], and expatriate American drummer [[Kenny Clarke]], he recorded the entire soundtrack with an innovative procedure, without relying on written material: starting from sparse indication of the harmony and a general feel of a given piece, the group played by watching the movie on a screen in front of them and improvising</span>
				<span class='text'> performance of [[Les Ballets Africains]] from [[Guinea]] in 1958 sparked Davis's interest in modal music</span>
				<span class='text'>This music, featuring the [[kalimba]], stayed for long periods of time on a single chord, weaving in and out of consonance and dissonance</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[Early, Gerald Lyn]] (2001) [https://books</span>
				<span class='text'>oogle</span>
				<span class='text'>om/books?id=rlK4Rre5FekC&amp;pg=PA89 ''Miles Davis and American Culture''], Missouri History Museum, ISBN 978-1-883982-38-6</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; It was a very new concept in jazz at the time, then dominated by the chord-change based music of bebop</span>
				<span class='text'>eturning to New York City in 1958, Davis successfully recruited Cannonball Adderley for his standing group</span>
				<span class='text'>Coltrane, who in the meantime had freed himself from his drug habits, was available after a highly fruitful experience with Thelonious Monk and was hired back, as was Philly Joe Jones</span>
				<span class='text'>With the quintet re-formed as a sextet, Davis recorded ''[[Milestones (Miles Davis album)|Milestones]]'', an album anticipating the new directions he was preparing to give to his music</span>
				<span class='text'>lmost immediately after the recording of ''Milestones,'' Davis fired Garland and, shortly afterward, Jones, again for behavioral problems; he replaced them with [[Bill Evans]]—a young white pianist with a strong classical background—and drummer [[Jimmy Cobb]]</span>
				<span class='text'>With this revamped formation, Davis began a year during which the sextet performed and toured extensively and produced a record (''[[1958 Miles]]'', also known as ''58 Sessions'')</span>
				<span class='text'>Evans had a unique, impressionistic approach to the piano, and his musical ideas had a strong influence on Davis</span>
				<span class='text'>But after only eight months on the road with the group, he was burned out and left</span>
				<span class='text'>He was soon replaced by [[Wynton Kelly]], a player who brought to the sextet a [[Swing (jazz performance style)|swinging]], bluesy approach that contrasted with Evans' more delicate playing</span>
				<span class='text'>==Recordings with Gil Evans (1957–63)===In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Davis recorded a series of albums with [[Gil Evans]], often playing [[flugelhorn]] as well as trumpet</span>
				<span class='text'>The first, ''[[Miles Ahead]]'' (1957), showcased his playing with a jazz [[big band]] and a horn section arranged by Evans</span>
				<span class='text'>Songs included [[Dave Brubeck]]'s &quot;The Duke,&quot; as well as [[Léo Delibes]]'s &quot;The Maids of Cadiz,&quot; the first piece of [[European classical music]] Davis had recorded</span>
				<span class='text'>Another distinctive feature of the album was the orchestral passages that Evans had devised as transitions between the different tracks, which were joined together with the innovative use of [[editing]] in the post-production phase, turning each side of the album into a seamless piece of music</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cook, op</span>
				<span class='text'>cit</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In 1958, Davis and Evans were back in the studio to record ''[[Porgy and Bess (Miles Davis album)|Porgy and Bess]]'', an arrangement of pieces from [[George Gershwin]]'s [[Porgy and Bess|opera of the same name]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The lineup included three members of the sextet: Paul Chambers, Philly Joe Jones, and Julian &quot;Cannonball&quot; Adderley</span>
				<span class='text'>Davis called the album one of his favorites</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===''Kind of Blue'' (1959–64)===In March and April 1959, Davis re-entered the studio with his working sextet to record what is widely considered his ''[[magnum opus]]'', ''[[Kind of Blue]]</span>
				<span class='text'>' He called back Bill Evans, months away from forming what would become his own [[Bill Evans#Trio with Scott LaFaro and Paul Motian|seminal trio]], for the album sessions, as the music had been planned around Evans' piano style</span>

				<span class='text'>The resulting album has proven both highly popular and enormously influential</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Davis persuaded Coltrane to play with the group on one final European tour in the spring of 1960</span>
				<span class='text'>Coltrane then departed to form his classic quartet, although he returned for some of the tracks on Davis' 1961 album ''[[Someday My Prince Will Come (Miles Davis album)|Someday My Prince Will Come]]</span>
				<span class='text'>' After Coltrane, Davis tried various saxophonists, including [[Jimmy Heath]], [[Sonny Stitt]], and [[Hank Mobley]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The quintet with Hank Mobley was recorded in the studio and on several live engagements at [[Carnegie Hall]] and the [[Black Hawk (nightclub)|Black Hawk jazz club]] in [[San Francisco]]</span>

				<span class='text'>n 1963, Davis' longtime rhythm section of Kelly, Chambers, and Cobb departed</span>
				<span class='text'>He quickly got to work putting together a new group, including [[tenor saxophone|tenor saxophonist]] [[George Coleman]] and bassist [[Ron Carter]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Davis, Coleman, Carter and a few other musicians recorded half the tracks for an album in the spring of 1963</span>
				<span class='text'>A few weeks later, seventeen-year-old drummer [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]] and pianist [[Herbie Hancock]] joined the group, and soon afterward Davis, Coleman, and the new rhythm section recorded the rest of ''[[Seven Steps to Heaven (album)|Seven Steps to Heaven]]</span>
				<span class='text'>'The rhythm players melded together quickly as a section and with the horns</span>
				<span class='text'>The group's rapid evolution can be traced through the ''[[Seven Steps to Heaven]]'' album, ''In Europe'' (July 1963), ''[[My Funny Valentine (album)|My Funny Valentine]]'' (February 1964), and ''Four and More'' (also February 1964)</span>
				<span class='text'>The quintet played essentially the same repertoire of bebop tunes and standards that earlier Davis bands had played, but they tackled them with increasing structural and rhythmic freedom and, in the case of the up-tempo material, breakneck speed</span>

				<span class='text'>Rivers remained in the group only briefly, but was recorded live with the quintet in [[Japan]]; this configuration can be heard on ''Miles in Tokyo!'' (July 1964)</span>
				<span class='text'>y the end of the summer, Davis had persuaded [[Wayne Shorter]] to leave [[Art Blakey]]'s Jazz Messengers and join the quintet</span>
				<span class='text'>Shorter became the group's principal composer, and some of his compositions of this era (including &quot;Footprints&quot; and &quot;Nefertiti&quot;) have become [[Jazz standard|standards]]</span>

				<span class='text'>The quintet's approach to improvisation came to be known as &quot;time no changes&quot; or &quot;freebop,&quot; because they abandoned the more conventional [[chord progression|chord-change]]-based approach of bebop for a modal approach</span>
				<span class='text'>Through ''Nefertiti,'' the studio recordings consisted primarily of originals composed by Shorter, with occasional compositions by the other sidemen</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1967, the group began to play their live concerts in continuous sets, each tune flowing into the next, with only the melody indicating any sort of demarcation</span>
				<span class='text'>Davis's bands would continue to perform in this way until his retirement in 1975</span>
				<span class='text'>'Miles in the Sky'' and ''Filles de Kilimanjaro,''—which tentatively introduced electric bass, electric piano, and electric guitar on some tracks—pointed the way to the subsequent [[jazz fusion|fusion]] phase of Davis's career</span>

				<span class='text'>This album and ''In a Silent Way'' were among the first fusions of jazz and rock that were commercially successful, building on the groundwork laid by [[Charles Lloyd (jazz musician)|Charles Lloyd]], [[Larry Coryell]], and others who pioneered a genre that would become known as [[jazz fusion]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Notably, the album included &quot;He Loved Him Madly&quot;, a tribute to [[Duke Ellington]], as well as one of Davis's most lauded pieces from this era, &quot;Calypso Frelimo&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>It was his last studio album of the 1970s</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1974 and 1975, Columbia recorded three double-LP live Davis albums: ''[[Dark Magus]]'', ''[[Agharta (album)|Agharta]]'', and ''[[Pangaea (album)|Pangaea]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>All three feature at least two electric guitarists (Reggie Lucas and Pete Cosey, deploying an array of Hendrix-inspired electronic distortion devices; [[Dominique Gaumont]] is a third guitarist on ''Dark Magus''), electric bass, drums, reeds, and Davis on electric trumpet and organ</span>
				<span class='text'>These albums were the last he recorded for five years</span>
				<span class='text'>Davis was troubled by osteoarthritis (which led to a hip replacement operation in 1976, the first of several), [[sickle-cell anemia]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[bursitis]], [[Peptic ulcer|ulcers]], and a renewed dependence on [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] and [[drug]]s (primarily [[cocaine]]), and his performances were routinely panned by critics throughout late 1974 and early 1975</span>
				<span class='text'>By the time the group reached Japan in February 1975, Davis was nearing a physical breakdown and required copious amounts of alcohol and narcotics to make it through his engagements</span>

				<span class='text'>quot; {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} In his memoirs, Davis is characteristically candid about his wayward mental state during this period, describing himself as a hermit, his [[Upper West Side]] apartment as a wreck, and detailing his drug and [[Sexual addiction|sex]] addictions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;abio&quot;/&gt; In 1976, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' reported rumors of his imminent demise</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he stopped practicing trumpet on a regular basis, Davis continued to compose intermittently and made three attempts at recording during his self-imposed exile from performing; these sessions (one with the assistance of Paul Buckmaster and Gil Evans, who left after not receiving promised compensation) bore little fruit and remain unreleased</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1979, he placed in the yearly top-ten trumpeter poll of ''[[Down Beat]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Columbia continued to issue [[compilation album]]s and records of unreleased vault material to fulfill contractual obligations</span>
				<span class='text'>During his period of inactivity, Davis saw the fusion music that he had spearheaded over the past decade enter into the mainstream</span>
				<span class='text'>When he emerged from retirement, Davis's musical descendants—most notably [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]—would be in the realm of [[New wave music|new wave]] rock</span>
				<span class='text'>==Later years and death===[[File:Miles Davis and Cicely Tyson 1982</span>

				<span class='text'>As he had not played trumpet for the better part of three years, regaining his famed [[embouchure]] proved particularly toilsome</span>
				<span class='text'>While recording ''[[The Man with the Horn]]'' at a leisurely pace throughout 1980–1981, Davis played mostly [[Wah-wah (music)#Wah-wah in trumpet and trombone playing|wahwah]] with a younger, larger band</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Miles Davis 22</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Miles Davis at the [[North Sea Jazz Festival]] in 1991]]The initial large band was eventually abandoned in favor of a smaller combo featuring saxophonist [[Bill Evans (saxophonist)|Bill Evans]] (not to be confused with pianist Bill Evans of the 1958–59 sextet), and bass player [[Marcus Miller]], both of whom would be among Davis's most regular collaborators throughout the decade</span>
				<span class='text'>He married Tyson in 1981; they would divorce in 1988</span>
				<span class='text'>''The Man with the Horn'' was finally released in 1981 and received a poor critical reception despite selling fairly well</span>
				<span class='text'>In May, the new band played two dates as part of the Newport Jazz Festival</span>
				<span class='text'>The concerts, as well as the live recording ''[[We Want Miles]]'' from the ensuing tour, received positive reviews</span>
				<span class='text'>y late 1982, Davis's band included French percussionist [[Mino Cinelu]] and guitarist [[John Scofield]], with whom he worked closely on the album ''[[Star People]]</span>
				<span class='text'>' In mid-1983, while working on the tracks for ''[[Decoy (album)|Decoy]]'', an album mixing [[soul music]] and [[electronica]] that was released in 1984, Davis brought in producer, composer and keyboardist [[Robert Irving III]], who had earlier collaborated with him on ''The Man with the Horn</span>
				<span class='text'>' With a seven-piece band, including Scofield, Evans, keyboardist and music director Irving, drummer [[Al Foster]] and bassist [[Darryl Jones]] (later of [[the Rolling Stones]]), Davis played a series of European gigs to positive receptions</span>
				<span class='text'>While in Europe, he took part in the recording of ''[[Aura (Miles Davis album)|Aura]]'', an orchestral tribute to Davis composed by Danish trumpeter [[Palle Mikkelborg]]</span>
				<span class='text'>'[[You're Under Arrest (Miles Davis album)|You're Under Arrest]]'', Davis' next album, was released in 1985 and included another brief stylistic detour</span>
				<span class='text'>Included on the album were his interpretations of [[Cyndi Lauper]]'s ballad &quot;[[Time After Time (Cyndi Lauper song)|Time After Time]]&quot;, and [[Michael Jackson]]'s pop hit &quot;[[Human Nature (Michael Jackson song)|Human Nature]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Davis considered releasing an entire album of pop songs and recorded dozens of them, but the idea was scrapped</span>
				<span class='text'>Davis noted that many of today's accepted jazz standards were in fact pop songs from [[Broadway theater]], and that he was simply updating the &quot;standards&quot; repertoire with new material</span>
				<span class='text'>1985 also saw Davis guest-star on the TV show ''[[Miami Vice]]'' as [[pimp]] and minor criminal Ivory Jones in the episode titled &quot;Junk Love&quot; (first aired November 8, 1985)</span>

				<span class='text'>Trumpeter [[Wynton Marsalis]] publicly dismissed Davis' more recent fusion recordings as not being &quot;'true' jazz,&quot; comments Davis initially shrugged off, calling Marsalis &quot;a nice young man, only confused</span>
