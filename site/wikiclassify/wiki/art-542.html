				<span class='text'>His paintings include [[Portraits by Vincent van Gogh|portraits]], [[Self-portraits by Vincent van Gogh|self portraits]], landscapes, still lifes of [[cypress]]es, [[Wheat Fields (Van Gogh series)|wheat fields]], and [[sunflowers (series of paintings)|sunflowers]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Van Gogh was born to upper middle class parents and spent his early adulthood working for a firm of art dealers before traveling to The Hague, London and Paris, after which he taught in England at [[Isleworth]] and [[Ramsgate]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He drew as a child but did not paint until his late twenties; most of his best-known works were completed during the last two years of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>In just over a decade, he produced more than 2,100 artworks, including 860 oil paintings and more than 1,300 watercolors, drawings, sketches and prints</span>
				<span class='text'>He was deeply religious as a younger man and aspired to be a pastor</span>
				<span class='text'>From 1879 he worked as a missionary in a mining region in Belgium where he sketched people from the local community, and in 1885 painted his first major work ''[[The Potato Eaters]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>His palette then consisted mainly of somber earth tones and showed no sign of the vivid coloration that distinguished his later paintings</span>
				<span class='text'>In March 1886, he moved to Paris and discovered the [[Impressionism|French Impressionists]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Later, he moved to the south of France and was influenced by the region's strong sunlight</span>
				<span class='text'>His paintings grew brighter in color, and he developed the unique and highly recognizable style that became fully realized during his stay in [[Arles]] in 1888</span>
				<span class='text'>fter years of anxiety and frequent bouts of mental illness he died aged 37 from a self-inflicted gunshot wound</span>
				<span class='text'>The extent to which his mental health affected his painting has been widely debated</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite a widespread tendency to romanticize his ill health, art historians see an artist deeply frustrated by the inactivity and incoherence wrought through illness</span>
				<span class='text'>His late paintings show an artist at the height of his abilities, completely in control, and according to art critic [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]], &quot;longing for concision and grace&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Though Theo kept a stock of Impressionist paintings in his gallery on Boulevard Montmartre (by artists including [[Claude Monet]], [[Alfred Sisley]], [[Edgar Degas]], and [[Camille Pissarro]]), Van Gogh seemingly had problems acknowledging developments in how artists view and paint their subject matter</span>

				<span class='text'>At the end of 1886, Theo found that living with Vincent was &quot;almost unbearable&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>By the spring of 1887, they were again at peace, although Van Gogh moved to [[Asnières-sur-Seine|Asnières]], a northwestern suburb of Paris, where he became acquainted with Signac</span>
				<span class='text'>With [[Émile Bernard]], he&lt;!-- Signac or VG? --&gt; adopted elements of [[Pointillism]], a technique in which a multitude of small colored dots are applied to the canvas such that—when seen from a distance—they create an optical blend of hues</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;H143&quot; /&gt; He arrived on 21 February 1888 and took a room at the Hôtel-Restaurant Carrel, which he had idealistically expected to look like one of [[Hokusai]] (1760–1849) or [[Utamaro]]'s (1753–1806) prints</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;H144&quot; /&gt; Van Gogh was enchanted by the local landscape and light and his works from this period are richly draped in yellow, [[ultramarine]], and [[mauve]]</span>

				<span class='text'>That March, he painted local landscapes using a gridded &quot;perspective frame&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Three of these paintings were shown at the annual exhibition of the [[Société des Artistes Indépendants]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Van Heugten (1996), 246–51&lt;/ref&gt; When he committed to art as an adult, he began at an elementary level, copying the ''Cours de dessin'', a drawing course edited by [[Charles Bargue]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Within two years he sought commissions</span>
				<span class='text'>In spring 1882, his uncle, Cornelis Marinus, owner of a well-known gallery of contemporary art in Amsterdam, asked him for drawings of the Hague</span>
				<span class='text'>Van Gogh's work did not live up to his uncle's expectations</span>
				<span class='text'>Marinus offered a second commission, this time specifying the subject matter in detail, but was once again disappointed with the result</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, Van Gogh persevered</span>
				<span class='text'>He improved the lighting of his studio by installing variable shutters and experimented with a variety of drawing materials</span>
				<span class='text'>For more than a year he worked on single figures – highly elaborated studies in &quot;Black and White&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Artists working in ''Black &amp; White'', i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> for illustrated papers like ''The Graphic'' or ''Illustrated London News'' were among Van Gogh's favorites</span>
				<span class='text'>See Pickvance (1974/75)&lt;/ref&gt; which at the time gained him only criticism</span>

				<span class='text'>In the sky, there is a bright star with a large intense yellow halo around it]]Early in 1883, he began to work on multi-figure compositions, which he based on his drawings</span>
				<span class='text'>He had some of them photographed, but when his brother remarked that they lacked liveliness and freshness, he destroyed them and turned to oil painting</span>
				<span class='text'>By Autumn 1882, his brother had enabled him financially to turn out his first paintings, but all the money Theo could supply was soon spent</span>
				<span class='text'>Then, in spring 1883, Van Gogh turned to renowned [[Hague School]] artists like [[Johan Hendrik Weissenbruch|Weissenbruch]] and [[Bernard Blommers|Blommers]], and received technical support from them, as well as from painters like [[Théophile de Bock|De Bock]] and [[Herman Johannes van der Weele|Van der Weele]], both second generation Hague School artists</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;DSS&quot;&gt;See Dorn, Schröder &amp; Sillevis, ed</span>
				<span class='text'>(1996)&lt;/ref&gt; When he moved to Nuenen after the intermezzo in Drenthe he began several large-sized paintings but destroyed most of them</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[The Potato Eaters]]'' and its companion pieces – ''The Old Tower'' on the Nuenen cemetery and ''The Cottage'' – are the only ones to have survived</span>
				<span class='text'>Following a visit to the [[Rijksmuseum]], Van Gogh was aware that many of his faults were due to lack of technical experience</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;DSS&quot;/&gt; So in November 1885 he traveled to [[Antwerp]] and later to Paris to learn and develop his skill</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See Welsh-Ovcharov &amp; Cachin (1988)&lt;!-- page(s)?? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;After becoming familiar with Impressionist and Neo-Impressionist techniques and theories, Van Gogh went to Arles to develop on these new possibilities</span>
				<span class='text'>But within a short time, older ideas on art and work reappeared: ideas such as working with [[serial imagery]] on related or contrasting subject matter, which would reflect on the purposes of art</span>
				<span class='text'>As his work progressed, he painted many ''[[Self-portraits by Vincent van Gogh|Self-portraits]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Already in 1884 in Nuenen he had worked on a series that was to decorate the dining room of a friend in Eindhoven</span>
				<span class='text'>Similarly in Arles, in spring 1888 he arranged his ''[[Flowering Orchards (Van Gogh series)|Flowering Orchards]]'' into triptychs, began a series of figures that found its end in ''[[The Roulin Family (Van Gogh series)|The Roulin Family series]]'', and finally, when Gauguin had consented to work and live in Arles side-by-side with Van Gogh, he started to work on ''[[The Décoration for the Yellow House|The Décorations for the Yellow House]]'', which was by some accounts the most ambitious effort he ever undertook</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;d1909&quot;&gt;See Dorn (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; Most of his later work is involved with elaborating on or revising its fundamental settings</span>
				<span class='text'>In the spring of 1889, he painted another, smaller group of orchards</span>
				<span class='text'>In an April letter to Theo, he said, &quot;I have 6 studies of Spring, two of them large orchards</span>
				<span class='text'>There is little time because these effects are so short-lived</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;H385&quot;&gt;Hulsker (1980), 385&lt;/ref&gt;Art historian [[Albert Boime]] believes that Van Gogh – even in seemingly fantastical compositions like ''Starry Night'' – based his work in reality</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Boime (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[White House at Night]]'', shows a house at twilight with a prominent star surrounded by a yellow halo in the sky</span>
				<span class='text'>Astronomers at [[Southwest Texas State University]] in San Marcos calculated that the star is Venus, which was bright in the evening sky in June 1890 when Van Gogh is believed to have painted the picture</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;At around 8:00&amp;nbsp;pm on 16 June 1890, as astronomers determined by [[Venus]]'s position in the painting</span>
