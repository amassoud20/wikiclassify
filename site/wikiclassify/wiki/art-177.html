				<span class='text'>[[Museo del Prado]]]]'''Francisco José de Goya y Lucientes'''{{efn-ua|The paternal family name is Goya, the second or maternal family name is Lucientes}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|ɔɪ|ə}}; {{IPA-es|fɾanˈθisko xoˈse ðe ˈɣoʝa i luˈθjentes|lang}} (30 March 1746 – 16 April 1828) was a Spanish [[Romanticism|romantic]] painter and [[Printmaking|printmaker]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He is considered the most important Spanish artist of late 18th and early 19th centuries and throughout his long career was a commentator and chronicler of his era</span>
				<span class='text'>Immensely successful in his lifetime, Goya is often referred to as both the last of the [[Old Master]]s and the first of the moderns</span>
				<span class='text'>e was born to a modest family in 1746 in the village of [[Fuendetodos]] in [[Aragon]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He studied painting from age 14 under [[José Luzán|José Lúzan y Martinez]] and moved to Madrid to study with [[Anton Raphael Mengs]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He married [[Josefa Bayeu]] in 1775; the couple's  life together was characterised by an almost constant series of pregnancies and miscarriages</span>
				<span class='text'>He became a court painter to the [[Spanish Crown]] in 1786 and the early portion of his career is marked by portraits commissioned by the Spanish aristocracy and royalty, as well as the [[Rococo]] style [[List of Francisco Goya's tapestry cartoons|tapestry cartoons]] designed for the royal palace</span>
				<span class='text'>oya was a guarded man and although letters and writings survive, we know comparatively little about his thoughts</span>
				<span class='text'>He suffered a severe and undiagnosed illness in 1793 which left him completely deaf</span>
				<span class='text'>After 1793 his work became progressively darker and pessimistic</span>
				<span class='text'>His later easel and mural paintings, prints and drawings appear to reflect a bleak outlook on personal, social and political levels, and contrast with his social climbing</span>
				<span class='text'>He was appointed ''Director of the Royal Academy'' in 1795, the year [[Manuel Godoy]] made an unfavorable treaty with France</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1799 Goya became ''Primer Pintor de Càmara'', the then highest rank for a Spanish court painter</span>
				<span class='text'>In the late 1790s, commissioned by Godoy, he completed his ''[[La maja desnuda]]'', a remarkably daring nude for the time and clearly indebted to [[Diego Velázquez]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1801 he painted ''[[Charles IV of Spain and His Family]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1807 [[Napoleon]] led the French army into Spain</span>
				<span class='text'>e remained in Madrid during the [[Peninsular War]], which seems to have affected him deeply</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he did not vocalise his thoughts in public, they can be inferred from his &quot;[[The Disasters of War|Disasters of War]]&quot; series of prints (although published 35 years after his death) and his 1814 paintings ''[[The Second of May 1808]]'' and ''[[The Third of May 1808]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Other works from his mid period include the &quot;[[Los Caprichos|Caprichos]]&quot; and ''[[Los Disparates]]'' etching series, and a wide variety of paintings concerned with [[Yard with Lunatics|insanity]], [[The Madhouse|mental asylums]], [[Witches' Flight|witches]], [[The Bewitched Man|fantastical creatures]] and [[The Inquisition Tribunal|religious]] and [[The Junta of the Philippines|political]] corruption, all of which suggest that he feared for both his country's fate and his own mental and physical health</span>
				<span class='text'>His output culminates with the so-called &quot;[[Black Paintings]]&quot; of 1819-1823, applied on oil on the plaster walls of his house the &quot;[[Quinta del Sordo]]&quot; (''house of the deaf man'') where, disillusioned by domestic political and social developments he lived in near isolation</span>
				<span class='text'>Goya eventually abandoned Spain in 1824 to retire to the French city of [[Bordeaux]], accompanied by his much younger maid and companion, [[La Leocadia|Leocadia Weiss]], who may or may not have been his lover</span>
				<span class='text'>There he completed his &quot;[[La Tauromaquia]]&quot; series and a number of canvases</span>
				<span class='text'>Following a stroke which left him paralysed on his right side, and suffering failing eyesight and poor access to painting materials, he died and was buried on 16 April 1828 aged 82</span>
				<span class='text'>His body was later re-interred in Spain</span>

				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|220px|Birth house of Francisco Goya, Fuendetodos, Zaragoza]]Francisco Goya was born in [[Fuendetodos]], [[Aragón]], Spain, on 30 March 1746 to José Benito de Goya y Franque and Gracia de Lucientes y Salvador</span>
				<span class='text'>The family had moved that year from the city of [[Zaragoza]], but there is no record why; likely José was commissioned to work there</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;h32&quot;&gt;Hughes (2004), 32&lt;/ref&gt; They were lower middle-class, José was the son of a [[notary]] and of [[Basque people|Basque]] origin, earning his living as a [[gilding|gilder]], specialising in religious and decorative craftwork</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Connell (2004), 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; He oversaw the gilding and most of the ornamentation during the rebuilding of the [[Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar]] (''Santa Maria del Pilar''), the principal cathedral of Zaragoza</span>
				<span class='text'>Francisco was their fourth child, following his sister Rita (b</span>
				<span class='text'>1737), brother Tomás (b</span>
				<span class='text'>1739) (who was to follow in his father's trade) and second sister Jacinta (b</span>
				<span class='text'>1743)</span>
				<span class='text'>There were two later sons, Mariano (b</span>
				<span class='text'>1750) and Camilo (b</span>
				<span class='text'>1753)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;h27&quot;&gt;Hughes (2004), 27&lt;/ref&gt;His mother's family had pretensions of nobility and the house, a modest brick cottage, was owned by her family and, perhaps fancifully, bore their [[family crest|crest]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;c6&quot;&gt;Connell (2004), 6&lt;/ref&gt; About 1749 José and Gracia bought a home in Zaragoza and were able to return to live in the city</span>
				<span class='text'>Although there are no surviving records it is thought that Goya may have attended the Escuelas Pías de San Antón, which offered free schooling</span>
				<span class='text'>His education seems to have been adequate but not enlightening; he had reading, writing and numeracy, and some knowledge of the classics</span>
				<span class='text'>According to art Critic Robert Hughes the artist &quot;seems to have taken no more interest than a carpenter in philosophical or theological matters, and his views on painting </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>were very down to earth: Goya was no theoretician</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;h33&quot;&gt;Hughes (2004), 33&lt;/ref&gt;  At school he formed a close and lifelong friendship with fellow pupil Martin Zapater; the 131 letters Goya wrote to him from 1775 until Zapater's death in 1801 give valuable insight into Goya's early years at the court in Madrid</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Connell (2004), 14&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to Madrid where he studied with [[Anton Raphael Mengs]], a painter who was popular with [[Spain|Spanish]] royalty</span>
				<span class='text'>He clashed with his master, and his examinations were unsatisfactory</span>
				<span class='text'>Goya submitted entries for the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando]] in 1763 and 1766, but was denied entrance</span>

				<span class='text'>Having failed to earn a scholarship, Goya relocated at his own expense to Rome in the old tradition of European artists stretching back to at least to [[Albrecht Dürer]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;h34&quot;&gt;Hughes (2004), 34&lt;/ref&gt; He was an unknown at the time and so the records are scant and uncertain</span>
				<span class='text'>Early biographers have him travelling to Rome with a gang of bullfighters, where he worked as a street [[acrobat]], or for a Russian diplomat, or fell in love with beautiful young nun whom he plotted to abduct from her convent</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|150px|''Portrait of Josefa Bayeu'' (1747-1812)]]In 1771 he won second prize in a painting competition organized by the City of [[Parma]]</span>
				<span class='text'>That year he returned to Saragossa and painted parts of the cupolas of the [[Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar|Basilica of the Pillar]] (including ''[[Adoration of the Name of God]]''), a [[Frescoes in the Cartuja de Aula Dei|cycle of frescoes]] in the monastic church of the [[Charterhouse of Aula Dei]], and the frescoes of the Sobradiel Palace</span>
				<span class='text'>He studied with the Aragónese artist [[Francisco Bayeu y Subías]] and his painting began to show signs of the delicate tonalities for which he became famous</span>
				<span class='text'>oya befriended Francisco Bayeu, and married Bayeu's sister [[Josefa Bayeu|Josefa]] (he nicknamed her &quot;Pepa&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;Baticle (1994), 74&lt;/ref&gt; on 25 July 1773 and they had their first child, Antonio Juan Ramon y Carlos, on 29 August 1774</span>

				<span class='text'>Over five years he designed some 42 patterns, many of which were used to decorate and insulate the stone walls of [[El Escorial]] and the [[Royal Palace of El Pardo|Palacio Real del Pardo]], the residences of the Spanish monarchs</span>
				<span class='text'>While designing tapestries was neither prestigious nor well paid, his cartoons are  mostly popularist in a [[rococo]] style, and Goya used them to bring himself to wider attention</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hagen &amp; Hagen, 7&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Goya - The Garroted Man</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|140px|''The Garroted Man'', before 1780</span>
				<span class='text'>[[National Gallery of Art]], [[Washington, D</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>]]]The cartoons were not his only royal commissions, and were accompanied by a series of engravings, mostly copies after old masters such as [[Marcantonio Raimondi]] and Velázquez</span>
				<span class='text'>Goya had a complicated relationship to the latter artist; while many of his contemporaries saw folly in Goya's attempts to copy and emulate him, he had access to a wide range of the long dead painter's works that had been contained in the royal collection</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hughes (2004), 95&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, etching was to become a medium that the young artist was to master, a medium that was to reveal both the true depths of his imagination and his political beliefs</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hagen; Hagen (1999), 7&lt;/ref&gt; His c 1779 etching of ''[[The Garrotted Man]]'' (&quot;El agarrotado&quot;) was the largest work he had produced to date, and an obvious foreboding of his later &quot;[[The Disasters of War|Disasters of War]]&quot; series</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hughes (2004), 96&lt;/ref&gt;Goya was beset by illness and his condition was used against him by the contemporary art scene, which looked jealously upon any artist seen to be rising in stature</span>
				<span class='text'>Some of the larger cartoons, such as ''The Wedding'', were more than 8 by 10 feet, and had proved a drain on his physical strength</span>
				<span class='text'>Ever resourceful, Goya turned this misfortune around, claiming that his illness had allowed him the insight to produce works that were more personal and informal</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hughes (2004), 130&lt;/ref&gt; However, he found the format limiting, it did not allow him capture complex colour shift or texture, and was unsuited to the [[impasto]] and [[Glaze (painting technique)|glazing]] techniques he was by then applying to his painted works</span>
				<span class='text'>The tapestries seems as comments on human types, fashion and fads</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hughes (2004), 83&lt;/ref&gt;Other works from the period include a canvas for the altar of the [[San Francisco el Grande Basilica, Madrid|Church of San Francisco El Grande]] in Madrid, which led to his appointment as a member of the Royal Academy of Fine Art</span>

				<span class='text'>He also became friends with [[Infante Luis, Count of Chinchón|Crown Prince Don Luis]], and spent two summers with him, painting portraits of both the Infante and his family</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1786, Goya was given a salaried position as painter to Charles III</span>

				<span class='text'>The following year he became First Court Painter with a salary of 50,000 [[Spanish real|reales]] and an allowance of 500 [[ducat]]s for a coach</span>
				<span class='text'>He painted the King and the Queen, royal family pictures, a portrait of the Spanish Prime Minister [[Manuel de Godoy]] and many other nobles</span>
				<span class='text'>His portraits are notable for their disinclination to flatter, and in the case of ''[[Charles IV of Spain and His Family]]'', the lack of visual diplomacy is remarkable</span>

				<span class='text'>Under his reign his wife [[Maria Luisa of Parma|Louisa]] was thought to have had the real power, and thus Goya placed her at the center of the group portrait</span>
				<span class='text'>From the back left of the painting one can see the artist himself looking out at the viewer, and the painting behind the family depicts [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]] and his daughters, thus once again echoing the underlying message of corruption and decay</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1801 he painted  Godoy in a commission to commemorate the victory in the brief [[War of the Oranges]] against Portugal</span>
				<span class='text'>The two were friends, even if Goya's ''[[Portrait of Manuel Godoy|1801 portrait]]'' is usually seen as satire</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet even after Godoy's fall from grace the politician referred to the artist in warm terms</span>
				<span class='text'>Godoy saw himself as instrumental in the publication of the Caprichos and is widely believed to have commissioned ''[[La maja desnuda]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;Although he did not make known his intention when creating the aquatint plates of the ''The Disasters of War'' in the 1810s, art historians view them as a visual protest against the violence of the 1808 [[Dos de Mayo Uprising]], the subsequent Peninsular War and the setbacks to the liberal cause following the [[Bourbon Restoration|restoration of the Bourbon monarchy]] in 1814</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Connell (2004), 28&lt;/ref&gt;Not much is known about her beyond her fiery temperament</span>

				<span class='text'>She had two children before the marriage dissolved, and bore a third, Rosario, in 1814 when she was 26</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hughes (2004), 372&lt;/ref&gt; There has been much speculation that Goya and Weiss were romantically linked, however, it is more likely the affection between them was sentimental</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Junquera, 68&lt;/ref&gt;Leocadia was left nothing in Goya's will; mistresses were often omitted in such circumstances, but it is also likely that he did not want to dwell on his mortality by thinking about or revising his will</span>
