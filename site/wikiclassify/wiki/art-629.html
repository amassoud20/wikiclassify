				<span class='text'>His studies of mechanical and optical systems led him to discover new mathematical concepts and techniques</span>
				<span class='text'>His best known contribution to mathematical physics is the reformulation of [[Newtonian mechanics]], now called [[Hamiltonian mechanics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This work has proven central to the modern study of classical field theories such as [[electromagnetism]], and to the development of [[quantum mechanics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In pure mathematics, he is best known as the inventor of [[quaternion]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>amilton is said to have shown immense talent at a very early age</span>
				<span class='text'>Astronomer Bishop Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>[[John Brinkley (astronomer)|John Brinkley]] remarked of the 18-year-old Hamilton, 'This young man, I do not say ''will be'', but ''is'', the first mathematician of his age</span>
				<span class='text'>== Life ==William Rowan Hamilton's scientific career included the study of [[geometrical optics]], [[classical mechanics]], adaptation of dynamic methods in optical systems, applying quaternion and vector methods to problems in mechanics and in geometry, development of theories of conjugate algebraic couple functions (in which complex numbers are constructed as ordered pairs of real numbers), solvability of polynomial equations and general quintic polynomial solvable by radicals, the analysis on Fluctuating Functions (and the ideas from [[Fourier analysis]]), linear operators on quaternions and proving a result for linear operators on the space of quaternions (which is a special case of the general theorem which today is known as the ''[[Cayley–Hamilton theorem]]'')</span>
				<span class='text'>Hamilton also invented &quot;''[[icosian calculus]]''&quot;, which he used to investigate closed edge paths on a dodecahedron that visit each vertex exactly once</span>
				<span class='text'>==Early life===Hamilton was the fourth of nine children born to Sarah Hutton (1780–1817) and Archibald Hamilton (1778–1819), who lived in [[Dublin]] at 38 Dominick Street</span>
				<span class='text'>Hamilton's father, who was from [[Dunboyne]], worked as a solicitor</span>
				<span class='text'>By the age of three, Hamilton had been sent to live with his uncle James Hamilton, a graduate of [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]] who ran a school in Talbots Castle in [[Trim, County Meath|Trim]] Co</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; His uncle soon discovered that Hamilton had a remarkable ability to learn languages, and from a young age, had displayed an uncanny ability to acquire them (although this is disputed by some historians, who claim he had only a very basic understanding of them)</span>
				<span class='text'>At the age of seven he had already made very considerable progress in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and before he was thirteen he had acquired, under the care of his uncle (a linguist), almost as many languages as he had years of age</span>
				<span class='text'>These included the classical and modern European languages, and [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], [[Sanskrit]], and even [[Marathi language|Marathi]] and [[Malay language|Malay]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He retained much of his knowledge of languages to the end of his life, often reading Persian and Arabic in his spare time, although he had long stopped studying languages, and used them just for relaxation</span>
				<span class='text'>n September 1813 the American calculating prodigy [[Zerah Colburn (math prodigy)|Zerah Colburn]] was being exhibited in Dublin</span>
				<span class='text'>Colburn was 9, a year older than Hamilton</span>
				<span class='text'>The two were pitted against each other in a mental arithmetic contest with Colburn emerging the clear victor</span>
				<span class='text'>In reaction to his defeat, Hamilton dedicated less time to studying languages and more time to studying mathematics</span>

				<span class='text'>tml }}&lt;/ref&gt;Hamilton was part of a small but well-regarded school of mathematicians associated with [[Trinity College, Dublin]], which he entered at age 18</span>
				<span class='text'>He studied both classics and mathematics, and was appointed Professor of [[Astronomy]] in 1827, prior to his graduation taking up residence at Dunsink Observatory where he spent the rest of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=mactutor/&gt;===Optics and Mechanics==={{Classical mechanics|Topic=Scientists}}Hamilton made important contributions to [[optics]] and to [[classical mechanics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His first discovery was in an early paper that he communicated in 1823 to Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Brinkley, who presented it under the title of &quot;''Caustics''&quot; in 1824 to the [[Royal Irish Academy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It was referred as usual to a committee</span>
				<span class='text'>While their report acknowledged its novelty and value, they recommended further development and simplification before publication</span>
				<span class='text'>Between 1825 and 1828 the paper grew to an immense size, mostly by the additional details which the committee had suggested</span>
				<span class='text'>But it also became more intelligible, and the features of the new method were now easily to be seen</span>
				<span class='text'>Until this period Hamilton himself seems not to have fully understood either the nature or importance of optics, as later he intended to apply his method to dynamics</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1827, Hamilton presented a theory of a single function, now known as [[Hamilton's principal function]], that brings together mechanics, optics, and mathematics, and which helped to establish the wave theory of light</span>
				<span class='text'>He proposed for it when he first predicted its existence in the third supplement to his &quot;''Systems of Rays', read in 1832</span>
				<span class='text'>The Royal Irish Academy paper was finally entitled &quot;[http://www</span>
				<span class='text'>aths</span>
				<span class='text'>cd</span>
				<span class='text'>e/pub/HistMath/People/Hamilton/Rays/ ''Theory of Systems of Rays''],&quot; (23 April 1827) and the first part was printed in 1828 in the ''Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy''</span>
				<span class='text'>The more important contents of the second and third parts appeared in the three voluminous supplements (to the first part) which were published in the same Transactions, and in the two papers &quot;[http://www</span>
				<span class='text'>aths</span>
				<span class='text'>cd</span>
				<span class='text'>e/pub/HistMath/People/Hamilton/Dynamics/ ''On a General Method in Dynamics''],&quot; which appeared in the Philosophical Transactions in 1834 and 1835</span>
				<span class='text'>In these papers, Hamilton developed his great principle of &quot;''Varying Action''&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The most remarkable result of this work is the prediction that a single ray of light entering a biaxial crystal at a certain angle would emerge as a hollow cone of rays</span>
				<span class='text'>This discovery is still known by its original name, &quot;''[[conical refraction]]''&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>he step from optics to dynamics in the application of the method of &quot;''Varying Action''&quot; was made in 1827, and communicated to the Royal Society, in whose ''[[Philosophical Transactions]]'' for 1834 and 1835 there are two papers on the subject, which, like the &quot;''Systems of Rays'',&quot; display a mastery over symbols and a flow of mathematical language almost unequaled</span>
				<span class='text'>The common thread running through all this work is Hamilton's principle of &quot;''Varying Action''&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Although it is based on the [[calculus of variations]] and may be said to belong to the general class of problems included under the [[principle of least action]] which had been studied earlier by [[Maupertuis|Pierre Louis Maupertuis]], [[Euler]], [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]], and others, Hamilton's analysis revealed much deeper mathematical structure than had been previously understood, in particular the symmetry between momentum and position</span>
				<span class='text'>Paradoxically, the credit for discovering the quantity now called the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] and [[Lagrange's equations]] belongs to Hamilton</span>
				<span class='text'>Hamilton's advances enlarged greatly the class of mechanical problems that could be solved, and they represent perhaps the greatest addition which [[Analytical dynamics|dynamics]] had received since the work of [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Lagrange]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Many scientists, including [[Joseph Liouville|Liouville]], [[C</span>
				<span class='text'>G</span>
				<span class='text'>J</span>
				<span class='text'>Jacobi|Jacobi]], [[Jean Gaston Darboux|Darboux]], [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]], [[Kolmogorov]], and [[V</span>
				<span class='text'>I</span>
				<span class='text'>Arnold|Arnold]], have extended Hamilton's work, thereby expanding our knowledge of [[mechanics]] and [[differential equations]]</span>
				<span class='text'>hile Hamilton's reformulation of classical mechanics is based on the same physical principles as the mechanics of Newton and Lagrange, it provides a powerful new technique for working with the equations of motion</span>
				<span class='text'>More importantly, both the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] and [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] approaches which were initially developed to describe the motion of [[discrete system]]s, have proven critical to the study of continuous classical systems in physics, and even quantum mechanical systems</span>
				<span class='text'>In this way, the techniques find use in [[electromagnetism]], [[quantum mechanics]], [[Quantum field theory|quantum]] [[relativity theory]], and [[quantum field theory]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==Mathematical studies==={{refimprove section|date=April 2013}}Hamilton's [[mathematics|mathematical]] studies seem to have been undertaken and carried to their full development without any assistance whatsoever, and the result is that his writings do not belong to any particular &quot;''school''&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Not only was Hamilton an expert as an [[arithmetic]] calculator, but he seems to have occasionally had fun in working out the result of some calculation to an enormous number of decimal places</span>
				<span class='text'>At the age of eight Hamilton engaged [[Zerah Colburn (math prodigy)|Zerah Colburn]], the American &quot;''[[mental calculator|calculating boy]]''&quot;, who was then being exhibited as a curiosity in Dublin</span>
				<span class='text'>Two years later, aged ten, Hamilton stumbled across a [[Latin]] copy of [[Euclid]], which he eagerly devoured; and at twelve he studied [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s ''[[Arithmetica Universalis]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>This was his introduction to modern [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Hamilton soon began to read the ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'', and at sixteen Hamilton had mastered a great part of it, as well as some more modern works on [[analytical geometry]] and the [[differential calculus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>round this time Hamilton was also preparing to enter [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]], Dublin, and therefore had to devote some time to classics</span>
				<span class='text'>In mid-1822 he began a systematic study of [[Laplace]]'s ''[[Celestial mechanics|Mécanique Céleste]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>rom that time Hamilton appears to have devoted himself almost wholly to mathematics, though he always kept himself well acquainted with the [[History of science and technology|progress of science]] both in Britain and abroad</span>
				<span class='text'>Hamilton found an important defect in one of Laplace's demonstrations, and he was induced by a friend to write out his remarks, so that they could be shown to Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>[[John Brinkley (astronomer)|John Brinkley]], then the first [[Royal Astronomer of Ireland]], and an accomplished mathematician</span>
				<span class='text'>Brinkley seems to have immediately perceived Hamilton's talents, and to have encouraged him in the kindest way</span>
				<span class='text'>amilton's career at College was perhaps unexampled</span>
				<span class='text'>Amongst a number of extraordinary competitors, he was first in every subject and at every examination</span>
				<span class='text'>He achieved the rare distinction of obtaining an [[optime]] both for [[Greek language|Greek]] and for [[physics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Hamilton might have attained many more such honours (he was expected to win both the [[gold medal]]s at the degree examination), if his career as a student had not been cut short by an unprecedented event</span>
				<span class='text'>This was Hamilton's appointment to the [[Andrews Professorship of Astronomy]] in the [[University of Dublin]], vacated by Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Brinkley in 1827</span>
				<span class='text'>The chair was not exactly offered to him, as has been sometimes asserted, but the electors, having met and talked over the subject, authorised Hamilton's personal friend (also an elector) to urge Hamilton to become a candidate, a step which Hamilton's modesty had prevented him from taking</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, when barely 22, Hamilton was established at the [[Dunsink Observatory]], near Dublin</span>
				<span class='text'>amilton was not especially suited for the post, because although he had a profound acquaintance with [[theoretical astronomy]], he had paid little attention to the regular work of the practical [[astronomer]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Hamilton's time was better employed in original investigations than it would have been spent in observations made even with the best of instruments</span>
				<span class='text'>Hamilton was intended by the university authorities who elected him to the professorship of astronomy to spend his time as he best could for the advancement of science, without being tied down to any particular branch</span>
				<span class='text'>If Hamilton had devoted himself to practical astronomy, the University of Dublin would assuredly have furnished him with instruments and an adequate staff of assistants</span>

				<span class='text'>Other honours rapidly succeeded, among which his election in 1837 to the president's chair in the [[Royal Irish Academy]], and the rare distinction of being made a corresponding member of the [[Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences]]</span>

				<span class='text'>He failed to find a useful 3-dimensional system (in modern terminology, he failed to find a real, three-dimensional [[skew-field]]), but in working with four dimensions he created quaternions</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Hamilton, on 16 October he was out walking along the [[Royal Canal]] in Dublin with his wife when the solution in the form of the equation:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1&lt;/math&gt;suddenly occurred to him; Hamilton then promptly carved this equation using his penknife into the side of the nearby [[Broom Bridge]] (which Hamilton called Brougham Bridge)</span>

				<span class='text'>Bulletin 65 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;The quaternion involved abandoning [[commutativity]], a radical step for the time</span>
				<span class='text'>Not only this, but Hamilton had in a sense invented the cross and dot products of vector algebra</span>
				<span class='text'>Hamilton also described a quaternion as an ordered four-element multiple of real numbers, and described the first element as the 'scalar' part, and the remaining three as the 'vector' part</span>
				<span class='text'>amilton introduced, as a method of analysis, both quaternions and [[biquaternion]]s, the extension to eight dimensions by introduction of complex number [[coefficient]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>When his work was assembled in 1853, the book ''Lectures on Quaternions'' had &quot;formed the subject of successive courses of lectures, delivered in 1848 and subsequent years, in the Halls of Trinity College, Dublin&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Hamilton confidently declared that quaternions would be found to have a powerful influence as an instrument of research</span>
				<span class='text'>When he died, Hamilton was working on a definitive statement of quaternion science</span>
				<span class='text'>His son William Edwin Hamilton brought the ''Elements of Quaternions'', a hefty volume of 762 pages, to publication in 1866</span>
				<span class='text'>As copies ran short, a second edition was prepared by [[Charles Jasper Joly]], when the book was split into two volumes, the first appearing 1899 and the second in 1901</span>
				<span class='text'>The subject index and footnotes in this second edition improved the ''Elements'' accessibility</span>
				<span class='text'>[Peter Guthrie Tait]] among others, advocated the use of Hamilton's quaternions</span>
				<span class='text'> They were made a mandatory examination topic in Dublin, and for a while they were the only advanced mathematics taught in some Americanuniversities</span>
				<span class='text'> However, controversy about the use of quaternions grew in the late 19th century</span>
				<span class='text'>Some of Hamilton's supporters vociferously opposed the growing fields of vector algebra and vector calculus (from developers like [[Oliver Heaviside]] and [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]]), because quaternions provide superior notation</span>
				<span class='text'>While this is undeniable for four dimensions, quaternions cannot be used with arbitrary dimensionality (though extensions like [[Clifford algebra]]s can)</span>
				<span class='text'>Vector notation had largely replaced the &quot;''[[space-time]]''&quot; quaternions in science and engineering by the mid-20th century</span>
				<span class='text'>oday, the quaternions are used in [[computer graphics]], [[control theory]], [[signal processing]], and orbital mechanics, mainly for representing rotations/orientations</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, it is common for spacecraft attitude-control systems to be commanded in terms of quaternions, which are also used to telemeter their current attitude</span>
				<span class='text'>The rationale is that combining many quaternion transformations is more numerically stable than combining many matrix transformations</span>
				<span class='text'> In pure mathematics, quaternions show up significantly as one of the four finite-dimensional [[normed division algebra]]s over the real numbers, with applications throughout algebra and geometry</span>
				<span class='text'>==Other originality==={{unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}Hamilton originally matured his ideas before putting pen to paper</span>
				<span class='text'>The discoveries, papers, and treatises previously mentioned might well have formed the whole work of a long and laborious life</span>
				<span class='text'>But not to speak of his enormous collection of books, full to overflowing with new and original matter, which have been handed over to [[Trinity College, Dublin]], the previous mentioned works barely form the greater portion of what Hamilton has published</span>
				<span class='text'>Hamilton developed the [[variational principle]], which was reformulated later by [[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also introduced the [[icosian game]] or ''Hamilton's puzzle'' which can be solved using the concept of a [[Hamiltonian path]]</span>
				<span class='text'>amilton's extraordinary investigations connected with the solution of algebraic equations of the [[quintic function|fifth degree]], and his examination of the results arrived at by [[Niels Henrik Abel|N</span>
				<span class='text'>H</span>
				<span class='text'>Abel]], [[George Birch Jerrard|G</span>
				<span class='text'>B</span>
				<span class='text'>Jerrard]], and others in their researches on this subject, form another contribution to science</span>
				<span class='text'>There is next Hamilton's paper on [[fluctuating function]]s, a subject which, since the time of [[Joseph Fourier]], has been of immense and ever increasing value in physical [[applications of mathematics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>There is also the extremely ingenious invention of the [[hodograph]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Of his extensive investigations into the solutions (especially by [[numerical approximation]]) of certain classes of physical differential equations, only a few items have been published, at intervals, in the ''[[Philosophical Magazine]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>esides all this, Hamilton was a voluminous correspondent</span>
				<span class='text'>Often a single letter of Hamilton's occupied from fifty to a hundred or more closely written pages, all devoted to the minute consideration of every feature of some particular problem; for it was one of the peculiar characteristics of Hamilton's mind never to be satisfied with a general understanding of a question; Hamilton pursued the problem until he knew it in all its details</span>
				<span class='text'>Hamilton was ever courteous and kind in answering applications for assistance in the study of his works, even when his compliance must have cost him much time</span>
				<span class='text'>He was excessively precise and hard to please with reference to the final polish of his own works for publication; and it was probably for this reason that he published so little compared with the extent of his investigations</span>
