				<span class='text'>Aristotle says that on the subject of reasoning he had nothing else on an earlier date to speak of</span>
				<span class='text'> However Plato reports that  was devised before him by  who was concerned by the correct use of words</span>
				<span class='text'>Logic seems to have emerged from  the earlier philosophers made frequent use of concepts like  in their discussions but never truly understood the logical implications</span>
				<span class='text'>Even Plato had difficulties with logic although he had a reasonable conception of a  he could never actually construct one thus he relied instead on his </span>
				<span class='text'>name Bocheński 1951Bocheński 1951</span>
				<span class='text'>Plato believed that deduction would simply follow from s hence he focused on maintaining solid premises so that the  would logically follow</span>
				<span class='text'>Consequently Plato realized that a method for obtaining conclusions would be most beneficial</span>
				<span class='text'>He never succeeded in devising such a method but his best attempt was published in his book  where he introduced his division method</span>
				<span class='text'> What we today call Aristotelian logic Aristotle himself would have labeled analytics</span>
				<span class='text'>The term logic he reserved to mean dialectics</span>
				<span class='text'>Most of Aristotles work is probably not in its original form because it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers</span>
				<span class='text'>The logical works of Aristotle were compiled into six books in about the early 1st century CE#Categories#On Interpretation#Prior Analytics#Posterior Analytics#Topics#On Sophistical RefutationsThe order of the books or the teachings from which they are composed is not certain but this list was derived from analysis of Aristotles writings</span>
				<span class='text'>It goes from the basics the analysis of simple terms in the Categories the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in On Interpretation to the study of more complex forms namely syllogisms in the Analytics and dialectics in the Topics and Sophistical Refutations</span>
				<span class='text'>The first three treatises form the core of the logical theory stricto sensu the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning</span>
				<span class='text'>There is one volume of Aristotles concerning logic not found in the Organon namely the fourth book of Metaphysics</span>
				<span class='text'>name Bocheński 1951 Like his teacher Plato Aristotles philosophy aims at the </span>
				<span class='text'>Aristotles  however finds the universal in  things which he calls the essence of things while in Platos ontology the universal exists apart from particular things and is related to them as their  or </span>
				<span class='text'>For Aristotle theore  is based on the study of particular phenomena and rises to the knowledge of essences while for Plato epistemology begins with knowledge of universal  or ideas and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these</span>
				<span class='text'>For Aristotle form still ers to the unconditional basis of  but is instantiated in a particular substance see  below</span>
				<span class='text'>In a certain sense Aristotles method is both  and  while Platos is essentially deductive from  principles</span>
				<span class='text'>In Aristotles terminology natural philosophy is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics biology and other natural sciences</span>
				<span class='text'>In modern times the scope of philosophy has become limited to more generic or abstract inquiries such as ethics and metaphysics in which logic plays a major role</span>
				<span class='text'>Todays philosophy tends to exclude empirical study of the natural world by means of the scientific method</span>
				<span class='text'>In contrast Aristotles philosophical endeavors encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry</span>
				<span class='text'>n the larger sense of the word Aristotle makes philosophy coextensive with reasoning which he also would describe as science</span>
				<span class='text'>Note however that his use of the term science carries a different meaning than that covered by the term scientific method</span>
				<span class='text'>For Aristotle all science dianoia is either practical poetical or theoretical Metaphysics 1025b25</span>
				<span class='text'>By practical science he means ethics and politics by poetical science he means the study of poetry and the other fine arts by theoretical science he means physics mathematics and metaphysics</span>
				<span class='text'>f logic or analytics is regarded as a study preliminary to philosophy the divisions of Aristotelian philosophy would consist of 1  2 Theoretical Philosophy including Metaphysics Physics and Mathematics 3 Practical Philosophy and 4 Poetical Philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>n the period between his two stays in Athens between his times at the Academy and the Lyceum Aristotle conducted most of the scientific thinking and research for which he is renowned today</span>
				<span class='text'>In fact most of Aristotles life was devoted to the study of the objects of natural science</span>
				<span class='text'>Aristotles metaphysics contains observations on the nature of numbers but he made no original contributions to mathematics</span>
				<span class='text'>He did however perform  in the natural sciences e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>botany zoology physics astronomy chemistry meteorology and several other sciences</span>
				<span class='text'>ristotles writings on science are largely qualitative as opposed to quantitative</span>
				<span class='text'>Beginning in the 16th century scientists began applying mathematics to the physical sciences and Aristotles work in this area was deemed hopelessly inadequate</span>
				<span class='text'>His failings were largely due to the absence of concepts like mass velocity force and temperature</span>
				<span class='text'>He had a conception of speed and temperature but no quantitative understanding of them which was partly due to the absence of basic experimental devices like clocks and thermometers</span>
				<span class='text'>is writings provide an account of many scientific observations a mixture of precocious accuracy and curious errors</span>
				<span class='text'>For example in his  he claimed that human males have more teeth than females</span>
				<span class='text'>ristotle History of Animals 2</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> In a similar vein  and later  showed by simple experiments that Aristotles theory that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect</span>
				<span class='text'> On the other hand Aristotle uted s claim that the  was made up of those stars which are shaded by the earth from the suns rays pointing out correctly even if such reasoning was bound to be dismissed for a long time that given current astronomical demonstrations that the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun thenampnbsp</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them</span>

				<span class='text'>In places Aristotle goes too far in deriving laws of the universe from simple observation and over stretched </span>
				<span class='text'>Todays scientific method assumes that such thinking without sufficient facts is ineffective and that discerning the validity of ones hypothesis requires far more rigorous experimentation than that which Aristotle used to support his laws</span>
				<span class='text'>ristotle also had some scientific blind spots</span>
				<span class='text'>He posited a  that we may discern in selections of the Metaphysics which was widely accepted up until the 16th century</span>
				<span class='text'>From the 3rd century to the 16th century the dominant view held that the Earth was the rotational </span>
				<span class='text'>ecause he was perhaps the philosopher most respected by European thinkers during and after the Renaissance these thinkers often took Aristotles erroneous positions as given which held back science in this epoch</span>
				<span class='text'>1928</span>
				<span class='text'>Platonism Berkeley University of California Press pp</span>
				<span class='text'>61 103–104</span>
				<span class='text'> However Aristotles scientific shortcomings should not mislead one into forgetting his great advances in the many scientific fields</span>
				<span class='text'>For instance he founded logic as a formal science and created foundations to biology that were not superseded for two millennia</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover he introduced the fundamental notion that nature is composed of things that change and that studying such changes can provide useful knowledge of underlying constants</span>
				<span class='text'>s quoted from  blockquoteHe Aristotle ers to many examples of changes now constantly going on and insists emphatically on the great results which they must produce in the lapse of ages</span>
				<span class='text'>He instances particular cases of lakes that had dried up and deserts that had at length become watered by rivers and fertilized</span>
				<span class='text'>He points to the growth of the Nilotic delta since the time of Homer to the shallowing of the  within sixty years from his own timeampnbsp</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>He alludesampnbsp</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>to the upheaving of one of the Eolian islands previous to a volcanic eruption</span>
				<span class='text'>The changes of the earth he says are so slow in comparison to the duration of our lives that they are overlooked and the migrations of people after great catastrophes and their removal to other regions cause the event to be forgotten</span>
				<span class='text'>e says 12th chapter of his Meteorics the distribution of land and sea in particular regions does not endure throughout all time but it becomes sea in those parts where it was land and again it becomes land where it was sea and there is reason for thinking that these changes take place according to a certain system and within a certain period</span>
				<span class='text'>The concluding observation is as follows As time never fails and the universe is eternal neither the Tanais nor the Nile can have flowed for ever</span>
				<span class='text'>The places where they rise were once dry and there is a limit to their operations but there is none to time</span>
				<span class='text'>So also of all other rivers they spring up and they perish and the sea also continually deserts some lands and invades others The same tracts theore of the earth are not some always sea and others always continents but every thing changes in the course of time</span>

				<span class='text'>All that is earthly tends toward the center of the universe i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>the center of the Earth</span>
				<span class='text'>Water tends toward a sphere surrounding the center</span>
				<span class='text'>Air tends toward a sphere surrounding the water sphere</span>
				<span class='text'>Fire tends toward the lunar sphere in which the Moon orbits</span>
				<span class='text'>When elements are moved out of their natural place they naturally move back towards it</span>
				<span class='text'>This is natural motion—motion requiring no extrinsic cause</span>
				<span class='text'>So for example in water earthy bodies sink while air bubbles rise up in air rain falls and flame rises</span>
				<span class='text'>Outside all the other spheres the heavenly fifth element manifested in the stars and planets moves in the perfection of circles</span>
				<span class='text'>Aristotle defined  as the actuality of a potentiality as such</span>
				<span class='text'>hysics 201a10–11 201a27–29 201b4–5  Aquinas suggested that the passage be understood literally that motion can indeed be understood as the active fulfillment of a potential as a transition toward a potentially possible state</span>
				<span class='text'>Because  are normally opposites in Aristotle other commentators either suggest that the wording which has come down to us is erroneous or that the addition of the as such to the definition is critical to understanding it</span>
				<span class='text'>    Linked from  and  see   Aristotle suggested that the reason for anything coming about can be attributed to four different types of simultaneously active causal factors describes the material out of which something is composed</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus the material cause of a table is wood and the material cause of a car is rubber and steel</span>
				<span class='text'>It is not about action</span>
				<span class='text'>It does not mean one domino knocks over another domino</span>
				<span class='text'>he  is its form i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>the arrangement of that matter</span>
				<span class='text'>It tells us what a thing is that any thing is determined by the definition form pattern essence whole synthesis or archetype</span>
				<span class='text'>It embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws as the whole i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>macrostructure is the cause of its parts a relationship known as the whole part causation</span>
				<span class='text'>Plainly put the formal cause is the idea existing in the first place as exemplar in the mind of the sculptor and in the second place as intrinsic determining cause embodied in the matter</span>
				<span class='text'>Formal cause could only er to the essential quality of causation</span>
				<span class='text'>A simple example of the formal cause is the mental image or idea that allows an artist architect or engineer to create his drawings</span>
				<span class='text'>he  is the primary source or that from which the change under consideration proceeds</span>
				<span class='text'>It identifies what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is changed and so suggests all sorts of agents nonliving or living acting as the sources of change or movement or rest</span>
				<span class='text'>Representing the current understanding of causality as the relation of cause and effect this covers the modern definitions of cause as either the agent or agency or particular events or states of affairs</span>
				<span class='text'>So take the two dominoes this time of equal weighting the first is knocked over causing the second also to fall over</span>
				<span class='text'>he  is its purpose or that for the sake of which a thing exists or is done including both purposeful and instrumental actions and activities</span>
				<span class='text'>The final cause or teleos is the purpose or function that something is supposed to serve</span>
				<span class='text'>This covers modern ideas of motivating causes such as volition need desire ethics or spiritual beliefs</span>
				<span class='text'>dditionally things can be causes of one another causing each other reciprocally as hard work causes fitness and vice versa although not in the same way or function the one is as the beginning of change the other as the goal</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus Aristotle first suggested a reciprocal or circular causality as a relation of mutual dependence or influence of cause upon effect</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover Aristotle indicated that the same thing can be the cause of contrary effects its presence and absence may result in different outcomes</span>
				<span class='text'>Simply it is the goal or purpose that brings about an event</span>
				<span class='text'>Our two dominoes require someone or something to intentionally knock over the first domino because it cannot fall of its own accord</span>
				<span class='text'>ristotle marked two modes of causation proper prior causation and accidental chance causation</span>
				<span class='text'>All causes proper and incidental can be spoken as potential or as actual particular or generic</span>
				<span class='text'>The same language ers to the effects of causes so that generic effects assigned to generic causes particular effects to particular causes operating causes to actual effects</span>
				<span class='text'>Essentially causality does not suggest a temporal relation between the cause and the effect</span>
				<span class='text'>Aristotle held more accurate theories on some optical concepts than other philosophers of his day</span>
				<span class='text'>The second oldest written evidence of a  after  c</span>
				<span class='text'>400 BC can be found in Aristotles documentation of such a device in 350ampnbspBC in Problemata</span>
				<span class='text'>Aristotles apparatus contained a dark chamber that had a single small hole or  to allow for sunlight to enter</span>
				<span class='text'>Aristotle used the device to make observations of the sun and noted that no matter what shape the hole was the sun would still be correctly displayed as a round object</span>
				<span class='text'>In modern cameras this is analogous to the </span>
				<span class='text'>Aristotle also made the observation that when the distance between the aperture and the surface with the image increased the image was magnified</span>
				<span class='text'> According to Aristotle spontaneity and chance are causes of some things distinguishable from other types of cause</span>
				<span class='text'>Chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of </span>
				<span class='text'>It is from what is spontaneous but note that what is spontaneous does not come from chance</span>
				<span class='text'>For a better understanding of Aristotles conception of chance it might be better to think of coincidence Something takes place by chance if a person sets out with the intent of having one thing take place but with the result of another thing not intended taking place</span>
				<span class='text'>or example A person seeks donations</span>
				<span class='text'>That person may find another person willing to donate a substantial sum</span>
				<span class='text'>However if the person seeking the donations met the person donating not for the purpose of collecting donations but for some other purpose Aristotle would call the collecting of the donation by that particular donator a result of chance</span>
				<span class='text'>It must be unusual that something happens by chance</span>
				<span class='text'>In other words if something happens all or most of the time we cannot say that it is by chance</span>
				<span class='text'>here is also more specific kind of chance which Aristotle names luck that can only apply to human beings because it is in the sphere of moral actions</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Aristotle luck must involve choice and thus deliberation and only humans are capable of deliberation and choice</span>
				<span class='text'>What is not capable of action cannot do anything by chance</span>
				<span class='text'>ristotle Physics 2</span>
				<span class='text'> Aristotle defines metaphysics as the knowledge of  being or of being in the highest degree of </span>
				<span class='text'>He ers to metaphysics as first philosophy as well as the theologic science</span>
				<span class='text'>Aristotle examines the concepts of  and  ousia in his Metaphysics Book VII and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form</span>
				<span class='text'>In book VIII he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the  or the stuff of which it is composed</span>
				<span class='text'>For example the matter of a house is the bricks stones timbers etc</span>
				<span class='text'>or whatever constitutes the potential house while the form of the substance is the actual house namely covering for bodies and chattels or any other  see also  that let us define something as a house</span>
				<span class='text'>The formula that gives the components is the account of the matter and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form</span>
				<span class='text'>ristotle Metaphysics VIII 1043a 10–30 With regard to the change  and its causes now as he defines in his  and  319b–320a he distinguishes the coming to be from# growth and diminution which is change in quantity# locomotion which is change in space and# alteration which is change in quality</span>
				<span class='text'>he coming to be is a change where nothing persists of which the resultant is a property</span>
				<span class='text'>In that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality  and actuality  in association with the matter and the form</span>
				<span class='text'>eferring to potentiality this is what a thing is capable of doing or being acted upon if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else</span>
				<span class='text'>For example the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially dynamei plant and if is not prevented by something it will become a plant</span>
				<span class='text'>Potentially beings can either act poiein or be acted upon paschein which can be either innate or learned</span>
				<span class='text'>For example the eyes possess the potentiality of sight innateampnbsp– being acted upon while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning exerciseampnbsp– acting</span>
				<span class='text'>ctuality is the fulfillment of the end of the potentiality</span>
				<span class='text'>Because the end telos is the principle of every change and for the sake of the end exists potentiality theore actuality is the end</span>
				<span class='text'>Referring then to our previous example we could say that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do</span>
				<span class='text'>lockquoteFor that for the sake of which a thing is is its principle and the becoming is for the sake of the end and the actuality is the end and it is for the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired</span>
				<span class='text'>For animals do not see in order that they may have sight but they have sight that they may see</span>
				<span class='text'>ristotle Metaphysics IX 1050a 5–10  blockquoteIn summary the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities which is also a  or end</span>
				<span class='text'>Then Aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula in time and in substantiality</span>
				<span class='text'>ith this  of the particular substance i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>matter and form Aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings for example what is it that makes a man one Since according to Plato there are two Ideas animal and biped how then is man a unity However according to Aristotle the potential being matter and the actual one form are one and the same thing</span>
				<span class='text'>ristotle Metaphysics VIII 1045a–b  Aristotles predecessor Plato argued that all things have a universal form which could be either a property or a relation to other things</span>
				<span class='text'>When we look at an apple for example we see an apple and we can also analyze a form of an apple</span>
				<span class='text'>In this distinction there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover we can place an apple next to a book so that we can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other</span>
				<span class='text'>lato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things</span>
				<span class='text'>For example it is possible that there is no particular good in existence but good is still a proper universal form</span>
				<span class='text'> is a 20th century philosopher who agreed with Plato on the existence of uninstantiated universals</span>
				<span class='text'>ristotle disagreed with Plato on this point arguing that all universals are instantiated</span>
				<span class='text'>Aristotle argued that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Aristotle if a universal exists either as a particular or a relation then there must have been must be currently or must be in the future something on which the universal can be predicated</span>
				<span class='text'>Consequently according to Aristotle if it is not the case that some universal can be predicated to an object that exists at some period of time then it does not exist</span>
				<span class='text'>n addition Aristotle disagreed with Plato about the location of universals</span>
				<span class='text'>As Plato spoke of the world of the forms a location where all universal forms subsist Aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated</span>
				<span class='text'>So according to Aristotle the form of apple exists within each apple rather than in the world of the forms</span>
				<span class='text'>n Aristotelian science especially in biology things he saw himself have stood the test of time better than his retelling of the reports of others which contain error and superstition</span>
				<span class='text'>He dissected animals but not humans his ideas on how the human body works have been almost entirely superseded</span>
				<span class='text'>Aristotle is the earliest natural historian whose work has survived in some detail</span>
				<span class='text'>Aristotle certainly did research on the natural history of  and the surrounding seas and neighbouring areas</span>
				<span class='text'>The works that lect this research such as   and  contain some observations and interpretations along with sundry myths and mistakes</span>
				<span class='text'>The most striking passages are about the sea life visible from observation on Lesbos and available from the catches of fishermen</span>
				<span class='text'>His observations on    and angler fish are detailed as is his writing on s namely Octopus Sepia  and the paper nautilus </span>
				<span class='text'>His description of the  used in sexual reproduction was widely disbelieved until its rediscovery in the 19th century</span>
				<span class='text'>He separated the aquatic mammals from fish and knew that sharks and rays were part of the group he called Selachē </span>

				<span class='text'>Oxford 1931</span>
				<span class='text'>Another good example of his methods comes from the Generation of Animals in which Aristotle describes breaking open fertilized chicken eggs at intervals to observe when visible organs were generated</span>
				<span class='text'>e gave accurate descriptions of s four chambered fore stomachs and of the  embryological development of the  </span>

				<span class='text'> Aristotle distinguished about 500 species of birds mammals and fishes</span>
				<span class='text'>name BergstromDugatkin2012  name Rhodes1974  His classification of living things contains some elements which still existed in the 19th century</span>
				<span class='text'>What the modern zoologist would call vertebrates and invertebrates Aristotle called animals with blood and animals without blood he did not know that complex invertebrates do make use of  but of a different kind from vertebrates</span>
				<span class='text'>Animals with blood were divided into live bearing mammals and egg bearing birds and fish</span>
				<span class='text'>Invertebrates animals without blood are insects crustacea divided into non shelled – cephalopods – and shelled and testacea molluscs</span>
				<span class='text'>In some respects this incomplete classification is better than that of  who crowded the invertebrata together into two groups Insecta and Vermes worms</span>
				<span class='text'>or  Nothing is more remarkable than Aristotles efforts to exhibit the relationships of living things as a scala naturae name Singer Charles 1931  Aristotles History of Animals classified organisms in relation to a hierarchical  scala naturae or  placing them according to complexity of structure and function so that higher organisms showed greater vitality and ability to move</span>
				<span class='text'>ristotle of course is not responsible for the later use made of this idea by clerics</span>
				<span class='text'>Aristotle believed that intellectual purposes i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>s guided all natural processes</span>
				<span class='text'>Such a  view gave Aristotle cause to justify his observed data as an expression of formal design</span>
				<span class='text'>Noting that no animal has at the same time both tusks and horns and a single hooved animal with two horns I have never seen Aristotle suggested that Nature giving no animal both horns and tusks was staving off vanity and giving creatures faculties only to such a degree as they are necessary</span>
				<span class='text'>Noting that ruminants had multiple stomachs and weak teeth he supposed the first was to compensate for the latter with Nature trying to preserve a type of balance</span>
				<span class='text'>ason A History of the Sciences pp</span>
				<span class='text'>43–44 In a similar fashion Aristotle believed that creatures were arranged in a graded scale of perfection rising from plants on up to man the scala naturae</span>
				<span class='text'>ayr The Growth of Biological Thought pp</span>
				<span class='text'>201–202 see also Lovejoy The Great Chain of Being  His system had eleven grades arranged according to the degree to which they are infected with potentiality expressed in their form at birth</span>
				<span class='text'>The highest animals laid warm and wet creatures alive the lowest bore theirs cold dry and in thick eggs</span>
				<span class='text'>ristotle also held that the level of a creatures perfection was lected in its form but not preordained by that form</span>
				<span class='text'>Ideas like this and his ideas about souls are not regarded as science at all in modern times</span>
				<span class='text'>e placed emphasis on the types of soul an organism possessed asserting that plants possess a vegetative soul responsible for reproduction and growth animals a vegetative and a sensitive soul responsible for mobility and sensation and humans a vegetative a sensitive and a rational soul capable of thought and lection</span>

				<span class='text'>This kind of soul is capable of the same powers as the other kinds Like the vegetative soul it can grow and nourish itself like the sensitive soul it can experience sensations and move locally</span>

				<span class='text'>du entries aristotle psychology  Psychology</span>
				<span class='text'> According to Aristotle  is the ability to hold a perceived experience in your mind and to have the ability to distinguish between the internal appearance and an occurrence in the past</span>
				<span class='text'> In other words a memory is a mental picture  in which Aristotle defines in De Anima as an appearance which is imprinted on the part of the body that forms a memory</span>
				<span class='text'>Aristotle believed an imprint becomes impressed on a semi fluid bodily organ that undergoes several changes in order to make a memory</span>
				<span class='text'>A memory occurs when a  is too complex that the nervous system semi fluid bodily organ cannot receive all the impressions at once</span>
				<span class='text'>These changes are the same as those involved in the operations of   and  </span>
				<span class='text'>The mental picture imprinted on the bodily organ is the final product of the entire process of sense perception</span>
				<span class='text'>It does not matter if the experience was seen or heard every experience ends up as a mental image in memory Aristotle uses the word memory for two basic abilities</span>
				<span class='text'>First the actual retaining of the experience in the  imprint that can develop from sensation</span>
				<span class='text'>Second the intellectual anxiety that comes with the imprint due to being impressed at a particular time and processing specific contents</span>
				<span class='text'>These abilities can be explained as memory is neither sensation nor thinking because is arises only after a lapse of time</span>
				<span class='text'>Theore memory is of the past  prediction is of the future and sensation is of the present</span>
				<span class='text'>The retrieval of our imprints cannot be performed suddenly</span>
				<span class='text'>A transitional channel is needed and located in our past experiences both for our previous experience and present experience</span>
				<span class='text'>ristotle proposed that slow witted people have good memory because the fluids in their brain do not wash away their memory organ used to imprint experiences and so the imprint can easily continue</span>
				<span class='text'>However they cannot be too slow or the hardened surface of the organ will not receive new imprints</span>
				<span class='text'>He believed the young and the old do not properly develop an imprint</span>
				<span class='text'>Young people undergo rapid changes as they develop while the elderlys organs are beginning to decay thus stunting new imprints</span>
				<span class='text'>Likewise people who are too quick witted are similar to the young and the image cannot be fixed because of the rapid changes of their organ</span>
				<span class='text'>Because intellectual functions are not involved in memory memories belong to some animals too but only those in which have  of time</span>
				<span class='text'>ecause Aristotle believes people receive all kinds of sense perceptions and people perceive them as images or imprints people are continually weaving together new imprints of things they experience</span>
				<span class='text'>In order to search for these imprints people search the memory itself</span>
				<span class='text'> Within the memory if one  is offered instead of a specific memory that person will reject this experience until they find what they are looking for</span>
				<span class='text'> occurs when one experience naturally follows another</span>
				<span class='text'>If the chain of images is needed one memory will stimulate the other</span>
				<span class='text'>If the chain of images is not needed but expected then it will only stimulate the other memory in most instances</span>
				<span class='text'>When people recall experiences they stimulate certain previous experiences until they have stimulated the one that was needed</span>
				<span class='text'>ecollection is the self directed activity of retrieving the information stored in a memory imprint after some time has passed</span>
				<span class='text'>Retrieval of stored information is dependent on the scope of mnemonic capabilities of a being human or animal and the abilities the human or animal possesses </span>
				<span class='text'>Only humans will remember imprints of intellectual activity such as numbers and words</span>
				<span class='text'>Animals that have perception of time will be able to retrieve memories of their past observations</span>
				<span class='text'>Remembering involves only perception of the things remembered and of the time passed</span>
				<span class='text'>Recollection of an imprint is when the present experiences a person remembers are similar with elements corresponding in character and arrangement of past sensory experiences</span>
				<span class='text'>When an imprint is recalled it may bring forth a large group of related imprints</span>
				<span class='text'>ristotle believed the chain of thought which ends in recollection of certain imprints was connected systematically in three sorts of relationships similarity contrast and contiguity</span>
				<span class='text'>These three laws make up his </span>
				<span class='text'>Aristotle believed that past experiences are hidden within our mind</span>
				<span class='text'>A force operates to awaken the hidden material to bring up the actual experience</span>
