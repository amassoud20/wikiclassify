				<span class='text'>Their classic line-up consisted of lead singer [[Roger Daltrey]], guitarist [[Pete Townshend]], bassist [[John Entwistle]], and drummer [[Keith Moon]]</span>
				<span class='text'>They are considered one of the most influential rock bands of the 20th&amp;nbsp;century, selling over [[List of best-selling music artists|100 million records worldwide]] and establishing their reputation equally on live shows and studio work</span>
				<span class='text'>he Who developed from an earlier group, the Detours, and established themselves as part of the [[pop art]] and [[mod (subculture)|mod movements]], featuring [[auto-destructive art]] by [[Instrument destruction|destroying guitars and drums]] on stage</span>
				<span class='text'>Their first single as the Who, &quot;[[I Can't Explain]]&quot;, reached the UK top&amp;nbsp;ten, followed by a string of singles including &quot;[[My Generation]]&quot;, &quot;[[Substitute (The Who song)|Substitute]]&quot; and &quot;[[Happy Jack (song)|Happy Jack]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1967, they performed at the [[Monterey Pop Festival]] and released the US top&amp;nbsp;ten single &quot;[[I Can See for Miles]]&quot;, while touring extensively</span>
				<span class='text'>The group's fourth album, 1969's [[rock opera]] ''[[Tommy (album)|Tommy]]'', included the single &quot;[[Pinball Wizard]]&quot; and was a critical and commercial success</span>
				<span class='text'>Live appearances at [[Woodstock]] and the [[Isle of Wight Festival]], along with the live album ''[[Live at Leeds]]'', cemented their reputation as a respected rock act</span>
				<span class='text'>With their success came increased pressure on lead songwriter and visionary Townshend, and the follow-up to ''Tommy'', ''[[Lifehouse (rock opera)|Lifehouse]]'', was abandoned</span>
				<span class='text'>Songs from the project made up 1971's ''[[Who's Next]]'', which included the hit &quot;[[Won't Get Fooled Again]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The group released the album ''[[Quadrophenia]]'' in 1973 as a celebration of their mod roots, and oversaw the [[Tommy (1975 film)|film adaptation of ''Tommy'']] in 1975</span>
				<span class='text'>They continued to tour to large audiences before semi-retiring from live performances at the end of 1976</span>
				<span class='text'>The release of ''[[Who Are You]]'' in 1978 was overshadowed by the death of Moon shortly after</span>
				<span class='text'>[Kenney Jones]] replaced Moon and the group resumed activity, releasing a [[Quadrophenia (film)|film adaptation of ''Quadrophenia'']] and the retrospective documentary ''[[The Kids Are Alright (film)|The Kids Are Alright]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>After Townshend became weary of touring, the group split in 1982</span>
				<span class='text'>The Who occasionally re-formed for live appearances such as [[Live Aid]] in 1985, a 25th&amp;nbsp;anniversary tour in 1989 and a tour of ''Quadrophenia'' in 1996</span>
				<span class='text'>They resumed regular touring in 1999, with drummer [[Zak Starkey]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After Entwistle's death in 2002, plans for a new album were delayed</span>
				<span class='text'>Townshend and Daltrey continued as the Who, releasing ''[[Endless Wire (The Who album)|Endless Wire]]'' in 2006, and continued to play live regularly</span>
				<span class='text'>he Who's major contributions to rock music include the development of the [[Marshall stack]], large [[public address system|PA systems]], use of the [[synthesizer]], Entwistle and Moon's lead playing styles, Townshend's feedback and power chord guitar technique, and the development of the rock opera</span>
				<span class='text'>They are cited as an influence by [[hard rock]], [[punk rock]] and mod bands, and their songs still receive regular exposure</span>

				<span class='text'>alt=Photograph of Ealing Art College in 2010]]The founding members of the Who, [[Roger Daltrey]], [[Pete Townshend]] and [[John Entwistle]], grew up in [[Acton, London]] and went to [[Acton High School|Acton County Grammar School]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=13, 19, 24}} Townshend's father, [[Cliff Townshend|Cliff]], played saxophone and his mother, Betty, had sung in the entertainment division of the [[Royal Air Force]] during [[World War II]], and both supported their son's interest in [[rock and roll]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=15–16}} Townshend and Entwistle became friends in their second year of Acton County, and formed a [[trad jazz]] group;{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=26}} Entwistle also played [[French horn]] in the Middlesex Schools' Symphony Orchestra</span>
				<span class='text'>Both were interested in rock, and Townshend particularly admired [[Cliff Richard]]'s début single, &quot;[[Move It]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=17}} Entwistle moved to guitar, but struggled with it due to his large fingers, and moved to bass on hearing the guitar work of [[Duane Eddy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was unable to afford a bass and built one at home</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=29}}{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=17}} After Acton County, Townshend attended [[Ealing Art College]],{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=20}} a move he later described as profoundly influential on the course of the Who</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=22}}Daltrey, who was in the year above, had moved to Acton from [[Shepherd's Bush]], a more working-class area</span>
				<span class='text'>He had trouble fitting in at the school, and discovered gangs and rock and roll</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=14}} He was expelled at 15 and found work on a building site</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=11}} In 1959 he started the Detours, the band that was to evolve into the Who</span>
				<span class='text'>The band played professional gigs, such as corporate and wedding functions, and Daltrey kept a close eye on the finances as well as the music</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=31}}Daltrey spotted Entwistle by chance on the street carrying a bass and recruited him into the Detours</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=18}} In mid-1961, Entwistle suggested Townshend as a guitarist,{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=18}} Daltrey on lead guitar, Entwistle on bass, Harry Wilson on drums, and Colin Dawson on vocals</span>
				<span class='text'> The band played instrumentals by [[the Shadows]] and [[the Ventures]], and a variety of pop and trad jazz covers</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=19}} Daltrey was considered the leader and, according to Townshend, &quot;ran things the way he wanted them&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=22}} Wilson was fired in mid-1962 and replaced by [[Doug Sandom]], though he was older than the rest of the band, married, and a more proficient musician, having been playing semi-professionally for two years</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|pp=19–20}}Dawson left after frequently arguing with Daltrey{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=22}} and after being briefly replaced by Gabby Connolly, Daltrey moved to lead vocals</span>
				<span class='text'>Townshend, with Entwistle's encouragement, became the sole guitarist</span>
				<span class='text'>Through Townshend's mother, the group obtained a management contract with local promoter Robert Druce,{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=21}} who started booking the band as a support act</span>
				<span class='text'>The Detours were influenced by the bands they supported, including [[Screaming Lord Sutch]], [[Cliff Bennett and the Rebel Rousers]], [[Shane Fenton]] and the Fentones, and [[Johnny Kidd and the Pirates]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Detours were particularly interested in the Pirates as they also only had one guitarist, [[Mick Green]], who inspired Townshend to combine rhythm and lead guitar in his style</span>
				<span class='text'> Entwistle's bass became more of a lead instrument,{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=24}} playing melodies</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Atkins|2000|p=65}} In February 1964, the Detours became aware of the group Johnny Devlin and the Detours and changed their name</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=26}} Townshend and his room-mate Richard Barnes spent a night considering names, focusing on a theme of joke announcements, including &quot;No One&quot; and &quot;the Group&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Townshend preferred &quot;the Hair&quot;, and Barnes liked &quot;the Who&quot; because it &quot;had a pop punch&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=65}} Daltrey chose &quot;the Who&quot; the next morning</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=66}}===1964–1978=======Early career====By the time the Detours had become the Who, they had already found regular gigs, including at the Oldfield Hotel in Greenford, the White Hart Hotel in Acton, the Goldhawk Social Club in Shepherd's Bush, and the Notre Dame Hall in Leicester Square</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=68}} They had also replaced Druce as manager with Helmut Gorden, with whom they secured an audition with Chris Parmeinter for [[Fontana Records]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=70}} Parmeinter found problems with the drumming and, according to Sandom, Townshend immediately turned on him and threatened to fire him if his playing did not immediately improve</span>
				<span class='text'>Sandom left in disgust, but was persuaded to lend his kit to any potential stand-ins or replacements</span>
				<span class='text'>Sandom and Townshend did not speak to each other again for 14 years</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=78–79}}During a gig with a stand-in drummer in late April at the Oldfield, the band first met Keith Moon</span>
				<span class='text'>Moon grew up in [[Wembley]], and had been drumming in bands since 1961</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=29}} He was performing with a semi-professional band called the Beachcombers, and wanted to play full-time</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=80}} Moon played a few songs with the group, breaking a bass drum pedal and tearing a drum skin</span>
				<span class='text'>The band were impressed with his energy and enthusiasm, and offered him the job</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=73}} Moon performed with the Beachcombers a few more times, but dates clashed and he chose to devote himself to the Who</span>
				<span class='text'>The Beachcombers auditioned Sandom, but were unimpressed and did not ask him to join</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Fletcher|1998|pp=80–81}}The Who changed managers to [[Peter Meaden]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He decided that the group would be ideal to represent the growing [[mod (subculture)|mod]] movement in Britain which involved fashion, [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooters]] and music genres such as [[rhythm and blues]], [[soul music|soul]] and [[beat music|beat]]</span>

				<span class='text'>The tune for &quot;Zoot Suit&quot; was &quot;Misery&quot; by the Dynamics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Icons of Rock|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=240|isbn=978-0-313-33845-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;I'm the Face&quot; borrowed from [[Slim Harpo]]'s &quot;I Got Love If You Want It&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Fletcher|1998|pp=91–92}} Although Meaden tried to promote the single, it failed to reach the top 50{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=54}} and the band reverted to calling themselves the Who</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=60}} The group began to improve their stage image; Daltrey started using his microphone cable as a [[whip]] on stage, and occasionally leapt into the crowd; Moon threw drumsticks into the air mid-beat; Townshend mimed [[machine gun]]ning the crowd with his guitar while jumping on stage and playing guitar with a fast arm-windmilling motion,{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=120}} or stood with his arms aloft allowing his guitar to produce feedback in a posture dubbed &quot;the Bird Man&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|DiPerna|1994|p=44}}Meaden was replaced as manager by two filmmakers, [[Kit Lambert]] and [[Chris Stamp]]</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=55}}&lt;ref&gt;The Railway burned down in 2002 and became blocks of flats named after members of the band</span>
				<span class='text'>{PastScape|mnumber=1440043 |mname=THE RAILWAY HOTEL|accessdate=25 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lambert related to Townshend and his art school background, and encouraged him to write songs</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;kurutz&quot;/&gt; In August, Lambert and Stamp made a promotional film featuring the group and their audience at the Railway</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=56}} The band changed their set towards soul, [[rhythm and blues]] and [[Motown]] covers, and created the slogan &quot;Maximum R&amp;B&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;eder&quot;/&gt;In June 1964, during a performance at the Railway, Townshend accidentally broke the head of his guitar on the low ceiling of the stage</span>

				<span class='text'>Retrieved 23 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Angered by the audience's laughter, he smashed the instrument on the stage, then picked up another guitar and continued the show</span>
				<span class='text'>The following week, the audience were keen to see a repeat of the event</span>
				<span class='text'>Moon obliged by kicking his drum kit over,{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=125}} and [[auto-destructive art]] became a feature of the Who's live set</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=126}}====First singles and ''My Generation''====By late&amp;nbsp;1964, the Who were becoming popular in London's [[The Marquee|Marquee]] club, and a rave review of their live act appeared in ''[[Melody Maker]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=134}} Lambert and Stamp attracted the attention of the American producer [[Shel Talmy]], who had produced [[the Kinks]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Townshend had written a song, &quot;[[I Can't Explain]]&quot;, that deliberately sounded like the Kinks to attract Talmy's attention</span>
				<span class='text'>Talmy saw the group in rehearsals and was impressed</span>
				<span class='text'>He signed them to his production company,{{sfn|Howard|2004|pp=106–107}} and sold the recording to the US arm of [[Decca Records]], which meant that the group's early singles were released in Britain on [[Brunswick Records]], one of UK Decca's labels for US artists</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=151–152}} &quot;I Can't Explain&quot; was recorded in early November 1964 at Pye Studios in [[Marble Arch]] with [[The Ivy League (band)|the Ivy League]] on backing vocals, and [[Jimmy Page]] played [[fuzz guitar]] on the B-side, &quot;Bald Headed Woman&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=60}}&quot;I Can't Explain&quot; became popular with [[pirate radio in the United Kingdom|pirate radio]] stations such as [[Radio Caroline]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=152}} Pirate radio was important for bands as there were no commercial radio stations in the UK and [[BBC Radio]] played little pop music</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=100}} The group gained further exposure when they appeared on the television programme ''[[Ready Steady Go!]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;eder&quot;/&gt; Lambert and Stamp were tasked with finding &quot;typical teens&quot;, and invited the group's regular audience from the Goldhawk Social Club</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;carr&quot;&gt;{{cite AV media notes|title=The Kids are Alright (soundtrack)|publisher=Polydor|year=1979|first=Roy|last=Carr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enthusiastic reception on television and regular airplay on pirate radio helped the single slowly climb the charts in early 1965 until it reached the top 10</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=419}} The follow-up single, &quot;[[Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere]]&quot;, by Townshend and Daltrey,{{sfn|Howard|2004|pp=107–108}} features guitar noises such as [[Pick slide|pick sliding]], toggle switching{{sfn|Aledort|1994|p=58}} and [[audio feedback|feedback]], which was so unconventional that it was initially rejected by the US arm of Decca</span>
				<span class='text'>The single reached the top&amp;nbsp;10 in the UK{{sfn|Howard|2004|pp=107–108}} and was used as the theme song to ''Ready Steady Go!''{{sfn|Aledort|1994|p=57}}The transition to a hit-making band with original material, encouraged by Lambert, did not sit well with Daltrey, and a recording session of R&amp;B covers went unreleased</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=121}} The Who were not close friends either, apart from Moon and Entwistle, who enjoyed visiting nightclubs together in the [[West End of London]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=126}} The group experienced a difficult time when touring Denmark in September, which culminated in Daltrey throwing Moon's [[amphetamine]]s down the toilet and assaulting him</span>
				<span class='text'>Immediately on returning to Britain, Daltrey was sacked,{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=93}} but was reinstated on the condition that the group became a democracy without his dominant leadership</span>
				<span class='text'>At this time, the group enlisted [[Richard Cole]] as a roadie</span>

				<span class='text'>}The next single, &quot;[[My Generation]]&quot;, followed in October</span>
				<span class='text'>Townshend had written it as a slow blues, but after several abortive attempts, it was turned into a more powerful song with a bass solo from Entwistle</span>
				<span class='text'>The song used gimmicks such as a vocal [[stutter]] to simulate the speech of a mod on [[substituted amphetamine|amphetamines]], and two [[Modulation (music)|key changes]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=182}} Townshend insisted in interviews that the lyrics &quot;Hope I die before I get old&quot; were not meant to be taken literally</span>

				<span class='text'>{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=199}} The resulting legal acrimony resulted in Talmy holding the rights to the master tapes, which prevented the album from being reissued until 2002</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Howard|2004|p=108}} The Who were signed to [[Robert Stigwood]]'s label, Reaction, and released &quot;[[Substitute (The Who song)|Substitute]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Townshend said he wrote the song about identity crisis, and as a parody of [[the Rolling Stones]]'s &quot;[[19th Nervous Breakdown]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>It was the first single to feature him playing an acoustic [[twelve-string guitar]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=200–201}} Talmy took legal action over the B-side, &quot;Instant Party&quot;, and the single was withdrawn</span>
