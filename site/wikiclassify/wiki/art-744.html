				<span class='text'>His eighteen-year term as General Secretary was second only to that of [[Joseph Stalin]] in duration</span>
				<span class='text'>During [[History of the Soviet Union (1964‚Äì82)|Brezhnev's rule]], the global influence of the Soviet Union grew dramatically, in part because of the expansion of the Soviet military during this time</span>
				<span class='text'>His tenure as leader was marked by the beginning of an era of economic and social stagnation in the Soviet Union</span>
				<span class='text'>rezhnev was born in [[Dniprodzerzhynsk|Kamenskoe]] into a Russian worker's family</span>
				<span class='text'>After graduating from the Dniprodzerzhynsk Metallurgical [[Technicum]], he became a [[metallurgical engineer]] in the [[iron and steel industry]], in Ukraine</span>
				<span class='text'>He joined [[Komsomol]] in 1923, and in 1929 became an active member of the CPSU</span>
				<span class='text'>He was drafted into immediate military service during [[World War II]] and left the army in 1946 with the rank of [[major general]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1952 Brezhnev became a member of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]], and during 1964, Brezhnev succeeded [[Nikita Khrushchev]] as First Secretary, while [[Alexei Kosygin]] succeeded Khrushchev in his post as [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Soviet premier]]</span>
				<span class='text'>s a leader, Brezhnev took care to consult his colleagues before acting, but his attempt to govern without meaningful economic reforms led to a national decline by the mid-1970s, a period referred to as the [[Era of Stagnation]]</span>
				<span class='text'>A significant increase in military expenditure, which by the time of Brezhnev's death stood at approximately 12</span>
				<span class='text'>% of the country's [[GNP]], and an aging and ineffective leadership set the stage for a dwindling GNP compared to Western nations</span>
				<span class='text'>While at the helm of the USSR, Brezhnev pushed for d√©tente between the Eastern and Western countries</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time he presided over the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]] to stop the [[Prague Spring]], and his last major decision in power was to [[Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War|send the Soviet military to Afghanistan]] in an attempt to save the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|fragile regime]], which was fighting a war against the [[mujahideen]]</span>
				<span class='text'>fter suffering from various illnesses for several years, [[Death and state funeral of Leonid Brezhnev|Brezhnev died]] on 10 November 1982 and was quickly succeeded in his post as General Secretary by [[Yuri Andropov]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Brezhnev had fostered a [[cult of personality]], although not nearly to the same degree as Stalin</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Mikhail Gorbachev]], who would lead the USSR from 1985 to 1991, denounced his legacy and drove the process of [[liberalisation]] of the Soviet Union</span>

				<span class='text'>He graduated from the Dniprodzerzhynsk Metallurgical [[Technicum]] in 1935{{sfn|McCauley|1997|p=47}} and became a metallurgical engineer in the iron and steel industries of eastern Ukraine</span>
				<span class='text'>==Political development===Brezhnev joined the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] youth organisation, the [[Komsomol]], in 1923, and the Party itself in 1929</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bacon|Sandle|2002|p=6}} In 1935 and 1936, Brezhnev served his compulsory military service, and after taking courses at a tank school, he served as a [[political commissar]] in a tank factory</span>
				<span class='text'>Later in 1936, he became director of the Dniprodzerzhynsk Metallurgical Technicum (technical college)</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1936, he was transferred to the regional center of [[Dnipropetrovsk]] and, in 1939, he became Party Secretary in Dnipropetrovsk,{{sfn|McCauley|1997|p=47}} in charge of the city's important defence industries</span>
				<span class='text'>As a survivor of Stalin's [[Great Purge]] of 1937‚Äì39, he was able to advance quickly as the purges created numerous openings in the senior and middle ranks of the Party and state governments</span>

				<span class='text'>He worked to evacuate Dnipropetrovsk's industries to the east of the Soviet Union before the city fell to the Germans on 26 August, and then was assigned as a [[political commissar]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In October, Brezhnev was made deputy of political administration for the [[Soviet Southern Front|Southern Front]], with the rank of Brigade-Commissar (Colonel)</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Green|Reeves|1993|p=192}}When Ukraine was occupied by the Germans in 1942, Brezhnev was sent to the [[Caucasus]] as deputy head of political administration of the [[Transcaucasian Front]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In April 1943, he became head of the Political Department of the 18th Army</span>

				<span class='text'>After working on reconstruction projects in Ukraine, he again became General Secretary in Dnipropetrovsk</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1950, he became a deputy of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]], the Soviet Union's highest legislative body</span>
				<span class='text'>Later that year he was appointed Party First Secretary in [[Moldavian SSR|Moldavia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|McCauley|1997|p=48}} In 1952, he had a meeting with [[Stalin]] after which Stalin promoted Brezhnev to the Communist Party's [[Central Committee]] as a candidate member of the Presidium (formerly the [[Politburo]])</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bacon|Sandle|2002|p=7}}Stalin died in March 1953, and in the reorganisation that followed, the Presidium was abolished and a smaller Politburo reconstituted</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Brezhnev was not made a Politburo member, he was appointed head of the Political Directorate of the Army and the Navy with the rank of [[Lieutenant-General]], a very senior position</span>
				<span class='text'>Brezhnev's patron Khrushchev succeeded Stalin as General Secretary, while Khrushchev's opponent [[Malenkov]] succeeded Stalin as Chairman of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Brezhnev sided with Khrushchev against Malenkov, but only for several years</span>
				<span class='text'>On 7 May 1955, Brezhnev was made General Secretary of the [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan|Communist Party]] of the [[Kazakh SSR]]</span>
				<span class='text'>On the surface, his brief was simple: to make the new lands agriculturally productive</span>
				<span class='text'>In reality, Brezhnev became involved in the development of the Soviet missile and nuclear arms programs, including the [[Baykonur Cosmodrome]]</span>

				<span class='text'>thumb|right|Khrushchev in 1963, one year before his ousting]]Until about 1962, Khrushchev's position as Party leader was secure; but as the leader aged, he grew more erratic and his performance undermined the confidence of his fellow leaders</span>
				<span class='text'>The Soviet Union's mounting economic problems also increased the pressure on Khrushchev's leadership</span>
				<span class='text'>Outwardly, Brezhnev remained loyal to Khrushchev, but became involved in a 1963 plot to remove the leader from power, possibly playing a leading role</span>
				<span class='text'>Also in 1963, Brezhnev succeeded [[Frol Kozlov]], another Khrushchev prot√©g√©, as Secretary of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]], positioning him as Khrushchev's likely successor</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=615}} Khrushchev made him [[Second Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Second Secretary]], literally deputy party leader, in 1964</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=616}}After returning from [[Scandinavia]] and [[Czechoslovakia]] in October 1964, Khrushchev, unaware of the plot, went on holiday in [[Pitsunda]] resort on the [[Black Sea]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon his return, his Presidium officers congratulated him for his work in office</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Anastas Mikoyan]] visited Khrushchev, hinting that he should not be too complacent about his present situation</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Vladimir Semichastny]], head of the [[KGB]],{{sfn|Service|2009|p=376}} was a crucial part of the conspiracy, as it was his duty to inform Khrushchev if anyone was plotting against his leadership</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Nikolay Ignatov]], who had been sacked by Khrushchev, discreetly requested the opinion of several [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] members</span>
				<span class='text'>After some false starts, fellow conspirator [[Mikhail Suslov]] phoned Khrushchev on 12 October and requested that he return to [[Moscow]] to discuss the state of [[Soviet agriculture]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally Khrushchev understood what was happening, and said to Mikoyan, &quot;If it's me who is the question, I will not make a fight of it</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Service|2009|p=377}} While a minority headed by Mikoyan wanted to remove Khrushchev from the office of First Secretary but retain him as the [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]], the majority, headed by Brezhnev, wanted to remove him from active politics altogether</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Service|2009|p=377}}Brezhnev and [[Nikolai Podgorny]] appealed to the Central Committee, blaming Khrushchev for economic failures, and accusing him of voluntarism and immodest behavior</span>
				<span class='text'>Influenced by the Brezhnev allies, Politburo members voted to remove Khrushchev from office</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=5}} In addition, some members of the Central Committee wanted him to undergo punishment of some kind</span>
				<span class='text'>But Brezhnev, who had already been assured the office of the General Secretary, saw little reason to punish his old mentor further</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Service|2009|p=378}} Brezhnev was appointed First Secretary, but at the time was believed to be a transition leader of sorts, who would only &quot;keep the shop&quot; until another leader was appointed</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|McNeal|1975|p=164}} [[Alexei Kosygin]] was appointed [[head of government]], and Mikoyan was retained as [[head of state]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=16}} Brezhnev and his companions supported the general party line taken after [[Joseph Stalin]]'s death, but felt that Khrushchev's reforms had removed much of the Soviet Union's stability</span>

				<span class='text'>Another sector that was hitting the wall was the [[sugar beet]] harvest, which had declined by 2% in the 1970s</span>
				<span class='text'>Brezhnev's way of resolving these issues was to increase state investment</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Service|2009|p=402}} The resolution ordered [[kolkhoz]]es close to each other to collaborate in their efforts to increase production</span>
				<span class='text'>In the meantime, the state's subsidies to the food-and-agriculture sector did not prevent bankrupt farms from operating: rises in the price of produce were offset by rises in the cost of oil and other resources</span>
				<span class='text'>By 1977, oil cost 84% more than it did in the late 1960s</span>
				<span class='text'>The cost of other resources had also climbed by the late 1970s</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Service|2009|p=402}}Brezhnev's answer to these problems was to issue two decrees, one in 1977 and one in 1981, which called for an increase in the maximum size of privately owned plots within the Soviet Union to half a hectare</span>
				<span class='text'>These measures removed important obstacles for the expansion of agricultural output, but did not solve the problem</span>
				<span class='text'>Under Brezhnev, private plots yielded 30% of the national agricultural production when they only cultivated 4% of [[agriculture in the Soviet Union|the land]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This was seen by some as proof that de-collectivisation was necessary to prevent Soviet agriculture from collapsing, but leading Soviet politicians shrank from supporting such drastic measures due to ideological and political interests</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Service|2009|p=402}} The underlying problems were the growing shortage of skilled workers, a wrecked rural culture, the payment of workers in proportion to the quantity rather than the quality of their work, too large farm machinery for the small collective farms and the roadless countryside</span>
