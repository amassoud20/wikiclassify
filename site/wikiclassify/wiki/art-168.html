				<span class='text'>Japan's ally Germany surrendered in early May 1945</span>
				<span class='text'>In June, the cabinet reassessed the war strategy, only to decide more firmly than ever on a fight to the last man</span>
				<span class='text'>This strategy was officially affirmed at a brief Imperial Council meeting, at which, as was normal, the Emperor did not speak</span>
				<span class='text'>he following day, [[Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal of Japan|Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal]] [[Kōichi Kido]] prepared a draft document which summarized the hopeless military situation and proposed a negotiated settlement</span>
				<span class='text'>According to some commentators,{{Who|date=July 2007}} the Emperor privately approved of it and authorized Kido to circulate it discreetly amongst less hawkish cabinet members; others suggest that the Emperor was indecisive, and that the delay cost many tens of thousands of lives</span>
				<span class='text'>Extremists in Japan were also calling for a death-before-dishonor mass suicide, modeled on the &quot;[[Forty-seven Ronin|47 Ronin]]&quot; incident</span>
				<span class='text'>By mid-June 1945, the cabinet had agreed to approach the Soviet Union to act as a mediator for a negotiated surrender, but not before Japan's bargaining position had been improved by repulse of the anticipated Allied invasion of mainland Japan</span>
				<span class='text'>n June 22, the Emperor met with his ministers, saying &quot;I desire that concrete plans to end the war, unhampered by existing policy, be speedily studied and that efforts be made to implement them</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The attempt to negotiate a peace via the Soviet Union came to nothing</span>
				<span class='text'>There was always the threat that extremists would carry out a coup or foment other violence</span>
				<span class='text'>On July 26, 1945, the Allies issued the [[Potsdam Declaration]] demanding [[unconditional surrender]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Japanese government council, the Big Six, considered that option and recommended to the Emperor that it be accepted only if one to four conditions were agreed, including a guarantee of the Emperor's continued position in [[Culture of Japan|Japanese society]]</span>

				<span class='text'>==The Emperor and the atomic bomb===On August 9, 1945, following the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] and the Soviet declaration of war, Emperor Hirohito told Kido to &quot;quickly control the situation&quot; because &quot;the Soviet Union has declared war and today began hostilities against us</span>

				<span class='text'>n August 12, 1945, the Emperor informed the imperial family of his decision to surrender</span>
				<span class='text'>One of his uncles, [[Prince Asaka]], asked whether the war would be continued if the ''[[kokutai]]'' (national polity) could not be preserved</span>

				<span class='text'>n August 15, a recording of the Emperor's surrender speech ([[Gyokuon-hōsō|&quot;Gyokuon-hōsō&quot;, literally &quot;Jewel Voice Broadcast&quot;]]) was broadcast over the radio (the first time the Emperor was heard on the radio by the Japanese people) signifying the unconditional surrender of Japan's military forces</span>
				<span class='text'> During the historic broadcast the Emperor stated: &quot;Moreover, the enemy has begun to employ a new and most cruel bomb, the power of which to do damage is, indeed, incalculable, taking the toll of many innocent lives</span>
				<span class='text'>Should We continue to fight, not only would it result in an ultimate collapse and obliteration of the Japanese nation, but also it would lead to the total extinction of human civilization</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The surrender speech also noted that &quot;the war situation has developed not necessarily to Japan's advantage&quot; and ordered the Japanese to &quot;endure the unendurable&quot; in surrender</span>
				<span class='text'>The speech, using formal, archaic Japanese, was not readily understood by many commoners</span>
				<span class='text'>According to historian Richard Storry in ''A History of Modern Japan'', the Emperor typically used &quot;a form of language familiar only to the well-educated&quot; and to the more traditional [[samurai]] families</span>

				<span class='text'>However, the physical recording of the surrender speech was hidden and preserved overnight, and the coup was quickly crushed on the Emperor's order</span>
				<span class='text'>==Accountability for Japanese war crimes===Some historians believe Emperor Hirohito was directly responsible for [[Japanese war crimes|the atrocities committed by the imperial forces]] in the Second Sino-Japanese War and in World War II</span>
				<span class='text'>They feel that he, and some members of the imperial family such as his brother [[Prince Chichibu]], his cousins [[Prince Takeda Tsuneyoshi|Prince Takeda]] and [[Prince Fushimi Hiroyasu|Prince Fushimi]], and his uncles [[Prince Kan'in]], [[Prince Asaka]], and [[Prince Higashikuni Naruhiko|Prince Higashikuni]], should have been tried for [[war crime]]s</span>

				<span class='text'>Article 4 prescribed that, &quot;The Emperor is the head of the Empire, combining in Himself the rights of sovereignty, and exercises them, according to the provisions of the present Constitution,&quot; while, according to article 6, &quot;The Emperor gives sanction to laws and orders them to be promulgated and executed,&quot; and article 11, &quot;The Emperor has the supreme command of the Army and the Navy</span>

				<span class='text'>September 17, 1945</span>
				<span class='text'>]As the Emperor chose his uncle [[Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni|Prince Higashikuni]] as prime minister to assist the occupation, there were attempts by numerous leaders to have him put on trial for alleged [[war crimes]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Many members of the imperial family, such as Princes Chichibu, Takamatsu and Higashikuni, pressured the Emperor to abdicate so that one of the Princes could serve as regent until Crown Prince [[Akihito]] came of age</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bix, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>571–573</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; On February 27, 1946, the Emperor's youngest brother, [[Prince Mikasa]] (Takahito), even stood up in the privy council and indirectly urged the Emperor to step down and accept responsibility for Japan's defeat</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Minister of Welfare Ashida's diary, &quot;Everyone seemed to ponder Mikasa's words</span>
				<span class='text'>Never have I seen His Majesty's face so pale</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>General [[Douglas MacArthur]] insisted that Emperor Hirohito retain the throne</span>
				<span class='text'>MacArthur saw the Emperor as a symbol of the continuity and cohesion of the Japanese people</span>
				<span class='text'>Some historians criticize the decision to exonerate the Emperor and all members of the imperial family who were implicated in the war, such as [[Prince Chichibu]], [[Prince Asaka]], Prince Higashikuni and Prince [[Hiroyasu Fushimi]], from criminal prosecutions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Dower, Bix</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Before the war crime trials actually convened, the [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers|SCAP]], the [[International Peace and Security|IPS]], and Japanese officials worked behind the scenes not only to prevent the Imperial family from being indicted, but also to slant the testimony of the defendants to ensure that no one implicated the Emperor</span>
				<span class='text'>High officials in court circles and the Japanese government collaborated with Allied GHQ in compiling lists of prospective war criminals, while the individuals arrested as ''Class A'' suspects and incarcerated solemnly vowed to protect their sovereign against any possible taint of war responsibility</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Dower, p</span>
				<span class='text'>325</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Thus, &quot;months before the [[Tokyo tribunal]] commenced, MacArthur's highest subordinates were working to attribute ultimate responsibility for [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] to [[Hideki Tōjō]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dower, p</span>
				<span class='text'>585</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; by allowing &quot;the major criminal suspects to coordinate their stories so that the Emperor would be spared from indictment</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dower, p</span>
				<span class='text'>583</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; According to [[John W</span>
				<span class='text'>Dower]], &quot;This successful campaign to absolve the Emperor of war responsibility knew no bounds</span>
				<span class='text'>Hirohito was not merely presented as being innocent of any formal acts that might make him culpable to indictment as a war criminal, he was turned into an almost saintly figure who did not even bear moral responsibility for the war</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dower, p</span>
				<span class='text'>326</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; According to Bix, &quot;MacArthur's truly extraordinary measures to save Hirohito from trial as a war criminal had a lasting and profoundly distorting impact on Japanese understanding of the lost war</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bix, p</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;=== Imperial status ===[[File:Emperor Showa visit to Hiroshima in 1947</span>

				<span class='text'>308–318</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; to explicitly reject (in the {{nihongo|''[[Ningen-sengen]]''|人間宣言}}) the quasi-official claim that the Emperor of Japan was an ''[[arahitogami]]'', i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> an incarnate divinity</span>
				<span class='text'>This was motivated by the fact that, according to the [[Meiji Constitution|Japanese constitution of 1889]], the Emperor had a divine power over his country, which was derived from the [[Shinto]] belief that the Japanese Imperial Family was the offspring of the sun goddess [[Amaterasu]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Hirohito was however persistent in the idea that the Emperor of Japan should be considered a descendant of the gods</span>
				<span class='text'>In December 1945 he told his vice-grand chamberlain Michio Kinoshita: &quot;It is permissible to say that the idea that the Japanese are descendants of the gods is a false conception; but it is absolutely impermissible to call [[wiktionary:chimerical|chimerical]] the idea that the Emperor is a descendant of the gods</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wetzler, p</span>
				<span class='text'>3</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In any case, the &quot;renunciation of divinity&quot; was noted more by foreigners than by Japanese, and seems to have been intended for the consumption of the former</span>
				<span class='text'>{efn|Many foreigners, including those from the occupying power, were from [[Western civilization|Western countries]] steeped in [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[Abrahamic religion|Abrahamic traditions]]</span>
				<span class='text'>} The theory of a constitutional monarchy had already had some proponents in Japan</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1935, when Tatsukichi Minobe advocated the theory that sovereignty resides in the states, of which the Emperor is just an organ (the ''tennō kikan setsu''), it caused a furor</span>
				<span class='text'>He was forced to resign from the House of Peers and his post at the Tokyo Imperial University, his books were banned and an attempt was made on his life</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Not until 1946 was the tremendous step made to alter the Emperor's title from &quot;imperial sovereign&quot; to &quot;[[constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarch]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough the Emperor had supposedly repudiated claims to divine status, his public position was deliberately left vague, partly because General MacArthur thought him likely to be a useful partner to get the Japanese to accept the occupation, and partly due to behind-the-scenes maneuverings by [[Shigeru Yoshida]] to thwart attempts to cast him as a European-style monarch</span>

				<span class='text'>This boycott lasted from 1978 until the time of his death</span>
				<span class='text'>This boycott has been maintained by his son [[Akihito]], who has also refused to attend Yasukuni</span>
				<span class='text'>n July 20, 2006, ''[[Nihon Keizai Shimbun]]'' published a front page article about the discovery of a memorandum detailing the reason that the Emperor stopped visiting Yasukuni</span>
				<span class='text'>The memorandum, kept by former chief of [[Imperial Household Agency]] Tomohiko Tomita, confirms for the first time that the enshrinement of 14 [[Class A War Criminal]]s in Yasukuni was the reason for the boycott</span>
				<span class='text'>Tomita recorded in detail the contents of his conversations with the Emperor in his diaries and notebooks</span>
				<span class='text'>According to the memorandum, in 1988, the Emperor expressed his strong displeasure at the decision made by Yasukuni Shrine to include Class-A war criminals in the list of war dead honored there by saying, &quot;At some point, Class-A criminals became enshrined, including [[Yōsuke Matsuoka|Matsuoka]] and [[Toshio Shiratori|Shiratori]]</span>
				<span class='text'>I heard Tsukuba acted cautiously</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Tsukuba is believed to refer to Fujimaro Tsukuba, the former chief Yasukuni priest at the time, who decided not to enshrine the war criminals despite having received in 1966 the list of war dead compiled by the government</span>
