				<span class='text'>quot; In 1952, as candidate for the ''[[Frente de Acción Popular]]'' (Popular Action Front, FRAP), he obtained only 5</span>
				<span class='text'>% of the votes, partly due to a division within socialist ranks over support for [[Carlos Ibáñez]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1958, again as the FRAP candidate, Allende obtained 28</span>
				<span class='text'>% of the vote</span>
				<span class='text'>This time, his defeat was attributed to votes lost to the [[populism|populist]] Antonio Zamorano</span>
				<span class='text'>eclassified documents show that from 1962 through 1964, the [[CIA]] spent a total of $2</span>
				<span class='text'> millions to finance the campaign of [[Eduardo Frei Montalva|Eduardo Frei]] and spent $3 millions in anti-Allende propaganda &quot;to scare voters away from Allende's FRAP coalition&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>with the goal of redirecting government activity toward the path of law and ensuring the Constitutional order of our Nation, and the essential underpinnings of democratic co-existence among Chileans</span>

				<span class='text'>quot; Essentially, most of the accusations were about disregard by the Socialist government of the separation of powers, and arrogating legislative and judicial prerogatives to the executive branch of government</span>
				<span class='text'>pecifically, the Socialist government of President Allende was accused of:* [[Rule by decree|Ruling by decree]], thwarting the normal legislative system* Refusing to enforce judicial decisions against its partisans; not carrying out sentences and judicial resolutions that contravened its objectives* Ignoring the decrees of the independent General Comptroller's Office* Sundry media offenses; usurping control of the National Television Network and applying economic pressure against those media organizations that are not unconditional supporters of the government* Allowing its Socialist supporters to assemble with arms, and preventing the same by its right-wing opponents* Supporting more than 1,500 illegal takeovers of farms* Illegal repression of the [[El Teniente]] miners’ strike* Illegally limiting emigrationFinally, the resolution condemned the creation and development of government-protected [socialist] armed groups, which were said to be &quot;headed towards a confrontation with the armed forces&quot;</span>
