				<span class='text'>vg}}'''Samuel Finley Breese Morse''' (April 27, 1791 – April 2, 1872) was an American painter and inventor</span>
				<span class='text'>After having established his reputation as a portrait painter, in his middle age Morse contributed to the [[invention]] of a single-wire [[telegraphy|telegraph]] system based on European telegraphs</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a co-developer of the [[Morse code]], and helped to develop the commercial use of telegraphy</span>

				<span class='text'>Morse was born in [[Charlestown, Massachusetts]], the first child of the [[pastor]] [[Jedidiah Morse]] (1761–1826), who was also a geographer, and his wife Elizabeth Ann Finley Breese (1766–1828)</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Mabee|2004}} His father was a great preacher of the [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] faith and supporter of the [[Federalist Party (United States)|American Federalist party]]</span>
				<span class='text'> He thought it helped preserve [[Puritan]] traditions (strict observance of [[Christian Sabbath|Sabbath]], among other things), and believed in the Federalist support of an alliance with Britain and a strong central government</span>
				<span class='text'>Morse strongly believed in education within a Federalist framework, alongside the instillation of Calvinist virtues, morals and prayers for his first son</span>
				<span class='text'>fter attending [[Phillips Academy]] in [[Andover, Massachusetts]], Samuel Morse went on to [[Yale College]] to receive instruction in the subjects of [[religious philosophy]], [[mathematics]] and science of horses</span>
				<span class='text'>While at Yale, he attended lectures on [[electricity]] from [[Benjamin Silliman]] and [[Jeremiah Day]], and was a member of the Society of [[Brothers in Unity]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He supported himself by painting</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1810, he graduated from Yale with [[Phi Beta Kappa]] honors</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|Self-portrait of Morse in 1812 ([[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]])]]Morse expressed some of his Calvinist beliefs in his painting, ''Landing of the Pilgrims'', through the depiction of simple clothing as well as the people's austere facial features</span>
				<span class='text'>His image captured the psychology of the Federalists; Calvinists from England brought to North America ideas of religion and government, thus linking the two countries</span>
				<span class='text'>This work attracted the attention of the notable artist [[Washington Allston]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Allston wanted Morse to accompany him to England to meet the artist [[Benjamin West]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Allston arranged — with Morse's father — a three-year stay for painting study in England</span>
				<span class='text'>The two men set sail aboard the ''Lybia'' on July 15, 1811</span>
				<span class='text'>n England, Morse perfected his painting techniques under Allston's watchful eye; by the end of 1811, he gained admittance to the [[Royal Academy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>At the Academy, he was moved by the art of the [[Renaissance]] and paid close attention to the works of [[Michelangelo]] and [[Raphael]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After observing and practicing [[Figure drawing|life drawing]] and absorbing its anatomical demands, the young artist produced his masterpiece, the ''Dying Hercules''</span>
				<span class='text'>(He first made a sculpture as a study for the painting</span>
				<span class='text'>[[File:DyingHercules</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|''Dying [[Hercules]]'', Morse's early masterpiece</span>
				<span class='text'>]To some, the ''Dying Hercules'' seemed to represent a political statement against the British and also the [[Federalist Party|American Federalists]]</span>
				<span class='text'> The muscles symbolized the strength of the young and vibrant United States versus the British and British-American supporters</span>
				<span class='text'>During Morse's time in Britain, the Americans and British were engaged in the [[War of 1812]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Both societies were conflicted over loyalties</span>
				<span class='text'>Anti-Federalist Americans aligned themselves with the French, abhorred the British, and believed a strong central government to be inherently dangerous to democracy</span>
				<span class='text'>s the war raged on, Morse's letters to his parents became more anti-Federalist in tone</span>
				<span class='text'>In one such letter, Morse wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I assert that the Federalists in the Northern States have done more injury to their country by their violent opposition measures than a French alliance could</span>
				<span class='text'>Their proceedings are copied into the English papers, read before [[British Parliament|Parliament]], and circulated through their country, and what do they say of them</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>they call them [Federalists] cowards, a base set, say they are traitors to their country and ought to be hanged like traitors</span>

				<span class='text'>Oil on canvas, 1828, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]Although Jedidiah Morse did not change Samuel's political views, he continued as an influence</span>
				<span class='text'> Critics believe that the elder Morse's Calvinist ideas are integral to Morse's ''Judgment of Jupiter,'' another significant work completed in England</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] is shown in a cloud, accompanied by his [[eagle]], with his hand spread above the parties and he is pronouncing judgment</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Marpessa]], with an expression of compunction and shame, is throwing herself into the arms of her husband</span>
				<span class='text'>Idas, who tenderly loved Marpessa, is eagerly rushing forward to receive her, while [[Apollo]] stares with surprise</span>
				<span class='text'>ritics have suggested that Jupiter represents God's omnipotence — watching every move that is made</span>
				<span class='text'>Some call the portrait a moral teaching by Morse on [[infidelity]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Marpessa fell victim, she realized that her [[eternal salvation]] was important and desisted from her wicked ways</span>
				<span class='text'>Apollo shows no remorse for what he did, but stands with a puzzled look</span>
				<span class='text'>Many American paintings throughout the early nineteenth century had religious themes, and Morse was an early exemplar of this</span>
				<span class='text'>''Judgment of Jupiter'' allowed Morse to express his support of Anti-Federalism while maintaining his strong spiritual convictions</span>
				<span class='text'>Benjamin West sought to present the ''Jupiter'' at another Royal Academy exhibition, but Morse's time had run out</span>
				<span class='text'>He left England on August 21, 1815, to return to the United States and begin his full-time career as a painter</span>
				<span class='text'>he decade 1815–1825 marked significant growth in Morse's work, as he sought to capture the essence of America's culture and life</span>

				<span class='text'>], Charleston, South Carolina for a short period</span>
				<span class='text'>]Morse also sought commissions among the elite of [[Charleston, South Carolina]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Morse's 1818 painting of Mrs</span>
				<span class='text'>Emma Quash symbolized the opulence of Charleston</span>
				<span class='text'>The young artist was doing well for himself</span>
				<span class='text'>Between 1819 and 1821, Morse went through great changes in his life, including a decline in commissions due to the [[Panic of 1819]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Unable to stop the rift within Calvinism, his father was forced to resign from his ministerial position, which he had held for three decades</span>
				<span class='text'> The new branch that formed was the Congregational Unitarians, Morse considered them to be anti-Federalists, as their beliefs were related to religious salvation</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough Samuel Morse respected his father's religious opinions, he sympathized with the [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Among the converts to Unitarianism were the prominent Pickerings of [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]], whom Morse had painted</span>
				<span class='text'> Some critics thought his sympathies represented his own anti-Federalism</span>
				<span class='text'>Morse was commissioned to paint President [[James Monroe]] in 1820</span>
				<span class='text'>He embodied Jeffersonian democracy by favoring the common man over the aristocrat</span>
				<span class='text'>orse had moved to [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]]</span>
				<span class='text'> His commissions for the ''Hall of Congress'' (1821) and a portrait of the [[Marquis de Lafayette]] (1825) engaged his sense of democratic nationalism</span>
				<span class='text'> The ''Hall of Congress'' was designed to capitalize on the success of François-Marius Granet's ''The Capuchin Chapel in Rome,'' which toured the United States extensively throughout the 1820s, attracting audiences willing to pay the 25-cent admission fee</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bellion|2011|p={{page needed|date=February 2014}} }}[[File:Samuel Finley Breeze Morse 001</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right |&lt;center&gt;''The Chapel of the Virgin at Subiaco,'' 1830&lt;/center&gt;]]The artist chose to paint the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], in a similar way, with careful attention to architecture and dramatic lighting</span>
				<span class='text'> He also wished to select a uniquely American topic that would bring glory to the young nation</span>
				<span class='text'>His subject did just that, showing American democracy in action</span>
				<span class='text'> He traveled to [[Washington D</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>] to draw the architecture of the new Capitol, and placed eighty individuals within the painting</span>
				<span class='text'>He chose to portray a night scene, balancing the architecture of the Rotunda with the figures, and using lamplight to highlight the work</span>
				<span class='text'>Pairs of people, those who stood alone, individuals bent over their desks working, were each painted simply but with faces of character</span>
				<span class='text'>Morse chose nighttime to convey that Congress' dedication to the principles of democracy transcended day</span>
				<span class='text'>'The Hall of Congress'' failed to draw a crowd when exhibited in [[New York City]] in 1821</span>
				<span class='text'> By contrast, John Trumbull's ''Declaration of Independence'' had won popular acclaim the previous year</span>
				<span class='text'>Viewers may have felt that the architecture of ''The Hall of Congress'' overshadows the individuals, making it hard to appreciate the drama of what was happening</span>
				<span class='text'>orse was honored to paint the [[Marquis de Lafayette]], the leading French supporter of the [[American Revolution]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He felt compelled to paint a grand portrait of the man who helped to establish a free and independent America</span>
				<span class='text'>He features Lafayette against a magnificent sunset</span>
				<span class='text'> He has positioned Lafayette to the right of three pedestals: one has a bust of [[Benjamin Franklin]], another of [[George Washington]], and the third seems reserved for Lafayette</span>
				<span class='text'>A peaceful woodland landscape below him symbolized American tranquility and prosperity as it approached the age of fifty</span>
				<span class='text'>The developing friendship between Morse and Lafayette, and their discussions of the Revolutionary War, affected the artist after his return to New York City</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1826 he helped found the [[National Academy of Design]] in New York City</span>
				<span class='text'>He served as the Academy's President from 1826 to 1845 and again from 1861 to 1862</span>
				<span class='text'>rom 1830 to 1832, Morse traveled and studied in [[Europe]] to improve his painting skills, visiting [[Italy]], [[Switzerland]] and [[France]]</span>
				<span class='text'> During his time in Paris, he developed a friendship with the writer [[James Fennimore Cooper]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|McCullough|2011|p={{page needed|date=February 2014}} }} As a project, he painted miniature copies of 38 of the [[Louvre]]'s famous paintings on a single canvas (6&amp;nbsp;ft</span>
				<span class='text'>x 9&amp;nbsp;ft), which he entitled ''The Gallery of the Louvre</span>
				<span class='text'>'  He completed the work upon his return to the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>n a subsequent visit to Paris in 1839, Morse met [[Louis Daguerre]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He became interested in the latter's [[daguerreotype]]—the first practical means of [[photography]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Morse wrote a letter to the ''[[New York Observer]]'' describing the invention, which was published widely in the American press and provided a broad awareness of the new technology</span>

				<span class='text'>While Morse was painting, a horse messenger delivered a letter from his father that read, &quot;Your dear wife is [[convalescent]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The next day he received a letter from his father detailing his wife's sudden death</span>

				<span class='text'>It is still the standard for [[rhythmic]] transmission of data</span>
				<span class='text'>eanwhile, [[William Fothergill Cooke|William Cooke]] and Professor [[Charles Wheatstone]] had learned of the [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Wilhelm Weber]] and [[Carl Gauss]] electromagnetic telegraph in 1833</span>
				<span class='text'>They had reached the stage of launching a commercial telegraph prior to Morse, despite starting later</span>
				<span class='text'>In England, Cooke became fascinated by electrical telegraphy in 1836, four years after Morse</span>
				<span class='text'>Aided by his greater financial resources, Cooke abandoned his primary subject of [[anatomy]] and built a small electrical telegraph within three weeks</span>
				<span class='text'>Wheatstone also was experimenting with telegraphy and (most importantly) understood that a single large [[battery (electricity)|battery]] would not carry a telegraphic signal over long distances</span>
				<span class='text'>He theorized that numerous small batteries were far more successful and efficient in this task</span>
				<span class='text'>(Wheatstone was building on the primary research of [[Joseph Henry]], an American [[physicist]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Cooke and Wheatstone formed a partnership and patented the electrical telegraph in May 1837, and within a short time had provided the [[Great Western Railway]] with a {{convert|13|mi|km|0|sing=on}} stretch of telegraph</span>
				<span class='text'>However, within a few years, Cooke and Wheatstone's multiple-wire signaling method would be overtaken by Morse's cheaper method</span>
				<span class='text'>n an 1848 letter to a friend, Morse describes how vigorously he fought to be called the sole inventor of the electromagnetic [[telegraphy|telegraph]] despite the previous inventions</span>

				<span class='text'>His breakthrough came from the insights of Professor [[Leonard Gale]], who taught chemistry at [[New York University]] (he was a personal friend of [[Joseph Henry]])</span>
				<span class='text'>With Gale's help, Morse introduced extra circuits or [[relay]]s at frequent intervals, and was soon able to send a message through ten miles (16&amp;nbsp;km) of wire</span>

				<span class='text'>]===Litigation over telegraph patent===In the United States, Morse held his telegraph patent for many years, but it was both ignored and contested</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1853 ''[[O'Reilly v</span>
				<span class='text'>Morse|The Telegraph Patent case--O'Reilly v</span>
				<span class='text'>Morse--]]'' came before the [[U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Supreme Court]] where, after very lengthy investigation, [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Roger B</span>
				<span class='text'>Taney]] ruled that Morse had been the first to combine the [[battery (electricity)|battery]], [[electromagnetism]], the [[electromagnet]] and the correct battery configuration into a workable practical telegraph</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Standage|1998|p=172–173}} However, in spite of this clear ruling, Morse still received no official recognition from the [[United States government]]</span>
				<span class='text'>he Supreme Court did not accept all of Morse's claims</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''[[O'Reilly v</span>
				<span class='text'>Morse]]'' case has become widely known among patent lawyers because the Supreme Court explicitly denied Morse's claim 8&lt;ref&gt;Morse's actual language in his claim 8 was: &quot;Eighth</span>
				<span class='text'>I do not propose to limit myself to the specific machinery or parts of machinery described in the foregoing specification and claims, the essence of my invention being the use of the motive power of the electric or galvanic current, which I call electro-magnetism, however developed, for marking or printing intelligible characters, signs, or letters, at any distances, being a new application of that power of which I claim to be the first inventor or discoverer</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  for any and all use of the electromagnetic force for purposes of transmitting intelligible signals to any distance</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;The Supreme Court said: &quot;Professor Morse has not discovered that the electric or galvanic current will always print at a distance, no matter what may be the form of the machinery or mechanical contrivances through which it passes</span>
				<span class='text'>You may use electro-magnetism as a motive power, and yet not produce the described effect, that is, print at a distance intelligible marks or signs</span>
				<span class='text'>To produce that effect, it must be combined with, and passed through, and operate upon, certain complicated and delicate machinery, adjusted and arranged upon philosophical principles, and prepared by the highest mechanical skill</span>
				<span class='text'>And it is the high praise of Professor Morse, that he has been able, by a new combination of known powers, of which electro-magnetism is one, to discover a method by which intelligible marks or signs may be printed at a distance</span>
				<span class='text'>And for the method or process thus discovered, he is entitled to a patent</span>
				<span class='text'>But he has not discovered that the electro-magnetic current, used as motive power, in any other method, and with any other combination, will do as well</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt;The Supreme Court sustained, however, Morse's claim to such telecommunication when effectuated by means of Morse's inventive &quot;repeater&quot; apparatus</span>
				<span class='text'>This was an electrical circuit in which a cascade of many sets comprising a relay and a battery were connected in series, so that when each relay closed, it closed a circuit to cause the next battery to power the succeeding relay, as suggested in the accompanying figure</span>
				<span class='text'>This caused Morse's signal to pass along the cascade without degrading into noise as its amplitude decreased with the distance traveled</span>
				<span class='text'>(Each time the amplitude of the signal approaches the noise level, the repeater [in effect, a nonlinear amplifier] boosts the signal amplitude well above the noise level</span>
				<span class='text'>The Supreme Court thus held that Morse could properly claim a patent monopoly on the system or process of transmitting signals at any distance by means of the repeater circuitry indicated above, but he could not properly claim a monopoly over any and all uses of electromagnetic force to transmit signals</span>
				<span class='text'>The apparatus limitation in the former type of claim limited the patent monopoly to what Morse taught and gave the world</span>
				<span class='text'>The lack of that limitation in the latter type of claim (i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> claim 8) both gave Morse more than was commensurate with what he had contributed to society and discouraged the inventive efforts of others who might come up with different and/or better ways to send signals at a distance using the electromagnetic force</span>
				<span class='text'>he problem that Morse faced&lt;ref&gt;The Supreme Court said, &quot;The great difficulty in their way was the fact that the galvanic current, however strong in the beginning, became gradually weaker as it advanced on the wire; and was not strong enough to produce a mechanical effect, after a certain distance had been traversed</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; 56 U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>at 107</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and how he solved it is discussed in more detail in the article [[O'Reilly v</span>
				<span class='text'>Morse]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In summary, the solution, as the Supreme Court stated, was the repeater apparatus described in the preceding paragraphs</span>
				<span class='text'>he importance of this legal precedent in patent law cannot be overstated, as it became the foundation of the law governing the eligibility of computer program implemented inventions (as well as inventions implementing natural laws) to be granted patents</span>
