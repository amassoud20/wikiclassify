				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Early life and career==Born into a poverty-stricken [[peasant]] family in Strelkovka, Maloyaroslavsky Uyezd, Kaluga Governorate (now merged into the town of [[Zhukov (town)|Zhukov]] in [[Zhukovsky District, Kaluga Oblast|Zhukovsky District]] of [[Kaluga Oblast]] in modern-day [[Russia]]), Zhukov became an apprentice [[furrier]] in [[Moscow]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1915 the Army of the [[Russian Empire]] conscripted him; he served first in the 106th Reserve Cavalry Regiment (then called the 10th Dragoon Novgorod Regiment)</span>

				<span class='text'>He joined the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Bolshevik Party]] after the 1917 [[October Revolution]]; in Party circles his background of poverty became a significant asset</span>
				<span class='text'>After recovering from a serious case of [[typhus]] he fought in the [[Russian Civil War]] over the period 1918 to 1921, serving with the [[1st Cavalry Army]], among other formations</span>
				<span class='text'>He received the decoration of the [[Order of the Red Banner]] for his part in subduing the [[Tambov rebellion]] in 1921</span>

				<span class='text'>158 (1st part)&lt;/ref&gt;== Khalkhin Gol to Barbarossa ==In 1938, Zhukov was directed to command the First Soviet Mongolian Army Group, and saw action against Japan's [[Kwantung Army]] on the border between [[Mongolian People's Republic|Mongolia]] and the Japanese-controlled state of [[Manchukuo]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This campaign was an [[Soviet–Japanese Border Wars|undeclared war]] that lasted from 1938 to 1939</span>
				<span class='text'>What began as a routine border skirmish – with the Japanese testing the resolve of the Soviets to defend their territory – rapidly escalated into a full-scale war, with the Japanese pushing forward with an estimated 80,000 troops, 180 tanks and 450 aircraft</span>
				<span class='text'>hese events led to the strategically decisive [[Battle of Khalkhin Gol]] (Nomonhan)</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhukov requested major reinforcements, and on 20 August 1939, his &quot;Soviet Offensive&quot; commenced</span>
				<span class='text'>After a massive artillery barrage, nearly 500&lt;ref name=Coox&gt;[[#Coox|Coox]], p</span>
				<span class='text'>579&lt;/ref&gt; [[BT-5]] and [[BT-7]] tanks advanced, supported by over 500&lt;ref&gt;[[#Coox|Coox]], p</span>
				<span class='text'>590&lt;/ref&gt; fighters and bombers</span>
				<span class='text'>This was the [[Soviet Air Force]]'s first fighter-bomber operation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=c633&gt;[[#Coox|Coox]], p</span>
				<span class='text'>633&lt;/ref&gt; The offensive first appeared to be a typical conventional frontal attack</span>
				<span class='text'>However, two tank brigades were initially held back and then ordered to advance around on both flanks, supported by motorized artillery, infantry, and other tanks</span>
				<span class='text'>This daring and successful manoeuvre encircled the [[Sixth Army (Japan)|Japanese 6th Army]] and captured the enemy's vulnerable rear supply areas</span>
				<span class='text'>By 31 August 1939, the Japanese had been cleared from the disputed border, leaving the Soviets clearly victorious</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=c633/&gt;This campaign had significance beyond the immediate tactical and local outcome</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhukov demonstrated and tested the techniques later used against the Germans in the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front of the Second World War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>These innovations included the deployment of [[underwater bridge]]s&lt;ref name=&quot;Coox, p</span>
				<span class='text'>998&quot;&gt;[[#Coox|Coox]], p</span>
				<span class='text'>998&lt;/ref&gt; and improving the cohesion and battle-effectiveness of inexperienced units by adding a few experienced, battle-hardened troops to bolster morale and overall training</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[#Coox|Coox]], p</span>
				<span class='text'>991&lt;/ref&gt; Evaluation of the problems inherent in the performance of the BT tanks led to the replacement of their fire-prone petrol (gasoline) engines with [[diesel engine]]s, and provided extremely valuable practical knowledge that was essential to the success in development of the [[T-34]] medium tank, widely considered the most outstanding all-around general purpose tank of World War II</span>
				<span class='text'>After this campaign, Nomonhan veterans were transferred to units that had not seen action, to better spread the benefits of their battle experience</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Coox, p</span>
				<span class='text'>998&quot;/&gt;For his victory, Zhukov was declared a [[Hero of the Soviet Union]]</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the campaign – and especially Zhukov's pioneering use of tanks – remained little known outside of the Soviet Union itself</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhukov considered Nomonhan invaluable preparation for conducting operations during the Second World War</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[#Coox|Coox]], p</span>

				<span class='text'>tm]&lt;/ref&gt; He reported that two exercises were done, one on 2–6 January 1941 (for the North-West direction), another on 8–11 January 1941 (for the South-West direction)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bobylev&quot;/&gt; Conditions of the first one explained that &quot;Western&quot; forces have attacked &quot;Eastern&quot; on 15 July, but &quot;Eastern&quot; forces counterattacked and by 1 August have reached the original border</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bobylev&quot;/&gt;At that time (start of the exercise), &quot;Eastern&quot; forces had a numerical advantage (for example, 51 infantry division against 41, 8811 tanks against 3512), with exception of anti-tank guns</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bobylev&quot;/&gt; Bolylev describes that by the end of the exercise the &quot;Eastern&quot; forces did not manage to surround and destroy the &quot;Western&quot; forces, which, in their turn, threatened to surround the &quot;Eastern&quot; forces themselves</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bobylev&quot;/&gt; The same historian reported that the second game was won by the &quot;Easterners&quot;, meaning that on the whole, both games were won by the side commanded by Zhukov</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bobylev&quot;/&gt; However, he noted that the games had a serious disadvantage since they did not consider the initial attack by &quot;Western&quot; forces, but only a (later) attack by &quot;Eastern&quot; forces from the initial border</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bobylev&quot;/&gt;According to Marshal [[Aleksandr Vasilevsky]], the war-game defeat of Pavlov's Red Troops against Zhukov was not known widely, but the victory of Zhukov's Red Troops against Kulik was widely propagandized, which created a popular illusion about easy success for a preemptive offensive</span>

				<span class='text'>]On 22 June 1941, Germany launched [[Operation Barbarossa]], an invasion of the Soviet Union</span>
				<span class='text'>On the same day, Zhukov responded by signing the &quot;Directive of Peoples' Commissariat of Defence No</span>
				<span class='text'>3&quot;, which ordered an all-out counteroffensive by Red Army forces: he commanded the troops &quot;to encircle and destroy [the] enemy grouping near [[Suwałki]] and to seize the Suwałki region by the evening of 24 June&quot; and &quot;to encircle and destroy the enemy grouping invading in [the] Vladimir-Volynia and Brody direction&quot; and even &quot;to seize the [[Lublin]] region by the evening of 24 June&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Thus they would not strike directly at [[Moscow]], but at more vulnerable Soviet positions</span>
				<span class='text'>From these conclusions, Zhukov suggested an audacious plan: moving the troops guarding the west of the [[Moskva River]] to the Central Front</span>
				<span class='text'>He advocated abandoning Kiev, and retreating to the East of the [[Dnepr River]] to avoid encirclement and destruction</span>
				<span class='text'>The Western Front would clear the German forces at the [[Yelnya]] salient, preventing the Germans from using Yelnya as a bridgehead for a Moscow offensive</span>

				<span class='text'>307&lt;/ref&gt;However, Stalin wouldn't approve the abandonment of Kiev</span>
				<span class='text'>On the night of July 29, during a violent argument, Stalin stated that the reasoning for abandoning Kiev was &quot;nonsense</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Despite knowing of Stalin's hot-headed temperament, Zhukov replied angrily: &quot;If you think the Chief of the General Staff talks nonsense, then I have no business here</span>
				<span class='text'>I ask that you relieve me from the post of Chief of the General Staff and send me to the front</span>
				<span class='text'>There, apparently, I shall be of greater use to the country</span>

				<span class='text'>43&lt;/ref&gt; However, Stalin kept Zhukov as a member of the Soviet High Command [[Stavka]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Arriving at his new post, Zhukov commanded the Reserve Front on the successful [[Yelnya Offensive]], inflicting heavy casualties and clearing the Germans from Yelnya</span>
				<span class='text'>The German casualties included the powerful and well-equipped ''Grossdeutschland'' regiment, which was almost annihilated</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=T307/&gt;While commanding the Reserve Front, Zhukov tracked events on other fronts</span>

				<span class='text'>Zhukov sent Stalin a [[telegram]] predicting that the Germans would assault the rear of the Southwestern Front, with the aim of encircling it (in what the Germans called a ''&quot;{{lang|de|Kesselschlacht}}&quot;'' or &quot;cauldron battle&quot;) and destroying it</span>
				<span class='text'>This, he predicted, would secure the southern flank of German Center Army Group, and would enable the Germans to attack [[Donbass]]</span>
				<span class='text'>If the Soviet troops were defeated, and German gains consolidated, the bulk of the German army would be able to attack Moscow in strength</span>

				<span class='text'>Stalin told his staff, at a meeting with his military commanders, &quot;Leningrad may be lost—the situation is hopelessly bad there</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Zhukov was present and was summoned by Stalin for a private discussion that had a significant impact on the course of the war</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhukov and Stalin agreed that Leningrad and its surrounding territory were absolutely critical to avoid losing the war, and therefore, that ''everything'' became strategically related to the defense of Leningrad and given first priority—including the Red Army and Navy operations in Karelia and Northern Russia, partisan guerrilla resistance in [[Novgorod]] and the Leningrad area, control over [[Lake Ladoga]] and the [[Svir River]], the seaports of [[Murmansk]] and [[Arkhangelsk]] that were receiving significant British, Canadian, and American help through [[Arctic convoys]], and the evacuation of civilians, millions of whom were trapped in the encircled city and its suburbs</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=memoir&gt;[[#Zhukov|Zhukov]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Carell]] (1966), Verbrannte Erde: Schlacht zwischen Wolga und Weichsel (Scorched Earth: The Russian-German War 1943–1944), Verlag Ullstein GmbH, (Schiffer Publishing),&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Werth (1964) ''Russia at War 1941–1945''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harrison Salisbury (1969; 2003) ''The 900 Days: the Siege of Leningrad'', Da Capo Press, ISBN 0306812983</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Stalin ordered Zhukov to save Leningrad by any means, because if the city fell, 11% of the national economy and the invaluable wealth of the [[Hermitage Museum]] and the palaces of the Russian [[tsar]]s from [[Peter the Great]] onwards would be in the hands of the enemy</span>
				<span class='text'>German forces could unite with the small, but tough, motivated and skilled Finnish forces</span>
				<span class='text'>These combined forces could quite possibly drive through Northern Russia and attack Moscow, which might well win the war for Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>t that time, German forces had already cut the important Moscow railroad, and the Finnish forces north of Leningrad had attacked and obliterated the roads connecting Leningrad to the [[logistics|logistically]] important seaports of Murmansk and Arkhangelsk</span>
				<span class='text'>These developments had potentially dire consequences for both Leningrad and Moscow, which were highly dependent on the British, Canadian and American supplies</span>
				<span class='text'>On 10 September 1941, following the encirclement of Leningrad, Zhukov was made the commander of the [[Leningrad Front]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[#Zhukov|Zhukov]], p</span>
				<span class='text'>382 (1st part)&lt;/ref&gt;In an important clandestine surveillance operation, Zhukov and his staff flew over Lake Ladoga and landed on the partially destroyed airstrip of [[Rzhevka Airport]], in Leningrad</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhukov found the huge city and its suburbs, which had a population of 3</span>
				<span class='text'> million, flooded by 460,000 refugees from the Nazi-occupied provinces</span>
				<span class='text'>Shortages of food and munitions were critical, and the situation as a whole was dire</span>
				<span class='text'>In order to save this strategically and psychologically important city and its important Navy base, Zhukov had to accomplish three tasks:# Stop the offensive before it entered Leningrad city proper# Protect the civilians that were fleeing the besieged city and its suburbs# Reorganize the joint command and civilian resistance to prepare for a lengthy siegeZhukov ordered the executions of several inadequate officers, thus strengthening the siege perimeter</span>
				<span class='text'>To bolster resistance, Zhukov organized a special armed regiment that was empowered to shoot anyone who retreated from the perimeter</span>
				<span class='text'>He also ordered the laying of dense minefields and the deployment of artillery batteries in all critical directions, and redeployed some fifty thousand Navy men from the [[Baltic Fleet]], creating additional infantry and helping to reinforce the regular land-based contingents</span>
				<span class='text'>uring the period September through October, Zhukov launched a series of attacks and counterattacks, with the purpose of harassing and wearing out the German and Finnish forces who held the siege perimeter to the south and north</span>
				<span class='text'>One of these deadly counteroffensives stopped the enemy forces after they had penetrated the defense lines near the seaport of Leningrad, just two miles from the [[Kirov Plant]] which was building [[Kliment Voroshilov tank|KV]] heavy tanks</span>
				<span class='text'>With intense fire support from land- and sea-based artillery batteries, the counteroffensive effectively stopped the attack in that sector</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[#Tham|Thâm]], pp</span>
				<span class='text'>309–311&lt;/ref&gt;Zhukov's brutal and unceasing efforts produced results—the attack was stopped in its tracks, and the fierce battle was transformed into a deadly siege</span>
				<span class='text'>The city was saved, and thus [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s plan to win the war outright using this strategy failed</span>
				<span class='text'>An outraged Hitler—together with [[Wilhelm Keitel]]—visited Finland on 4 June 1942, meeting with Finnish president [[Ryti]] and the commander of the armed forces of Germany's (nominal) ally Finland ([[Mannerheim]]), after which they renewed their joint attack on Leningrad</span>
				<span class='text'>Subsequently, Mannerheim again visited with ''Führer'' Hitler and members of his top leadership (including ''Reichsführer SS'' [[Heinrich Himmler]] and ''Reichsmarschall'' and ''Luftwaffe'' Commander [[Hermann Göring]]) in Germany on 27–28 June about the situation</span>
				<span class='text'>However, all sides in this battle were exhausted by this time, lacking the combat power, equipment, and logistics to push the campaign to a decisive conclusion</span>
				<span class='text'>The battle of Leningrad lasted until January 1944, making it the single most deadly and one of the most cruel sieges in human history</span>
				<span class='text'>hukov was present in the city during only parts of the siege, secretly flying in and out when he and Stalin felt his presence was absolutely required</span>
				<span class='text'>He nevertheless constantly oversaw the efforts against the Wehrmacht's 900-day-long siege and its related operations, including defensive preparations and operations, the evacuation of about 1</span>
				<span class='text'> million civilians, the movement of various important industries and their equipment and materials away from the city and reorganizing the entire front after the failure of the [[2nd Shock Army]] in 1942, [[Operation Iskra]] in 1943, the [[Leningrad–Novgorod Offensive]] in 1944 and other operations around the besieged city</span>

				<span class='text'>Budyonny]], wasn't even present at headquarters and the officers in the High Command didn't seem to know what was happening at the front</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=T311&gt;[[#Tham|Thâm]], pp</span>
				<span class='text'>311–313&lt;/ref&gt; To unify the operations of the huge numbers of Soviet forces, he sent a suggestion to Stalin that the Reserve and the Western Fronts be merged</span>
				<span class='text'>After that, Zhukov became the ''de facto'' leader of the forces defending the Soviet capital city</span>
				<span class='text'>fter a brief period, Zhukov established communication links with the encircled Soviet troops of the Western Front</span>
				<span class='text'>After analyzing the situation and pointing out strengths and weaknesses of the German troops surrounding them, he gave specific instructions to their commanders and political personnel</span>
				<span class='text'>Unable to break the ''Kessel'' (''Ger</span>
				<span class='text'>' &quot;kettle&quot;, or encirclement area), the surrounded Soviet troops did manage to strengthen their positions under Zhukov's leadership</span>
				<span class='text'>Their efforts to some extent wore out some German units and thereby reduced the overall striking power of the offensive</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=T311/&gt;On 15 November, the Germans launched another attack on Moscow</span>
				<span class='text'>At Krasnaya Polyana (Красная поляна) and Kryukovo (Крюково), northwest of the capital, the Germans advanced to about 20&amp;nbsp;km from Moscow</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Zhukov recognized an important error in the German plan—while the German forces seemed to attack aggressively from both their flanks, those in the center remained relatively inactive</span>
				<span class='text'>From this observation, Zhukov made a rather daring decision: he ordered the repositioning of many of his centrally located battle forces to reinforce his two flanks</span>
				<span class='text'>With this tactical change, the Soviets stopped several German attacks with few losses among their reserve troops</span>
				<span class='text'>Later on, these better-rested reserve forces played an important role in the counteroffensive</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=T311/&gt;Zhukov reasoned that the Germans would realize that this tactical scheme was problematic and would begin to attack in the now-weakened center</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhukov therefore ordered the remaining forces in the center to prepare for an offensive</span>
				<span class='text'>Just as he had predicted, the Germans began to attack the central sector troops</span>
				<span class='text'>The Soviet preparations, however, managed to stop the German offensive</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=T311/&gt;After intense fighting, Moscow remained under Soviet control, while the German forces were exhausted and had lost equipment and supplies, a critical weakness given the long [[logistics|logistical]] tail</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;On February 1953, Stalin ordered Zhukov to leave the post of commander of the [[Urals Military District]], and then recalled him to Moscow</span>
				<span class='text'>Several opinions suggested Zhukov was needed for [[Korean War]] service; but, in fact, during one month at Moscow, Stalin did not give Zhukov any tasks</span>

				<span class='text'>on 5 March 1953, Stalin suddenly died</span>
				<span class='text'>After this event, Zhukov's life entered a new phase</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Axell, p</span>
				<span class='text'>356&quot;/&gt;===Reasons for Zhukov's rises and falls under Stalin===During the Great Patriotic War, Zhukov was one of only a few people who understood Stalin's personality</span>
				<span class='text'>As the Chief of Staff and later Deputy Supreme Commander, Zhukov had hundreds of meetings with Stalin, both private and during [[Stavka]] conferences</span>
				<span class='text'>Consequently, Zhukov well understood Stalin's personality and methods</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Zhukov, Stalin was a strong and secretive person, but he was also hot-tempered and skeptical</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhukov was even able to gauge Stalin's mood; for example, when Stalin drew deeply on his tobacco pipe, it was a sign of a good mood</span>
				<span class='text'>Conversely, if Stalin failed to light his pipe once it was out of tobacco, it was a sign of an imminent outburst</span>

				<span class='text'>Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>2, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>139, 150</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; An outstanding knowledge of Stalin's personality was very helpful to Zhukov, and it assisted him to deal with Stalin's rages in a way other generals could not</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[#Axell|Axell]], p</span>
				<span class='text'>280&lt;/ref&gt; Both Zhukov and Stalin were hot-tempered, and, at different times, one of them made concessions in order to sustain their relationship</span>
				<span class='text'>hile Zhukov simply viewed his relationship with Stalin as one of subordinate–senior, Stalin was in awe and possibly jealous of Zhukov</span>
				<span class='text'>Both were military commanders; but, whilst Stalin's experience was restricted to a previous generation of non-mechanised warfare, by contrast, Zhukov was highly influential in the development of contemporary combined operations of highly mechanised armies</span>
				<span class='text'>The differences in these outlooks were responsible for many tempestuous disagreements between the two of them at Soviet Stavka meetings</span>
				<span class='text'>Nonetheless, Zhukov was less competent than Stalin as a politician, an inadequacy which accounted for Zhukov's many failures in Soviet politics</span>
				<span class='text'>In fact, Stalin's unwillingness to value Zhukov beyond the marshal's military talents was one of the reasons why Stalin recalled Zhukov from Berlin</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Chaney/&gt;Another significant element of their relationship was Zhukov's straightforwardness toward Stalin</span>
				<span class='text'>Stalin was dismissive of the fawning of many of his entourage and openly criticised it</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[#Shtemenko|Shtemenko]], Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>2 p</span>
				<span class='text'>587&lt;/ref&gt;Many people around Stalin — such as Beria, Yezhov, Mekhlis, and some others — felt the need to flatter Stalin to remain on his good side</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[#Vasilevsky|Vasilevsky]], p</span>
				<span class='text'>62&lt;/ref&gt; Zhukov was different</span>
				<span class='text'>By contrast, he was stubbornly willing to express his views, often going openly against Stalin's opinion even to the point of risking his career</span>
				<span class='text'>His heated argument with Stalin on the subject of abandoning Kiev in 1941 was a typical example of Zhukov's approach</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This independence in Zhukov's thinking gained Stalin's respect</span>
				<span class='text'>It caused Zhukov considerable difficulties on occasions, but was the main reason the decision-making of Stavka become more objective and effective</span>
				<span class='text'>After the war, things were less successful for Zhukov, and his independent-mindedness caused him many problems</span>
				<span class='text'>Indeed, under the personality cult of the Stalinist regime and its overweening bureaucracy and emphasis on conformity, there was little place within the government for people like Zhukov</span>

				<span class='text'>Malenkov and his allies attempted to purge Stalin's influence and personality cult; however, Malenkov himself did not have the courage to do this alone</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, Lavrentiy Beria remained dangerous</span>
				<span class='text'>The politicians sought reinforcement from the powerful and prestigious military men</span>
				<span class='text'>In this matter, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] chose Zhukov because the two had forged a good relationship, and, in addition, in the Great Patriotic War, Zhukov had twice saved Khrushchev from false accusations</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;On 26 June 1953, a special meeting of the Soviet [[Politburo]] was held by Malenkov</span>
				<span class='text'>Beria came to the meeting with an uneasy feeling because it was called hastily—indeed, Zhukov had ordered General [[Kirill Moskalenko]] to secretly prepare a special force and permitted the force to use two of Zhukov's and Bulganin's special cars (which had black glass) in order to safely infiltrate the [[Kremlin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhukov also ordered him to replace the [[NKVD]] Guard by the guard of the Moscow Military District</span>
				<span class='text'>In this meeting, Khrushchev, Malenkov and their allies denounced &quot;the imperialist element Beria&quot; about his &quot;anti-Party&quot;, &quot;anti-socialist&quot; activities, &quot;sowing division&quot;, and  &quot;acting as a spy of England&quot;, together with many other crimes</span>

				<span class='text'>Immediately, the prepared special force rushed in</span>

				<span class='text'>Zhukov and most of the Presidium were not, however, eager to see a full-scale intervention in Hungary</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhukov even recommended the withdrawal of Soviet troops when it seemed that they might have to take extreme measures to suppress the revolution</span>
				<span class='text'>The mood in the Presidium changed again when Hungary's new Prime Minister, [[Imre Nagy]], began to talk about Hungarian withdrawal from the [[Warsaw Pact]]</span>
				<span class='text'>That led the Soviets to attack the revolutionaries and to replace Nagy with [[János Kádár]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In the same years, when the UK, France and Israel invaded Egypt during the [[Suez crisis]], Zhukov expressed support for Egypt's right of self-defense</span>
				<span class='text'>In October 1957, Zhukov visited Yugoslavia and [[Albania]] aboard the [[Chapayev-class cruiser]] ''Kuibyshev'', attempting to repair the [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]]–Stalin split of 1948</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[#Spahr|Spahr]], pp</span>

				<span class='text'>He further became a symbol of national strength</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhukov's prestige was even higher than the police and security agencies of the USSR, and thus rekindled concerns among political leaders</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, going even further than Khrushchev, Zhukov demanded that the political agencies in the Red Army report to him before the Party</span>
				<span class='text'>He demanded an official condemnation of Stalin's crimes during the [[Great Purge]] {{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}</span>

				<span class='text'>In response his opponents accused him of being a Reformist and [[Bonapartism (Marxism)|Bonapartist]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Such enviousness and hostility proved to be the key factor that led to his later downfall</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[#Spahr|Spahr]], p</span>
				<span class='text'>391&lt;/ref&gt;The relationship between Zhukov and Khrushchev reached its peak during the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|XX Congress of the Communist Party]] (1956)</span>
				<span class='text'>After becoming the First Secretary of the Party, Khrushchev moved against Stalin's legacy, criticizing his &quot;personality cult&quot;, and had Stalin's body moved out of his mausoleum to the [[Kremlin Wall Necropolis]] (as had other Soviet leaders)</span>
				<span class='text'>To complete such startling acts, Khrushchev needed the approval—or at least the acquiescence—of the military, headed by Minister of Defense Zhukov</span>
				<span class='text'>At the Central Conference of the Communist Party held in June 1957, the conservative [[Stalinist]]s led by Malenkov and [[Nikolai Bulganin]] tried to remove Khrushchev by using a mechanical voting majority—with a draft of a resolution about dismissing Khrushchev</span>
				<span class='text'>The coup failed and the strongest supporter of Khrushchev was none other than Zhukov</span>
				<span class='text'>At that Central Conference, Zhukov personally stated:{{quote|The Army went against this resolution and not even a tank will leave its position without my order!|G</span>

				<span class='text'>453-455&lt;/ref&gt;==Retirement==After being forced out of the government, Zhukov stayed away from politics</span>
				<span class='text'>Many people—including former subordinates—frequently paid him visits, joined him on hunting excursions, and waxed nostalgic</span>
				<span class='text'>In September 1959, while visiting the [[United States]], Khrushchev told US President Eisenhower that the retired Marshal Zhukov &quot;liked fishing&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Eisenhower, in response, sent Zhukov a set of fishing tackle</span>

				<span class='text'>Zhukov's name was put in the public eye yet again when Brezhnev lionized Zhukov in a speech commemorating the Great Patriotic War</span>
				<span class='text'>On 9 May 1965, Zhukov was invited to sit on the tribunal of the Lenin Mausoleum and given the honor to review the parade of military forces in [[Red Square]]</span>

				<span class='text'>His memoirs were published in 1969 and became a best-seller</span>
				<span class='text'>Within several months of the date of publication of his memoirs, Zhukov had received more than 10,000 letters from readers that offered comments, expressed gratitude, gave advice, or lavished praise</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Zhukov was critical of the role the Soviet leadership played during the war</span>
				<span class='text'>The first edition of {{Lang|ru|''Vospominaniya i razmyshleniya''}}, was published during the reign of Leonid Brezhnev only on the conditions that criticism of Stalin was removed, and that Zhukov add a (fictional) episode of a visit to Leonid Brezhnev, ''[[politruk]]'' at the Southern Front, to consult on [[military strategy]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===In popular culture===* Zhukov is a character in [[Robert Conroy]]'s ''Red Inferno: 1945''</span>
				<span class='text'>The novel follows his career as Marshal of the Soviet Union in a fictional situation where the Soviet Union attacks America and the remaining Allied nations</span>
				<span class='text'>Toward the end of the novel an American [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] drops a nuclear bomb near the city of [[Paderborn]], Germany, where Zhukov has set up his headquarters</span>
				<span class='text'>This fictional bomb kills both him and his protégé and second in command, [[Vasily Chuikov]], as well as a large portion of the elite forces of the Soviet military</span>
				<span class='text'> The PC Game, ''[[Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert]]'', set in an alternate history, features a bumbling, incompetent Soviet commander named Georgi Kukov, a humorous caricature of Georgi Zhukov</span>
				<span class='text'> In the title song in the Swedish band [[Sabaton (band)|Sabaton]]'s album ''[[Attero Dominatus]]'' includes a strain about Georgy Zhukov during the Battle of Berlin as well as a line referring to him</span>
				<span class='text'>The line being, &quot;Marshal Zhukov's orders: Serve me Berlin on a plate&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'> The Cigar City Brewing Company in [[Tampa, Florida]], brews a [[Russian imperial stout]] named after Zhukov</span>
				<span class='text'> The [[Starfleet|USS]] ''Zhukov'', an ''Ambassador''-class [[starship]], is referred to several times in ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]</span>
				<span class='text'>'* Alternate history writer [[Harry Turtledove]] uses Zhukov in several of his novels, including the novel ''[[The Man With the Iron Heart]]'', the epic ''[[Worldwar]]'', the series ''[[The War That Came Early]]'', and some short stories</span>
				<span class='text'>In virtually all Turtledove timelines, Zhukov is killed several decades before his historic death, usually either by the Nazis or by his own unforgiving boss Stalin</span>
				<span class='text'> In the [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] TV series ''[[The Americans (2013 TV series)|The Americans]]'', a [[KGB]] man named Zhukov, a hero of the Great Patriotic War, is the mentor and commander of [[Elizabeth Jennings (The Americans)|Elizabeth Jennings]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Zhukov is mentioned a number of times in the [[Martin Amis]] novel [[The Zone of Interest]], including the statement that he had given [[Erich von Manstein]] a &quot;mauling&quot; west of [[Stalingrad]], during the [[Battle of Stalingrad]]</span>
