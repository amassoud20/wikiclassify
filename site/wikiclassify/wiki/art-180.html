				<span class='text'>He described his experiences as a slave in his 1845 autobiography, ''[[Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave]]'', which became a bestseller, and was influential in promoting the cause of abolition, as was his second book, ''[[My Bondage and My Freedom]]'' (1855)</span>

				<span class='text'>First published in 1881 and revised in 1892, three years before his death, it covered events during and after the Civil War</span>
				<span class='text'>Douglass also actively supported [[women's suffrage]], and held several public offices</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=VP/&gt;A firm believer in the [[Egalitarianism|equality]] of all peoples, whether [[African Americans|black]], [[Woman|female]], Native American, or recent [[Immigration to the United States|immigrant]], Douglass famously said, &quot;I would unite with anybody to do right and with nobody to do wrong</span>

				<span class='text'>For about six months, their study went relatively unnoticed</span>
				<span class='text'>While Freeland remained complacent about their activities, other plantation owners became incensed about their slaves being educated</span>

				<span class='text'>Thomas Auld sent Douglass to work for [[Edward Covey]], a poor farmer who had a reputation as a &quot;slave-breaker</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He whipped Douglass regularly, and nearly broke him psychologically</span>

				<span class='text'>ng|thumb|right|Frederick Douglass circa 1847–52</span>
				<span class='text'>]Douglass's best-known work is his first autobiography ''[[Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave]]'', published in 1845</span>
				<span class='text'>At the time, some skeptics questioned whether a black man could have produced such an eloquent piece of literature</span>
				<span class='text'>The book received generally positive reviews and became an immediate bestseller</span>
				<span class='text'>Within three years, it had been reprinted nine times, with 11,000 copies circulating in the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>It was also translated into French and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and published in Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>ouglass published three versions of his autobiography during his lifetime (and revised the third of these), each time expanding on the previous one</span>
				<span class='text'>The 1845 ''Narrative'' was his biggest seller, and probably allowed him to raise the funds to gain his legal freedom the following year, as discussed below</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1855, Douglass published ''[[My Bondage and My Freedom]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1881, after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Douglass published ''[[Life and Times of Frederick Douglass]]'', which he revised in 1892</span>
				<span class='text'>==Travels to Ireland and Britain===Douglass' friends and mentors feared that the publicity would draw the attention of his ex-owner, Hugh Auld, who might try to get his &quot;property&quot; back</span>
				<span class='text'>They encouraged Douglass to tour Ireland, as many former slaves had done</span>
				<span class='text'>Douglass set sail on the ''Cambria'' for [[Liverpool]] on August 16, 1845</span>
				<span class='text'>He traveled in Ireland as the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Potato Famine]] was beginning</span>
				<span class='text'>he feeling of freedom from American racial discrimination amazed Douglass:&lt;blockquote&gt;Eleven days and a half gone and I have crossed three thousand miles of the perilous deep</span>

				<span class='text'>quot; The AME Church and ''North Star'' vigorously opposed the mostly white [[American Colonization Society]] and its proposal to send blacks back to Africa</span>
				<span class='text'>This and Douglass's later abolitionist newspapers were mainly funded by English supporters, who gave Douglass five hundred pounds to use as he chose</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ruuth&quot;/&gt; Douglass also soon split with Garrison, perhaps because the ''North Star'' competed with Garrison's ''[[National Anti-Slavery Standard]]'' and Marius Robinson's ''Anti-Slavery Bugle''</span>
				<span class='text'>ouglass also came to consider Garrison too radical</span>
				<span class='text'>Earlier Douglass had agreed with Garrison's position that the Constitution was pro-slavery, because of its compromises related to apportionment of Congressional seats, based on partial counting of slave populations with state totals; and protection of the international slave trade through 1807</span>
				<span class='text'>Garrison had burned copies of the Constitution to express his opinion</span>
				<span class='text'>But, [[Lysander Spooner]] published ''[[The Unconstitutionality of Slavery]]'' (1846), which explored the [[United States Constitution]] as an anti-slavery document</span>
				<span class='text'>Douglass's change of opinion about the Constitution and his splitting from Garrison around 1847 became one of the abolitionist movement's most notable divisions</span>
				<span class='text'>Douglass angered Garrison by saying that the Constitution could and should be used as an instrument in the fight against slavery</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Also in the wake of the Seneca Falls Convention, Douglass used an editorial spot in his paper, The North Star, to press the case for women's rights in this public venue</span>
				<span class='text'>The article was two-fold: it recalled the &quot;marked ability and dignity&quot; of the proceedings and briefly conveyed several arguments of the convention and feminist thought at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>n the first count, Douglass acknowledged the &quot;decorum&quot; of the participants in the face of disagreement</span>
				<span class='text'>The latter half discussed the primary document that emerged from the conference, a Declaration of Sentiments, and his own discussion of the &quot;infant&quot; feminist cause</span>
				<span class='text'>Strikingly, he expressed the belief that &quot;[a] discussion of the rights of animals would be regarded with far more complacency…than would be a discussion of the rights of women,&quot; and Douglass noted the link between abolitionism and feminism, the overlap between the communities</span>
				<span class='text'>is opinion as the prominent editor of the paper likely carried weight, and he stated the position of The North Star explicitly: &quot;[w]e hold woman to be justly entitled to all we claim for man</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; This letter, written a week after the convention, reaffirmed the first part of the paper's slogan, &quot;right is of no sex</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;Later, after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] when the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th Amendment]] to give freedmen and free blacks the right to vote was being debated, Douglass split with the Stanton-led faction of the women's rights movement</span>
				<span class='text'>Douglass supported the amendment, which would grant suffrage to black men</span>
				<span class='text'>Stanton opposed the 15th Amendment because it limited expansion of suffrage to black men; she predicted its passage would delay for decades the cause for women's right to vote</span>
				<span class='text'>Stanton argued that American women and black men should band together to fight for [[universal suffrage]], and opposed any bill which split the issues</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;DouglassO'Meally2003&quot;/&gt; Douglass and Stanton both knew that there was not yet enough male support for women's right to vote, but that an amendment giving black men the vote could pass in the late 1860s</span>
				<span class='text'>Stanton wanted to attach women's suffrage to that of black men so that her cause would be carried to success</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Douglass thought such a strategy was too risky, that there was barely enough support for black men's suffrage</span>
				<span class='text'>He feared that linking the cause of women's suffrage to that of black men would result in failure for both</span>
				<span class='text'>Douglass argued that white women, already empowered by their social connections to fathers, husbands, and brothers, at least vicariously had the vote</span>
				<span class='text'>African-American women, he believed, would have the same degree of empowerment as white women once African-American men had the vote</span>

				<span class='text'>This led Douglass to become an early advocate for school desegregation</span>
				<span class='text'>In the 1850s, Douglass observed that New York's facilities and instruction for African-American children were vastly inferior to those for whites</span>
				<span class='text'>Douglass called for court action to open all schools to all children</span>

				<span class='text'>The preaching of a white Methodist minister, named Hanson, was the means of causing me to feel that in God I had such a friend</span>
				<span class='text'>He thought that all men, great and small, bond and free, were sinners in the sight of God: that they were by nature rebels against His government; and that they must repent of their sins, and be reconciled to God through Christ</span>
				<span class='text'>I cannot say that I had a very distinct notion of what was required of me, but one thing I did know well: I was wretched and had no means of making myself otherwise</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;br /&gt;I consulted a good old colored man named Charles Lawson, and in tones of holy affection he told me to pray, and to &quot;cast all my care upon God</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;  This I sought to do; and though for weeks I was a poor, broken-hearted mourner, traveling through doubts and fears, I finally found my burden lightened, and my heart relieved</span>
				<span class='text'>I loved all mankind, slaveholders not excepted, though I abhorred slavery more than ever</span>
				<span class='text'>I saw the world in a new light, and my great concern was to have everybody converted</span>

				<span class='text'>In this sense, Douglass distinguished between the &quot;Christianity of Christ&quot; and the &quot;Christianity of America&quot; and considered religious slaveholders and clergymen who defended slavery as the most brutal, sinful, and cynical of all who represented &quot;wolves in sheep's clothing</span>

				<span class='text'>Delivered at Market Hall, New York City October 22, 1847&lt;/ref&gt;Notably, in a famous oration given in the Corinthian Hall of Rochester, he sharply criticized the attitude of religious people who kept silent about slavery, and held that religious ministers committed a ''[[blasphemy]]'' when they taught it as sanctioned by religion</span>
				<span class='text'>He considered that a law passed to support slavery was &quot;one of the grossest infringements of Christian Liberty&quot; and said that pro-slavery clergymen within the American Church &quot;stripped the love of God of its beauty, and leave the throne of religion a huge, horrible, repulsive form,&quot; and &quot;an abomination in the sight of God</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Of ministers like John Chase Lord, Leonard Elijah Lathrop, [[Ichabod Spencer]], and [[Orville Dewey]], he said that they taught, against the Scriptures, that &quot;we ought to obey man's law before the law of God&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He further asserted, &quot;in speaking of the American church, however, let it be distinctly understood that I mean the great mass of the religious organizations of our land</span>
				<span class='text'>There are exceptions, and I thank God that there are</span>

				<span class='text'>quot; In addition, he called religious people to embrace abolitionism, stating, &quot;let the religious press, the pulpit, the Sunday school, the conference meeting, the great ecclesiastical, missionary, Bible and tract associations of the land array their immense powers against slavery and slave-holding; and the whole system of crime and blood would be scattered to the winds</span>
