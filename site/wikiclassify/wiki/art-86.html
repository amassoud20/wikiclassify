				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;While [[Subotiv]] or [[Chyhyryn]] are most commonly identified as alternative places for his birth, historian [[Stanis≈Çaw BarƒÖcz]] believes that he was born in [[Zhovkva]] (''≈ª√≥≈Çkiew'')</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; His father, a [[courtier]] of [[Great Crown Hetman]] [[Stanis≈Çaw ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski]], was of noble birth and belonged to the [[Clan]] [[Massalski coat of arms|Massalski]], [[Abdank coat of arms|Abdank]] or [[Syrokomla coat of arms|Syrokomla]], but there has been controversy as to whether Bohdan belonged to the szlachta (Polish term for noblemen)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Whether Khmelnytsky was or was not a noble is still uncertain</span>
				<span class='text'>He claimed nobility when it suited him, and it was not often disputed by his contemporaries</span>
				<span class='text'>Khmelnytsky/Chmielnicki once wrote in a letter to King [[Jan Kazimierz]] that he was &quot;born Chmielnicki;&quot; however, that surname was never associated with the [[Abdank Coat of Arms]] hesed</span>
				<span class='text'>His father, a noble, was married to a [[Cossack]] woman and, according to the [[Polish Statute of 1505]], his mother's status might have prevented Bohdan from being considered a nobleman</span>
				<span class='text'>Other historians' theories suggest that his father or grandfather was stripped of noble status</span>
				<span class='text'>Most controversially, 19th-century Polish historian [[Tomasz Padura]] claimed (without giving sources) that Khmelnytsky's father was a [[Jewish]] convert to [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]] (and therefore not of the nobility)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Some sources state that in 1590 his father Mykhailo was appointed as a [[sotnyk]] for the Korsun-Chyhyryn starosta [[Jan Miko≈Çaj Dani≈Çowicz|Jan Dani≈Çowicz]], who continued to colonize the new Ukrainian lands near the [[Dnieper river]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bohdan Khmelnitsky&quot;&gt;[http://kraevid</span>
				<span class='text'>rg/lviv/history/personalities/hetmans/bohdan_khmelnytsky/ru/ Bohdan Khmelnitsky] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the above-mentioned-source, Mykhailo established [[Chyhyryn]] and later his own family estates of Subotiv (5 miles from Chyhyryn) and [[Novoseltsi]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Khmelnytsky identified as a noble, and his father's status as a deputy [[Starosta]] ([[Elder (administrative title)|elder]]) of Chyhyryn helped him to be considered as such by others</span>
				<span class='text'>During the Uprising, however, Khmelnytsky would stress his mother's [[Cossack]] roots and his father's exploits with the Cossacks of the [[Zaporizhian Sich|Sich]]</span>
				<span class='text'>hmelnytsky's early education cannot be documented</span>
				<span class='text'>Several historians believe he received his elementary schooling from a church clerk until he was sent to one of [[Kiev]]'s Orthodox fraternity schools</span>
				<span class='text'>He continued his education in [[Polish language|Polish]] at a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] college, possibly in [[Jaros≈Çaw]], but more likely in [[Lviv]], in the school founded by hetman ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski</span>
				<span class='text'>He completed his schooling by 1617, acquiring a broad knowledge of world history and learning Polish and [[Latin language|Latin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Later he learned [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Crimean Tatar language|Tatar]], and [[French language|French]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Unlike many of the other Jesuit students, he did not embrace [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] but remained [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==Service with the Cossacks==={{Cossacks}}Upon completion of his studies in 1617, Khmelnytsky entered into service with the Cossacks</span>
				<span class='text'>As early as 1619 he was sent together with his father to [[Moldavia]], when the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth entered into war against the [[Ottoman Empire]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His first military engagement was a tragic one</span>
				<span class='text'>During the [[Battle of ≈¢u≈£ora (1620)|battle of Cecora]] (≈¢u≈£ora) on 17 September 1620, his father was killed, and young Khmelnytsky, among many others including future hetman [[Stanis≈Çaw Koniecpolski]], was captured by the Turks</span>
				<span class='text'>He spent the next two years in captivity in [[Constantinople]] as a prisoner of an [[Ottoman Turks|Ottoman]] [[Kapudan Pasha]] (presumably [[Parlak Mustafa Pasha]])</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Other sources claim that he spent his slavery in [[Ottoman Navy]] on [[galley]]s as an [[oarsman]], where he picked up a knowledge of [[Turkic languages]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bohdan Khmelnitsky&quot;/&gt;While there is no concrete evidence as to his return to Ukraine, most historians believe Khmelnytsky either escaped or was ransomed</span>
				<span class='text'>Sources vary as to his benefactor &amp;mdash; his mother, friends, the Polish king &amp;mdash; but perhaps by [[Krzysztof Zbaraski]], ambassador of the Commonwealth to the [[Ottomans]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1622 he paid 30,000 [[thaler]]s in ransom for all [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] captured at the Battle of Cecora</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon return to Subotiv, Khmelnytsky took over operating his father's estate and became a [[Registered Cossacks|registered Cossack]] in the [[Chyhyryn Regiment]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was later promoted to [[pysar]] (a historical officer title among Cossacks)</span>
				<span class='text'>Since 1625 he participated in several sea raids on [[Constantinople]] together with [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In those raids he earned his title of [[sotnyk]] (a leader of a hundred)</span>
				<span class='text'>During this period his widowed mother remarried, to [[Belarusians|Belarusian]] noble Vasyl Stavetsky, and moved to his estate, leaving Khmelnytsky in charge of Subotiv</span>
				<span class='text'>Within year she gave birth to another son, Hryhoriy; later he took his mother's name, becoming known as Hryhoriy Khmelnytsky</span>
				<span class='text'>For a short time the senior Khmelnytsky served as a [[koniuszy]] to hetman [[Miko≈Çaj Potocki]], but departed relatively quickly after a personal conflict</span>
				<span class='text'>==Marriage and family===Bohdan Khmelnytsky married Hanna Somkivna, a daughter of a rich [[Principality of Pereslavl|Pereyaslavl]] Cossack; the couple settled in [[Subotiv]]</span>
				<span class='text'>By the second half of the 1620s, they had three daughters: Stepanida, Olena, and Kateryna</span>
				<span class='text'>His first son [[Tymofiy Khmelnytsky|Tymish (Tymofiy)]] was born in 1632, and another son [[Yuriy Khmelnytsky|Yuriy]] was born in 1640</span>
				<span class='text'>uring this time Khmelnytsky ran his estate and advanced in rank in his regiment</span>
				<span class='text'>He first became a [[sotnyk]] and later advanced to the rank of a regiment scribe</span>
				<span class='text'>He had significant negotiation skills and commanded respect of his fellow Cossacks</span>
				<span class='text'>On 30 August 1637 he was included in a delegation to [[Warsaw]] to plead the Cossacks' case before the Polish King [[W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Serving in the army of a Polish magnate and respected commander, hetman Stanis≈Çaw Koniecpolski, he participated in a successful campaign when the Commonwealth army (and his regiment) scored a decisive victory over the [[Crimean Khanate]] in 1644</span>
				<span class='text'>According to archival documents, he also had a meeting in Warsaw with the French ambassador Count De Bregie, during which he discussed the possibility of Cossack participation in war in France</span>
				<span class='text'>Sources vary as to whether in April 1645 he traveled to France (to [[Fontainebleau]]) to discuss further details of Cossack service in France; this claim is supported by Ukrainian historiography but disputed by Polish scholarship</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In October 1644 around 2,000 (two thousand) Polish infantry soldiers (some scholars think they were Cossacks, but the French sources do not identify them as such) went to France by sea via [[Gda≈Ñsk]] and [[Calais]], where they participated in the siege and capture of [[Dunkerque]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;!-- On whose behalf? --&gt;===Czapli≈Ñski Affair===Upon the death of magnate [[Stanis≈Çaw Koniecpolski]], an advocate of fair treatment of [[Cossacks]], his successor [[Aleksander Koniecpolski (1620-1659)|Aleksander]] redrew the maps of his possessions</span>
				<span class='text'>He laid claim to Khmelnytsky's estate, claiming it as his</span>
				<span class='text'>Trying to find protection from this grab by the powerful magnate, Khmelnytsky wrote numerous appeals and letters to different representatives of the Polish crown &amp;mdash; but to no avail</span>
				<span class='text'>At the end of 1645 the Chyhyryn [[starosta]] [[Daniel Czapli≈Ñski]] officially received authority from Koniecpolski to seize Khmelnytsky's Subotiv estate</span>
				<span class='text'>In the summer of 1646, Khmelnytsky arranged an audience with King W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV to plead his case, as he had favorable standing at the court</span>
				<span class='text'>W≈Çadys≈Çaw, who wanted Cossacks on his side in the wars he planned, gave Khmelnytsky a royal charter, protecting his rights to the Subotiv estate</span>
				<span class='text'>But, because of the structure of the Commonwealth at that time and the lawlessness of Ukraine, even the King was not able to prevent a confrontation with local magnates</span>
				<span class='text'>In the beginning of 1647, Daniel Czapli≈Ñski started to harass Khmelnytsky in order to force him off the land</span>
				<span class='text'>On two occasions the magnate had Subotiv raided: considerable property damage was done and Khmelnytsky's son Yuriy was badly beaten</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally, in April 1647, Czapli≈Ñski succeeded in evicting Khmelnytsky from the land, and he was forced to move with his large family to a relative's house in Chyhyryn</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=Biedronska/&gt;]]In May 1647 Khmelnytsky arranged a second audience with the King to plead his case, but found him unwilling to confront a powerful magnate</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition to losing the estate, Khmelnytsky suffered the loss of his wife Hanna, and he was left alone with their children</span>
				<span class='text'>He promptly remarried, to Motrona ({{ill-WD|Olena Chaplynska|Q2077819}})</span>
				<span class='text'>He not less successful in real estate, unable to regain either the land and property of his estate, or financial compensation for it</span>
				<span class='text'>During this time, he met several higher Polish officials to discuss the Cossacks' war with the Tatars, and used this occasion again to plead his case with Czapli≈Ñski, still unsuccessfully</span>
				<span class='text'>hile Khmelnytsky found no support from the Polish officials, he found it in his Cossack friends and subordinates</span>
				<span class='text'>His Chyhyryn regiment and others were on his side</span>
				<span class='text'>All through the autumn of 1647 Khmelnytsky traveled from one regiment to another, and had numerous consultations with Cossack leaders throughout Ukraine</span>
				<span class='text'>His activity raised suspicion among the local Polish authorities already used to Cossack revolts; he was promptly arrested</span>
				<span class='text'>Koniecpolski issued an order for his execution, but the Chyhyryn Cossack [[polkovnyk]], who held Khmelnytsky, was persuaded to release him</span>
				<span class='text'>Not willing to tempt fate any further, Khmelnytsky headed for the [[Zaporozhian Sich]] with a group of his supporters</span>

				<span class='text'>]{{Main|Khmelnytsky Uprising}}While the Czapli≈Ñski Affair is generally regarded as the immediate cause of the Uprising, it was only a catalyst for bringing a talented Cossack to lead actions representing popular discontent among the people of what is now Ukraine</span>
				<span class='text'>{cn|date=August 2015}} Religion, ethnicity, and economics factored into this discontent</span>
				<span class='text'>While the [[Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth]] remained [[Union of Lublin|a union]] of two nations: of [[Poland]] and [[Lithuania]], a sizable population of Orthodox [[Ruthenians]] were ignored</span>
				<span class='text'>Oppressed by the Polish magnates, they took their wrath out on Poles, as well as Jewish traders, who often managed Polish nobles' estates</span>
				<span class='text'>The advent of the [[Counter-Reformation]] worsened relations between the Orthodox and Catholic Churches</span>
				<span class='text'>Many Orthodox Ukrainians considered the [[Union of Brest]] as a threat to their Orthodox faith</span>

				<span class='text'>On 7 December 1648 his small (300‚Äì500-man) detachment, with the help of registered Cossacks who went over to his side, disarmed the small Polish detachment guarding the area and took over the Zaporozhian Sich</span>
				<span class='text'>{cn|date=August 2015}} The Poles' attempt to retake the Sich was decisively fought off as more registered Cossacks joined his forces</span>
				<span class='text'>At the end of January 1649, a [[Cossack Rada]] was called and Khmelnytsky was unanimously elected a [[hetman]]</span>
				<span class='text'>A period of feverish activity followed</span>
				<span class='text'>Cossacks were sent with hetman's letters to many regions of Ukraine calling on Cossacks and Orthodox peasants to join the rebellion, [[Khortytsia]] was fortified, efforts were made to acquire and make weapons and ammunition, and emissaries were sent to the [[Khan of Crimea]], [[ƒ∞sl√¢m III Giray]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{History of Ukraine}}Initially, Polish authorities took the news of Khmelnytsky's arrival at the Sich and reports about the rebellion lightly</span>
				<span class='text'>The two sides exchanged lists of demands: the Poles asked for Cossacks to surrender the mutinous leader and disband, while Khmelnytsky and the Rada demanded that the Commonwealth restore the Cossacks' ancient rights, stop the advance of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]], yield the right to appoint Orthodox leaders of the Sich and of the Registered Cossack regiments, and remove the Commonwealth troops from Ukraine</span>

				<span class='text'>Had the Cossacks stayed at [[Khortytsia]], they might have been defeated as in many other rebellions</span>

				<span class='text'>This was repeated soon after, with the same success, at the [[Battle of Korsu≈Ñ]] on 26 May 1648</span>
				<span class='text'>Khmelnytsky used his diplomatic and military skills: under his leadership, the Cossack army moved to battle positions following his plans, Cossacks were proactive and decisive in their maneuvers and attacks, and most importantly, he gained the support of both large contingents of registered Cossacks and the [[Giray dynasty|Crimean Khan]] &amp;mdash; his crucial ally for the many battles to come</span>

				<span class='text'>His leadership was demonstrated in all areas of state-building: in the military, administration, finance, economics, and culture</span>
				<span class='text'>Khmelnytsky made the [[Zaporozhian Host]] under the leadership of its hetman the supreme power in the new Ukrainian state, and unified all the spheres of Ukrainian society under his authority</span>
				<span class='text'>Khmelnytsky built a new government system and developed military and civilian administration</span>
				<span class='text'>uring this time a new generation of statesmen and military leaders came to the forefront: [[Ivan Vyhovsky]], [[Pavlo Teteria]], [[Danylo Nechai]] and [[Ivan Nechai]], [[Ivan Bohun]], [[Hryhoriy Hulyanytsky]]</span>
				<span class='text'>From Cossack polkovnyks, officers, and military commanders, a new elite within the Cossack Hetman state was born</span>

				<span class='text'>But it was also instrumental in the onset of the period of [[Ruin (period of history)|Ruin]] that followed, eventually destroying most of the achievements of the Khmelnytsky era</span>

				<span class='text'>]====Complications====Khmelnytsky's initial successes were followed by a series of setbacks as neither Khmelnytsky nor the Commonwealth had had enough strength to stabilize the situation or to inflict a defeat on the enemy</span>
				<span class='text'>What followed was a period of intermittent warfare and several peace treaties, which were seldom upheld</span>
				<span class='text'>From the spring of 1649 on, the situation turned for the worse for the Cossacks, as Polish attacks increased in frequency, they became more successful</span>
				<span class='text'>The resulting [[Treaty of Zboriv]] on 18 August 1649 was unfavourable for the Cossacks</span>
				<span class='text'>This was followed by another defeat at the [[battle of Berestechko]] on 18 June 1651, where the Tatars betrayed Khmelnytsky and held the hetman captive</span>
				<span class='text'>The Cossacks suffered a crushing defeat, with an estimated 30,000 casualties</span>
				<span class='text'>They were forced to sign the [[Treaty of Bila Tserkva]], which favoured the Polish‚ÄìLithuanians</span>
				<span class='text'>Warfare broke open again and, in the years that followed, the two sides were almost perpetually at war</span>
				<span class='text'>In this situation the [[Crimean Tatars]] played a decisive role ‚Äî and did not allow either side to prevail</span>
				<span class='text'>It was in their interests to keep both Ukraine and the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth from getting too strong and becoming an effective power in the region</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Khmelnytsky started looking for another foreign ally</span>
				<span class='text'> Although the Cossacks had established their ''[[de facto]]'' independence from Poland, the new state needed legitimacy in 17th century Europe, which could be provided by a foreign monarch</span>
				<span class='text'>In search of a protectorate, Khmelnytsky approached the [[Ottoman sultan]] in 1651 and formal embassies were exchanged</span>
				<span class='text'>The Turks offered vassalship similar to their other arrangements with contemporary [[Khanate of Crimea|Crimea]], [[Moldavia]] and [[Walachia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the idea of a union with the [[Muslim]] monarch was not acceptable to the general populace and most Cossacks</span>
				<span class='text'>The other possible ally was Orthodox [[Tsardom of Russia|Russia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>That government remained quite cautious and stayed away from the hostilities in Ukraine</span>
				<span class='text'>In spite of numerous envoys and calls for help from Khmelnytsky in the name of the shared Orthodox faith, the Tsar preferred to wait until the threat of a Cossack-Ottoman union in 1653 finally forced him to action</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;Subtelny&quot; /&gt; The idea that the Tsar might be favourable to taking Ukraine under his hand was communicated to the hetman, and the diplomatic activity intensified</span>
				<span class='text'>==Treaty with the [[Tsardom of Russia]]==={{Main|Treaty of Pereyaslav}}After a series of negotiations, it was agreed that the Cossacks would accept overlordship by the Tsar [[Alexei Mikhailovich]]</span>
				<span class='text'>To finalize the treaty, a Russian embassy led by [[boyar]] [[Vasily Buturlin]] came to [[Pereyaslav]], where on 18 January 1654 the Cossack Rada was called and the treaty concluded</span>
				<span class='text'>Historians have not come to consensus in interpreting the intentions of the [[Tsardom of Russia]] and Khmelnytsky in signing this agreement</span>
				<span class='text'>The treaty legitimized Russian claims to the capital of [[Kievan Rus']] and strengthened the Tsar's  influence in the region</span>
				<span class='text'>Khmelnytsky needed the Treaty of Pereyaslav to gain a legitimate monarch's protection, as well as support from a friendly Orthodox power</span>
				<span class='text'>Historians have differed in their reading of Khmelnytsky's goal with the union, as to whether it was to be a military union, a [[suzerainty]], or a complete incorporation of Ukraine into the [[Tsardom of Russia]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Khmelnytsky stormed out of the church and threatened to cancel the entire treaty</span>

				<span class='text'>[[Tsardom of Russia|Russia]] entered the scene, and the Cossacks' former allies, the Tatars, went over  to the Polish side</span>
				<span class='text'>They initiated warfare against Khmelnytsky</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Tatar invasions|Tatar raids]] depopulated whole areas of Ukraine</span>
				<span class='text'>Cossacks, aided by the Tsar's army, took revenge on Polish possessions in [[Belarus]], and in the spring of 1654, the Cossacks drove the Poles from much of the country</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Sweden]] entered the melee</span>
				<span class='text'>Old adversaries of both Poland and Russia, they occupied a share of Lithuania before the Russians could get there</span>
				<span class='text'>The occupation displeased Russia because the Tsar thought to take over the Swedish Baltic provinces</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1656, with the Commonwealth increasingly war-torn but also increasingly hostile and successful against the Swedes, the ruler of [[Transylvania]], [[George II R√°k√≥czi]], also joined in</span>
				<span class='text'>Charles X of Sweden had solicited his help because of the massive Polish popular opposition and resistance against the Swedes</span>
				<span class='text'>Under blows from all sides, the Commonwealth barely survived</span>
				<span class='text'>ussia attacked Sweden in July 1656, at a time when its forces were deeply involved in Poland</span>
				<span class='text'>That war ended in status quo two years later, but it complicated matters for Khmelnytsky, as his ally was now fighting his overlord</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition to diplomatic tensions between the Tsar and Khmelnytsky, a number of other disagreements between the two surfaced</span>
				<span class='text'>In particular, these concered Russian officials' interference in the finances of the [[Cossack Hetmanate|Hetmanate]] and in the newly captured Belarus</span>
				<span class='text'>The Tsar concluded a separate treaty with the Poles in [[Vilnius]] in 1656</span>
				<span class='text'>The Hetman's emissaries were not even allowed to attend the negotiations</span>
				<span class='text'>Khmelnytsky wrote an irate letter to the Tsar accusing him of breaking the Pereyaslav agreement</span>
				<span class='text'>He compared the Swedes to the Tsar, saying that the former were more honourable and trustworthy than the Russians</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;Subtelny&quot; /&gt;In Poland, the Cossack army and Transylvanian allies suffered a number of setbacks</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, Khmelnytsky had to deal with a Cossack rebellion on the home front</span>
				<span class='text'>Troubling news also came from Crimea, as Tatars in alliance with Poland were preparing for a new [[invasion]] of Ukraine</span>
