				<span class='text'>In the summer of 1646 Khmelnytsky arranged an audience with King W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV to plead his case as he had favorable standing at the court</span>
				<span class='text'>W≈Çadys≈Çaw who wanted Cossacks on his side in the wars he planned gave Khmelnytsky a royal charter protecting his rights to the Subotiv estate</span>
				<span class='text'>But because of the structure of the Commonwealth at that time and the lawlessness of Ukraine even the King was not able to prevent a confrontation with local magnates</span>
				<span class='text'>In the beginning of 1647 Daniel Czapli≈Ñski started to harass Khmelnytsky in order to force him off the land</span>
				<span class='text'>On two occasions the magnate had Subotiv raided considerable property damage was done and Khmelnytskys son Yuriy was badly beaten</span>
