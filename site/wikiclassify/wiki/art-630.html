				<span class='text'>In January 1940, Smith was sent to Berlin, where he joined the [[Columbia Broadcasting System]] under [[Edward R</span>
				<span class='text'>Murrow]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He visited [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s mountain retreat at [[Berchtesgaden]] and interviewed many leading [[Nazism|Nazis]], including Hitler himself, [[Schutzstaffel]] or &quot;SS&quot; leader [[Heinrich Himmler]] and Propaganda Minister [[Joseph Goebbels]]</span>
				<span class='text'>When Smith refused to include Nazi [[propaganda]] in his reports, the [[Gestapo]] seized his notebooks and threw him out of the country</span>
				<span class='text'>He left for Switzerland on December 6, 1941, the day before the Japanese attack on [[Pearl Harbor]], Hawaii</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;He was one of the last American reporters to leave Berlin before Germany and the United States went to war</span>
				<span class='text'>His 1942 book, ''Last Train from Berlin: An Eye-Witness Account of Germany at War'' describes the reporter's observations from Berlin in the year after the departure of ''[[Berlin Diary]]'' author [[William L</span>
				<span class='text'>Shirer]]</span>
				<span class='text'>''Last Train from Berlin'' became an American best-seller and was reprinted in 2001, shortly before Smith's death</span>
				<span class='text'>nable to leave Switzerland, where he and his young wife spent most of the war, Smith reported whatever the Swiss government would permit</span>
				<span class='text'>After the liberation of France, he began reporting on Germany and central Europe from [[Berne, Switzerland|Berne]]</span>
				<span class='text'>By the winter of 1944&amp;ndash;1945, he began sending vivid [[radio]] accounts of the German counter-attack in the [[Ardennes]] known as the [[Battle of the Bulge]], and he accompanied Allied forces across the [[Rhine River]] and into Berlin</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;Smith became a significant member of the &quot;Murrow Boys&quot; that made CBS the dominant broadcast news organization of the era</span>
				<span class='text'>In May 1945, he returned to Berlin to recount the German surrender</span>
				<span class='text'>==Post-war===In 1946, Smith went to London for CBS with the title of chief European correspondent</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1947, he made a long broadcasting tour of most of the nations of Europe, including behind the [[Iron Curtain]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1949, Knopf published his ''The State of Europe'', a 408-page country-by-country survey of Europe that drew on these experiences and that argued &quot;both the American and the Russian policies are mistaken&quot;; he advocated more &quot;social reform&quot; for Western Europe and more &quot;political liberty&quot; for Eastern Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1959, Smith hosted a 21-week public affairs series entitled ''Behind the News with Howard K</span>
				<span class='text'>Smith''</span>
				<span class='text'>Broadcasts included a two-part program on [[Nikita Khrushchev]], the [[St</span>
				<span class='text'>Lawrence Seaway]], [[Fidel Castro]] in [[Cuba]], and [[unemployment]] problems in distressed areas</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1960, having established residence earlier in [[Bethesda, Maryland]], Smith chaired the first-ever televised presidential debates, held between U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Senator [[John F</span>
				<span class='text'>Kennedy]] of [[Massachusetts]] and [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Richard Nixon|Richard M</span>
				<span class='text'>Nixon]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n late 1961, Smith left his job at CBS when a dispute erupted over a [[Documentary film|documentary]] called ''Who Speaks for Birmingham?''</span>
				<span class='text'>This in-depth investigation concerned the battle between [[civil and political rights|civil rights]] forces and the police of [[Birmingham, Alabama]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Smith, an advocate of [[desegregation]], concluded his commentary at the end of the program by recalling the admonition commonly attributed to [[Edmund Burke]]&amp;mdash;&quot;All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Smith was told to remove the Burke quote from the end of the broadcast</span>
				<span class='text'>Network president and founder [[William S</span>
				<span class='text'>Paley]] declined to support Smith over the matter, and Smith promptly left the network after twenty years of service</span>
				<span class='text'>Smith declared that his hatred of discrimination stemmed from living in the racially segregated [[American South]] and from watching the Nazis in Europe during the world war</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;==ABC, 1962 – 1979==Smith moved to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] at a time when that network's news division was a distant third among the &quot;Big Three&quot; networks</span>
				<span class='text'>After the 1962 mid-term elections, Smith presented a documentary entitled, &quot;The Political Obituary of Richard Nixon&quot; as part of his ''[[Howard K</span>
				<span class='text'>Smith: News and Comment]]'' (1962–1963) [[television program|television series]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Smith referred to Nixon's &quot;[[Richard Nixon's last press conference|last press conference]]&quot; after his disastrous losing campaign against [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Pat Brown|Edmund G</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Pat&quot; Brown, Sr</span>
				<span class='text'>], for [[governor of California]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In that exchange, the former vice president famously told reporters that they would not &quot;have Nixon to kick around any more</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Smith included in the broadcast an interview with Nixon's longstanding nemesis [[Alger Hiss]], a convicted [[Cold War]] [[perjury|perjurer]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; ''Howard K</span>
				<span class='text'>Smith: News and Comment'' aired in the 10:30 Eastern slot on Sundays, opposite [[CBS]]'s long-running quiz program ''[[What's My Line?]]'' hosted by [[John Charles Daly]], who had been the first ever ABC news anchorman</span>
				<span class='text'>ABC stood by Smith on the Nixon &quot;obituary&quot;, but sponsors dried up for the program thereafter</span>
				<span class='text'>It was revived in the 1963&amp;ndash;1964 season as simply ''ABC News Reports''</span>

				<span class='text'>n June 5, 1968, Smith was anchoring coverage of the [[California]] [[presidential primary]] that had stretched to 3 a</span>

				<span class='text'>New York time</span>
				<span class='text'>As the closing credits for the special were airing, word came in that [[United States Senate|U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Senator]] [[Robert F</span>
				<span class='text'>Kennedy]] of New York had just been shot</span>
				<span class='text'>ABC simply showed a wide shot of the chaotic [[newsroom]] for several minutes until Smith was able to confirm the initial story and go back on the air with a [[special report]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He continued at the anchor desk for several more hours for reports of Kennedy's condition</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1969, the veteran reporter became the co-anchor of the ''ABC Evening News,'' first with [[Frank Reynolds]], then the following year with another CBS alumnus, [[Harry Reasoner]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He began making increasingly [[Conservative (politics)|conservative]] commentaries, in particular adopting a hard-line stance in support of the [[Vietnam War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He contrasted President [[Lyndon B</span>

				<span class='text'>hp?id=1&lt;/ref&gt; These commentaries endeared him to President Nixon, who rewarded him with a rare, hour-long, one-on-one interview in 1971, at the height of the administration's animus against major newspapers, CBS, and NBC,  despite Smith's having broadcast his &quot;political obituary&quot; only nine years earlier</span>

				<span class='text'>Muskie]] of [[Maine]], indicating Smith's full support for Muskie</span>

				<span class='text'>Continuing as an analyst until 1979, Smith left the network as the [[Roone Arledge]] era was beginning at ABC News and full retirement age approached</span>
				<span class='text'>Sources say that Smith was embittered over the reduction in time allowed for his commentaries and hence resigned after he criticized the revamped ''World News Tonight'' format as a &quot;[[Punch and Judy]] show</span>
