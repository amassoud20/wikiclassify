				<span class='text'>In 1910 he left [[Vienna]] to see the world, traveling throughout Europe and Africa and later Asia and the [[Pacific]] area</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1913, he studied painting in Paris, France</span>
				<span class='text'>t the outbreak of [[World War I]], Lang returned to [[Vienna]] and volunteered for military service in the [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian]] army and fought in Russia and [[Romania]], where he was wounded three times</span>
				<span class='text'>While recovering from his injuries and [[combat stress reaction|shell shock]] in 1916, he wrote some scenarios and ideas for films</span>
				<span class='text'>He was discharged from the army with the rank of lieutenant in 1918 and did some acting in the Viennese theater circuit for a short time before being hired as a writer at Decla, [[Erich Pommer]]'s Berlin-based production company</span>
				<span class='text'>==Expressionist films: the Weimar years (1918–1933)===Lang's writing stint was brief, as he soon started to work as a director at the German film studio [[Universum Film AG|Ufa]], and later [[Nero-Film]], just as the [[German Expressionism|Expressionist]] movement was building</span>
				<span class='text'>In this first phase of his career, Lang alternated between films such as ''[[Der Müde Tod]]'' (&quot;The Weary Death&quot;) and popular thrillers such as ''[[Die Spinnen]]'' (&quot;The Spiders&quot;), combining popular genres with Expressionist techniques to create an unprecedented synthesis of popular entertainment with [[art film|art cinema]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1920, he met his future wife, the writer and actress [[Thea von Harbou]]</span>
				<span class='text'>She and Lang co-wrote all of his movies from 1921 through 1933, including ''[[Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Mabuse, der Spieler]]'' (Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Mabuse the Gambler; 1922), which ran for over four hours in two parts in the original version and was the first in the [[Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Mabuse]] trilogy, the five-hour ''[[Die Nibelungen: Siegfried|Die Nibelungen]]'' (1924), the famous 1927 film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'', the science fiction film ''[[Woman in the Moon]]'' (1929), and the 1931 classic, ''[[M (1931 film)|M]]'', his first &quot;[[talkie|talking]]&quot; picture</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Fritz Lang und Thea von Harbou, 1923 od</span>
				<span class='text'>1924</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Fritz Lang and Thea von Harbou in their Berlin flat, 1923 or 1924]]Considered by many film scholars to be his masterpiece, ''M'' is a disturbing story of a child murderer ([[Peter Lorre]] in his first starring role) who is hunted down and brought to rough justice by Berlin's criminal underworld</span>
				<span class='text'>''M'' remains a powerful work; it was [[M (1951 film)|remade]] in 1951 by [[Joseph Losey]], but this version had little impact on audiences, and has become harder to see than the original film</span>
				<span class='text'>uring the climactic final scene in ''M'', Lang allegedly threw Peter Lorre down a flight of stairs in order to give more authenticity to Lorre's battered look</span>
				<span class='text'>Lang, who was known for being hard to work with, epitomized the stereotype of the tyrannical German film director, a type embodied also by [[Erich von Stroheim]] and [[Otto Preminger]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His wearing a [[monocle]] added to the stereotype</span>
				<span class='text'>n the films of his German period, Lang produced a coherent [[oeuvre]] that established the characteristics later attributed to ''[[film noir]]'', with its recurring themes of psychological conflict, paranoia, fate and moral ambiguity</span>
				<span class='text'>t the end of 1932, Lang started filming ''[[The Testament of Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Mabuse]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in January 1933, and by March 30, the new regime banned it as an incitement to public disorder</span>
				<span class='text'>''Testament'' is sometimes deemed an anti-Nazi film as Lang had put phrases used by the Nazis into the mouth of the title character</span>
				<span class='text'>ang was worried about the advent of the Nazi regime, partly because of his Jewish heritage,&lt;ref name=&quot;religion&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>They soon divorced</span>
				<span class='text'>Lang's fears would be realized following his departure from Austria, as under the [[Nuremberg Laws]] he would be identified as a Jew even though his mother was a converted Roman Catholic, and he was raised as such</span>
				<span class='text'>==Emigration===Shortly afterwards, Lang left Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Lang, propaganda minister [[Joseph Goebbels]] called Lang to his offices to inform him that ''[[The Testament of Dr Mabuse]]'' was being banned but that he was nevertheless so impressed by Lang's abilities as a filmmaker (especially ''Metropolis''), he was offering Lang a position as the head of German film studio [[Universum Film AG|UFA]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Lang had stated that it was during this meeting that he had decided to leave for Paris – but that the banks had closed by the time the meeting was over</span>
				<span class='text'>Lang has stated that he fled that very evening</span>

				<span class='text'>He then went to the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;KalatDVD&quot;/&gt;===Hollywood career (1936–1957)===In Hollywood, Lang signed first with [[MGM]] Studios</span>
				<span class='text'> His first American film was the crime drama ''[[Fury (1936 film)|Fury]]'', which starred [[Spencer Tracy]] as a man who is wrongly accused of a crime and nearly killed when a lynch mob sets fire to the jail where he is awaiting trial</span>
				<span class='text'> Lang became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States in 1939</span>
				<span class='text'>He made twenty-three features in his 20-year American career, working in a variety of genres at every major studio in Hollywood, and occasionally producing his films as an independent</span>
				<span class='text'>Lang's American films were often compared unfavorably to his earlier works by contemporary critics, but the restrained Expressionism of these films is now seen as integral to the emergence and evolution of American genre cinema, ''[[film noir]]'' in particular</span>
				<span class='text'>ne of his most famous ''films noir'' is the police drama ''[[The Big Heat]]'' (1953), noted for its uncompromising brutality, especially for a scene in which [[Lee Marvin]] throws scalding coffee on [[Gloria Grahame]]'s face</span>
				<span class='text'>As Lang's visual style simplified, in part due to the constraints of the Hollywood studio system, his worldview became increasingly pessimistic, culminating in the cold, geometric style of his last American films, ''[[While the City Sleeps (1956 film)|While the City Sleeps]]'' (1956) and ''[[Beyond a Reasonable Doubt (1956 film)|Beyond a Reasonable Doubt]]'' (1956)</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Fritz Lang (1969)</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Fritz Lang (1969)]]Finding it difficult to find congenial production conditions and backers in Hollywood, particularly as his health declined with age, Lang contemplated retirement</span>
				<span class='text'>The German producer [[Artur Brauner]] had expressed interest in remaking ''[[The Indian Tomb (1921 film)|The Indian Tomb]]'' (a story that Lang had developed in the 1920s which had ultimately been directed by [[Joe May]]),</span>

				<span class='text'>Following the production, Brauner was  preparing for a remake of ''[[The Testament of Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Mabuse]]'' when Lang approached him with the idea of adding a new original film to the series</span>
				<span class='text'>The result was ''[[The Thousand Eyes of Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Mabuse]]'' (1960), whose success led to a series of new Mabuse films, which were produced by Brauner (including the remake of ''The Testament of Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Mabuse''), though Lang did not direct any of the sequels</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[The Thousand Eyes of Dr</span>
