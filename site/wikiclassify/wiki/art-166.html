				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot; /&gt; He was one of the few physicists to excel both [[theoretical physicist|theoretically]] and [[experimental physicist|experimentally]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Fermi held several patents related to the use of nuclear power, and was awarded the 1938 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for his work on [[induced radioactivity]] by neutron bombardment and the discovery of [[Transuranium element|transuranic elements]]</span>
				<span class='text'> He made significant contributions to the development of [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]], [[nuclear physics|nuclear]] and [[particle physics]], and [[statistical mechanics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ermi's first major contribution was to statistical mechanics</span>
				<span class='text'>After [[Wolfgang Pauli]] announced his [[Pauli exclusion principle|exclusion principle]] in 1925, Fermi followed with a paper in which he applied the principle to an [[ideal gas]], employing a statistical formulation now known as [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Today, particles that obey the exclusion principle are called &quot;[[fermion]]s&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Later Pauli postulated the existence of an uncharged invisible particle emitted along with an electron during [[beta decay]], to satisfy the law of [[conservation of energy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Fermi took up this idea, developing a model that incorporated the postulated particle, which he named the &quot;[[neutrino]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>His theory, later referred to as [[Fermi's interaction]] and still later as [[weak interaction]], described one of the [[fundamental interaction|four fundamental forces of nature]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Through experiments inducing radioactivity with recently discovered [[neutron]]s, Fermi discovered that [[slow neutron]]s were more easily [[neutron capture|captured]] than fast ones, and developed the [[Fermi age equation]] to describe this</span>
				<span class='text'>After bombarding [[thorium]] and [[uranium]] with slow neutrons, he concluded that he had created new elements; although he was awarded the Nobel Prize for this discovery, the new elements were subsequently revealed to be [[Nuclear fission product|fission products]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ermi left Italy in 1938 to escape new [[Italian Racial Laws]] that affected his Jewish wife Laura</span>
				<span class='text'>He emigrated to the United States where he worked on the [[Manhattan Project]] during World War II</span>
				<span class='text'>Fermi led the team that designed and built [[Chicago Pile-1]], which went [[Nuclear reactor physics#Criticality|critical]] on 2 December 1942, demonstrating the first artificial self-sustaining [[nuclear chain reaction]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was on hand when the [[X-10 Graphite Reactor]] at [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], went critical in 1943, and when the [[B Reactor]] at the [[Hanford Site]] did so the next year</span>
				<span class='text'>At [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] he headed F Division, part of which worked on [[Edward Teller]]'s [[Thermonuclear fusion|thermonuclear]] &quot;[[History of the Teller–Ulam design|Super]]&quot; bomb</span>
				<span class='text'>He was present at the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity test]] on 16 July 1945, where he used his [[Fermi problem|Fermi method]] to estimate the bomb's yield</span>
				<span class='text'>fter the war, Fermi served under [[J</span>
				<span class='text'>Robert Oppenheimer]] on the General Advisory Committee, which advised the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] on nuclear matters and policy</span>
				<span class='text'>Following the detonation of the first Soviet [[Nuclear weapon#Fission weapons|fission bomb]] in August 1949, he strongly opposed the development of a hydrogen bomb on both moral and technical grounds</span>
				<span class='text'>He was among the scientists who testified on Oppenheimer's behalf at the 1954 [[Oppenheimer security hearing|hearing]] that resulted in the denial of the latter's security clearance</span>
				<span class='text'>Fermi did important work in particle physics, especially related to [[pion]]s and [[muon]]s, and he speculated that [[cosmic ray]]s arose through material being accelerated by magnetic fields in interstellar space</span>
				<span class='text'>Many awards, concepts, and institutions are [[list of things named after Enrico Fermi|named after Fermi]], including the [[Enrico Fermi Award]], the [[Enrico Fermi Institute]], the [[Fermilab|Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory]], the [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope]], the [[Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station]], and the synthetic element [[fermium]] (one of just over a dozen [[List of scientists whose names are used in chemical element names|elements named after people]])</span>
				<span class='text'>= Early life ==Enrico Fermi was born in Rome on 29 September 1901</span>
				<span class='text'>He was the third child of Alberto Fermi, a division head (''{{lang|it|Capo Divisione}}'') in the Ministry of Railways, and Ida de Gattis, an elementary school teacher</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Segrè|1970|pp=3–4, 8}}{{sfn|Amaldi|2001|p=23}} His only sister, Maria, was two years older than him, and his brother Giulio was a year older</span>
				<span class='text'>After the two boys were sent to a rural community to be [[wet nurse]]d, Enrico rejoined his family in Rome when he was two and a half</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Cooper|1999|p=19}}  Although he was baptised a [[Roman Catholic]] in accordance with his grandparents' wishes, his family, like most Italian families, was not particularly religious; Enrico was an [[Agnosticism|agnostic]] throughout his adult life</span>
				<span class='text'>As a young boy he shared the same interests as his brother Giulio, building [[electric motor]]s and playing with electrical and mechanical toys</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Segrè|1970|pp=5–6}} Giulio died during the administration of an anesthetic for an operation on a throat [[abscess]] in 1915</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Fermi|1954|pp=15–16}}One of Fermi's first sources for his study of physics was a book he found at the local market at ''[[Campo de' Fiori]]'' in Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>Published in 1840, the 900-page''Elementorum physicae mathematicae'', was written in Latin by [[Jesuit]] Father [[Andrea Caraffa]], a professor at the [[Collegio Romano]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It covered [[mathematics]], [[classical mechanics]], [[astronomy]], [[optics]], and [[acoustics]], insofar as these disciplines were understood when the book was written</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Segrè|1970|p=7}}{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|p=315}} Fermi befriended another scientifically inclined student, [[Enrico Persico]],{{sfn|Amaldi|2001|p=24}} and together the two worked on scientific projects such as building [[gyroscope]]s and trying to accurately measure the acceleration of Earth's [[gravity]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Segrè|1970|pp=11-12}} Fermi's interest in physics was further encouraged by his father's colleague Adolfo Amidei, who gave him several books on physics and mathematics, which he read and assimilated quickly</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Segrè|1970|pp=8–10}}== ''Scuola Normale Superiore'' in Pisa ==[[File:Enrico Fermi giovane</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|right|thumb|upright|Enrico Fermi as a student in Pisa]]Fermi graduated from high school in July 1918 and, at Amidei's urging, applied to the ''[[Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa|Scuola Normale Superiore]]'' in [[Pisa]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Having lost one son, his parents were reluctant to let him move away from home for four years while attending the [[Sapienza University of Rome]], but in the end they acquiesced</span>
				<span class='text'>The school provided free lodging for students, but candidates had to take a difficult entrance exam that included an essay</span>
				<span class='text'>The given theme was &quot;Specific characteristics of Sounds&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The 17-year-old Fermi chose to derive and solve the [[partial differential equation]] for a vibrating rod, applying [[Fourier analysis]] in the solution</span>
				<span class='text'>The examiner, Professor Giuseppe Pittarelli from the Sapienza University of Rome, interviewed Fermi and praised that he would become an outstanding physicist in the future</span>
				<span class='text'>Fermi achieved first place in the classification of the entrance exam</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Segrè|1970|pp=11–13}}During his years at the ''Scuola Normale Superiore'', Fermi teamed up with a fellow student named [[Franco Rasetti]] with whom he would indulge in light-hearted pranks and who would later become Fermi's close friend and collaborator</span>
				<span class='text'>In Pisa, Fermi was advised by the director of the physics laboratory, [[Luigi Puccianti]], who acknowledged that there was little that he could teach Fermi, and frequently asked Fermi to teach him something instead</span>
				<span class='text'>Fermi's knowledge of quantum physics reached such a high level that Puccianti asked him to organize seminars on the topic</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Segrè|1970|pp=15–18}} During this time Fermi learned [[tensor calculus]], a mathematical technique invented by [[Gregorio Ricci]] and [[Tullio Levi-Civita]] that was needed to demonstrate the principles of [[general relativity]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bonolis|2001|p=320}} Fermi initially chose mathematics as his major, but soon switched to physics</span>
				<span class='text'>He remained largely self-taught, studying general relativity, [[quantum mechanics]], and [[atomic physics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bonolis|2001|pp=317–319}}In September 1920, Fermi was admitted to the Physics department</span>
				<span class='text'>Since there were only three students in the department—Fermi, Rasetti, and [[Nello Carrara]]—Puccianti let them freely use the laboratory for whatever purposes they chose</span>
				<span class='text'>Fermi decided that they should research [[X-ray crystallography]], and the three worked to produce a Laue photograph—an X-ray photograph of a crystal</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Segrè|1970|p=20}} During 1921, his third year at the university, Fermi published his first scientific works in the Italian journal ''[[Nuovo Cimento]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The first was entitled &quot;On the dynamics of a rigid system of electrical charges in translational motion&quot; ({{Lang-it|Sulla dinamica di un sistema rigido di cariche elettriche in moto traslatorio}})</span>
				<span class='text'>A sign of things to come was that the [[mass]] was expressed as a [[tensor]]—a mathematical construct commonly used to describe something moving and changing in three-dimensional space</span>
				<span class='text'>In classical mechanics, mass is a [[Scalar (physics)|scalar]] quantity, but in relativity it changes with velocity</span>
				<span class='text'>The second paper was &quot;On the electrostatics of a uniform gravitational field of electromagnetic charges and on the weight of electromagnetic charges&quot; ({{lang-it|Sull'elettrostatica di un campo gravitazionale uniforme e sul peso delle masse elettromagnetiche}})</span>
				<span class='text'>Using general relativity, Fermi showed that a charge has a weight equal to U/c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where U was the electrostatic energy of the system, and c is the [[speed of light]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bonolis|2001|pp=317–319}}The first paper seemed to point out a contradiction between the electrodynamic theory and the relativistic one concerning the calculation of the electromagnetic masses, as the former predicted a value of 4/3 U/c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'>Fermi addressed this the next year in a paper &quot;Concerning a contradiction between [[electrodynamic]] and the relativistic theory of electromagnetic mass&quot; in which he showed that the apparent contradiction was a consequence of relativity</span>
				<span class='text'>This paper was sufficiently well-regarded that it was translated into German and published in the German scientific journal ''[[Physikalische Zeitschrift]]'' in 1922</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Über einen Widerspruch zwischen der elektrodynamischen und relativistischen Theorie der elektromagnetischen Masse |language=German |journal=Physikalische Zeitschrift |volume=23 |pages=340–344 |url=https://en</span>
				<span class='text'>ikisource</span>
				<span class='text'>rg/?curid=1059488 |accessdate=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Fermi submitted his article &quot;On the phenomena occurring near a [[world line]]&quot; ({{lang-it|Sopra i fenomeni che avvengono in vicinanza di una linea oraria}}) to the Italian journal ''[[I Rendiconti dell'Accademia dei Lincei]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>In this article he examined the [[Principle of Equivalence]], and introduced the so-called &quot;[[Fermi coordinates]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He proved that on a world line close to the time line, space behaves as if it were a [[Euclidean space]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Here, it is depicted with one spatial dimension suppressed</span>
				<span class='text'>The time line is the vertical axis</span>
				<span class='text'>]Fermi submitted his thesis, &quot;A theorem on probability and some of its applications&quot; ({{lang-it|Un teorema di calcolo delle probabilità ed alcune sue applicazioni}}), to the ''Scuola Normale Superiore'' in July 1922, and received his [[Laurea#Former status of the Laurea degree|laurea]] at the unusually young age of 21</span>
				<span class='text'>The thesis was on [[X-ray diffraction]] images</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Theoretical physics]] was not yet considered a discipline in Italy, and the only thesis that would have been accepted was one on [[experimental physics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>For this reason, Italian physicists were slow in embracing the new ideas like relativity coming from Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>Since Fermi was quite at home in the lab doing experimental work, this did not pose insurmountable problems for him</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bonolis|2001|p=321}}While writing the appendix for the Italian edition of the book ''Fundamentals of Einstein Relativity'' by [[August Kopff]] in 1923, Fermi was the first to point out that hidden inside the famous [[Mass–energy equivalence|Einstein equation]] ({{nowrap|''E'' {{=}} ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}) was an enormous amount of [[nuclear potential energy]] to be exploited</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;It does not seem possible, at least in the near future&quot;, he wrote, &quot;to find a way to release these dreadful amounts of energy—which is all to the good because the first effect of an explosion of such a dreadful amount of energy would be to smash into smithereens the physicist who had the misfortune to find a way to do it</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|p=321}}In 1924 Fermi was initiated to the [[Freemasonry]] in the [[Masonic Lodge]] &quot;Adriano Lemmi&quot; of the [[Grand Orient of Italy]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Fermi then studied in [[Leiden]] with [[Paul Ehrenfest]] from September to December 1924 on a fellowship from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] obtained through the intercession of the mathematician [[Vito Volterra]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Here Fermi met [[Hendrik Lorentz]] and [[Albert Einstein]], and became good friends with [[Samuel Goudsmit]] and [[Jan Tinbergen]]</span>
				<span class='text'> From January 1925 to late 1926, Fermi taught [[mathematical physics]] and [[theoretical mechanics]] at the [[University of Florence]], where he teamed up with Rasetti to conduct a series of experiments on the effects of magnetic fields on mercury vapour</span>
				<span class='text'>He also participated in seminars at the Sapienza University of Rome, giving lectures on quantum mechanics and [[solid state physics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bonolis|2001|pp=321–324}} While giving lectures of new quantum mechanics based on remarkable accuracy of predictions of Schrödinger equation, the Italian physicist would often say, &quot;It has no business to fit so well!&quot;{{sfn|Hey|Walters|2003|p=61}}After [[Wolfgang Pauli]] announced his [[Pauli exclusion principle|exclusion principle]] in 1925, Fermi responded with a paper &quot;On the quantisation of the perfect monoatomic gas&quot; ({{lang-it|Sulla quantizzazione del gas perfetto monoatomico}}), in which he applied the exclusion principle to an ideal gas</span>
				<span class='text'>The paper was especially notable for Fermi's statistical formulation, which  describes the distribution of particles in [[physical system|systems]] of many [[identical particles]] that obey the exclusion principle</span>
				<span class='text'>This was independently developed soon after by the British physicist [[Paul Dirac]], who also showed how it was related to the [[Bose–Einstein statistics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Accordingly, it is now known as [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bonolis|2001|pp=329–330}} Following Dirac, particles that obey the exclusion principle are today called &quot;[[fermion]]s&quot;, while those that do not are called &quot;[[boson]]s&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Corbino, who also chaired the selection committee, hoped that the new chair would raise the standard and reputation of physics in Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Segrè|1970|p=45}} The committee chose Fermi ahead of Enrico Persico and [[Aldo Pontremoli]],{{sfn|Fermi|1954|p=38}} and Corbino helped Fermi recruit his team, which was soon joined by notable students such as [[Edoardo Amaldi]], [[Bruno Pontecorvo]], [[Ettore Majorana]] and [[Emilio Segrè]], and by Franco Rasetti, whom Fermi had appointed as his assistant</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bonolis|2001|pp=333–335}}At this time, physicists were puzzled by [[beta decay]], in which an [[electron]] was emitted from the [[atomic nucleus]]</span>
