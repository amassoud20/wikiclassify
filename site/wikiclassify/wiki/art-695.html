				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|Robert Schumann in an 1850 [[daguerreotype]]]]'''Robert Schumann'''&lt;ref&gt;Daverio, Grove online</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Daverio, there is no evidence of a middle name &quot;Alexander&quot;, which is given in some sources</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; (8&amp;nbsp;June 1810{{spaced ndash}}29&amp;nbsp;July 1856) was a German composer and influential music critic</span>
				<span class='text'>He is widely regarded as one of the greatest composers of the [[Romantic music|Romantic]] era</span>
				<span class='text'>Schumann left the study of law, intending to pursue a career as a [[virtuoso]] pianist</span>
				<span class='text'>He had been assured by his teacher [[Friedrich Wieck]] that he could become the finest pianist in Europe, but a hand injury ended this dream</span>
				<span class='text'>Schumann then focused his musical energies on composing</span>
				<span class='text'>chumann's published compositions were written exclusively for the piano until 1840; he later composed works for piano and orchestra; many [[Lied]]er (songs for voice and piano); four [[Symphony|symphonies]]; an [[opera]]; and other orchestral, [[choral]], and [[chamber music|chamber]] works</span>
				<span class='text'>Works such as [[Kinderszenen]], [[Album für die Jugend]], [[Blumenstück (Schumann)|Blumenstück]], the [[Sonata]]s and Albumblätter are among his most famous</span>
				<span class='text'>His writings about music appeared mostly in the ''[[Neue Zeitschrift für Musik]]'' (New Journal for Music), a [[Leipzig]]-based publication which he jointly founded</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1840, Schumann married Friedrich Wieck's daughter [[Clara Schumann|Clara]], against the wishes of her father, following a long and acrimonious legal battle, which found in favor of Clara and Robert</span>
				<span class='text'>Clara also composed music and had a considerable concert career as a pianist, the earnings from which formed a substantial part of her father's fortune</span>
				<span class='text'>chumann suffered from a lifelong [[mental disorder]], first manifesting itself in 1833 as a severe [[melancholic depression|melancholic depressive]] episode, which recurred several times alternating with phases of ‘exaltation’ and increasingly also delusional ideas of being poisoned or threatened with metallic items</span>
				<span class='text'>After a suicide attempt in 1854, Schumann was admitted to a [[Psychiatric hospital|mental asylum]], at his own request, in [[Endenich]] near [[Bonn]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Diagnosed with &quot;psychotic [[melancholia]]&quot;, Schumann died two years later in 1856 without having recovered from his mental illness</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|House where Robert Schumann was born in 1810]]Schumann was born in [[Zwickau]], in the [[Kingdom of Saxony]], the fifth and last child of Johanna Christiane (née Schnabel) and August Schumann</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ostwald, page 11&lt;/ref&gt; Schumann began to compose before the age of seven, but his boyhood was spent in the cultivation of literature as much as music – undoubtedly influenced by his father, a bookseller, publisher, and novelist</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Robert Schumann | editor = Konrad Wolff | others = Translated by Paul Rosenfeld | title = On Music and Musicians | year = 1982 | publisher=University of California Press | isbn = 978-0-520-04685-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;Schumann began receiving general musical and piano instruction at the age of seven from Johann Gottfried Kuntzsch, a teacher at the Zwickau high school</span>
				<span class='text'>The boy immediately developed a love of music and worked at creating musical compositions himself, without the aid of Kuntzsch</span>
				<span class='text'>Even though he often disregarded the principles of musical composition, he created works regarded as admirable for his age</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''Universal Journal of Music'' 1850 supplement included a biographical sketch of Schumann that noted, &quot;It has been related that Schumann, as a child, possessed rare taste and talent for portraying feelings and characteristic traits in melody,—ay, he could sketch the different dispositions of his intimate friends by certain figures and passages on the piano so exactly and comically that everyone burst into loud laughter at the similitude of the portrait</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; ([[Wilhelm Joseph von Wasielewski|W</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>von Wasielewski]] 17–19)At age 14, Schumann wrote an essay on the aesthetics of music and also contributed to a volume, edited by his father, titled ''Portraits of Famous Men''</span>
				<span class='text'>While still at school in Zwickau, he read the works of the German poet-philosophers [[Friedrich Schiller]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], as well as [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron]] and the [[Tragedy#Ancient Greek tragedy|Greek tragedians]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His most powerful and permanent literary inspiration was [[Jean Paul Friedrich Richter]], known simply as Jean Paul, a German writer whose influence is seen in Schumann's youthful novels ''Juniusabende'', completed in 1826, and ''Selene''</span>
				<span class='text'>chumann's interest in music was sparked by seeing a performance of [[Ignaz Moscheles]] playing at [[Karlovy Vary|Karlsbad]], and he later developed an interest in the works of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], [[Franz Schubert]] and [[Felix Mendelssohn]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His father, who had encouraged the boy's musical aspirations, died in 1826 when Schumann was 16</span>
				<span class='text'>Neither his mother nor his guardian thereafter encouraged a career in music</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1828 Schumann left school, and after a tour during which he met [[Heinrich Heine]] in Munich, he went to Leipzig to study law (to meet the terms of his inheritance)</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1829 his law studies continued in [[Heidelberg]], where he became a lifelong member of [[:de:Corps Saxo-Borussia Heidelberg|Corps Saxo-Borussia Heidelberg]]</span>

				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|upright|Music room of Schumann]]===1830–34===During [[Eastertide]] 1830 he heard the Italian violinist, violist, guitarist, and composer [[Niccolò Paganini]] play in [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In July he wrote to his mother, &quot;My whole life has been a struggle between Poetry and Prose, or call it Music and Law</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; By Christmas he was back in Leipzig, at age 20 taking piano lessons from his old master Friederich Wieck, who assured him that he would be a successful concert pianist after a few years' study with him</span>
				<span class='text'>uring his studies with Wieck, it has been claimed that Schumann permanently injured a finger on his right hand</span>
				<span class='text'>Wieck claimed that Schumann damaged his finger by the use of a mechanical device designed to strengthen the weakest fingers, a device which held back one finger while he exercised the others</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jensen|first1=Eric Frederick|title=Schumann|date=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195346060|url=https://books</span>

				<span class='text'>l/books?id=xdGlFgzLW6MC&amp;pg=PA70|accessdate=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This claim has been discredited by Clara Schumann, who said that the disability was not due to a mechanical device, and Robert Schumann himself refers to it as &quot;an affliction of the whole hand&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Some have argued that, as the disability appeared to have been chronic and have affected the hand, and not just a finger, it was unlikely to have been caused by a finger strengthening device</span>

				<span class='text'>To this end he began a study of music theory under [[Heinrich Dorn]], a German composer six years his senior and, at that time, conductor of the [[Leipzig Opera]]</span>
				<span class='text'>About this time Schumann considered composing an opera on the subject of [[Hamlet]]</span>
				<span class='text'>===''Papillons''====The fusion of literary ideas with musical ones – known as [[program music]] – may be said to have first taken shape in ''[[Papillons]]'', Op</span>
				<span class='text'>2 (''Butterflies''), a musical portrayal of events in [[Jean Paul]]'s novel ''Die Flegeljahre''</span>
				<span class='text'>In a letter from Leipzig dated April 1832, Schumann bids his brothers &quot;read the last scene in Jean Paul's ''Flegeljahre'' as soon as possible, because the ''Papillons'' are intended as a musical representation of that masquerade</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; This inspiration is foreshadowed to some extent in his first written criticism, an 1831 essay on [[Frédéric Chopin]]'s variations on a theme from [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', published in the ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Here Chopin's work is discussed by imaginary characters created by Schumann himself: Florestan (the embodiment of Schumann's passionate, voluble side) and Eusebius (his dreamy, introspective side) – the counterparts of Vult and Walt in ''Flegeljahre</span>
				<span class='text'>' A third, Meister Raro, is called upon for his opinion</span>
				<span class='text'>Raro may represent either the composer himself, Wieck's daughter [[Clara Schumann|Clara]], or the combination of the two (Cla'''ra''' + '''Ro'''bert)</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Robert Schumann in youth</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|left|A youthful Robert Schumann]]In the winter of 1832, Schumann, 22 at the time, visited relatives in Zwickau and [[Schneeberg, Saxony|Schneeberg]], where he performed the first movement of his ''Symphony in G minor'' (without opus number, known as the &quot;Zwickauer&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>In Zwickau, the music was performed at a concert given by Clara Wieck, who was then just 13 years old</span>
				<span class='text'>On this occasion Clara played bravura Variations by [[Henri Herz]], a composer whom Schumann was already deriding as a philistine</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Robert Schumann, musical Journal&lt;/ref&gt; Schumann's mother said to Clara, &quot;You must marry my Robert one day</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Berthold Litzmann 1910&lt;/ref&gt; Although the ''Symphony in G minor'' was not published by Schumann during his lifetime, it has been played and recorded in recent times</span>
				<span class='text'>he 1833 deaths of Schumann's brother Julius and his sister-in-law Rosalie in the [[Second cholera pandemic (1829-1851)|worldwide cholera pandemic]] brought on a [[Major depressive disorder|severe depressive]] episode</span>
				<span class='text'>===''Die neue Zeitschrift für Musik''====By spring 1834, Schumann had sufficiently recovered to inaugurate ''[[Neue Zeitschrift für Musik|Die Neue Zeitschrift für Musik]]'' (&quot;New Journal for Music&quot;), first published on 3 April 1834</span>
				<span class='text'>Schumann published most of his critical writings in the journal, and often lambasted the popular taste for flashy technical displays from figures whom Schumann perceived as inferior composers</span>
				<span class='text'>Schumann campaigned to revive interest in major composers of the past, including [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]], while he also promoted the work of some contemporary composers, including Chopin (about whom Schumann famously wrote, &quot;Hats off, Gentlemen! A genius!&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Ashkenazy]]'s notes, Favourite Chopin&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hector Berlioz]], whom he praised for creating music of substance</span>
				<span class='text'>On the other hand, Schumann disparaged the school of [[Franz Liszt]] and [[Richard Wagner]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Among Schumann's associates at this time were composers [[Norbert Burgmüller]] and [[Ludwig Schuncke]] (to whom Schumann's ''Toccata in C'' is dedicated)</span>
				<span class='text'>chumann's editorial duties during the summer of 1834 were interrupted by his relations with 16-year-old Ernestine von Fricken — the adopted daughter of a rich Bohemian-born noble — to whom he became engaged</span>
				<span class='text'>Having learned in August 1835 that Ernestine von Fricken was born illegitimate, which meant that she would have no dowry, and fearful that her limited means would force him to earn his living like a &quot;day-labourer&quot;, Schumann made a complete break with her toward the end of the year, due to his growing attraction to 15-year-old Clara Wieck</span>
				<span class='text'>They made mutual declarations of love in December in Zwickau, where Clara appeared in concert</span>
				<span class='text'>His budding romance with Clara was soon brought to an end when her father learned of their trysts during the Christmas holidays; he summarily forbade them further meetings and ordered all correspondence between them burnt</span>
				<span class='text'>===''Carnaval''====[[File:Robert Schumann 1839</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|Robert Schumann, lithograph by [[Josef Kriehuber]], in 1839]]''[[Carnaval (Schumann)|Carnaval]]'', Op</span>
				<span class='text'>9 (1834) is one of Schumann's most characteristic piano works</span>
				<span class='text'>Schumann begins nearly every section of ''Carnaval'' with a [[musical cryptogram]], the musical notes signified in German by the letters that spell [[Aš|Asch]] (A, E-flat, C, and B, or alternatively A-flat, C, and B; in German these are A, Es, C and H, and As, C and H respectively), the [[Bohemia]]n town in which Ernestine was born, and the notes are also the musical letters in Schumann's own name</span>
				<span class='text'>Eusebius and Florestan, the imaginary figures appearing so often in his critical writings, also appear, alongside brilliant imitations of Chopin and Paganini</span>
				<span class='text'>The work comes to a close with a march of the ''[[Davidsbündler]]'' — the league of [[King David]]'s men against the [[Philistines]] — in which may be heard the clear accents of truth in contest with the dull clamour of falsehood embodied in a [[Musical quotation|quotation]] from the seventeenth century ''[[Grossvater Tanz|Grandfather's Dance]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The march, a step nearly always in duple meter, is here in 3/4 time (triple meter)</span>
				<span class='text'>The work ends in joy and a degree of mock-triumph</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''Carnaval'', Schumann went further than in ''Papillons'', by conceiving the story as well as the musical representation (and also displaying a maturation of compositional resource)</span>
				<span class='text'>==1835–39===On 3 October 1835, Schumann met [[Felix Mendelssohn]] at Wieck's house in Leipzig, and his enthusiastic appreciation of that artist was shown with the same generous freedom that distinguished his acknowledgement of Chopin's greatness and most of his other colleagues, and which later prompted him to publicly pronounce the then-unknown [[Johannes Brahms]] a genius</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Clara Schumann (Andreas Staub) freigestellt</span>
				<span class='text'>ng|thumb|left|upright|[[Clara Wieck]] in 1838]]Despite the opposition of Clara's father, she and Robert continued a clandestine relationship which matured into a full-blown romance</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1837, he asked her father's consent to their marriage, but was refused</span>
				<span class='text'>Wieck ridiculed his daughter's wish to &quot;throw herself away on a penniless composer</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}In the series of piano pieces ''[[Fantasiestücke]]'', Op</span>
				<span class='text'>12, Schumann expresses the fusion of literary and musical ideas as embodied conceptions in such pieces as &quot;Warum&quot; and &quot;[[In der Nacht]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>After he had written the latter of these two, he detected in the music the fanciful suggestion of a series of episodes from the myth of [[Hero and Leander]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The collection begins, in &quot;[[Des Abends]]&quot;, with a notable example of Schumann's predilection for rhythmic ambiguity, as unrelieved [[syncopation]] plays heavily against the time signature, (leading to a feeling of 3/8 in a movement marked 2/8) somewhat analogous to that of the first movement of ''[[Faschingsschwank aus Wien]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>After a fable – and the appropriately titled &quot;Dream's Confusion&quot; – the collection ends on an introspective note in the manner of Eusebius</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=December 2010}}In 1837 Schumann published his ''[[Symphonic Studies (Schumann)|Symphonic Studies]]'', a complex set of ''étude''-like variations written in 1834–1835, which demanded a finished piano technique</span>
				<span class='text'>These variations were based on a theme by the adoptive father of Ernestine von Fricken</span>
				<span class='text'>The work – described as &quot;one of the peaks of the piano literature, lofty in conception and faultless in workmanship&quot; [Hutcheson] – was dedicated to the young English composer [[William Sterndale Bennett]], for whom Schumann had had a high regard when they worked together in Leipzig</span>
				<span class='text'>he ''[[Davidsbündlertänze]]'', Op</span>
				<span class='text'>, (also published in 1837 despite the low opus number) literally &quot;Dances of the League of David&quot;, is an embodiment of the struggle between enlightened Romanticism and musical philistinism</span>
				<span class='text'>Schumann credited the two sides of his character with the composition of the work (the more passionate numbers are signed F</span>
				<span class='text'>(Florestan) and the more dreamy signed E</span>
				<span class='text'>(Eusebius))</span>
				<span class='text'>The work begins with the 'motto of C</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> (Clara Wieck) denoting her support for the ideals of the ''Davidsbund''</span>
				<span class='text'> The ''Bund'' was a work of Schumann's imagination, members of which were kindred spirits (as he saw them) such as Chopin, Paganini and Clara, as well as the personalized Florestan and Eusebius</span>
				<span class='text'>'[[Kinderszenen]]'', Op</span>
				<span class='text'>15, completed in 1838 and a favourite of Schumann's piano works, depicts the innocence and playfulness of childhood</span>
				<span class='text'>The &quot;Träumerei&quot; in F major, No</span>
				<span class='text'>7 of the set, is one of the most famous piano pieces ever written, which has been performed in myriad forms and transcriptions</span>
				<span class='text'>It has been the favourite [[Encore (concert)|encore]] of several great pianists, including [[Vladimir Horowitz]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Melodic and deceptively simple, the piece has been described as &quot;complex&quot; in its harmonic structure</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[Alban Berg]], replying to charges that modern music was overly complex, pointed out that ''Kinderszenen'' is constructed on a complex base</span>

				<span class='text'>17, composed in the summer of 1836, is a work of passion and deep pathos, imbued with the spirit of the late Beethoven</span>
				<span class='text'>Schumann intended to use proceeds from sales of the work toward the construction of [[Beethoven Monument, Bonn|a monument to Beethoven]] (who had died in 1827)</span>
				<span class='text'>The first movement of the ''Fantasie'' contains a [[Musical quotation|musical quote]] from Beethoven's song cycle, ''[[An die ferne Geliebte]]'', Op</span>
				<span class='text'>98 (at the Adagio coda, taken from the last song of the cycle)</span>
				<span class='text'>The original titles of the movements were to be &quot;Ruins&quot;, &quot;Triumphal Arch&quot; and &quot;The Starry Crown&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>According to [[Franz Liszt]],&lt;ref&gt;Strelezki: ''Personal Recollections of Chats with Liszt''&lt;/ref&gt; who played the work for Schumann and to whom it was dedicated, the ''Fantasie'' was apt to be played too heavily, and should have a dreamier (''träumerisch'') character than vigorous German pianists tended to impart</span>
				<span class='text'>Liszt also said: &quot;It is a noble work, worthy of Beethoven, whose career, by the way, it is supposed to represent&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Again, according to Hutcheson: &quot;No words can describe the Phantasie, no quotations set forth the majesty of its genius</span>
				<span class='text'>It must suffice to say that it is Schumann's greatest work in large form for piano solo&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=December 2010}}After a visit to [[Vienna]], during which he discovered [[Franz Schubert]]'s previously unknown [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>9 (Schubert)|Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>9 in C]], in 1839 Schumann wrote the ''[[Faschingsschwank aus Wien]]'' (''Carnival Prank from Vienna'')</span>
				<span class='text'>Most of the joke is in the central section of the first movement, in which a thinly veiled reference is made to &quot;[[La Marseillaise]]&quot; (the song had been banned in Vienna due to harsh memories of [[Napoleon]]'s invasion)</span>
				<span class='text'>The festive mood does not preclude moments of melancholic introspection in the Intermezzo</span>
				<span class='text'>fter a long and acrimonious legal battle with her father, Schumann married Clara Wieck on 12 September 1840, at [[Leipzig-Schönefeld|Schönefeld]], the day before her 21st birthday</span>
				<span class='text'>Had they waited another day, they would no longer have required her father's consent</span>
				<span class='text'>Their marriage proved a remarkable business partnership, with Clara acting as an inspiration, critic, and confidant to her husband</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite her delicate appearance, she was an extremely strong-willed and energetic woman, who kept up a demanding schedule of concert tours in between bearing multiple children</span>
				<span class='text'>Two years after they married, Friedrich Wieck at last reconciled himself with the couple, eager to see his grandchildren</span>
				<span class='text'>==1840–49===In the years 1832–1839, Schumann had written almost exclusively for the piano, but in 1840 alone he wrote no less than 138 songs</span>
				<span class='text'>Indeed 1840 (referred to as the ''Liederjahr'' or ''year of song'') is highly significant in Schumann's musical legacy despite his earlier deriding of works for piano and voice as inferior</span>
				<span class='text'>rior to the legal case and subsequent marriage, the lovers exchanged love letters and rendezvoused in secret</span>
				<span class='text'>Robert would often wait in a cafe for hours in a nearby city just to see Clara for a few minutes after one of her concerts</span>
				<span class='text'>The strain of this long courtship (they finally married in 1840), and of its consummation, led to this great outpouring of Lieder (vocal songs with piano accompaniment)</span>
				<span class='text'>This is evident in &quot;Widmung&quot;, for example, where he uses the melody from [[Franz Schubert|Schubert's]] [[Ave Maria (Schubert)|&quot;Ave Maria&quot;]] in the postlude—in homage to Clara</span>
				<span class='text'>Schumann's biographers have attributed the sweetness, the doubt and the despair of these songs to the varying emotions aroused by his love for Clara and the uncertainties of their future together</span>
				<span class='text'>obert and Clara had eight children, Emil (1846–1847), who died at 1 year; Marie (1841–1929); Elise (1843–1928); Julie (1845–1872); Ludwig (1848–1899); Ferdinand (1849–1891); Eugenie (1851–1938); and Felix (1854–1879)</span>

				<span class='text'>The songs ''Belsatzar'', Op</span>
				<span class='text'>57 and ''Die beiden Grenadiere'', Op</span>
				<span class='text'>49, both to Heine's words, show Schumann at his best as a ballad writer, although the dramatic ballad is less congenial to him than the introspective lyric</span>

				<span class='text'>On one occasion, accompanying his wife on a concert tour in Russia, Schumann was asked whether &quot;he too was a musician&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>He devoted 1842 to composing chamber music, including the [[Piano Quintet (Schumann)|Piano Quintet in E flat]], Op</span>
				<span class='text'>44, now one of his best known and most admired works; the Piano Quartet and three string quartets</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1843 he wrote ''[[Paradise and the Peri]]'', his first essay at concerted vocal music, an [[oratorio]] style work based on ''[[Lalla-Rookh]]'' by [[Thomas Moore]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After this, his compositions were not confined to any one form during any particular period</span>
				<span class='text'>he stage in his life when he was deeply engaged in setting Goethe's ''[[Faust]]'' to music (1844–53) was a critical one for his health</span>
				<span class='text'>He spent the first half of 1844 with Clara on tour in Russia</span>
				<span class='text'>On returning to Germany, he abandoned his editorial work and left Leipzig for [[Dresden]], where he suffered from persistent &quot;[[nervous prostration]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>As soon as he began to work, he was seized with fits of shivering and an apprehension of death, experiencing an abhorrence of high places, all metal instruments (even keys), and drugs</span>
				<span class='text'>Schumann's diaries also state that he suffered perpetually from imagining that he had the [[A (musical note)#Designation by octave|note A5]] sounding in his ears</span>
				<span class='text'>is state of unease and [[neurasthenia]] is reflected in his [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>2 (Schumann)|Symphony in C]], numbered second, but third in order of composition, in which the composer explores states of exhaustion, obsession and depression, culminating in Beethovenian spiritual triumph</span>
				<span class='text'>Also published in 1845 was his [[Piano Concerto (Schumann)|Piano Concerto in A minor, Op</span>
				<span class='text'>54]], originally conceived and performed as a one-movement ''Fantasy for Piano and Orchestra'' in 1841</span>
				<span class='text'>It is one of the most popular and oft-recorded of all piano concertos; pace Hutcheson &quot;Schumann achieved a masterly work and we inherited the finest piano concerto since Mozart and Beethoven&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1846, he felt he had recovered</span>
				<span class='text'>In the winter, the Schumanns revisited Vienna, traveling to [[Prague]] and Berlin in the spring of 1847 and in the summer to Zwickau, where he was received with enthusiasm</span>
				<span class='text'>This pleased him, since at that time he was famous in only Dresden and Leipzig</span>
				<span class='text'>is only opera, ''[[Genoveva]]'', Op</span>
				<span class='text'>81, was written in 1848</span>
				<span class='text'>In it, Schumann attempted to abolish [[recitative]], which he regarded as an interruption to the musical flow (an influence on [[Richard Wagner]]; Schumann's consistently flowing melody can be seen as a forerunner to Wagner's ''Melos'')</span>
				<span class='text'>The subject of ''Genoveva''—based on [[Ludwig Tieck]] and [[Christian Friedrich Hebbel]]—was not an ideal choice</span>
				<span class='text'>The text is often considered to lack dramatic qualities; the work has not remained in the repertoire</span>
				<span class='text'>As early as 1842 the possibilities of German opera had been keenly realized by Schumann, who wrote, &quot;Do you know my prayer as an artist, night and morning? It is called 'German Opera</span>
				<span class='text'> Here is a real field for enterprise </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>something simple, profound, German&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>And in his notebook of suggestions for the text of operas are found amongst others: ''[[Nibelung]]en'', ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'' and ''[[Till Eulenspiegel]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>he music to [[Lord Byron|Byron]]'s ''[[Manfred]]'' was written in 1849, the overture of which is one of Schumann's most frequently performed orchestral works</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[May Uprising in Dresden|insurrection of Dresden]] caused Schumann to move to [[Kreischa]], a little village a few miles outside the city</span>
				<span class='text'>In August 1849, on the occasion of the centenary of Goethe's birth, such scenes of Schumann's ''[[Scenes from Goethe's Faust]]'' as were already completed were performed in Dresden, Leipzig and [[Weimar]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Liszt gave him assistance and encouragement</span>
				<span class='text'>The rest of the work was written later in 1849, and the overture (which Schumann described as &quot;one of the sturdiest of [his] creations&quot;) in 1853</span>
				<span class='text'>==After 1850===From 1850 to 1854, Schumann composed in a wide variety of genres</span>
				<span class='text'>Critics have disputed the quality of his work at this time; a widely held view has been that his music showed signs of mental breakdown and creative decay</span>
				<span class='text'>More recently, critics have suggested that the changes in style may be explained by &quot;lucid experimentation&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Daverio, Grove online, 19&lt;/ref&gt;In 1850, Schumann succeeded [[Ferdinand Hiller]] as musical director at [[Düsseldorf]], but he was a poor conductor and quickly aroused the opposition of the musicians</span>
				<span class='text'>According to [[Harold C</span>
				<span class='text'>Schonberg]] (''The Great Conductors'') &quot;The great composer was impossible on the platform </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>There is something heartrending about poor Schumann's epochal inefficiency as a conductor</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}  His contract was eventually terminated</span>
				<span class='text'>From 1851 to 1853 he visited Switzerland, Belgium and Leipzig</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1851 he completed his [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>3 (Schumann)|Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>3, &quot;Rhenish&quot;]] (a work containing five movements and whose 4th movement is apparently intended to represent an episcopal coronation ceremony)</span>
				<span class='text'>He revised what would be published as his [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>4 (Schumann)|fourth symphony]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 30 September 1853, the 20-year-old composer [[Johannes Brahms]] arrived unannounced on the door of the Schumanns carrying a letter of introduction from violinist [[Joseph Joachim]]</span>
				<span class='text'>(Schumann was not at home, and would not meet Brahms until the next day</span>
				<span class='text'> Brahms amazed Clara and Robert with his music, stayed with them for several weeks, and became a close family friend</span>
				<span class='text'>(He later worked closely with Clara to popularize Schumann's compositions during her long widowhood</span>
				<span class='text'>During this time Schumann, Brahms and Schumann's pupil [[Albert Dietrich]] collaborated on the composition of the ''[[F-A-E Sonata|''F-A-E'' Sonata]]'' for Joachim; Schumann also published an article, &quot;Neue Bahnen&quot; (&quot;New Paths&quot;) in the ''Neue Zeitschrift'' (his first article in many years), hailing the unknown young Brahms from Hamburg, a man who had published nothing, as &quot;the Chosen One&quot; who &quot;was destined to give ideal expression to the times</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Schumann's &quot;Artikel Neue Bahnen&quot;, 28 October 1853&lt;/ref&gt; It was an extraordinary way to present Brahms to the musical world, setting up great expectations which he did not fulfill for many years</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Brahms' [[A German Requiem (Brahms)|''A German Requiem'']], published in 1868, brought the first widespread recognition of his talent</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In January 1854, Schumann went to [[Hanover]], where he heard a performance of his ''Paradise and the Peri'' organized by Joachim and Brahms</span>
				<span class='text'>Two years later at Schumann's request, the work received its first English performance conducted by [[William Sterndale Bennett]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Bonn graveyard robert schumann 20080509</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|Grave of Robert and Clara Schumann at [[Bonn]]]]Schumann returned to Düsseldorf and began to edit his complete works and make an anthology on the subject of music</span>
				<span class='text'>He suffered a renewal of the symptoms that had threatened him earlier</span>
				<span class='text'>Besides the single note sounding in his ear (possibly evidence of [[tinnitus]]{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}), he imagined that voices sounded in his ear and he heard angelic music</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=May 2013}} One night he suddenly left his bed, having dreamt or imagined that a ghost (purportedly the spirit of either Schubert or Mendelssohn) had dictated a &quot;spirit theme&quot; to him</span>
				<span class='text'>The theme was one he had used several times before: in his Second String Quartet, again in his ''Lieder-Album für die Jugend'', and finally in the slow movement of his [[Violin Concerto (Schumann)|Violin Concerto]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In the days leading up to his suicide attempt, Schumann wrote five variations on this theme for the piano, his last published work, today known as the ''[[Geistervariationen]]'' (Ghost Variations)</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|Robert Schumann monument at his birthplace [[Zwickau]], Germany]]===Final illness and death===In late February 1854, Schumann's symptoms increased, the angelic visions sometimes being replaced by demonic visions</span>
				<span class='text'>He warned Clara that he feared he might do her harm</span>
				<span class='text'>On 27 February 1854, he attempted suicide by throwing himself from a bridge into the [[Rhine]] River</span>
				<span class='text'>Rescued by boatmen and taken home, he asked to be taken to an asylum for the insane</span>
				<span class='text'>He entered Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Franz Richarz's sanatorium in [[Endenich]], a quarter of [[Bonn]], and remained there until he died on 29 July 1856 at the age of 46</span>
				<span class='text'>During his confinement, he was not allowed to see Clara</span>
				<span class='text'>She finally visited him two days before his death</span>
				<span class='text'>He appeared to recognize her, but was able to speak only a few words</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Daverio, Grove online, 20&lt;/ref&gt;Given his reported symptoms, one modern view is that his death was a result of [[syphilis]], which he may have contracted during his student days, and which would have remained latent during most of his marriage</span>

				<span class='text'>151</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; According to studies by the musicologist and literary scholar [[Eric Sams]], Schumann's symptoms during his terminal illness and death appear consistent with those of [[mercury poisoning]], mercury at this time being a common treatment for syphilis and other conditions</span>
				<span class='text'>Another possibility is that his neurological problems were the result of an intracranial mass</span>
				<span class='text'>A report by Janisch and Nauhaus on Schumann's autopsy indicates that he had a &quot;gelatinous&quot; tumor at the base of the brain; it may have represented a [[colloid cyst]], a [[craniopharyngioma]], a [[chordoma]], or a chordoid [[meningioma]]</span>
