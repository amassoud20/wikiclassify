				<span class='text'>72&lt;/ref&gt; to establish a Unitarian Christian church there</span>
				<span class='text'>His father, [[Henry Ware Eliot]] (1843–1919), was a successful businessman, president and treasurer of the Hydraulic-Press Brick Company in St</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis; his mother, [[Charlotte Champe Stearns]] (1843–1929), wrote poetry and was a [[social worker]], a new profession in the early twentieth century</span>
				<span class='text'>Eliot was the last of six surviving children; his parents were both 44 years old when he was born</span>
				<span class='text'>His four sisters were between eleven and nineteen years older; his brother was eight years older</span>
				<span class='text'>Known to family and friends as Tom, he was the namesake of his maternal grandfather, Thomas Stearns</span>
				<span class='text'>everal factors are responsible for Eliot's infatuation with literature during his childhood</span>
				<span class='text'>First, he had to overcome physical limitations as a child</span>
				<span class='text'>Struggling from a congenital double [[inguinal hernia]], he could not participate in many physical activities and thus was prevented from socialising with his peers</span>
				<span class='text'>As he was often isolated, his love for literature developed</span>
				<span class='text'>Once he learned to read, the young boy immediately became obsessed with books and was absorbed in tales depicting savages, the Wild West, or [[Mark Twain]]'s thrill-seeking [[Tom Sawyer]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Worthen|first=John|title=T</span>

				<span class='text'>Eliot: A Short Biography|year=2009|publisher=Haus Publishing|location=London|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his memoir of Eliot, his friend Robert Sencourt comments that the young Eliot &quot;would often curl up in the window-seat behind an enormous book, setting the drug of dreams against the pain of living</span>

				<span class='text'>Eliot, A Memoir|year=1971|publisher=Garnstone Limited|location=London|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, Eliot credited his hometown with fuelling his literary vision: &quot;It is self-evident that St</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis affected me more deeply than any other environment has ever done</span>
				<span class='text'>I feel that there is something in having passed one's childhood beside the [[Mississippi River|big river]], which is incommunicable to those people who have not</span>
				<span class='text'>I consider myself fortunate to have been born here, rather than in Boston, or New York, or London</span>

				<span class='text'>6</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, from the onset, literature was an essential part of Eliot's childhood and both his disability and location influenced him</span>
				<span class='text'>rom 1898 to 1905, Eliot attended [[Mary Institute and St</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis Country Day School|Smith Academy]], where his studies included Latin, Ancient Greek, French, and German</span>
				<span class='text'>He began to write poetry when he was fourteen under the influence of [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward Fitzgerald]]'s ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]]'', a translation of the poetry of [[Omar Khayyam]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He said the results were gloomy and despairing and he destroyed them</span>

				<span class='text'>Alfred Prufrock&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the character Prufrock seems to be middle-aged, Eliot wrote most of the poem when he was only twenty-two</span>
				<span class='text'>Its now-famous opening lines, comparing the evening sky to &quot;a patient etherised upon a table&quot;, were considered shocking and offensive, especially at a time when [[Georgian Poetry]] was hailed for its derivations of the nineteenth century [[romanticism|Romantic Poets]]</span>
				<span class='text'>he poem follows the conscious experience of a man, Prufrock (relayed in the &quot;[[Stream of consciousness writing|stream of consciousness]]&quot; form characteristic of the [[Modernists]]), lamenting his physical and intellectual inertia with the recurrent theme of carnal love unattained</span>
				<span class='text'>Critical opinion is divided as to whether the narrator leaves his residence during the course of the narration</span>
				<span class='text'>The locations described can be interpreted either as actual physical experiences, mental recollections, or as symbolic images from the unconscious mind, as, for example, in the refrain &quot;In the room the women come and go&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>he poem's structure was heavily influenced by Eliot's extensive reading of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] and refers to a number of literary works, including ''[[Hamlet]]'' and those of the French Symbolists</span>
				<span class='text'>Its reception in London can be gauged from an unsigned review in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' on 21 June 1917</span>

				<span class='text'>The poem is often read as a representation of the disillusionment of the post-war generation</span>

				<span class='text'>Published in 1930, it deals with the struggle that ensues when one who has lacked faith acquires it</span>
				<span class='text'>Sometimes referred to as Eliot's &quot;conversion poem&quot;, it is richly but ambiguously allusive, and deals with the aspiration to move from spiritual barrenness to hope for human [[salvation]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Eliot's style of writing in ''Ash-Wednesday'' showed a marked shift from the poetry he had written prior to his 1927 conversion, and his post-conversion style would continue in a similar vein</span>
				<span class='text'>His style was to become less ironic, and the poems would no longer be populated by multiple characters in dialogue</span>
				<span class='text'>His subject matter would also become more focused on Eliot's spiritual concerns and his Christian faith</span>
				<span class='text'>any critics were particularly enthusiastic about ''Ash-Wednesday''</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Edwin Muir]] maintained that it is one of the most moving poems Eliot wrote, and perhaps the &quot;most perfect&quot;, though it was not well received by everyone</span>

				<span class='text'>This first edition had an illustration of the author on the cover</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1954, the composer [[Alan Rawsthorne]] set six of the poems for speaker and orchestra in a work entitled ''Practical Cats''</span>
				<span class='text'>After Eliot's death, the book was adapted as the basis of the musical ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], first produced in London's West End in 1981 and opening on [[broadway theatre|Broadway]] the following year</span>
				<span class='text'>==''Four Quartets''==={{Main|Four Quartets}}Eliot regarded ''Four Quartets'' as his masterpiece, and it is the work that led to his being awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=EB/&gt; It consists of four long poems, each first published separately: ''[[Burnt Norton]]'' (1936), ''[[East Coker (poem)|East Coker]]'' (1940), ''[[Four Quartets#The Dry Salvages|The Dry Salvages]]'' (1941) and ''[[Little Gidding (poem)|Little Gidding]]'' (1942)</span>
				<span class='text'>Each has five sections</span>
				<span class='text'>Although they resist easy characterisation, each poem includes meditations on the nature of time in some important respect—[[theological]], historical, physical—and its relation to the human condition</span>
				<span class='text'>Each poem is associated with one of the four [[classical elements]]: air, earth, water, and fire</span>
				<span class='text'>'[[Burnt Norton]]'' is a meditative poem that begins with the narrator trying to focus on the present moment while walking through a garden, focusing on images and sounds like the bird, the roses, clouds, and an empty pool</span>
				<span class='text'>The narrator's meditation leads him/her to reach &quot;the still point&quot; in which he doesn't try to get anywhere or to experience place and/or time, instead experiencing &quot;a grace of sense&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>In the final section, the narrator contemplates the arts (&quot;Words&quot; and &quot;music&quot;) as they relate to time</span>
				<span class='text'>The narrator focuses particularly on the poet's art of manipulating &quot;Words [which] strain, / Crack and sometimes break, under the burden [of time], under the tension, slip, slide, perish, decay with imprecision, [and] will not stay in place, / Will not stay still</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; By comparison, the narrator concludes that &quot;Love is itself unmoving, / Only the cause and end of movement, / Timeless, and undesiring</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;''[[East Coker (poem)|East Coker]]'' continues the examination of time and meaning, focusing in a famous passage on the nature of language and poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>Out of darkness, Eliot offers a solution: &quot;I said to my soul, be still, and wait without hope</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;''[[The Dry Salvages]]'' treats the element of water, via images of river and sea</span>
				<span class='text'>It strives to contain opposites: &quot;The past and future / Are conquered, and reconciled</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;''[[Little Gidding (poem)|Little Gidding]]'' (the element of fire) is the most anthologised of the Quartets</span>
				<span class='text'>Eliot's experiences as an air raid warden in [[The Blitz]] power the poem, and he imagines meeting [[Dante]] during the German bombing</span>
				<span class='text'>The beginning of the Quartets (&quot;Houses / Are removed, destroyed&quot;) had become a violent everyday experience; this creates an animation, where for the first time he talks of Love as the driving force behind all experience</span>
				<span class='text'>From this background, the Quartets end with an affirmation of [[Julian of Norwich]]: &quot;All shall be well and / All manner of thing&lt;!-- NOT &quot;things&quot; - Collected Poems, p</span>
				<span class='text'>09 --&gt; shall be well</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;The ''Four Quartets'' cannot be understood without reference to Christian thought, traditions, and history</span>
				<span class='text'>Eliot draws upon the theology, art, symbolism and language of such figures as Dante, and mystics [[St</span>
				<span class='text'>John of the Cross]] and [[Julian of Norwich]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The &quot;deeper communion&quot; sought in ''East Coker'', the &quot;hints and whispers of children, the sickness that must grow worse in order to find healing&quot;, and the exploration which inevitably leads us home all point to the pilgrim's path along the road of [[sanctification]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Plays=={{Main|Sweeney Agonistes|Murder in the Cathedral|The Rock (play)|The Family Reunion|The Cocktail Party|The Confidential Clerk|The Elder Statesman}}With the important exception of ''Four Quartets'', Eliot directed much of his creative energies after ''Ash Wednesday'' to writing plays in verse, mostly comedies or plays with redemptive endings</span>
				<span class='text'>He was long a critic and admirer of [[Elizabethan]] and [[Literature in English#Jacobean literature|Jacobean]] verse drama; witness his allusions to [[John Webster|Webster]], [[Thomas Middleton]], [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Thomas Kyd]] in ''The Waste Land''</span>
				<span class='text'>In a 1933 lecture he said &quot;Every poet would like, I fancy, to be able to think that he had some direct social utility </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>He would like to be something of a popular entertainer, and be able to think his own thoughts behind a tragic or a comic mask</span>
				<span class='text'>He would like to convey the pleasures of poetry, not only to a larger audience, but to larger groups of people collectively; and the theatre is the best place in which to do it</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;upuc&quot;&gt;Eliot, T</span>
				<span class='text'>S</span>
				<span class='text'>''The Use of Poetry and the Use of Criticism'', Harvard University Press, 1933 (penultimate paragraph)&lt;/ref&gt;After ''The Waste Land'' (1922), he wrote that he was &quot;now feeling toward a new form and style&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>One project he had in mind was writing a play in verse, using some of the rhythms of early [[jazz]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The play featured &quot;Sweeney&quot;, a character who had appeared in a number of his poems</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Eliot did not finish the play, he did publish two scenes from the piece</span>
				<span class='text'>These scenes, titled ''Fragment of a Prologue'' (1926) and ''Fragment of an Agon'' (1927), were published together in 1932 as ''[[Sweeney Agonistes]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Eliot noted that this was not intended to be a one-act play, it is sometimes performed as one</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Gallup/&gt;A pageant play by Eliot called ''The Rock'' was performed in 1934 for the benefit of churches in the [[Diocese of London]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Much of it was a collaborative effort; Eliot accepted credit only for the authorship of one scene and the choruses</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Gallup/&gt; [[George Bell (bishop)|George Bell]], the [[Bishop of Chichester]], had been instrumental in connecting Eliot with producer [[E</span>
				<span class='text'>Martin Browne]] for the production of ''The Rock'', and later commissioned Eliot to write another play for the [[Canterbury Festival]] in 1935</span>
				<span class='text'>This one, ''Murder in the Cathedral'', concerning the death of the martyr, [[Thomas Becket]], was more under Eliot's control</span>
				<span class='text'>Eliot biographer [[Peter Ackroyd]] comments that &quot;for [Eliot], ''Murder in the Cathedral'' and succeeding verse plays offered a double advantage; it allowed him to practice poetry but it also offered a convenient home for his religious sensibility</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;learner</span>
				<span class='text'>rg&quot;/&gt; After this, he worked on more &quot;commercial&quot; plays for more general audiences: ''The Family Reunion'' (1939), ''The Cocktail Party'' (1949), ''The Confidential Clerk'', (1953) and ''The Elder Statesman'' (1958) (the latter three were produced by [[Henry Sherek]] and directed by [[E</span>

				<span class='text'>The Broadway production in New York of ''[[The Cocktail Party]]'' received the 1950 [[Tony Award]] for Best Play</span>
				<span class='text'>egarding his method of playwriting, Eliot explained, &quot;If I set out to write a play, I start by an act of choice</span>
				<span class='text'>I settle upon a particular emotional situation, out of which characters and a plot will emerge</span>
				<span class='text'>And then lines of poetry may come into being: not from the original impulse but from a secondary stimulation of the unconscious mind</span>

				<span class='text'>rg&quot;/&gt;==Literary criticism==Eliot also made significant contributions to the field of [[literary criticism]], strongly influencing the school of [[New Criticism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>While somewhat self-deprecating and minimising of his work—he once said his criticism was merely a &quot;by-product&quot; of his &quot;private poetry-workshop&quot;—Eliot is considered by some to be one of the greatest literary critics of the twentieth century</span>

				<span class='text'>18, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;In his critical essay &quot;[[Tradition and the Individual Talent]]&quot;, Eliot argues that art must be understood not in a vacuum, but in the context of previous pieces of art</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;In a peculiar sense [an artist or poet] </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>must inevitably be judged by the standards of the past</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=bartleby1/&gt; This essay was an important influence over the New Criticism by introducing the idea that the value of a work of art must be viewed in the context of the artist's previous works, a &quot;simultaneous order&quot; of works (i</span>

				<span class='text'> &quot;tradition&quot;)</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Also important to New Criticism was the idea—as articulated in Eliot's essay &quot;[[Hamlet and His Problems]]&quot;—of an &quot;[[objective correlative]]&quot;, which posits a connection among the words of the text and events, states of mind, and experiences</span>

				<span class='text'>ore generally, New Critics took a cue from Eliot in regard to his &quot;'classical' ideals and his religious thought; his attention to the poetry and drama of the early seventeenth century; his deprecation of the Romantics, especially Shelley; his proposition that good poems constitute 'not a turning loose of emotion but an escape from emotion'; and his insistence that 'poets</span>

				<span class='text'>Ronald Bush notes that &quot;'The Waste Land' was at first correctly perceived as a work of jazz-like syncopation—and, like 1920s [[jazz]], essentially iconoclastic</span>

				<span class='text'>du&quot;/&gt; Some critics, like [[Edmund Wilson]], [[Conrad Aiken]], and [[Gilbert Seldes]] thought it was the best poetry being written in the English language while others thought it was esoteric and wilfully difficult</span>

				<span class='text'>In regard to &quot;The Waste Land&quot;, Wilson admits its flaws (&quot;its lack of structural unity&quot;), but concluded, &quot;I doubt whether there is a single other poem of equal length by a contemporary American which displays so high and so varied a mastery of English verse</span>

				<span class='text'>He writes, &quot;Sometimes regarded as too academic ([[William Carlos Williams]]'s view), Eliot was also frequently criticized for a deadening [[neoclassicism]] (as he himself—perhaps just as unfairly—had criticized [[John Milton|Milton]])</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the multifarious tributes from practicing poets of many schools published during his centenary in 1988 was a strong indication of the intimidating continued presence of his poetic voice</span>

				<span class='text'>For instance, the editors of ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature'' write, &quot;There is no disagreement on [Eliot's] importance as one of the great renovators of the English poetry dialect, whose influence on a whole generation of poets, critics, and intellectuals generally was enormous</span>
				<span class='text'>[However] his range as a poet [was] limited, and his interest in the great middle ground of human experience (as distinct from the extremes of saint and sinner) [was] deficient</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Despite this criticism, these scholars also acknowledge &quot;[Eliot's] poetic cunning, his fine craftsmanship, his original accent, his historical and representative importance as ''the'' poet of the modern [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolist]]-[[Metaphysical poets|Metaphysical]] tradition&quot;</span>
