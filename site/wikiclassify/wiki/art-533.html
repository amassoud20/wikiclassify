				<span class='text'>The film was produced by [[Rick Heinrichs]], whom Burton had befriended while working in the concept art department at Disney</span>
				<span class='text'>The film was shown at the Chicago Film Festival and released, alongside the teen drama ''[[Tex (film)|Tex]]'', for two weeks in one Los Angeles cinema</span>
				<span class='text'>This was followed by Burton's first live-action production ''[[Hansel and Gretel (1982 film)|Hansel and Gretel]]'', a Japanese-themed adaptation of the [[Brothers Grimm]] [[Hansel and Gretel|fairy tale]] for the [[Disney Channel]], which climaxes in a [[kung fu]] fight between Hansel and Gretel and the witch</span>
				<span class='text'>Having aired once in 1983 at 10:30 pm on Halloween and promptly shelved, prints of the film are extremely difficult to locate, fueling rumors that the project did not exist</span>
				<span class='text'>The short would finally go on public display in 2009 at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], and again in 2011 as part of the Tim Burton art exhibit at [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art|LACMA]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=September 2015}}Burton's next live-action short, ''[[Frankenweenie (1984 film)|Frankenweenie]]'', was released in 1984</span>

				<span class='text'>However, after [[Martin Scorsese]]'s project ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ (film)|The Last Temptation of Christ]]'' was cancelled (though later completed and released in 1988), Scorsese showed an interest in directing ''After Hours''</span>
				<span class='text'>Respectfully, Burton bowed out</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=September 2015}}===''Pee-wee's Big Adventure''==={{Main|Pee-wee's Big Adventure}}Not long after, actor [[Paul Reubens]] saw ''Vincent'' and ''Frankenweenie'' and chose Burton to direct the cinematic spin-off of his popular character [[Pee-wee Herman]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Pee-wee Herman gained mainstream popularity with a successful stage show at [[The Groundlings]] and then [[the Roxy]] which was later turned into an [[The Pee-wee Herman Show|HBO special]]</span>

				<span class='text'>==''Beetlejuice''==={{Main|Beetlejuice}}After directing episodes for the [[Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1985 TV series)|revitalized version]] of '50s/'60s anthology horror series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' and [[Shelley Duvall]]'s ''[[Faerie Tale Theatre]]'', Burton received his next big project: ''[[Beetlejuice]]'' (1988), a supernatural [[comedy horror]] about a young couple forced to cope with life after death, and the family of pretentious yuppies who invade their treasured New England home</span>
				<span class='text'>Their teenage daughter Lydia ([[Winona Ryder]]) has an obsession with death which allows her to see the deceased couple</span>
				<span class='text'>Starring [[Alec Baldwin]] and [[Geena Davis]], and featuring [[Michael Keaton]] as the obnoxious bio-exorcist Beetlejuice, the film grossed $80&amp;nbsp;million on a relatively low budget and won an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup|Best Makeup]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It would be converted into a [[Beetlejuice (TV series)|cartoon of the same name]], with Burton playing a role as executive producer, that ran on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and later [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==''Batman''==={{Main|Batman (1989 film)}}Burton's ability to produce hits with low budgets impressed studio executives, and he received his first big budget film, ''Batman''</span>
				<span class='text'>The production was plagued with problems</span>
				<span class='text'>Burton repeatedly clashed with the film's producers, [[Jon Peters]] and [[Peter Guber]], but the most notable debacle involved casting</span>
				<span class='text'>For the title role, Burton chose to cast Michael Keaton as [[Batman]] following their previous collaboration in ''Beetlejuice'', despite Keaton's average physique, inexperience with action films, and reputation as a comic actor</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Burton won in the end, the furor over the casting provoked enormous fan animosity, to the extent that Warner Brothers' share price slumped</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Burton had considered it ridiculous to cast a &quot;bulked-up&quot; ultra-masculine man as Batman, insisting that the Caped Crusader should be an ordinary (albeit fabulously wealthy) man who dressed up in an elaborate bat costume to frighten criminals</span>
				<span class='text'>Burton cast [[Jack Nicholson]] as [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]] ([[Tim Curry]] being his second choice) in a move that helped assuage fans' fears, as well as attracting older audiences not as interested in a [[superhero film]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}When the film opened in June 1989, it was backed by the biggest marketing and merchandising campaign in film history at the time, and became one of the biggest box office hits of all time, grossing well over US$250&amp;nbsp;million in the US alone and $400&amp;nbsp;million worldwide (numbers not adjusted for inflation) and earning critical acclaim for the performances of both Keaton and Nicholson, as well as the film's production aspects, which won the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Art Direction|Best Art Direction]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The success of the film helped establish Burton as a profitable director, and it also proved to be a huge influence on future superhero films, which eschewed the bright, all-American heroism of [[Richard Donner]]'s ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' for a grimmer, more realistic look and characters with more psychological depth</span>
				<span class='text'>It also became a major inspiration for the successful 1990s cartoon ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', in as much as the darkness of the picture and its sequel allowed for a darker Batman on television</span>
				<span class='text'>urton claimed that the graphic novel ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke|The Killing Joke]]'' was a major influence on his film adaptation of ''Batman'':&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I was never a giant comic book fan, but I've always loved the image of Batman and the Joker</span>
				<span class='text'>The reason I've never been a comic book fan&amp;nbsp;– and I think it started when I was a child&amp;nbsp;– is because I could never tell which box I was supposed to read</span>
				<span class='text'>I don't know if it was [[dyslexia]] or whatever, but that's why I loved ''The Killing Joke'', because for the first time I could tell which one to read</span>
				<span class='text'>It's my favorite</span>
				<span class='text'>It's the first comic I've ever loved</span>
				<span class='text'>And the success of those graphic novels made our ideas more acceptable</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;==1990s=====''Edward Scissorhands''==={{Main|Edward Scissorhands}}In 1990, Burton co-wrote (with [[Caroline Thompson]]) and directed ''Edward Scissorhands'', re-uniting with Winona Ryder from ''Beetlejuice''</span>
				<span class='text'>His friend [[Johnny Depp]], a teen idol at the end of the 1980s due primarily to his work on the hit TV series ''[[21 Jump Street]]'', was cast in the title role of Edward, who was the creation of an eccentric and old-fashioned inventor (played by [[Vincent Price]] in one of his last screen appearances)</span>
				<span class='text'>Edward looked human, but was left with scissors in the place of hands due to the untimely death of his creator</span>
				<span class='text'>Set in suburbia (and shot in [[Lakeland, Florida]]), the film is largely seen as Burton's autobiography of his childhood in Burbank</span>
				<span class='text'>Depp wrote a similar comment in the foreword to Mark Salisbury's book, ''Burton on Burton'', regarding his first meeting with Burton over the casting of the film</span>
				<span class='text'>''Edward'' is considered one of Burton's best movies by some critics</span>

				<span class='text'>n 2004, [[Matthew Bourne]] came to Burton with the idea to turn the story of Edward into a ballet</span>
				<span class='text'>In 2005, the ballet first aired</span>
				<span class='text'>It has now toured the UK, the US, Canada, Australia and parts of Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>==''Batman Returns''==={{Main|Batman Returns}}The day Warner Brothers declined to make the more personal ''Scissorhands'' even after the success of ''Batman'', Burton finally agreed to direct the sequel for Warner Brothers on the condition that he would be granted total control</span>
				<span class='text'>The result was ''Batman Returns''which featured Michael Keaton returning as the Dark Knight, and a new triad of villains: [[Danny DeVito]] (as [[Penguin (comics)|the Penguin]]), [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] (as [[Catwoman]]) and [[Christopher Walken]] as [[Max Shreck]], an evil corporate tycoon and original character created for the film (similar to ''[[Superman III]]''{{'}}s [[Ross Webster]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Darker and considerably more personal than its predecessor, concerns were raised that the film was too scary for children</span>
				<span class='text'>Audiences were even more uncomfortable at the film's overt sexuality, personified by the sleek, fetish-inspired styling of Catwoman's costume</span>
				<span class='text'>One critic remarked, &quot;too many villains spoiled the Batman&quot;, highlighting Burton's decision to focus the storyline more on the villains instead of Batman</span>
				<span class='text'>The film also polarized the fanbase, with some loving the darkness and quirkiness, while others felt it was not true to the core aspects of the source material</span>
				<span class='text'>Burton made many changes to the Penguin which would subsequently be applied to the character in both comics and television</span>
				<span class='text'>While in the comics, he was an ordinary man, Burton created a freak of nature resembling a penguin with webbed, flipper-like fingers, a hooked, beak-like nose, and a penguin-like body (resulting in a rotund, obese man)</span>
				<span class='text'>Released in 1992, ''Batman Returns'' grossed $282</span>
				<span class='text'>&amp;nbsp;million worldwide, making it another financial success, though not to the extent of its predecessor</span>
				<span class='text'>==''The Nightmare Before Christmas''==={{Main|The Nightmare Before Christmas}}Next, Burton wrote and produced (but did not direct, due to schedule constraints on ''Batman Returns'') ''The Nightmare Before Christmas'' (1993) for Disney, originally meant to be a children's book in rhyme</span>
				<span class='text'>The film was directed by [[Henry Selick]] and written by [[Caroline Thompson]], based on Burton's original story, world and characters</span>
				<span class='text'>The film received positive reviews for the film's stop motion animation, musical score and original storyline and was a box office success, grossing $50&amp;nbsp;million</span>
				<span class='text'>Burton collaborated with Selick again for ''[[James and the Giant Peach (film)|James and the Giant Peach]]'' (1996), which Burton co-produced</span>
				<span class='text'>The film helped to generate a renewed interest in stop motion animation</span>
				<span class='text'>==''Cabin Boy''==={{Main|Cabin Boy}}In 1994, Burton and frequent co-producer [[Denise Di Novi]] produced the 1994 fantasy-comedy ''Cabin Boy'', starring comedian [[Chris Elliott]] and directed/written by [[Adam Resnick]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Burton was originally supposed to direct the film after seeing Elliott perform on ''[[Get a Life (TV series)|Get a Life]]'', but handed the directing responsibility to Resnick once he was offered ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The film was almost entirely panned by critics, even earning Chris Elliott a 1995 [[Golden Raspberry Award|Razzie Award]] for &quot;Worst New Star&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|109361|section=awards|Cabin Boy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film also has a 45% &quot;rotten&quot; rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], indicating more mixed contemporary reviews</span>
				<span class='text'>==''Ed Wood''==={{Main|Ed Wood (film)}}His next film, ''Ed Wood'' (1994), was of a much smaller scale, depicting the life of [[Ed Wood]], a filmmaker sometimes called &quot;the worst director of all time&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Starring Johnny Depp in the title role, the film is an homage to the low-budget science fiction and horror films of Burton's childhood, and handles its comical protagonist and his motley band of collaborators with surprising fondness and sensitivity</span>
				<span class='text'>Owing to creative squabbles during the making of ''The Nightmare Before Christmas'', Danny Elfman declined to score ''Ed Wood'', and the assignment went to [[Howard Shore]]</span>
				<span class='text'>While a commercial failure at the time of its release, ''Ed Wood'' was well received by critics</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Martin Landau]] received an Academy Award in the Best Supporting Actor category for his portrayal of [[Bela Lugosi]], and the film received the award for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup|Best Makeup]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==''Batman Forever''==={{Main|Batman Forever}}Despite Burton's intention to still lead the ''Batman'' franchise, Warner Bros</span>
				<span class='text'>considered ''Batman Returns'' too dark and unsafe for children</span>
				<span class='text'>To attract the young audience, it was decided that [[Joel Schumacher]], who had directed films like ''[[The Client (1994 film)|The Client]]'', lead the third film, while Burton would only produce it in conjunction with [[Peter MacGregor-Scott]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Following this change and the changes made by the new director, Michael Keaton resigned from the lead role and was replaced by [[Val Kilmer]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Filming began in late 1994 with new actors: [[Tommy Lee Jones]] as Harvey Dent/Two-Face, [[Nicole Kidman]] as Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Chase Meridian, [[Chris O'Donnell]] as Dick Grayson/Robin and [[Jim Carrey]] as Edward Nygma/ The Riddler; the only two actors who returned were [[Pat Hingle]] as Commissioner Gordon and [[Michael Gough]] as Alfred Pennyworth</span>
				<span class='text'>The film, a combination of the darkness that characterized the saga and colors and neon signs proposed by Schumacher, was a huge box office success, earning $336&amp;nbsp;million, in spite of the controversy over the characters and plot</span>
