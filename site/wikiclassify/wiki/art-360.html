				<span class='text'>The perennial core has been the Sahihayn</span>
				<span class='text'>Beyond these two foundational classics, some fourth/tenth-century scholars refer to a four-book selection that adds the two Sunans of Abu Dawud (d</span>

				<span class='text'>303/915)</span>
				<span class='text'>The Five Book canon, which is first noted in the sixth/twelfth century, incorporates the Jami' of al-Tirmidhi (d</span>

				<span class='text'>Finally the Six Book canon, which hails from the same period, adds either the Sunan of Ibn Majah (d</span>
				<span class='text'>273/887), the Sunan of al-Daraqutni (d</span>
				<span class='text'>385/995) or the Muwatta' of Malik b</span>
				<span class='text'>Anas (d</span>
				<span class='text'>179/796)</span>
				<span class='text'>Later hadith compendia often included other collections as well</span>
				<span class='text'> None of these books, however, has enjoyed the esteem of al-Bukhari's and Muslim's works</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;Some Western academics cautiously view the hadith collections as accurate historical sources</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis 1993, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>33–34&quot;/&gt; Scholars such as [[Wilferd Madelung|Madelung]] do not reject the narrations which have been compiled in later periods, but judge them in the context of history and on the basis of their compatibility with the events and figures</span>

				<span class='text'>Voltaire had both a positive and negative opinion on Muhammad: in his play ''[[Mahomet (play)|Le fanatisme, ou Mahomet le Prophète]]''  he vilifies the Prophet as a symbol of fanaticism, and in a published essay in 1748 he calls him &quot;a sublime and hearty charlatan&quot;, but in his historical survey ''Essai sur les mœurs'' , he presents Muhammad as legislator and a conqueror and calls him an &quot;enthusiast&quot;, not an imposter</span>

				<span class='text'>He rejects the common view that the Prophet is an impostor and argues that the Quran proffers &quot;the most sublime truths of cult and morals&quot;; it defines the unity of God with an &quot;admirable concision</span>
