				<span class='text'>A GCHQ mathematician said at the time that the fact that the contents had been restricted for some 70 years demonstrated their importance</span>
				<span class='text'>Turing had something of a reputation for eccentricity at Bletchley Park</span>

				<span class='text'>name MahonP14    That same night he also conceived of the idea of  a sequential statistical technique what  later called  to assist in breaking naval Enigma though I was not sure that it would work in practice and was not in fact sure until some days had actually broken</span>

				<span class='text'>After admitting his homosexuality to his fiancée who was reportedly unfazed by the revelation Turing decided that he could not go through with the marriage</span>
				<span class='text'>Turing travelled to the United States in November 1942  and worked with US Navy cryptanalysts on naval Enigma and bombe construction in Washington he also visited their  in Dayton Ohio</span>
				<span class='text'>His reaction to the American bombe design was far from enthusiasticDuring this trip he also assisted at  with the development of  devices</span>

				<span class='text'>This was a   codenamed Tunny at Bletchley Park</span>

				<span class='text'> He also introduced the Tunny team to  who under the guidance of  went on to build the  the worlds first programmable digital electronic computer which replaced a simpler prior machine the  and whose superior speed allowed the statistical decryption techniques to be applied usefully to the messages</span>
				<span class='text'> Some have mistakenly said that Turing was a key figure in the design of the Colossus computer</span>
				<span class='text'>Turingery and the statistical approach of Banburismus undoubtedly fed into the thinking about    but he was not directly involved in the Colossus development</span>
				<span class='text'>Following his work at Bell Labs in the US  Turing pursued the idea of electronic enciphering of speech in the telephone system and in the latter part of the war he moved to work for the Secret Services Radio Security Service later  at </span>
				<span class='text'>There he further developed his knowledge of electronics with the assistance of engineer Donald Bayley</span>
				<span class='text'>Together they undertook the design and construction of a portable  communications machine codenamed Delilah</span>
				<span class='text'> It was intended for different applications lacking capability for use with long distance radio transmissions and in any case Delilah was completed too late to be used during the war</span>
				<span class='text'>Though the system worked fully with Turing demonstrating it to officials by encrypting and decrypting a recording of a  speech Delilah was not adopted for use</span>
