				<span class='text'>In 1926, at the age of 13, he went on to [[Sherborne School]], an independent school in the [[market town]] of [[Sherborne]] in Dorset</span>
				<span class='text'>The first day of term coincided with the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|1926 General Strike]] in Britain, but he was so determined to attend that he rode his bicycle unaccompanied more than {{convert|60|mi|km}} from [[Southampton]] to Sherborne, stopping overnight at an inn</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1928, aged 16, Turing encountered [[Albert Einstein]]'s work; not only did he grasp it, but it is possible that he managed to deduce Einstein's questioning of [[Newton's laws of motion]] from a text in which this was never made explicit</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;At Sherborne, Turing formed a significant friendship with fellow pupil Christopher Morcom, who has been described as Turing's &quot;first love&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>He coped with his grief by working that much harder on the topics of science and mathematics that he had shared with Morcom</span>

				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt; but this seems unlikely</span>
				<span class='text'>Apparently, at this point in his life he still believed in such concepts as a spirit, independent of the body and surviving death</span>
				<span class='text'>In a later letter, also written to Morcom's mother, Turing said: &lt;blockquote&gt;Personally, I believe that spirit is really eternally connected with matter but certainly not by the same kind of body&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>as regards the actual connection between spirit and body I consider that the body [can] hold on to a 'spirit', whilst the body is alive and awake the two are firmly connected</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|pp=88,94}}&lt;/ref&gt;In 1928, German mathematician [[David Hilbert]] had called attention to the ''[[Entscheidungsproblem]]'' (decision problem)</span>
				<span class='text'>In his paper &quot;On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the ''Entscheidungsproblem''&quot; (submitted on 28 May 1936 and delivered 12 November),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1937}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turing reformulated [[Kurt Gödel]]'s 1931 results on the limits of proof and computation, replacing Gödel's universal arithmetic-based formal language with the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known as [[Turing machine]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>He proved that some such machine would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable as an [[algorithm]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He went on to prove that there was no solution to the ''[[Entscheidungsproblem]]'' by first showing that the [[halting problem]] for Turing machines is [[Decision problem|undecidable]]: in general, it is not possible to decide algorithmically whether a given Turing machine will ever halt</span>
