				<span class='text'>-&gt;'''Alexander Hamilton''' (January 11, 1755 or 1757{{spaced ndash}}July 12, 1804) was a [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Father of the United States]], chief [[Aide-de-camp|staff aide]] to General [[George Washington]], one of the most influential interpreters and promoters of the [[U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Constitution]], the founder of the nation's financial system, the founder of the [[Federalist Party]], the world's first voter-based political party, the Father of the [[United States Coast Guard]], and the founder of ''[[The New York Post]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>As the first [[Secretary of the Treasury]], Hamilton was the primary author of the economic policies of the [[Presidency of George Washington|George Washington administration]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Hamilton took the lead in the funding of the states' debts by the Federal government, the [[First Bank of the United States|establishment of a national bank]], a system of tariffs, and friendly trade relations with Britain</span>
				<span class='text'>He led the Federalist Party, created largely in support of his views; he was opposed by the [[Democratic-Republican Party]], led by [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Madison]], which despised Britain and feared that Hamilton's policies of a strong central government would weaken the American commitment to [[Republicanism in the United States|Republicanism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>orn out of wedlock, raised in the [[West Indies]], and orphaned as a child, Hamilton pursued a college education through the help of local wealthy men</span>
				<span class='text'>Recognized for his abilities and talent, he was sent to King's College (now [[Columbia University]]), in New York City</span>
				<span class='text'>Hamilton played a major role in the [[American Revolutionary War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>At the start of the war in 1775, he joined a militia company</span>
				<span class='text'>In early 1776, he raised a provincial artillery company, to which he was appointed captain</span>
				<span class='text'>He soon became the senior aide to General Washington, the American forces' commander-in-chief</span>
				<span class='text'>Washington sent him on numerous important missions to tell generals what Washington wanted</span>
				<span class='text'>After the war, Hamilton was elected to the [[Congress of the Confederation]] from New York</span>
				<span class='text'>He resigned, to practice law, and founded the [[Bank of New York]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Hamilton was among those dissatisfied with the weak national government</span>
				<span class='text'>He led the [[Annapolis Convention (1786)|Annapolis Convention]], which successfully influenced Congress to issue a call for the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Philadelphia Convention]], in order to create a new constitution</span>
				<span class='text'>He was an active participant at [[Philadelphia]]; and he helped achieve ratification by writing 51 of the 85 installments of [[The Federalist Papers|''The Federalist'' Papers]], which to this day are the single most important reference for [[Constitutional interpretation]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ira C</span>
				<span class='text'>Lupu, &quot;The Most-Cited Federalist Papers,&quot; ''Constitutional Commentary'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;Hamilton became the leading cabinet member in the new government under President Washington</span>
				<span class='text'>Hamilton was a nationalist, who emphasized strong central government and successfully argued that the [[implied powers]] of the Constitution provided the legal authority to fund the [[national debt]], assume states' debts, and create the government-owned [[First Bank of the United States|Bank of the United States]]</span>
				<span class='text'>These programs were funded primarily by [[tariff in American history|a tariff on imports]], and later also by a highly controversial tax on [[whiskey tax|whiskey]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Facing well-organized opposition from Jefferson and Madison, Hamilton mobilized a nationwide network of friends of the government, especially bankers and businessmen</span>
				<span class='text'>It became the Federalist Party</span>
				<span class='text'>A major issue splitting the parties was the [[Jay Treaty]], largely designed by Hamilton in 1794</span>
				<span class='text'>It established friendly economic relations with Britain to the chagrin of [[France]] and the supporters of the French Revolution</span>
				<span class='text'>Hamilton played a central role in the Federalist party, which dominated national and state politics until it lost the election of 1800 to Jefferson's Democratic Republicans</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1795, he returned to the practice of law in New York</span>
				<span class='text'>He tried to control the policies of [[John Adams|President Adams]] (1797–1801)</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1798 and 99, Hamilton called for mobilization against [[French First Republic|France]] after the [[XYZ Affair]] and became [[Commanding General of the United States Army|commander of a new army]], which he readied for war</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the [[Quasi-War]], while hard-fought at sea, was never officially declared and did not involve army action</span>
				<span class='text'>In the end, Adams found a diplomatic solution which avoided a war with France</span>
				<span class='text'>Hamilton's opposition to Adams' re-election helped cause his defeat in the 1800 election</span>
				<span class='text'>When Jefferson and [[Aaron Burr]] tied for the presidency in the [[electoral college]] in 1801, Hamilton helped to defeat Burr, whom he found unprincipled, and to elect Jefferson despite philosophical differences</span>
				<span class='text'>Hamilton continued his legal and business activities in New York City, but lost much of his national prominence within the Federalist party</span>
				<span class='text'>When Vice President Burr ran for governor of New York state in 1804, Hamilton crusaded against him as unworthy</span>
				<span class='text'>Taking offense at some of Hamilton's comments, Burr [[Burr–Hamilton duel|challenged him to a duel]] in 1804 and mortally wounded Hamilton, who died the next day</span>

				<span class='text'>Hamilton was born [[Out-of-wedlock|out of wedlock]] to Rachel Faucette, a married woman of partial French [[Huguenot]] descent, and James A</span>
				<span class='text'>Hamilton, the fourth son of the Scottish [[laird]] Alexander Hamilton of [[Kerelaw Castle|Grange]], [[Ayrshire]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;His mother moved with the young Hamilton to [[Saint Croix, US Virgin Islands|St</span>
				<span class='text'>Croix]] in the Virgin Islands, then ruled by [[Denmark]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It is not certain whether the year of Hamilton's birth was 1757 or 1755; most historical evidence after Hamilton's arrival in North America supports the idea that he was born in 1757, and many historians had accepted this birth date</span>
				<span class='text'>But, Hamilton's early life in the [[Caribbean]] was recorded in documents which were first published in [[Danish language|Danish]] in 1930; this evidence has caused historians since then to favor a birth year of 1755</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=c17&gt;Chernow, p</span>
				<span class='text'>17</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton listed his birth year as 1757 when he first arrived in the [[Thirteen Colonies]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He celebrated his birthday on January 11</span>
				<span class='text'>In later life, he tended to give his age only in round figures</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Probate]] papers from St</span>
				<span class='text'>Croix in 1768, after the death of Hamilton's mother, list him as then 13 years old, a date that would support a birth year of 1755</span>
				<span class='text'>Historians have posited reasons for the different dates of birth being used: If 1755 is correct, Hamilton may have been trying to appear younger than his college classmates or perhaps wished to avoid standing out as older; if 1757 is correct, the probate document indicating a birth year of 1755 may have been in error, or Hamilton may have been attempting to pass as 13, in order to be more employable after his mother's death</span>

				<span class='text'>Because Alexander Hamilton's parents were not legally married, the [[Church of England]] denied him membership and education in the church school</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;James Hamilton abandoned Rachel and their sons, allegedly to &quot;spar[e] [Rachel] a charge of bigamy </span>

				<span class='text'>after finding out that her first husband intend[ed] to divorce her under Danish law on grounds of adultery and desertion</span>

				<span class='text'>Croix, keeping a small store in [[Christiansted]]</span>
				<span class='text'>She contracted a severe fever and died on February 19, 1768, 1:02&amp;nbsp;am, leaving Hamilton orphaned</span>
				<span class='text'>This may have had severe emotional consequences for him, even by the standards of an 18th-century childhood</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In [[probate court]], Rachel's &quot;first husband seized her estate&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Randall1&quot;/&gt; and obtained the few valuables Rachel had owned, including some household silver</span>
				<span class='text'>Many items were [[auction]]ed off, but a friend purchased the family's books and returned them to the young Hamilton</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Chernow, p</span>
				<span class='text'>25</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Hamilton became a clerk at a local import-export firm, Beekman and Cruger, which traded with [[New England]]; he was left in charge of the firm for five months in 1771, while the owner was at sea</span>
				<span class='text'>He and his older brother James Jr</span>
				<span class='text'>were adopted briefly by a cousin, Peter Lytton; but when Lytton committed suicide, the brothers were separated</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Chernow, p</span>
				<span class='text'>26</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  James apprenticed with a local carpenter, while Alexander was adopted by a Nevis merchant, Thomas Stevens</span>
				<span class='text'>According to the writer [[Ron Chernow]], some evidence suggests that Stevens may have been Alexander Hamilton's biological father; his son, Edward Stevens, became a close friend of Hamilton</span>
				<span class='text'>The two boys were described as looking much alike, were both fluent in French, and shared similar interests</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Chernow, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>27–30</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Hamilton continued clerking, but he remained an avid reader, later developing an interest in writing, and began to desire a life outside the small island where he lived</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote an essay published in the ''Royal Danish-American Gazette'', a detailed account of a hurricane which had devastated Christiansted on August 30, 1772</span>
				<span class='text'> His biographer says that, &quot;Hamilton's famous letter about the storm astounds the reader for two reasons: for all its bombastic excesses, it does seem wondrous the 17-year-old self-educated clerk could write with such verve and gusto</span>
				<span class='text'>Clearly, Hamilton was highly literate and already had considerable fund of verbal riches</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Chernow, p</span>
				<span class='text'>37&lt;/ref&gt; The essay impressed community leaders, who collected a fund to send the young Hamilton to the North American colonies for his education</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;While on Washington's staff, Hamilton long sought command and a return to active combat</span>
				<span class='text'>As the war drew nearer to an end, he knew that opportunities for military glory were diminishing</span>
				<span class='text'>In February 1781, Hamilton was mildly reprimanded by Washington and used this as an excuse to resign his staff position</span>
				<span class='text'>He asked Washington and others for a field command</span>
				<span class='text'>This continued until early July 1781, when Hamilton submitted a letter to Washington with his [[Officer (armed forces)|commission]] enclosed, &quot;thus tacitly threatening to resign if he didn't get his desired command</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Chernow, p</span>
				<span class='text'>159</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;On July 31, 1781, Washington relented and assigned Hamilton as commander of a New York [[light infantry]] battalion</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Murray, p</span>
				<span class='text'>69</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In the planning for the assault on [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]], Hamilton was given command of three [[battalion]]s, which were to fight in conjunction with the allied [[French Army|French troops]] in taking [[Redoubt]]s No</span>

				<span class='text'>10 of the British fortifications at Yorktown</span>
				<span class='text'>Hamilton and his battalions fought bravely and took Redoubt No</span>

				<span class='text'>The French also fought bravely, suffered heavy casualties, and took Redoubt No</span>

				<span class='text'>These actions forced the [[British Army|British]] surrender of an entire army at [[Yorktown, Virginia]], effectively ending their major [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] military operations in North America</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Congress of the Confederation===After the Battle of Yorktown, Hamilton resigned his commission</span>
				<span class='text'>He was appointed in July 1782 to the [[Congress of the Confederation]] as a New York representative for the term beginning in November 1782</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Syrett, p</span>
				<span class='text'>III:117; for a one-year term beginning the &quot;first Monday in November next&quot;, arrived in Philadelphia between the November 18 and 25, and resigned July 1783</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Before his appointment to Congress in 1782, Hamilton was already sharing his criticisms of Congress</span>
				<span class='text'> He expressed these criticisms in his letter to James Duane dated September 3, 1780</span>
				<span class='text'> In this letter he wrote, &quot;The fundamental defect is a want of power in Congress…the confederation itself is defective and requires to be altered; it is neither fit for war, nor peace</span>

				<span class='text'>70–71&lt;/ref&gt; While on Washington's staff, Hamilton had become frustrated with the decentralized nature of the wartime Continental Congress, particularly its dependence upon the states for voluntary financial support</span>
				<span class='text'>Under the Articles of Confederation, Congress had no power to collect taxes or to demand money from the states</span>
				<span class='text'>This lack of a stable source of funding had made it difficult for the Continental Army both to obtain its necessary provisions and to pay its soldiers</span>
				<span class='text'>During the war, and for some time after, Congress obtained what funds it could from subsidies from the King of France, from aid requested from the several states (which were often unable or unwilling to contribute), and from European loans</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kohn; Brant, p</span>
				<span class='text'>45; Rakove, p</span>
				<span class='text'>324</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;An amendment to the Articles had been proposed by [[Thomas Burke (North Carolina)|Thomas Burke]], in February 1781, to give Congress the power to collect a 5% impost, or duty on all imports, but this required ratification by all states; securing its passage as law proved impossible after it was rejected by Rhode Island in November 1782</span>
				<span class='text'>Madison joined Hamilton in persuading Congress to send a delegation to persuade Rhode Island to change its mind</span>
				<span class='text'>Their report recommending the delegation argued the federal government needed not just some level of financial autonomy, but also the ability to make laws that superseded those of the individual states</span>
				<span class='text'>Hamilton transmitted a letter arguing that Congress already had the power to tax, since it had the power to fix the sums due from the several states; but Virginia's [[rescission]] of its own ratification ended the Rhode Island negotiations</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Brant, p</span>
				<span class='text'>100; Chernow, p</span>
				<span class='text'>176</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Congress and the army===While Hamilton was in Congress, discontented soldiers began to pose a danger to the young United States</span>
				<span class='text'>Most of the army was then posted at [[Newburgh, New York|Newburgh]], New York</span>
				<span class='text'>Those in the army were paying for much of their own supplies, and they had not been paid in eight months</span>
				<span class='text'>Furthermore, the Continental officers had been promised, in May 1778, after [[Valley Forge]], a pension of half their pay when they were discharged</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Martin and Lender, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>109, 160: at first for seven years, increased to life after Arnold's treason</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1780s, due to the structure of the government under the Articles of Confederation, it had no power to tax to either raise revenue or pay its soldiers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Tucker15&gt;Tucker, p</span>
				<span class='text'>470</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In 1782 after several months without pay, a group of officers organized to send a delegation to lobby Congress, led by Capt</span>
				<span class='text'>Alexander MacDougall</span>
				<span class='text'>The officers had three demands: the Army's pay, their own pensions, and commutation of those pensions into a lump-sum payment if Congress were unable to afford the half-salary pensions for life</span>
				<span class='text'>Congress rejected the proposal</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Tucker15/&gt;Several Congressmen, including Hamilton, [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] and [[Gouverneur Morris]], attempted to use this [[Newburgh Conspiracy]] as leverage to secure support from the states and in Congress for funding of the national government</span>
				<span class='text'>They encouraged MacDougall to continue his aggressive approach, threatening unknown consequences if their demands were not met, and defeated proposals that would have resolved the crisis without establishing general federal taxation: that the states assume the debt to the army, or that an [[Tax#Tariff|impost]] be established dedicated to the sole purpose of paying that debt</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=ellis141&gt;Kohn; Ellis 2004, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>141–4</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton suggested using the Army's claims to prevail upon the states for the proposed national funding system</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kohn, p</span>
				<span class='text'>196</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The Morrises and Hamilton contacted Knox to suggest he and the officers defy civil authority, at least by not disbanding if the army were not satisfied; Hamilton wrote Washington to suggest that Hamilton covertly &quot;take direction&quot; of the officers' efforts to secure redress, to secure continental funding but keep the army within the limits of moderation</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;On March 15, Washington defused the Newburgh situation by giving a speech to the officers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ellis141&quot;/&gt; Congress ordered the Army officially disbanded in April 1783</span>
				<span class='text'>In the same month, Congress passed a new measure for a twenty-five-year impost—which Hamilton voted against&lt;ref&gt;Rakove, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>322, 325</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;—that again required the consent of all the states; it also approved a commutation of the officers' pensions to five years of full pay</span>
				<span class='text'>Rhode Island again opposed these provisions, and Hamilton's robust assertions of national prerogatives in his previous letter were widely held to be excessive</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Brant, p</span>
				<span class='text'>108</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In June 1783, a different group of disgruntled soldiers from Lancaster, Pennsylvania, sent Congress a petition demanding their back pay</span>
				<span class='text'>When they began to march toward Philadelphia, Congress charged Hamilton and two others with intercepting the mob</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Chernow, p</span>
				<span class='text'>180</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton requested militia from Pennsylvania's Supreme Executive Council, but was turned down</span>
				<span class='text'>Hamilton instructed Assistant Secretary of War William Jackson to intercept the men</span>
				<span class='text'>Jackson was unsuccessful</span>
				<span class='text'>The mob arrived in Philadelphia, and the soldiers proceeded to harangue Congress for their pay</span>
				<span class='text'>The President of Congress, John Dickinson, feared that the Pennsylvania state militia was unreliable, and refused its help</span>
				<span class='text'>Hamilton argued that Congress ought to adjourn to Princeton, New Jersey</span>
				<span class='text'>Congress agreed, and relocated there</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Chernow, p</span>
				<span class='text'>182</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Frustrated with the weakness of the central government, Hamilton while in Princeton drafted a call to revise the Articles of Confederation</span>
				<span class='text'>This resolution contained many features of the future US Constitution, including a strong federal government with the ability to collect taxes and raise an army</span>
				<span class='text'>It also included the separation of powers into the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Chernow, p</span>
				<span class='text'>183</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Return to New York===Hamilton resigned from Congress, and in July 1783 was authorized to practice law in New York after several months of self-directed education</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Chernow, p</span>
				<span class='text'>160</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He practiced law in New York City in partnership with [[Richard Harison]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He specialized in defending Tories and British subjects, as in ''[[Rutgers v</span>
				<span class='text'>Waddington]]'', in which he defeated a claim for damages done to a brewery by the Englishmen who held it during the military occupation of New York</span>
				<span class='text'>He pleaded for the Mayor's Court to interpret state law consistent with the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|1783 Treaty of Paris]] which had ended the Revolutionary War</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In 1784, he founded the [[Bank of New York]], now the oldest ongoing bank in the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>Hamilton was one of the men who restored King's College, which had been suspended since 1776 and severely damaged during the War, as [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia College]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Long dissatisfied with the weak Articles of Confederation, he played a major leadership role at the [[Annapolis Convention (1786)|Annapolis Convention]] in 1786</span>
				<span class='text'>He drafted its resolution for a constitutional convention, and in doing so brought his longtime desire to have a more powerful, more financially independent federal government one step closer to reality</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|Hamilton shortly after the [[American Revolution]]]]===Constitutional Convention and ratification of the Constitution===In 1787, Hamilton served as assemblyman from [[New York County]] in the [[New York State Legislature]] and was chosen as a delegate for the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] by his father-in-law Philip Schuyler</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Schachner, p</span>
				<span class='text'>191</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morton, p</span>
				<span class='text'>169</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Even though Hamilton had been a leader in calling for a new Constitutional Convention, his direct influence at the Convention itself was quite limited</span>
				<span class='text'>Governor [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]]'s faction in the New York legislature had chosen New York's other two delegates, [[John Lansing, Jr</span>
				<span class='text'>] and [[Robert Yates (politician)|Robert Yates]], and both of them opposed Hamilton's goal of a strong national government</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Chernow, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>227–28</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Morton15&gt;Morton, p</span>
				<span class='text'>131</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Thus, whenever the other two members of the New York delegation were present, they decided New York's vote, to ensure that there was no major alterations to the Articles of Confederation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Schachner, p</span>
				<span class='text'>195</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Early in the Convention he made a speech proposing a President-for-Life; it had no effect upon the deliberations of the convention</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Philadelphia Convention#Hamilton's Plan|He proposed]] to have an elected President and elected [[United States Senate|Senators]] who would serve for life, contingent upon &quot;good behavior&quot; and subject to removal for corruption or abuse; this idea contributed later to the hostile view of Hamilton as a monarchist sympathizer, held by [[James Madison]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Chernow, p</span>
				<span class='text'>232</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; According to Madison's notes, Hamilton said in regards to the executive, &quot;The English model was the only good one on this subject</span>
				<span class='text'>The hereditary interest of the king was so interwoven with that of the nation, and his personal emoluments so great, that he was placed above the danger of being corrupted from abroad…Let one executive be appointed for life who dares execute his powers</span>

				<span class='text'>Larson and Michael P</span>
				<span class='text'>Winship</span>
				<span class='text'>New York: Modern Library, 2005</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton argued, &quot;And let me observe that an executive is less dangerous to the liberties of the people when in office during life than for seven years</span>
				<span class='text'> It may be said this constitutes as an elective monarchy…But by making the executive subject to impeachment, the term 'monarchy' cannot apply…&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Madison, p</span>
				<span class='text'>51&lt;/ref&gt;  During the convention, Hamilton constructed a draft for the Constitution based on the convention debates, but he never presented it</span>
				<span class='text'>This draft had most of the features of the actual Constitution</span>
				<span class='text'>In this draft, the Senate was to be elected in proportion to the population, being two-fifths the size of the House, and the President and Senators were to be elected through complex multistage elections, in which chosen electors would elect smaller bodies of electors; they would hold office for life, but were removable for misconduct</span>
				<span class='text'>The President would have an absolute veto</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] was to have immediate jurisdiction over all [[law suits]] involving the United States, and state governors were to be appointed by the federal government</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>I:397 ff</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;At the end of the Convention, Hamilton was still not content with the final form of the Constitution, but signed it anyway as a vast improvement over the Articles of Confederation, and urged his fellow delegates to do so also</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Brant, p</span>
				<span class='text'>195</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Since the other two members of the New York delegation, Lansing and Yates, had already withdrawn, Hamilton was the only New York signer to the United States Constitution</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Schachner, p</span>
				<span class='text'>206</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He then took a highly active part in the successful campaign for the document's ratification in New York in 1788, which was a crucial step in its national ratification</span>
				<span class='text'>He first used the popularity of the Constitution by the masses to compel George Clinton to sign, but was unsuccessful</span>
				<span class='text'>The state convention in Poughkeepsie in June 1788 pitted Hamilton, Jay, [[James Duane]], [[Robert Le Roy Livingston|Robert Livingston]], and [[Richard Morris (U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>politician)|Richard Morris]] against the Clintonian faction led by [[Melancton Smith]], Lansing, Yates, and [[Gilbert Livingston]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Denboer15&gt;Denboer, p</span>
				<span class='text'>196</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton's faction were against any conditional ratification, under the impression that New York would not be accepted into the Union, while Clinton's faction wanted to amend the Constitution, while maintaining the state's right to secede if their attempts failed</span>
				<span class='text'>During the state convention, New Hampshire and Virginia becoming the ninth and tenth states to ratify the Constitution, respectively, had ensured any adjournment would not happen and a compromise would have to be reached</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Denboer15/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kaplan15&gt;Kaplan, p</span>
				<span class='text'>75</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton's arguments used for the ratifications were largely iterations of work from ''The Federalist'' Papers, and Smith eventually went for ratification, though it was more out of necessity than Hamilton's rhetoric</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Kaplan15/&gt; The vote in the state constitution was ratified 30 to 27, on 26 July 1788</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Denboer, p</span>
				<span class='text'>197</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In 1788, Hamilton served yet another term in what proved to be the last session of the [[Continental Congress]] under the [[Articles of Confederation]]</span>
				<span class='text'>When the term of Philip Schuyler was up in 1791, elected in his place was the attorney general of New York, one [[Aaron Burr]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Hamilton blamed Burr for this result, and ill characterizations of Burr appear in his correspondence thereafter</span>
				<span class='text'>The two men did work together from time to time thereafter on various projects, including Hamilton's army of 1798 and the [[Manhattan Water Company]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lomask, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>139–40, 216–17, 220</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===''The Federalist'' Papers===Hamilton recruited John Jay and James Madison to write a series of essays defending the proposed Constitution, now known as [[The Federalist Papers|''The Federalist'' Papers]], and made the largest contribution to that effort, writing 51 of 85 essays published (Madison wrote 29, Jay only five)</span>
				<span class='text'>Hamilton supervised the entire project, enlisted the participants, wrote the majority of the essays, and oversaw the publication</span>
				<span class='text'>During the project each person was responsible for their areas of expertise; Jay covered foreign relations, Madison covered the history of republics and confederacies, along with the anatomy of the new government and Hamilton covered the branches of government most pertinent to him: the executive and judicial branches, with some aspects of the Senate, as well as covering military matters and taxation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Chernow, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>247–48</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The papers first appeared in ''[[The Independent Journal]]'' in October 27, 1787</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Chernow, p</span>
				<span class='text'>247</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Hamilton wrote the first paper signed as Publius, and all of the subsequent papers were signed under the name</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Schachner, p</span>
				<span class='text'>210</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Jay wrote the next four papers to elaborate on the confederation's weakness and the need for unity against foreign aggression and against splitting into rival confederacies, and, except for Number 64, was not further involved</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Chernow, p</span>
				<span class='text'>253</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schachner, p</span>
				<span class='text'>211</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton's highlights included discussion that although republics have been culpable for disorders in the past, advances in the &quot;science of politics&quot; had fostered principles that ensured that those abuses could be prevented, such as the division of powers, legislative checks and balances, an independent judiciary, and legislators that were represented by electors (Numbers 7–9)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Chernow, p</span>
				<span class='text'>254</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton also wrote an extensive defense of the constitution (No</span>
				<span class='text'>23–36), and discussed the Senate and executive and judicial branches in Numbers 65–85</span>
				<span class='text'>Hamilton and Madison worked to describe the anarchic state of the confederation in numbers 15–22, and have been described as not being entirely different in thought during this time period in contrast to their stark opposition later in life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Chernow, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>252–55</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Subtle differences appeared with the two when discussing the necessity of standing armies</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Chernow, p</span>
				<span class='text'>257&lt;/ref&gt;==Reconciliation between New York and Vermont==In 1764 King George III had ruled in favor of New York in a dispute between New York and New Hampshire over the region that later became the state of [[Vermont]]</span>
				<span class='text'> New York refused to recognize claims to property derived from grants by New Hampshire governor [[Benning Wentworth]] during the preceding 15 years when the territory had been governed as a de facto part of New Hampshire</span>
				<span class='text'> Consequently, the people of the disputed territory, called the [[New Hampshire Grants]], resisted the enforcement of New York's laws within the Grants</span>
				<span class='text'> Indeed, [[Ethan Allen]]'s militia called the [[Green Mountain Boys]], noted for successes in the war against the British in 1775, was originally formed for the purpose of resisting the colonial government of New York</span>
				<span class='text'> In 1777 the statesmen of the Grants declared it a [[Vermont Republic|separate state to be called Vermont]], and by early 1778 had erected a state government</span>
				<span class='text'> During 1777–1785, Vermont was repeatedly denied representation in the Continental Congress, largely because New York insisted that Vermont was legally a part of New York</span>
				<span class='text'> Vermont took the position that because the denial its petitions for [[admission to the Union]], it was not a part of the United States, not subject to Congress, and at liberty to negotiate separately with the British</span>
				<span class='text'> The latter [[Haldimand negotiations]] led to some exchanges of prisoners of war</span>
				<span class='text'> The peace treaty of 1783 that ended the war included Vermont within the boundaries of the United States</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  As a member of the legislature of New York, Hamilton argued forcefully and at length in favor of a bill to recognize the sovereignty of the State of Vermont, against numerous objections to its constitutionality and policy</span>
				<span class='text'> Consideration of the bill was deferred to a later date</span>
				<span class='text'> In 1788 and 1789 extensive negotiations were carried out between Hamilton and [[Nathaniel Chipman]], a lawyer representing Vermont</span>
				<span class='text'> Among the topics were the location of the border between Vermont and New York, and financial compensation of New York land-grantees whose grants Vermont refused to recognize because they conflicted with earlier grants from New Hampshire</span>
				<span class='text'> In 1788 the new Constitution of the United States went into effect, with its plan to replace the unicameral Continental Congress with a new Congress consisting of a Senate and a House of Representatives</span>
				<span class='text'> Hamilton wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;One of the first subjects of deliberation with the new Congress will be the independence of Kentucky [at that time still a part of Virginia], for which the southern states will be anxious</span>
				<span class='text'> The northern will be glad to find a counterpoise in Vermont</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/blockquote&gt;In 1790 the legislature of New York agreed to give up that state's claim to jurisdiction in Vermont on condition that Congress would admit Vermont state to the Union</span>

				<span class='text'>93&lt;/ref&gt;===Report on Public Credit===Before the adjournment of the House in September 1789, they requested Hamilton to make a report on suggestions to improve the public credit by January 1790</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Murray121&gt;Murray, p</span>
				<span class='text'>121</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton had written to Robert Morris as early as 1781 that fixing the public credit will win their objective of independence</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Murray121/&gt; The sources that Hamilton used ranged from Frenchmen such as Jacques Necker and Montesquieu to British writers such as [[David Hume|Hume]], [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]], and [[Malachy Postlethwayt]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Chernow121&gt;Chernow, p</span>
				<span class='text'>296</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; While writing the report he also sought out suggestions from contemporaries such as [[John Witherspoon|John Knox Witherspoon]], and Madison</span>
				<span class='text'>Although they agreed on additional taxes such as distilleries and duties on imported liquors and land taxes, Madison feared that the securities from the government debt would fall in foreign hands</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Chernow121/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schachner, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>244–45</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In the report, Hamilton felt that the debt that the United States had accrued during the Revolutionary War was the price it paid for its liberty</span>
				<span class='text'>He argued that liberty and property security were inseparable and that the government should honor the contracts, as they formed the basis of public and private morality</span>
				<span class='text'>To Hamilton, the proper handling of the government debt would also allow America to borrow at affordable interest rates and would also be a stimulant to the economy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Chernow, p</span>
				<span class='text'>297</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton divided the debt into national and state, and further divided the national debt into foreign and domestic debt</span>
				<span class='text'>While there was agreement on how to handle the foreign debt (especially with France), there was not with regards to the national debt held by domestic creditors</span>
				<span class='text'>During the Revolutionary War, affluent citizens had invested in bonds, and war veterans had been paid with [[promissory notes]] and [[IOU]]s that plummeted in price during the Confederation</span>
				<span class='text'>In response, the war veterans sold the securities to speculators for as little as fifteen to twenty cents on the dollar</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Murray, p</span>
				<span class='text'>124</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chernow, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>297–98</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton felt the money from the bonds should not go to the soldiers, but the speculators that had bought the bonds from the soldiers, as they had little faith in the country's future</span>
				<span class='text'>The process of attempting to track down the original bond holders along with the government showing discrimination among the classes of holders if the war veterans were to be compensated also weighed in as factors for Hamilton</span>
				<span class='text'>As for the state debts, Hamilton suggested to consolidate it with the national debt and label it as federal debt, for the sake of efficiency on a national scale</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Chernow, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>298–99</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The last portion of the report dealt with eliminating the debt by utilizing a [[sinking fund]] that would retire five percent of the debt annually until it was paid off</span>
				<span class='text'>Due to the bonds being traded well below their face value, the purchases would benefit the government as the securities rose in price</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Chernow, p</span>
				<span class='text'>300</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;When the report was submitted to the House of Representatives, detractors soon began to speak against it</span>
				<span class='text'>The notion of programs that resembled British practice were wicked along with the power of balance being shifted away from the Representatives to the executive branch were some of the prejudices that resided within the House</span>
				<span class='text'>[[William Maclay (politician)|William Maclay]] suspected that that several congressmen were involved in government securities, saw Congress in an unholy league with New York speculators</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Chernow, p</span>
				<span class='text'>302</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Congressman [[James Jackson (politician)|James Jackson]] also spoke against New York with allegations of speculators attempting to swindle those who had yet heard about Hamilton's report</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Chernow, p</span>
				<span class='text'>303</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The involvement of those in Hamilton's circle such as Schuyler, William Duer, James Duane, Gouverneur Morris, and [[Rufus King]] as speculators was not favorable to those against the report, either, though Hamilton personally did not own or deal a share in the debt</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Chernow, p</span>
				<span class='text'>304</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schachner, p</span>
				<span class='text'>250</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Madison eventually spoke against it by February 1790</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he was not against current holders of government debt to profit, he wanted the windfall to go to the original holders</span>
				<span class='text'>Madison did not feel that the original holders had lost faith in the government, but sold their securities out of desperation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Chernow, p</span>
				<span class='text'>305&quot;&gt;Chernow, p</span>
				<span class='text'>305</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The compromise was seen as egregious to both Hamiltonians and their dissidents such as Maclay, and Madison's vote was defeated 36 votes to 13 on February 22</span>

				<span class='text'>305&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schachner, p</span>
				<span class='text'>255</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The fight for the national government to assume state debt was a longer issue, and lasted over four months</span>
				<span class='text'>During the period, the resources that Hamilton was to apply to the payment of state debts was requested by [[Alexander White (Virginia)|Alexander White]], and was rejected due to Hamilton's not being able to prepare information by March 3, and was even postponed by his own supporters in spite of configuring a report the next day (which consisted of a series of additional duties to meet the interest on the state debts)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Schachner, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>297–98</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Some of the other issues involving Hamilton was bypassing the rising issue of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] in Congress after [[Quaker]]s petitioned for its abolition (though he returned to the issue the following year),&lt;ref&gt;Chernow, p</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Schachner, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>258–59</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The temporary location of the capital from New York City also played a role, as [[Tench Coxe]] was sent to speak to Maclay to bargain about the capital being temporarily located to Philadelphia, as a single vote in the Senate was needed and five in the House for the bill to pass</span>

				<span class='text'>268</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Cooke82/&gt;Hamilton suggested that Congress should charter the [[First Bank of the United States|National Bank]] with a capitalization of $10 million, one-fifth of which would be handled by the Government</span>
				<span class='text'>Since the Government did not have the money, it would borrow the money from the bank itself, and repay the loan in ten even annual installments</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=McDonald194&gt;McDonald, p</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The bank was to be governed by a twenty-five member board of directors that was to represent a large majority of the private shareholders, which Hamilton considered essential for his being under a private direction</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Schachner268/&gt; Hamilton's bank model had many similarities to that of the Bank of England, except Hamilton wanted to exclude the Government from being involved in [[public debt]], but provide a large, firm, and elastic money supply for the functioning of normal businesses and usual economic development, among other differences</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McDonald, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>194–95</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; For tax revenue to ignite the bank, it was the same as he had previously proposed; increases on imported spirits: rum, liquor, and whiskey</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McDonald, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>195–96</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The bill passed through the Senate practically without a problem, but objections of the proposal increased by the time it reached the House of Representatives</span>
				<span class='text'>It was generally held by critics that Hamilton was serving the interests of the Northeast by means of the bank,&lt;ref&gt;Cooke, p</span>
				<span class='text'>90</span>

				<span class='text'>270</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Among those critics was James Jackson of Georgia, who also attempted to refute the report by quoting from ''The Federalist'' Papers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Schachner270/&gt; Madison and Jefferson also opposed the bank bill; however, the potential of the capital not being moved to the Potomac if the bank was to have a firm establishment in Philadelphia (the current capital of the United States) was a more significant reason, and actions that Pennsylvania members of Congress took to keep the capital there made both men anxious</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McDonald, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>199–200</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Madison warned the Pennsylvania congress members that he would attack the bill as unconstitutional in the House, and followed up on his threat</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McDonald, p</span>
				<span class='text'>200</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Madison argued his case of where the power of a bank could be established within the Constitution, but he failed to sway members of the House, and his authority on the constitution was questioned by a few members</span>

				<span class='text'>271–72</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In response to the objection of the 'necessary and proper' clause, Hamilton stated that &quot;Necessary often means no more than needful, requisite, incidental, useful, or conductive to&quot;, and the bank was a &quot;convenient species of medium in which they (taxes) are to be paid</span>

				<span class='text'>In response to the rebellion, believing compliance with the laws was vital to the establishment of federal authority, Hamilton accompanied to the rebellion's site President Washington, General [[Henry Lee III|Henry &quot;Light Horse Harry&quot; Lee]], and more federal troops than were ever assembled in one place during the Revolution</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McDonald, p</span>
				<span class='text'>244</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton also thought of the United States being a primarily agrarian country would be a disadvantage in dealing with Europe</span>

				<span class='text'>102</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1794 policy toward Britain became a major point of contention between the two parties</span>
				<span class='text'>Hamilton and the Federalists wished for more trade with Britain, the new nation's largest trading partner</span>
				<span class='text'> The Republicans saw Britain as the main threat to republicanism and proposed instead a trade war</span>

				<span class='text'>Reynolds appeared to Hamilton as a woman who had been abandoned by her husband, James, at New York and wished to return to there</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Schachner2015b&gt;Schachner, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>366–69</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton did not have any money on his person, so he retrieved her address in order to deliver the funds in person</span>
				<span class='text'>After the brief dialogue in Reynolds' bedroom, he had frequent meetings with her</span>
				<span class='text'>Hamilton then received two letters on December 15, 1791, one from both Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>and Mrs</span>
				<span class='text'>Reynolds</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Schachner2015b/&gt; The first letter was Maria warning of her husband's knowledge and of James attempting to [[blackmail]] Hamilton</span>
				<span class='text'>By this point Hamilton contemplated ending the tryst, and briefly ceased to visit, but both apparently were involved in the blackmailing scheme as both sent letters,&lt;ref name=&quot;Schachner2015b&quot;/&gt; and at one point James Reynolds requested to 'befriend' her</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Chernow, p</span>
				<span class='text'>370</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; By May of 1792, James Reynolds had requested for Hamilton to no longer see his wife, but not before receiving fifty and two hundred dollars out of over $1300 in blackmail</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Schachner, p</span>
				<span class='text'>369</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton possibly was aware of both Reynolds' being involved before the blackmailing incident</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Murray, p</span>
				<span class='text'>165</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;When under suspicion of illegal actions while Secretary of Treasury by associating with William Duer from [[John J</span>
				<span class='text'>Beckley]] and Jacob Clingman, the latter also had alleged evidence of James Reynolds being an agent of Hamilton's, with accompanying letters gathered from Maria Reynolds that were from Hamilton</span>
				<span class='text'>This information was relayed to [[James Monroe]], who consulted with Congressmen Muhlenberg and Venable on what actions to take</span>
				<span class='text'>When it was suggested by Clingman that James Reynolds had evidence that would incriminate Hamilton, after both were arrested for counterfeiting and Clingman was released, Monroe and the Congressmen soon confronted Hamilton on 15 December 1792</span>
				<span class='text'>After Hamilton discussed the affair, the trio were to keep the documents privately with the utmost confidence</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Schachner2015b/&gt;In 1797, however, when &quot;notoriously scurrilous journalist&quot; [[James T</span>
				<span class='text'>Callender]] published ''A History of the United States for the Year 1796'', it contained accusations of James Reynolds being an agent of Hamilton using documents from the confrontation on December 15, 1792</span>
				<span class='text'>On July 5, 1797, Hamilton wrote to all three men to confirm that there was nothing that would damage the perception of his integrity while Secretary of Treasury</span>
				<span class='text'>All complied but Monroe, and after several rounds of argument, the two almost resorted to a duel</span>
				<span class='text'>When Hamilton did not obtain an explicit response from Monroe, he published a pamphlet in order to preserve his public reputation, and discussed the affair in exquisite detail</span>
				<span class='text'>His wife forgave him, but not Monroe</span>
				<span class='text'>Though he faced ridicule from the Democratic-Republican faction, he maintained his availability for public service</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===1796 presidential election===Hamilton's resignation as Secretary of the Treasury in 1795 did not remove him from public life</span>
				<span class='text'>With the resumption of his law practice, he remained close to Washington as an advisor and friend</span>
				<span class='text'>Hamilton influenced Washington in the composition of his [[George Washington's Farewell Address|Farewell Address]] by writing drafts for Washington to compare with the latter's draft, although when Washington contemplated retirement in 1792, he had consulted James Madison for a draft that was used in a similar manner to Hamilton's</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Garrity and Spalding, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>47, 50–55</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murray, p</span>
				<span class='text'>207</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In the election of 1796, under the Constitution as it stood then, each of the presidential [[Electoral College (United States)|electors]] had two votes, which they were to cast for different men</span>
				<span class='text'>The one who received most votes would become President, the second-most, Vice President</span>
				<span class='text'>This system was not designed with the operation of parties in mind, as they had been thought disreputable and factious</span>
				<span class='text'>The Federalists planned to deal with this by having all their Electors vote for [[John Adams]], the Vice President, and all but a few for [[Thomas Pinckney]] of [[South Carolina]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Chernow117/&gt;Adams resented Hamilton's influence with Washington and considered him overambitious and scandalous in his private life; Hamilton compared Adams unfavorably with Washington and thought him too emotionally unstable to be President</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Chernow117&gt;Chernow, p</span>
				<span class='text'>510</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton took the election as an opportunity: he urged all the northern electors to vote for Adams and Pinckney, lest Jefferson get in; but he cooperated with [[Edward Rutledge]] to have South Carolina's electors vote for Jefferson and Pinckney</span>
				<span class='text'>If all this worked, Pinckney would have more votes than Adams, Pinckney would become President, and Adams would remain Vice President, but it did not work</span>
				<span class='text'>The Federalists found out about it (even the French minister to the United States knew), and northern Federalists voted for Adams but ''not'' for Pinckney, in sufficient numbers that Pinckney came in third and Jefferson became Vice President</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Elkins and McKitrick; ''Age of Federalism'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>523–28, 859</span>
				<span class='text'>Rutledge had his own plan, to have Pinckney win with Jefferson as Vice President</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Adams resented the intrigue since he felt his service to the nation was much more extensive than Pinckney's</span>

				<span class='text'>He directed them to pass a direct tax to fund the war</span>
				<span class='text'>Smith resigned in July 1797, as Hamilton scolded him for slowness, and told Wolcott to tax houses instead of land</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Newman, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>72–3</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The eventual program included a [[Stamp Act]] like that of the British before the Revolution and other taxes on land, houses, and slaves, calculated at different rates in different states, and requiring difficult and intricate assessment of houses</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, p</span>
				<span class='text'>155</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This provoked resistance in southeastern Pennsylvania, led primarily by men such as [[John Fries]] who had marched with Washington against the Whiskey Rebellion</span>

				<span class='text'>The army was to guard against invasion from France</span>
				<span class='text'>Adams, however, derailed all plans for war by opening negotiations with France</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Mitchell II:483&lt;/ref&gt; Adams had held it proper to retain the members of Washington's cabinet, except for cause; he found, in 1800 (after Washington's death), that they were obeying Hamilton rather than himself, and fired several of them</span>

				<span class='text'>392–99&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1799, the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]] had left one Democratic-Republican newspaper functioning in New York City; when the last, the ''New Daily Advertiser'', reprinted an article saying that Hamilton had attempted to purchase the Philadelphia ''Aurora'' and close it down, Hamilton had the publisher prosecuted for [[seditious libel]], and the prosecution compelled the owner to close the paper</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Aaron Burr had won New York for Jefferson in May; now Hamilton proposed a rerun of the election under different rules—with carefully drawn districts and each choosing an elector—such that the Federalists would split the electoral vote of New York</span>
				<span class='text'>{refn|The May 1800 election chose the New York legislature, which would in turn choose electors; Burr had won this by making it a referendum on the presidency, and by persuading better-qualified candidates to run, who declared their candidacy only after the Federalists had announced their ticket</span>
				<span class='text'>Hamilton asked Jay and the lame-duck legislature to pass a law declaring a special federal election, in which each district would choose an elector</span>
				<span class='text'>He also supplied a map, with as many Federalist districts as possible</span>
				<span class='text'>group=&quot;note&quot;}} (John Jay, a Federalist who had given up the Supreme Court to be Governor of New York, wrote on the back of the letter the words, &quot;Proposing a measure for party purposes which it would not become me to adopt,&quot; and declined to reply</span>

				<span class='text'>419–21</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;John Adams was running this time with [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney]] of South Carolina (the elder brother of candidate Thomas Pinckney from the 1796 election)</span>
				<span class='text'>Hamilton now toured [[New England]], again urging northern electors to hold firm for a Pinckney in the renewed hope of making a Pinckney president; and he again intrigued in South Carolina</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=McDonald2015&gt;McDonald, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>350–51</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton's ideas involved coaxing middle-state Federalists to assert their non-support for Adams if there was no support for Pinckney and writing to more of the modest supports of Adams concerning his supposed misconduct while president</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=McDonald2015/&gt; Hamilton expected to see southern states such as the Carolinas cast their votes for Pinckney and Jefferson, and would result in the former being ahead of both Adams and Jefferson</span>

				<span class='text'>394–95</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In accordance with the second of the aforementioned plans, and a recent personal rift with Adams,&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, p</span>
				<span class='text'>351</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton wrote a pamphlet called ''Letter from Alexander Hamilton, Concerning the Public Conduct and Character of John Adams, Esq</span>
				<span class='text'>President of the United States'' that was highly critical of him, though it closed with a tepid endorsement</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Schachner, p</span>
				<span class='text'>396</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He mailed this to two hundred leading Federalists; when a copy fell into the Democratic-Republicans' hands, they printed it</span>
				<span class='text'>This hurt Adams's 1800 reelection campaign and split the Federalist Party, virtually assuring the victory of the Democratic-Republican Party, led by Jefferson, in the election of 1800; it destroyed Hamilton's position among the Federalists</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Elkins and McKitrick, like other historians, speak of Hamilton's self-destructive tendencies in this connection</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Jefferson had beaten Adams, but both he and his running mate, Aaron Burr, had received 73 votes in the Electoral College (Adams finished in third place, Pinckney in fourth, and Jay received one vote)</span>
				<span class='text'>With Jefferson and Burr tied, the United States House of Representatives had to choose between the two men</span>

				<span class='text'>399</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Several Federalists who opposed Jefferson supported Burr, and for the first 35 ballots, Jefferson was denied a majority</span>
				<span class='text'>Before the 36th ballot, Hamilton threw his weight behind Jefferson, supporting the arrangement reached by [[James A</span>
				<span class='text'>Bayard (elder)|James A</span>
				<span class='text'>Bayard]] of Delaware, in which five Federalist Representatives from Maryland and Vermont abstained from voting, allowing those states' delegations to go for Jefferson, ending the impasse and electing Jefferson President rather than Burr</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&gt;McDonald, p</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Even though Hamilton did not like Jefferson and disagreed with him on many issues, he viewed Jefferson as the [[Lesser of two evils principle|lesser of two evils]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Hamilton spoke of Jefferson as being &quot;by far not so a dangerous man&quot;, and that Burr was a &quot;mischievous enemy&quot; to the principle measure of the past administration</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Harper, p</span>
				<span class='text'>259</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; There is strong circumstantial evidence, however, that what Hamilton really feared was Burr's appeal to the members of the Federalist Party and loss of his control over them</span>
				<span class='text'>Many Federalists viewed Burr as a moderate who was willing to dialogue with them</span>
				<span class='text'>It was for that reason, along with the fact that Burr was a northerner and not a Virginian, that many Federalist Representatives voted for him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Isenberg, Nancy, ''Fallen Founder: The Life of Aaron Burr'', New York: Penguin Books, 2007, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>211–12</span>

				<span class='text'>353</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schachner2015/&gt; Nevertheless, Burr would become Vice President of the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>When it became clear that Jefferson had developed his own concerns about Burr and would not support his return to the Vice Presidency, Burr sought the New York governorship in 1804 with Federalist support, against the Jeffersonian [[Morgan Lewis (governor)|Morgan Lewis]], but was defeated by forces including Hamilton</span>

				<span class='text'>154–57</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton attacked his political opponents as demanding freedom for themselves and refusing to allow it to blacks</span>

				<span class='text'>34; Flexner, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>257–58</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In January 1785, Hamilton attended the second meeting of the [[New York Manumission Society]] (NYMS)</span>
				<span class='text'>John Jay was president and Hamilton was the first secretary and later became president</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McManus, p</span>
				<span class='text'>168</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Chernow notes how the membership soon included many of Hamilton's friends and associates</span>
				<span class='text'>Hamilton was a member of the committee of the society that petitioned the legislature to end the slave trade, and that succeeded in passing legislation banning the export of slaves from New York</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Chernow, p</span>
				<span class='text'>216</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In the same period, Hamilton felt bound by the rule of law of the time and his law practice facilitated the return of a fugitive slave to [[Henry Laurens]] of South Carolina</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Littlefield, p</span>
				<span class='text'>126, citing Syrett, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>3:605–8</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He opposed the compromise at the 1787 Constitutional Convention by which the federal government could not abolish the slave trade for 20 years, and was disappointed when he lost that argument</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Chernow, p</span>
				<span class='text'>239</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;/&gt;Hamilton never supported forced emigration for freed slaves</span>
				<span class='text'>Horton has argued from this that he would be comfortable with a multiracial society, and that this distinguished him from his contemporaries</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Horton, p</span>
				<span class='text'>22</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In international affairs, he supported [[Toussaint L'Ouverture]]'s black government in [[Haiti]] after the revolt that overthrew French control, as he had supported aid to the slaveowners in 1791—both measures hurt France</span>

				<span class='text'>97–8; Littlefield; Wills, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>35, 40</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Scant evidence has been interpreted by a few to indicate Hamilton may have owned household slaves, as did many wealthy New Yorkers (the evidence for this is indirect; McDonald interprets it as referring to paid employees)</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===On economics===Hamilton has been portrayed as the &quot;patron saint&quot; of the [[American School (economics)|American School]] of economic philosophy that, according to one historian, dominated economic policy after 1861</span>

				<span class='text'>xiv–xv, 229–30</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He firmly supported government intervention in favor of business, after the manner of [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]], as early as the fall of 1781</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Chernow, p</span>
				<span class='text'>170, citing ''Continentalist'' V, published April 1782, but written in fall 1781; Syrett, p</span>
				<span class='text'>3:77</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton opposed the British ideas of [[free trade]], which he believed skewed benefits to colonial and imperial powers, in favor of [[protectionism]], which he believed would help develop the fledgling nation's emerging economy</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Henry C</span>
				<span class='text'>Carey]] was inspired by his writings</span>
				<span class='text'>Hamilton influenced the ideas and work of the German [[Friedrich List]]</span>

				<span class='text'>rg/stable/1805356 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; In Hamilton's view, a strong executive, linked to the support of the people, could become the linchpin of an administrative republic</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Derthick|1999|p=122}} The dominance of executive leadership in the formulation and carrying out of policy was essential to resist the deterioration of republican government</span>
