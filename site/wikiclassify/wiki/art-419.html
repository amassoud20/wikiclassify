				<span class='text'>quot; He published almost exclusively within the science fiction genre, but dreamed of a career in mainstream American literature</span>
				<span class='text'>During the 1950s he produced a series of non-genre, relatively conventional novels</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;WWE-1963&quot;/&gt; Although he was hailed as a genius in the science fiction world, the mainstream literary world was unappreciative, and he could publish books only through low-paying science fiction publishers such as [[Ace Books|Ace]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Even in his later years, he continued to have financial troubles</span>
				<span class='text'>In the introduction to the 1980 short story collection ''The Golden Man'', Dick wrote::&quot;Several years ago, when I was ill, [[Robert A</span>
				<span class='text'>Heinlein|Heinlein]] offered his help, anything he could do, and we had never met; he would phone me to cheer me up and see how I was doing</span>
				<span class='text'>He wanted to buy me an electric [[typewriter]], God bless him—one of the few true gentlemen in this world</span>
				<span class='text'>I don't agree with any ideas he puts forth in his writing, but that is neither here nor there</span>
				<span class='text'>One time when I owed the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] a lot of money and couldn't raise it, Heinlein loaned the money to me</span>
				<span class='text'>I think a great deal of him and his wife; I dedicated a book to them in appreciation</span>
				<span class='text'>Robert Heinlein is a fine-looking man, very impressive and very military in stance; you can tell he has a military background, even to the haircut</span>
				<span class='text'>He knows I'm a flipped-out freak and still he helped me and my wife when we were in trouble</span>
				<span class='text'>That is the best in humanity, there; that is who and what I love</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;In 1972, Dick donated [[Manuscript format|manuscripts]], papers and other materials to the Special Collections Library at [[California State University, Fullerton]] where they are archived in the Philip K</span>

				<span class='text'>A factual account of Dick's recovery program participation was portrayed in his posthumously released book ''[[The Dark Haired Girl]]'', a collection of letters and journals from the period</span>

				<span class='text'>'[[A Scanner Darkly]]'' (1977) is a bleak mixture of science fiction and [[police procedural]] novels; in its story, an undercover narcotics police detective begins to lose touch with reality after falling victim to the same permanently mind-altering drug, Substance D, he was enlisted to help fight</span>
				<span class='text'>Substance D is instantly addictive, beginning with a pleasant euphoria which is quickly replaced with increasing confusion, hallucinations and eventually total psychosis</span>

				<span class='text'>From 1974 until his death in 1982, Dick spent many nights writing in this journal</span>
				<span class='text'>A recurring theme in ''Exegesis'' is Dick's hypothesis that history had been stopped in the first century CE, and that &quot;the [[Roman Empire|Empire]] never ended&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He saw Rome as the pinnacle of [[materialism]] and [[despotism]], which, after forcing the [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]] underground, had kept the population of Earth enslaved to worldly possessions</span>
