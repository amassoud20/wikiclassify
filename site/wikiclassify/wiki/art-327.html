				<span class='text'>He had, in fact, at one point in his life, joined a socialist association, and for a few months in 1919 even considered himself a communist</span>

				<span class='text'>He finally realised that when it came to sacrificing human lives, one was to think and act with extreme prudence</span>
				<span class='text'>opper was significantly traumatised by the failure of democratic parties to prevent fascism from taking over Austrian politics in the 1920s and 1930s</span>
				<span class='text'>He had suffered from the direct consequences of this failure since it was after the [[Anschluss]], the annexation of [[Austria]] by the [[German Reich]], that Popper was forced into permanent exile</span>
				<span class='text'>His most important works in the field of [[social science]]—''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'' (1944) and ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'' (1945)—were inspired by his reflection on the events of his time and were, in a way, a reaction to the prevalent [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] ideologies that then dominated Central European politics</span>
				<span class='text'>His books were defences of [[democratic liberalism]] as a social and [[political philosophy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>They also represented extensive critiques of the philosophical presuppositions underpinning all forms of [[totalitarianism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;plato</span>
				<span class='text'>tanford&quot; /&gt;Popper was also puzzled by the stark contrast between the non-scientific character of [[Freudian psychology|Freud]] and [[Alfred Adler|Adler]]'s theories in the field of [[psychology]] and the revolution set off by [[Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]] in [[physics]] in the early 20th century</span>
				<span class='text'>Karl Popper thought that Einstein's theory, as a theory properly grounded in scientific thought and method, was highly &quot;risky&quot;, in the sense that it was possible to deduce consequences from it which were, in the light of the then dominant [[Newtonian physics]], highly improbable (e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> that light is deflected towards solid bodies—confirmed by Eddington's experiments in 1919), and which would, if they turned out to be false, falsify the whole theory</span>
				<span class='text'>In contrast, nothing could, even in principle, falsify psychoanalytic theories</span>
				<span class='text'>He thus came to the conclusion that such theories had more in common with primitive myths than with genuine science</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;plato</span>
				<span class='text'>tanford&quot; /&gt;This led Karl Popper to conclude that what were regarded as the remarkable strengths of psychoanalytical theories were actually their weaknesses</span>
				<span class='text'>Psychoanalytical theories were crafted in a way that made them able to refute any criticism and give an explanation for every possible form of human behaviour</span>
				<span class='text'>The nature of such theories made it impossible for any criticism or experiment even in principle to show them to be false</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;plato</span>
				<span class='text'>tanford&quot; /&gt; This realisation had an important consequence when he later tackled the problem of demarcation in the philosophy of science, as it led him to posit that the strength of a scientific theory lies in its both being susceptible to falsification, and not actually being falsified by criticism made of it</span>
				<span class='text'>He considered that if a theory cannot, in principle, be falsified by criticism, it is not a scientific theory</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;One of the severest critics of Popper's so-called demarcation thesis was Adolf Grünbaum, 'Is Falsifiability the Touchstone of Scientific Rationality?' (1976), and 'The Degeneration of Popper's Theory of Demarcation' (1989), both in his ''Collected Works'' (edited by Thomas Kupka), vol</span>

				<span class='text'>1 (pp</span>
				<span class='text'>9–42) &amp; ch</span>
				<span class='text'>2 (43–61)&lt;/ref&gt;===Philosophy of science=======Falsifiability/problem of demarcation====Popper coined the term &quot;critical rationalism&quot; to describe his philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>Concerning the method of science, the term indicates his rejection of classical [[empiricism]], and the classical [[inductivism|observationalist-inductivist]] account of science that had grown out of it</span>
				<span class='text'>Popper argued strongly against the latter, holding that [[scientific theories]] are abstract in nature, and can be tested only indirectly, by reference to their implications</span>
				<span class='text'>He also held that scientific theory, and human knowledge generally, is irreducibly conjectural or hypothetical, and is generated by the creative imagination to solve problems that have arisen in specific historico-cultural settings</span>
				<span class='text'>ogically, no number of positive outcomes at the level of experimental testing can confirm a scientific theory, but a single counterexample is logically decisive: it shows the theory, from which the implication is derived, to be false</span>
				<span class='text'>To say that a given statement (e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> the statement of a law of some scientific theory) -- [call it &quot;T&quot;] -- is &quot;[[falsifiable]]&quot; does not mean that &quot;T&quot; is false</span>
				<span class='text'>Rather, it means  that, '''if''' &quot;T&quot; is false, '''then''' (in principle), &quot;T&quot; could be '''''shown''' to be'' false, by observation or by experiment</span>
				<span class='text'>Popper's account of the logical asymmetry between [[Verification theory|verification]] and [[falsifiability]] lies at the heart of his philosophy of science</span>
				<span class='text'>It also inspired him to take falsifiability as his criterion of [[Demarcation problem|demarcation]] between what is, and is not, genuinely scientific: a theory should be considered scientific if, and only if, it is falsifiable</span>
				<span class='text'>This led him to attack the claims of both [[psychoanalysis]] and contemporary [[Marxism]] to scientific status, on the basis that their theories are not falsifiable</span>
				<span class='text'>opper also wrote extensively against the famous [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of [[quantum mechanics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He strongly disagreed with [[Niels Bohr]]'s [[instrumentalism]] and supported [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[scientific realism|realist]] approach to scientific theories about the universe</span>
				<span class='text'>Popper's falsifiability resembles [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles Peirce]]'s nineteenth century [[fallibilism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''Of Clocks and Clouds'' (1966), Popper remarked that he wished he had known of Peirce's work earlier</span>
				<span class='text'>n ''All Life is Problem Solving'', Popper sought to explain the apparent progress of scientific knowledge – that is, how it is that our understanding of the universe seems to improve over time</span>
				<span class='text'>This problem arises from his position that the truth content of our theories, even the best of them, cannot be verified by scientific testing, but can only be falsified</span>
				<span class='text'>Again, in this context the word &quot;falsified&quot; does not refer to something being &quot;fake&quot;; rather, that something can be (i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> is ''capable'' of being) shown to be false by observation or experiment</span>
				<span class='text'>Some things simply do not lend themselves to being shown to be false, and therefore, are not falsifiable</span>
				<span class='text'>If so, then how is it that the growth of science appears to result in a [[The growth of knowledge|growth in knowledge]]? In Popper's view, the advance of scientific knowledge is an ''evolutionary'' process characterised by his formula:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{PS}_1 \rightarrow \mathrm{TT}_1 \rightarrow \mathrm{EE}_1 \rightarrow \mathrm{PS}_2</span>
				<span class='text'>\, &lt;/math&gt;In response to a given problem situation (&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{PS}_1&lt;/math&gt;), a number of competing conjectures, or tentative theories (&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{TT}&lt;/math&gt;), are systematically subjected to the most rigorous attempts at falsification possible</span>
				<span class='text'>This process, error elimination (&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{EE}&lt;/math&gt;), performs a similar function for science that [[natural selection]] performs for [[biological evolution]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Theories that better survive the process of refutation are not more true, but rather, more &quot;fit&quot;—in other words, more applicable to the problem situation at hand (&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{PS}_1&lt;/math&gt;)</span>
				<span class='text'>Consequently, just as a species' biological fitness does not ensure continued survival, neither does rigorous testing protect a scientific theory from refutation in the future</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet, as it appears that the engine of biological evolution has, over many generations, produced adaptive traits equipped to deal with more and more complex problems of survival, likewise, the evolution of theories through the scientific method may, in Popper's view, reflect a certain type of progress: toward more and more interesting problems (&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{PS}_2&lt;/math&gt;)</span>
				<span class='text'>For Popper, it is in the interplay between the tentative theories (conjectures) and error elimination (refutation) that scientific knowledge advances toward greater and greater problems; in a process very much akin to the interplay between genetic variation and natural selection</span>
				<span class='text'>===Falsification/problem of induction====Among his contributions to philosophy is his claim to have solved the philosophical [[problem of induction]]</span>
				<span class='text'> He states that while there is no way to prove that the sun will rise, it is possible to formulate the theory that every day the sun will rise; if it does not rise on some particular day, the theory will be falsified and will have to be replaced by a different one</span>
				<span class='text'>Until that day, there is no need to reject the assumption that the theory is true</span>
				<span class='text'>Nor is it rational according to Popper to make instead the more complex assumption that the sun will rise until a given day, but will stop doing so the day after, or similar statements with additional conditions</span>
				<span class='text'>uch a theory would be true with higher probability, because it cannot be attacked so easily: to falsify the first one, it is sufficient to find that the sun has stopped rising; to falsify the second one, one additionally needs the assumption that the given day has not yet been reached</span>
				<span class='text'>Popper held that it is the least likely, or most easily falsifiable, or simplest theory (attributes which he identified as all the same thing) that explains known facts that one should rationally prefer</span>
				<span class='text'>His opposition to positivism, which held that it is the theory most likely to be true that one should prefer, here becomes very apparent</span>
				<span class='text'>It is impossible, Popper argues, to ensure a theory to be true; it is more important that its falsity can be detected as easily as possible</span>
				<span class='text'>opper and [[David Hume]] agreed that there is often a psychological belief that the sun will rise tomorrow, but both denied that there is logical justification for the supposition that it will, simply because it always has in the past</span>
				<span class='text'>Popper writes, &quot;I approached the problem of induction through Hume</span>
				<span class='text'>Hume, I felt, was perfectly right in pointing out that induction cannot be logically justified</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; (''Conjectures and Refutations'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;55)===Rationality===Popper held that rationality is not restricted to the realm of empirical or scientific theories, but that it is merely a special case of the general method of criticism, the method of finding and eliminating contradictions in knowledge without ad-hoc-measures</span>
				<span class='text'>According to this view, rational discussion about metaphysical ideas, about moral values and even about purposes is possible</span>
				<span class='text'>Popper's student [[William W</span>
				<span class='text'>Bartley|W</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Bartley III]] tried to radicalise this idea and made the controversial claim that not only can criticism go beyond empirical knowledge, but that everything can be rationally criticised</span>
				<span class='text'>o Popper, who was an anti-[[justificationism|justificationist]], traditional philosophy is misled by the false [[principle of sufficient reason]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He thinks that no assumption can ever be or needs ever to be justified, so a lack of justification is not a justification for doubt</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, theories should be tested and scrutinised</span>
				<span class='text'>It is not the goal to bless theories with claims of certainty or justification, but to eliminate errors in them</span>
				<span class='text'>He writes, &quot;there ''are'' no such things as good positive reasons; nor do we need such things [</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> But [philosophers] obviously cannot quite bring [themselves] to believe that this is my opinion, let alone that it is right&quot; (''The Philosophy of Karl Popper'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;1043)===Philosophy of arithmetic===Popper's principle of falsifiability runs into ''prima facie'' difficulties when the epistemological status of mathematics is considered</span>
				<span class='text'>It is difficult to conceive how simple statements of arithmetic, such as &quot;2 + 2 = 4&quot;, could ever be shown to be false</span>
				<span class='text'>If they are not open to falsification they can not be scientific</span>
				<span class='text'>If they are not scientific, it needs to be explained how they can be informative about real world objects and events</span>
				<span class='text'>opper's solution&lt;ref&gt;Popper, Karl Raimund (1946) Aristotelian Society Supplementary Volume XX</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; was an original contribution in the [[philosophy of mathematics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His idea was that a number statement such as &quot;2 apples + 2 apples = 4 apples&quot; can be taken in two senses</span>
				<span class='text'>In one sense it is irrefutable and [[logical truth|logically true]], in the second sense it is factually true and falsifiable</span>
				<span class='text'>Concisely, the pure mathematics &quot;2 + 2 = 4&quot; is always true, but, when the formula is applied to real world apples, it is open to falsification</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Political philosophy==={{Liberalism sidebar}}In ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'' and ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'', Popper developed a critique of [[historicism]] and a defence of the &quot;Open Society&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Popper considered historicism to be the theory that history develops inexorably and necessarily according to knowable general laws towards a determinate end</span>
				<span class='text'>He argued that this view is the principal theoretical presupposition underpinning most forms of [[authoritarianism]] and [[totalitarianism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He argued that historicism is founded upon mistaken assumptions regarding the nature of scientific law and prediction</span>
				<span class='text'>Since the growth of human knowledge is a causal factor in the evolution of human history, and since &quot;no society can predict, scientifically, its own future states of knowledge&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;The Poverty of Historicism, page 21&lt;/ref&gt; it follows, he argued, that there can be no predictive science of human history</span>
				<span class='text'>For Popper, metaphysical and historical indeterminism go hand in hand</span>
				<span class='text'>n his early years Popper was impressed by Marxism, whether of Communists or socialists</span>
				<span class='text'> An event that happened in 1919 had a profound effect on him: During a riot, caused by the Communists, the police shot several unarmed people, including some of Popper's friends, when they tried to free party comrades from prison</span>
				<span class='text'>The riot had, in fact, been part of a plan by which leaders of the Communist party with connections to [[Béla Kun]] tried to take power by a coup; Popper did not know about this at that time</span>
				<span class='text'>However, he knew that the riot instigators were swayed by the Marxist doctrine that class struggle would produce vastly more dead men than the inevitable revolution brought about as quickly as possible, and so had no scruples to put the life of the rioters at risk to achieve their selfish goal of becoming the future leaders of the working class</span>
				<span class='text'>This was the start of his later criticism of historicism</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;====The paradox of tolerance===={{Main|Paradox of tolerance}}Although Popper was an advocate of toleration, he said that intolerance should not be tolerated, for if tolerance allowed intolerance to succeed completely, tolerance would be threatened</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', he argued:{{quote|Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance</span>
				<span class='text'>If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them</span>
				<span class='text'>– In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be most unwise</span>
				<span class='text'>But we should claim the ''right'' to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols</span>
				<span class='text'>We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant</span>
				<span class='text'>We should claim that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside the law, and we should consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal, in the same way as we should consider incitement to murder, or to kidnapping, or to the revival of the slave trade, as criminal</span>

				<span class='text'>Then came the [[semantic theory of truth]] formulated by the logician [[Alfred Tarski]] and published in 1933</span>
				<span class='text'>Popper writes of learning in 1935 of the consequences of Tarski's theory, to his intense joy</span>
				<span class='text'>The theory met critical objections to [[truth]] as correspondence and thereby rehabilitated it</span>
				<span class='text'>The theory also seemed, in Popper's eyes, to support [[metaphysical realism]] and the regulative idea of a search for truth</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to this theory, the conditions for the truth of a sentence as well as the sentences themselves are part of a [[metalanguage]]</span>
				<span class='text'>So, for example, the sentence &quot;Snow is white&quot; is true if and only if snow is white</span>
				<span class='text'>Although many philosophers have interpreted, and continue to interpret, Tarski's theory as a [[Deflationary theory of truth|deflationary theory]], Popper refers to it as a theory in which &quot;is true&quot; is replaced with &quot;[[correspondence theory|corresponds to the facts]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He bases this interpretation on the fact that examples such as the one described above refer to two things: assertions and the facts to which they refer</span>
				<span class='text'>He identifies Tarski's formulation of the truth conditions of sentences as the introduction of a &quot;metalinguistic predicate&quot; and distinguishes the following cases:# &quot;John called&quot; is true</span>
				<span class='text'> &quot;It is true that John called</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;The first case belongs to the metalanguage whereas the second is more likely to belong to the object language</span>
				<span class='text'>Hence, &quot;it is true that&quot; possesses the logical status of a redundancy</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Is true&quot;, on the other hand, is a predicate necessary for making general observations such as &quot;John was telling the truth about Phillip</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;Upon this basis, along with that of the logical content of assertions (where logical content is inversely proportional to probability), Popper went on to develop his important notion of [[verisimilitude]] or &quot;truthlikeness&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The intuitive idea behind verisimilitude is that the assertions or hypotheses of scientific theories can be objectively measured with respect to the amount of truth and falsity that they imply</span>
				<span class='text'>And, in this way, one theory can be evaluated as more or less true than another on a quantitative basis which, Popper emphasises forcefully, has nothing to do with &quot;subjective probabilities&quot; or other merely &quot;epistemic&quot; considerations</span>
				<span class='text'>he simplest mathematical formulation that Popper gives of this concept can be found in the tenth chapter of ''[[Conjectures and Refutations]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Here he defines it as:: &lt;math&gt;\mathit{Vs}(a)=\mathit{CT}_v(a)-\mathit{CT}_f(a) \,&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt;\mathit{Vs}(a)&lt;/math&gt; is the verisimilitude of ''a'', &lt;math&gt;\mathit{CT}_v(a)&lt;/math&gt; is a measure of the content of the truth of ''a'', and &lt;math&gt;\mathit{CT}_f(a)&lt;/math&gt; is a measure of the content of the falsity of ''a''</span>
				<span class='text'>opper's original attempt to define not just verisimilitude, but an actual measure of it, turned out to be inadequate</span>
				<span class='text'>However, it inspired a wealth of new attempts</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> knowledge as object) independent of the knowing subject (''Objective Knowledge: An Evolutionary Approach'', 1972)</span>
				<span class='text'>He proposed [[Popper's three worlds|three worlds]]:&lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper, Three Worlds, The Tanner Lecture on Human Values, The University of Michigan, 1978</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; World One, being the physical world, or physical states; World Two, being the world of mind, or mental states, ideas, and perceptions; and World Three, being the body of human knowledge expressed in its manifold forms, or the products of the second world made manifest in the materials of the first world (i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> books, papers, paintings, symphonies, and all the products of the human mind)</span>
				<span class='text'>World Three, he argued, was the product of individual human beings in exactly the same sense that an animal path is the product of individual animals, and that, as such, has an existence and evolution independent of any individual knowing subjects</span>
				<span class='text'>The influence of World Three, in his view, on the individual human mind (World Two) is at least as strong as the influence of World One</span>
				<span class='text'>In other words, the knowledge held by a given individual mind owes at least as much to the total accumulated wealth of human knowledge, made manifest, as to the world of direct experience</span>
				<span class='text'>As such, the growth of human knowledge could be said to be a function of the independent evolution of World Three</span>
				<span class='text'>Many contemporary philosophers, such as Daniel Dennett, have not embraced Popper's Three World conjecture, due mostly, it seems, to its resemblance to [[mind-body dualism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>===Origin and evolution of life====The [[creation–evolution controversy]] in the United States raises the issue of whether creationistic ideas may be legitimately called science and whether evolution itself may be legitimately called science</span>
				<span class='text'>In the debate, both sides and even courts in their decisions have frequently invoked Popper's criterion of falsifiability (see [[Daubert standard]])</span>
				<span class='text'>In this context, passages written by Popper are frequently quoted in which he speaks about such issues himself</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, he famously stated &quot;[[Darwinism]] is not a testable scientific theory, but a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] research program—a possible framework for testable scientific theories</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He continued:{{quote|And yet, the theory is invaluable</span>
				<span class='text'>I do not see how, without it, our knowledge could have grown as it has done since Darwin</span>
				<span class='text'>In trying to explain experiments with bacteria which become adapted to, say, [[penicillin]], it is quite clear that we are greatly helped by the theory of natural selection</span>
				<span class='text'>Although it is metaphysical, it sheds much light upon very concrete and very practical researches</span>
				<span class='text'>It allows us to study adaptation to a new environment (such as a penicillin-infested environment) in a rational way: it suggests the existence of a mechanism of adaptation, and it allows us even to study in detail the mechanism at work</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Unended Quest'' ch</span>
				<span class='text'>37 – see Bibliography&lt;/ref&gt;}}He also noted that [[theism]], presented as explaining adaptation, &quot;was worse than an open admission of failure, for it created the impression that an ultimate explanation had been reached&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>This is an immensely impressive and powerful theory</span>
				<span class='text'>The claim that it completely explains evolution is of course a bold claim, and very far from being established</span>
				<span class='text'>All scientific theories are conjectures, even those that have successfully passed many severe and varied tests</span>
				<span class='text'>The Mendelian underpinning of modern Darwinism has been well tested, and so has the theory of evolution which says that all terrestrial life has evolved from a few primitive unicellular organisms, possibly even from one single organism</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;popper_on_natural_selection&quot;/&gt;}}In 1974, regarding DNA and the origin of life he said:{{quote|What makes the origin of life and of the genetic code a disturbing riddle is this: the genetic code is without any biological function unless it is translated; that is, unless it leads to the synthesis of the proteins whose structure is laid down by the code</span>
				<span class='text'>But, as Monod points out, the machinery by which the cell (at least the non-primitive cell, which is the only one we know) translates the code &quot;consists of at least fifty macromolecular components ''which are themselves coded in the DNA''&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>hus the code can not be translated except by using certain products of its translation</span>
				<span class='text'>This constitutes a really baffling circle; a vicious circle, it seems, for any attempt to form a model, or theory, of the genesis of the genetic code</span>
				<span class='text'>hus we may be faced with the possibility that the origin of life (like the origin of the universe) becomes an impenetrable barrier to science, and a residue to all attempts to reduce biology to chemistry and physics</span>

				<span class='text'>It raises detailed problems in many fields, and it tells us what we would expect of an acceptable solution of these problems</span>
				<span class='text'>I still believe that natural selection works in this way as a research programme</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, I have changed my mind about the testability and logical status of the theory of natural selection; and I am glad to have an opportunity to make a recantation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;popper_on_natural_selection&quot;/&gt;}}Popper summarised his new view as follows:{{quote|The theory of natural selection may be so formulated that it is far from tautological</span>
				<span class='text'>In this case it is not only testable, but it turns out to be not strictly universally true</span>
				<span class='text'>There seem to be exceptions, as with so many biological theories; and considering the random character of the variations on which natural selection operates, the occurrence of exceptions is not surprising</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus not all phenomena of evolution are explained by natural selection alone</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet in every particular case it is a challenging research program to show how far natural selection can possibly be held responsible for the evolution of a particular organ or behavioural program</span>

				<span class='text'>Popper never invented this criterion to give justifiable use of words like science</span>
				<span class='text'>In fact, Popper says at the beginning of ''Logic of Scientific Discovery'' that it is not his aim to define science, and that science can in fact be defined quite arbitrarily</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In effect, Popper agreed with some of the points of both creationists and naturalists, but also disagreed with both views on crucial aspects</span>
				<span class='text'>Popper understood the universe as a creative entity that invents new things, including life, but without the necessity of something like a god, especially not one who is pulling strings from behind the curtain</span>
				<span class='text'>He said that evolution must, as the creationists say, work in a goal-directed way&lt;ref&gt;D</span>

				<span class='text'>nstead, he formulated the spearhead model of evolution, a version of genetic pluralism</span>
				<span class='text'>According to this model, living organisms themselves have goals, and act according to these goals, each guided by a central control</span>
				<span class='text'>In its most sophisticated form, this is the brain of humans, but controls also exist in much less sophisticated ways for species of lower complexity, such as the [[amoeba]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This control organ plays a special role in evolution—it is the &quot;spearhead of evolution&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The goals bring the purpose into the world</span>
				<span class='text'>Mutations in the genes that determine the structure of the control may then cause drastic changes in behaviour, preferences and goals, without having an impact on the organism's [[phenotype]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Popper postulates that such purely behavioural changes are less likely to be lethal for the organism compared to drastic changes of the phenotype</span>

				<span class='text'>After behaviour has changed radically, small but quick changes of the phenotype follow to make the organism fitter to its changed goals</span>
				<span class='text'>This way it looks as if the phenotype were changing guided by some invisible hand, while it is merely natural selection working in combination with the new behaviour</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, according to this hypothesis, the eating habits of the giraffe must have changed before its elongated neck evolved</span>

				<span class='text'>Popper founded in 1946 the Department of Philosophy, Logic and Scientific Method at the [[London School of Economics]] and there lectured and influenced both [[Imre Lakatos]] and [[Paul Feyerabend]], two of the foremost philosophers of science in the next generation of philosophy of science</span>
				<span class='text'>(Lakatos significantly modified Popper's position, and Feyerabend repudiated it entirely, but the work of both is deeply influenced by Popper and engaged with many of the problems that Popper set</span>
				<span class='text'>While there is some dispute as to the matter of influence, Popper had a long-standing and close friendship with economist [[Friedrich Hayek]], who was also brought to the London School of Economics from Vienna</span>
				<span class='text'>Each found support and similarities in the other's work, citing each other often, though not without qualification</span>
				<span class='text'>In a letter to Hayek in 1944, Popper stated, &quot;I think I have learnt more from you than from any other living thinker, except perhaps [[Alfred Tarski]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Thus we can only say that the whole package of relevant theories has been collectively falsified, but cannot conclusively say which element of the package must be replaced</span>
				<span class='text'>An example of this is given by the discovery of the planet [[Neptune]]: when the motion of [[Uranus]] was found not to match the predictions of Newton's laws, the theory &quot;There are seven planets in the solar system&quot; was rejected, and not Newton's laws themselves</span>
				<span class='text'>Popper discussed this critique of [[Falsifiability#Naïve|naïve falsificationism]] in Chapters 3 and 4 of ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>For Popper, theories are accepted or rejected via a sort of selection process</span>
				<span class='text'>Theories that say more about the way things appear are to be preferred over those that do not; the more generally applicable a theory is, the greater its value</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus Newton's laws, with their wide general application, are to be preferred over the much more specific &quot;the solar system has seven planets&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>On the contrary, it is just the incompleteness and imperfection of the existing data-theory fit that, at any given time, define many of the puzzles that characterize normal science</span>
				<span class='text'>If any and every failure to fit were ground for theory rejection, all theories ought to be rejected at all times</span>
				<span class='text'>On the other hand, if only severe failure to fit justifies theory rejection, then the Popperians will require some criterion of &quot;improbability&quot; or of &quot;degree of falsification&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'> In developing one they will almost certainly encounter the same network of difficulties that has haunted the advocates of the various probabilistic verification theories [that the evaluative theory cannot itself be legitimated without appeal to another evaluative theory, leading to regress]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author=Kuhn, Thomas | authorlink= | author2= | title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions | year=1970 | publisher=University of Chicago Press | location=Chicago | isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;|}}Popper's student [[Imre Lakatos]] attempted to reconcile Kuhn's work with [[falsificationism]] by arguing that science progresses by the falsification of ''research programs'' rather than the more specific [[universal quantification|universal statements]] of naïve falsificationism</span>
				<span class='text'>Another of Popper's students [[Paul Feyerabend]] ultimately rejected any prescriptive methodology, and argued that the only universal method characterising scientific progress was ''anything goes''</span>
				<span class='text'>opper claimed to have recognised already in the 1934 version of his ''Logic of Discovery'' a fact later stressed by Kuhn, &quot;that scientists necessarily develop their ideas within a definite theoretical framework&quot;, and to that extent to have anticipated Kuhn's central point about &quot;normal science&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;) Also, in his collection ''[[Conjectures and Refutations]]: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge'' (Harper &amp; Row, 1963), Popper writes, &quot;Science must begin with myths, and with the criticism of myths; neither with the collection of observations, nor with the invention of experiments, but with the critical discussion of myths, and of magical techniques and practices</span>
				<span class='text'>The scientific tradition is distinguished from the pre-scientific tradition in having two layers</span>
				<span class='text'>Like the latter, it passes on its theories; but it also passes on a critical attitude towards them</span>
				<span class='text'>The theories are passed on, not as dogmas, but rather with the challenge to discuss them and improve upon them</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;Another objection is that it is not always possible to demonstrate falsehood definitively, especially if one is using [[statistical significance|statistical]] criteria to evaluate a [[null hypothesis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>More generally it is not always clear, if evidence contradicts a hypothesis, that this is a sign of flaws in the hypothesis rather than of flaws in the evidence</span>
				<span class='text'>However, this is a misunderstanding of what Popper's philosophy of science sets out to do</span>
				<span class='text'>Rather than offering a set of instructions that merely need to be followed diligently to achieve science, Popper makes it clear in ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery'' that his belief is that the resolution of conflicts between hypotheses and observations can only be a matter of the collective judgment of scientists, in each individual case</span>

				<span class='text'>65]&lt;/ref&gt; that Popper's falsificationism can be questioned logically: it is not clear how Popper would deal with a statement like &quot;for every metal, there is a temperature at which it will melt</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The hypothesis cannot be falsified by any possible observation, for there will always be a higher temperature than tested at which the metal may in fact melt, yet it seems to be a valid scientific hypothesis</span>
				<span class='text'>These examples were pointed out by [[Carl Gustav Hempel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Hempel came to acknowledge that Logical Positivism's verificationism was untenable, but argued that falsificationism was equally untenable on logical grounds alone</span>
				<span class='text'>The simplest response to this is that, because Popper describes how theories attain, maintain and lose scientific status, individual consequences of currently accepted scientific theories are scientific in the sense of being part of tentative scientific knowledge, and both of Hempel's examples fall under this category</span>
				<span class='text'>For instance, [[atomic theory]] implies that all metals melt at some temperature</span>
				<span class='text'>n early adversary of Popper's critical rationalism, [[Karl-Otto Apel]] attempted a comprehensive refutation of Popper's philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''Transformation der Philosophie'' (1973), Apel charged Popper with being guilty of, amongst other things, a pragmatic contradiction</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See: &quot;Apel, Karl-Otto,&quot; ''La philosophie de A a Z'', by Elizabeth Clement, Chantal Demonque, Laurence Hansen-Love, and Pierre Kahn, Paris, 1994, Hatier, 19–20</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;[[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] accuses Popper of exploiting his worldwide fame as an [[epistemologist]] to diminish the importance of philosophers of the 20th century [[continental philosophy|continental tradition]]</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Taylor, Popper's criticisms are completely baseless, but they are received with an attention and respect that Popper's &quot;intrinsic worth hardly merits&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Charles, &quot;Overcoming Epistemology&quot;, in ''Philosophical Arguments'', Harvard University Press, 1995, ISBN 0-674-66477-9&lt;/ref&gt;In 2004, philosopher and [[psychologist]] Michel ter Hark ([[Groningen (city)|Groningen]], The Netherlands) published a book, called ''Popper, Otto Selz and the rise of evolutionary epistemology'', in which he claimed that Popper took some of his ideas from his tutor, the German psychologist [[Otto Selz]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Selz never published his ideas, partly because of the rise of [[Nazism]], which forced him to quit his work in 1933, and the prohibition of referring to Selz' work</span>
				<span class='text'>Popper, the historian of ideas and his scholarship, is criticised in some academic quarters for his rejection of Plato, Hegel and Marx</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See: &quot;Popper is committing a serious historical error in attributing the organic theory of the state to Plato and accusing him of all the fallacies of post-Hegelian and Marxist historicism—the theory that history is controlled by the inexorable laws governing the behavior of superindividual social entities of which human beings and their free choices are merely subordinate manifestations</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; ''Plato's Modern Enemies and the Theory of Natural Law'', by John Wild, Chicago, 1964, The University of Chicago Press, 23</span>
				<span class='text'>See Also: &quot;In spite of the high rating one must accord his initial intention of fairness, his hatred for the enemies of the 'open society,' his zeal to destroy whatever seems to him destructive of the welfare of mankind, has led him into the extensive use of what may be called terminological counterpropaganda </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot; and &quot;With a few exceptions in Popper's favor, however, it is noticeable that reviewers possessed of special competence in particular fields—and here Lindsay is again to be included—have objected to Popper's conclusions in those very fields </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot; and &quot;Social scientists and social philosophers have deplored his radical denial of historical causation, together with his espousal of Hayek's systematic distrust of larger programs of social reform; historical students of philosophy have protested his violent polemical handling of Plato, Aristotle, and particularly Hegel; ethicists have found contradictions in the ethical theory ('critical dualism') upon which his polemic is largely based</span>

				<span class='text'>Levinson]], New York, 1970, Russell and Russell, 20</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;According to [[John N</span>
				<span class='text'>Gray]], Popper held that &quot;a theory is scientific only in so far as it is falsifiable, and should be given up as soon as it is falsified</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;John Gray, Straw Dogs, p</span>
				<span class='text'>2 Granta Books, London, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; By applying Popper's account of scientific method, Gray's ''Straw Dogs'' states that this would have &quot;killed the theories of Darwin and Einstein at birth</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; When they were first advanced, Gray claims, each of them was &quot;at odds with some available evidence; only later did evidence become available that gave them crucial support</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;John Gray, Straw Dogs, Granta Books, London, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Against this, Gray seeks to establish the [[Irrationalist#Irrationalist|irrationalist]] thesis that &quot;the progress of science comes from acting against reason</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;John Gray, Straw Dogs, p</span>
				<span class='text'>2, Granta Books, London, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;Gray does not, however, give any indication of what available evidence these theories were at odds with, and his appeal to &quot;crucial support&quot; illustrates the very [[Inductivism|inductivist]] approach to science that Popper sought to show was logically illegitimate</span>
				<span class='text'>For, according to Popper, Einstein's theory was at least equally as well corroborated as Newton's upon its initial conception; they both equally well accounted for all the hitherto available evidence</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, since Einstein also explained the empirical refutations of Newton's theory, general relativity was immediately deemed suitable for tentative acceptance on the Popperian account</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper, Replies to my Critics, Open Court, London, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Popper wrote, several decades before Gray's criticism, in reply to a critical essay by [[Imre Lakatos]]:{{quote|It is true that I have used the terms &quot;elimination&quot;, and even &quot;rejection&quot; when discussing &quot;refutation&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>But it is clear from my main discussion that these terms mean, when applied to a scientific theory, that it is eliminated as a contender for the truth- that is, refuted, but not necessarily abandoned</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, I have often pointed out that any such refutation is fallible</span>
				<span class='text'>It is a typical matter of conjecture and of risk-taking whether or not we accept a refutation and, furthermore, of whether we &quot;abandon&quot; a theory or, say, only modify it, or even stick to it, and try to find some alternative, and methodologically acceptable, way round the problem involved</span>
				<span class='text'>That I do not conflate even admitted falsity with the need to abandon a theory may be seen from the fact that I have frequently pointed out, that Einstein regarded general relativity as false, yet as a better approximation to the truth than Newton's gravitational theory</span>
				<span class='text'>He certainly did not &quot;abandon&quot; it</span>
				<span class='text'>But he worked to the end of his life in an attempt to improve upon it by way of a further generalization</span>
