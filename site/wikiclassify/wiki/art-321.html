				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; was an English [[scholastic philosopher]], [[theologian]], Biblical translator, reformer, seminary professor at Oxford</span>
				<span class='text'>He was an influential dissident within the [[Roman Catholic]] priesthood during the 14th century</span>
				<span class='text'>In assessing Wycliffe’s historical role, [[Lacey Baldwin Smith]] argues that Wycliffe expounded three doctrines that the [[Roman Catholic Church]] recognized as subversive</span>
				<span class='text'> First was his emphasis upon private interpretation of the Bible as the best guide to a moral life, as opposed to the Church’s additional emphasis on good works and the reception of the Sacraments as vitally important to salvation</span>
				<span class='text'> Wycliffe also attacked the privileged status of the clergy, which was central to their powerful role in England</span>
				<span class='text'> Finally he attacked the luxury and pomp of local parishes and their ceremonies</span>

				<span class='text'>1976), p</span>
				<span class='text'>41&lt;/ref&gt;Wycliffe was also an advocate for translation of the [[Bible]] into the [[vernacular]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He completed a translation directly from the [[Vulgate]] into [[Middle English]] in the year 1382, now known as [[Wycliffe's Bible]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It is probable that he personally translated the Gospels of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], and [[Gospel of John|John]]; and it is possible he translated the entire [[New Testament]], while his associates translated the [[Old Testament]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Wycliffe's Bible appears to have been completed by 1384, with additional updated versions being done by Wycliffe's assistant [[John Purvey]] and others in 1388 and 1395</span>
				<span class='text'>ycliffe's followers were known as [[Lollards]] and followed his lead in advocating [[Predestination]], [[Iconoclasm]], and [[Caesaropapism]], while attacking the veneration of Saints, the [[Sacraments]], [[Requiem Mass]]es, [[Transubstantiation]], monasticism, and the very existence of the Papacy</span>
				<span class='text'>Beginning in the 16th century, the Lollard movement  was regarded as the precursor to the [[Protestant Reformation]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Wycliffe was accordingly characterized as the evening star of scholasticism and the [[Eosphoros|Morning Star]] of the [[English Reformation]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Urquhart/&gt; Gaunt declared that he would humble the pride of the English clergy and their partisans, hinting at the intent to secularise the possessions of the Church</span>
				<span class='text'>The assembly broke up and the lords departed with their [[protégé]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;An excellent account of this dispute between the bishop and the protectors of Wycliffe is given in the ''Chronicon Angliae'', the gist of which is quoted in ''DNB'', lxiii</span>

				<span class='text'>V</span>
				<span class='text'>Lechler]] identifies three stages in Wycliffe's relations with the papacy</span>
				<span class='text'>The first step, which carried him to the outbreak of the [[Schism (religion)|schism]], involves moderate recognition of the [[Primacy of the Roman Pontiff|papal primacy]]; the second, which carried him to 1381, is marked by an estrangement from the papacy; and the third shows him in sharp contest</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|John Wycliffe portrayed in [[John Bale|Bale]]'s ''Scriptor Majoris Britanniæ'' 1548</span>
				<span class='text'>]In keeping with Wycliffe's belief that scripture was the only authoritative reliable guide to the truth about God, he became involved in efforts to translate the Bible into English</span>
				<span class='text'>While Wycliffe is credited, it is not possible exactly to define his part in the translation, which was based on the [[Vulgate]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;walker&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Walker |first=Williston |title=A History of the Christian Church |location=New York, NY |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |date=1958 |page=269 |asin=B00087NRC8}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no doubt that it was his initiative, and that the success of the project was due to his leadership</span>
				<span class='text'>From him comes the translation of the [[New Testament]], which was smoother, clearer, and more readable than the rendering of the [[Old Testament]] by his friend [[Nicholas of Hereford]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The whole was revised by Wycliffe's younger contemporary [[John Purvey]] in 1388</span>
				<span class='text'>here still exist about 150 manuscripts, complete or partial, containing the translation in its revised form</span>
				<span class='text'>From this, one may easily infer how widely diffused it was in the 15th century</span>
				<span class='text'>For this reason the Wycliffites in England were often designated by their opponents as &quot;Bible men&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>= Anti-Wycliffe synod ==In the summer of 1381 Wycliffe formulated his doctrine of the Lord's Supper in twelve short sentences, and made it a duty to advocate it everywhere</span>
				<span class='text'>Then the English hierarchy proceeded against him</span>
				<span class='text'>The chancellor of the University of Oxford had some of the declarations pronounced heretical</span>
				<span class='text'>When this was announced to Wycliffe, he declared that no one could change his convictions</span>
				<span class='text'>He then appealed – not to the pope nor to the ecclesiastical authorities of the land, but to the king</span>
				<span class='text'>He published his great confession upon the subject and also a second writing in English intended for the common people</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole paragraph, including purported quotation|date=August 2011}}As long as Wycliffe limited his attacks to abuses and the wealth of the Church, he could rely on the support of part of the clergy and aristocracy, but once he dismissed the traditional doctrine of [[transubstantiation]], his theses could not be defended any more</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Conti/&gt; This view cost him the support of John of Gaunt and many others</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Kiefer/&gt;In the midst of this came the [[English peasants' revolt of 1381|Peasants' Revolt of 1381]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Wycliffe disapproved of the revolt, some of his disciples justified the killing of Simon Sudbury, Archbishop of Canterbury</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1382 Wycliffe's old enemy [[William Courtenay]], now Archbishop of Canterbury, called an ecclesiastical assembly of notables at London</span>
				<span class='text'>During the consultations on 21 May an earthquake occurred; the participants were terrified and wished to break up the assembly, but Courtenay declared the earthquake a favourable sign which meant the purification of the earth from erroneous doctrine, and the result of the &quot;[[Earthquake Synod]]&quot; was assured</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole paragraph|date=August 2011}}Of the 24 propositions attributed to Wycliffe without mentioning his name, ten were declared heretical and fourteen erroneous</span>
				<span class='text'>The former had reference to the transformation in the sacrament, the latter to matters of church order and institutions</span>
				<span class='text'>It was forbidden from that time to hold these opinions or to advance them in sermons or in academic discussions</span>
				<span class='text'>All persons disregarding this order were to be subject to prosecution</span>
				<span class='text'>To accomplish this the help of the State was necessary; but the Commons rejected the bill</span>
				<span class='text'>The king, however, had a decree issued which permitted the arrest of those in error</span>
				<span class='text'>The citadel of the reformatory movement was Oxford, where Wycliffe's most active helpers were; these were laid under the ban and summoned to recant, and Nicholas of Hereford went to Rome to appeal</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole paragraph|date=August 2011}}On 17 November 1382, Wycliffe was summoned before a synod at Oxford</span>
				<span class='text'>He still commanded the favour of the court and of Parliament, to which he addressed a memorial</span>
				<span class='text'>He was neither excommunicated then, nor deprived of his living</span>
				<span class='text'>ycliffe aimed to do away with the existing hierarchy and replace it with the &quot;poor priests&quot; who lived in poverty, were bound by no vows, had received no formal [[consecration]], and preached the [[Gospel]] to the people</span>
				<span class='text'>Itinerant preachers spread the teachings of Wycliffe</span>
				<span class='text'>The bull of Gregory XI impressed upon them the name of [[Lollards]], intended as an opprobrious epithet, but it became, to them, a name of honour</span>
				<span class='text'>Even in Wycliffe's time the &quot;Lollards&quot; had reached wide circles in England and preached &quot;God's law, without which no one could be justified</span>

				<span class='text'>[[Henry Knighton]] says that in philosophy he was second to none, and in scholastic discipline incomparable</span>
				<span class='text'>There was a period in his life when he devoted himself exclusively to scholastic philosophy: &quot;when I was still a logician,&quot; he used later to say</span>
				<span class='text'>The first &quot;heresy&quot; which &quot;he cast forth into the world&quot; rests as much upon philosophical as upon theological grounds</span>
				<span class='text'>n [[Plato]], knowledge of whom came to Wycliffe through [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]], he saw traces of a knowledge of the [[Trinity]], and he championed the doctrine of ideas as against [[Aristotle]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He said that [[Democritus]], Plato, Augustine, and [[Grosseteste]] far outranked Aristotle</span>
				<span class='text'>In Aristotle he missed the provision for the [[Soul (spirit)|immortality of the soul]], and in his [[ethics]] the tendency toward the [[eternity|eternal]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a close follower of Augustine, so much so that he was called &quot;John of Augustine&quot; by his pupils</span>
				<span class='text'>In some of his teachings, as in ''De annihilatione'', the influence of [[Thomas Aquinas]] can be detected</span>
				<span class='text'>So far as his relations to the [[Medieval philosophy|philosophers of the Middle Ages]] are concerned, he held to [[Philosophical realism|realism]] as opposed to the [[nominalism]] advanced by [[William of Ockham|Occam]], although in questions that had to do with ecclesiastical politics he was related to Occam and indeed went beyond him</span>
				<span class='text'>His views are based upon the conviction of the reality of the universal, and he employed realism to avoid dogmatic difficulties</span>
				<span class='text'>he centre of Wycliffe's philosophical system is formed by the doctrine of the prior existence in the thought of God of all things and events</span>
				<span class='text'>This involves the definiteness of things and especially their number, so that neither their infinity, infinite extension, nor [[infinite divisibility]] can be assumed</span>
				<span class='text'>Space consists of a number of points of space determined from eternity, and time of exactly such a number of moments, and the number of these is known only to the divine spirit</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Geometry|Geometrical figures]] consist of arranged series of points, and enlargement or diminution of these figures rests upon the addition or subtraction of points</span>
				<span class='text'>Because the existence of these points of space as such, that is, as truly indivisible unities, has its basis in the fact that the points are one with the bodies that fill them; because, therefore, all possible space is coincident with the physical world (as in Wycliffe's system, in general, reality and possibility correspond), there can as little be a vacuum as bounding surfaces that are common to different bodies</span>
				<span class='text'>The assumption of such surfaces impinges, according to Wycliffe, upon the contradictory principle as does the conception of a truly continuous transition of one condition into another</span>
				<span class='text'>ycliffe's doctrine of [[atom]]s connects itself, therefore, with the doctrine of the composition of time from real moments, but is distinguished by the denial of interspaces as assumed in other systems</span>
				<span class='text'>From the identity of space and the physical world, and the circular motion of the heavens, Wycliffe deduces the [[sphere|spherical]] form of the universe</span>
				<span class='text'>= Attitude toward speculation ==Wycliffe's fundamental principle of the preexistence in thought of all reality involves the most serious obstacle to freedom of the will; the philosopher could assist himself only by the formula that the [[free will]] of man was something predetermined of God</span>
				<span class='text'>He demanded strict dialectical training as the means of distinguishing the true from the false, and asserted that logic (or the [[syllogism]]) furthered the knowledge of catholic verities; ignorance of logic was the reason why men misunderstood Scripture, since men overlooked the connection, the distinction between idea and appearance</span>
				<span class='text'>ycliffe was not merely conscious of the distinction between theology and philosophy, but his sense of reality led him to pass by scholastic questions</span>
				<span class='text'>He left aside philosophical discussions that seemed to have no significance for the religious consciousness and those that pertained purely to [[scholasticism]]: &quot;We concern ourselves with the verities that are, and leave aside the errors which arise from speculation on matters which are not</span>
