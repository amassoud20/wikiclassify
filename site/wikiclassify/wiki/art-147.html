				<span class='text'>Husserl's thought profoundly influenced the landscape of [[20th-century philosophy|twentieth-century philosophy]] and he remains a notable figure in contemporary philosophy and beyond</span>
				<span class='text'>Husserl studied mathematics under [[Karl Weierstrass]] and [[Leo Königsberger]], and philosophy under [[Franz Brentano]] and [[Carl Stumpf]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He taught philosophy as a ''Privatdozent'' at [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg|Halle]] from 1887, then as professor, first at [[Georg-August University of Göttingen|Göttingen]] from 1901, then at [[Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg|Freiburg]] from 1916 until he retired in 1928, after which he remained highly productive</span>
				<span class='text'>Following an illness, he died at [[Freiburg im Breisgau|Freiburg]] in 1938</span>

				<span class='text'>He was born into a Jewish family, the second of four children (boy, boy, girl, boy)</span>
				<span class='text'>His father was a [[milliner]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His childhood was spent in Prostějov, where he attended the elementary school</span>

				<span class='text'>At Leipzig he was inspired by philosophy lectures given by [[Wilhelm Wundt]], one of the founders of modern psychology</span>
				<span class='text'>Then he moved to the [[Frederick William University]] of Berlin in 1878 where he continued his study of mathematics under [[Leopold Kronecker]] and the renowned [[Karl Weierstrass]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In Berlin he found a mentor in [[Thomas Masaryk]], then a former philosophy student of [[Franz Brentano]] and later the first president of Czechoslovakia</span>
				<span class='text'>There Husserl also attended [[Friedrich Paulsen]]'s philosophy lectures</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1881 he left for the [[University of Vienna]] to complete his mathematics studies under the supervision of [[Leo Königsberger]] (a former student of Weierstrass)</span>
				<span class='text'>At Vienna in 1883 he obtained his Ph</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;KockelmansBiographical&quot;/&gt;Evidently as a result of his becoming familiar with the [[New Testament]] during his twenties, he asked to be baptized into the [[Lutheran Church]] in 1886</span>
				<span class='text'>Husserl's father Adolf had died in 1884</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Herbert Spiegelberg]] writes, &quot;While outward religious practice never entered his life any more than it did that of most academic scholars of the time, his mind remained open for the religious phenomenon as for any other genuine experience</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; At times Husserl saw his goal as one of moral &quot;renewal&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Although a steadfast proponent of a radical and rational ''autonomy'' in all things, Husserl could also speak &quot;about his vocation and even about his mission under God's will to find new ways for philosophy and science,&quot; observes Spiegelberg</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Following his [[doctorate]] in mathematics, he returned to Berlin to work as the assistant to [[Karl Weierstrass]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet already Husserl had felt the desire to pursue philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>Then professor Weierstrass became very ill</span>
				<span class='text'>Husserl became free to return to Vienna where, after serving a short military duty, he devoted his attention to [[philosophy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1884 at the [[University of Vienna]] he attended the lectures of [[Franz Brentano]] on philosophy and philosophical [[psychology]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Brentano introduced him to the writings of [[Bernard Bolzano]], [[Hermann Lotze]], [[John Stuart Mill|J</span>
				<span class='text'>Stuart Mill]], and [[David Hume]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Husserl was so impressed by Brentano that he decided to dedicate his life to philosophy; indeed, Franz Brentano is often credited as being his most important influence, e</span>

				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Following academic advice, two years later in 1886 Husserl followed [[Carl Stumpf]], a former student of Brentano, to the [[University of Halle]], seeking to obtain his [[Habilitation]] which would qualify him to teach at the university level</span>
				<span class='text'>There, under Stumpf's supervision, he wrote ''Über den Begriff der Zahl'' (''On the Concept of Number'') in 1887, which would serve later as the basis for his first important work, ''[[Philosophy of Arithmetic|Philosophie der Arithmetik]]'' (1891)</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In 1901 Husserl with his family moved to the [[Georg-August University of Göttingen]] where he taught as ''extraordinarius professor''</span>
				<span class='text'>Just prior to this a major work of his, ''Logische Untersuchungen'' (Halle 1900–1901), was published</span>
				<span class='text'>Volume One contains seasoned reflections on &quot;pure logic&quot; in which he carefully refutes &quot;psychologism&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Husserl's ''Logische'', in its disentangling of psychology from logic, also served as preparation for the later development of his work in [[phenomenological reduction]]</span>

				<span class='text'> [[Paul Ricœur]], ''Husserl</span>
				<span class='text'>An Analysis of His Phenomenology'' (Northwestern University 1967) at 29–30</span>
				<span class='text'>Ricœur traces Husserl's development from the ''Logische Untersuchungen'' to his later ''Ideen'' (1913), as leading from the psychological to the transcendental, regarding the intuition of essences (which the methodology of the [[phenomenological reduction]] allows)</span>
				<span class='text'>The book ''Husserl'' contains translations of Ricœur's essays of 1949–1967</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This work was well received and became the subject of a seminar given by [[Wilhelm Dilthey]]; Husserl in 1905 traveled to Berlin to visit Dilthey</span>
				<span class='text'>Two years later in Italy he paid a visit to Franz Brentano his inspiring old teacher and to [[Constantin Carathéodory]] the mathematician</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[René Descartes|Descartes]] were also now influencing his thought</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1910 he became joint editor of the journal ''Logos''</span>
				<span class='text'>During this period Husserl had delivered lectures on ''internal time consciousness'', which several decades later his former student Heidegger edited for publication</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Husserl, ''Vorlesungen zur Phänomenologie des inneren Zeitbewusstseins'' (1928), translated as ''The Phenomenology of Internal Time Consciousness'' (Indiana University 1964)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In 1912 at Freiburg the journal ''Jahrbuch für Philosophie und Phänomenologische Forschung'' (&quot;Yearbook for Philosophy and Phenomenological Research&quot;) was founded by Husserl and his school, and which published articles of their phenomenological movement from 1913 to 1930</span>
				<span class='text'>His important work ''Ideen''&lt;ref&gt;Husserl, ''Ideen au einer reinen Phänomenologie und phänomenologischen Philosophie'' (1913), translated as ''Ideas</span>
				<span class='text'>General Introduction to Pure Phenomenology'' (New York: Macmillan 1931; reprint Collier), with &quot;Author's Preface to the English Edition&quot; at 5–22</span>
				<span class='text'>Therein, Husserl in 1931 refers to &quot;Transcendental Subjectivity&quot; being &quot;a new field of experience&quot; opened as a result of practicing [[phenomenological reduction]], and giving rise to an ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' science not empirically based but somewhat similar to mathematics</span>
				<span class='text'>By such practice the individual becomes the &quot;transcendental Ego&quot;, although Husserl acknowledges the problem of [[solipsism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Later he emphasizes &quot;the necessary stressing of the difference between transcendental and psychological subjectivity, the repeated declaration that transcendental phenomenology is not in any sense psychology</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>&quot; but rather (in contrast to naturalistic psychology) by the phenomenological reduction &quot;the life of the soul is made intelligible in its most intimate and originally instuitional essence&quot; and whereby &quot;objects of the most varied grades right up to the level of the objective world are there for the Ego</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; was published in its first issue</span>
				<span class='text'>Before beginning ''Ideen'' Husserl's thought had reached the stage where &quot;each subject is 'presented' to itself, and to each all others are 'presentiated' (''Vergegenwärtigung''), not as parts of nature but as pure consciousness</span>

				<span class='text'>In his &quot;''Ideen'' period&quot; (1911–1925) Husserl also produced two unpublished manuscripts later referred to as ''Ideen II'' and ''Ideen III''</span>
				<span class='text'>Ricœur (1967) at 35</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; ''Ideen'' advanced his transition to a &quot;transcendental interpretation&quot; of phenomenology, a view later criticized by, among others, [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Sartre's &quot;disagreement with Husserl seems to have facilitated the transition from phenomenology to the existentialist doctrines of ''[[Being and Nothingness|L'Être et le Néant]]'' [1943]</span>

				<span class='text'>quot; As phenomenology further evolves, it leads (when viewed from another vantage point in Husserl's 'labyrinth') to &quot;transcendental subjectivity&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'> From within this sphere, which Husserl enacts in order to show the impossibility of solipsism, the transcendental [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] finds itself always already paired with the lived body of another ego, another monad</span>
				<span class='text'> This '[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]' interconnection of bodies, given in perception, is what founds the interconnection of consciousnesses known as transcendental intersubjectivity, which Husserl would go on to describe at length in volumes of unpublished writings</span>
				<span class='text'> There has been a debate over whether or not Husserl's description of ownness and its movement into intersubjectivity is sufficient to reject the charge of solipsism, to which Descartes, for example, was subject</span>
				<span class='text'> One argument against Husserl's description works this way: instead of infinity and the Deity being the ego's gateway to the Other, as in Descartes, Husserl's ego in the ''Cartesian Meditations'' itself becomes transcendent</span>
				<span class='text'>It remains, however, alone (unconnected)</span>
				<span class='text'>Only the ego's grasp &quot;by analogy&quot; of the Other (e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> by conjectural reciprocity) allows the possibility for an 'objective' intersubjectivity, and hence for community</span>

				<span class='text'> above footnote to ''Die Krisis'' (1936)</span>

				<span class='text'>In the summer of 1929 Husserl had studied carefully selected writings of Heidegger, coming to the conclusion that on several of their key positions they differed, e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> Heidegger substituted ''Dasein'' [&quot;Being-there&quot;] for the pure ego, thus transforming phenomenology into an anthropology, a type of psychologism strongly disfavored by Husserl</span>
				<span class='text'>Such observations of Heidegger, along with a critique of [[Max Scheler]], were put into a lecture Husserl gave to various ''Kant Societies'' in Frankfurt, Berlin, and Halle during 1931 entitled ''Phänomenologie und Anthropologie''</span>

				<span class='text'>His widow Malvine Husserl was instrumental in this rescue project; she became a convert to Catholicism in 1941</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Development of his thought=====Several early themes===In his first works Husserl tries to combine mathematics, psychology and philosophy with a main goal to provide a sound foundation for mathematics</span>
				<span class='text'>He analyzes the psychological process needed to obtain the concept of number and then tries to build up a systematical theory on this analysis</span>
				<span class='text'>To achieve this he uses several methods and concepts taken from his teachers</span>
				<span class='text'>From Weierstrass he derives the idea that we generate the concept of number by counting a certain collection of objects</span>
				<span class='text'>rom Brentano and Stumpf he takes over the distinction between ''proper'' and ''improper'' presenting</span>
				<span class='text'>In an example Husserl explains this in the following way: if you are standing in front of a house, you have a proper, direct presentation of that house, but if you are looking for it and ask for directions, then these directions (e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>the house on the corner of this and that street) are an indirect, improper presentation</span>
				<span class='text'>In other words, you can have a proper presentation of an object if it is actually present, and an improper (or symbolic as he also calls it) if you only can indicate that object through signs, symbols, etc</span>
				<span class='text'>Husserl's ''[[Logical Investigations (Husserl)|Logical Investigations]]'' (1900–1901) is considered the starting point for the formal theory of wholes and their parts known as [[mereology]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first=Peter | last=Simons | author-link=Peter Simons (professor) | title=Parts: A Study in Ontology | publisher=Oxford University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;Another important element that Husserl took over from Brentano is [[intentionality]], the notion that the main characteristic of [[consciousness]] is that it is always intentional</span>
				<span class='text'>While often simplistically summarised as &quot;aboutness&quot; or the relationship between mental acts and the external world, Brentano defined it as the main characteristic of ''mental phenomena'', by which they could be distinguished from ''physical phenomena''</span>
				<span class='text'>Every mental phenomenon, every psychological act, has a content, is directed at an object (the ''[[intentional object]]'')</span>
				<span class='text'>Every belief, desire, etc</span>
				<span class='text'>has an object that it is about: the believed, the wanted</span>
				<span class='text'>Brentano used the expression &quot;intentional inexistence&quot; to indicate the status of the objects of thought in the mind</span>
				<span class='text'>The property of being intentional, of having an intentional object, was the key feature to distinguish mental phenomena and physical phenomena, because physical phenomena lack intentionality altogether</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=October 2013}}===The elaboration of phenomenology&lt;!--linked from 'Michel Henry'--&gt;===Some years after the 1900–1901 publication of his main work, the ''Logische Untersuchungen'' (''Logical Investigations''), Husserl made some key conceptual elaborations which led him to assert that in order to study the structure of consciousness, one would have to distinguish between the act of consciousness and the phenomena at which it is directed (the objects as intended)</span>
				<span class='text'>Knowledge of [[essence]]s would only be possible by &quot;[[bracketing (phenomenology)|bracketing]]&quot; all assumptions about the existence of an external world</span>
				<span class='text'>This procedure he called ''[[epoché]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>These new concepts prompted the publication of the ''Ideen'' (''Ideas'') in 1913, in which they were at first incorporated, and a plan for a second edition of the ''Logische Untersuchungen''</span>
				<span class='text'>rom the ''Ideen'' onward, Husserl concentrated on the ideal, essential structures of consciousness</span>
				<span class='text'>The metaphysical problem of establishing the reality of what we perceive, as distinct from the perceiving subject, was of little interest to Husserl in spite of his being a [[Transcendental idealism|transcendental idealist]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Husserl proposed that the world of objects and ways in which we direct ourselves toward and perceive those objects is normally conceived of in what he called the &quot;natural standpoint&quot;, which is characterized by a belief that objects exist distinct from the perceiving subject and exhibit properties that we see as emanating from them</span>
				<span class='text'>Husserl proposed a radical new phenomenological way of looking at objects by examining how we, in our many ways of being intentionally directed toward them, actually &quot;constitute&quot; them (to be distinguished from materially creating objects or objects merely being figments of the imagination); in the Phenomenological standpoint, the object ceases to be something simply &quot;external&quot; and ceases to be seen as providing indicators about what it is, and becomes a grouping of perceptual and functional aspects that imply one another under the idea of a particular object or &quot;type&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The notion of objects as real is not expelled by phenomenology, but &quot;bracketed&quot; as a way in which we regard objects{{emdash}}instead of a feature that inheres in an object's essence founded in the relation between the object and the perceiver</span>
				<span class='text'>In order to better understand the world of appearances and objects, phenomenology attempts to identify the invariant features of how objects are perceived and pushes attributions of reality into their role as an attribution about the things we perceive (or an assumption underlying how we perceive objects)</span>
				<span class='text'>The major dividing line in Husserl's thought is the turn to transcendental idealism</span>

				<span class='text'>Husserl tries new methods of bringing his readers to understand the importance of [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] to scientific inquiry (and specifically to [[psychology]]) and what it means to &quot;bracket&quot; the natural attitude</span>
				<span class='text'>''The Crisis of the European Sciences'' is Husserl's unfinished work that deals most directly with these issues</span>
				<span class='text'>In it, Husserl for the first time attempts a historical overview of the development of [[Western philosophy]] and [[science]], emphasizing the challenges presented by their increasingly (one-sidedly) [[empirical]] and [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] orientation</span>
				<span class='text'>Husserl declares that mental and spiritual reality possess their own reality independent of any physical basis,&lt;ref&gt;This assumption led Husserl to an idealistic position (which he originally had tried to overcome or avoid)</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Husserl, ''Ideas'' 194</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In Husserl's work, consciousness of any given thing calls for discerning its meaning as an 'intentional object'</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Husserl, ''Ideas'' 242–43</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Such an object does not simply strike the senses, to be interpreted or misinterpreted by mental reason; it has already been selected and grasped, grasping being an etymological connotation, of ''percipere'', the root of 'perceive</span>

				<span class='text'>The German ''begreifen'', cognate with English 'grip,' carries the same sense</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Meaning and object===From ''Logical Investigations'' (1900/1901) to ''Experience and Judgment'' (published in 1939), Husserl expressed clearly the difference between [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] and [[Object (philosophy)|object]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He identified several different kinds of names</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, there are names that have the role of properties that uniquely identify an object</span>
				<span class='text'>Each of these names expresses a meaning and designates the same object</span>
				<span class='text'>Examples of this are &quot;the victor in Jena&quot; and &quot;the loser in Waterloo&quot;, or &quot;the equilateral triangle&quot; and &quot;the equiangular triangle&quot;; in both cases, both names express different meanings, but designate the same object</span>
				<span class='text'>There are names which have no meaning, but have the role of designating an object: &quot;Aristotle&quot;, &quot;Socrates&quot;, and so on</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally, there are names which designate a variety of objects</span>
				<span class='text'>These are called &quot;universal names&quot;; their meaning is a &quot;[[concept]]&quot; and refers to a series of objects (the extension of the concept)</span>
				<span class='text'>The way we know sensible objects is called &quot;[[Noumenon|sensible intuition]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>usserl also identifies a series of &quot;formal words&quot; which are necessary to form [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentences]] and have no sensible correlates</span>
				<span class='text'>Examples of formal words are &quot;a&quot;, &quot;the&quot;, &quot;more than&quot;, &quot;over&quot;, &quot;under&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, &quot;group&quot;, and so on</span>
				<span class='text'>Every sentence must contain formal words to designate what Husserl calls &quot;formal categories&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>There are two kinds of categories: meaning categories and formal-[[ontological]] categories</span>
				<span class='text'>Meaning categories relate judgments; they include forms of [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunction]], [[Logical disjunction|disjunction]], [[Plural|forms of plural]], among others</span>
				<span class='text'>Formal-ontological categories relate objects and include notions such as set, [[Cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal number]], [[Ordinal number (linguistics)|ordinal number]], part and whole, relation, and so on</span>
				<span class='text'>The way we know these categories is through a faculty of understanding called &quot;categorial intuition&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>hrough sensible intuition our [[consciousness]] constitutes what Husserl calls a &quot;situation of affairs&quot; (''Sachlage'')</span>
				<span class='text'>It is a passive constitution where objects themselves are presented to us</span>
				<span class='text'>To this situation of affairs, through categorial intuition, we are able to constitute a &quot;state of affairs&quot; (''Sachverhalt'')</span>
				<span class='text'>One situation of affairs through objective acts of consciousness (acts of constituting categorially) can serve as the basis for constituting multiple states of affairs</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, suppose ''a'' and ''b'' are two sensible objects in a certain situation of affairs</span>
				<span class='text'>We can use it as basis to say, &quot;''a''&lt;''b''&quot; and &quot;''b''&gt;''a''&quot;, two judgments which designate the same state of affairs</span>
				<span class='text'>For Husserl a [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] has a [[proposition]] or [[judgment]] as its meaning, and refers to a state of affairs which has a situation of affairs as a reference base</span>
				<span class='text'>==Philosophy of logic and mathematics===Husserl believed that ''truth-in-itself'' has as [[ontology|ontological]] correlate ''being-in-itself'', just as meaning categories have formal-ontological categories as correlates</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Logic]] is a formal theory of [[belief|judgment]], that studies the formal ''a priori'' relations among judgments using meaning categories</span>
				<span class='text'>Mathematics, on the other hand, is formal ontology; it studies all the possible forms of being (of objects)</span>
				<span class='text'>Hence for both logic and mathematics, the different formal categories are the objects of study, not the sensible objects themselves</span>
				<span class='text'>The problem with the psychological approach to mathematics and logic is that it fails to account for the fact that this approach is about formal categories, and not simply about abstractions from sensibility alone</span>
				<span class='text'>The reason why we do not deal with sensible objects in mathematics is because of another faculty of understanding called &quot;categorial abstraction</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Through this faculty we are able to get rid of sensible components of judgments, and just focus on formal categories themselves</span>
				<span class='text'>hanks to &quot;eidetic intuition&quot; (or &quot;essential intuition&quot;), we are able to grasp the possibility, impossibility, necessity and contingency among concepts and among formal categories</span>
				<span class='text'>Categorial intuition, along with categorial abstraction and eidetic intuition, are the basis for logical and mathematical knowledge</span>
				<span class='text'>usserl criticized the logicians of his day for not focusing on the relation between subjective processes that give us objective knowledge of pure logic</span>
				<span class='text'>All subjective activities of consciousness need an ideal correlate, and objective logic (constituted [[noema]]tically) as it is constituted by consciousness needs a noetic correlate (the subjective activities of consciousness)</span>
				<span class='text'>usserl stated that logic has three strata, each further away from consciousness and psychology than those that precede it</span>
				<span class='text'> The first stratum is what Husserl called a &quot;morphology of meanings&quot; concerning ''a priori'' ways to relate judgments to make them meaningful</span>
				<span class='text'>In this stratum we elaborate a &quot;pure grammar&quot; or a logical syntax, and he would call its rules &quot;laws to prevent non-sense&quot;, which would be similar to what logic calls today &quot;[[formal language|formation rules]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Mathematics, as logic's ontological correlate, also has a similar stratum, a &quot;morphology of formal-ontological categories&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'> The second stratum would be called by Husserl &quot;logic of consequence&quot; or the &quot;logic of non-contradiction&quot; which explores all possible forms of true judgments</span>
				<span class='text'>He includes here syllogistic classic logic, propositional logic and that of predicates</span>
				<span class='text'>This is a semantic stratum, and the rules of this stratum would be the &quot;laws to avoid counter-sense&quot; or &quot;laws to prevent contradiction&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>They are very similar to today's logic &quot;[[formal language|transformation rules]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Mathematics also has a similar stratum which is based among others on pure theory of pluralities, and a pure theory of numbers</span>
				<span class='text'>They provide a science of the conditions of possibility of any theory whatsoever</span>
				<span class='text'>Husserl also talked about what he called &quot;logic of truth&quot; which consists of the formal laws of possible truth and its modalities, and precedes the third logical third stratum</span>
				<span class='text'> The third stratum is [[metalogic]]al, what he called a &quot;theory of all possible forms of theories</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; It explores all possible theories in an ''a priori'' fashion, rather than the possibility of theory in general</span>
				<span class='text'>We could establish theories of possible relations between pure forms of theories, investigate these logical relations and the deductions from such general connection</span>
				<span class='text'>The logician is free to see the extension of this deductive, theoretical sphere of pure logic</span>
				<span class='text'>he ontological correlate to the third stratum is the &quot;[[manifolds|theory of manifolds]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>In formal ontology, it is a free investigation where a mathematician can assign several meanings to several symbols, and all their possible valid deductions in a general and indeterminate manner</span>
				<span class='text'>It is, properly speaking, the most universal mathematics of all</span>
				<span class='text'>Through the posit of certain indeterminate objects (formal-ontological categories) as well as any combination of mathematical axioms, mathematicians can explore the [[Apodicticity|apodeictic]] connections between them, as long as consistency is preserved</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to Husserl, this view of logic and mathematics accounted for the objectivity of a series of mathematical developments of his time, such as ''n''-dimensional [[manifold]]s (both [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean]] and [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean]]), [[Hermann Grassmann]]'s [[exterior algebra|theory of extension]]s, [[William Rowan Hamilton]]'s [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]s, [[Sophus Lie]]'s theory of [[transformation groups]], and [[Georg Cantor|Cantor's]] [[set theory]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[Jacob Klein (philosopher)|Jacob Klein]] was one student of Husserl who pursued this line of inquiry, seeking to &quot;desedimentize&quot; mathematics and the mathematical sciences</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See especially Klein's ''Greek Mathematical Thought and the Origin of Algebra'' (MIT Press, 1968)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Husserl and psychologism=====Philosophy of arithmetic and Frege===After obtaining his PhD in mathematics, Husserl began analyzing the [[foundations of mathematics]] from a psychological point of view</span>
				<span class='text'>In his professorial doctoral dissertation, ''On the Concept of Number'' (1886) and in his ''[[Philosophy of Arithmetic (book)|Philosophy of Arithmetic]]'' (1891), Husserl sought, by employing Brentano's descriptive psychology, to define the [[natural number]]s in a way that advanced the methods and techniques of [[Karl Weierstrass]], [[Richard Dedekind]], [[Georg Cantor]], [[Gottlob Frege]], and other contemporary mathematicians</span>
				<span class='text'>Later, in the first volume of his ''Logical Investigations'', the ''Prolegomena of Pure Logic'', Husserl, while attacking the psychologistic point of view in logic and mathematics, also appears to reject much of his early work, although the forms of psychologism analysed and refuted in the ''Prolegomena'' did not apply directly to his ''Philosophy of Arithmetic''</span>
				<span class='text'>Some scholars question whether Frege's negative review of the ''Philosophy of Arithmetic'' helped turn Husserl towards [[Platonism]], but he had already discovered the work of [[Bernhard Bolzano]] independently around 1890/91 and explicitly mentioned [[Bernard Bolzano]], [[Gottfried Leibniz]] and [[Hermann Lotze]] as inspirations for his newer position</span>
				<span class='text'>usserl's review of [[Ernst Schröder]], published before Frege's landmark 1892 article, clearly distinguishes [[sense]] from [[reference]]; thus Husserl's notions of [[noema]] and object also arose independently</span>
				<span class='text'>Likewise, in his criticism of Frege in the ''Philosophy of Arithmetic'', Husserl remarks on the distinction between the content and the extension of a concept</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, the distinction between the subjective mental act, namely the content of a concept, and the (external) object, was developed independently by [[School of Brentano|Brentano and his school]], and may have surfaced as early as Brentano's 1870's lectures on logic</span>
				<span class='text'>cholars such as [[Jitendra Nath Mohanty|J</span>
				<span class='text'>N</span>
				<span class='text'>Mohanty]], [[Claire Ortiz Hill]], and [[Guillermo E</span>
				<span class='text'>Rosado Haddock]], among others, have argued that Husserl's so-called change from [[psychologism]] to [[Platonism]] came about independently of Frege's review</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;For example, the review falsely accuses Husserl of subjectivizing everything, so that no objectivity is possible, and falsely attributes to him a notion of [[abstraction]] whereby objects disappear until we are left with numbers as mere ghosts</span>
				<span class='text'>Contrary to what Frege states, in Husserl's ''Philosophy of Arithmetic'' we already find two different kinds of representations: subjective and objective</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, objectivity is clearly defined in that work</span>
				<span class='text'>Frege's attack seems to be directed at certain foundational doctrines then current in Weierstrass's Berlin School, of which Husserl and Cantor cannot be said to be orthodox representatives</span>
				<span class='text'>urthermore, various sources indicate that Husserl changed his mind about psychologism as early as 1890, a year before he published the ''Philosophy of Arithmetic''</span>
				<span class='text'>Husserl stated that by the time he published that book, he had already changed his mind—that he had doubts about psychologism from the very outset</span>
				<span class='text'>He attributed this change of mind to his reading of Leibniz, Bolzano, Lotze, and [[David Hume]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Husserl-Chronik'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>25-26&lt;/ref&gt; Husserl makes no mention of Frege as a decisive factor in this change</span>
				<span class='text'>In his ''Logical Investigations'', Husserl mentions Frege only twice, once in a footnote to point out that he had retracted three pages of his criticism of Frege's ''The Foundations of Arithmetic'', and again to question Frege's use of the word ''Bedeutung'' to designate &quot;reference&quot; rather than &quot;meaning&quot; (sense)</span>
				<span class='text'>n a letter dated 24 May 1891, Frege thanked Husserl for sending him a copy of the ''Philosophy of Arithmetic'' and Husserl's review of [[Ernst Schröder]]'s ''Vorlesungen über die Algebra der Logik''</span>
				<span class='text'>In the same letter, Frege used the review of Schröder's book to analyze Husserl's notion of the sense of reference of concept words</span>
				<span class='text'>Hence Frege recognized, as early as 1891, that Husserl distinguished between sense and reference</span>
				<span class='text'>Consequently, Frege and Husserl independently elaborated a theory of sense and reference before 1891</span>
				<span class='text'>ommentators argue that Husserl's notion of [[noema]] has nothing to do with Frege's notion of sense, because ''noemata'' are necessarily fused with [[noesis|noeses]] which are the conscious activities of consciousness</span>
				<span class='text'>''Noemata'' have three different levels:* The substratum, which is never presented to the consciousness, and is the support of all the properties of the object;* The ''noematic'' senses, which are the different ways the objects are presented to us;* The [[Modal logic|modalities]] of being (possible, doubtful, existent, non-existent, absurd, and so on)</span>
				<span class='text'>onsequently, in intentional activities, even non-existent objects can be constituted, and form part of the whole noema</span>
				<span class='text'>Frege, however, did not conceive of objects as forming parts of senses: If a proper name denotes a non-existent object, it does not have a reference, hence concepts with no objects have no [[truth value]] in arguments</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, Husserl did not maintain that predicates of sentences designate concepts</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Frege the reference of a sentence is a truth value; for Husserl it is a &quot;state of affairs</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Frege's notion of &quot;sense&quot; is unrelated to Husserl's noema, while the latter's notions of &quot;meaning&quot; and &quot;object&quot; differ from those of Frege</span>
				<span class='text'>n detail, Husserl's conception of logic and mathematics differs from that of Frege, who held that [[arithmetic]] could be derived from logic</span>
				<span class='text'>For Husserl this is not the case: mathematics (with the exception of [[geometry]]) is the [[ontological correlate]] of logic, and while both fields are related, neither one is strictly reducible to the other</span>
				<span class='text'>==Husserl's criticism of psychologism===Reacting against authors such as [[John Stuart Mill|J</span>
				<span class='text'>S</span>
				<span class='text'>Mill]], [[Christoph von Sigwart]] and his own former teacher Brentano, Husserl criticised their psychologism in mathematics and logic, i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>their conception of these abstract and ''a priori'' sciences as having an essentially empirical foundation and a prescriptive or descriptive nature</span>
				<span class='text'>According to [[psychologism]], logic would not be an autonomous discipline, but a branch of psychology, either proposing a prescriptive and practical &quot;art&quot; of correct judgement (as Brentano and some of his more orthodox students did)&lt;ref&gt;See the quotes in Carlo Ierna, “Husserl’s Critique of Double Judgments”, in: Filip Mattens, editor, ''Meaning and Language: Phenomenological Perspectives'', Phaenomenologica 187 (Dordrecht/Boston/London: Springer, 2008, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>50 f</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; or a description of the factual processes of human thought</span>
				<span class='text'>Husserl pointed out that the failure of [[Anti-psychologism|anti-psychologists]] to defeat psychologism was a result of being unable to distinguish between the foundational, theoretical side of logic, and the applied, practical side</span>
				<span class='text'>Pure logic does not deal at all with &quot;thoughts&quot; or &quot;judgings&quot; as mental episodes but about ''a priori'' laws and conditions for any theory and any judgments whatsoever, conceived as propositions in themselves</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Here ‘Judgement’ has the same meaning as ‘proposition’, understood, not as a grammatical, but as an ideal unity of meaning</span>
				<span class='text'>This is the case with all the distinctions of acts or forms of judgement, which provide the foundations for the laws of pure logic</span>
				<span class='text'>Categorial, hypothetical, disjunctive, existential judgements, and however else we may call them, in pure logic are not names for classes of judgements, but for ideal forms of propositions</span>

				<span class='text'>112</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Since &quot;truth-in-itself&quot; has &quot;being-in-itself&quot; as ontological correlate, and since psychologists reduce truth (and hence logic) to empirical psychology, the inevitable consequence is scepticism</span>
				<span class='text'>Psychologists have also not been successful in showing how from [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] or psychological processes we can justify the absolute certainty of logical principles, such as the principles of identity and non-contradiction</span>
				<span class='text'>It is therefore futile to base certain logical laws and principles on uncertain processes of the mind</span>
				<span class='text'>his confusion made by psychologism (and related disciplines such as [[Biological determinism|biologism]] and anthropologism) can be due to three specific prejudices:1</span>
				<span class='text'>The first prejudice is the supposition that logic is somehow normative in nature</span>
				<span class='text'>Husserl argues that logic is theoretical, i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> that logic itself proposes ''a priori'' laws which are themselves the basis of the normative side of logic</span>
				<span class='text'>Since mathematics is related to logic, he cites an example from mathematics: If we have a formula like &quot;(a + b)(a – b) = a² – b²&quot; it does not tell us how to think mathematically</span>
				<span class='text'>It just expresses a truth</span>
				<span class='text'>A proposition that says: &quot;The product of the sum and the difference of a and b ''should'' give us the difference of the squares of a and b&quot; does express a normative proposition, but this normative statement ''is based on'' the theoretical statement &quot;(a + b)(a – b) = a² – b²&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>For psychologists, the acts of judging, [[reason]]ing, deriving, and so on, are all psychological processes</span>
				<span class='text'>Therefore, it is the role of psychology to provide the foundation of these processes</span>
				<span class='text'>Husserl states that this effort made by psychologists is a &quot;metábasis eis állo génos&quot; ([[Ancient Greek|Gr</span>
				<span class='text'>] μετάβασις εἰς ἄλλο γένος, &quot;a transgression to another field&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} It is a metábasis because psychology cannot possibly provide any foundations for ''a priori'' laws which themselves are the basis for all the ways we should think correctly</span>
				<span class='text'>Psychologists have the problem of confusing intentional activities with the object of these activities</span>
				<span class='text'>It is important to distinguish between the act of judging and the judgment itself, the act of counting and the number itself, and so on</span>
				<span class='text'>Counting five objects is undeniably a psychological process, but the number 5 is not</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Judgments can be true or not true</span>
				<span class='text'>Psychologists argue that judgments are true because they become &quot;evidently&quot; true to us</span>
				<span class='text'>This evidence, a psychological process that &quot;guarantees&quot; truth, is indeed a psychological process</span>
				<span class='text'>Husserl responds by saying that truth itself as well as logical laws always remain valid regardless of psychological &quot;evidence&quot; that they are true</span>
				<span class='text'>No psychological process can explain the ''a priori'' objectivity of these [[logical truth]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>rom this criticism to psychologism, the distinction between psychological acts and their intentional objects, and the difference between the normative side of logic and the theoretical side, derives from a [[Platonism|platonist]] conception of logic</span>
				<span class='text'>This means that we should regard logical and mathematical laws as being independent of the human mind, and also as an autonomy of meanings</span>
				<span class='text'>It is essentially the difference between the real (everything subject to time) and the ideal or irreal (everything that is atemporal), such as logical truths, mathematical entities, mathematical truths and meanings in general</span>

				<span class='text'>Husserl became increasingly critical of Heidegger's work, especially in 1929, and included pointed criticism of Heidegger in lectures he gave during 1931</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See above subsection &quot;Heidegger and the Nazi era&quot;</span>
