				<span class='text'>Grant''' (born '''Hiram Ulysses Grant'''; April 27, 1822 – July 23, 1885) was the [[List of Presidents of the United States|18th]] [[President of the United States]] (1869–77)</span>
				<span class='text'>As [[Commanding General of the United States Army|Commanding General]] (1864–69), Grant worked closely with President [[Abraham Lincoln]] to lead the [[Union Army]] to victory over the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] in the [[American Civil War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He implemented Congressional [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]], often at odds with Lincoln's successor, [[Andrew Johnson]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Twice elected president, Grant led the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republicans]] in their effort to remove the vestiges of Confederate nationalism and slavery, protect [[African American|African-American]] citizenship, and support economic prosperity nationwide</span>
				<span class='text'>His presidency has often come under criticism for protecting corrupt associates and in his second term leading the nation into a severe economic depression</span>
				<span class='text'>rant graduated in 1843 from the [[United States Military Academy|U</span>

				<span class='text'>He struggled financially in civilian life</span>
				<span class='text'>When the Civil War began in 1861, he rejoined the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Army</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1862, Grant took control of [[Kentucky in the American Civil War|Kentucky]] and most of [[Tennessee in the American Civil War|Tennessee]], and led Union forces to victory in the [[Battle of Shiloh]], earning a reputation as an aggressive commander</span>
				<span class='text'>He incorporated displaced African American slaves into the Union war effort</span>
				<span class='text'>In July 1863, after a series of coordinated battles, Grant defeated Confederate armies and seized [[Vicksburg Campaign|Vicksburg]], giving the Union control of the [[Mississippi River]] and dividing the Confederacy in two</span>
				<span class='text'>After his victories in the [[Chattanooga Campaign]], Lincoln promoted him to lieutenant-general and Commanding General of the United States in March 1864</span>
				<span class='text'>Grant confronted [[Robert E</span>
				<span class='text'>Lee]] in a series of bloody battles, trapping Lee's army in their [[Siege of Petersburg|defense of Richmond]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Grant coordinated a series of devastating campaigns in other theaters</span>
				<span class='text'>In April 1865, Lee surrendered to Grant at [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox]], effectively ending the war</span>
				<span class='text'>Historians have hailed Grant's military genius, and [[Ulysses S</span>
				<span class='text'>Grant and the American Civil War|his strategies]] are featured in military history textbooks, but a minority contend that he won by brute force rather than superior strategy</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Bonekemper 2004|pp=271–282}}After the Civil War, Grant led the army's supervision of Reconstruction in the former Confederate states</span>
				<span class='text'>Elected president in 1868 and reelected in 1872, Grant stabilized the nation during the turbulent Reconstruction period, prosecuted the [[Ku Klux Klan]], and enforced civil and voting rights laws using the army and the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He used the army to build the Republican Party in the South, based on black voters, Northern newcomers (&quot;[[carpetbaggers]]&quot;), and native Southern white supporters (&quot;[[scalawags]]&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>After the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Participants in rebellion|disenfranchisement of some former Confederates]], Republicans gained majorities and African Americans were elected to Congress and high state offices</span>
				<span class='text'> In his second term, the Republican coalitions in the South splintered and were defeated one by one as [[redeemers]] (conservative whites) regained control using coercion and violence</span>
				<span class='text'>Grant's Indian peace policy initially reduced frontier violence, but is best known for the [[Great Sioux War of 1876]], where [[George Custer]] and his regiment were killed at the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Throughout his presidency Grant was faced with charges of corruption in executive agencies, including congressional investigations of two cabinet secretaries</span>
				<span class='text'>In foreign policy, Grant sought to increase American trade and influence, while remaining at peace with the world</span>
				<span class='text'>His administration successfully resolved the [[Alabama Claims|''Alabama'' Claims]] by the [[Treaty of Washington (1871)|Treaty of Washington]] with Great Britain, ending wartime tensions</span>
				<span class='text'>Grant avoided war with Spain over the [[Virginius Affair]], but Congress rejected his attempted [[Annexation of Santo Domingo|annexation of the Dominican Republic]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In trade policy, Grant's administration implemented a [[gold standard]] and sought to strengthen the dollar</span>
				<span class='text'>Corruption charges escalated during his second term, while his response to the [[Panic of 1873]] proved ineffective nationally in halting the five-year industrial depression that produced high unemployment, low prices, low profits, and bankruptcies</span>
				<span class='text'>Grant left office in 1877 and embarked on a widely praised world tour lasting over two years</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1880, Grant was unsuccessful in obtaining a Republican presidential nomination for a third term</span>
				<span class='text'>Facing severe investment reversals and dying of throat cancer, he completed [[Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S</span>
				<span class='text'>Grant|his memoirs]], which proved a major critical and financial success</span>
				<span class='text'>His death in 1885 prompted an outpouring of national unity</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States|Historians' evaluations]] were negative about his presidency before recovering somewhat beginning in the 1980s</span>
				<span class='text'>Scholars rank his presidency below the average of other presidents</span>
				<span class='text'>Grant's critics take a negative view of his economic mismanagement and his failed Dominican Republic annexation treaty, while admirers emphasize his concern for [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and enforcement of civil and voting rights</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=32–33}} At [[Battle of Monterrey|Monterrey]] he demonstrated his equestrian ability, by volunteering to carry a dispatch through sniper-lined streets while hanging off the side of his horse, keeping the animal between him and the enemy</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Smith|pp=56–57}} President [[James K</span>
				<span class='text'>Polk]], wary of Taylor's growing popularity, divided his forces, sending some troops (including Grant's unit) to form a new army under Major General [[Winfield Scott]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=34–35}} Scott's army landed at [[Veracruz]] and advanced toward [[Mexico City]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The army met the Mexican forces at the battles of [[Battle of Molino del Rey|Molino del Rey]] and [[Battle of Chapultepec|Chapultepec]] outside Mexico City</span>
				<span class='text'>Grant was a quartermaster in charge of supplies and did not have a combat role, but he yearned for one and finally was allowed to take part in dangerous missions</span>
				<span class='text'>At Chapultepec, men under Grant's direction dragged a disassembled [[howitzer]] into a church steeple, reassembled it, and bombarded nearby Mexican troops</span>
				<span class='text'>His bravery and initiative earned him [[brevet (military)|brevet]] promotions; he became a temporary captain while his permanent rank was lieutenant</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Simpson|p=458}} In his ''Memoirs'', he wrote that this is how he learned about military leadership, and in retrospect identified his leadership style with Taylor's</span>
				<span class='text'>Even so, he believed that the Mexican war was wrongful and that the territorial gains from the war were designed to expand slavery</span>
				<span class='text'>Grant reflected in 1883, &quot;I was bitterly opposed to the measure, and to this day, regard the war, which resulted, as one of the most unjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Woodward|loc=''passim''}} Against the harsh public revelation of the [[Credit Mobilier of America scandal]], Grant faced charges of misconduct in nearly all federal departments, engaging his administration in constant conflict between corrupt associates and reformers</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|McFeely 1974|pp=133–134}} Although personally honest with his own money matters, Grant was trusting and had difficulty in spotting corruption in others</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnm|Smith||1p=592|McFeely 1981||2pp=407–415}} Stubbornly protective of corrupt associates, Grant often saw their prosecutions as unjust and shielded them from attack even at the cost of his own reputation, unless evidence of personal misconduct was overwhelming</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Smith|p=587}} No person linked any of the scandals together, except possibly Grant's personal secretary, [[Orville E</span>
				<span class='text'>Babcock]], who indirectly controlled many cabinet departments and delayed federal investigations</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|McFeely 1974|pp=133–134}}{{sfn|Woodward|loc=''passim''}}In Grant's second term, a congressional investigation exposed corruption in the Treasury Department, in a case that would become known as the [[Sanborn incident]]: Secretary [[William Adams Richardson|William Richardson]] had hired John Sanborn (a friend of Congressman Benjamin Butler) as an independent tax collector on a percentage basis, also known as a ''moiety''</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Smith|p=578}} Treasury officials were then privately instructed not to press for payment, so that accounts would eventually become delinquent in taxes and Sanborn would get paid more when he &quot;discovered&quot; the accounts' delinquency</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Smith|p=578}} The congressional committee report condemned Richardson for permitting the aggressive tax collection system Sanborn used, but did not attempt impeachment</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|McFeely 1974|pp=147–148}} To quell the public outcry and prevent future fraud, Congress passed the [[Anti-Moiety Acts|Anti-Moiety Act]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Signed into law by Grant in 1874, it abolished the moiety system</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|McFeely 1974|pp=133–134}}In 1874, on becoming Treasury Secretary, [[Benjamin H</span>
				<span class='text'>Bristow]] began a series of reforms</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Brands 2012a|pp=556–557}}{{sfn|Kohn|p=417}} Finding that millions of dollars in revenue were missing,{{sfn|Brands 2012a|pp=556–557}} and having gotten Grant's endorsement in advance (&quot;Let no guilty man escape&quot;), Bristow obtained 238 indictments</span>
				<span class='text'>These led to 110 convictions, and millions in tax dollars were restored to the Treasury</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Kohn|p=417}} When Bristow's investigation implicated Babcock as part of the Whiskey Ring, Grant became defensive, believing Babcock was the innocent victim of a witch hunt</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Smith|pp=591–593}} While denying immunity to minor Whiskey Ring conspirators, Grant worked to protect Babcock</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Kohn|p=417}} In 1876, Babcock was found not guilty at a trial in which Grant testified on his behalf through a deposition</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Kohn|p=417}} After the trial, under public pressure, Grant dismissed Babcock from the White House</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Smith|pp=591–593}}{{efn|McFeely, writing in 1981, believed that Grant knew of Babcock's guilt, while Smith, in 2001, believed the evidence against Babcock was circumstantial at best</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Kohn|p=417}}As the scandals increased, Congress, with the House now under Democratic control, began several investigations into corruption in the administration, the most notable of which dealt with [[trader post scandal|profiteering at western trading posts]]</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Brands 2012a|pp=560–561}} Congress also investigated and reprimanded Navy Secretary George M</span>
				<span class='text'>Robeson in 1876 for receiving bribes</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|McFeely 1974|p=153}}Grant's [[United States Civil Service Commission|Civil Service Commission]] reforms had limited success, as his cabinet implemented a merit system that increased the number of qualified candidates and relied less on Congressional patronage</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnm|Smith||1pp=589–590|Simon 2002||2p=250}} Interior Secretary [[Columbus Delano]], however, exempted his department from competitive examinations, and Congress refused to enact permanent Civil Service reform</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Smith|p=589}} [[Zachariah Chandler]], who succeeded Delano, cleaned up corruption in the Interior Department</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnm|Simon 2002||1p=250|Patrick||2p=172}} Grant appointed reformers Edwards Pierrepont and [[Marshall Jewell]] as Attorney General and Postmaster General, respectively, who supported Bristow's investigations</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnm|Smith||1pp=584–585|Hesseltine||2p=366}} In 1875, Pierrepont cleaned up corruption among the [[United States Attorney]]s and Marshals in the South</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Hesseltine|p=374}} Grant suggested other reforms as well, including a proposal that states should offer free [[State school|public schooling]] to all children; he also endorsed the [[Blaine Amendment]], which would have forbidden government aid to schools with religious affiliations</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Smith|pp=570–571}}===Election of 1876==={{main|United States presidential election, 1876}}Even as Grant drew cheers at the [[Centennial Exposition]] in 1876, the collected scandals of the last eight years, the country's weak economy, and the Democratic gains in the House led many in the Republican party to repudiate him</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnm|McFeely 1981||1pp=440–441|Patrick||2p=255}} Bristow was among the leading candidates to replace him, suggesting that a large faction desired an end to &quot;Grantism&quot; and feared that Grant would run for a third term</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=440–441}} Ultimately, Grant did not run, but Bristow was not the nominee either, as the convention settled on Governor [[Rutherford B</span>
				<span class='text'>Hayes]] of Ohio, a reformer</span>
				<span class='text'>The Democrats nominated Governor [[Samuel J</span>
				<span class='text'>Tilden]] of New York</span>
				<span class='text'>Voting irregularities in three Southern states caused the election that year to remain undecided for several months</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Smith|p=598}} Grant told Congress to settle the matter through legislation and assured both sides that he would not use the army to force a result, except to curb violence</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Smith|pp=601–603}} Congress formed an [[Electoral Commission (United States)|Electoral Commission]] to decide the matter</span>
				<span class='text'>The result was the [[Compromise of 1877]]: the Electoral Commission ruled that the disputed votes belonged to Hayes, but the last troops were withdrawn from Southern capitals</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=448–449}} The trip, which would last two years, began in [[Liverpool]] in May 1877, where enormous crowds greeted the ex-president and his entourage</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=454–455}} The Grants dined with [[Queen Victoria]] at [[Windsor Castle]], and Grant gave several speeches in London</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Brands 2012a|pp=581–583}} After a tour on the continent, the Grants spent a few months with their daughter Nellie, who had married an Englishman and moved to that country several years before</span>
				<span class='text'>Grant and his wife journeyed to France and Italy, spending Christmas 1877 aboard [[USS Vandalia (1876)|USS ''Vandalia'']], a warship docked in Palermo</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=460–465}} A winter sojourn in the Holy Land followed, and they visited Greece before returning to Italy and a meeting with [[Pope Leo XIII]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=466–467}} They toured Spain before moving on to Germany, where Grant discussed military matters with Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]], telling him that in the final stages of the Civil War, the Union Army fought to preserve the nation and to &quot;destroy slavery&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Brands 2012a|pp=585–586}}The Grants left from England by ship, sailing through the [[Suez Canal]] to India</span>
				<span class='text'>They visited cities throughout the [[British Raj|Raj]], welcomed by colonial officials</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=471–473}} After India, they toured [[Burma]], [[Siam]] (where Grant met with King [[Chulalongkorn]]), [[Singapore]], and [[Cochinchina]] (Vietnam)</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Brands 2012a|pp=590–591}} Traveling on to Hong Kong, Grant began to change his mind on the nature of colonization, believing that British rule was not &quot;purely selfish&quot; but also good for the colonial subjects</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=471–473}} Leaving Hong Kong, the Grants visited the cities of Canton, Shanghai, and Peking, China</span>
				<span class='text'>He declined to ask for an interview with the [[Guangxu Emperor]], a child of seven, but did speak with the head of government, [[Prince Gong (Qing dynasty)|Prince Gong]], and [[Li Hongzhang]], a leading general</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Brands 2012a|pp=591–592}} They discussed China's dispute with Japan over the [[Ryukyu Islands]], and Grant agreed to help bring the two sides to agreement</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Brands 2012a|pp=593–594}} After crossing over to Japan and meeting the [[Emperor Meiji]], Grant convinced China to accept the Japanese annexation of the islands, and the two nations avoided war</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Smith|pp=612n–613n}}By then, the Grants had been gone two years, and were homesick</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Smith|p=613}} After a visit to [[Yosemite National Park|Yosemite Valley]], they returned at last to Philadelphia on December 16, 1879</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=477}} The voyage around the world had captured popular imagination, and Republicans—especially those of the [[Stalwart (politics)|Stalwart]] faction excluded from the Hayes administration—saw Grant in a new light</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Brands 2012a|pp=600–601}} Even so, Conkling and [[John A</span>

				<span class='text'>When [[1880 Republican National Convention|the convention]] convened in Chicago in June, there were more delegates pledged to Grant than to any other candidate, but he was still short of a majority vote to capture the nomination</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Brands 2012a|pp=600–601}}At the convention, Conkling nominated Grant with an elegant speech, the most famous line being: &quot;When asked which state he hails from, our sole reply shall be, he hails from Appomattox and its famous apple tree</span>

				<span class='text'>After thirty-six ballots, Blaine's delegates deserted him and combined with those of other candidates to nominate a compromise candidate: Representative [[James A</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Brands 2012a|p=602}} The 306 votes Grant received on the last ballot was not enough to secure the nomination</span>
				<span class='text'>A procedural motion made the vote unanimous for Garfield, who accepted the nomination</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Smith|p=617}}Grant gave speeches for Garfield, but declined to criticize the Democratic nominee, [[Winfield Scott Hancock]], a general who had served under him in the Army of the Potomac</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Brands 2012a|pp=604–605}} Garfield won the popular vote by a narrow margin, but solidly won the Electoral College—214 to 155</span>
				<span class='text'>After the election, Grant gave Garfield his public support, and pushed him to include Stalwarts in his administration</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Brands 2012a|pp=607–609}}===Business ventures===Grant's world tour had been costly</span>
				<span class='text'>When he returned to America, Grant had depleted most of his savings and needed to earn money and find a new home</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Brands 2012a|p=611}} Wealthy friends bought him a home on Manhattan's [[Upper East Side]], and to make an income, Grant, Jay Gould, and former Mexican Finance Secretary [[Matías Romero]] chartered the Mexican Southern Railroad, with plans to build a railroad from Oaxaca to Mexico City</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=486–489}} Grant urged [[Chester A</span>
				<span class='text'>Arthur]], who had succeeded Garfield as president in 1881, to negotiate a free trade treaty with Mexico</span>
				<span class='text'>Arthur and the Mexican government agreed, but the United States Senate rejected the treaty in 1883</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=486–489}} The railroad was similarly unsuccessful, falling into bankruptcy the following year</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=486–489}}At the same time, Grant's son Ulysses Jr</span>
				<span class='text'>had opened a Wall Street brokerage house with [[Ferdinand Ward]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Regarded as a rising star, Ward, and the firm, Grant &amp; Ward, were initially successful</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=488–491}} In 1883, Grant joined the firm and invested $100,000 of his own money</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Brands 2012a|p=619}} Investors bought [[Security (finance)|securities]] through the firm, and Ward used the securities as collateral to borrow money to buy more securities</span>
				<span class='text'>Grant &amp; Ward pledged that collateral to borrow more money to trade in securities on the firm's own account</span>
				<span class='text'>The practice—called [[hypothecation]]—was legal and accepted; what was illegal was ''rehypothecation'', the practice of pledging the same securities as collateral for multiple loans</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=488–491}} Ward, having colluded with the bank involved, did this for many of the firm's assets</span>
				<span class='text'>When the trades went bad, multiple loans came due, all backed up by the same collateral</span>
				<span class='text'>Historians agree that Grant was likely unaware of Ward's tactics, but it is unclear how much Buck Grant knew</span>
				<span class='text'>In May 1884, enough investments went bad to convince Ward that the firm would soon be bankrupt</span>
				<span class='text'>Ward told Grant of the impending failure, but suggested that this was a temporary shortfall</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Brands 2012a|pp=620–621}} Grant approached businessman [[William Henry Vanderbilt]], who gave him a personal loan of $150,000</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=492–493}} Grant invested the money in the firm, but it was not enough to save the firm from failure</span>

				<span class='text'>The articles were well received by critics, and the editor, [[Robert Underwood Johnson]], suggested that Grant write a book of memoirs, as Sherman and others had done</span>
				<span class='text'>Grant's articles would serve as the basis for several chapters</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=494}}In the summer of 1884, Grant complained of a soreness in his throat, but put off seeing a doctor until late October where he finally learned it was [[Head and neck cancer|throat cancer]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Waugh|p=277}} Before being diagnosed, Grant was invited to a Methodist service for Civil War veterans in [[Ocean Grove, New Jersey]], on August 4, 1884, receiving a standing ovation from more than ten thousand veterans and others; it would be his last public appearance</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=495–496}} In March of the following year, the [[New York Times]] finally announced that Grant was dying of cancer{{sfn|Waugh|p=279}} and a nationwide public concern for the former president began</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Paxson &amp; Bach|p=500}}Views of Grant reached new lows as he was seen as an unsuccessful president and an unskilled, if lucky, general</span>

				<span class='text'>Harry Williams]] began the reassessment of Grant's military career in the 1960s, shifting the analysis of Grant as victor by brute force to that of successful and skillful strategist and commander</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Rafuse|p=851}} Even for scholars with a particular concern for the plight of former slaves and Indians, Grant left a problematic legacy and, with changing attitudes toward warfare after the end of the [[Vietnam War]], Grant's military reputation suffered again</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>But if Grant tried and failed, who could have succeeded?&quot;{{sfn|Simon 1982|p=221}} Simon praised Grant's first term in office, arguing that it should be &quot;remembered for his staunch enforcement of the rights of freedmen combined with conciliation of former Confederates, for reform in Indian policy and civil service, for successful negotiation of the ''Alabama'' Claims, and for delivery of peace and prosperity</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Simon 2002|p=253}} According to Simon, the Liberal Republican revolt, the Panic of 1873, and the North's conservative retreat from Reconstruction weakened Grant's second term in office, although his foreign policy remained steady</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Waugh|p=2}} Grant's reputation rose further with Jean Edward Smith's 2001 biography</span>
				<span class='text'>Smith argued that the same qualities that made Grant a success as a general carried over to his political life to make him, if not a successful president, then certainly an admirable one</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Weigley|p=1105}} Smith wrote that &quot;the common thread is strength of character—an indomitable will that never flagged in the face of adversity&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Sometimes he blundered badly; often he oversimplified; yet he saw his goals clearly and moved toward them relentlessly</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Smith|p=15}} [[Brooks Simpson]] continued the trend in the first of two volumes on Grant in 2000, although the work was far from a hagiography</span>

				<span class='text'>By the end of his public life the Union was more secure than at any previous time in the history of the nation</span>
				<span class='text'>And no one had done more to produce the result than he</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Brands 2012a|p=636}}}}As [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] scholar [[Eric Foner]] wrote, Brands gave &quot;a sympathetic account of Grant's forceful and temporarily successful effort as president to crush the Ku Klux Klan, which had inaugurated a reign of terror against the former slaves</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Foner adds that by 1875 Grant had given up rescuing the blacks, saying the public was tired of them, concluding that &quot;Grant's unwillingness to act reflected the broader Northern retreat from Reconstruction and its ideal of racial equality</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Foner 2012}}Besides civil rights, issues of environmental protection have also attracted historiographical attention</span>
				<span class='text'>Historian Joan Waugh, in her generally favorable book, says Grant appreciated the beauty of the West, and in 1872 signed the law establishing the country's first national park at [[Yellowstone]]</span>
				<span class='text'>However, she argues:{{blockquote|</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>the idea of preserving the region's environment and concerns about industrial pollution were of much less importance to Grant&amp;nbsp;</span>

				<span class='text'>{{sfn|Waugh|p=132}}}}Throughout the 20th century, historians ranked his presidency near the bottom</span>
