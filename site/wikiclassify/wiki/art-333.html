				<span class='text'>any basketball observers,{{who|date=October 2014}} in addition to Abdul-Jabbar, believe that Kareem's reticence, whether through disdain for the press corps or simply because of introversion, contributed to the dearth of coaching opportunities offered to Abdul-Jabbar by the NBA</span>

				<span class='text'>Combined with his long arms and great height, {{convert|7|ft|2|in|m}}, the skyhook was difficult for a defender to block without [[goaltending]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It was a reliable and feared offensive weapon and contributed to his high lifetime field goal percentage of 0</span>
				<span class='text'>59</span>
				<span class='text'>He was adept at shooting the skyhook with either hand, which made him even more difficult to defend against, though as a right-handed player, he was stronger shooting the skyhook with his right hand than he was with his left</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Abdul-Jabbar, he learned the move in fifth grade after practicing with the [[Mikan Drill]] and soon learned to value it, as it was &quot;the only shot I could use that didn't get smashed back in my face</span>
