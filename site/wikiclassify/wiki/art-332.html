				<span class='text'>In a career spanning over 50 years, Vonnegut published fourteen novels, three short story collections, five plays, and five works of non-fiction</span>
				<span class='text'>He is most famous for his darkly satirical, best-selling novel ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]'' (1969)</span>
				<span class='text'>orn and raised in [[Indianapolis]], Indiana, Vonnegut attended [[Cornell University]], but dropped out in January 1943 and enlisted in the [[United States Army]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was deployed to Europe to fight in World War II, and was captured by the Germans during the [[Battle of the Bulge]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was interned in [[Dresden]] and survived the Allied bombing of the city by taking refuge in a meat locker</span>
				<span class='text'>After the war, Vonnegut married Jane Marie Cox, with whom he had three children</span>
				<span class='text'>He later adopted his sister's three sons, after she died of cancer and her husband died in a train accident</span>
				<span class='text'>onnegut published his first novel, ''[[Player Piano (novel)|Player Piano]]'', in 1952</span>
				<span class='text'>The novel was reviewed positively, but was not commercially successful</span>
				<span class='text'>In the nearly twenty years that followed, Vonnegut published several novels that were only marginally successful, such as ''[[Cat's Cradle]]'' (1963) and ''[[God Bless You, Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Rosewater]]'' (1964)</span>
				<span class='text'>Vonnegut's ''[[magnum opus]]'', however, was his immediately successful sixth novel, ''Slaughterhouse-Five''</span>
				<span class='text'>The book's antiwar sentiment resonated with its readers amidst the ongoing [[Vietnam War]], and its reviews were generally positive</span>
				<span class='text'>After its release, ''Slaughterhouse-Five'' went to the top of [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]], thrusting Vonnegut into fame</span>
				<span class='text'>He was invited to give speeches, lectures, and [[commencement address]]es around the country and received many awards and honors</span>
				<span class='text'>ater in his career, Vonnegut published several autobiographical essay and short-story collections, including ''[[Fates Worse Than Death]]'' (1991), and ''[[A Man Without a Country]]'' (2005)</span>
				<span class='text'>After his death, he was hailed as a morbidly comical commentator on the society in which he lived, and as one of the most important contemporary writers</span>
				<span class='text'>Vonnegut's son [[Mark Vonnegut|Mark]] published a compilation of his father's unpublished compositions, titled ''[[Armageddon in Retrospect]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Numerous scholarly works were released, examining Vonnegut's writing and humor</span>
				<span class='text'>= Biography ===== Family and early life ===Kurt Vonnegut, Jr</span>
				<span class='text'> was born on November 11, 1922 in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was the youngest of three children of [[Kurt Vonnegut, Sr</span>
				<span class='text'>] and his wife Edith ({{nee}} Lieber)</span>
				<span class='text'>His older siblings were [[Bernard Vonnegut|Bernard]] (born 1914) and Alice (born 1917)</span>
				<span class='text'>Vonnegut was almost entirely descended from German immigrants who settled in the United States in the mid-19th century; his patrilineal great-grandfather, [[Clemens Vonnegut]] of [[Westphalia, Germany]], settled in Indianapolis and founded the [[Vonnegut Hardware Company]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Kurt's father, and his father before him, [[Bernard Vonnegut I|Bernard]], were architects; the architecture firm under Kurt, Sr</span>
				<span class='text'>designed such buildings as [[Athenæum (Das Deutsche Haus)|Das Deutsche Haus]] (now called &quot;The Athenæum&quot;), the Indiana headquarters of the [[Bell Telephone Company]], and the [[Fletcher Trust Building]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;BoomhowerFarrell4-5&quot; /&gt; Vonnegut's mother was born into Indianapolis high society, as her family, the Liebers, were among the wealthiest in the city, their fortune derived from ownership of a successful brewery</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=2}}Although both of Vonnegut's parents were fluent German speakers, the ill feeling toward that country during and after World War I caused the Vonneguts to abandon the culture to show their American patriotism</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, they never taught their youngest son German or introduced him to German literature and tradition, leaving him feeling &quot;ignorant and rootless&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>&quot;[She] gave me decent moral instruction and was exceedingly nice to me</span>
				<span class='text'>So she was as great an influence on me as anybody</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Vonnegut described Young as &quot;humane and wise&quot;, adding that &quot;the compassionate, forgiving aspects of [his] beliefs&quot; came from her</span>

				<span class='text'>The Liebers's brewery was closed in 1921 after the advent of [[Prohibition in the United States]]</span>
				<span class='text'>When the [[Great Depression]] hit, few people could afford to build, causing clients at Kurt, Sr</span>
				<span class='text'>s architectural firm to become scarce</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Sharp|2006|p=1360}} Vonnegut's brother and sister had finished their primary and secondary educations in [[private school]]s, but Vonnegut was placed in a [[state school|public school]], called Public School No</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Boomhower&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Boomhower|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was not bothered by this,{{efn|In fact, Vonnegut often described himself as a &quot;child of the Great Depression&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>She labored to regain the family's wealth and status, and Vonnegut said she expressed hatred &quot;as corrosive as hydrochloric acid&quot; for her husband</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Marvin2-3&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Marvin|2002|pp=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edith Vonnegut forayed into writing and tried to sell short stories to magazines like ''[[Collier's]]'' and ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' with no success</span>

				<span class='text'>Vonnegut said his tenure with the ''Echo'' allowed him to write for a large audience—his fellow students—rather than for a teacher, an experience he said was &quot;fun and easy&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Boomhower&quot; /&gt;After graduating from Shortridge in 1940, Vonnegut enrolled at [[Cornell University]] in [[Ithaca, New York]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He wanted to study the [[humanities]] or become an architect like his father, but his father{{efn|Kurt, Sr</span>
				<span class='text'>was embittered by his lack of work as an architect during the Great Depression, and feared a similar fate for his son</span>
				<span class='text'>He dismissed his son's desired areas of study as &quot;junk jewellery&quot;, and persuaded his son against following in his footsteps</span>

				<span class='text'>= Views ===== War ===In 2011, [[NPR]] wrote, &quot;Kurt Vonnegut's blend of anti-war sentiment and satire made him one of the most popular writers of the 1960s</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Vonnegut stated in a 1987 interview that, &quot;my own feeling is that civilization ended in World War I, and we're still trying to recover from that&quot;, and that he wanted to write war-focused works without glamorizing war itself</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|NPR|2011}} Vonnegut had not intended to publish again, but his anger against the [[Presidency of George W</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Daily Telegraph 2007}}''Slaughterhouse-Five'' is the Vonnegut novel best known for its antiwar themes, but the author expressed his beliefs in ways beyond the depiction of the destruction of Dresden</span>
				<span class='text'>He has one character, Mary O'Hare, opine that &quot;wars were partly encouraged by books and movies&quot;, made by &quot;[[Frank Sinatra]] or [[John Wayne]] or some of those other glamorous, war-loving, dirty old men&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Freese|2013|p=101}} Vonnegut made a number of comparisons between Dresden and the [[bombing of Hiroshima]] in ''Slaughterhouse-Five''{{sfn|Leeds|1995|p=2}} and wrote in ''Palm Sunday'' (1991) that &quot;I learned how vile that religion of mine could be when the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Leeds|1995|p=68}}Nuclear war, or at least deployed nuclear arms, is mentioned in almost all of Vonnegut's novels</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''Player Piano'', the computer EPICAC is given control of the nuclear arsenal, and is charged with deciding whether to use high-explosive or nuclear arms</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''Cat's Cradle'', John's original purpose in setting pen to paper is to write an account of what prominent Americans had been doing as Hiroshima was bombed</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Vonnegut|2009|pp=177, 185, 191}}{{sfn|Niose|2007}} In an interview for ''[[Playboy]]'', he stated that his forebears who came to the United States did not believe in God, and he learned his atheism from his parents</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Leeds|1995|p=480}} Like his great-grandfather Clemens, Vonnegut was a [[Freethought|freethinker]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Vonnegut|2009|p=177}} Vonnegut went to a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] church several times, but with little consistency</span>
				<span class='text'>In his autobiographical work ''Palm Sunday'', Vonnegut says he is a &quot;Christian worshipping agnostic</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He also talked about Jesus' [[Sermon on the Mount]], and the [[Beatitudes]],{{sfn|Vonnegut|2006b}} and made these biblical ideologies part of his own doctrine</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Davis|2006|p=142}} Vonnegut laced a number of his speeches with religion-focused rhetoric,{{sfn|Vonnegut|1999|loc=introduction}}{{sfn|Vonnegut|2009|pp=177, 185, 191}} and was prone to using such expressions as &quot;God forbid&quot; and &quot;thank God&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Niose|2007}}{{sfn|Vonnegut|2009|p=191}}Vonnegut would often talk about religion, in his novels and elsewhere</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''[[God Bless You, Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Kevorkian]]'', Vonnegut goes to Heaven after he is [[euthanasia|euthanized]] by Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Jack Kevorkian]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Once in Heaven, Vonnegut interviews twenty-one deceased celebrities, including [[Isaac Asimov]], [[William Shakespeare]], and [[Kilgore Trout]]—the last a fictional character from several of his novels</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Kohn|2001}} Vonnegut's works are filled with characters founding new faiths,{{sfn|Farrell|2009|p=141}} and religion often serves as a major plot device, for example in ''Player Piano'', ''The Sirens of Titan'' and ''Cat's Cradle''</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''The Sirens of Titans'', Rumfoord proclaims The Church of God the Utterly Indifferent</span>
				<span class='text'>''Slaughterhouse-Five'' sees Billy Pilgrim, lacking religion himself, nevertheless become a chaplain's assistant in the military and display a large crucifix on his bedroom wall</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Leeds|1995|pp=477–479}} In ''Cat's Cradle'', Vonnegut invented the religion of Bokononism</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=78}}Vonnegut had a deep dislike for the Christian religion, often reminding his readers of the bloody history of the Crusades and other religion-inspired violence</span>
				<span class='text'>He despised the [[televangelist]]s of the late 20th century, feeling that their thinking was narrow-minded</span>
				<span class='text'> Realizing that humans need a moral code by which to live, he greatly admired Christ's Sermon on the Mount,{{sfn|Farrell|2009|p=141}} and there are a string of references to it across his works</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''Palm Sunday'', he writes, &quot;The Sermon on the Mount suggests a mercifulness that can never waver or fade</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Leeds|1995|p=525}}  Vonnegut, in his 1991 book ''Fates Worse than Death'', suggests that during the Reagan administration, &quot;anything that sounded like the Sermon on the Mount was socialistic or communistic, and therefore anti-American&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Leeds|1995|p=525}} Vonnegut did not however disdain those who seek the comfort of religion, hailing church associations as a type of extended family</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Sharp|2006|p=1366}}=== Politics ===Vonnegut did not particularly sympathize with liberalism or conservatism, and mused on the specious simplicity of American politics</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;If you want to take my guns away from me, and you're all for murdering fetuses, and love it when homosexuals marry each other [</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> you're a liberal</span>
				<span class='text'>If you are against those perversions and for the rich, you're a conservative</span>
				<span class='text'>What could be simpler?&quot;{{sfn|Zinn|Arnove|2009|p=620}} Regarding political parties, Vonnegut said, &quot;The two real political parties in America are the Winners and the Losers</span>
				<span class='text'>The people don’t acknowledge this</span>
				<span class='text'>They claim membership in two imaginary parties, the Republicans and the Democrats, instead</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Vonnegut|2006a|loc=&quot;In a Manner that Must Shame God Himself&quot;}} Vonnegut disregarded more mainstream political ideologies in favor of [[socialism]], which he thought could provide a valuable substitute for what he saw as [[social Darwinism]] and a spirit of &quot;[[survival of the fittest]]&quot; in American society,{{sfn|Sharp|2006|pp=1364–1365}} believing that &quot;socialism would be a good for the common man&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Gannon|Taylor|2013}} Vonnegut would often return to a quote by socialist and five-time presidential candidate [[Eugene V</span>
				<span class='text'>Debs]], who went to prison for his beliefs: &quot;As long as there is a lower class, I am in it</span>
				<span class='text'>As long as there is a criminal element, I'm of it</span>
				<span class='text'>As long as there is a soul in prison, I am not free</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Sharp|2006|p=1364}}{{sfn|Zinn|Arnove|2009|p=618}} Vonnegut expressed disappointment that [[communism]] and socialism seemed to be unsavory topics to the average American, and believed that they may offer beneficial substitutes to contemporary social and economic systems</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Sharp|2006|p=1365}}== Writing ===== Influences ===Vonnegut's writing was inspired by an eclectic mix of sources</span>
				<span class='text'>When he was younger, Vonnegut stated that he read works of [[Pulp magazine|pulp fiction]], science fiction, fantasy, and action-adventure</span>
				<span class='text'>He also read the [[Classics]], like those of [[Aristophanes]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Aristophanes, like Vonnegut, wrote humorous critiques of contemporary society</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Marvin|2002|pp=17–18}} Vonnegut's life and work also share similarities with that of ''Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'' writer Mark Twain</span>
				<span class='text'>Both shared pessimistic outlooks on humanity, and a skeptical take on religion, and, as Vonnegut put it, were both &quot;associated with the enemy in a major war&quot;, as Twain briefly enlisted in the South's cause during the [[American Civil War]], and Vonnegut's German name and ancestry connected him with the United States' enemy in both world wars</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=18}}Vonnegut called [[George Orwell]] his favorite writer, and admitted that he tried to emulate Orwell</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;I like his concern for the poor, I like his socialism, I like his simplicity&quot;, Vonnegut said</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=19}} Vonnegut also said that Orwell's ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', and ''Brave New World'' by Aldous Huxley, heavily influenced his debut novel, ''Player Piano'', in 1952</span>
				<span class='text'>Vonnegut commented that [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s stories were emblems of thoughtfully put together works that he tried to mimic in his own compositions</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Sharp|2006|p=1366}} Vonnegut also hailed playwright and socialist [[George Bernard Shaw]] as &quot;a hero of [his]&quot;, and an &quot;enormous influence</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Barsamian|2004|p=15}} Within his own family, Vonnegut stated that his mother, Edith, had the greatest influence on him</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;[M]y mother thought she might make a new fortune by writing for the slick magazines</span>
				<span class='text'>She took short-story courses at night</span>
				<span class='text'>She studied magazines the way gamblers study racing forms</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Hayman|Michaelis|Plimpton|Rhodes|1977}}Early on in his career, Vonnegut decided to model his style after [[Henry David Thoreau]], who wrote as if from the perspective of a child, allowing Thoreau's works to be more widely comprehensible</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=18}} Using a youthful narrative voice allowed Vonnegut to deliver concepts in a modest and straightforward way</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Marvin|2002|pp=18–19}} Other influences on Vonnegut include ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' author [[H</span>
				<span class='text'>G</span>
				<span class='text'>Wells]], and satirist [[Jonathan Swift]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Vonnegut credited newspaper magnate [[H</span>
				<span class='text'>L</span>
				<span class='text'>Mencken]] for inspiring him to become a journalist</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Sharp|2006|p=1366}}=== Style and technique ==={{quote box|width=36%|align=right|quote=I've heard the Vonnegut voice described as &quot;manic depressive&quot;, and there's certainly something to this</span>
				<span class='text'>It has an incredible amount of energy married to a very deep and dark sense of despair</span>
				<span class='text'>It's frequently over-the-top, and scathingly satirical, but it never strays too far from pathos – from an immense sympathy for society's vulnerable, oppressed and powerless</span>
				<span class='text'>But, then, it also contains a huge allotment of warmth</span>
				<span class='text'>Most of the time, reading Kurt Vonnegut feels more like being spoken to by a very close friend</span>
				<span class='text'>There's an inclusiveness to his writing that draws you in, and his narrative voice is seldom absent from the story for any length of time</span>
				<span class='text'>Usually, it's right there in the foreground – direct, involving and extremely idiosyncratic</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Extence|2013}}|source=–[[Gavin Extence]], &lt;small&gt;''[[The Huffington Post]]'', 2013&lt;/small&gt;}}In his book ''Popular Contemporary Writers'', Michael D</span>
				<span class='text'>Sharp describes Vonnegut's linguistic style as straightforward; his sentences concise, his language simple, his paragraphs brief, and his ordinary tone conversational</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Sharp|2006|p=1364}} Vonnegut uses this style to convey normally complex subject matter in a way that is intelligible to a large audience</span>
				<span class='text'>He credited his time as a journalist for his ability, pointing to his work with the Chicago City News Bureau, which required him to convey stories in telephone conversations</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Extence|2013}}{{sfn|Sharp|2006|p=1364}} Vonnegut's compositions are also laced with distinct references to his own life, notably in ''Slaughterhouse-Five'' and ''Slapstick''</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Sharp|2006|pp=1363–1364}}Vonnegut believed that ideas, and the convincing communication of those ideas to the reader, were vital to literary art</span>
				<span class='text'>He did not always sugarcoat his points: much of ''Player Piano'' leads up to the moment when Paul, on trial and hooked up to a lie detector, is asked to tell a falsehood, and states, &quot;every new piece of scientific knowledge is a good thing for humanity&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Davis|2006|pp=45–46}} Robert T</span>
				<span class='text'>Tally, Jr</span>
				<span class='text'> in his volume on Vonnegut's novels, wrote, &quot;rather than tearing down and destroying the icons of twentieth-century, middle-class American life, Vonnegut gently reveals their basic flimsiness</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Tally|2011|p=157}} Vonnegut did not simply propose utopian solutions to the ills of American society, but showed how such schemes would not allow ordinary people to live lives free from want and anxiety</span>
				<span class='text'> The large artificial families that the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>population is formed into in ''Slapstick'' soon serve as an excuse for tribalism, with people giving no help to those not part of their group, and with the extended family's place in the social hierarchy becoming vital</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tally|2011|pp=103–105}}In the introduction to their essay &quot;Kurt Vonnegut and Humor&quot;, Tally and Peter C</span>
				<span class='text'>Kunze suggest that Vonnegut was not a &quot;[[Black comedy|black humorist]]&quot;, but a &quot;frustrated idealist&quot; who used &quot;comic parables&quot; to teach the reader absurd, bitter or hopeless truths, with his grim witticisms serving to make the reader laugh rather than cry</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Vonnegut makes sense through humor, which is, in the author's view, as valid a means of mapping this crazy world as any other strategies</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Kunze|Tally, Jr</span>
				<span class='text'>2012|loc=introduction}} Vonnegut resented being called a black humorist, feeling that, as with many literary labels, it allows readers to disregard aspects of a writer's work that do not fit the label's stereotype</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=16}}Vonnegut's works have, at various times, been labeled science fiction, [[satire]] and [[Postmodern literature|postmodern]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=13}} He also resisted such labels, but his works do contain common [[Trope (literature)|tropes]] that are often associated with those genres</span>
				<span class='text'>In several of his books, Vonnegut imagines alien societies and civilizations, as is common in works of science fiction, but unlike conventional science fiction, Vonnegut does this to emphasize or exaggerate absurdities and idiosyncrasies in our own world</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Marvin|2002|pp=14–15}} Furthermore, Vonnegut often humorizes the problems that plague societies, as is done in satirical works</span>
				<span class='text'>However, literary theorist [[Robert Scholes]] noted in ''Fabulation and Metafiction'' that Vonnegut &quot;reject[s] the traditional satirist's faith in the efficacy of satire as a reforming instrument</span>
				<span class='text'>[He has] a more subtle faith in the humanizing value of laughter</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=15}}Examples of [[postmodernism]] may also be found in Vonnegut's works</span>
				<span class='text'>Postmodernism often entails a response to the theory that the truths of the world will be discovered through science</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=16}} Postmodernists contend that truth is subjective, rather than objective, as it is biased towards each individual's beliefs and outlook on the world</span>
				<span class='text'>They often use [[unreliable narrator|unreliable]], [[first-person narration]], and narrative [[Postmodern literature#Fragmentation|fragmentation]]</span>
				<span class='text'>While Vonnegut does use these elements in some of his works, he more distinctly focuses on the peril posed by individuals who find subjective truths, mistake them for objective truths, then proceed to impose these truths on others</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Marvin|2002|pp=16–17}}=== Themes ===Vonnegut was a vocal critic of the society in which he lived, and this was reflected in his writings</span>
				<span class='text'>Several key social themes recur in Vonnegut's works, such as wealth, the lack of it, and its unequal distribution among a society</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''The Sirens of Titan'', the novel's protagonist, Malachi Constant, is exiled to one of [[Saturn]]'s moons, [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], as a result of his vast wealth, which has made him arrogant and wayward</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Marvin|2002|pp=19, 44–45}} In ''God Bless You, Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Rosewater'', readers may find it difficult to determine whether the rich or the poor are in worse circumstances as the lives of both group's members are ruled by their wealth or their poverty</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=19}} Further, in ''Hocus Pocus'', the protagonist is named Eugene Debs Hartke, a homage to the famed socialist Eugene V</span>
				<span class='text'>Debs and Vonnegut's socialist views</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Sharp|2006|p=1364}} In ''Kurt Vonnegut: A Critical Companion'', Thomas F</span>
				<span class='text'>Marvin states: &quot;Vonnegut points out that, left unchecked, capitalism will erode the democratic foundations of the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Marvin suggests that Vonnegut's works demonstrate what happens when a &quot;hereditary aristocracy&quot; develops, where wealth is inherited along familial lines: the ability of poor Americans to overcome their situations is greatly or completely diminished</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=19}} Vonnegut also often laments social Darwinism, and a &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; view of society</span>
				<span class='text'>He points out that social Darwinism leads to a society that condemns its poor for their own misfortune, and fails to help them out of their poverty because &quot;they deserve their fate&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Sharp|2006|pp=1364–1365}} Vonnegut also confronts the idea of [[free will]] in a number of his pieces</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''Slaughterhouse-Five'' and ''Timequake'' the characters have no choice in what they do; in ''Breakfast of Champions'', a character believes that he has everyone's free will; and in ''Cat's Cradle'', Bokononism views free will as [[heresy|heretical]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Sharp|2006|p=1366}}The majority of Vonnegut's characters are estranged from their actual families and seek to build replacement or extended families</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, the engineers in ''Player Piano'' called their manager's spouse &quot;Mom&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''Cat's Cradle'', Vonnegut devises two separate methods for loneliness to be combated: A &quot;karass&quot;, which is a group of individuals appointed by God to do his will, and a &quot;[[granfalloon]]&quot;, defined by Marvin as a &quot;meaningless association of people, such as a fraternal group or a nation&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=20}} Similarly, in ''Slapstick'', the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>government codifies that all Americans are a part of large extended families</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Sharp|2006|p=1365}}Fear of the loss of one's purpose in life is a theme in Vonnegut's works</span>
				<span class='text'>The Great Depression forced Vonnegut to witness the devastation many people felt when they lost their jobs, and while at General Electric, Vonnegut witnessed machines being built to take the place of human labor</span>
				<span class='text'>He confronts these things in his works through references to the growing use of automation and its effects on human society</span>
				<span class='text'>This is most starkly represented in his first novel, ''Player Piano'', where many Americans are left purposeless and unable to find work as machines replace human workers</span>
				<span class='text'>Loss of purpose is also depicted in ''Galápagos'', where a florist rages at her spouse for creating a robot able to do her job, and in ''Timequake'', where an architect kills himself when replaced by computer software</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Sharp|2006|pp=1365–1366}}Suicide by fire is another common theme in Vonnegut's works; the author often returns to the theory that &quot;many people are not fond of life</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He uses this as an explanation for why humans have so severely damaged their environments, and made devices such as [[nuclear weapon]]s that can make their creators extinct</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Sharp|2006|p=1365}} In ''Deadeye Dick'', Vonnegut features the [[neutron bomb]], designed to kill people, but leave buildings and structures untouched</span>
				<span class='text'>He also uses this theme to demonstrate the recklessness of those who put powerful, apocalypse-inducing devices at the disposal of politicians</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=21}}&quot;What is the point of life?&quot; is a question Vonnegut often pondered in his works</span>
				<span class='text'>When one of Vonnegut's characters, Kilgore Trout, finds the question &quot;What is the purpose of life?&quot; written in a bathroom, his response is, &quot;To be the eyes and ears and conscience of the Creator of the Universe, you fool</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Trout's theory is curious seeing that Vonnegut was an atheist, and thus for him, there is no Creator to report back to</span>
				<span class='text'>Marvin comments that, &quot;[a]s Trout chronicles one meaningless life after another, readers are left to wonder how a compassionate creator could stand by and do nothing while such reports come in</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; In the [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] to ''Bluebeard'', Vonnegut quotes his son Mark, and gives an answer to what he believes is the meaning of life: &quot;We are here to help each other get through this thing, whatever it is</span>
