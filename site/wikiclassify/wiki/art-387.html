				<span class='text'>he first [[Christian]] ruler of [[Poland]], Mieszko I is considered the ''[[de facto]]'' creator of the Polish state</span>
				<span class='text'>He continued the policy of both his father and grandfather, who were rulers of the pagan tribes located in the area of present-day [[Greater Poland]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Through both alliances and the use of military force, Mieszko extended ongoing Polish conquests and early in his reign subjugated [[Kuyavia]] and probably [[Gdańsk Pomerania]] and [[Masovia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>For most of his reign, Mieszko I was involved in warfare for the control of [[West Pomeranian Voivodeship|Western Pomerania]], eventually conquering it up to the vicinity of the lower [[Oder]] river</span>
				<span class='text'>During the last years of his life, he fought the [[Bohemia]]n state, winning [[Silesia]] and probably [[Lesser Poland]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ieszko I's marriage in 965 to the [[Czechs|Czech]] [[Přemyslid]] princess [[Dobrawa of Bohemia|Dobrawa]] and his [[Baptism of Poland|baptism]] in 966 put him and his country in the cultural sphere of Western [[Christianity]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Apart from the great conquests accomplished during his reign (which proved to be fundamental for the future of Poland) Mieszko I was renowned for his internal reforms, aimed at expanding and improving the so-called war monarchy system</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to existing sources, Mieszko I was a wise politician, a talented military leader, and a charismatic ruler</span>
				<span class='text'>He successfully used diplomacy, concluding alliances, first with [[Bohemia]] , then [[Sweden]], and the [[Holy Roman Empire]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In foreign policy, he placed the interests of his country foremost, even entering into agreements with his former enemies</span>
				<span class='text'>On his death, he left to his sons a country with greatly expanded territories, and a well-established position in Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>ieszko I also enigmatically appeared as &quot;Dagome&quot; in a [[papal]] document dating to about 1085, called ''[[Dagome iudex]]'', which mentions a gift or dedication of Mieszko's land to the [[Pope]] (the act took place almost a hundred years earlier)</span>
				<span class='text'>=Date of birth==There is no certain information on Mieszko I's life before he took control over his lands</span>
				<span class='text'>Only the ''Lesser Poland Chronicle'' gives the date of his birth as somewhere between the years 920–931 (depending on the version of the manuscript), however, modern researchers don't recognize the Chronicle as a reliable source</span>
				<span class='text'>Several historians on the basis of their investigations postulated the date of Mieszko I's birth to have been between 922–945;&lt;ref&gt;ca</span>
				<span class='text'>922 (O</span>
				<span class='text'>Balzer), between  930–932 (A</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Grabski), ca</span>
				<span class='text'>935 (K</span>
				<span class='text'>Jasiński), between 940–945 (S</span>
				<span class='text'>Kętrzyński)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; the activity of the Duke in his final years of life puts the date of his birth closer to the latter year</span>

				<span class='text'>IV&lt;/ref&gt;==Origin and meaning of his name==[[File:Mieszko I</span>
				<span class='text'>NG|166px|right|thumb|200px|Mieszko I graphic of [[Walery Eljasz-Radzikowski]] from the 19th century]]There are three major theories concerning the origin and meaning of Mieszko I's name</span>
				<span class='text'>The most popular theory, proposed by [[Jan Długosz]], explains that Mieszko is a diminutive of ''Mieczysław'', a combination of two elements or lexemes: ''Miecz'' meaning sword and ''Sław'' meaning famous</span>
				<span class='text'>Today, this theory is rejected by the majority of Polish historians, who consider the name Mieczysław to have been invented by Długosz to explain the origin of the name Mieszko</span>
				<span class='text'>Today, we know that ancient Slavs never formed their names using either animal names or weapon names</span>
				<span class='text'>Ancient Slavic names were abstract in nature</span>
				<span class='text'>The same explanation rules out another theory about the origin of the name Mieszko, which links the name with the Polish word miś/miśko meaning bear, as no animal names were used to form honorable Polish names among Polish nobility</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;WKK&quot;&gt;Włodzimierz K</span>
				<span class='text'>Krzyżanowski, ''&quot;Arystokracja rodowa w Polsce&quot;'', Warszawa, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;The second most popular theory about the origin and sense of Mieszko's name can be traced to the very old legend, firstly described by [[Gallus Anonymus]], according to which Mesco (the [[Latin]]ized form used by the earliest sources) was blind during his first seven years of life</span>
				<span class='text'>The chronicler related this story (a typical [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[allegory]]) as follows:::''At that time (after Mieszko recovered his eyesight) Prince Siemomysł urgently asked the elderly people of his country whether his son's blindness conveyed some miraculous meaning</span>
				<span class='text'>They explained that this blindness meant that Poland was blind back then, but from now was going to be illuminated by Mieszko and elevated over the neighboring nations</span>
				<span class='text'>'This interpretation was a clear reference to the later baptism of the Duke:::''Poland was indeed blind before, knowing nothing about the true God or the principles of the Catholic faith, but thanks to the enlightenment of Mieszko the country also had become enlightened, because when he adopted the faith, the Polish nation was saved from death and destruction''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gallus Anonymus, ''Kronika polska'', vol</span>
				<span class='text'>I, chap</span>
				<span class='text'>4&lt;/ref&gt;In addition, it is known that the Slavic word &quot;''mzec''&quot; can be interpreted as “having his eyes closed” or “be blind”</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet again, today it is almost certain that this legend was used as a metaphor, in allusion to the old Slavic pagan ceremony known as the &quot;[[Postrzyżyny#Polish|postrzyżyny]]&quot;: During that ceremony hair cutting was performed to every boy at the age of seven</span>
				<span class='text'>In that symbolic rite a child became a man</span>
				<span class='text'>That explains that Mieszko wasn't blind in fact</span>
				<span class='text'>He was blind only metaphorically</span>
				<span class='text'>Besides his son’s name was also Mieszko and it is hard to believe that he was also blind</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, as we know today ancient Slavs used only abstract names among nobility</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;WKK&quot;/&gt;The third theory links the name of Mieszko with his other name, Dagome, as it appeared in the document called ''[[Dagome iudex]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>We know this document only from a copy prepared by an anonymous monk who was not familiar with Polish language or Polish names</span>
				<span class='text'>It is possible that while copying the document he made a mistake and wrote down Dagome instead of Dagomer or even Dagomir</span>
				<span class='text'>The name Dagomir is used to this day and its construction is similar to other Polish names like for example: Władimir/Włodzimierz or Casimir/Kazimierz</span>
				<span class='text'>The evolution of the “-mir” element to “-mierz” is due to two separate developments: first, the regular change of the vowel &quot;i&quot; to &quot;(i)e&quot; before &quot;r&quot;, and second, the modification of the nominative case by the vocative for certain names (hence, Kazimierz replaced Kazimier based on the vocative Kazimierze)</span>
				<span class='text'>It is debatable whether the name Mieszko is a nickname formed from the second part of the name *Dago-mierz, since the merger in pronunciation of &quot;sz&quot; with the devoiced &quot;rz&quot; which would appear in this position is quite recent</span>
				<span class='text'> The word mir can be translated as peace</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;WKK&quot;/&gt; However, some historians believe that the word &quot;Dagome&quot; is a melding of two names: the Roman Catholic &quot;Dago,&quot; for &quot;Dagobert&quot; (Mieszko's hypothetical baptismal name), and the Slavic &quot;Me,&quot; for &quot;Mieszko</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The Latin word &quot;iudex&quot; (&quot;judge&quot;) would be used in the meaning of &quot;prince</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Another interpretation is that &quot;Dagome iudex&quot; is a corruption of &quot;Ego Mesco dux&quot; (&quot;I, Prince Mieszko&quot;)</span>

				<span class='text'>121–122&lt;/ref&gt; Soon the new ruler had faced the task of integrating the relatively large, ethnically and culturally heterogeneous territory</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the residents of areas controlled by Mieszko spoke mostly one language, had similar beliefs and reached a similar level of economic and general development, they were socially connected primarily by [[tribe|tribal]] structures</span>
				<span class='text'>It appears that the elders cooperating with the Duke first felt the need for super-tribal unity, as expansion allowed them to broaden their influence</span>
				<span class='text'>ieszko and his people were described around 966 by [[Abraham ben Jacob]], a [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi Jewish]] traveller, who at that time visited the [[Prague]] court of Duke [[Boleslaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Boleslav I the Cruel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[Jerzy Wyrozumski]] – ''Dzieje Polski piastowskiej'' (VIII w</span>
				<span class='text'>– 1370) (History of Piast Poland (8th century – 1370)), Kraków 1999, p</span>
				<span class='text'>76&lt;/ref&gt; Abraham presented Mieszko I as one of the four [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] &quot;kings&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Jerzy Wyrozumski – ''Dzieje Polski piastowskiej'' (VIII w</span>
				<span class='text'>– 1370) (History of Piast Poland (8th century – 1370)), Kraków 1999, p</span>
				<span class='text'>77&lt;/ref&gt; reigning over a vast &quot;northern&quot; area, with a highly regarded and substantial military force at his disposal</span>
				<span class='text'>More precise contemporary records regarding Mieszko were compiled by [[Widukind of Corvey]], and half a century later, by Bishop [[Thietmar of Merseburg]]</span>
				<span class='text'>y the time Mieszko I took over from his father, the [[Polans (western)|Polans]]' tribal federation of [[Greater Poland]] had for some time been actively expanding</span>
				<span class='text'>Continuing this process, perhaps in the first years of Mieszko's reign, if it had not been done already by his father, Mieszko I conquered [[Masovia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Likely also during that period or earlier, at least partially [[Gdańsk Pomerania]] was obtained</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Jasiński&quot;/&gt;  Mieszko's interests were then concentrated mainly on areas occupied by the eastern (near the [[Oder|Oder River]]) branches of the [[Polabian Slavs]]; some of them became soon subordinated by him</span>
				<span class='text'>As Widukind of Corvey wrote, Mieszko ruled over the tribe called the ''Licicaviki'', now commonly identified with the Polabian [[Lubusz Land]]</span>

				<span class='text'> S</span>
				<span class='text'>Szczur, ''Historia Polski średniowiecze'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>26&lt;/ref&gt; Having the control over those more western (in respect to the original homeland of the Polans) tribes, Mieszko had entered the [[Holy Roman Empire|German]] sphere of influence</span>
				<span class='text'>n 963 the German [[Margrave]] [[Gero]] conquered territories occupied by the Polabian [[Lusatia]]n and Słupian tribes, and as a result came into direct contact with the Polish state</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time (about 960) Mieszko I began his expansion against the [[Velunzani]] and [[Lutici]] tribes</span>
				<span class='text'>The war was recorded by the chronicler [[Abraham ben Jacob]]</span>
				<span class='text'>According to him, Mieszko I had fought against the Weltaba tribe, commonly identified with the Veleti</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Wichmann the Younger]], a Saxon nobleman who was then a leader of a band of Polabian Slavs, defeated Mieszko twice, and around 963 a brother of Mieszko, whose name is unknown, was killed in the fighting</span>
				<span class='text'>The frontiers at the mouth of the [[Oder|Oder River]] were also desired by the German margraves</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, the Veleti Bohemia, which at that time possessed [[Silesia]] and [[Lesser Poland]] regions, constituted a danger for the young state of the Polans</span>
				<span class='text'>==Margrave Gero's war; Mieszko's homage to the Emperor===The chronicle of Thietmar poses some problems of interpretation of the information regarding the attack of Margrave Gero on the Slavic tribes, as a result of which he purportedly ''subordinated to the authority of the Emperor Lusatia and the Selpuli'' (meaning the Słupian tribes) ''and also Mieszko with his subjects''</span>
				<span class='text'>According to the majority of modern historians,&lt;ref&gt;see for example G</span>
				<span class='text'>Labuda, ''Mieszko I'', chap</span>
				<span class='text'>III</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Thietmar made an error summarizing the chronicle of Widukind, placing the Gero raid there instead of the fighting that Mieszko conducted at that time against Wichmann the Younger</span>
				<span class='text'>Other sources make no mention of such conquest and of putting the Polans state on the same footing with the Polabian Slavs</span>
				<span class='text'>On the other hand, the supporters of the Gero's invasion theory&lt;ref&gt;see for example Henryk Łowmianski, ''Początki Polski'', Warsaw, 1973</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; believe that the Margrave did actually carry out a successful invasion, as a result of which Mieszko I was forced to pay tribute to [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|the Emperor]] and also was compelled to adopt Catholicism through the German Church</span>
				<span class='text'>The thesis that proposes the introduction of Catholicism as a result of this war finds no confirmation in German sources</span>
				<span class='text'>he homage is then a separate issue, since, according to the chronicle of Thietmar, Mieszko  actually paid tribute to the Emperor from the lands ''usque in Vurta fluvium'' (up to the [[Warta]] River)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Thietmari chronicon'', vol</span>
				<span class='text'>II chap</span>
				<span class='text'>29&lt;/ref&gt; In all probability Mieszko decided to pay tribute in order to avoid an invasion similar to the one that Lusatia had suffered</span>
				<span class='text'>This homage would take place in 965, or in 966 at the latest</span>
				<span class='text'>Very likely the tribute applied only to the [[Lubusz]] land, which was in the German sphere of influence</span>

				<span class='text'>Grabski, ''Bolesław Chrobry'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>25&lt;/ref&gt; This understanding of the tribute issue explains why already in 967 Mieszko I was described in the Saxon chronicles as the Emperor's friend (or ally, supporter, [[Latin language|Latin]]: ''amicus imperatoris'')</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This political [[Polish-Bohemian alliance]] is likely to have been initiated by the Polish ruler</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;G</span>
				<span class='text'>Labuda, ''Mieszko I'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>92&lt;/ref&gt;The next step was the baptism of Mieszko</span>
				<span class='text'>There are different hypotheses concerning this event</span>
				<span class='text'>Most often it is assumed that it was a political decision, intended to bring Mieszko's state closer to the [[Czech (people)|Czech]]s and to facilitate his activities in the [[Polabian Slavs]] area</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time, the baptism decreased the likelihood of future attacks by German margraves and deprived them of the opportunity to attempt Roman Catholicization of Mieszko's lands by force</span>
				<span class='text'>An additional reason could be Mieszko's desire to remove from power the influential pagan priest class, who may have been blocking his efforts to establish a more centralized rule</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;G</span>
				<span class='text'>Labuda, ''Mieszko I'', chap</span>
				<span class='text'>IV</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;A different hypothesis is linked with the above-mentioned acceptance of the veracity of Gero's invasion of Poland</span>
				<span class='text'>According to it, it was the attack of the Margrave that forced the Catholicization, which was to be an act of subordination to the Emperor, done without the mediation of the Pope</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;H</span>
				<span class='text'>Łowmiański, ''Początki Polski'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>342-345</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Still other motives were responsible according to [[Gallus Anonymus]], who claimed that it was the Bohemian Princess Dobrawa who convinced her husband to change his religion</span>
				<span class='text'>Likewise chronicler Thietmar attributes Mieszko's conversion to Dobrawa's influence</span>
				<span class='text'>There are no reasons to negate Dobrawa's role in Mieszko's acceptance of Roman Catholicism; however crediting rulers' wives with positive influence over their husbands' actions was a common convention at that time</span>
				<span class='text'>t is generally recognized that the baptism of Mieszko I took place in 966</span>

				<span class='text'>92–97</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The belief that the baptism was accomplished through the Czechs in order to avoid the dependence on Germany and the German Church is incorrect,&lt;ref&gt;[http://monika</span>

				<span class='text'>da</span>
				<span class='text'>l/~literat/histp/polish</span>
				<span class='text'>tm Historii Polski by Anna Paner and Jan Iluk]&lt;/ref&gt; because Bohemia would not have its own church organization until 973</span>
				<span class='text'>At the time of the baptism of Mieszko the existing Bohemian church establishment was a part of the Regensburg diocese</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, if the Polish ruler accepted the baptism through Prague's mediation, it had to be sanctioned in Regensburg</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the religious vocabulary (words like baptism, sermon, prayer, church, apostle, bishop or confirmation) were adopted from the [[Czech language]] and had to come from Dobrawa's entourage and the church elements that arrived with her</span>
				<span class='text'>Perhaps with her also came the first Polish bishop, [[Jordan (Bishop of Poland)|Jordan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It could be that the reason for the Czech preference of Mieszko was the existence in Bohemia of a mission which followed the precepts of the [[Byzantine Greek]] brothers and later [[saints Cyril and Methodius]], who developed and performed the liturgy in the Slavic rite, more readily understood by Mieszko and his subjects</span>
				<span class='text'>The Slavic rite church branch had survived in Bohemia for another hundred years after Mieszko's baptism</span>
				<span class='text'>==Consequences of Catholicization==={{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}Through the adoption of Catholicism Mieszko I included his Polish state in the community European western [[Latin]] rite Roman Catholic states</span>
				<span class='text'>The Holy Roman Empire or any other Catholic country, in theory, had no right to attack Poland under the pretext of spreading Catholicism or for other unjust reasons, because the Duke of the Polans had become a member of the Roman Catholic circle</span>
				<span class='text'>he baptism also started the spread of the [[Roman Empire|Latin culture]] into Poland, with the first literate and educated churchmen-advisers joining Mieszko's court</span>
				<span class='text'>The missionary bishopric started by Jordan in 968 used the Latin liturgy and was directly subordinate to the Papacy</span>
				<span class='text'>Churches were being built at [[Gniezno]], [[Poznań]], [[Ostrów Lednicki]] and elsewhere</span>
				<span class='text'>The existence of the missionary diocese emphasized the individuality and independence of the Polish state</span>
				<span class='text'>t the time of the reign of Mieszko there was no single place serving as the capital, instead he built several ''[[palace|palatium]]s'' around his country</span>
				<span class='text'>The most important locations were [[Poznań]] ([[Ostrów Tumski, Poznań|Ostrów Tumski]]), [[Gniezno]] and [[Ostrów Lednicki]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The latter was a ring-fort some 500 meters in circumference, containing the duke's residence, a stone palace, the country's first monumental architecture</span>
				<span class='text'>he Catholicization had also led to political changes</span>
				<span class='text'>The emergent power structures were independent of the traditional tribal elders and limited their authority</span>
				<span class='text'>Clergy who arrived in the country contributed to the development of education and culture, and of the state administration and diplomacy</span>
				<span class='text'>At the end of Mieszko's reign (ca</span>
				<span class='text'>990) Poland began to pay tribute to the pope ([[Peter's Pence]])</span>
				<span class='text'>owever, the conversion of the Polish population into Catholicism was a long-term process and was not be completed during the reign of Mieszko I</span>
				<span class='text'>The duke probably had to deal with rebellions led by the old pagan priest caste</span>
				<span class='text'>In some villages, the old Slavic beliefs and customs were continued until the 16th century</span>
				<span class='text'>==Conquest of Pomerania===[[Image:Mieszko I of Poland</span>
				<span class='text'>NG|thumb|266px|Mieszko I, early 17th century illustration]]After the normalization of relations with the Holy Roman Empire and Bohemia, Mieszko I returned to his plans of conquest of the [[West Pomeranian Voivodeship|more western part of Pomerania]]</span>
				<span class='text'>On 21 September 967 the Polish-Bohemian troops prevailed in the decisive battle against the [[Wolin]]ians led by [[Wichmann the Younger]], which gave Mieszko the control over the mouth of the Odra River</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Probably not the main stronghold of the region – [[Wolin (town)|Wolin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>G</span>
				<span class='text'>Labuda, ''Mieszko I'', cap</span>
				<span class='text'>V</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The German margraves had not opposed Mieszko's activities in Pomerania, perhaps even supported them; the death of the rebellious Wichmann, who succumbed to his wounds soon after the battle, may have been in line with their interests</span>
				<span class='text'>A telling incident took place after the battle, a testimony to Mieszko's high standing among the Empire's dignitaries, just one year after his baptism: Widukind of Corvey reported that the dying Wichmann asked Mieszko to hand over Wichmann's weapons to Emperor Otto I, to whom Wichmann was related</span>
				<span class='text'>For Mieszko the victory had to be a satisfying experience, especially in light of his past defeats inflicted by Wichmann</span>
				<span class='text'>he exact result of Mieszko's fighting in [[West Pomeranian Voivodeship|Western Pomerania]] is not known</span>
				<span class='text'>Subsequent loss of the region by Mieszko's son [[Bolesław I Chrobry|Bolesław Chrobry]] suggests that the conquest was difficult and the hold over that territory rather tenuous</span>
				<span class='text'>In one version of the legend of [[Adalbert of Prague|St</span>
				<span class='text'>Wojciech]]&lt;ref&gt;Legend of the 12th century, starting with the words ''Tempore illo''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; it is written that Mieszko I had his daughter&lt;ref&gt;Other sources indicated that she could be Mieszko I's sister</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; married to a Pomeranian prince, who previously voluntarily ''was washed with the holy water of the baptism'' in Poland</span>
				<span class='text'>The above information, as well as the fact that Bolesław lost Western Pomerania, suggest that the region was not truly incorporated into the Polish state, but only became a [[fiefdom|fief]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This conjecture seems to be confirmed in the introduction of the first volume of the chronicles of [[Gallus Anonymus]] concerning the Pomeranians: ''Although often the leaders of the forces defeated by the Polish duke sought salvation in baptism, as soon as they regained their strength, they repudiated the 'Christian' (that is, Roman Catholic) faith and started the war against Christian anew''</span>
				<span class='text'>==War against Margrave Odo I of Ostmark===In 972 Poland suffered the attack of [[Odo I, Margrave of the Saxon Ostmark]]</span>
				<span class='text'>According to the chronicles of Thietmar, this attack was an arbitrary action, without the consent of the Emperor:::''Meanwhile,&lt;ref&gt;At that time, Emperor Otto I was in Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; the noble Margrave Hodo, having collected his army attacked Mieszko, who has been faithfully paying tribute to the Emperor (for the lands) up the Warta river</span>

				<span class='text'>II p</span>
				<span class='text'>29&lt;/ref&gt;''{{See also|Battle of Cedynia}}There are different hypotheses concerning the reasons for this invasion</span>
				<span class='text'>Possibly Margrave Odo wanted to stop the growing power of the Polish state</span>
				<span class='text'>Very likely Odo wanted to protect the Wolinian state, which he considered his zone of influence, from the Polish take-over</span>

				<span class='text'>Labuda, ''Mieszko I'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>122</span>

				<span class='text'>The same argument was also given by S</span>
				<span class='text'>Szczur, ''Historia Polski średniowiecze'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>51</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In any event, Odo's forces moved in  and on 24 June 972 twice engaged Mieszko's army at the village of ''Cidini'', commonly identified with [[Cedynia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>At first, the Margrave defeated Mieszko's forces; subsequently the Duke's brother [[Czcibor]] defeated the Germans in the decisive stage, inflicting great losses among their troops</span>
				<span class='text'>It may be that Mieszko intentionally staged the retreat, which was followed by a surprise attack on the flank of the German pursuing troops</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;According to the reconstruction of the battle by W</span>
				<span class='text'>Filipiowak</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; After this battle, Mieszko and Odo were called to the Imperial Diet in [[Quedlinburg]] in 973 to explain and justify their conduct</span>
				<span class='text'>The exact judgment of the Emperor is unknown, but it's certain that the sentence wasn't carried out because he died a few weeks after the Diet</span>
				<span class='text'>It is commonly assumed that the sentence was unfavorable to the Polish ruler</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''[[Annales Altahenses|Annals of Altaich]]'' indicates that Mieszko was not present in Quedlinburg during the gathering; instead, he had to send his son Bolesław as a hostage</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date = August 2013}}Mieszko's conflict with Odo I was a surprising event because, according to Thietmar, Mieszko respected the Margrave highly</span>
				<span class='text'>Thietmar wrote the following:::''Mieszko would never wear his outdoor garment in a house where Odo was present, or remain seated after Odo had gotten up</span>
				<span class='text'>'It is believed that in practical terms the victory at Cedynia sealed [[West Pomeranian Voivodeship|Western Pomerania]]'s fate as Mieszko' dependency</span>
				<span class='text'>==Acquisitions in the east===According to archaeological research, during the 970s the [[Sandomierz]] region and the [[Przemyśl]] area inhabited by the [[Lendians]] became incorporated into the Polish state</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Historia Polski średniowiecze'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>35</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; None of it is certain for the lack of written sources</span>
				<span class='text'>It is possible that especially the Przemyśl area, inhabited by the Lendians and the [[White Croats]], belonged at that time to Bohemia, which supposedly extended up to the [[Bug River]] and [[Styr River]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;The limits were described in the document issued by the bishop of Prague to [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This document is preserved in the Chronicles of [[Cosmas of Prague]] and is considered a reliable copy; from G</span>
				<span class='text'>Labuda ''Mieszko I'' pp</span>
				<span class='text'>148–151</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The [[Primary Chronicle]] states that in 981 [[Vladimir I of Kiev|Vladimir]] of the [[Rurik Dynasty]] ''went towards the Lachy and took their towns: Przemyśl, [[Czermno, Lublin Voivodeship|Czerwień]] and other strongholds (</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>''</span>
				<span class='text'>The exact interpretation of this passage is uncertain, because the [[Rus' (people)|Ruthenian]] word &quot;Lachy&quot; meant both the Poles in general and the southeastern Lendians tribe</span>

				<span class='text'>Sandomierz under this scenario was the central hub of the area, with Czerwień, Przemyśl and [[Chełm]] assuming the function of defensive borderland strongholds</span>

				<span class='text'>Mieszko may have been motivated by revenge because of the (presumably) negative verdict of the Quedlinburg summit, but may be more importantly he wanted more favorable terms for his cooperation with Germany</span>

				<span class='text'>The Duke of Bavaria was defeated, and Emperor Otto II regained full power</span>
				<span class='text'>Shortly afterwards the young emperor waged a retaliatory expedition against Bohemia, forcing in 978 Duke Boleslav into submission</span>

				<span class='text'>Due to bad weather, the Emperor was back at the border of [[Thuringia]] and [[Saxony]] in December of that year</span>
				<span class='text'>It is uncertain whether the invasion actually took place</span>

				<span class='text'>Archaeological discoveries appear to support the thesis of Otto II's invasion</span>

				<span class='text'>It appears that during this time Mieszko I married [[Oda of Haldensleben|Oda]], daughter of [[Dietrich of Haldensleben]], Margrave of the [[Northern March]], after abducting her from the monastery of [[Kalbe]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;It is understood that the marriage took place around 979–980 (S, Szczur, ''Historia Polski średniowiecze'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>53)</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The marriage with Oda considerably affected the position and prestige of Mieszko, who entered the world of [[Saxony|Saxon]] aristocracy</span>
				<span class='text'>As a son-in-law of Margrave Dietrich, he gained an ally in one of the most influential politicians of the Holy Roman Empire</span>
				<span class='text'>As the Margrave was a distant relative of the Emperor, Mieszko became a member of the circle connected to the [[Ottonian dynasty|imperial ruling house]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==Cooperation with Sweden and the war against Denmark===Probably in the early 980s Mieszko allied his country with [[Sweden]] against [[Denmark]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The alliance was sealed with the marriage of Mieszko's daughter [[Sigrid the Haughty|Świętosława]] with the Swedish king [[Eric the Victorious|Erik]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The content of the treaty is known from the not entirely reliable, but originating directly from the Danish court tradition account given by [[Adam of Bremen]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In this text, probably as a result of confusion, he gives instead of Mieszko's name the name of his son Bolesław:::''The King of the Swedes, Erik, entered into an alliance with the very powerful King of the Polans, Bolesław</span>
				<span class='text'>Bolesław gave Erik his daughter or sister</span>
				<span class='text'>Because of this cooperation the Danes were routed by the Slavs and the Swedes</span>

				<span class='text'>They may have acted in cooperation with the [[Wolin]]ian autonomous entity</span>
				<span class='text'>The Danish were defeated ca</span>
				<span class='text'>991 and their ruler was expelled</span>

				<span class='text'>The resulting weakness of the imperial power was exploited by the [[Lutici]], who initiated a great uprising of the [[Polabian Slavs]] in 983</span>
				<span class='text'>The German authority in the area ceased to exist and the Polabian tribes began to threaten the Empire</span>
				<span class='text'>The death of Otto II at the end of that year contributed further to the unrest</span>
				<span class='text'>Ultimately the [[Lutici]] and the [[Obotrites]] were able to liberate themselves from the German rule for the next two centuries</span>

				<span class='text'>Like in 973, Mieszko and the Czech duke [[Boleslaus II, Duke of Bohemia|Boleslav II]] took the side of the Bavarian duke</span>
				<span class='text'>This fact is confirmed in the chronicle of Thietmar:::''There arrived'' (at the Diet of [[Quedlinburg]]) ''also, among many other princes: Mieszko, Mściwoj and Boleslav and promised to support him under oath as the king and ruler''</span>

				<span class='text'>2&lt;/ref&gt;In 984 the Czechs took over [[Meissen]], but in the same year Henry II gave up his pretension to the German throne</span>
				<span class='text'>he role played by Mieszko I in the subsequent struggles is unclear because the contemporary sources are scarce and not in agreement</span>
				<span class='text'>Probably in 985 the Polish ruler ended his support for the Bavarian duke and moved to the side of the Emperor</span>
				<span class='text'>It is believed that Mieszko's motivation was the threat posed to his interests by the Polabian Slavs uprising</span>
				<span class='text'>The upheaval was a problem for both Poland and Germany, but not for Bohemia</span>
				<span class='text'>In the ''Chronicle of [[Hildesheim]]'', in the entry for the year 985 it is noted that Mieszko came to help the Saxons in their fight against some Slavic forces, presumably the Polabians</span>

				<span class='text'>ccording to Thietmar and other contemporary chronicles the gift given by Mieszko to the Emperor was a camel</span>
				<span class='text'>The meeting consolidated the Polish-German alliance, with Mieszko joining Otto's expedition against a Slavic land, which ''together they wholly devastated (</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> with fire and tremendous depopulation''</span>
				<span class='text'>It is not clear which Slavic territory was invaded</span>
				<span class='text'>Perhaps another raid against the Polabians took place</span>
				<span class='text'>But there are indications that it was an expedition against the Czechs, Mieszko's first against his southern neighbors</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The issue of the incorporation of [[Lesser Poland]] is also not completely resolved</span>
				<span class='text'>Possibly Mieszko took the region before 990, which is indicated by the vague remark of Thietmar, who wrote of a country taken by Mieszko from Boleslav</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In light of this theory, the conquest of Lesser Poland could be a reason for the war, or its first stage</span>

				<span class='text'>Buko, ''Małopolska &quot;czeska&quot; i Małopolska &quot;polańska&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that the Czech rule over Lesser Poland was only nominal and likely limited to the indirect control of [[Kraków]] and perhaps a few other important centers</span>
				<span class='text'>This theory is based on the lack of archaeological discoveries, which would indicate major building investments undertaken by the Bohemian state</span>
				<span class='text'>esser Poland supposedly after its incorporation had become the partition of the country assigned to Mieszko's oldest son, [[Bolesław I Chrobry|Bolesław]], which is indirectly indicated in the chronicle of Thietmar</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Thietmari chronicon'', vol</span>

				<span class='text'>176</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Some historians, on the basis of the chronicle of [[Cosmas of Prague]], believe that the conquest of the lands around the lower Vistula River took place after Mieszko's death, specifically in 999</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;In favor: G</span>
				<span class='text'>Labuda, ''Mieszko I'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>172–173</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; There is also a theory according to which during this transition period Lesser Poland was governed by [[Bolesław I Chrobry|Bolesław Chrobry]], whose authority was granted to him by the Bohemian duke</span>

				<span class='text'>V&lt;/ref&gt;===Dagome iudex==={{Main|Dagome iudex}}At the end of his life (ca</span>
				<span class='text'>991-92), Mieszko I, together with his wife [[Oda of Haldensleben|Oda]] and their sons, issued a document called ''[[Dagome iudex]]'', where the Polish ruler placed his lands under the protection of the Pope and described their borders</span>
				<span class='text'>Only a later imprecise summary of the document has been preserved</span>
				<span class='text'>here are two main theories concerning reasons behind the issuing of ''Dagome iudex'':*According to the first theory the document was an effort to transform the existing missionary bishopric into a regular organization of the Catholic Church, that would cover all of Mieszko's state</span>
				<span class='text'>This understanding implies that the arrangement led to payment by Poland of [[Peter's Pence]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;This theory has been presented in various forms by historians, including Robert Holtzmann, Stanisław Zakrzewski (''Najdawniejsza bulla'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>21–23) and Henryk Łowmiański (''Początki Polski'', vol</span>
				<span class='text'>V, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>602–603)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;*The second theory assumes that the document was created in order to protect the interests of Mieszko's second wife Oda and their sons (who were named in the document) after Mieszko's death</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Bolesław I Chrobry|Bolesław]], Mieszko's eldest son, whose mother was [[Dobrawa]], was not named in the document</span>

				<span class='text'>193–195</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; However, one of Mieszko's and Oda's sons, Świętopełk, also was not mentioned</span>
				<span class='text'>'Dagome iudex'' is of capital importance for [[History of Poland|Polish history]] because it gives a general description of the Polish state's geographical location at the end of Mieszko's reign</span>

				<span class='text'>In 991 he arrived at a gathering in [[Quedlinburg]], where he participated in the customary exchange of gifts with Otto III and Empress Theophanu</span>

				<span class='text'>It's not certain that the Cathedral had already been built before Mieszko's death, and the first mention of this as his burial place comes only from the chronicles of [[Jan Długosz]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In 1836–1837 a [[cenotaph]] was built for Mieszko I and his successor Bolesław I the Brave in the Golden Chapel ({{lang-pl|Złota Kaplica}}) at the Poznań Cathedral, where the damaged remains found in the 14th century tomb of Bolesław were placed</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to Thietmar Mieszko I divided his state before his death among a number of princes</span>

				<span class='text'>The ruler managed to create an army composed of about 3,000 mounted warriors</span>
				<span class='text'>This increasingly powerful force allowed the Polans to attack weaker neighboring tribes and conquer their lands</span>
				<span class='text'>A key factor promoting cohesion of the growing state was fear of the invaders impressed by them among local populations</span>
				<span class='text'>The first Piasts reinforced their rule by burning local strongholds and replacing them with new larger fortresses, located in strategic positions</span>
				<span class='text'>Archaeological studies show that this practice was abandoned only at the end of Mieszko's reign, when his position was already well-established</span>
				<span class='text'>he largest social group in Mieszko's state were free [[peasant]]s (''kmiecie''), who cultivated their own land</span>
				<span class='text'>They had to support the state by levies collected from them and by supporting the duke and his attendants as he traveled around the country</span>
				<span class='text'>There were also service villages, specializing in production of certain types of items</span>
				<span class='text'>any trade routes went through the Polish lands, which facilitated the development of trade</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Amber]], fur and salt (extracted in [[Kuyavia]] and around [[Kołobrzeg]]) were exported to other countries, while cloth, crafts, tools and ornaments were imported</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;According to S</span>
				<span class='text'>Suchodolski, the monetary system was installed by Mieszko I's grandson and namesake, Mieszko II Lambert</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;* At the end of his rule, Mieszko I left to his sons a territory at least twice as large as what he inherited from his father</span>
				<span class='text'>The most significant were the additions of [[Silesia]], [[West Pomeranian Voivodeship|Western Pomerania]], and probably [[Lesser Poland]] including [[Kraków]]</span>
				<span class='text'> The first ruler conducted efficient foreign policy, which included agreements with [[Germany]], [[Bohemia]] and [[Sweden]], and prudently used his military resources</span>

				<span class='text'>Nothing is known for sure of any children from these relationships</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[Oswald Balzer]] (''Genealogy of the Piasts'', Kraków 1895) stated that Mieszko I had at least one son born from a pagan wife</span>
				<span class='text'>The theory was based on the allegation that Mieszko's son, who was to be placed by order of Otto I in 973 as a hostage after the Imperial Diet of Quedlinburg, couldn't be Bolesław I the Brave because he was too young</span>
				<span class='text'>This argument is refuted by Jan Widajewicz (''Czy Bolesław Chrobry był w młodości zakładnikiem u Niemców?'', ''Roczniki Historyczne'', vol</span>
				<span class='text'>XVI, 1947, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>243–250)</span>
				<span class='text'>Modern historians have no doubts that the Polish prince who was placed as the imperial hostage was Bolesław I</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In 965, before his baptism, Mieszko married [[Dobrawa of Bohemia|Dobrawa]] (b</span>
				<span class='text'>940/45 – d</span>
				<span class='text'>977), daughter of [[Boleslaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Boleslav I the Cruel]], Duke of [[Bohemia]]</span>

				<span class='text'>1016), married first to [[Eric VI of Sweden|Eric the Victorious]], King of [[Sweden]] and later to [[Sweyn Forkbeard]], King of [[Denmark]]</span>
				<span class='text'>From her second marriage, she probably was the mother of [[Cnut the Great]], King of Denmark, [[Norway]] and [[England]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Some researchers,&lt;ref name=&quot;academia</span>
				<span class='text'>du&quot;/&gt; comparing Scandinavian, Polish and German sources state it was [[Gunhild]] who was the daughter of Mieszko I and Oda (not Dobrawa) and who became wife of [[Sweyn Forkbeard]], king of [[Denmark]], [[England]], and parts of [[Norway]], mother of [[Cnut the Great]], king of [[Denmark]], [[England]], [[Norway]] and parts of [[Sweden]] (the Anglo-Scandinavian or North Sea Empire), as well as Harald and [[Świętosława]]</span>
				<span class='text'>She was also the grandmother of [[Gunhild]], the wife of [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to one hypothesis there was another daughter of Mieszko, married to a Pomeranian Slavic Prince; she could be a daughter of Dobrawa or of one of the previous pagan wives</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;According to one theory, this unnamed daughter of Mieszko I and her Pomeranian husband were the parents of [[Zemuzil, Duke of Pomerania]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Also, a theory exists (apparently based on Thietmar and supported by [[Oswald Balzer]] in 1895) that [[Vladivoj, Duke of Bohemia|Vladivoj]], who ruled as Duke of [[Bohemia]] in 1002–1003, was a son of Mieszko and Dobrawa</span>
