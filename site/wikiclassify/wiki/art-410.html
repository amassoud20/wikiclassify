				<span class='text'>He is remembered for his innovative work in all three: in theatre, most notably ''[[Caesar (Mercury Theatre)|Caesar]]'' (1937), a [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] adaptation of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''; in radio, the 1938 broadcast &quot;[[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|The War of the Worlds]]&quot;, one of the most famous in the history of radio; and in film, ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941), consistently ranked as one of the [[List of films considered the best|all-time greatest films]]</span>
				<span class='text'>elles directed a number of high-profile stage productions for the [[Federal Theatre Project]] in his early twenties, including an innovative [[Voodoo Macbeth|adaptation of ''Macbeth'']] with an entirely African American cast, and the political musical ''[[The Cradle Will Rock]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1937 he and [[John Houseman]] founded the [[Mercury Theatre]], an independent [[repertory theatre]] company that presented an acclaimed series of productions on Broadway through 1941</span>

				<span class='text'>is first film was ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941), which he co-wrote, produced, directed, and starred in as [[Charles Foster Kane]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Welles was an outsider to the [[studio system]] and directed only 13 full-length films in his career</span>
				<span class='text'>Because of this, he struggled for creative control from the [[major film studio]]s, and his films were either heavily edited or remained unreleased</span>
				<span class='text'>His distinctive directorial style featured layered and [[nonlinear narrative]] forms, innovative uses of [[lighting]] such as [[chiaroscuro]], unusual camera angles, sound techniques borrowed from radio, [[deep focus]] shots, and [[long take]]s</span>
