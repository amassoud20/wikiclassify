				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|250px|Jerome Kern, 1930s]]'''Jerome David Kern''' (January 27, 1885 – November 11, 1945) was an American [[composer]] of [[musical theatre]] and popular music</span>
				<span class='text'> One of the most important American theatre composers of the early 20th century, he wrote more than 700 songs, used in over 100 stage works, including such classics as &quot;[[Ol' Man River]]&quot;, &quot;[[Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man]]&quot;, &quot;[[A Fine Romance (song)|A Fine Romance]]&quot;, &quot;[[Smoke Gets in Your Eyes]]&quot;, &quot;[[All the Things You Are]]&quot;, &quot;[[The Way You Look Tonight]]&quot;, &quot;[[Long Ago (and Far Away)]]&quot; and &quot;[[Who? (song)|Who?]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'> He collaborated with many of the leading librettists and lyricists of his era, including [[George Grossmith Jr</span>
				<span class='text'>], [[Guy Bolton]], [[P</span>
				<span class='text'>G</span>
				<span class='text'>Wodehouse]], [[Otto Harbach]], [[Oscar Hammerstein II]], [[Dorothy Fields]], [[Johnny Mercer]], [[Ira Gershwin]] and [[E</span>

				<span class='text'>Harburg]]</span>
				<span class='text'> native [[New York City|New Yorker]], Kern created dozens of [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musicals and [[musical films|Hollywood films]] in a career that lasted for more than four decades</span>
				<span class='text'>His musical innovations, such as 4/4 dance rhythms and the employment of syncopation and [[jazz]] progressions, built on, rather than rejected, earlier musical theatre tradition</span>
				<span class='text'>He and his collaborators also employed his melodies to further the action or develop characterization to a greater extent than in the other musicals of his day, creating the model for later musicals</span>
				<span class='text'>Although dozens of Kern's musicals and [[musical film]]s were hits, only ''[[Show Boat]]'' is now regularly revived</span>
				<span class='text'>Songs from his other shows, however, are still frequently performed and adapted</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Kern detested jazz arrangements of his songs, many have been adopted by jazz musicians to become [[jazz standard|standard tune]]s</span>

				<span class='text'>It is a staple of stock productions and has been revived numerous times on Broadway and in London</span>
				<span class='text'> A 1946 revival integrated choreography into the show, in the manner of a [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] production, as did the 1994 [[Harold Prince]]–[[Susan Stroman]] revival, which was nominated for ten [[Tony Awards]], winning five, including best revival</span>
				<span class='text'>It was the first musical to enter a major opera company's repertory (New York City Opera, 1954), and the rediscovery of the 1927 score with [[Robert Russell Bennett]]'s original orchestrations led to a large-scale [[EMI Classics|EMI]] recording in 1987 and several opera-house productions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=grove/&gt; In 1941, the conductor [[Artur Rodziński]] wished to commission a symphonic suite from the score, but Kern considered himself a songwriter and not a symphonist</span>
				<span class='text'>He never orchestrated his own scores, leaving that to musical assistants, principally Frank Saddler (until 1921) and Russell Bennett (from 1923)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=grove/&gt; In response to the commission, Kern oversaw an arrangement by Charles Miller and Emil Gerstenberger of numbers from the show into the orchestral work ''Scenario for Orchestra: Themes from Show Boat'', premiered in 1941 by the [[Cleveland Orchestra]] conducted by Rodziński</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;&lt;ref name=baker/&gt;Kern's last Broadway show in the 1920s was ''[[Sweet Adeline (musical)|Sweet Adeline]]'' (1929), with a libretto by Hammerstein</span>
				<span class='text'> It was a period piece, set in the Gay 90s, about a girl from [[Hoboken, New Jersey]] (near Kern's childhood home), who becomes a Broadway star</span>
				<span class='text'> Opening just before the stock market crash, it received rave reviews, but the elaborate, old-fashioned piece was a step back from the innovations in ''Show Boat'', or even the Princess Theatre shows</span>
