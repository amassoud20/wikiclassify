				<span class='text'>name Bell Labs acknowledgement  Shannons mouse appears to have been the first artificial learning device of its kind</span>
				<span class='text'>name Bell Labs acknowledgement In 1950 Shannon published a paper on  entitled Programming a Computer for Playing Chess</span>
				<span class='text'>It describes how a machine or computer could be made to play a reasonable game of </span>
				<span class='text'>His process for having the computer decide on which move to make is a  procedure based on an  of a given chess position</span>
				<span class='text'>Shannon gave a rough example of an evaluation function in which the value of the black position was subtracted from that of the white position</span>
				<span class='text'>Material was counted according to the usual  1 point for a pawn 3 points for a knight or bishop 5 points for a rook and 9 points for a queen</span>
				<span class='text'> He considered some positional factors subtracting ½ point for each s  and </span>
				<span class='text'>Another positional factor in the evaluation function was  adding 0</span>
				<span class='text'> point for each legal move available</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally he considered  to be the capture of the king and gave the king the artificial value of 200 points</span>
				<span class='text'>Quoting from the paperThe coefficients </span>

				<span class='text'>Checkmate has been artificially included here by giving the king the large value 200 anything greater than the maximum of all other terms would do</span>
