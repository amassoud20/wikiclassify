				<span class='text'>n this work, Shannon proved that [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] and [[binary arithmetic]] could be used to simplify the arrangement of the [[electromechanical]] [[relay]]s that were used then in [[public switched telephone network|telephone call routing switches]]</span>

				<span class='text'>n 1945, as the war was coming to an end, the NDRC was issuing a summary of technical reports as a last step prior to its eventual closing down</span>
				<span class='text'>Inside the volume on fire control a special essay titled ''Data Smoothing and Prediction in Fire-Control Systems'', coauthored by Shannon, [[Ralph Beebe Blackman]], and [[Hendrik Wade Bode]], formally treated the problem of smoothing the data in fire-control by analogy with &quot;the problem of separating a signal from interfering noise in communications systems</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In other words, it modeled the problem in terms of [[Data processing|data]] and [[signal processing]] and thus heralded the coming of the [[Information Age]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; At the close of the war, he prepared a classified memorandum for Bell Telephone Labs entitled &quot;A Mathematical Theory of Cryptography,&quot; dated September 1945</span>
				<span class='text'>A declassified version of this paper was published in 1949 as &quot;[[Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems]]&quot; in the ''[[Bell System Technical Journal]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>This paper incorporated many of the concepts and mathematical formulations that also appeared in his ''[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Shannon said that his wartime insights into communication theory and cryptography developed simultaneously and that &quot;they were so close together you couldn’t separate them&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;quoted in Kahn, ''The Codebreakers'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>744</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In a footnote near the beginning of the classified report, Shannon announced his intention to &quot;develop these results </span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;While he was at Bell Labs, Shannon proved that the [[cryptographic]] [[one-time pad]] is unbreakable in his classified research that was later published in October 1949</span>
				<span class='text'>He also proved that any unbreakable system must have essentially the same characteristics as the one-time pad: the key must be truly random, as large as the plaintext, never reused in whole or part, and be kept secret</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Later on in the American [[Venona project]], a supposed &quot;one-time pad&quot; system by the [[Soviets]] was partially broken by the [[National Security Agency]], but this was because of misuses of the one-time pads by Soviet cryptographic technicians in the United States and Canada</span>
				<span class='text'>The Soviet technicians made the mistake of using the same pads more than once sometimes, and this was noticed by American [[cryptanalyst]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>==Postwar contributions===In 1948, the promised memorandum appeared as &quot;[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]&quot;, an article in two parts in the July and October issues of the ''Bell System Technical Journal''</span>
				<span class='text'>This work focuses on the problem of how best to encode the [[information]] a sender wants to transmit</span>
				<span class='text'>In this fundamental work he used tools in probability theory, developed by [[Norbert Wiener]], which were in their nascent stages of being applied to communication theory at that time</span>
				<span class='text'>Shannon developed [[information entropy]] as a measure for the uncertainty in a message while essentially inventing the field of [[information theory]]</span>
				<span class='text'>he book, co-authored with [[Warren Weaver]], ''The Mathematical Theory of Communication'', reprints Shannon's 1948 article and Weaver's popularization of it, which is accessible to the non-specialist</span>
				<span class='text'>Warren Weaver pointed out that the word [[information]] in communication theory is not related to what you do say, but to what you could say</span>
				<span class='text'>That is, information is a measure of one's freedom of choice when one selects a message</span>
				<span class='text'>Shannon's concepts were also popularized, subject to his own proofreading, in [[John Robinson Pierce]]'s ''Symbols, Signals, and Noise''</span>
				<span class='text'>nformation theory's fundamental contribution to [[natural language processing]] and [[computational linguistics]] was further established in 1951, in his article &quot;Prediction and Entropy of Printed English&quot;, showing upper and lower bounds of entropy on the statistics of English – giving a statistical foundation to language analysis</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, he proved that treating [[Whitespace (computer science)|whitespace]] as the 27th letter of the alphabet actually lowers uncertainty in written language, providing a clear quantifiable link between cultural practice and probabilistic cognition</span>
				<span class='text'>nother notable paper published in 1949 is &quot;[[Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems]]&quot;, a declassified version of his wartime work on the mathematical theory of [[cryptography]], in which he proved that all theoretically unbreakable ciphers must have the same requirements as the [[one-time pad]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He is also credited with the introduction of [[Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem|sampling theory]], which is concerned with representing a continuous-time signal from a (uniform) discrete set of samples</span>
				<span class='text'>This theory was essential in enabling telecommunications to move from analog to digital transmissions systems in the 1960s and later</span>

				<span class='text'>He also invented many devices, including rocket-powered [[flying disc]]s, a motorized [[pogo stick]], and a flame-throwing trumpet for a science exhibition{{Citation needed|reason=Septober 2010|date=January 2010}}</span>
				<span class='text'>One of his more humorous devices was a box kept on his desk called the &quot;[[Useless machine|Ultimate Machine]]&quot;, based on an idea by [[Marvin Minsky]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Otherwise featureless, the box possessed a single switch on its side</span>
				<span class='text'>When the switch was flipped, the lid of the box opened and a mechanical hand reached out, flipped off the switch, then retracted back inside the box</span>
				<span class='text'>Renewed interest in the &quot;Ultimate Machine&quot; has emerged on [[YouTube]] and [[MakerBot Industries|Thingiverse]]</span>

				<span class='text'>He continued to serve on the MIT faculty until 1978</span>
				<span class='text'>To commemorate his achievements, there were celebrations of his work in 2001, and there are currently six statues of Shannon sculpted by [[Eugene L</span>

				<span class='text'>NG|thumb|Shannon and his famous [[electromechanical]] mouse ''Theseus'' (named after [[Theseus]] from Greek mythology) which he tried to have solve the maze in one of the first experiments in [[artificial intelligence]]</span>
				<span class='text'>]===Shannon's mouse===Theseus, created in 1950, was a magnetic mouse controlled by a relay circuit that enabled it to move around a [[maze]] of 25 squares</span>
				<span class='text'>Its dimensions were the same as those of an average mouse</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bell Labs acknowledgement&quot;/&gt; The maze configuration was flexible and it could be modified at will</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bell Labs acknowledgement&quot;/&gt; The mouse was designed to search through the corridors until it found the target</span>
				<span class='text'>Having travelled through the maze, the mouse would then be placed anywhere it had been before and because of its prior experience it could go directly to the target</span>
				<span class='text'>If placed in unfamiliar territory, it was programmed to search until it reached a known location and then it would proceed to the target, adding the new knowledge to its memory thus learning</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bell Labs acknowledgement&quot;/&gt; Shannon's mouse appears to have been the first artificial learning device of its kind</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bell Labs acknowledgement&quot;/&gt;===Shannon's computer chess program===In 1950, Shannon published a paper on [[computer chess]] entitled ''Programming a Computer for Playing Chess''</span>
				<span class='text'>It describes how a machine or computer could be made to play a reasonable game of [[chess]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His process for having the computer decide on which move to make is a [[minimax]] procedure, based on an [[evaluation function]] of a given chess position</span>
				<span class='text'>Shannon gave a rough example of an evaluation function in which the value of the black position was subtracted from that of the white position</span>
				<span class='text'>''Material'' was counted according to the usual [[chess piece relative value]] (1 point for a pawn, 3 points for a knight or bishop, 5 points for a rook, and 9 points for a queen)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Artificial dreams: the quest for non-biological intelligence | author = Hamid Reza Ekbia | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-521-87867-8 | page = 46 | publisher = Cambridge University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; He considered some positional factors, subtracting ½ point for each [[doubled pawn]]s, [[backward pawn]], and [[isolated pawn]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Another positional factor in the evaluation function was ''[[mobility (chess)|mobility]]'', adding 0</span>
				<span class='text'> point for each legal move available</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally, he considered [[checkmate]] to be the capture of the king, and gave the king the artificial value of 200 points</span>
				<span class='text'>Quoting from the paper::The coefficients </span>
				<span class='text'> and </span>
				<span class='text'> are merely the writer's rough estimate</span>
				<span class='text'>Furthermore, there are many other terms that should be included</span>
				<span class='text'>The formula is given only for illustrative purposes</span>
				<span class='text'>Checkmate has been artificially included here by giving the king the large value 200 (anything greater than the maximum of all other terms would do)</span>
				<span class='text'>he evaluation function is clearly for illustrative purposes, as Shannon stated</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, according to the function, pawns that are doubled as well as isolated would have no value at all, which is clearly unrealistic</span>
