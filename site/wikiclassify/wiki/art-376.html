				<span class='text'>'' (April 3, 1924 – July 1, 2004) was an American actor, film director, and activist</span>
				<span class='text'>He is credited with helping to popularize the [[Stanislavski's system|Stanislavski system of acting]]</span>
				<span class='text'>A [[cultural icon]], Brando is most famous for his [[Academy Award]]-winning performances as Terry Malloy in ''[[On the Waterfront]]'' (1954) and [[Vito Corleone]] in ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972), as well as influential performances in ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'' (1951), ''[[Viva Zapata!]]'' (1952), ''[[Julius Caesar (1953 film)|Julius Caesar]]'' (1953), ''[[The Wild One]]'' (1953), ''[[Reflections in a Golden Eye (film)|Reflections in a Golden Eye]]'' (1967), ''[[Last Tango in Paris]]'' (1972), and ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' (1979)</span>
				<span class='text'>Brando was also an [[activism|activist]] for many causes, notably the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|African-American Civil Rights Movement]] and various [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] movements</span>
				<span class='text'>e initially gained acclaim and an Academy Award nomination for reprising the role of [[Stanley Kowalski]] in the 1951 film adaptation of [[Tennessee Williams]]' play ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'', a role that he had originated successfully on [[Broadway theater|Broadway]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He received further praise for his performance as Terry Malloy in ''On the Waterfront'', and his portrayal of the rebel motorcycle gang leader Johnny Strabler in ''The Wild One'' proved to be a lasting image in popular culture</span>
				<span class='text'>Brando received Academy Award nominations for playing [[Emiliano Zapata]] in ''Viva Zapata!''; [[Mark Antony]] in [[Joseph L</span>
				<span class='text'>Mankiewicz]]'s 1953 [[Julius Caesar (1953 film)|film adaptation]] of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''; and Air Force Major Lloyd Gruver in ''[[Sayonara]]'' (1957), an adaption of [[James Michener]]'s 1954 novel</span>

				<span class='text'>he 1960s proved to be a fallow decade for Brando</span>
				<span class='text'>He directed and starred in the [[cult film|cult]] western film ''[[One-Eyed Jacks]]'', a critical and commercial flop, after which he delivered a series of box-office failures, beginning with the [[Mutiny on the Bounty (1962 film)|1962 film adaptation]] of the novel ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty (novel)|Mutiny on the Bounty]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>After 10 years, during which he did not appear in a successful film, he won his second Academy Award for playing Vito Corleone in [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s ''The Godfather'', a role critics consider among his greatest</span>
				<span class='text'>''The Godfather'' was then one of the most commercially successful films of all time</span>
				<span class='text'>With that and his Oscar-nominated performance in ''Last Tango in Paris'', Brando re-established himself in the ranks of top box-office stars, placing sixth and tenth in the Money Making Stars poll in 1972 and 1973, respectively</span>
				<span class='text'>Brando took a four-year hiatus before appearing in ''[[The Missouri Breaks]]'' (1976)</span>
				<span class='text'>After this, he was content with being a highly paid [[character actor]] in glorified [[Cameo appearance|cameo roles]], such as in ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' (1978) and ''[[The Formula (1980 film)|The Formula]]'' (1980), before taking a nine-year break from motion pictures</span>

				<span class='text'>He finished out the 1970s with his controversial performance as [[Colonel Kurtz]] in another Coppola film, ''Apocalypse Now'', a box-office hit for which he was highly paid and which helped finance his career layoff during the 1980s</span>

				<span class='text'>He was confined to his room, but sneaked into town and was caught</span>
				<span class='text'>The faculty voted to expel him, though he was supported by the students, who thought expulsion was too harsh</span>
				<span class='text'>He was invited back for the following year, but decided instead to drop out of high school</span>

				<span class='text'>In a 1988 documentary, ''Marlon Brando: The Wild One'', Brando's sister Jocelyn remembered, &quot;He was in a school play and enjoyed it&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>So he decided he would go to New York and study acting because that was the only thing he had enjoyed</span>
				<span class='text'>That was when he was 18</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; In the A&amp;E ''Biography'' episode on Brando, George Englund said Brando fell into acting in New York because &quot;he was accepted there</span>
				<span class='text'>He wasn't criticized</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Brando was an avid student and proponent of [[Stella Adler]], from whom he learned the techniques of the [[Stanislavski System]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This technique encouraged the actor to explore his own feelings and past experiences to fully realize the character being portrayed</span>
				<span class='text'>Brando's remarkable insight and sense of realism was evident early on</span>
				<span class='text'>Adler used to recount that when teaching Brando, she had instructed the class to act like chickens, and added that a nuclear bomb was about to fall on them</span>
				<span class='text'>Most of the class clucked and ran around wildly, but Brando sat calmly and pretended to lay an egg</span>

				<span class='text'>He never taught me anything</span>
				<span class='text'>He would have claimed credit for the sun and the moon if he believed he could get away with it</span>
				<span class='text'>He was an ambitious, selfish man who exploited the people who attended the Actors Studio and tried to project himself as an acting oracle and guru</span>
				<span class='text'>Some people worshipped him, but I never knew why</span>
				<span class='text'>I sometimes went to the Actors Studio on Saturday mornings because [[Elia Kazan]] was teaching, and there were usually a lot of good-looking girls, but Strasberg never taught me acting</span>

				<span class='text'>Brando established a pattern of erratic, insubordinate behavior in the few shows he had  been in</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In 1945, Brando's agent recommended he take a co-starring role in ''The Eagle Has Two Heads'' with [[Tallulah Bankhead]], produced by Jack Wilson</span>
				<span class='text'>Tallulah had turned down the role of Blanche Dubois in a ''A Streetcar Named Desire'', which Williams had written for her, to tour the play for the 1946-1947 season</span>
				<span class='text'>Bankhead recognized Brando's potential, despite her disdain (which most Broadway veterans shared) for method acting, and agreed to hire him even though he auditioned poorly</span>
				<span class='text'>The two clashed greatly during the pre-Broadway tour, with Bankhead reminding Brando of his mother, being her age and also having a drinking problem</span>
				<span class='text'>ack Wilson was largely tolerant of Brando's behavior, but he reached his limit when Brando mumbled through a dress rehearsal shortly before the November 28, 1946, opening</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;I don't care what your grandmother did,&quot; Wilson exclaimed, &quot;and that Method stuff, I want to know what you're going to do!&quot; Brando in turn raised his voice, and acted with great power and passion</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;It was marvelous,&quot; a cast member recalled</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Everybody hugged him and kissed him</span>
				<span class='text'>He came ambling offstage and said to me, ‘They don't think you can act unless you can yell</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; A review of Brando's performance in the opening assessed that Brando was &quot;still building his character, but at present fails to impress&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>One Boston critic remarked of Brando's prolonged death scene, &quot;Brando looked like a car in midtown Manhattan searching for a parking space</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He received better reviews at subsequent tour stops, but what his colleagues recalled was only occasional indications of the talent he would later demonstrate</span>

				<span class='text'>&quot;He was a great young actor when he wanted to be, but most of the time I couldn't even hear him on the stage</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Brando displayed his apathy for the production by demonstrating some shocking onstage manners</span>
				<span class='text'>He &quot;tried everything in the world to ruin it for her&quot;, Tallulah's stage-manager claimed</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;He nearly drove her crazy: scratching his crotch, picking his nose, doing anything</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; After several weeks on the road, they reached Boston, by which time Tallulah was ready to dismiss him</span>
				<span class='text'>This proved to be one of the greatest blessings of his career, as it freed him up to play the role of [[Stanley Kowalski]] in [[Tennessee Williams]]'s 1947 play ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|A Streetcar Named Desire]],'' directed by [[Elia Kazan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Bankhead had recommended him to Williams for the role of Stanley, thinking he was perfect for the part</span>
				<span class='text'>ierpont writes that [[John Garfield]] was first choice for the role, but &quot;made impossible demands&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>It was Kazan's decision to fall back on the far less experienced (and technically too young for the role) Brando</span>
				<span class='text'>In a letter dated August 29, 1947, Williams confided to his agent Audrey Wood: &quot;It had not occurred to me before what an excellent value would come through casting a very young actor in this part</span>
				<span class='text'>It humanizes the character of Stanley in that it becomes the brutality and callousness of youth rather than a vicious old man&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>A new value came out of Brando's reading which was by far the best reading I have ever heard</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Brando based his portrayal of Kowalski on the boxer [[Rocky Graziano]], whom he had studied at a local gymnasium</span>
				<span class='text'>Graziano did not know who Brando was, but attended the production with tickets provided by the young man</span>
				<span class='text'>He said, &quot;The curtain went up and on the stage is that son of a bitch from the gym, and he's playing me</span>

				<span class='text'>He spent a month in bed at the Birmingham Army Hospital in [[Van Nuys, Los Angeles|Van Nuys]] to prepare for the role</span>
				<span class='text'>''The New York Times'' reviewer [[Bosley Crowther]] wrote that Brando as Ken&quot;is so vividly real, dynamic and sensitive that his illusion is complete&quot; and noted, &quot;Out of stiff and frozen silences he can lash into a passionate rage with the tearful and flailing frenzy of a taut cable suddenly cut</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;By Brando's own account, it may have been because of this film that his draft status was changed from 4-F to 1-A</span>
				<span class='text'>He had had surgery on his trick knee, and it was no longer physically debilitating enough to incur exclusion from the draft</span>
				<span class='text'>When Brando reported to the induction center, he answered a questionnaire by saying his [[Race (human classification)|race]] was &quot;human&quot;, his color was &quot;Seasonal–oyster white to beige&quot;, and he told an Army doctor that he was psychoneurotic</span>
				<span class='text'>When the draft board referred him to a psychiatrist, Brando explained that he had been expelled from military school and had severe problems with authority</span>

				<span class='text'>The film was directed by Elia Kazan and co-starred [[Anthony Quinn]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In the biopic ''Marlon Brando: The Wild One'', Sam Shaw says, &quot;Secretly, before the picture started, he went to Mexico to the very town where Zapata lived and was born in and it was there that he studied the speech patterns of people, their behavior, movement</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Most critics focused on the actor rather than the film, with ''Time'' and ''Newsweek'' publishing rave reviews</span>
				<span class='text'>ears later, in his autobiography, Brando remarked: &quot;Tony Quinn, whom I admired professionally and liked personally, played my brother, but he was extremely cold to me while we shot that picture</span>
				<span class='text'>During our scenes together, I sensed a bitterness toward me, and if I suggested a drink after work, he either turned me down or else was sullen and said little</span>
				<span class='text'>Only years later did I learn why</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Brando related that, to create on-screen tension between the two, &quot;Gadg&quot; (Kazan) had told Quinn—who had taken over the role of Stanley Kowalski on Broadway after Brando had finished—that Brando had been unimpressed with his work</span>
				<span class='text'>After achieving the desired effect, Kazan never told Quinn that he had misled him</span>
				<span class='text'>It was only many years later, after comparing notes, that Brando and Quinn realized the deception</span>
				<span class='text'>rando's next film, ''[[Julius Caesar (1953 movie)|Julius Caesar]]'' (1953), received highly favorable reviews</span>
				<span class='text'>Brando portrayed [[Mark Antony]]</span>
				<span class='text'>While most acknowledged Brando's talent, some critics felt Brando's &quot;mumbling&quot; and other idiosyncrasies betrayed a lack of acting fundamentals and, when his casting was announced, many remained dubious about his prospects for success</span>
				<span class='text'>Directed by [[Joseph L</span>
				<span class='text'>Mankiewicz]] and co-starring British stage actor [[John Gielgud]], Brando delivered an impressive performance, especially during Antony's noted &quot;Friends, Romans, countrymen&amp;nbsp;</span>

				<span class='text'>Gielgud was so impressed that he offered Brando a full season at the Hammersmith Theatre, an offer he declined</span>
				<span class='text'>In his biography on the actor, Stefan Kanfer writes, &quot;Marlon's autobiography devotes one line to his work on that film: Among all those British professionals, 'for me to walk onto a movie set and play Mark Anthony was asinine'—yet another example of his persistent self-denigration, and wholly incorrect</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Kanfer adds that after a screening of the film, director John Huston commented, &quot;Christ! It was like a furnace door opening—the heat came off the screen</span>
				<span class='text'>I don't know another actor who could do that</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} During the filming of ''Julius Caesar'', Brando learned that Elia Kazan had cooperated with congressional investigators, naming a whole string of &quot;subversives&quot; to the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]]</span>
				<span class='text'>By all accounts, Brando was upset by his mentor's decision, but he worked with him again in ''On The Waterfront''</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;None of us is perfect,&quot; he later wrote in his memoir, &quot;and I think that Gadg has done injury to others, but mostly to himself</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}In 1953, Brando also starred in ''[[The Wild One]]'', riding his own [[Triumph Thunderbird]] 6T motorcycle</span>
				<span class='text'>Triumph's importers were ambivalent at the exposure, as the subject matter was rowdy motorcycle gangs taking over a small town</span>
				<span class='text'>The film was criticized for its perceived gratuitous violence at the time, with ''Time'' stating, &quot;The effect of the movie is not to throw light on the public problem, but to shoot adrenaline through the moviegoer's veins</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Brando allegedly did not see eye to eye with the Hungarian director [[László Benedek]] and did not get on with costar [[Lee Marvin]]</span>

				<span class='text'>After the movie's release, the sales of [[leather jacket]]s and blue [[jeans]] skyrocketed</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Reflecting on the movie in his autobiography, Brando concluded that it had not aged very well but said:{{quote|More than most parts I've played in the movies or onstage, I related to Johnny, and because of this, I believe I played him as more sensitive and sympathetic than the script envisioned</span>

				<span class='text'>According to biographer Stefan Kanfer, the director believed that Sinatra, who grew up in [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], would work as Malloy, but eventually producer [[Sam Spiegel]] wooed Brando to the part, signing him for $100,000</span>

				<span class='text'>His performance, spurred on by his rapport with Eva Marie Saint and Kazan's direction, was praised as a ''tour de force''</span>
				<span class='text'>For the famous ''I coulda been a contender'' scene, he convinced Kazan that the scripted scene was unrealistic</span>
				<span class='text'>Schulberg's script had Brando acting the entire scene with his character being held at gunpoint by his brother Charlie, played by [[Rod Steiger]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Brando insisted on gently pushing away the gun, saying that Terry would never believe that his brother would pull the trigger and doubting that he could continue his speech while fearing a gun on him</span>
				<span class='text'>Kazan let Brando improvise and later expressed deep admiration for Brando's instinctive understanding, saying:{{quote|</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>hat was extraordinary about his performance, I feel, is the contrast of the tough-guy front and the extreme delicacy and gentle cast of his behavior</span>
				<span class='text'>What other actor, when his brother draws a pistol to force him to do something shameful, would put his hand on the gun and push it away with the gentleness of a caress?

				<span class='text'>As the decade continued, Brando remained a top box office draw but critics felt his performances were half-hearted, lacking the intensity and commitment found in his earlier work, especially in his work with Kazan</span>
				<span class='text'>He portrayed [[Napoleon]] in the 1954 film ''[[Désirée (film)|Désirée]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>According to co-star [[Jean Simmons]], Brando's contract forced him to star in the movie</span>
				<span class='text'>He put little effort into the role, claiming he didn't like the script, and later dismissed the entire movie as &quot;superficial and dismal&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Brando was especially contemptuous of director [[Henry Koster]]</span>
				<span class='text'>rando and Simmons were paired together again in the film adaptation of the musical ''[[Guys and Dolls (film)|Guys and Dolls]]'' (1955)</span>
				<span class='text'>''Guys and Dolls'' would be Brando's first and last musical role</span>
				<span class='text'>''Time'' found the picture &quot;false to the original in its feeling&quot;, remarking that Brando &quot;sings in a faraway tenor that sometimes tends to be flat</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Appearing in [[Edward Murrow]]'s ''Person to Person'' interview in early 1955, he admitted to having problems with his singing voice, which he called &quot;pretty terrible</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; In the 1965 documentary &quot;Meet Marlon Brando&quot; he revealed that the final product heard in the movie was a result of countless singing takes being cut into one and later joked, &quot;I couldn't hit a note with a baseball bat; some notes I missed by extraordinary margins&amp;nbsp;</span>

				<span class='text'>quot; Upon their first meeting Sinatra reportedly scoffed, &quot;Don't give me any of that Actors Studio shit</span>

				<span class='text'>[[Pauline Kael]] was not particularly impressed by the movie, but noted &quot;Marlon Brando starved himself to play the pixie interpreter Sakini, and he looks as if he's enjoying the stunt—talking with a mad accent, grinning boyishly, bending forward, and doing tricky movements with his legs</span>
				<span class='text'>He's harmlessly genial (and he is certainly missed when he's offscreen), though the fey, roguish role doesn't allow him to do what he's great at and it's possible that he's less effective in it than a lesser actor might have been</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; In ''[[Sayonara]]'' (1957) he appeared as a United States Air Force officer</span>
				<span class='text'>''Newsweek'' found the film a &quot;dull tale of the meeting of the twain&quot; but fans disagreed and the movie became a hit</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Stefan Kanfer's biography of the actor, Marlon's manager Jay Kanter negotiated a profitable contract with ten percent of the gross going to Brando, which put him in the millionaire category</span>
				<span class='text'>The movie was controversial due to openly discussing [[interracial marriage]] but proved a great success, earning 10 Academy Award nominations, with Brando being nominated for Best Actor</span>
				<span class='text'>The film went on to win four Academy Awards</span>
				<span class='text'>''Teahouse'' and ''Sayonara'' were the first in a string of films Brando would strive to make over the next decade which contained socially relevant messages, and he formed a partnership with Paramount to establish his own production company called Pennebaker, its declared purpose to develop films that contained &quot;social value that would improve the world</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The name was a tribute in honor of his mother, who had died in 1954</span>
				<span class='text'>By all accounts, Brando was devastated by her death, with biographer Peter Manso telling A&amp;E's ''Biography'', &quot;She was the one who could give him approval like no one else could and, after his mother died, it seems that Marlon stops caring</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Brando shocked many who knew him by appointing his hated father to run Pennebaker</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=August 2014}} In the same A&amp;E special, George Englund claims that Brando did it because &quot;it gave Marlon a chance to take shots at him, to demean and diminish him&quot; while biographer David Thomson speculates that &quot;Brando was psychologically daunted by his father</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}In 1958, Brando appeared in ''[[The Young Lions (film)|The Young Lions]]'', dyeing his hair blonde and assuming a German accent for the role, which he later admitted was not convincing</span>
				<span class='text'>It based on the novel by [[Irwin Shaw]] and Brando's portrayal of the character Christian Diestl was controversial for its time</span>
				<span class='text'>He later wrote, &quot;The original script closely followed the book, in which Shaw painted all Germans as evil caricatures, especially Christian, whom he portrayed as a symbol of everything that was bad about Nazism; he was mean, nasty, vicious, a cliché of evil&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>I thought the story should demonstrate that there are no inherently 'bad' people in the world, but they can easily be misled</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Shaw and Brando even appeared together for a televised interview with CBS correspondent [[David Schoenbrun]] and, during a bombastic exchange, Shaw charged that, like most actors, Brando was incapable of playing flat-out villainy; Brando responded by stating &quot;Nobody creates a character but an actor</span>
				<span class='text'>I play the role; now he exists</span>
				<span class='text'>He is my creation</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; ''The Young Lions'' also features Brando's only appearance in a film with friend and rival [[Montgomery Clift]] (although they shared no scenes together)</span>
				<span class='text'>Brando closed out the decade by appearing in ''[[The Fugitive Kind]]'' opposite [[Anna Magnani]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The film was based on another play by Tennessee Williams but was hardly the success ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' had been, with the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' labeling Williams's personae &quot;psychologically sick or just plain ugly&quot; and ''[[The New Yorker]]'' calling it a &quot;cornpone melodrama&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>==''One-Eyed Jacks'' and ''Mutiny on the Bounty''===In 1962, Brando made his directorial debut in the western ''[[One-Eyed Jacks]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The picture was originally planned to be directed by [[Stanley Kubrick]] from a screenplay by [[Sam Peckinpah]], but studio disputes led to their replacement by Brando and Guy Trosper</span>
				<span class='text'>Brando portrays the lead character Rio, and [[Karl Malden]] plays his partner &quot;Dad&quot; Longworth</span>
				<span class='text'>The supporting cast features [[Katy Jurado]], [[Ben Johnson (actor)|Ben Johnson]], and [[Slim Pickens]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Brando's penchant for multiple retakes and character exploration as an actor carried over into his directing, however, and the film soon went over budget; Paramount expected the film to take three months to complete but shooting stretched to six and the cost doubled to more than six million dollars</span>
				<span class='text'>Brando's inexperience as an editor also delayed postproduction and Paramount eventually took control of the film</span>
				<span class='text'>Brando later wrote, &quot;Paramount said it didn't like my version of the story; I'd had everyone lie except Karl Malden</span>

				<span class='text'>rando's revulsion with the film industry reportedly boiled over on the set of his next film, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]'s [[Mutiny on the Bounty (1962 film)|remake of ''Mutiny on the Bounty'']], which was filmed in [[Tahiti]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The actor was accused of deliberately sabotaging nearly every aspect of the production</span>
				<span class='text'>On June 16, 1962, ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' ran an article by Bill Davidson with the headline &quot;Six million dollars down the drain: the mutiny of Marlon Brando&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>''Mutiny'' director [[Lewis Milestone]] claimed that the executives &quot;deserve what they get when they give a ham actor, a petulant child, complete control over an expensive picture</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; '' Mutiny on the Bounty'' nearly capsized MGM and, while the project had indeed been hampered with delays other than Brando's behavior, the accusations would dog the actor for years as studios began to fear Brando's difficult reputation</span>
				<span class='text'>Critics also began taking note of Marlon's fluctuating weight</span>
				<span class='text'>==Box office decline: 1963–1971===Distracted by his personal life and becoming disillusioned with his career, Brando began to view acting as a means to an end financially</span>
				<span class='text'>Critics protested when he started accepting roles in films many perceived as being beneath his talent, or criticized him for failing to live up to the better roles</span>
				<span class='text'>Previously only signing short term deals with movie studios, in 1961 Brando uncharacteristically signed a five picture deal with Universal Studios that would haunt him for the rest of the decade</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[The Ugly American]]'' (1963) was the first of these films</span>
				<span class='text'>Based on the 1958 novel of the same name that Pennebaker had optioned, the movie, which featured Brando's sister Jocelyn, was rated fairly positively but died at the box office</span>
				<span class='text'>Brando was nominated for a Golden Globe for his performance</span>
				<span class='text'>All of Brando's other Universal films during this period, including ''[[Bedtime Story (1964 film)|Bedtime Story]]'' (1964), ''[[The Appaloosa]]'' (1966), ''[[A Countess from Hong Kong]]'' (1967) and ''[[The Night of the Following Day]]'' (1969), were also critical and commercial flops</span>
				<span class='text'>''Countess'' in particular was a disappointment for Brando, who had looked forward to working with one of his heroes, director [[Charlie Chaplin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The experience turned out to be an unhappy one; Brando had no chemistry with his leading lady [[Sophia Loren]] and was horrified at Chaplin's didactic style of direction and his authoritarian approach</span>
				<span class='text'>Brando had also appeared in the spy thriller ''[[Morituri (1965 film)|Morituri]]'' in 1965; that, too, failed to attract an audience</span>
				<span class='text'>rando acknowledged his professional decline, writing later, &quot;Some of the films I made during the sixties were successful; some weren't</span>
				<span class='text'>Some, like ''The Night of the Following Day'', I made only for the money; others, like ''[[Candy (1968 film)|Candy]]'', I did because a friend asked me to and I didn't want to turn him down&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>In some ways I think of my middle age as the Fuck You Years</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; ''Candy'' was especially appalling for many; a 1968 sex farce film directed by [[Christian Marquand]] and based on the 1958 novel by [[Terry Southern]], the movie satirizes pornographic stories through the adventures of its naive heroine, Candy, played by [[Ewa Aulin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It is generally regarded as the nadir of Brando's career</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[The Washington Post]]'' observed: &quot;Brando's self-indulgence over a dozen years is costing him and his public his talents</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; In the March 1966 issue of ''[[The Atlantic]]'', [[Pauline Kael]] wrote that in his rebellious days, Marlon &quot;was antisocial because he knew society was crap; he was a hero to youth because he was strong enough not to take the crap&quot; but now Brando and others like him had become &quot;buffoons, shamelessly, pathetically mocking their public reputations</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; In an earlier review of ''The Appaloosa'' in 1966, Kael wrote that the actor was &quot;trapped in another dog of a movie&amp;nbsp;</span>

				<span class='text'>Not for the first time, Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Brando gives us a heavy-lidded, adenoidally openmouthed caricature of the inarticulate, stalwart loner</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Although he feigned indifference, Brando was hurt by the critical mauling, admitting in the 2015 film ''[[Listen to Me Marlon]]'', &quot;They can hit you every day and you have no way of fighting back</span>
				<span class='text'>I was very convincing in my pose of indifference, but I was very sensitive and it hurt a lot</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;While Brando had lost much of his critical and commercial appeal in the 1960s, he still gave some memorable performances</span>
				<span class='text'>Brando portrayed a repressed gay army officer in ''[[Reflections in a Golden Eye (film)|Reflections in a Golden Eye]]'', directed by [[John Huston]] and costarring [[Elizabeth Taylor]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The role turned out as one of his greatest in years, with Stanley Crouch marveling, &quot;Brando's main achievement was to portray the taciturn but stoic gloom of those pulverized by circumstances</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The studio originally intended the movie to be a low-budget production set in contemporary times without any major actors, but the phenomenal success of the novel gave Evans the clout to turn ''The Godfather'' into a prestige picture</span>

				<span class='text'>]Jaffe eventually set three conditions for the casting of Brando: That he would have to take a fee far below what he typically received; he'd have to agree to accept financial responsibility for any production delays his behavior cost; and he had to submit to a screen test</span>
				<span class='text'>In order to skirt the humiliation of having Brando submit to a screen test, Coppola convinced Brando to a videotaped &quot;make-up&quot; test, in which Brando did his own makeup (he used cotton balls to simulate the puffed-cheek look)</span>
				<span class='text'>Coppola had feared Brando might be too young to play the Don, but was electrified by the actor's characterization as the head of a crime family</span>
				<span class='text'>Even so, he had to fight the studio in order to cast the temperamental actor</span>
				<span class='text'>Brando had doubts himself, stating in his autobiography, &quot;I had never played an Italian before, and I didn't think I could do it successfully</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Eventually, [[Charles Bluhdorn]], the president of Paramount parent [[Gulf+Western]], was won over to letting Brando have the role; when he saw the screen test, he asked in amazement, &quot;What are we watching? Who is this old guinea?&quot; Brando was signed for a low fee of $50,000, but in his contract, he was given a percentage of the gross on a sliding scale: 1% of the gross for each $10&amp;nbsp;million over a $10&amp;nbsp;million threshold, up to 5% if the picture exceeded $60&amp;nbsp;million</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Evans, Brando sold back his points in the picture for $100,000 as he was in dire need of funds</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;That $100,000 cost him $11&amp;nbsp;million,&quot; Evans claimed</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In a 1994 interview that can be found on the Academy of Achievement website, Coppola insisted, &quot;''The Godfather'' was a very unappreciated movie when we were making it</span>
				<span class='text'>They were very unhappy with it</span>
				<span class='text'>They didn't like the cast</span>
				<span class='text'>They didn't like the way I was shooting it</span>
				<span class='text'>I was always on the verge of getting fired</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; When word of this reached Brando, he threatened to walk off the picture, writing in his memoir, &quot;I strongly believe that directors are entitled to independence and freedom to realize their vision, though Francis left the characterizations in our hands and we had to figure out what to do</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; In a 2010 television interview with [[Larry King]], [[Al Pacino]] also talked about how Brando's support helped him keep the role of Michael Corleone in the movie—despite the fact director Francis Ford Coppola wanted to sack him</span>
				<span class='text'>Brando was on his best behavior during filming, buoyed by an impressive cast that included Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, [[James Caan]] and [[Diane Keaton]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In the ''Vanity Fair'' article &quot;The Godfather Wars&quot; Mark Seals writes, &quot;With the actors, as in the movie, Brando served as the head of the family</span>
				<span class='text'>He broke the ice by toasting the group with a glass of wine</span>
				<span class='text'>'When we were young, Brando was like the godfather of actors,' says Robert Duvall</span>
				<span class='text'>'I used to meet with [[Dustin Hoffman]] in Cromwell's Drugstore, and if we mentioned his name once, we mentioned it 25 times in a day</span>
				<span class='text'> Caan adds, 'The first day we met Brando everybody was in awe</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Brando's performance was glowingly reviewed by critics</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;I thought it would be interesting to play a gangster, maybe for the first time in the movies, who wasn't like those bad guys [[Edward G</span>
				<span class='text'>Robinson]] played, but who is kind of a hero, a man to be respected,&quot; Brando recalled in his autobiography</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Also, because he had so much power and unquestioned authority, I thought it would be an interesting contrast to play him as a gentle man, unlike [[Al Capone]], who beat up people with baseball bats</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Co-star Robert Duvall later marveled to A&amp;E's ''Biography'', &quot;He minimized the sense of beginning</span>
				<span class='text'>In other words he, like, deemphasized the word ''action''</span>

				<span class='text'>quot; Brando confessed in his autobiography, &quot;To this day I can't say what ''Last Tango in Paris'' was about,&quot; and added the film &quot;required me to do a lot of emotional arm wrestling with myself, and when it was finished, I decided that I wasn't ever again going to destroy myself emotionally to make a movie</span>

				<span class='text'>The movie also reunited the actor with director Arthur Penn</span>
				<span class='text'>Following ''The Godfather'' and ''Tango'', Brando's performance was disappointing for some reviewers, who accused him of giving an erratic and inconsistent performance</span>
				<span class='text'>As biographer Stefan Kanfer describes, Penn had difficulty controlling Brando, who seemed intent on going over the top with his border-ruffian-turned-contract-killer Robert E</span>
				<span class='text'>Lee Clayton: &quot;Marlon made him a cross-dressing psychopath</span>
				<span class='text'>Absent for the first hour of the movie, Clayton enters on horseback, dangling upside down, caparisoned in white buckskin, Littlefeather-style</span>

				<span class='text'>Over the next hour, also for no apparent reason, Clayton assumes the intonation of a British upper-class twit and an elderly frontier woman, complete with a granny dress and matching bonnet</span>
				<span class='text'>Penn, who believed in letting actors do their thing, indulged Marlon all the way</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Critics were unkind, with ''The Observer'' calling Brando's performance &quot;one of the most extravagant displays of ''grandedamerie'' since [[Sarah Bernhardt]]&quot;, while ''The Sun'' complained, &quot;Marlon Brando at fifty-two has the sloppy belly of a sixty-two-year-old, the white hair of a seventy-two-year-old, and the lack of discipline of a precocious twelve-year-old</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; However, Kanfer noted: &quot;Even though his late work was met with disapproval, a re-examination shows that often, in the middle of the most pedestrian scene, there would be a sudden, luminous occurrence, a flash of the old Marlon that showed how capable he remained</span>

				<span class='text'>Brando portrayed Superman's father [[Jor-El]] in the 1978 film ''Superman''</span>

				<span class='text'>quot; However, after Brando's death, the footage was reincorporated into the 2006 re-cut of the film, ''[[Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut]]'' and in the 2006 &quot;loose sequel&quot; ''[[Superman Returns]]'', in which both used and unused archive footage of him as Jor-El from the first two ''Superman'' films was remastered for a scene in the Fortress of Solitude, and Brando's voice-overs were used throughout the film</span>
				<span class='text'>As the decade wore on, Brando was criticized more and more for only accepting what amounted to cameos in exchange for huge paydays</span>

				<span class='text'>]Brando starred as [[Colonel Kurtz|Colonel Walter E</span>
				<span class='text'>Kurtz]] in Francis Ford Coppola's Vietnam epic ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' (1979)</span>
				<span class='text'>He plays a highly decorated U</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>military as much as the Vietnamese</span>
				<span class='text'>Brando was paid $1&amp;nbsp;million a week for 3 weeks work</span>
				<span class='text'>The film drew attention for its lengthy and troubled production, as [[Eleanor Coppola]]'s documentary ''Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse'' documents: Brando showed up on the set overweight, [[Martin Sheen]] suffered a heart attack, and severe weather destroyed several expensive sets</span>
				<span class='text'>The film's release was also postponed several times while Coppola edited millions of feet of footage</span>
				<span class='text'>In the documentary, Coppola talks about how astonished he was when an overweight Brando turned up for his scenes and, feeling desperate, decided to portray Kurtz, who appears emaciated in the original story, as a man who had indulged every aspect of himself</span>
				<span class='text'>Coppola: &quot;He was already heavy when I hired him and he promised me that he was going to get in shape and I imagined that I would, if he were heavy, I could use that</span>
				<span class='text'>But he was ''so'' fat, he was very, very shy about it&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>He was very, very adamant about how he didn't want to portray himself that way</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Brando admitted to Coppola that he had not read the book, ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'', as the director had asked him to, and the pair spent days exploring the story and the character of Kurtz, much to the actor's financial benefit, according to producer [[Fred Roos]]: &quot;The clock was ticking on this deal he had and we had to finish him within three weeks or we'd go into this very expensive overage&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>And Francis and Marlon would be talking about the character and whole days would go by</span>
				<span class='text'>And this is at Marlon's urging—and yet he's getting paid for it</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;Upon release, ''Apocalypse Now'' earned critical acclaim, as did Brando's performance</span>
				<span class='text'>Marlon's whispering of Kurtz's final words ''&quot;The horror! The horror!&quot;'', has become particularly famous</span>
				<span class='text'>Roger Ebert, writing in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', defended the movie's controversial ''denouement'', opining that the ending, &quot;with Brando's fuzzy, brooding monologues and final violence, feels more satisfactory than any conventional ending possibly could</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;===Later work===After appearing as oil tycoon Adam Steiffel in 1980's ''[[The Formula (1980 film)|The Formula]]'', which was poorly received critically, Brando announced his retirement from acting</span>
				<span class='text'>However he returned in 1989 in ''[[A Dry White Season]],'' based on [[André Brink]]'s 1979 [[anti-apartheid]] novel</span>
				<span class='text'>Brando agreed to do the film for free, but fell out with director [[Euzhan Palcy]] over how the film was edited; he even made a rare television appearance in an interview with [[Connie Chung]] to voice his disapproval</span>
				<span class='text'>In his memoir, he maintained that Palcy &quot;had cut the picture so poorly, I thought, that the inherent drama of this conflict was vague at best</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Brando received praise for his performance, earning an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor and winning the Best Actor Award at the Tokyo Film Festival</span>
				<span class='text'>Brando also scored enthusiastic reviews for his caricature of his Vito Corleone role as Carmine Sabatini in 1990's ''[[The Freshman (1990 film)|The Freshman]]</span>
				<span class='text'>' In his original review, Roger Ebert wrote, &quot;There have been a lot of movies where stars have repeated the triumphs of their parts—but has any star ever done it more triumphantly than Marlon Brando does in ''The Freshman''?&quot;  Variety also praised Brando's performance as Sabatini and noted, &quot;Marlon Brando's sublime comedy performance elevates ''The Freshman'' from screwball comedy to a quirky niche in film history</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Brando also starred alongside his friend [[Johnny Depp]] in the box office hit ''[[Don Juan DeMarco]]'' (1995) and in Depp's controversial ''[[The Brave]]'' (1997), which was never released in the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>Later performances, such as his appearance in ''[[Christopher Columbus: The Discovery]]'' (1992) (for which he won a [[Golden Raspberry Awards|Raspberry]] as &quot;Worst Supporting Actor&quot;), ''[[The Island of Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreau (1996 film)|The Island of Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreau]]'' (in which he was nominated for another &quot;Worst Actor&quot; Raspberry) (1996), and his barely recognizable appearance in ''[[Free Money (film)|Free Money]]'' (1998), resulted in some of the worst reviews of his career</span>
				<span class='text'>However, his last film, ''[[The Score (2001 film)|The Score]]'' (2001), was received generally positively</span>
				<span class='text'>In the film, in which he portrays a fence, he starred with [[Robert De Niro]], who had portrayed Vito Corleone in ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Brando conceived the idea of a novel called ''Fan-Tan'' with director [[Donald Cammell]] in 1979, which was not released until 2005</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Final years and death==Brando's notoriety, his troubled family life, and his [[obesity]] attracted more attention than his late acting career</span>
				<span class='text'>He gained a great deal of weight in the 1960s and by the early to mid-1990s he weighed over 300&amp;nbsp;lbs (136&amp;nbsp;kg) and suffered from [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|Type 2 diabetes]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He had a history of weight fluctuation throughout his career that, by and large, he attributed to his years of stress-related overeating followed by compensatory dieting</span>
				<span class='text'>He also earned a reputation for being difficult on the set, often unwilling or unable to memorize his lines and less interested in taking direction than in confronting the film director with odd demands</span>
				<span class='text'>e also dabbled with some innovation in his last years</span>
				<span class='text'>He had several patents issued in his name from the [[U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Patent and Trademark Office]], all of which involve a method of tensioning drum heads, in June 2002 – November 2004</span>
				<span class='text'>(For example, see {{US Patent|6812392}} and its equivalents)</span>
				<span class='text'>n 2004, Brando recorded for the character Mrs</span>
				<span class='text'>Sour in the unreleased animated film ''[[Big Bug Man]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>he actor was a longtime close friend of entertainer [[Michael Jackson]] and paid regular visits to his [[Neverland Ranch]], resting there for weeks at a time</span>
				<span class='text'>Brando also participated in the singer's two-day solo career 30th-anniversary celebration concerts in 2001, and starred in his 13-minute-long music video, &quot;[[You Rock My World]],&quot; in the same year</span>
				<span class='text'>On Jackson's 30th anniversary concert, Brando gave a rambling speech to the audience on humanitarian work which received a poor reaction and was unaired</span>
				<span class='text'>he actor's son, Miko, was Jackson's bodyguard and assistant for several years, and was a friend of the singer</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Views on acting===Brando was notoriously reluctant to discuss acting in interviews,{{cn|date=December 2015}} but many of his insights are on record</span>
				<span class='text'>In his autobiography ''Songs My Mother Taught Me'', Brando observed:{{quote|I've always thought that one benefit of acting is that it gives actors a chance to express feelings that they are normally unable to vent in real life</span>
				<span class='text'>Intense emotions buried inside you can come smoking out the back of your head, and I suppose in terms of psychodrama this can be helpful</span>
				<span class='text'>In hindsight, I guess my emotional insecurity as a child—the frustrations of not being allowed to be who I was, of wanting love and not being able to get it, of realizing that I was of no value—may have helped me as an actor, at least in a small way</span>
				<span class='text'>It probably gave me a certain intensity that most people don't have</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Brando|Lindsey|1994}}{{Full citation needed|date=December 2015}}}}He also confessed that, while having great admiration for the theater, he did not return to it after his initial success primarily because the work left him drained emotionally:{{quote|What I remember most about ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' was the emotional grind of acting in it six nights and two afternoons</span>
				<span class='text'>Try to imagine what it was like walking on stage at 8:30 every night having to yell, scream, cry, break dishes, kick the furniture, punch the walls and ''experience'' the same intense, wrenching emotions night after night, trying each time to evoke in audiences the same emotions I felt</span>
				<span class='text'>It was exhausting</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Brando|Lindsey|1994}}{{Full citation needed|date=December 2015}}}}Brando repeatedly credited Stella Adler and her understanding of the Stanislavsky acting technique for bringing realism to American cinema, but also added:{{quote|This school of acting served the American theater and motion pictures well, but it was restricting</span>
				<span class='text'>The American theater has never been able to present Shakespeare or classical drama of any kind satisfactorily</span>
				<span class='text'>We simply do not have the style, the regard for the language or the cultural disposition </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>You cannot mumble in Shakespeare</span>
				<span class='text'>You cannot improvise, and you are required to adhere strictly to the text</span>
				<span class='text'>The English theater has a sense of language that we do not recognize </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>In the United States the English language has developed almost into a patois</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Brando|Lindsey|1994}}{{Full citation needed|date=December 2015}}}}In the 2015 documentary ''Listen to Me Marlon'', Brando shared his thoughts on playing a death scene, stating, &quot;That's a tough scene to play</span>
