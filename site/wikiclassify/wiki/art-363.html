				<span class='text'>While working in a factory as part of the [[Second World War|war effort]] in 1944, she met a photographer and began a successful [[pin-up model]]ing career</span>
				<span class='text'>The work led to two short-lived film contracts with [[20th Century Fox|Twentieth Century-Fox]] (1946–47) and [[Columbia Pictures]] (1948)</span>
				<span class='text'>After a series of minor film roles, she signed a new contract with Fox in 1951</span>
				<span class='text'>Over the next two years, she became a popular actress with roles in several comedies, including ''[[As Young as You Feel]]'' and ''[[Monkey Business (1952 film)|Monkey Business]]'', and in the dramas ''[[Clash by Night]]'' and ''[[Don't Bother to Knock]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Monroe faced a scandal when it was revealed that she had posed for nude photos before becoming a star, but rather than damaging her career, the story increased interest in her films</span>
				<span class='text'>y 1953, Monroe was one of the most bankable Hollywood stars, with leading roles in three films: the [[film noir|noir]] ''[[Niagara (1953 film)|Niagara]]'', which focused on her sex appeal, and the comedies ''[[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953 film)|Gentlemen Prefer Blondes]]'' and ''[[How to Marry a Millionaire]]'', which established her star image as a &quot;dumb blonde&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Although she played a significant role in the creation and management of her public image throughout her career, she was disappointed at being [[typecasting (acting)|typecast]] and underpaid by the studio</span>
				<span class='text'>She was briefly suspended in early 1954 for refusing a film project, but returned to star in one of the biggest box office successes of her career, ''[[The Seven Year Itch]]'' (1955)</span>
				<span class='text'>When the studio was still reluctant to change her contract, Monroe founded a film production company in late 1954, Marilyn Monroe Productions (MMP)</span>
				<span class='text'>She dedicated 1955 to building her company and began studying [[method acting]] at the [[Actors Studio]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In late 1955, Fox gave her a new contract, which gave her more control and a larger salary</span>
				<span class='text'>After giving a critically acclaimed performance in ''[[Bus Stop (1956 film)|Bus Stop]]'' (1956) and acting in the first independent production of MMP, ''[[The Prince and the Showgirl]]'' (1957), she won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Golden Globe for Best Actress]] for ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' (1959)</span>
				<span class='text'>Her last completed film was the drama ''[[The Misfits (film)|The Misfits]]'' (1961)</span>
				<span class='text'>onroe's troubled private life received much attention</span>
				<span class='text'>She struggled with addiction, depression, and anxiety</span>
				<span class='text'>She had two highly publicized marriages, to baseball player [[Joe DiMaggio]] and playwright [[Arthur Miller]], which both ended in divorce</span>
				<span class='text'>She died at the age of 36 from an overdose of [[barbiturate]]s at her home in Los Angeles on August 5, 1962</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Banner|2012|p=238}} The comparison was partly prompted by Monroe, who named Harlow as her childhood idol, wanted to play her in a biopic, and even employed Harlow's hair stylist to color her hair</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfnm|1a1=Churchwell|1y=2004|1p=25|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=246–250}} Her publicity stunts often revolved around her clothing exposing large amounts of her body or even malfunctioning, such as when one of the shoulder straps of her dress suddenly snapped during a press conference</span>

				<span class='text'>In ''[[How to Marry a Millionaire]]'' (1953), one of the films that portrayed Monroe as a sexually attractive and naïve &quot;dumb blonde&quot;]]According to Dyer, Monroe became &quot;virtually a household name for sex&quot; in the 1950s and &quot;her image has to be situated in the flux of ideas about morality and sexuality that characterised the fifties in America&quot;, such as [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]ian ideas about sex, the [[Kinsey Reports|Kinsey report]] (1953), and [[Betty Friedan]]'s ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'' (1963)</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnm|1a1=Dyer|1y=1986|1p=21|2a1=Dyer|2y=1991|2p=58}} According to him, Monroe's star image was created mainly for the [[male gaze]] as characterized in film roles where she generally played &quot;the girl&quot;, who is defined solely by her gender</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Dyer|1986|pp=19, 20}} Her roles were almost always chorus girls, secretaries, or models; occupations where &quot;the woman is on show, there for the pleasure of men</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Dyer|1986|pp=19, 20}} Dyer also sees Monroe as the first sex symbol to combine &quot;naturalness&quot; and sexuality, in contrast to the 1940s ''femme fatales''</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Dyer|1986|pp=29–39}} This alleged artlessness and lack of shame about her sexuality was closely linked to her image as a dumb and vulnerable woman</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Dyer|1986|pp=29–39}} According to Norman Mailer, &quot;Marilyn suggested sex might be difficult and dangerous with others, but ice cream with her</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Dyer|1986|p=39}} Similarly, [[Molly Haskell]] has written that &quot;she was the fifties fiction, the lie that a woman had no sexual needs, that she is there to cater to, or enhance, a man's needs</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Haskell|1991|p=256}} She has also stated that before her death, Monroe was less popular with women than with men, as they &quot;couldn't identify with her and didn't support her&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Dyer|1986|p=57, quoting Haskell}}The importance of blondness to Monroe's star image has also been analyzed by film historians</span>
				<span class='text'>Dyer has argued that platinum blonde hair became such a defining feature of her because it made her &quot;racially unambiguous&quot; and exclusively white, and that she should be seen as emblematic of racism in twentieth-century popular culture</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Dyer|1986|p=40}} Lois Banner agrees that it may not to be a coincidence that Monroe launched a trend of platinum blonde actresses at the same time as the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1954–68)|Civil Rights Movement]] was beginning, but has also criticized Dyer, pointing out that in her highly publicized private life Monroe associated with people who were seen as &quot;[[white ethnic]]s&quot;, such as Joe DiMaggio ([[Italian-American]]) and Arthur Miller (Jewish)</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Banner|2012|pp=254–256}} According to Banner, she sometimes challenged prevailing racial norms in her publicity photographs; for example, in an image featured in ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' in 1951, she was shown in revealing clothes while practicing with [[African-American]] singing coach [[Phil Moore (jazz musician)|Phil Moore]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Banner|2012|p=184}}In addition to being a sex symbol, Monroe was perceived as a specifically American star, &quot;a national institution as well known as hot dogs, apple pie, or baseball&quot; according to ''Photoplay''</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Banner|2012|p=8}} Historian Fiona Handyside writes that the French female audiences associated whiteness/blondness with American modernity and cleanliness, and so Monroe came to symbolize a modern, &quot;liberated&quot; woman whose life takes place in the public sphere</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Handyside|2010|pp=1–16}} Film historian [[Laura Mulvey]] has written of her as an endorsement for American consumer culture:{{quote|If America was to export the democracy of glamour into post-war, impoverished Europe, the movies could be its shop window&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Marilyn Monroe, with her all American attributes and streamlined sexuality, came to epitomise in a single image this complex interface of the economic, the political, and the erotic</span>
				<span class='text'>By the mid 1950s, she stood for a brand of classless glamour, available to anyone using American cosmetics, nylons and peroxide</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Handyside|2010|p=2, quoting Mulvey}}}}To profit from Monroe's popularity, 20th Century-Fox cultivated several lookalike actresses, including Jayne Mansfield and [[Sheree North]]</span>
