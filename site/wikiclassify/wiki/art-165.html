				<span class='text'>k}}}}'''Enid Mary Blyton''' (11 August 1897&amp;nbsp;– 28 November 1968) was an English [[List of children's literature authors|children's writer]] whose books have been among the world's best-sellers since the 1930s, selling more than 600 million copies</span>
				<span class='text'>Blyton's books are still enormously popular, and have been translated into almost 90 languages; her first book, ''[[Child Whispers]]'', a 24-page collection of poems, was published in 1922</span>
				<span class='text'>She wrote on a wide range of topics including education, natural history, fantasy, mystery stories and biblical narratives, and is best remembered today for her [[Noddy (character)|Noddy]], [[The Famous Five (series)|Famous Five]], and [[The Secret Seven|Secret Seven]] series</span>
				<span class='text'>ollowing the commercial success of her early novels such as ''[[The Wishing Chair (series)|Adventures of the Wishing Chair]]'' (1937) and ''[[The Enchanted Wood (novel)|The Enchanted Wood]]'' (1939), Blyton went on to build a literary empire, sometimes producing fifty books a year in addition to her prolific magazine and newspaper contributions</span>
				<span class='text'>Her writing was unplanned and sprang largely from her unconscious mind; she typed her stories as events unfolded before her</span>
				<span class='text'>The sheer volume of her work and the speed with which it was produced led to rumours that Blyton employed an army of ghost writers, a charge she vigorously denied</span>
				<span class='text'>lyton's work became increasingly controversial among literary critics, teachers and parents from the 1950s onwards, because of the alleged unchallenging nature of her writing and the themes of her books, particularly the Noddy series</span>
				<span class='text'>Some libraries and schools banned her works, which the [[BBC]] had refused to broadcast from the 1930s until the 1950s because they were perceived to lack literary merit</span>
				<span class='text'>Her books have been criticised as being [[elitism|elitist]], [[sexism|sexist]], [[racism|racist]], [[xenophobia|xenophobic]] and at odds with the more liberal environment emerging in post-war Britain, but they have continued to be best-sellers since her death in 1968</span>
				<span class='text'>lyton felt she had a responsibility to provide her readers with a strong moral framework, so she encouraged them to support worthy causes</span>
				<span class='text'>In particular, through the clubs she set up or supported, she encouraged and organised them to raise funds for animal and [[paediatric]] charities</span>
				<span class='text'>The story of Blyton's life was dramatised in a BBC film entitled ''[[Enid (film)|Enid]]'', featuring [[Helena Bonham Carter]] in the title role and first broadcast in the United Kingdom on [[BBC Four]] in 2009</span>
				<span class='text'>There have also been several adaptations of her books for stage, screen and television</span>
				<span class='text'>=Early life and education==Enid Blyton was born on 11 August 1897 in [[East Dulwich]], London, the eldest of three children, to Thomas Carey Blyton (1870–1920), a [[cutlery]] salesman, and his wife Theresa Mary ({{née}} Harrison; 1874–1950)</span>
				<span class='text'>Enid's younger brothers, Hanly (1899–1983) and Carey (1902–1976), were born after the family had moved to a semi-detached villa in [[Beckenham]], then a village in [[Kent]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{r|EBSChrono}} A few months after her birth Enid almost died from [[whooping cough]], but was nursed back to health by her father, whom she adored</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Baverstock|1997|p=5|ps=}} Thomas Blyton ignited Enid's interest in nature; in her autobiography she wrote that he &quot;loved flowers and birds and wild animals, and knew more about them than anyone I had ever met&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Blyton|1952|p=54|ps=}} He also passed on his interest in gardening, art, music, literature and the theatre, and the pair often went on nature walks, much to the disapproval of Enid's mother, who showed little interest in her daughter's pursuits</span>
				<span class='text'>{r|EBSBio}} Enid was devastated when he left the family shortly after her thirteenth birthday to live with another woman</span>
				<span class='text'>Enid and her mother did not have a good relationship, and she failed to attend either of her parents' funerals</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Thompson|Keenan|2006|p=77|ps=}}From 1907 to 1915 Blyton attended St Christopher's School in Beckenham, where she enjoyed physical activities and became school tennis champion and captain of [[lacrosse]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Druce|1992|p=9|ps=}} She was not so keen on all the academic subjects but excelled in writing, and in 1911 she entered [[Arthur Mee]]'s children's poetry competition</span>
				<span class='text'>Mee offered to print her verses, encouraging her to produce more</span>
				<span class='text'>{r|EBSChrono}} Blyton's mother considered her efforts at writing to be a &quot;waste of time and money&quot;, but she was encouraged to persevere by Mabel Attenborough, the aunt of a school friend</span>
				<span class='text'>{r|EBSBio}}[[File:Seckford Hall - geograph</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|[[Seckford Hall]] in [[Woodbridge, Suffolk|Woodbridge]], Suffolk, was an inspiration to Blyton with its haunted room, secret passageway and sprawling gardens</span>
				<span class='text'>]Blyton's father taught her to play the piano, which she mastered well enough for him to believe that she might follow in his sister's footsteps and become a professional musician</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Druce|1992|p=9|ps=}} Blyton considered enrolling at the [[Guildhall School of Music]], but decided she was better suited to becoming a writer</span>
				<span class='text'>{r|ODNB}} After finishing school in 1915 as [[Head girl and head boy|head girl]], she moved out of the family home to live with her friend Mary Attenborough, before moving in with George and Emily Hart at [[Seckford Hall]] in [[Woodbridge, Suffolk|Woodbridge]] in [[Suffolk]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Seckford Hall, with its allegedly haunted room and secret passageway provided inspiration for her later writing</span>
				<span class='text'>{r|EBSChrono}} At Woodbridge Congregational Church Blyton met Ida Hunt, who taught at [[Ipswich High School (Suffolk)|Ipswich High School]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Hunt invited Blyton to move to her farmhouse near Woodbridge, and suggested that she train as a teacher</span>
				<span class='text'>{r|EBSChrono}} Blyton was introduced to the children at the nursery school, and recognising her natural affinity with them she enrolled in a [[National Froebel Foundation|National Froebel Union]] teacher training course at the school in September 1916</span>
				<span class='text'>{r|ODNB}}{{r|BhimaniEdu}} By this time she had almost ceased contact with her family</span>
				<span class='text'>{r|EBSChrono}}Blyton's manuscripts had been rejected by publishers on many occasions, which only made her more determined to succeed: &quot;it is partly the struggle that helps you so much, that gives you determination, character, self-reliance&amp;nbsp;– all things that help in any profession or trade, and most certainly in writing&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>In March 1916 her first poems were published in ''Nash's Magazine''</span>
				<span class='text'>{r|EBSWriter}} She completed her teacher training course in December 1918, and the following month obtained a teaching appointment at Bickley Park School, a small independent establishment for boys in [[Bickley]], Kent</span>
				<span class='text'>Two months later Blyton received a teaching certificate with distinctions in zoology and principles of education, 1st class in botany, geography, practice and history of education, child hygiene and class teaching and 2nd class in literature and elementary mathematics</span>
				<span class='text'>{r|EBSChrono}} In 1920 she moved to Southernhay in Hook Road [[Surbiton]] as nursery governess to the four sons of architect Horace Thompson and his wife Gertrude,{{r|ODNB}} with whom Blyton spent four happy years</span>
				<span class='text'>Owing to a shortage of schools in the area her charges were soon joined by the children of neighbours, and a small school developed at the house</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Stoney|2011|loc=552|ps=}}==Early writing career=={{details|Enid Blyton bibliography|works by Enid Blyton}}In 1920 Blyton relocated to [[Chessington]], and began writing in her spare time</span>
				<span class='text'>The following year she won the ''Saturday Westminster Review'' writing competition with her essay &quot;On the Popular Fallacy that to the Pure All Things are Pure&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Stoney|2011|loc=624–630|ps=}} Publications such as ''[[The Londoner]]'', ''Home Weekly'' and ''[[The Bystander]]'' began to show an interest in her short stories and poems</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|''[[Child Whispers]]'' (1922)]]Blyton's first book, ''[[Child Whispers]]'', a 24-page collection of poems, was published in 1922</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Stoney|2011|loc=624–630|ps=}} It was illustrated by a schoolfriend, [[Phyllis Chase]], who collaborated on several of her early works</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Stoney|2011|loc=645|ps=}} Also in that year Blyton began writing in annuals for [[Cassell (publisher)|Cassell]] and [[George Newnes]], and her first piece of writing was accepted for publication in ''[[Teachers' World]]'', &quot;Peronei and his Pot of Glue&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Her success was boosted in 1923 when her poems were published alongside those of [[Rudyard Kipling]], [[Walter de la Mare]] and [[G</span>

				<span class='text'>Chesterton]] in a special issue of ''Teachers' World''</span>
				<span class='text'>Blyton's educational texts were quite influential in the 1920s and '30s, her most sizeable being the three-volume ''The Teacher's Treasury'' (1926), the six-volume ''Modern Teaching'' (1928), the ten-volume ''Pictorial Knowledge'' (1930), and the four-volume ''Modern Teaching in the Infant School'' (1932)</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Rudd|2004|p=112|ps=}}In July 1923 Blyton published ''Real Fairies'', a collection of thirty-three poems written especially for the book with the exception of &quot;Pretending&quot;, which had appeared earlier in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine</span>
				<span class='text'>{r|RealFairies}} The following year she published ''The Enid Blyton Book of Fairies'',  illustrated by Horace J</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Stoney|2011|loc=3810|ps=}}In the 1930s Blyton developed an interest in writing stories related to various myths, including those of [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome|Rome]]; ''The Knights of the Round Table'', ''Tales of Ancient Greece'' and ''Tales of Robin Hood'' were published in 1930</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''Tales of Ancient Greece'' Blyton retold sixteen well-known ancient Greek myths, but used the Latin rather than the Greek names of deities and invented conversations between the characters</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Brazouski|Klatt|1994|p=25|ps=}} ''The Adventures of Odysseus'', ''Tales of the Ancient Greeks and Persians'' and ''Tales of the Romans'' followed in 1934</span>

				<span class='text'>''[[The Enchanted Wood (novel)|The Enchanted Wood]]'', the first book in the [[The Faraway Tree|Faraway Tree series]], published in 1939, is about a magic tree inspired by the [[Norse mythology]] that had fascinated Blyton as a child</span>
				<span class='text'>{r|ODNB}} According to Blyton's daughter Gillian the inspiration for the magic tree came from &quot;thinking up a story one day and suddenly she was walking in the enchanted wood and found the tree</span>
				<span class='text'>In her imagination she climbed up through the branches and met Moon-Face, Silky, the Saucepan Man and the rest of the characters</span>
				<span class='text'>She had all she needed</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{r|Herald06}} As in the Wishing-Chair series, these fantasy books typically involve children being transported into a magical world in which they meet [[fairy|fairies]], [[goblins]], [[elves]], [[pixie]]s and other mythological creatures</span>
				<span class='text'>lyton's first full-length adventure novel, ''The Secret Island'', was published in 1938, featuring the characters of Jack, Mike, Peggy and Nora</span>
				<span class='text'>{r|SecretIsland}} Described by ''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Glasgow Herald]]'' as a &quot;[[Robinson Crusoe]]-style adventure on an island in an English lake&quot;, ''The Secret Island'' was a lifelong favourite of Gillian's and spawned the [[The Secret Series (Enid Blyton)|Secret series]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{r|Herald06}} The following year Blyton released her first book in the [[The Circus Series|Circus series]]{{sfnp|Stoney|2011|loc=4096|ps=}} and her initial book in the [[Amelia Jane]] series, ''Naughty Amelia Jane!''{{sfnp|Stoney|2011|loc=4102|ps=}} According to Gillian the main character was based on a large handmade doll given to her by her mother on her third birthday</span>
				<span class='text'>{r|Herald06}}During the 1940s Blyton became a prolific author, her success enhanced by her &quot;marketing, publicity and branding that was far ahead of its time&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{r|Telegraph09}} In 1940 Blyton published two books&amp;nbsp;– ''Three Boys and a Circus'' and ''Children of Kidillin''&amp;nbsp;– under the pseudonym of Mary Pollock (middle name plus first married name),{{sfnp|Bluemel|2009|p=209|ps=}} in addition to the eleven published under her own name that year</span>
				<span class='text'>So popular were Pollock's books that one reviewer was prompted to observe that &quot;Enid Blyton had better look to her laurels&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Stoney|2011|loc=1937–1944|ps=}} But Blyton's readers were not so easily deceived and many complained about the subterfuge to her and her publisher,{{sfnp|Stoney|2011|loc=1937–1944|ps=}} with the result that all six books published under the name of Mary Pollock&amp;nbsp;– two in 1940 and four in 1943&amp;nbsp;– were reissued under Blyton's name</span>
				<span class='text'>{r|MaryPollock}} Later in 1940 Blyton published the first of her [[boarding school story]] books and the first novel in the [[The Naughtiest Girl|Naughtiest Girl]] series, ''[[The Naughtiest Girl in the School]]'', which followed the exploits of the mischievous schoolgirl Elizabeth Allen at the fictional Whyteleafe School</span>

				<span class='text'>Its popularity resulted in twenty-one books between then and 1963, and the characters of Julian, Dick, Anne, George (Georgina) and Timmy the dog became household names in Britain</span>
				<span class='text'>{r|Household}} Matthew Grenby, author of ''Children's Literature'', states that the five were involved with &quot;unmasking hardened villains and solving serious crimes&quot;, although the novels were &quot;hardly 'hard-boiled' thrillers&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Grenby|2008|p=170|ps=}} Blyton based the character of Georgina, a [[tomboy]] she described as &quot;short-haired, freckled, sturdy, and snub-nosed&quot; and &quot;bold and daring, hot-tempered and loyal&quot;, on herself</span>

				<span class='text'>Her declining health and a falling off in readership among older children have been put forward as the principal reasons for this change in trend</span>

				<span class='text'>Blyton had &quot;thought it was made up of every experience she'd ever had, everything she's seen or heard or read, much of which had long disappeared from her conscious memory&quot; but never knew the direction her stories would take</span>
				<span class='text'> Blyton further explained in her biography that &quot;If I tried to think out or invent the whole book, I could not do it</span>
				<span class='text'>For one thing, it would bore me and for another, it would lack the 'verve' and the extraordinary touches and surprising ideas that flood out from my imagination</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{r|Herald06}}Blyton's daily routine varied little over the years</span>
				<span class='text'>She usually began writing soon after breakfast, with her portable typewriter on her knee and her favourite red Moroccan shawl nearby; she believed that the colour red acted as a &quot;mental stimulus&quot; for her</span>
				<span class='text'>Stopping only for a short lunch break she continued writing until five o'clock, by which time she would usually have produced 6,000–10,000 words</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Stoney|2011|loc=1859|ps=}}A 2000 article in ''[[The Malay Mail]]'' considers Blyton's children to have &quot;lived in a world shaped by the realities of post-war austerity&quot;, enjoying freedom without the political correctness of today, which serves modern readers of Blyton's novels with a form of escapism</span>
				<span class='text'>{r|MM00}} Brandon Robshaw of ''The Independent'' refers to the Blyton universe as  &quot;crammed with colour and character&quot;, &quot;self-contained and internally consistent&quot;, noting that Blyton exemplifies a strong mistrust of adults and figures of authority in her works, creating a world in which children govern</span>
				<span class='text'>{r|Ind04}} Gillian noted that in her mother's adventure, detective and school stories for older children, &quot;the hook is the strong storyline with plenty of cliffhangers, a trick she acquired from her years of writing serialised stories for children's magazines</span>

				<span class='text'>{r|NoddyBBC}}Victor Watson, Assistant Director of Research at [[Homerton College, Cambridge]], believes that Blyton's works reveal an &quot;essential longing and potential associated with childhood&quot;, and notes how the opening pages of ''The Mountain of Adventure'' present a &quot;deeply appealing ideal of childhood&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Watson|2000|p=88|ps=}} He argues that Blyton's work differs from that of many other authors in its approach, describing the narrative of The Famous Five series for instance as &quot;like a powerful spotlight, it seeks to illuminate, to explain, to demystify</span>
				<span class='text'>It takes its readers on a roller-coaster story in which the darkness is always banished; everything puzzling, arbitrary, evocative is either dismissed or explained&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Watson further notes how Blyton often used minimalist visual descriptions and introduced a few careless phrases such as &quot;gleamed enchantingly&quot; to appeal to her young readers</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Watson|2000|p=89|ps=}}From the mid-1950s rumours began to circulate that Blyton had not written all the books attributed to her, a charge she found particularly distressing</span>

				<span class='text'>{r|EBSChrono}} The librarian was eventually forced to make a public apology in open court early the following year, but the rumours that Blyton operated &quot;a 'company' of ghost writers&quot; persisted, as some found it difficult to believe that one woman working alone could produce such a volume of work</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Stoney|2011|loc=2645|ps=}}==Charitable work==Blyton felt a responsibility to provide her readers with a positive moral framework, and she encouraged them to support worthy causes</span>
				<span class='text'>{r|BiographicalEncyclopedia}} Her view, expressed in a 1957 article, was that children should help animals and other children rather than adults:{{quote|[children] are not interested in helping adults; indeed, they think that adults themselves should tackle adult needs</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Stoney|2011|loc=2219–2225|ps=}}}}Blyton and the members of the children's clubs she promoted via her magazines raised a great deal of money for various charities; according to Blyton, membership of her clubs meant &quot;working for others, for no reward&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The largest of the clubs she was involved with was the Busy Bees, the junior section of the [[People's Dispensary for Sick Animals]], which Blyton had actively supported since 1933</span>
				<span class='text'>The club had been set up by [[Maria Dickin]] in 1934,{{r|Timeline}} and after Blyton publicised its existence in the ''Enid Blyton Magazine'' it attracted 100,000 members in three years</span>

				<span class='text'>{r|ODNB}}From the 1930s to the 1950s the BBC operated a ''de facto'' ban on dramatising Blyton's books for radio, considering her to be a &quot;second-rater&quot; whose work was without literary merit</span>

				<span class='text'>{r|Fine}} Blyton's response to her critics was that she was uninterested in the views of anyone over the age of 12, claiming that half the attacks on her work were motivated by jealousy and the rest came from &quot;stupid people who don't know what they're talking about because they've never read any of my books&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Stoney|2011|loc=2567–2573|ps=}}Although Blyton's works have been banned from more public libraries than those of any other author, there is no evidence that the popularity of her books ever suffered, and she remains very widely read</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Tucker|1990|p=7|ps=}} Although some criticised her in the 1950s for the volume of work she produced, Blyton astutely capitalised on being considered a more &quot;savoury&quot; English alternative to what was seen by contemporaries as an invasion by American culture in the form of Disney and comics</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Rudd|2004|p=112|ps=}}===Simplicity===Some librarians felt that Blyton's restricted use of language, a conscious product of her teaching background, was prejudicial to an appreciation of more literary qualities</span>
				<span class='text'>In a scathing article published in ''Encounter'' in 1958, [[Colin Welch]] remarked that it was &quot;hard to see how a diet of Miss Blyton could help with the [[Eleven plus exam|11-plus]] or even with the Cambridge English [[Tripos]]&quot;,{{r|ODNB}} but reserved his harshest criticism for Blyton's Noddy, describing him as an &quot;unnaturally priggish&amp;nbsp;</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Tucker|1990|p=116|ps=}} Fred Inglis considers Blyton's books to be technically easy to read, but to also be &quot;emotionally and cognitively easy&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He mentions that the psychologist Michael Woods believed that Blyton was different from many other older authors writing for children in that she seemed untroubled by presenting them with a world that differed from reality</span>
				<span class='text'>Woods surmised that Blyton &quot;was a child, she thought as a child, and wrote as a child&amp;nbsp;</span>

				<span class='text'>Inevitably Enid Blyton was labelled by rumour a child-hater</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfnp|Inglis|1982|p=189|ps=}} Inglis argues though that Blyton was clearly devoted to children and put an enormous amount of energy into her work, with a powerful belief in &quot;representing the crude moral diagrams and garish fantasies of a readership&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Inglis|1982|p=189|ps=}} Blyton's daughter Imogen has stated that she &quot;loved a relationship with children through her books&quot;, but real children were an intrusion, and there was no room for intruders in the world that Blyton occupied through her writing</span>
				<span class='text'>{r|Blight}}===Racism, xenophobia and sexism===Accusations of racism in Blyton's books were first made by [[Lena Jeger]] in a ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' article published in 1966, in which she was critical of Blyton's ''The Little Black Doll'', published a few months earlier</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Greenfield|1995|p=113|ps=}} The publisher [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] conducted an internal assessment of Blyton's ''The Mystery That Never Was'', submitted to them at the height of her fame in 1960</span>
				<span class='text'>The review was carried out by the author and books editor [[Phyllis Hartnoll]], in whose view &quot;There is a faint but unattractive touch of old-fashioned xenophobia in the author's attitude to the thieves; they are 'foreign'&amp;nbsp;</span>

				<span class='text'>{r|Mangan}}===Revisions to later editions===To address criticisms levelled at Blyton's work some later editions have been altered to reflect more liberal attitudes towards issues such as race, gender and the treatment of children; modern reprints of the Noddy series substitute teddy bears or goblins for [[golliwogs]], for instance</span>
				<span class='text'>{r|Geoghegan}} The golliwogs who steal Noddy's car and dump him naked in the Dark Wood in ''Here Comes Noddy Again'' are replaced by goblins in the 1986 revision, who strip Noddy only of his shoes and hat and return at the end of the story to apologise</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Druce|1992|p=230|ps=}}''[[The Faraway Tree]]'''s Dame Slap, who made regular use of corporal punishment, was changed to Dame Snap who no longer did so, and the names of Dick and Fanny in the same series were changed to Rick and Frannie</span>

				<span class='text'>References to George's short hair making her look like a boy were removed in revisions to ''[[Five on a Hike Together]]'', reflecting the idea that girls need not have long hair to be considered feminine or normal</span>
				<span class='text'>{r|MorningHerald2012}}In 2010 [[Hodder &amp; Stoughton|Hodder]], the publisher of the Famous Five series, announced its intention to update the language used in the books, of which it sold more than half a million copies a year</span>
