				<span class='text'>Pushkin himself preferred his verse novel ''[[Eugene Onegin]]'', which he wrote over the course of his life and which, starting a tradition of great Russian novels, follows a few central characters but varies widely in tone and focus</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;Onegin&quot; is a work of such complexity that, while only about a hundred pages long, translator [[Vladimir Nabokov]] needed two full volumes of material to fully render its meaning in English</span>
				<span class='text'>Because of this difficulty in translation, Pushkin's verse remains largely unknown to English readers</span>
				<span class='text'>Even so, Pushkin has profoundly influenced western writers like [[Henry James]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Musical legacy===Pushkin's works also provided fertile ground for Russian composers</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Mikhail Glinka|Glinka]]'s ''[[Ruslan and Lyudmila (opera)|Ruslan and Lyudmila]]'' is the earliest important Pushkin-inspired opera, and a landmark in the tradition of Russian music</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s operas ''[[Eugene Onegin (opera)|Eugene Onegin]]'' (1879) and ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|The Queen of Spades]]'' (1890) became perhaps better known outside of Russia than Pushkin's own works of the same name</span>
				<span class='text'>[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]'s monumental ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris Godunov]]'' (two versions, 1868-9 and 1871-2) ranks as one of the very finest and most original of Russian operas</span>
				<span class='text'>ther Russian operas based on Pushkin include [[Alexander Dargomyzhsky|Dargomyzhsky]]'s ''[[Rusalka (Dargomyzhsky)|Rusalka]]'' and ''[[The Stone Guest (Dargomyzhsky)|The Stone Guest]]''; [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s ''[[Mozart and Salieri (opera)|Mozart and Salieri]]'', ''[[The Tale of Tsar Saltan (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Tale of Tsar Saltan]]'', and ''[[The Golden Cockerel]]''; [[C√©sar Cui|Cui]]'s ''[[Prisoner of the Caucasus (opera)|Prisoner of the Caucasus]]'', ''[[Feast in Time of Plague (opera)|Feast in Time of Plague]]'', and ''[[The Captain's Daughter (opera)|The Captain's Daughter]]''; [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[Mazeppa (opera)|Mazeppa]]''; [[Rachmaninov]]'s one-act operas ''[[Aleko (opera)|Aleko]]'' (based on The Gypsies) and ''[[The Miserly Knight]]''; [[Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Mavra]]'', and [[Eduard N√°pravn√≠k|N√°pravn√≠k]]'s ''[[Dubrovsky (opera)|Dubrovsky]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>dditionally, ballets and [[cantata]]s, as well as innumerable [[Art song|songs]] have been set to Pushkin's verse (including even his French-language poems, in [[Isabelle Aboulker]]'s [[song cycle]] [[Troika (album)|&quot;Caprice √©trange&quot;]])</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Franz von Supp√©|Supp√©]], [[Ruggiero Leoncavallo|Leoncavallo]] and [[Gian Francesco Malipiero|Malipiero]],have also based operas on his works</span>

				<span class='text'>==Romanticism===Pushkin is considered by many to be the central representative of Romanticism in Russian literature, however, he can't be labelled unequivocally as a Romantic</span>
				<span class='text'>Russian critics have traditionally argued that his works represent a path from [[neo-Classicism]] through Romanticism to [[Realism (arts)|Realism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>An alternative assessment suggests that &quot;he had an ability to entertain contrarities [sic] which may seem Romantic in origin, but are ultimately subversive of all fixed points of view, all single outlooks, including the Romantic&quot; and that &quot;he is simultaneously Romantic and not Romantic&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=basker/&gt;===Influence on the Russian language===According to [[Vladimir Nabokov]], &lt;blockquote&gt;Pushkin's [[idiom]] combined all the contemporaneous elements of Russian with all he had learned from [[Gavrila Derzhavin|Derzhavin]], [[Vasily Zhukovsky|Zhukovsky]], [[Konstantin Batyushkov|Batyushkov]], [[Nikolay Karamzin|Karamzin]] and [[Ivan Krylov|Krylov]]; these elements are:# The poetical and [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] strain that still lived in [[Church Slavonic]] forms and locutions;# Abundant and natural [[gallicism]]s;# The everyday colloquialisms of his set; and# Stylized popular speech</span>
				<span class='text'>He made a salad of the famous three styles (low, medium elevation, high) dear to the pseudoclassical archaists, and added to it the ingredients of Russian romanticists with a pinch of [[parody]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Nabokov]], ''Verses and Versions'', page 72</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Pushkin is usually credited with developing Russian literature</span>
				<span class='text'>Not only is he seen as having originated the highly nuanced level of language which characterizes Russian literature after him, but he is also credited with substantially augmenting the Russian lexicon</span>
				<span class='text'>Where he found gaps in the Russian vocabulary, he devised [[calques]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His rich vocabulary and highly sensitive style are the foundation for modern Russian literature</span>
				<span class='text'>His accomplishments set new records for development of the Russian language and culture</span>
				<span class='text'>He became the father of Russian literature in the 19th century, marking the highest achievements of 18th century and the beginning of literary process of the 19th century</span>
				<span class='text'>Alexander Pushkin introduced Russia to all the European literary genres as well as a great number of West European writers</span>
				<span class='text'>He brought natural speech and foreign influences to create modern poetic Russian</span>
				<span class='text'>Though his life was brief, he left examples of nearly every literary genre of his day: lyric poetry, narrative poetry, the novel, the short story, the drama, the critical essay, and even the personal letter</span>
				<span class='text'>ushkin's work as a journalist marked the birth of Russian magazine culture which included him devising and contributing heavily to one of the most influential literary magazines of the 19th century, the Sovremennik (The Contemporary, or –°–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–∏–∫)</span>
				<span class='text'>Pushkin inspired the folk tales and genre pieces of other authors: [[Nikolai Leskov|Leskov]], [[Esenin]], and [[Maxim Gorky|Gorky]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His use of Russian language formed the basis of the style of novelists [[Ivan Turgenev]], [[Ivan Goncharov]], and [[Leo Tolstoy]], as well as that of subsequent lyric poets such as [[Mikhail Lermontov]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Pushkin was analyzed by [[Nikolai Vasilyevich Gogol]], his successor and pupil, and the great Russian critic [[Vissarion Grigoryevich Belinsky]] who has also produced the fullest and deepest critical study of Pushkin's work, which still retains much of its relevance</span>
				<span class='text'>=Honours and legacy==*In 1929, Soviet writer [[Leonid Grossman]] published a novel ''The d'Archiac Papers'', telling the story of Pushkin's death from the perspective of a French diplomat, being a participant and a witness of the fatal duel</span>
				<span class='text'>The book describes him as a liberal and a victim of the [[Tsar]]ist regime</span>
				<span class='text'>In Poland the book was published under the title ''Death of the Poet''</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1937, the town of [[Pushkin, Saint Petersburg|Tsarskoye Selo]] was renamed Pushkin in his honour</span>
				<span class='text'> There are several museums in Russia dedicated to Pushkin, including two in Moscow, one in Saint Petersburg, and a [[Mikhaylovskoye Museum Reserve|large complex]] in Mikhaylovskoye</span>
				<span class='text'>Pushkin's death was portrayed in the 2006 biographical film ''Pushkin: The Last Duel''</span>
				<span class='text'>The film was directed by [[Natalya Bondarchuk]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Pushkin was portrayed onscreen by [[Sergei Bezrukov]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Pushkin Trust was established in 1987 by the [[Alexandra Hamilton, Duchess of Abercorn|Duchess of Abercorn]] to commemorate the creative legacy and spirit of her ancestor and to release the creativity and imagination of the children of Ireland by providing them with opportunities to communicate their thoughts, feelings and experiences</span>
