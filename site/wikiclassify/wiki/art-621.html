				<span class='text'>1483</span>
				<span class='text'>He expanded the influence of the [[House of Habsburg]] through war and his marriage in 1477 to [[Mary of Burgundy]], the heiress to the [[Duchy of Burgundy]], but he also lost the Austrian territories in today's Switzerland to the [[Swiss Confederacy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>hrough marriage of his son [[Philip I of Castile|Philip the Handsome]] to eventual queen [[Joanna of Castile]] in 1498, Maximilian helped to establish the [[Habsburg Spain|Habsburg dynasty in Spain]] which allowed his grandson [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles]] to hold the thrones of both [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Since his father Philip died in 1506, Charles succeeded Maximilian as Holy Roman Emperor in 1519, and thus ruled both the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and the [[Spanish Empire]] simultaneously</span>

				<span class='text'> The reigning duke of Burgundy, [[Charles the Bold]], was the chief political opponent of Maximilian's father Frederick III</span>
				<span class='text'>Frederick was concerned about Burgundy's expansive tendencies on the western border of his [[Holy Roman Empire]] and, to forestall military conflict, he attempted to secure the marriage of Charles's only daughter, Mary of Burgundy, to his son Maximilian</span>
				<span class='text'>After the [[Siege of Neuss]] (1474–75), he was successful</span>
				<span class='text'>The wedding between Maximilian and Mary took place on the evening of 16 August 1477</span>

				<span class='text'>After the regency ended, Maximilian and Charles VIII of France exchanged these two territories for Burgundy and Picardy in the [[Treaty of Senlis]] (1493)</span>

				<span class='text'>During his first year as an Emperor, much of Austria was under Hungarian rule as they had occupied the territory under the reign of Frederick</span>

				<span class='text'>==Italian and Swiss wars===As the Treaty of Senlis had resolved French differences with the Holy Roman Empire, King [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]] of France had his borders secured in the north and turned his attention to Italy, where he made claims for the [[Duchy of Milan]]</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1513, with Henry VIII of England, Maximilian won an important victory at the [[battle of the Spurs]] against the French, stopping their advance in northern France</span>
				<span class='text'>His campaigns in Italy were not as successful and there, his progress was quickly checked</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Peter Paul Rubens 120b</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Maximilian in armour]]In the late 15th century two states, [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]] and [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavaria]], went to war</span>
				<span class='text'>Bavaria demanded money back from Tyrol that had been loaned on the collateral of Tyrolean lands</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1490, the two nations demanded that Maximilian I step in to mediate the dispute</span>
				<span class='text'>In response, he assumed the control of Tyrol and its debt</span>
				<span class='text'>Because Tyrol had no law code at this time, the nobility freely expropriated money from the populace, which caused the royal palace in [[Innsbruck]] to fester with corruption</span>
				<span class='text'>After taking control, Maximilian instituted immediate financial reform</span>
				<span class='text'>In order to symbolize his new wealth and power, he built the [[Golden Roof]], a canopy overlooking the town center of Innsbruck, from which to watch the festivities celebrating his assumption of rule over Tyrol</span>
				<span class='text'>It is made entirely from golden shingles</span>
				<span class='text'>Gaining theoretical control of Tyrol for the Habsburgs was of strategic importance because it linked the Swiss Confederacy to the Habsburg-controlled Austrian lands, which facilitated some imperial geographic continuity</span>
				<span class='text'>he situation in Italy was not the only problem Maximilian had at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>The Swiss won a decisive victory against the Empire in the [[Battle of Dornach]] on 22 July 1499</span>
				<span class='text'>Maximilian had no choice but to agree to a peace treaty signed on 22 September 1499 in [[Treaty of Basel (1499)|Basel]] that granted the [[Swiss Confederacy]] independence from the Holy Roman Empire</span>
				<span class='text'>==Reforms==={{main|Imperial Reform}}Within the Holy Roman Empire, Maximilian faced pressure from local rulers who believed that the King's continued wars with the French to increase the power of his own house were not in their best interests</span>
				<span class='text'>There was also a consensus that in order to preserve the unity of the Empire, deep reforms were needed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Oxford12/&gt; The reforms, which had been delayed for a long time, were launched in the [[1495 Reichstag]] at [[Worms, Germany|Worms]]</span>
				<span class='text'>A new organ, the ''[[Reichskammergericht]]'' was introduced, and it was to be largely independent from the Emperor</span>
				<span class='text'>To finance it, a new tax, the ''Gemeine Pfennig'' was launched</span>
				<span class='text'>However, its collection was never fully successful</span>

				<span class='text'>32-33, accessed 15 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The local rulers wanted more independence from the Emperor and a strengthening of their own territorial rule</span>
				<span class='text'>This led to Maximilian agreeing to establish an organ called the ''[[Reichsregiment]]'', which would meet in [[Nuremberg]] and consist of the deputies of the Emperor, local rulers, commoners, and the prince-electors of the Holy Roman Empire</span>
				<span class='text'>The new organ proved itself politically weak and its power returned to Maximilian in 1502</span>

				<span class='text'>]Due to the difficult external and internal situation he faced, Maximilian also felt it necessary to introduce reforms in the historic territories of the House of Habsburg in order to finance his army</span>
				<span class='text'>Using Burgundian institutions as a model, he attempted to create a unified state</span>
				<span class='text'>This was not very successful, but one of the lasting results was the creation of three different subdivisions of the Austrian lands: [[Lower Austria]], [[Upper Austria]], and [[Vorderösterreich]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=erbe/&gt;Maximilian was always troubled by financial shortcomings; his income never seemed to be enough to sustain his large-scale goals and policies</span>
				<span class='text'>For this reason he was forced to take substantial credits from Upper German banker families, especially from the families of Baumgarten, [[Fugger]] and Welser</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Jörg Baumgarten]] even served as Maximilian's financial advisor</span>
				<span class='text'>The Fuggers, who dominated the copper and silver mining business in Tyrol, provided a credit of almost 1 million gulden for the purpose of bribing the [[prince-elector]]s to choose Maximilian's grandson [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] as the new Emperor</span>
				<span class='text'>At the end of Maximilian's rule, the Habsburgs' mountain of debt totalled 6 million gulden; this corresponded to a decade's worth of tax revenues from their inherited lands</span>
				<span class='text'>It took until the end of the 16th century for this debt to be repaid</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1508, Maximilian, with the assent of [[Pope Julius II]], took the title ''Erwählter Römischer Kaiser'' (&quot;Elected Roman Emperor&quot;), thus ending the centuries-old custom that the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] had to be crowned by the pope</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Maximilian talking to German knights]]After it became clear that Maximilian's policies in [[Italy]] had been unsuccessful, and after 1517 [[Venice]] reconquered the last pieces of their territory from Maximilian, the emperor now started to focus entirely on the question of his succession</span>
				<span class='text'>His goal was to secure the throne for a member of his house and prevent [[Francis I of France]] from gaining the throne; the resulting &quot;election campaign&quot; was unprecedented due to the massive use of bribery</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Fugger]] family provided Maximilian a credit of 1 million gulden, which was used to bribe the prince-electors</span>
				<span class='text'>At first, this policy seemed successful, and Maximilian managed to secure the votes from Mainz, Cologne, Brandenburg and Bohemia for his grandson Charles V</span>
				<span class='text'>The death of Maximilian in 1519 seemed to put the succession at risk, but in a few months the election of Charles V was secured</span>
