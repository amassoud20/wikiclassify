				<span class='text'>Bing and Al continued at the Clemmer Theatre for several months often with three other men  - Wee Georgie Crittenden, Frank McBride and Lloyd Grinnell - and they were billed as 'The Clemmer Trio' or 'The Clemmer Entertainers' depending which men were used</span>

				<span class='text'>tm&lt;/ref&gt;In October 1925, Crosby and his partner [[Al Rinker]], brother of singer [[Mildred Bailey]] decided to seek fame in California and they traveled to Los Angeles where they met up with Mildred Bailey</span>
				<span class='text'>She introduced them to her show business contacts and the Fanchon and Marco Time Agency hired them for thirteen weeks to take part in a revue called The Syncopation Idea, starting at the Boulevard Theater in Los Angeles and then on the Loew's circuit</span>
				<span class='text'>They each earned $75 a week</span>
				<span class='text'> Bing and Al Rinker began as a minor part of The Syncopation Idea and it was there that they started to develop as entertainers</span>
				<span class='text'>They had a lively and individual style and they were particularly popular with college students</span>
				<span class='text'>After The Syncopation Idea closed, Bing and Al obtained work in the Will Morrissey Music Hall Revue which must have been fascinating if insecure</span>
				<span class='text'>However, their skills were further honed during their time with Morrissey and when they subsequently had the chance to present their own independent act, they blossomed and were quickly spotted by the [[Paul Whiteman]] organization</span>
				<span class='text'>At that time, it was felt that Whiteman needed something different and entertaining to break up the musical selections he was presenting and Crosby and Rinker filled this requirement admirably</span>
				<span class='text'>After less than a year in full-time show business, they had become part of one of the biggest names in the entertainment world</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;macfarlane2001&quot;/&gt; Hired for $150 a week in 1926, they made their debut with Whiteman on December 6 at the [[Tivoli Theatre (Chicago)|Tivoli Theatre]] in Chicago</span>
				<span class='text'>Their first recording, in October 1926, was &quot;I've Got the Girl&quot;, with Don Clark's Orchestra, but the Columbia-issued record did them no vocal favors, as it was inadvertently recorded at a speed slower than it should have been, which increased the singers' pitch when played at 78&amp;nbsp;rpm</span>
				<span class='text'>Throughout his career, Crosby often credited Mildred Bailey for getting him his first important job in the entertainment business</span>

				<span class='text'>tml&lt;/ref&gt;====The Rhythm Boys===={{Refimprove section|date=January 2007}}Initial successes with Whiteman were followed by disaster when they reached New York and for a while Whiteman must have thought of letting them go</span>
				<span class='text'>Possibly Bing might have been retained as Whiteman was already using him as a solo performer on record, but the prospects for Rinker must have been bleak</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the addition of pianist and aspiring songwriter [[Harry Barris]] made all the difference to the act and &quot;[[The Rhythm Boys]]&quot; were born</span>
				<span class='text'>The additional voice meant that the boys could be heard more easily in the large New York theaters and they quickly became a real success</span>
				<span class='text'>A year touring with Whiteman performing and recording with musicians [[Bix Beiderbecke]], [[Jack Teagarden]], [[Tommy Dorsey]], [[Jimmy Dorsey]], [[Eddie Lang]] and [[Hoagy Carmichael]], provided valuable experience and then they were sent out on tour alone</span>
				<span class='text'>Much has been written about the escapades of the three men during this period and clearly they were living life to the full</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite all of this, Bing was continuing to develop and when the Rhythm Boys rejoined the Whiteman troupe in 1929, he had matured considerably as a performer</span>
				<span class='text'>He was constantly in demand as a solo artist on record and radio</span>
				<span class='text'>rosby soon became the star attraction of [[the Rhythm Boys]], and in 1928 he had his first number one hit with the Whiteman orchestra, a jazz-influenced rendition of &quot;[[Ol' Man River]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1929, [[the Rhythm Boys]] appeared in the film [[The King of Jazz]] with Whiteman but Bing's growing dissatisfaction with Whiteman led to [[the Rhythm Boys]] leaving his organization</span>
				<span class='text'> They joined the [[Gus Arnheim]] Orchestra performing nightly in The [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Cocoanut Grove]] of the Ambassador Hotel</span>
				<span class='text'>Singing with the Arnheim Orchestra, Bing's solos began to steal the show, while the Rhythm Boys act gradually became redundant</span>
				<span class='text'> Harry Barris wrote several of Crosby's subsequent hits including &quot;At Your Command&quot;, &quot;[[I Surrender Dear]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Wrap Your Troubles In Dreams (song)|Wrap Your Troubles In Dreams]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>In the early months of 1931, a solo recording contract came Bing's way, [[Mack Sennett]] signed him to make film shorts and a break with the Rhythm Boys became almost inevitable</span>
				<span class='text'>Bing had married Dixie Lee in September 1930 and after a threatened divorce in March 1931, he started to apply himself seriously to his career</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=kl</span>
				<span class='text'>/&gt;As the 1930s unfolded, Crosby became the leading singer in America</span>
				<span class='text'>Ten of the top 50 songs for 1931 featured Crosby, either solo or with others</span>
				<span class='text'>A so-called &quot;Battle of the Baritones&quot; with singing star [[Russ Columbo]] proved short-lived, replaced with the slogan &quot;Bing Was King&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Crosby played the lead in a series of sound-era musical comedy short films for [[Mack Sennett]], signed with Paramount and starred in his first full-length feature, 1932's ''[[The Big Broadcast]]'', the first of 55 films in which he received top billing</span>
				<span class='text'>He would appear in 79 pictures, and signed a long-term deal with [[Jack Kapp]]'s new record company [[Decca Records|Decca]] in late 1934</span>
				<span class='text'>is first commercial sponsor on radio was Cremo Cigars and increasingly his fame spread nationwide</span>
				<span class='text'>After a long run in New York, Bing went back to Hollywood to film [[The Big Broadcast]] and his personal appearances, his records, and his radio work substantially increased his impact</span>
				<span class='text'>The success of his first full-length film brought him a contract with Paramount and he began a regular pattern of making three films a year</span>
				<span class='text'>On radio, he fronted his own show for Woodbury Soap for two seasons and gradually his live appearances dwindled</span>
				<span class='text'>His records produced hit after hit at a time when record sales generally were in decline because of the Depression</span>
				<span class='text'>Critically acclaimed audio engineer [[Steve Hoffman (audio engineer)|Steve Hoffman]] once stated: &quot;By the way, Bing actually saved the record business in 1934 when he agreed to support Decca founder Jack Kapp's crazy idea of lowering the price of singles from a dollar to 35 cents and getting a royalty for records sold instead of a flat fee</span>
				<span class='text'>Bing's name and his artistry saved the recording industry</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[Pennies from Heaven (1936 film)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Crosby talked to [[Harry Cohn]] about the matter, but he disagreed saying: &quot;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;no reason to entail the expense of flying him in and having no desire to negotiate with Armstrong's crude, mob-linked but devoted manager, [[Joe Glaser]]</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Bing threatened to walk out on the film and refused to discuss it with Cohn</span>
				<span class='text'>Armstrong's musical scenes, along with some comical dialogue as well, heightened his career</span>
				<span class='text'>Bing also had it that Armstrong made high billing alongside his white co-stars, one of the first times ever for a black performer in a wide-audience film</span>
				<span class='text'>He starred as himself in many more films to come and had a large appreciation for Bing's unracist views, often thanking him in his later years</span>

				<span class='text'>As [[Henry Pleasants (music critic)|Henry Pleasants]] noted in ''The Great American Popular Singers'', something new had entered American music, a style that might be called &quot;singing in American&quot; with conversational ease</span>

				<span class='text'>Today he is a kind of national institution</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; They also state: &quot;In all, 60,000,000 Crosby disks have been marketed since he made his first record in 1931</span>
				<span class='text'>His biggest best seller is White Christmas, 2,000,000 impressions of which have been sold in the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>and 250,000 in Great Britain</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; They go on to say: &quot;Nine out of ten singers and bandleaders listen to Crosby's broadcasts each Thursday night and follow his lead</span>
				<span class='text'>The day after he sings a song over the air - any song - some 50,000 copies of it are sold throughout the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Time and again Crosby has taken some new or unknown ballad, has given it what is known in trade circles as the &quot;big goose&quot; and made it a hit single-handed and overnight</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; and &quot;Precisely what the future holds for Crosby neither his family nor his friends can conjecture</span>
				<span class='text'>He has achieved greater popularity, made more money, attracted vaster audiences than any other entertainer in history</span>

				<span class='text'>The nation's appetite for Crosby's voice and personality appears insatiable</span>
				<span class='text'>To soldiers overseas and to foreigners he has become a kind of symbol of America, of the amiable, humorous citizen of a free land</span>
				<span class='text'>Crosby, however, seldom bothers to contemplate his future</span>
				<span class='text'>For one thing, he enjoys hearing himself sing, and if ever a day should dawn when the public wearies of him, he will complacently go right on singing - to himself</span>

				<span class='text'>It topped the charts again in 1945, and for a third time in January 1947</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Crosby's love and appreciation of jazz music helped bring the genre to a wider mainstream audience</span>
				<span class='text'>Within the framework of the novelty-singing style of [[the Rhythm Boys]], Crosby bent notes and added off-tune phrasing, an approach that was firmly rooted in jazz</span>
				<span class='text'>He had already been introduced to [[Louis Armstrong]] and [[Bessie Smith]] prior to his first appearance on record</span>
				<span class='text'>Crosby and Armstrong would remain professionally friendly for decades, notably in the 1956 film ''[[High Society (1956 film)|High Society]]'', where they sang the duet &quot;Now You Has Jazz&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>But [[Jack Kapp]] (manager of [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]] and later [[Decca Records|Decca]]) talked Crosby into dropping many of his jazzier mannerisms, in favor of a straight-ahead clear vocal style</span>
				<span class='text'>Crosby credited Kapp for choosing hit songs, working with many other artists, and most importantly, diversifying his repertoire into various styles and genres</span>
				<span class='text'>This approach's wide appeal helped Crosby become highly successful, charting number-one hits in the genres of [[Christmas music]], [[Hawaiian music]] and [[Country music]], as well as top-thirty hits in [[Irish music]], [[French popular music|French music]], [[Rhythm and blues]], as well as [[Ballad]] songs</span>

				<span class='text'>Crosby's radio career took a significant turn in 1945, when he clashed with NBC over his insistence that he be allowed to pre-record his radio shows</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;http://ethw</span>
				<span class='text'>rg/Bing_Crosby_and_Magnetic_Recording&lt;/ref&gt; (The live production of radio shows was also reinforced by the musicians' union and [[ASCAP]], which wanted to ensure continued work for their members</span>
				<span class='text'> In ''On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio'', historian John Dunning wrote about German engineers having developed a tape recorder with a near-professional [[broadcast quality]] standard:&lt;blockquote&gt;[Crosby saw] an enormous advantage in prerecording his radio shows</span>
				<span class='text'>The scheduling could now be done at the star's convenience</span>
				<span class='text'>He could do four shows a week, if he chose, and then take a month off</span>
				<span class='text'>But the networks and sponsors were adamantly opposed</span>
				<span class='text'>The public wouldn't stand for 'canned' radio, the networks argued</span>
				<span class='text'>There was something magic for listeners in the fact that what they were hearing was being performed and heard everywhere, at that precise instant</span>
				<span class='text'>Some of the best moments in comedy came when a line was blown and the star had to rely on wit to rescue a bad situation</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Fred Allen]], [[Jack Benny]], [[Phil Harris]], and also Crosby were masters at this, and the networks weren't about to give it up easily</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/blockquote&gt;Crosby's insistence eventually factored into the further development of [[magnetic tape sound recording]] and the radio industry's widespread adoption of it</span>

				<span class='text'>But NBC (and competitor CBS) were also insistent, refusing to air prerecorded radio programs</span>
				<span class='text'>Crosby walked away from the network and stayed off the air for seven months, creating a legal battle with [[Kraft Foods|Kraft]], his sponsor, that was settled out of court</span>
				<span class='text'>Crosby returned to the air for the last 13 weeks of the 1945–1946 season</span>
				<span class='text'>he [[Mutual Broadcasting System|Mutual]] network, on the other hand, had pre-recorded some of its programs as early as the 1938 run of ''[[The Shadow]]'' with [[Orson Welles]]</span>
				<span class='text'>And the new [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network, which had been formed out of the sale of the old [[NBC Blue Network]] in 1943 following a federal [[anti-trust]] action, was willing to join Mutual in breaking the tradition</span>
				<span class='text'>ABC offered Crosby $30,000 per week to produce a recorded show every Wednesday that would be sponsored by [[Philco]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He would also get an additional $40,000 from 400 independent stations for the rights to broadcast the 30-minute show, which was sent to them every Monday on three 16-inch lacquer/[[aluminum disc]]s that played ten minutes per side at 33⅓ rpm</span>
				<span class='text'>rosby wanted to change to recorded production for several reasons</span>
				<span class='text'>The legend that has been most often told is that it would give him more time for his golf game</span>
				<span class='text'>And he did record his first Philco program in August 1947 so he could enter the [[Jasper National Park]] Invitational Golf Tournament in September, just when the new radio season was to start</span>
				<span class='text'>But golf was not the most important reason</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Bing Crosby Perry Como Arthur Godfrey 1950</span>
				<span class='text'>PG|left|thumb|With [[Perry Como]] and [[Arthur Godfrey]] in 1950]]Though Crosby did want more time to tend to his other business and leisure activities, he also sought better quality through recording, including being able to eliminate mistakes and control the timing of his show performances</span>
				<span class='text'>Because his own Bing Crosby Enterprises produced the show, he could purchase the latest and best sound equipment and arrange the [[microphones]] his way; the logistics of microphone placement had long been a hotly debated issue in every recording studio since the beginning of the electrical era</span>
				<span class='text'>No longer would he have to wear the hated toupee on his head previously required by [[CBS]] and [[NBC]] for his live audience shows (he preferred a hat)</span>
				<span class='text'>He could also record short promotions for his latest investment, the world's first frozen orange juice, sold under the brand name [[Minute Maid]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This investment allowed Crosby to make more money by finding a loophole whereby the IRS couldn't tax him at a 77% rate</span>

				<span class='text'>tml|work=Time | accessdate=August 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;The transcription method posed problems, however</span>
				<span class='text'>The acetate surface coating of the aluminum discs was little better than the wax that Edison had used at the turn of the 20th century, with the same limited dynamic range and frequency response</span>
				<span class='text'>owever, Murdo MacKenzie of Bing Crosby Enterprises had seen a demonstration of the German [[Magnetophon]] in June 1947—the same device that [[Jack Mullin]] had brought back from Radio Frankfurt, along with 50 reels of tape, at the end of the war</span>
				<span class='text'>It was one of the magnetic tape recorders that BASF and AEG had built in Germany starting in 1935</span>
				<span class='text'>The 6</span>
				<span class='text'>mm ferric-oxide-coated tape could record 20 minutes per reel of high-quality sound</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Alexander M</span>
				<span class='text'>Poniatoff]] ordered his [[Ampex|Ampex company]], which he'd founded in 1944, to manufacture an improved version of the Magnetophone</span>
				<span class='text'>rosby hired Mullin to start recording his ''Philco Radio Time'' show on his German-made machine in August 1947, using the same 50 reels of I</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Farben magnetic tape that Mullin had found at a radio station at [[Bad Nauheim]] near [[Frankfurt]] while working for the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Army Signal Corps</span>
				<span class='text'>The crucial advantage was editing</span>
				<span class='text'>As Crosby wrote in his autobiography:&lt;blockquote&gt;By using tape, I could do a thirty-five or forty-minute show, then edit it down to the twenty-six or twenty-seven minutes the program ran</span>
				<span class='text'>In that way, we could take out jokes, gags, or situations that didn't play well and finish with only the prime meat of the show; the solid stuff that played big</span>
				<span class='text'>We could also take out the songs that didn't sound good</span>
				<span class='text'>It gave us a chance to first try a recording of the songs in the afternoon without an audience, then another one in front of a studio audience</span>
				<span class='text'>We'd dub the one that came off best into the final transcription</span>
				<span class='text'>It gave us a chance to ad lib as much as we wanted, knowing that excess ad libbing could be sliced from the final product</span>
				<span class='text'>If I made a mistake in singing a song or in the script, I could have some fun with it, then retain any of the fun that sounded amusing</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/blockquote&gt;Mullin's 1976 memoir of these early days of experimental recording agrees with Crosby's account:&lt;blockquote&gt;In the evening, Crosby did the whole show before an audience</span>
				<span class='text'>If he muffed a song then, the audience loved it—thought it was very funny—but we would have to take out the show version and put in one of the rehearsal takes</span>
				<span class='text'>Sometimes, if Crosby was having fun with a song and not really working at it, we had to make it up out of two or three parts</span>
				<span class='text'>This [[Ad libitum|ad lib]] way of working is commonplace in the recording studios today, but it was all new to us</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/blockquote&gt;Crosby invested US$50,000 in [[Ampex]] with an eye towards producing more machines</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Sterling, C</span>
				<span class='text'>H</span>
				<span class='text'>1990&quot;/&gt; In 1948, the second season of Philco shows was taped with the new Ampex Model 200 tape recorder using the new Scotch 111 tape from the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing ([[3M]]) company</span>
				<span class='text'>Mullin explained how one new broadcasting technique was invented on the Crosby show with these machines:&lt;blockquote&gt;One time Bob Burns, the hillbilly comic, was on the show, and he threw in a few of his folksy farm stories, which of course were not in Bill Morrow's script</span>
				<span class='text'>Today they wouldn't seem very off-color, but things were different on radio then</span>
				<span class='text'>They got enormous laughs, which just went on and on</span>
				<span class='text'>We couldn't use the jokes, but Bill asked us to save the laughs</span>
				<span class='text'>A couple of weeks later he had a show that wasn't very funny, and he insisted that we put in the salvaged laughs</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus the laugh-track was born</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/blockquote&gt;Crosby had launched the tape recorder revolution in America</span>
				<span class='text'>In his 1950 film ''[[Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Music]]'', Crosby is seen singing into one of the new Ampex tape recorders that reproduced his voice better than anything else</span>
				<span class='text'>Also quick to adopt tape recording was his friend [[Bob Hope]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He gave one of the first Ampex Model 200 recorders to his friend, musician [[Les Paul]], which led directly to Paul's invention of [[multitrack recording]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His organization, the Crosby Research Foundation, also held various tape recording patents and developed equipment and recording techniques such as the [[laugh track]] that are still in use today</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>When one of us left a sneaker or pair of underpants lying around, he had to tie the offending object on a string and wear it around his neck until he went off to bed that night</span>
				<span class='text'>Dad called it &quot;the Crosby [[lavalier]]&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>By the time I was ten or eleven he had stepped up his campaign by adding lickings to the regimen</span>
				<span class='text'>Each Tuesday afternoon he weighed me in, and if the scale read more than it should have, he ordered me into his office and had me drop my trousers&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>I dropped my pants, pulled down my undershorts and bent over</span>
				<span class='text'>Then he went at it with the belt dotted with metal studs he kept reserved for the occasion</span>
				<span class='text'>Quite dispassionately, without the least display of emotion or loss of self-control, he whacked away until he drew the first drop of blood, and then he stopped</span>
				<span class='text'>It normally took between twelve and fifteen strokes</span>
				<span class='text'>As they came down I counted them off one by one and hoped I would bleed early&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>When I saw ''Going My Way'' I was as moved as they were by the character he played</span>
				<span class='text'>Father O'Malley handled that gang of young hooligans in his parish with such kindness and wisdom that I thought he was wonderful too</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead of coming down hard on the kids and withdrawing his affection, he forgave them their misdeeds, took them to the ball game and picture show, taught them how to sing</span>
				<span class='text'>By the last reel, the sheer persistence of his goodness had transformed even the worst of them into solid citizens</span>
				<span class='text'>Then the lights came on and the movie was over</span>

				<span class='text'>To guarantee success, he was asked to wildly exaggerate Bing's self-acknowledged paternal strictness</span>
				<span class='text'>Going My Own Way, published in 1983 and co-authored by Ross Firestone, was Gary's controversial attempt to transfer his professional and personal shortcomings onto his father; and to achieve the long desired leading role – playing Bing, no less – should his book be adapted to the screen</span>
				<span class='text'>This wasn't to be, as the book created considerable turmoil within the Crosby family</span>

				<span class='text'> The California Court of Appeal reversed, however, holding that the 1999 settlement barred the claim</span>
