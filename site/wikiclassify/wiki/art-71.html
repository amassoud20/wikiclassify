				<span class='text'>tm In October 1925 Crosby and his partner  brother of singer  decided to seek fame in California and they traveled to Los Angeles where they met up with Mildred Bailey</span>
				<span class='text'>She introduced them to her show business contacts and the Fanchon and Marco Time Agency hired them for thirteen weeks to take part in a revue called The Syncopation Idea starting at the Boulevard Theater in Los Angeles and then on the Loews circuit</span>
				<span class='text'>They each earned 75 a week</span>
				<span class='text'> Bing and Al Rinker began as a minor part of The Syncopation Idea and it was there that they started to develop as entertainers</span>
				<span class='text'>They had a lively and individual style and they were particularly popular with college students</span>
				<span class='text'>After The Syncopation Idea closed Bing and Al obtained work in the Will Morrissey Music Hall Revue which must have been fascinating if insecure</span>
				<span class='text'>However their skills were further honed during their time with Morrissey and when they subsequently had the chance to present their own independent act they blossomed and were quickly spotted by the  organization</span>
				<span class='text'>At that time it was felt that Whiteman needed something different and entertaining to break up the musical selections he was presenting and Crosby and Rinker filled this requirement admirably</span>
				<span class='text'>After less than a year in full time show business they had become part of one of the biggest names in the entertainment world</span>

				<span class='text'>Throughout his career Crosby often credited Mildred Bailey for getting him his first important job in the entertainment business</span>

				<span class='text'>tml  Initial successes with Whiteman were followed by disaster when they reached New York and for a while Whiteman must have thought of letting them go</span>
				<span class='text'>Possibly Bing might have been retained as Whiteman was already using him as a solo performer on record but the prospects for Rinker must have been bleak</span>
				<span class='text'>However the addition of pianist and aspiring songwriter  made all the difference to the act and  were born</span>
				<span class='text'>The additional voice meant that the boys could be heard more easily in the large New York theaters and they quickly became a real success</span>

				<span class='text'>Much has been written about the escapades of the three men during this period and clearly they were living life to the full</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite all of this Bing was continuing to develop and when the Rhythm Boys rejoined the Whiteman troupe in 1929 he had matured considerably as a performer</span>

				<span class='text'>Bing had married Dixie Lee in September 1930 and after a threatened divorce in March 1931 he started to apply himself seriously to his career</span>
				<span class='text'>His gramophone records in 1931 broke new ground as his powerful and emotional singing started to change the face of popular music forever</span>
				<span class='text'>heir low salaries at the Cocoanut Grove of the Ambassador Hotel had led the Rhythm Boys to walk out causing union problems for Bing</span>
				<span class='text'>Bings brother Everett interested  of CBS in his brother and Paley beckoned Bing to come to New York</span>
				<span class='text'>A settlement was reached with the Ambassador Hotel and Bing made his first solo national radio broadcast in September 1931 and then went on to star at the New York Paramount Theatre</span>

				<span class='text'>But NBC and competitor CBS were also insistent using to air prerecorded radio programs</span>
				<span class='text'>Crosby walked away from the network and stayed off the air for seven months creating a legal battle with  his sponsor that was settled out of court</span>
				<span class='text'>Crosby returned to the air for the last 13 weeks of the 1945–1946 season</span>

				<span class='text'>rosby wanted to change to recorded production for several reasons</span>
				<span class='text'>The legend that has been most often told is that it would give him more time for his golf game</span>
				<span class='text'>And he did record his first Philco program in August 1947 so he could enter the  Invitational Golf Tournament in September just when the new radio season was to start</span>
				<span class='text'>But golf was not the most important reason</span>
				<span class='text'>hough Crosby did want more time to tend to his other business and leisure activities he also sought better quality through recording including being able to eliminate mistakes and control the timing of his show performances</span>
				<span class='text'>Because his own Bing Crosby Enterprises produced the show he could purchase the latest and best sound equipment and arrange the  his way the logistics of microphone placement had long been a hotly debated issue in every recording studio since the beginning of the electrical era</span>
				<span class='text'>No longer would he have to wear the hated toupee on his head previously required by  and  for his live audience shows he perred a hat</span>
				<span class='text'>He could also record short promotions for his latest investment the worlds first frozen orange juice sold under the brand name </span>
				<span class='text'>This investment allowed Crosby to make more money by finding a loophole whereby the IRS couldnt tax him at a 77% rate</span>
				<span class='text'>name Time The transcription method posed problems however</span>
				<span class='text'>The acetate surface coating of the aluminum discs was little better than the wax that Edison had used at the turn of the 20th century with the same limited dynamic range and frequency response</span>
				<span class='text'>owever Murdo MacKenzie of Bing Crosby Enterprises had seen a demonstration of the German  in June 1947—the same device that  had brought back from Radio Frankfurt along with 50 reels of tape at the end of the war</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Army Signal Corps</span>
				<span class='text'>The crucial advantage was editing</span>
				<span class='text'>As Crosby wrote in his autobiographyblockquoteBy using tape I could do a thirty five or forty minute show then edit it down to the twenty six or twenty seven minutes the program ran</span>
				<span class='text'>In that way we could take out jokes gags or situations that didnt play well and finish with only the prime meat of the show the solid stuff that played big</span>
				<span class='text'>We could also take out the songs that didnt sound good</span>
				<span class='text'>It gave us a chance to first try a recording of the songs in the afternoon without an audience then another one in front of a studio audience</span>
				<span class='text'>Wed dub the one that came off best into the final transcription</span>
				<span class='text'>It gave us a chance to ad lib as much as we wanted knowing that excess ad libbing could be sliced from the final product</span>
				<span class='text'>If I made a mistake in singing a song or in the script I could have some fun with it then retain any of the fun that sounded amusing</span>
				<span class='text'>blockquoteMullins 1976 memoir of these early days of experimental recording agrees with Crosbys accountblockquoteIn the evening Crosby did the whole show before an audience</span>
				<span class='text'>If he muffed a song then the audience loved it—thought it was very funny—but we would have to take out the show version and put in one of the rehearsal takes</span>
				<span class='text'>Sometimes if Crosby was having fun with a song and not really working at it we had to make it up out of two or three parts</span>
				<span class='text'>This  way of working is commonplace in the recording studios today but it was all new to us</span>

				<span class='text'>Mullin explained how one new broadcasting technique was invented on the Crosby show with these machinesblockquoteOne time Bob Burns the hillbilly comic was on the show and he threw in a few of his folksy farm stories which of course were not in Bill Morrows script</span>
				<span class='text'>Today they wouldnt seem very off color but things were different on radio then</span>
				<span class='text'>They got enormous laughs which just went on and on</span>
				<span class='text'>We couldnt use the jokes but Bill asked us to save the laughs</span>
				<span class='text'>A couple of weeks later he had a show that wasnt very funny and he insisted that we put in the salvaged laughs</span>
