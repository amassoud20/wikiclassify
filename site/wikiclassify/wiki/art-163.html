				<span class='text'>They redefined the instrumentalist's role in rock and were one of the first blues-rock bands to emphasise musical virtuosity and lengthy jazz-style improvisation sessions</span>
				<span class='text'>Their US hit singles include &quot;[[Sunshine of Your Love]]&quot; (#5, 1968), &quot;[[White Room]]&quot; (#6, 1968) and &quot;[[Crossroads (song)|Crossroads]]&quot; (#28, 1969) – a live version of [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson's]] &quot;Cross Road Blues&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Clapton met Harrison and became friends with him after the Beatles shared a bill with the Clapton-era Yardbirds at the [[London Palladium]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The close friendship between Clapton and Harrison resulted in Clapton playing the lead guitar solo on Harrison's &quot;[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]&quot; from the Beatles' ''[[The Beatles (album)|White Album]]'' (1968)</span>

				<span class='text'>The shaken group undertook a US tour without Allman, who had returned to the Allman Brothers Band</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite Clapton's later admission that the tour took place amidst a veritable blizzard of drugs and alcohol, it resulted in the live double album ''[[In Concert (Derek and the Dominos album)|In Concert]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;A second record was in the works when a clashing of egos took place and Clapton walked, thus disbanding the group</span>
				<span class='text'>Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident on {{nowrap|29 October}} 1971</span>
