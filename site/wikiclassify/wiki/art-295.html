				<span class='text'>During one of these illnesses (about the winter of 373‚Äì374), he had a [[vision (spirituality)|vision]] that led him to lay aside his [[secular]] studies and devote himself to God</span>
				<span class='text'>He seems to have abstained for a considerable time from the study of the classics and to have plunged deeply into that of the [[Bible]], under the impulse of [[Apollinaris of Laodicea]], then teaching in [[Antioch]] and not yet suspected of [[Christian heresy|heresy]]</span>

				<span class='text'>During this period, he seems to have found time for studying and writing</span>
				<span class='text'>He made his first attempt to learn [[Hebrew]] under the guidance of a converted [[Jew]]; and he seems to have been in correspondence with [[Jewish Christians]] in Antioch</span>
				<span class='text'> Around this time he had copied for him a Hebrew Gospel, of which fragments are preserved in his notes, and is known today as the [[Gospel of the Hebrews]], and which the [[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarene]]s considered to be the true [[Gospel of Matthew]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Soon afterward, he went to [[Constantinople]] to pursue a study of Scripture under [[Gregory Nazianzen]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He seems to have spent two years there, then left, and the next three (382‚Äì385) he was in Rome again, as secretary to [[Pope Damasus I]] and the leading Roman Christians</span>

				<span class='text'>]In Rome he was surrounded by a circle of well-born and well-educated women, including some from the noblest [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] families, such as the widows [[Saint Lea|Lea]], [[Saint Marcella|Marcella]] and [[Saint Paula|Paula]], with their daughters [[Blaesilla]] and [[Eustochium]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The resulting inclination of these women towards the monastic life, away from the indulgent lasciviousness in Rome, and his unsparing criticism of the [[secular clergy]] of Rome, brought a growing hostility against him among the Roman clergy and their supporters</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon after the death of his patron [[Pope Damasus I|Damasus]] (10 December 384), Jerome was forced by them to leave his position at Rome after an inquiry was brought up by the Roman clergy into allegations that he had an improper relationship with the widow Paula</span>
				<span class='text'>Still, his writings were highly regarded by women who were attempting to maintain a vow of becoming a [[consecrated virgin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His letters were widely read and distributed throughout the Christian empire and it is clear through his writing that he knew these virgin women were not his only audience</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Megan Hale Williams 2006&quot;/&gt;Additionally, his condemnation of [[Blaesilla]]'s hedonistic lifestyle in Rome had led her to adopt ascetic practices, but it affected her health and worsened her physical weakness to the point that she died just four months after starting to follow his instructions; much of the Roman populace were outraged at Jerome for causing the premature death of such a lively young woman, and his insistence to Paula that [[Blaesilla]] should not be mourned, and complaints that her grief was excessive, were seen as heartless, polarising Roman opinion against him</span>

				<span class='text'>To these last 34 years of his career belong the most important of his works; his version of the Old Testament from the original Hebrew text, the best of his scriptural commentaries, his catalogue of Christian authors, and the dialogue against the [[Pelagianism|Pelagians]], the literary perfection of which even an opponent recognized</span>
				<span class='text'>To this period also belong most of his [[polemic]]s, which distinguished him among the orthodox Fathers, including the treatises against the [[Origenism]] later declared anathema, of [[Bishop John II of Jerusalem]] and his early friend Rufinus</span>
				<span class='text'>Later, as a result of his writings against [[Pelagianism]], a body of excited partisans broke into the monastic buildings, set them on fire, attacked the inmates and killed a [[deacon]], forcing Jerome to seek safety in a neighboring fortress (416)</span>

				<span class='text'>Modern scholarship, however, has cast doubts on the actual quality of Jerome's Hebrew knowledge</span>

				<span class='text'>]Jerome's commentaries fall into three groups:* His translations or recastings of Greek predecessors, including fourteen homilies on the [[Book of Jeremiah]] and the same number on the [[Book of Ezekiel]] by Origen (translated ca</span>
				<span class='text'>380 in Constantinople); two homilies of [[Origen of Alexandria]] on the [[Song of Solomon]] (in Rome, ca</span>
				<span class='text'>383); and thirty-nine on the [[Gospel of Luke]] (ca</span>
				<span class='text'>389, in Bethlehem)</span>
				<span class='text'>The nine homilies of Origen on the [[Book of Isaiah]] included among his works were not done by him</span>
				<span class='text'>Here should be mentioned, as an important contribution to the topography of Palestine, his book ''De situ et nominibus locorum Hebraeorum,'' a translation with additions and some regrettable omissions of the ''[[Onomasticon (Eusebius)|Onomasticon]]'' of [[Eusebius]]</span>
				<span class='text'>To the same period (ca</span>
				<span class='text'>390) belongs the ''Liber interpretationis nominum Hebraicorum'', based on a work supposed to go back to [[Philo]] and expanded by Origen</span>
				<span class='text'> Original commentaries on the Old Testament</span>
				<span class='text'>To the period before his settlement at Bethlehem and the following five years belong a series of short Old Testament studies: ''De seraphim'', ''De voce Osanna'', ''De tribus quaestionibus veteris legis'' (usually included among the letters as 18, 20, and 36); ''Quaestiones hebraicae in Genesim''; ''Commentarius in Ecclesiasten''; ''Tractatus septem in Psalmos 10‚Äì16'' (lost); ''Explanationes in Michaeam'', ''Sophoniam'', ''Nahum'', ''Habacuc'', ''Aggaeum</span>
				<span class='text'>' After 395 he composed a series of longer commentaries, though in rather a desultory fashion: first on Jonah and Obadiah (396), then on Isaiah (ca</span>
				<span class='text'>395-ca</span>
				<span class='text'>400), on Zechariah, Malachi, Hoseah, Joel, Amos (from 406), on the [[Book of Daniel]] (ca</span>
				<span class='text'>407), on Ezekiel (between 410 and 415), and on Jeremiah (after 415, left unfinished)</span>
				<span class='text'> New Testament commentaries</span>
				<span class='text'>These include only [[Epistle to Philemon|Philemon]], [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]], [[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]], and [[Epistle to Titus|Titus]] (hastily composed 387‚Äì388); [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] (dictated in a fortnight, 398); [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], selected passages in [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], [[Revelation]], and the prologue to the [[Gospel of John]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Historical and hagiographic writings=={{Unreferenced section|date=August 2011}}[[File:Hans Bilger Kirchenvater 3 Liebieghaus</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|In the Middle Ages, Jerome was often ahistorically depicted as a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]</span>
				<span class='text'>]Jerome is also known as a historian</span>
				<span class='text'>One of his earliest historical works was his ''Chronicle'' (or ''[[Chronicon (Jerome)|Chronicon]]'' or ''Temporum liber''), composed ca</span>
				<span class='text'>380 in Constantinople; this is a translation into Latin of the chronological tables which compose the second part of the ''[[Chronicon (Eusebius)|Chronicon]]'' of [[Eusebius]], with a supplement covering the period from 325 to 379</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite numerous errors taken over from Eusebius, and some of his own, Jerome produced a valuable work, if only for the impulse which it gave to such later chroniclers as [[Prosper of Aquitaine|Prosper]], [[Cassiodorus]], and [[Victor of Tunnuna]] to continue his annals</span>
				<span class='text'>f considerable importance as well is the ''[[De Viris Illustribus (Jerome)|De viris illustribus]]'', which was written at [[Bethlehem]] in 392, the title and arrangement of which are borrowed from [[Lives of the Twelve Caesars|Suetonius]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It contains short biographical and literary notes on 135 Christian authors, from [[Saint Peter]] down to Jerome himself</span>
				<span class='text'>For the first seventy-eight authors Eusebius (''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia ecclesiastica]]'') is the main source; in the second section, beginning with [[Arnobius]] and [[Lactantius]], he includes a good deal of independent information, especially as to western writers</span>
				<span class='text'>our works of a [[hagiography|hagiographic]] nature are:* the ''[[Vita Pauli monachi]],'' written during his first sojourn at [[Antioch]] (ca</span>
				<span class='text'>376), the legendary material of which is derived from Egyptian monastic tradition;* the ''Vitae Patrum (Vita Pauli primi eremitae),'' a biography of [[Saint Paul of Thebes]];* the ''[[Vita Malchi monachi captivi]]'' (ca</span>
				<span class='text'>391), probably based on an earlier work, although it purports to be derived from the oral communications of the aged [[ascetic]] [[Malchus]] originally made to him in the desert of Chalcis;* the ''[[Vita Hilarionis]],'' of the same date, containing more trustworthy historical matter than the other two, and based partly on the biography of [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]] and partly on [[oral tradition]]</span>
				<span class='text'>he so-called ''[[Martyrologium Hieronymianum]]'' is spurious; it was apparently composed by a western monk toward the end of the 6th or beginning of the 7th century, with reference to an expression of Jerome's in the opening chapter of the ''Vita Malchi,'' where he speaks of intending to write a history of the saints and martyrs from the [[apostolic times]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Letters==[[File:MatthiasStom-SaintJerome-Nantes</span>

				<span class='text'>Because there was no distinct line between personal documents and those meant for publication, we frequently find in his letters both confidential messages and treatises meant for others besides the one to whom he was writing</span>

				<span class='text'>Jerome'', by [[Jacopo Palma il Giovane]]]]Practically all of Jerome's productions in the field of [[dogma]] have a more or less vehemently [[polemic]]al character, and are directed against assailants of the orthodox doctrines</span>
				<span class='text'>Even the translation of the treatise of [[Didymus the Blind]] on the [[Holy Spirit]] into Latin (begun in Rome 384, completed at Bethlehem) shows an [[apologetic]] tendency against the [[Arianism|Arians]] and [[Pneumatomachoi]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The same is true of his version of Origen's ''De principiis'' (ca</span>
				<span class='text'>399), intended to supersede the inaccurate translation by Rufinus</span>
				<span class='text'>The more strictly polemical writings cover every period of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>During the sojourns at Antioch and Constantinople he was mainly occupied with the Arian controversy, and especially with the schisms centering around [[Meletius of Antioch]] and [[Lucifer Calaritanus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Two letters to Pope Damasus (15 and 16) complain of the conduct of both parties at Antioch, the Meletians and Paulinians, who had tried to draw him into their controversy over the application of the terms ''ousia'' and ''hypostasis'' to the [[Trinity]]</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time or a little later (379) he composed his ''Liber Contra Luciferianos'', in which he cleverly uses the dialogue form to combat the tenets of that faction, particularly their rejection of [[baptism]] by heretics</span>
				<span class='text'>n Rome (ca</span>
				<span class='text'>383) he wrote a passionate counterblast against the teaching of [[Helvidius]], in defense of the doctrine of the [[perpetual virginity of Mary]] and of the superiority of the single over the married state</span>
				<span class='text'>An opponent of a somewhat similar nature was [[Jovinianus]], with whom he came into conflict in 392 (''Adversus Jovinianum'', [[Against Jovinianus]]) and the defense of this work addressed to his friend [[Pammachius]], numbered 48 in the letters)</span>
				<span class='text'>Once more he defended the ordinary Catholic practices of [[piety]] and his own [[ascetic]] [[ethics]] in 406 against the Gallic [[presbyter]] [[Vigilantius]], who opposed the ''[[Cult (religious practice)|cult]]us'' of martyrs and relics, the vow of poverty, and clerical celibacy</span>
				<span class='text'>Meanwhile, the controversy with John II of Jerusalem and Rufinus concerning the orthodoxy of Origen occurred</span>
				<span class='text'>To this period belong some of his most passionate and most comprehensive polemical works: the ''Contra Joannem Hierosolymitanum'' (398 or 399); the two closely connected ''Apologiae contra Rufinum'' (402); and the &quot;last word&quot; written a few months later, the ''Liber tertius seuten ultima responsio adversus scripta Rufini</span>
				<span class='text'>' The last of his polemical works is the skilfully composed ''Dialogus contra Pelagianos'' (415)</span>

				<span class='text'>As a prominent member of the Roman clergy, he has often been portrayed anachronistically in the garb of a [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Even when he is depicted as a half-clad [[anchorite]], with cross, skull and Bible for the only furniture of his cell, the red hat or some other indication of his rank as cardinal is as a rule introduced somewhere in the picture</span>
				<span class='text'>During Jerome's life, cardinals did not exist</span>
				<span class='text'>However, by the time of the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Baroque]] it was common practice for a secretary to the pope to be a cardinal (as Jerome had effectively been to Damasus), and so this was reflected in artistic interpretations</span>
				<span class='text'>e is also often depicted with a [[lion]], in reference to the popular hagiographical belief that Jerome had tamed a lion in the wilderness by healing its paw</span>
				<span class='text'>The source for the story may actually have been the second century Roman tale of [[Androcles]], or confusion with the exploits of [[Gerasimus of the Jordan|Saint Gerasimus]] (Jerome in Latin is &quot;Geronimus&quot;)</span>

				<span class='text'>Rice conjectures (''Saint Jerome in the Renaissance'', pp</span>
