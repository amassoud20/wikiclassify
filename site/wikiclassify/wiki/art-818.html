				<span class='text'>Born in [[Brussels]] as the second (but eldest surviving) son of [[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold I]] and {{lang|fr|[[Louise of Orléans]]}}, he succeeded his father to the throne on 17 December 1865, reigning for 44 years until his death</span>
				<span class='text'>This was the longest reign of any Belgian monarch</span>
				<span class='text'>eopold was the founder and sole owner of the [[Congo Free State]], a private project undertaken on his own behalf</span>
				<span class='text'>He used explorer [[Henry Morton Stanley]] to help him lay claim to the Congo, an area now known as the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]</span>
				<span class='text'>At the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884–1885, the colonial nations of Europe authorized his claim by committing the Congo Free State to improving the lives of the native inhabitants</span>
				<span class='text'>From the beginning, however, Leopold essentially ignored these conditions</span>
				<span class='text'>He ran the Congo using the mercenary [[Force Publique]] for his personal enrichment</span>
				<span class='text'>He used great sums of the money from this exploitation for public and private construction projects in Belgium during this period</span>
				<span class='text'>He donated the private buildings to the state before his death, to preserve them for Belgium</span>
				<span class='text'>eopold extracted a fortune from the Congo, initially by the collection of [[ivory]], and after a rise in the price of [[rubber]] in the 1890s, by forced labour from the natives to harvest and process rubber</span>
				<span class='text'>Under his regime millions of [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] people died; modern estimates range from 1 to 15 million, with a consensus growing around 10 million</span>
				<span class='text'>Human rights abuses under his regime contributed significantly to these deaths</span>
				<span class='text'>Reports of deaths and abuse led to a major international scandal in the early 20th century, and Leopold was ultimately forced by the Belgian government to relinquish control of the colony to the civil administration in 1908</span>
				<span class='text'>=Early life and education==[[File:Leopold Duke of Brabant</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|upright|Leopold in 1844]]Leopold was born in [[Brussels]] on 9 April 1835</span>
				<span class='text'>He was the second child of the reigning Belgian monarch, [[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold I]], and his second wife, [[Louise of Orléans|Louise]], the daughter of [[Louis Philippe I|King Louis Philippe]] of [[France]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[French Revolution of 1848]], which spared Belgium, had forced Louis Philippe to flee to the [[United Kingdom]], ruled by Leopold's German cousin [[Queen Victoria]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The royal families of Belgium and the United Kingdom were linked by numerous marriages, and were additionally both descended from the [[House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis Philippe died two years later, in 1850</span>
				<span class='text'>Leopold's fragile mother was deeply affected by the death of her father, and her health deteriorated</span>
				<span class='text'>She died that same year, when Leopold was 15 years old</span>
				<span class='text'>=Marriage and family==Three years later, in 1853 at the age of 18, he married [[Marie Henriette of Austria]] in Brussels on August 22</span>
				<span class='text'>Marie Henriette was a cousin of [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria]], and granddaughter of [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor]] through her father, Austrian archduke [[Archduke Joseph, Palatine of Hungary|Joseph]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Marie Henriette was lively and energetic, and endeared herself to the people by her elevated character and indefatigable benevolence, while her beauty gained for her the sobriquet of &quot;The Rose of Brabant&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot; /&gt; She was also an accomplished artist and musician</span>
				<span class='text'>A fine horsewoman, she was passionate about [[horseback riding]] to the point that she would care for her horses personally</span>
				<span class='text'>Some joked about this &quot;marriage of a [[hostler|stableman]] and a [[nun]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} « mariage d'un palefrenier et d'une religieuse »&lt;/ref&gt; the shy and withdrawn Leopold referred to as the nun</span>
				<span class='text'>our children were born of this marriage, three daughters and one son, also named [[Prince Leopold, Duke of Brabant|Leopold]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The younger Leopold died in 1869 at the age of nine from [[pneumonia]] after falling into a pond</span>
				<span class='text'>His death was a source of great sorrow for King Leopold, who lost his only heir</span>
				<span class='text'>The marriage had become unhappy and the couple lived more or less separate lives</span>
				<span class='text'>They separated completely after a last attempt to have another son, a union which resulted in the birth of their last daughter Clementine</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1895 Marie Henriette retreated to [[Spa, Belgium|Spa]] to live out the remainder of her days</span>
				<span class='text'>She died there in 1902</span>

				<span class='text'>&lt;br /&gt;'''''The Abbot:''''' Oh! Sire, at your age?&lt;br /&gt;'''''The King:''''' You should try it for yourself!]]Leopold had many mistresses</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1899 at age 65, Leopold took as a mistress [[Caroline Lacroix]], a 16-year-old French prostitute, and they remained together for the next decade until his death</span>
				<span class='text'>Leopold lavished upon her large sums of money, estates, gifts, and a noble title, ''Baroness Vaughan''</span>
				<span class='text'>Because of these gifts and the illegitimacy of their relationship, Caroline was deeply unpopular among the Belgian people and internationally</span>
				<span class='text'>She and Leopold married secretly in a religious ceremony five days before his death; their failure to perform a [[civil ceremony]] rendered the marriage invalid under Belgian law</span>
				<span class='text'>After the king's death, it was soon discovered that he had left Caroline a massive amount of wealth, which the Belgian government and Leopold's three estranged daughters tried to seize as rightfully theirs</span>
				<span class='text'>Caroline bore two illegitimate sons who were likely Leopold's; the boys would have had a strong claim to the throne had the marriage been valid</span>
				<span class='text'>=Early political career==[[File:Leopold of Belgium, Duke of Brabant; Nicaise de Keyser</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|left|Leopold as a younger man]]As Leopold's older brother, also named [[Louis Philippe, Crown Prince of Belgium|Louis Philippe]], had died the year before Leopold's birth, Leopold was heir to the throne from his birth</span>
				<span class='text'>When he was 9 years old, Leopold received the title of [[Duke of Brabant]], and was appointed a sub-lieutenant in [[Belgian Armed Forces|the army]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He served in the army until his accession in 1865, by which time he had reached the rank of lieutenant-general</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=EB &gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Leopold II}}&lt;/ref&gt;Leopold's public career began on his attaining the age of majority in 1855, when he became a member of the [[Senate (Belgium)|Belgian Senate]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He took a lively interest in the Senate, especially in matters concerning the development of Belgium and its trade, and began to urge Belgium's acquisition of colonies</span>
				<span class='text'>Between the years 1854 and 1865, Leopold travelled extensively abroad, visiting [[India]] and [[China]], as well as [[Egypt]] and the countries on the [[Mediterranean]] coast of [[Africa]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Leopold's father died on December 10, 1865, and Leopold took the oath of office on December 17, at the age of 30</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|Leopold II at his accession to the throne]]In 1865 Leopold became king</span>
				<span class='text'>Leopold explained his goal for his reign in an 1888 letter addressed to his brother, [[Prince Philippe, Count of Flanders]]: &quot;the country must be strong, prosperous, therefore have colonies of her own, beautiful and calm</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} « la patrie doit être forte, prospère, par conséquent posséder des débouchés à elle, belle et calme</span>
				<span class='text'>» ''The King to the Count of Flanders'', January 26, 1888; The Count of Flanders's papers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Leopold's reign was marked by a number of major political developments</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Liberal Party (Belgium)|Liberals]] governed Belgium from 1857 to 1880 and during their final year in power, legislated the [[Walthère Frère-Orban|Frère-Orban]] Law of 1879</span>
				<span class='text'>This law created free, secular, compulsory primary schools supported by the state and withdrew all state support from [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] primary schools</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1880 the [[Catholic Party (Belgium)|Catholic Party]] obtained a parliamentary majority and four years later restored state support to Catholic schools</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1885 various socialist and social democratic groups drew together and formed the [[Belgian Labour Party|Labour Party]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Increasing social unrest and the rise of the Labour Party forced the adoption of universal male [[suffrage]] in 1893</span>
				<span class='text'>uring Leopold's reign other social changes were enacted into law</span>
				<span class='text'>Among these were the right of workers to form [[labour union]]s and the abolition of the ''livret d'ouvrier'', an [[employment record book]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Laws against child labour were passed; children younger than 12 were not allowed to work in factories, children younger than 16 were not allowed to work at night, and women younger than 21 years old were not allowed to work underground</span>
				<span class='text'>Workers gained the right to be compensated for workplace accidents, and were given Sundays off</span>
				<span class='text'>he first revision of the [[Belgian constitution]] came in 1893 under Leopold's reign</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Universal male suffrage]] was introduced, though the effect of this was tempered by [[plural voting]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The eligibility requirements for [[senate (Belgium)|the senate]] were reduced, and elections would be based on a system of [[proportional representation]], which continues to this day</span>
				<span class='text'>Leopold pushed strongly to pass a royal referendum, whereby the king would have the power to consult the electorate directly on an issue, and use his [[veto]] according to the results of the referendum</span>
				<span class='text'>The proposal was rejected, as it would have given the king the power to override the elected [[government]]; Leopold was so disappointed that he considered [[abdication]]</span>

				<span class='text'>He achieved the construction of defensive fortresses [[Fortified Position of Liège|at Liège]], [[Fortified Position of Namur|at Namur]] and [[National redoubt of Belgium|at Antwerp]]</span>
				<span class='text'>During the [[Franco-Prussian War]], he managed to preserve Belgium's neutrality in a period of unusual difficulty and danger</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot; /&gt; Leopold pushed for a reform in military service, but he was unable to obtain one until he was on his death bed</span>
				<span class='text'>Under the old system of ''[[Remplacement]]'', the Belgian army was a combination of volunteers and a lottery, and it was possible for men to pay for substitutes for service</span>
				<span class='text'>This was replaced by a system in which one son in every family would have to serve in the military</span>
				<span class='text'>==Builder King===[[Image:Brussels Cinquantenaire R02</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|The [[triumphal arch]] of the ''[[Cinquantenaire]]'' complex in [[Brussels]]]]Leopold commissioned a great number of buildings, urban projects and public works, largely with the profits generated from exploitation of natural resources from the Congo</span>
				<span class='text'>These projects earned him the epithet of &quot;Builder King&quot; (''Koning-Bouwer'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], ''le Roi-Bâtisseur'' in [[French language|French]])</span>
				<span class='text'>The public buildings were mainly in [[Brussels]], [[Ostend]] and [[Antwerp]], and include the [[Hippodrome Wellington]] racetrack, the [[Royal Galleries of Ostend|Royal Galleries]] and Maria Hendrikapark in [[Ostend]]; the [[Royal Museum for Central Africa]] and its surrounding park in [[Tervuren]]; the ''[[Cinquantenaire]]'' park, triumphal arch and complex, and the [[Duden Park]] in Brussels, and the 1895-1905 [[Antwerpen-Centraal railway station]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n addition to his public works, he acquired and built numerous private properties for himself inside and outside Belgium</span>
				<span class='text'>He expanded the grounds of the [[Royal Palace of Laeken]], and built the [[Royal Greenhouses of Laeken|Royal Greenhouses]], the Japanese Tower and the Chinese Pavilion near the palace</span>
				<span class='text'>In the [[Ardennes]], his domains consisted of {{convert|6700|ha|-3}} of forests and agricultural lands and the [[châteaux]] of [[Château royal d'Ardenne|Ardenne]], [[Ciergnon Castle|Ciergnon]], [[Château de Fenffe|Fenffe]], [[Château de Villers-sur-Lesse|Villers-sur-Lesse]] and [[Château de Ferage|Ferage]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also built important [[country estate]]s on the [[French Riviera]], including the ''[[Jardin botanique &quot;Les Cèdres&quot;|Villa des Cèdres]]'' and its [[botanical garden]], and the [[Villa Leopolda]]</span>
				<span class='text'>hinking to the future after his death, Leopold did not want the collection of estates, lands and heritage buildings he had privately amassed to be scattered amongst his daughters, each of whom was married to a foreign prince</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1900, he created the [[Royal Trust (Belgium)|Royal Trust]], by means of which he donated most of his property to the Belgian nation</span>
				<span class='text'>This preserved them to beautify Belgium in perpetuity, while still allowing future generations of the Belgian Royal family the privilege of their use</span>
				<span class='text'>==Attempted assassination===On 15 November 1902, [[Italy|Italian]] [[anarchist]] [[Gennaro Rubino]] had attempted to [[assassination|assassinate]] Leopold, who was riding in a royal cortege from a ceremony in memory of his recently deceased wife, Marie Henriette</span>
				<span class='text'>After Leopold's carriage passed, Rubino fired three shots at the King; the shots missed Leopold</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;'']]Leopold fervently believed that overseas colonies were the key to a country's greatness, and he worked tirelessly to acquire colonial territory for Belgium</span>
				<span class='text'>Leopold eventually began to acquire a colony as a private citizen</span>
				<span class='text'>The Belgian government lent him money for this venture</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1866, Leopold instructed the Belgian ambassador in Madrid to speak to Queen [[Isabella II of Spain]] about ceding the [[Philippines]] to Belgium</span>
				<span class='text'>However, knowing the situation fully, the ambassador did nothing</span>
				<span class='text'>Leopold quickly replaced the ambassador with a more sympathetic individual to carry out his plan</span>

				<span class='text'>But without funds, he was unsuccessful</span>
				<span class='text'>Leopold then devised another unsuccessful plan to establish the Philippines as an independent state, which could then be ruled by a Belgian</span>
				<span class='text'>When both of these plans failed, Leopold shifted his aspirations of colonization to Africa</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Looking Back pp 54-57&quot;/&gt;After numerous unsuccessful schemes to acquire colonies in Africa and Asia, in 1876 Leopold organized a private [[holding company]] disguised as an international scientific and philanthropic association, which he called the [[Association Internationale Africaine|International African Society]], or the International Association for the Exploration and Civilization of the Congo</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1878, under the auspices of the holding company, he hired the famous explorer [[Henry Morton Stanley|Henry Stanley]] to explore and establish a colony in the [[Kingdom of Kongo|Congo]] region</span>

				<span class='text'>On 5 February 1885, the [[Congo Free State]], an area 76 times larger than Belgium, was established under Leopold II's personal rule and [[private army]], the ''[[Force Publique]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>Abandoning the promises of the [[Berlin Conference]] in the late 1890s, the Free State government restricted foreign access and extorted [[forced labor]] from the natives</span>
