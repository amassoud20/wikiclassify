				<span class='text'>Holly was born in [[Lubbock, Texas]], to a musical family during the [[Great Depression]]; he learned to play guitar and to sing alongside his siblings</span>
				<span class='text'>His style was influenced by [[country music]] and [[rhythm and blues]] acts, and he performed in Lubbock with his friends from high school</span>
				<span class='text'>He made his first appearance on local television in 1952, and the following year he formed the group &quot;Buddy and Bob&quot; with his friend [[Bob Montgomery (musician)|Bob Montgomery]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1955, after opening for [[Elvis Presley]], Holly decided to pursue a career in music</span>
				<span class='text'>He opened for Presley three times that year; his band's style shifted from country and western to entirely rock and roll</span>
				<span class='text'>In October that year, when he opened for [[Bill Haley &amp; His Comets]], Holly was spotted by [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] scout Eddie Crandall, who helped him get a contract with [[Decca Records]]</span>
				<span class='text'>olly's recording sessions at Decca were produced by [[Owen Bradley]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Holly was unhappy with Bradley's restrictions and the results of their work, and went to producer [[Norman Petty]] in [[Clovis, New Mexico]], where, among other songs, they recorded a demo of &quot;[[That'll Be the Day]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Petty became the band's manager and he sent the demo to [[Brunswick Records]], which released it as a single credited to &quot;[[The Crickets]]&quot;, which became the name of Holly's band</span>
				<span class='text'>n September 1957, as the band toured, &quot;That'll Be the Day&quot; topped the [[List of Billboard number-one singles of 1957|US &quot;Best Sellers in Stores&quot;]] chart and the [[UK Singles Chart]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Its success was followed in October by another major hit, &quot;[[Peggy Sue]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>n November 1957, the album ''[[The &quot;Chirping&quot; Crickets|Chirping Crickets]]'' was released; it reached number five on the [[UK Albums Chart]]</span>
				<span class='text'>By January 1958, Holly had appeared twice on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Following his second performance on the show, he toured Australia and then the UK</span>
				<span class='text'>In early 1959, Holly assembled a new band consisting of future country music icon [[Waylon Jennings]] (bass) and [[Tommy Allsup]] (guitar), and embarked on a tour of the Midwestern U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>After a show in [[Clear Lake, Iowa]], Holly chartered an airplane to travel to his next show in [[Moorhead, Minnesota]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon after takeoff, the plane crashed, killing Holly, [[Ritchie Valens]], [[the Big Bopper]], and [[Roger Peterson (pilot)|the pilot]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It was a milestone in rock history known as [[The Day the Music Died]]</span>
				<span class='text'>uring his short career, Holly wrote, recorded, and produced his own material</span>
				<span class='text'>He is often regarded as the act that defined the traditional rock-and-roll lineup of two guitars, bass, and drums</span>
				<span class='text'>Holly was a major influence on later [[popular music]] artists and bands, including [[the Beatles]], [[the Rolling Stones]], [[Eric Clapton]], and [[Elton John]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was among the first acts to be inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1986, and later ranked by ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' at number 13 on its list of &quot;100 Greatest Artists&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>= Life and career=====Early life and career (1936–1955)===Charles Hardin Holley was born on September 7, 1936, in [[Lubbock, Texas]], at 3:30 pm; he was the fourth child of Lawrence Odell &quot;L</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot; Holley and Ella Pauline Drake</span>
				<span class='text'>His older siblings were Larry (born in 1925), Travis (born in 1927), and Patricia Lou (born in 1929)</span>
				<span class='text'>From early childhood, he was nicknamed &quot;Buddy&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Gribbin, John|2012|p=12}} During the [[Great Depression]], the Holleys frequently moved residence within Lubbock; L</span>
				<span class='text'> changed jobs several times</span>
				<span class='text'>The family were members of the [[Tabernacle Baptist Church]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Gribbin, John|2012|p=12}}The Holleys had an interest in music; all the family members except L</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>were able to play an instrument or sing</span>
				<span class='text'>The older Holley brothers performed in local talent shows; on one occasion, Buddy joined them on violin</span>
				<span class='text'>Since he could not play it, his brother Larry greased the strings so it would not make any sound</span>
				<span class='text'>The brothers won the contest</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Gribbin, John|2012|p=13}} During [[World War II]], Larry and Travis were called to military service</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon his return, Larry brought with him a guitar he had bought from a shipmate while serving in the Pacific</span>
				<span class='text'>At age 11, Buddy took piano lessons, but abandoned them after nine months</span>
				<span class='text'>He switched to guitar after he saw a classmate playing and singing on the school bus</span>
				<span class='text'>Buddy's parents initially bought him a [[steel guitar]], but he insisted that he wanted a guitar like his brother's</span>
				<span class='text'>His parents bought the guitar from a pawn shop and Travis taught him to play it</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Gribbin, John|2012|p=14}}During his early childhood, Buddy was influenced by the music of [[Hank Williams]], [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]], [[Hank Snow]], [[Bob Wills]], and the [[Carter Family]]</span>
				<span class='text'>At Roscoe Wilson Elementary, he met and became friends with [[Bob Montgomery (songwriter)|Bob Montgomery]];  Buddy and he played together, practicing with songs by the [[Louvin Brothers]] and Johnny and Jack</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Norman, Philip|2011|p=34}} They both listened to the radio programs ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' on [[WSM (AM)|WSM]] , ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'' on [[KWKH]], and ''[[Big D Jamboree]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time, Holley played with other musicians he met in high school, including [[Sonny Curtis]] and [[Jerry Allison]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Scott Schinder, Andy Schwartz|p=80|2007}} In 1952, Holley and Jack Neal participated as a duo billed &quot;Buddy and Jack&quot; in a talent contest on a local television show</span>
				<span class='text'>After Neal left, he was replaced by Montgomery and they were billed as &quot;Buddy and Bob&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The two soon started performing on the ''Sunday Party'' show on [[KDAV]] in 1953, and performed live gigs in Lubbock</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lehmer, Larry|p=6|2003}} At that time, Holley was influenced by late-night radio stations that played [[Blues]] and [[rhythm and blues]] (R&amp;B)</span>
				<span class='text'>Holley would sit in his car with Curtis and tune to distant radio stations that could only be received at night when local transmissions ceased</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lehmer, Larry|p=7|2003}} Holly then modified his music by blending his earlier country and western (C&amp;W) influence with R&amp;B</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Wishart, David|p=540|2004}}By 1955, after graduating from high school, Holley decided to pursue a full-time career in music</span>
				<span class='text'>He was further encouraged after seeing Elvis Presley performing live in Lubbock, whose act was booked by Pappy Dave Stone of KDAV</span>
				<span class='text'>In February, Holley opened for Presley at the Fair Park Coliseum, in April at the Cotton Club, and again in June at the Coliseum</span>
				<span class='text'>By that time, he had incorporated into his band Larry Welborne on the stand-up bass and Allison on drums, as his style shifted from C&amp;W to [[rock and roll]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lehmer, Larry|p=7|2003}} In October, Stone booked Bill Haley &amp; His Comets and placed Holley as the opening act to be seen by [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] scout Eddie Crandall</span>
				<span class='text'>Impressed, Crandall persuaded ''Grand Ole Opry'' manager Jim Denny to seek a recording contract for Holley</span>
				<span class='text'>Stone sent a demo tape, which Denny forwarded to [[Paul Cohen (record producer)|Paul Cohen]], who signed the band to [[Decca Records]] in February 1956</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Carr, Joseph; Munde, Alan|p=130|1997}} In the contract, Decca misspelled Holley's last name as &quot;Holly&quot;; from then on, he was known as &quot;Buddy Holly&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|MacDonald, Les|p=17|2010}}On January 26, 1956, Holly attended his first formal recording session, which was produced by [[Owen Bradley]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Scott Schinder, Andy Schwartz|2007|p=97}} He attended two more sessions in Nashville, but with the producer selecting the session musicians and arrangements, Holly became increasingly frustrated by his lack of creative control</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Carr, Joseph; Munde, Alan|1997|p=130}} In April 1956, Decca released &quot;[[Blue Days, Black Nights]]&quot; as a single, with &quot;Love Me&quot; on the B-side</span>
				<span class='text'>Denny included Holly on a tour as the opening act for [[Faron Young]]</span>
				<span class='text'>During the tour, they were promoted as &quot;Buddy Holly and the Two Tones&quot;, while later Decca called them &quot;Buddy Holly and the Three Tunes&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Carr, Joseph; Munde, Alan|1997|p=130}} The label later released Holly's second single &quot;Modern Don Juan&quot;, which was backed with &quot;You Are My One Desire&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Neither single made an impression</span>
				<span class='text'>On January 22, 1957, Decca informed Holly his contract would not be renewed, but insisted he could not record the same songs for anyone else for five years</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|Buddy Holly and the Crickets in 1957 (top to bottom: Allison, Holly and Mauldin)|thumb]]Holly was unhappy with the results of his time with Decca; he was inspired by the success of [[Buddy Knox]]'s &quot;[[Party Doll]]&quot; and [[Jimmy Bowen]]'s &quot;I'm Stickin' With You&quot;, and visited [[Norman Petty]], who had produced and promoted both records</span>
				<span class='text'>Together with Allison, bassist [[Joe B</span>
				<span class='text'>Mauldin]], and rhythm guitarist [[Niki Sullivan]], he went to Petty's studio in Clovis, New Mexico</span>
				<span class='text'>The group recorded a demo of &quot;[[That'll Be the Day]]&quot;, a song they had previously recorded in Nashville</span>
				<span class='text'>Now playing lead guitar, Holly achieved the sound he desired</span>
				<span class='text'>Petty became his manager and sent the record to [[Brunswick Records]] in New York City</span>
				<span class='text'>Holly was still under contract with Decca and could not use his name; it was decided a band name was to be used</span>
				<span class='text'>Allison proposed the name &quot;Crickets&quot;; Brunswick gave Holly a basic agreement to release &quot;That'll Be the Day&quot;, leaving him with both artistic control and financial responsibility for future recordings</span>

				<span class='text'>&quot;I'm Looking For Someone to Love&quot; was on the B-side; the single was credited to [[The Crickets]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Petty and Holly later learned that Brunswick was a subsidiary of Decca, which legally cleared future recordings under the name Buddy Holly</span>
				<span class='text'>Recordings credited to the Crickets would be released on Brunswick, while the recordings under Holly's name were released on another subsidiary label, [[Coral Records]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Holly concurrently held a recording contract with both labels</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Carr, Joseph; Munde, Alan|1997|p=131}}&quot;That'll Be the Day&quot; was released on May 27, 1957, with &quot;I'm Looking For Someone To Love&quot; on the B-side</span>
				<span class='text'>Petty booked Holly and the Crickets for a tour with [[Irvin Feld]], who had noticed the band after &quot;That'll Be the Day&quot; appeared on the R&amp;B chart</span>
				<span class='text'>He booked them for appearances in [[Washington DC]], [[Baltimore]], and New York City</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lehmer, Larry|2003|p=16}} The band was booked to play at New York's [[Apollo Theater]] on August 16–22</span>
				<span class='text'>During the opening performances, the group did not impress the audience, but they were accepted after they included &quot;[[Bo Diddley (Bo Diddley song)|Bo Diddley]]&quot; in their shows</span>
				<span class='text'>By the end of their run at the Apollo, &quot;That'll Be the Day&quot; was climbing the charts</span>
				<span class='text'>Encouraged by the single's success, Petty started to prepare two album releases; a solo album for Holly and another for The Crickets</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lehmer, Larry|2003|p=17}} Holly appeared on ''[[American Bandstand]]'' hosted by [[Dick Clark]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on August 26</span>
				<span class='text'>Before leaving New York, the band befriended the [[Everly Brothers]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lehmer, Larry|2003|p=18}}&quot;That'll Be the Day&quot; topped the [[Number-one hits of 1957 (United States)|US &quot;Best Sellers in Stores&quot;]] chart on September 23, and was number one on the UK Singles Chart for three weeks in November</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lehmer, Larry|2003|p=19}} On September 20, Coral released &quot;[[Peggy Sue]]&quot; backed with &quot;[[Everyday (Buddy Holly song)|Everyday]]&quot;, with Holly credited as the performer</span>
				<span class='text'>By October, &quot;Peggy Sue&quot; had reached number three on ''Billboard's'' pop chart and number two on the R&amp;B, while it peaked at number six on the UK Singles chart</span>
				<span class='text'>As the success of the song grew, it brought more attention to Holly, with the band at the time being billed as &quot;Buddy Holly and the Crickets&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Gribbin, John|2012|p=57}}In the last week of September, the band members flew to Lubbock to visit their families</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Gribbin, John|2012|p=58}} Holly's high school girlfriend, Echo McGuire, had left him for a fellow student</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Norman, Phillip|p=156|1996}} Aside from McGuire, Holly had a relationship with Lubbock fan June Clark</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Norman, Phillip|p=127|1996}} After Clark ended their relationship, Holly realized the importance of his relationship with McGuire and considered his with Clark a temporary one</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Norman, Phillip|p=156|1996}} Meanwhile, for their return to recording, Petty arranged a session in [[Oklahoma City]], where he was performing with his own band</span>
				<span class='text'>While the band drove to the location, the producer set up a makeshift studio</span>
				<span class='text'>The rest of the songs needed for an album and singles were recorded; Petty later dubbed the material in Clovis, New Mexico</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Gribbin, John|2012|p=58}} The resulting album, ''[[The &quot;Chirping&quot; Crickets]]'', was released on November 27, 1957</span>

				<span class='text'>Following the appearance, Niki Sullivan left the group because of the intensive touring</span>
				<span class='text'>On December 29, Holly and the Crickets performed &quot;Peggy Sue&quot; on ''[[The Arthur Murray Party]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Moore, Gary|2011|p=127}}===International tours (1958)===On January 8, 1958, Holly and the Crickets joined ''America's Greatest Teenage Recording Stars'' tour</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Norman, Philip|2011|p=189}} By February, the band toured England, playing 50 shows in 25 days</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Scott Schinder, Andy Schwartz|2007|p=88}} The same month, his debut solo album, ''[[Buddy Holly (album)|Buddy Holly]]'', was released</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon their return to the United States, Holly and the Crickets joined Alan Freed's ''Big Beat Show'' tour for 41 dates</span>
				<span class='text'>In April, Decca released ''[[That'll Be the Day (album)|That'll Be the Day]]'', featuring the songs recorded with Bradley during his early Nashville sessions</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Scott Schinder, Andy Schwartz|2007|p=90}}A new recording session in Clovis was arranged in May; Holly hired [[Tommy Allsup]] to play lead guitar</span>
				<span class='text'>The session produced the recordings of &quot;[[It's So Easy! (The Crickets song)|It's So Easy]]&quot; and &quot;[[Heartbeat (Buddy Holly song)|Heartbeat]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Holly was impressed by Allsup and invited him to join the Crickets</span>
				<span class='text'>In June, Holly traveled alone to New York for a solo recording session</span>
				<span class='text'>Without the Crickets, Holly chose to be backed by a jazz and R&amp;B band</span>
				<span class='text'>He chose to record &quot;Now We're One&quot; and [[Bobby Darin]]'s &quot;[[Early in the Morning (Bobby Darin song)|Early in the Morning]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Scott Schinder, Andy Schwartz|2007|p=91}}During his visit to the offices of [[Peermusic|Peer-South]], he met [[Maria Elena Santiago]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Holly asked Santiago out on their first meeting, and proposed marriage to her on their first date</span>
				<span class='text'>The wedding took place on August 15</span>
				<span class='text'>Petty disapproved of the marriage and advised Holly to keep it secret to avoid upsetting Holly's female fans</span>
				<span class='text'>Petty's reaction created friction between Holly and him; Holly also started to question Petty's bookkeeping</span>
				<span class='text'>The Crickets, frustrated because he controlled all of the proceeds from the band, also were in conflict with Petty</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Scott Schinder, Andy Schwartz|2007|p=92}}Holly and Santiago frequented many of New York's music venues, including [[the Village Gate]], Blue Note, [[Village Vanguard]], and Johnny Johnson's</span>
				<span class='text'>Santiago later said Holly was keen to learn fingerstyle flamenco guitar, and would often visit her aunt's home to play the piano there</span>
				<span class='text'>Holly planned collaborations between soul singers and rock and roll, and wanted to make an album with [[Ray Charles]] and [[Mahalia Jackson]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also had ambitions to work in film, and registered for acting classes with Lee Strasburg's [[Actors Studio]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Norman, Philip|2011|p=281}}Santiago accompanied Holly on tours</span>
				<span class='text'>To hide her marriage to Holly, she was presented as the Crickets' secretary</span>
				<span class='text'>She took care of the laundry and equipment set-up, and collected the concert revenues</span>
				<span class='text'>Santiago kept the money for the band instead of their habitual transfer to Petty in New Mexico</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Norman, Philip|2011|p=274}} She and her aunt Provi Garcia, executive of the Latin American music department at [[Peer-Southern]], convinced Holly that Petty was paying the band's royalties from Coral-Brunswick into his own company's account</span>
				<span class='text'>Holly planned to retrieve his royalties from Petty and to later fire him as manager and producer</span>
				<span class='text'>At the recommendation of the Everly Brothers, Holly hired lawyer Harold Orenstein to negotiate his royalties</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Norman, Philip|2011|p=280}} The problems with Petty were triggered after he was unable to pay Holly</span>
				<span class='text'>At the time, New York promoter Manny Greenfield reclaimed a large part of Holly's earnings; Greenfield had booked Holly for shows during previous tours</span>
				<span class='text'>The two had a verbal agreement; Greenfield would obtain 5% of the booking earnings</span>
				<span class='text'>Greenfield later felt he was also acting as Holly's manager and deserved a higher payment, which Holly refused</span>
				<span class='text'>Greenfield then sued Holly</span>
				<span class='text'>According to New York law, because the royalty proceedings of Holly were originated in New York and directed out-of-state, the payments were frozen until the dispute was settled</span>
				<span class='text'>Petty then could not complete the transfers to Holly, who considered him responsible for the missing profit</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Laing, Dave|p=153|2010}}In September, Holly returned to Clovis for a new recording session that yielded &quot;Reminiscing&quot; and &quot;Come Back Baby&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>During the session, he ventured into producing by recording Lubbock DJ [[Waylon Jennings]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Holly produced the single &quot;Jole Blon&quot; and &quot;When Sin Stops (Love Begins)&quot; for Jennings</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Carr, Joseph; Munde, Alan|1997|p=155}} Holly became increasingly interested in the New York music, recording, and publishing scene</span>
				<span class='text'>Santiago and he settled in Apartment 4H of the Brevoort Apartments located at 11 Fifth Avenue in [[Greenwich Village]], where he recorded a series of acoustic songs, including &quot;[[Crying, Waiting, Hoping]]&quot; and &quot;What to Do&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Norman, Philip|2011|p=274-278}} The inspiration to record the songs is sometimes attributed to the ending of his relationship to McGuire</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Webber, Julian Lloyd|2015}} In October,  Holly recorded tracks for Coral; these were backed by saxophonist [[Benny Goodman]] and an 18-piece orchestra composed of former members of the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]]</span>
