				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;M</span>
				<span class='text'>Pei''', is a [[Chinese American]] [[architect]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1948, Pei was recruited by New York real estate magnate [[William Zeckendorf]]</span>
				<span class='text'>There he spent seven years before establishing his own independent design firm I</span>
				<span class='text'>M</span>
				<span class='text'>Pei &amp; Associates in 1955, which became I</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Pei &amp; Partners in 1966 and later in 1989 became [[Pei Cobb Freed &amp; Partners]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Pei retired from full-time practice in 1990</span>
				<span class='text'>Since then, he has taken on work as an architectural consultant primarily from his sons' architectural firm [[Pei Partnership Architects]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His first major recognition came with the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] in Colorado; his new stature led to his selection as chief architect for the [[John F</span>
				<span class='text'>Kennedy Library]] in Massachusetts</span>
				<span class='text'>He went on to design [[Dallas City Hall]] and the East Building of the [[National Gallery of Art]]</span>
				<span class='text'>e returned to China for the first time in 1975 to design a hotel at [[Fragrant Hills]], and designed [[Bank of China Tower, Hong Kong]], a skyscraper in Hong Kong for the [[Bank of China]] fifteen years later</span>
				<span class='text'>In the early 1980s, Pei was the focus of controversy when he designed [[Louvre Pyramid|a glass-and-steel pyramid]] for the [[Musée du Louvre]] in Paris</span>
				<span class='text'>He later returned to the world of the arts by designing the [[Morton H</span>
				<span class='text'>Meyerson Symphony Center]] in Dallas, the [[Miho Museum]] in Japan, the [[Suzhou Museum]] in Suzhou, and the [[Museum of Islamic Art, Doha|Museum of Islamic Art]] in [[Qatar]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ei has won a wide variety of prizes and awards in the field of architecture, including the [[AIA Gold Medal]] in 1979, the first ''[[Praemium Imperiale]]'' for Architecture in 1989, and the Lifetime Achievement Award from the [[Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum]] in 2003</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1983, he won the [[Pritzker Prize]], sometimes called the [[Nobel Prize]] of architecture</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|alt=Men and women stand on curving rock formations overlooking a pond containing flowery plants</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;vb18&quot;&gt;Boehm, p</span>
				<span class='text'>18</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;]]Pei's ancestry traces back to the [[Ming Dynasty]], when his family moved from [[Anhui]] province to Suzhou</span>
				<span class='text'>Finding wealth in the sale of medicinal herbs, the family stressed the importance of helping the less fortunate</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>29–30; Boehm, p</span>
				<span class='text'>17</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Ieoh Ming Pei was born on April 26, 1917 to Tsuyee Pei and Lien Kwun, and the family moved to Hong Kong one year later</span>
				<span class='text'>The family eventually included five children</span>
				<span class='text'>As a boy, Pei was very close to his mother, a devout Buddhist who was recognized for her skills as a [[flautist]]</span>
				<span class='text'>She invited him, his brothers, and his sisters to join her on meditation retreats</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>31–32; Boehm, p</span>
				<span class='text'>25</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; His relationship with his father was less intimate</span>
				<span class='text'>Their interactions were respectful but distant</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>31&quot;&gt;Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>31</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Pei's ancestors' success meant that the family lived in the upper echelons of society, but Pei said his father was &quot;not cultivated in the ways of the arts&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>31</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The younger Pei, drawn more to music and other cultural forms than to his father's domain of banking, explored art on his own</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;I have cultivated myself&quot;, he said later</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>31&quot;/&gt;At the age of ten, Pei moved with his family to Shanghai after his father was promoted</span>
				<span class='text'>Pei attended Saint Johns Middle School, run by [[Protestantism|Protestant]] missionaries</span>
				<span class='text'>Academic discipline was rigorous; students were allowed only one half-day each month for leisure</span>
				<span class='text'>Pei enjoyed playing [[Cue sports|billiards]] and watching Hollywood movies, especially those of [[Buster Keaton]] and [[Charlie Chaplin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also learned rudimentary English skills by reading the [[Bible]] and novels by [[Charles Dickens]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;w3133&quot;&gt;Wiseman, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>31–33</span>

				<span class='text'>A blue sky overhead is obscured slightly by several clouds</span>
				<span class='text'>Pei describes the architecture of Shanghai's [[The Bund (Shanghai)|Bund]] waterfront area (seen here in a 2006 photo) as &quot;very much a colonial past&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Boehm, p</span>
				<span class='text'>22</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;]]Shanghai's many international elements gave it the name &quot;Paris of the East&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Boehm, p</span>
				<span class='text'>21</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The city's global architectural flavors had a profound influence on Pei, from the [[The Bund (Shanghai)|Bund]] waterfront area to the [[Park Hotel Shanghai|Park Hotel]], built in 1934</span>
				<span class='text'>He was also impressed by the many gardens of Suzhou, where he spent the summers with extended family and regularly visited a nearby ancestral shrine</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Lion Grove Garden|Shizilin Garden]], built in the 14th century by a Buddhist monk, was especially influential</span>
				<span class='text'>Its unusual rock formations, stone bridges, and waterfalls remained etched in Pei's memory for decades</span>
				<span class='text'>He spoke later of his fondness for the garden's blending of natural and human-built structures</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;vb18&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;w3133&quot;/&gt;Soon after the move to Shanghai, Pei's mother developed cancer</span>
				<span class='text'>As a pain reliever, she was prescribed [[opium]], and assigned the task of preparing her pipe to Pei</span>
				<span class='text'>She died shortly after his thirteenth birthday, and he was profoundly upset</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Boehm, p</span>
				<span class='text'>25</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The children were sent to live with extended family; their father became more consumed by his work and more physically distant</span>
				<span class='text'>Pei said: &quot;My father began living his own separate life pretty soon after that</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Boehm, p</span>
				<span class='text'>26</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  His father later married a woman named Aileen, who moved to New York later in her life</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|upright|thumb|right|alt=A man wearing a grey sweater and a fedora squats near an open box, holding a small canvas bag</span>
				<span class='text'>Pei said &quot;[[Bing Crosby]]'s films in particular had a tremendous influence on my choosing the United States instead of England to pursue my education</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Boehm, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>33–34</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;]]As Pei neared the end of his secondary education, he decided to study at an overseas university</span>
				<span class='text'>He was accepted to a number of schools, but decided to enroll at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>33–34</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Pei's choice had two roots</span>
				<span class='text'>While studying in Shanghai, he had closely examined the catalogs for various institutions of higher learning around the world</span>
				<span class='text'>The architectural program at the University of Pennsylvania stood out to him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>34</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The other major factor was Hollywood</span>
				<span class='text'>Pei was fascinated by the representations of college life in the films of [[Bing Crosby]], which differed tremendously from the academic atmosphere in China</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;College life in the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>seemed to me to be mostly fun and games&quot;, he said in 2000</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Since I was too young to be serious, I wanted to be part of it&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>You could get a feeling for it in Bing Crosby's movies</span>
				<span class='text'>College life in America seemed very exciting to me</span>
				<span class='text'>It's not real, we know that</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, at that time it was very attractive to me</span>
				<span class='text'>I decided that was the country for me</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Boehm, p</span>
				<span class='text'>34</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In 1935 Pei boarded the [[SS President Coolidge|SS ''President Coolidge'']] and sailed to San Francisco, then traveled by train to Philadelphia</span>
				<span class='text'>What he found, however, differed vastly from his expectations</span>
				<span class='text'>Professors at the University of Pennsylvania based their teaching in the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts style]], rooted in the classical traditions of Greece and Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>Pei was more intrigued by [[modern architecture]], and also felt intimidated by the high level of [[Architectural drawing|drafting]] proficiency shown by other students</span>
				<span class='text'>He decided to abandon architecture and transferred to the engineering program at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT)</span>
				<span class='text'>Once he arrived, however, the dean of the architecture school commented on his eye for design and convinced Pei to return to his original major</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>35</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;MIT's architecture faculty was also focused on the Beaux-Arts school, and Pei found himself uninspired by the work</span>
				<span class='text'>In the library he found three books by the Swiss-French architect Charles-Édouard Jeanneret-Gris, better known as [[Le Corbusier]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Pei was inspired by the innovative designs of the new [[International Style (architecture)|International style]], characterized by simplified form and the use of glass and steel materials</span>
				<span class='text'>Le Corbusier visited MIT in {{Nowrap|November 1935}}, an occasion which powerfully affected Pei: &quot;The two days with Le Corbusier, or 'Corbu' as we used to call him, were probably the most important days in my architectural education</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;vb36&quot;&gt;Boehm, p</span>
				<span class='text'>36</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Pei was also influenced by the work of US architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1938 he drove to [[Spring Green, Wisconsin]], to visit Wright's famous [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin]] building</span>
				<span class='text'>After waiting for two hours, however, he left without meeting Wright</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;wright&quot;&gt;Boehm, p</span>
				<span class='text'>36; Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>36</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Frank Lloyd Wright LC-USZ62-36384</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|upright|alt=A portrait photograph of a middle-aged man with bushy white hair, wearing a dark suit|Pei attempted to meet renowned architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], but gave up after waiting for two hours</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;wright&quot;/&gt;]]Although he disliked the Beaux-Arts emphasis at MIT, Pei excelled in his studies</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;I certainly don't regret the time at MIT&quot;, he said later</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;There I learned the science and technique of building, which is just as essential to architecture</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;vb40&quot;&gt;Boehm, p</span>
				<span class='text'>40</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Pei received his Bachelor of Architecture degree in 1940</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Boehm, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>40–41</span>
				<span class='text'>Pei used the term &quot;propaganda&quot;, which he believed to be value-neutral; his advisers disapproved</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He planned to return to China immediately afterward, but the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] forced him to change his plans</span>
				<span class='text'>Pei's father urged him to remain in the United States, and he worked for two years at the Boston engineering firm of [[Stone &amp; Webster]]</span>
				<span class='text'>hile visiting New York City in the late '30s, Pei met a [[Wellesley College]] student named Eileen Loo</span>
				<span class='text'>They began dating and they married in the spring of 1942</span>
				<span class='text'>She enrolled in the [[landscape architecture]] program at [[Harvard University]], and Pei was thus introduced to members of the faculty at Harvard's [[Harvard Graduate School of Design|Graduate School of Design]] (GSD)</span>
				<span class='text'>He was excited by the lively atmosphere, and joined the GSD in {{Nowrap|December 1942}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>39; Boehm, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>36–37</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Less than a month later, Pei suspended his work at Harvard to join the [[National Defense Research Committee]], which coordinated scientific research into US weapons technology during [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Pei's background in architecture was seen as a considerable asset; one member of the committee told him: &quot;If you know how to build you should also know how to destroy</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in von Boehm, p</span>
				<span class='text'>42; a slightly different wording appears in Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>39: &quot;If you know how to build a building, you know how to destroy it</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The fight against Germany was ending, so he focused on the [[Pacific War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The US realized that its bombs used against the stone buildings of Europe would be ineffective against Japanese cities, mostly constructed from wood and paper; Pei was assigned to work on [[incendiary device|incendiary bombs]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Pei spent two and a half years with the NDRC, but has revealed few details</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Boehm, p</span>
				<span class='text'>42</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In 1945 Eileen gave birth to a son, T'ing Chung; she withdrew from the landscape architecture program in order to care for him</span>
				<span class='text'>Pei returned to Harvard in the autumn of 1945, and received a position as assistant professor of design</span>
				<span class='text'>The GSD was developing into a hub of resistance to the Beaux-Arts orthodoxy</span>
				<span class='text'>At the center were members of the [[Bauhaus]], a European architectural movement that had advanced the cause of modernist design</span>
				<span class='text'>The Nazi regime had condemned the Bauhaus school, and its leaders left Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>Two of these, [[Walter Gropius]] and [[Marcel Breuer]], took positions at the Harvard GSD</span>
				<span class='text'>Their iconoclastic focus on modern architecture appealed to Pei, and he worked closely with both men</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>41–43; Boehm, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>37–40</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;One of Pei's design projects at the GSD was a plan for an art museum in Shanghai</span>
				<span class='text'>He wanted to create a mood of Chinese authenticity in the architecture without using traditional materials or styles</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;qw44&quot;&gt;Quoted in Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'> 44</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The design was based on straight modernist structures, organized around a central courtyard garden, with other similar natural settings arranged nearby</span>
				<span class='text'>It was very well received; Gropius, in fact, called it &quot;the best thing done in [my] master class&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;qw44&quot;/&gt; Pei received his master's degree in 1946, and taught at Harvard for another two years</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>45</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Career=====1948–56: Early career with Webb and Knapp===In the spring of 1948 Pei was recruited by New York real estate magnate [[William Zeckendorf]] to join a staff of architects for his firm of [[Webb and Knapp]] to design buildings around the country</span>
				<span class='text'>Pei found Zeckendorf's personality the opposite of his own; his new boss was known for his loud speech and gruff demeanor</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, they became good friends and Pei found the experience personally enriching</span>
				<span class='text'>Zeckendorf was well connected politically, and Pei enjoyed learning about the social world of New York's city planners</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>48–49</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;His first project for Webb and Knapp was an apartment building with funding from the [[Housing Act of 1949]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Pei's design was based on a circular tower with concentric rings</span>
				<span class='text'>The areas closest to the supporting pillar handled utilities and circulation; the apartments themselves were located toward the outer edge</span>
				<span class='text'>Zeckendorf loved the design and even showed it off to Le Corbusier when they met</span>
				<span class='text'>The cost of such an unusual design was too high, however, and the building never moved beyond the model stage</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>51</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;[[File:131 Ponce de Leon Ave</span>

				<span class='text'>The building was demolished in February 2013 although the front facade will be retained as part of an apartment development</span>
				<span class='text'>His use of marble for the exterior [[curtain wall (architecture)|curtain wall]] brought praise from the journal ''Architectural Forum''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>52</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Pei's designs echoed the work of [[Mies van der Rohe]] in the beginning of his career as also shown in his own weekend-house in Katonah in 1952</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon Pei was so inundated with projects that he asked Zeckendorf for assistants, which he chose from his associates at the GSD, including [[Henry N</span>
				<span class='text'>Cobb]] and [[Ulrich Franzen]]</span>
				<span class='text'>They set to work on a variety of proposals, including the [[Roosevelt Field (Shopping Mall)|Roosevelt Field Shopping Mall]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The team also redesigned the Webb and Knapp office building, transforming Zeckendorf's office into a circular space with [[teak]] walls and a glass [[clerestory]]</span>
				<span class='text'>They also installed a control panel into the desk that allowed their boss to control the lighting in his office</span>
				<span class='text'>The project took one year and exceeded its budget, but Zeckendorf was delighted with the results</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, pp</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>61</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;]]In 1952 Pei and his team began work on a series of projects in Denver, Colorado</span>
				<span class='text'>The first of these was the Mile High Center, which compressed the core building into less than twenty-five percent of the total site; the rest is adorned with an exhibition hall and fountain-dotted plazas</span>

				<span class='text'>57–58</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; One block away, Pei's team also redesigned Denver's Courthouse Square, which combined office spaces, commercial venues, and hotels</span>
				<span class='text'>These projects helped Pei conceptualize architecture as part of the larger urban geography</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;I learned the process of development,&quot; he said later, &quot;and about the city as a living organism</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;PeiLenfant&quot; /&gt; The team set out with a broad vision that was praised by both the ''[[Washington Post]]'' and ''[[Washington Star]]'' (which rarely agreed on anything), but funding problems forced revisions and a significant reduction in scale</span>

				<span class='text'>60–62</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}In 1955 Pei's group took a step toward institutional independence from Webb and Knapp by establishing a new firm called I</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;M</span>
				<span class='text'>Pei &amp; Associates</span>
				<span class='text'>(The name changed later to I</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;M</span>
				<span class='text'>Pei &amp; Partners</span>
				<span class='text'> They gained the freedom to work with other companies, but continued working primarily with Zeckendorf</span>
				<span class='text'>The new firm distinguished itself through the use of detailed [[architectural model]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>They took on the [[Kips Bay]] residential area on the east side of Manhattan, where Pei set up [[Kips Bay Towers]], two large long towers of apartments with recessed windows (to provide shade and privacy) in a neat grid, adorned with rows of trees</span>
				<span class='text'>Pei involved himself in the construction process at Kips Bay, even inspecting the bags of concrete to check for consistency of color</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>62–64</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The company continued its urban focus with the [[Society Hill, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Society Hill]] project in central [[Philadelphia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Pei designed the [[Society Hill Towers]], a three-building residential block injecting cubist design into the 18th-century milieu of the neighborhood</span>
				<span class='text'>As with previous projects, abundant green spaces were central to Pei's vision, which also added traditional [[townhouse]]s to aid the transition from classical to modern design</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Boehm, p</span>
				<span class='text'>51</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;From 1958 to 1963 Pei and [[Ray Affleck]] developed a key downtown block of Montreal in a phased process that involved one of Pei's most admired structures in the commonwealth, the cruciform tower known as the Royal Bank Plaza ([[Place Ville Marie]])</span>
				<span class='text'>According to the [[Canadian Encyclopedia]] &quot;its grand plaza and lower office buildings, designed by internationally famous US architect I</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Pei, helped to set new standards for architecture in Canada in the 1960s </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>The tower's smooth aluminum and glass surface and crisp unadorned geometric form demonstrate Pei's adherence to the mainstream of 20th-century modern design</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;The Canadian Encyclopedia online version&lt;/ref&gt;Although these projects were satisfying, Pei wanted to establish an independent name for himself</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1959 he was approached by MIT to design a building for its [[Earth science]] program</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Green Building (MIT)|Green Building]] continued the grid design of Kips Bay and Society Hill</span>
				<span class='text'>The pedestrian walkway at the ground floor, however, was prone to sudden gusts of wind, which embarrassed Pei</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Here I was from MIT,&quot; he said, &quot;and I didn't know about [[wind-tunnel]] effects</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>67</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, he designed the [[Luce Memorial Chapel]] in at [[Tunghai University]] in [[Taichung]], [[Taiwan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The soaring structure, commissioned by the same organisation that had run his middle school in Shanghai, broke severely from the cubist grid patterns of his urban projects</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>66–68</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The challenge of coordinating these projects took an artistic toll on Pei</span>
				<span class='text'>He found himself responsible for acquiring new building contracts and supervising the plans for them</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, he felt disconnected from the actual creative work</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Design is something you have to put your hand to,&quot; he said</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;While my people had the luxury of doing one job at a time, I had to keep track of the whole enterprise</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>69</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Pei's dissatisfaction reached its peak at a time when financial problems began plaguing Zeckendorf's firm</span>
				<span class='text'>I</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;M</span>
				<span class='text'>Pei and Associates officially broke from Webb and Knapp in 1960, which benefited Pei creatively but pained him personally</span>
				<span class='text'>He had developed a close friendship with Zeckendorf, and both men were sad to part ways</span>

				<span class='text'>60</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;]]====NCAR and Related Projects====Pei was able to return to hands-on design when he was approached in 1961 by [[Walter Orr Roberts]] to design the new [[Mesa Laboratory]] for the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] outside [[Boulder, Colorado]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The project differed from Pei's earlier urban work; it would rest in an open area in the foothills of the [[Rocky Mountains]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He drove with his wife around the region, visiting assorted buildings and surveying the natural environs</span>
				<span class='text'>He was impressed by the [[United States Air Force Academy]] in Colorado Springs, but felt it was &quot;detached from nature&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Boehm, p</span>
				<span class='text'>59</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The conceptualization stages were important for Pei, presenting a need and an opportunity to break from the Bauhaus tradition</span>
				<span class='text'>He later recalled the long periods of time he spent in the area: &quot;I recalled the places I had seen with my mother when I was a little boy—the mountaintop Buddhist retreats</span>
				<span class='text'>There in the Colorado mountains, I tried to listen to the silence again—just as my mother had taught me</span>
				<span class='text'>The investigation of the place became a kind of religious experience for me</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;vb60&quot;/&gt;Pei also drew inspiration from the [[Mesa Verde National Park|Mesa Verde]] cliff dwellings of the [[Ancient Pueblo Peoples]]; he wanted the buildings to exist in harmony with their natural surroundings</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>75–76</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; To this end, he called for a rock-treatment process that could color the buildings to match the nearby mountains</span>
				<span class='text'>He also set the complex back on the mesa overlooking the city, and designed the approaching road to be long, winding, and indirect</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>80</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Roberts disliked Pei's initial designs, referring to them as &quot;just a bunch of towers&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>79</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Roberts intended his comments as typical of scientific experimentation, rather than artistic critique; still, Pei was frustrated</span>
				<span class='text'>His second attempt, however, fit Roberts' vision perfectly: a spaced-out series of clustered buildings, joined by lower structures and complemented by two underground levels</span>
				<span class='text'>The complex uses many elements of cubist design, and the walkways are arranged to increase the probability of casual encounters among colleagues</span>

				<span class='text'>94</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;]]Once the laboratory was built, several problems with its construction became apparent</span>
				<span class='text'>Leaks in the roof caused difficulties for researchers, and the shifting of clay soil beneath caused cracks in the buildings which were expensive to repair</span>
				<span class='text'>Still, both architect and project manager were pleased with the final result</span>

				<span class='text'>91 and 74</span>

				<span class='text'>Kennedy]] was [[John F</span>
				<span class='text'>Kennedy assassination|assassinated]] in {{Nowrap|November 1963}}, his family and friends discussed how to construct a library that would serve as a fitting memorial</span>
				<span class='text'>A committee was formed to advise Kennedy's widow [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline]], who would make the final decision</span>
				<span class='text'>The group deliberated for months and considered many famous architects</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>96–98</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Kennedy chose Pei to design the library, based on two considerations</span>
				<span class='text'>First, she appreciated the variety of ideas he had used for earlier projects</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;He didn't seem to have just one way to solve a problem,&quot; she said</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;He seemed to approach each commission thinking only of it and then develop a way to make something beautiful</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>98</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, however, Kennedy made her choice based on her personal connection with Pei</span>
				<span class='text'>Calling it &quot;really an emotional decision&quot;, she explained: &quot;He was so full of promise, like Jack; they were born in the same year</span>
				<span class='text'>I decided it would be fun to take a great leap with him</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>99</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The project was plagued with problems from the outset</span>
				<span class='text'>The first was scope</span>
				<span class='text'>President Kennedy had begun considering the structure of his library soon after taking office, and he wanted to include archives from his administration, a museum of personal items, and a political science institute</span>
				<span class='text'>After the assassination, the list expanded to include a fitting memorial tribute to the slain president</span>
				<span class='text'>The variety of necessary inclusions complicated the design process and caused significant delays</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>95 and 100</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;[[File:JFK library Stitch Crop</span>

				<span class='text'>56</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;]]Pei's first proposed design included a large glass pyramid that would fill the interior with sunlight, meant to represent the optimism and hope that Kennedy's administration had symbolized for so many in the US</span>
				<span class='text'>Mrs</span>
				<span class='text'>Kennedy liked the design, but resistance began in Cambridge, the first proposed site for the building, as soon as the project was announced</span>
				<span class='text'>Many community members worried that the library would become a tourist attraction, causing particular problems with traffic congestion</span>
				<span class='text'>Others worried that the design would clash with the architectural feel of nearby [[Harvard Square]]</span>
				<span class='text'>By the mid-70s, Pei tried proposing a new design, but the library's opponents resisted every effort</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>102–113</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; These events pained Pei, who had sent all three of his sons to Harvard, and although he rarely discussed his frustration, it was evident to his wife</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;I could tell how tired he was by the way he opened the door at the end of the day,&quot; she said</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;His footsteps were dragging</span>
				<span class='text'>It was very hard for I</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;M</span>
				<span class='text'>to see that so many people didn't want the building</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>113</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Finally the project moved to [[Columbia Point (Boston)|Columbia Point]], near the [[University of Massachusetts Boston]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The new site was less than ideal; it was located on an old landfill, and just over a large sewage pipe</span>
				<span class='text'>Pei's architectural team added more fill to cover the pipe and developed an elaborate ventilation system to conquer the odor</span>
				<span class='text'>A new design was unveiled, combining a large square glass-enclosed atrium with a triangular tower and a circular walkway</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>115–116</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The [[John F</span>
				<span class='text'>Kennedy Library|John F</span>
				<span class='text'>Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum]] was dedicated on October 20, 1979</span>
				<span class='text'>Critics generally liked the finished building, but the architect himself was unsatisfied</span>
				<span class='text'>The years of conflict and compromise had changed the nature of the design, and Pei felt that the final result lacked its original passion</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;I wanted to give something very special to the memory of President Kennedy,&quot; he said in 2000</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;It could and should have been a great project</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;vb56&quot;/&gt; Pei's work on the Kennedy project boosted his reputation as an architect of note</span>

				<span class='text'>It is the informal name for two related commissions  by Pei – namely the Central Business District General Neighborhood Renewal Plan (design completed 1964) and the Central Business District Project I-A Development Plan (design completed 1966)</span>
				<span class='text'>It was formally adopted in 1965, and implemented in various public and private phases throughout the 1960s and 1970s</span>
				<span class='text'>he plan called for the demolition of hundreds of old downtown structures in favor of renewed parking, office building, and retail developments, in addition to public projects such as the Myriad Convention Center and the Myriad Botanical Gardens</span>
				<span class='text'>It was the dominant template for downtown development in Oklahoma City from its inception through the 1970s</span>
				<span class='text'>The plan generated mixed results and opinion, largely succeeding in re-developing office building and parking infrastructure but failing to attract its anticipated retail and residential development</span>
				<span class='text'>Significant public resentment also developed as a result of the destruction of multiple historic structures</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, Oklahoma City's leadership avoided large-scale urban planning for downtown throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, until the passage of the [[Metropolitan Area Projects Plan|Metropolitan Area Projects]] (MAPS) initiative in 1993</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|250px|right|alt=A tall beige building with an angled front face, leaning out from the top, is supported by three columns and covered with rows of windows|Pei wanted his design for [[Dallas City Hall]] to &quot;convey an image of the people&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>125</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;]]Kennedy's assassination led indirectly to another commission for Pei's firm</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1964 the acting mayor, [[J</span>
				<span class='text'>Erik Jonsson|Erik Jonsson]], began working to change the community's image</span>
				<span class='text'>Dallas was known and disliked as the city where the president had been killed, but Jonsson began a program designed to initiate a community renewal</span>
				<span class='text'>One of the goals was a new city hall, which could be a &quot;symbol of the people&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>123</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Jonsson, a co-founder of Texas Instruments, learned about Pei from his associate Cecil Howard Green, who had recruited the architect for MIT's Earth Sciences building</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>121–123</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Pei's approach to the new [[Dallas City Hall]] mirrored those of other projects; he surveyed the surrounding area and worked to make the building fit</span>
				<span class='text'>In the case of Dallas, he spent days meeting with residents of the city and was impressed by their civic pride</span>
				<span class='text'>He also found that the skyscrapers of the downtown business district dominated the skyline, and sought to create a building which could face the tall buildings and represent the importance of the public sector</span>
				<span class='text'>He spoke of creating &quot;a public-private dialogue with the commercial high-rises&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>125</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Working with his associate Theodore Musho, Pei developed a design centered on a building with a top much wider than the bottom; the facade leans at an angle of 34 degrees</span>
				<span class='text'>A plaza stretches out before the building, and a series of support columns holds it up</span>
				<span class='text'>It was influenced by Le Corbusier's [[Government of Chandigarh|High Court building in Chandigarh]], India; Pei sought to use the significant overhang to unify building and plaza</span>
				<span class='text'>The project cost much more than initially expected, and took 11 years</span>
				<span class='text'>Revenue was secured in part by including a subterranean parking garage</span>
				<span class='text'>The interior of the city hall is large and spacious; windows in the ceiling above the eighth floor fill the main space with light</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, pp</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>149</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;]]The city of Dallas received the building well, and a local television news crew found unanimous approval of the new city hall when it officially opened to the public in 1978</span>
				<span class='text'>Pei himself considered the project a success, even as he worried about the arrangement of its elements</span>
				<span class='text'>He said: &quot;It's perhaps stronger than I would have liked; it's got more strength than finesse</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;w136&quot;&gt;Quoted in Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>136</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He felt that his relative lack of experience left him without the necessary design tools to refine his vision, but the community liked the city hall enough to invite him back</span>
				<span class='text'>Over the years he went on to design five additional buildings in the Dallas area</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>136–137</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;====Hancock Tower, Boston====While Pei and Musho were coordinating the Dallas project, their associate [[Henry N</span>
				<span class='text'>Cobb|Henry Cobb]] had taken the helm for a commission in Boston</span>
				<span class='text'>[[John Hancock Insurance]] chairman Robert Slater hired I</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;M</span>

				<span class='text'>140 and 145</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;After the firm's first plan was discarded due to a need for more office space, Cobb developed a new plan around a towering parallelogram, slanted away from the [[Trinity Church (Boston)|Trinity Church]] and accented by a wedge cut into each narrow side</span>
				<span class='text'>To minimize the visual impact, the building was covered in large reflective glass panels; Cobb said this would make the building a &quot;background and foil&quot; to the older structures around it</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;]]In the mid-1960s, directors of the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> declared the need for a new building</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Paul Mellon]], a primary benefactor of the gallery and a member of its building committee, set to work with his assistant [[J</span>
				<span class='text'>Carter Brown]] (who became gallery director in 1969) to find an architect</span>
				<span class='text'>The new structure would be located to the east of the original building, and tasked with two functions: offer a large space for public appreciation of various popular collections; and house office space as well as archives for scholarship and research</span>
				<span class='text'>They likened the scope of the new facility to the [[Library of Alexandria]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After inspecting Pei's work at the [[Des Moines Art Center]] in Iowa and the [[Herbert F</span>
				<span class='text'>Johnson Museum of Art|Johnson Museum]] at [[Cornell University]], they offered him the commission</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>155–161</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Pei took to the project with vigor, and set to work with two young architects he had recently recruited to the firm, William Pedersen and [[Yann Weymouth]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Their first obstacle was the unusual shape of the building site, a [[trapezoid]] of land at the intersection of [[Constitution Avenue|Constitution]] and [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>|Pennsylvania Avenue]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>Inspiration struck Pei in 1968, when he scrawled a rough diagram of two triangles on a scrap of paper</span>
				<span class='text'>The larger building would be the public gallery; the smaller would house offices and archives</span>
				<span class='text'>This triangular shape became a singular vision for the architect</span>
				<span class='text'>As the date for groundbreaking approached, Pedersen suggested to his boss that a slightly different approach would make construction easier</span>
				<span class='text'>Pei simply smiled and said: &quot;No compromises</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>164–165</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The growing popularity of art museums presented unique challenges to the architecture</span>
				<span class='text'>Mellon and Pei both expected large crowds of people to visit the new building, and they planned accordingly</span>
				<span class='text'>To this end, he designed a large lobby roofed with enormous skylights</span>
				<span class='text'>Individual galleries are located along the periphery, allowing visitors to return after viewing each exhibit to the spacious main room</span>
				<span class='text'>A large [[Mobile (sculpture)|mobile sculpture]] by American artist [[Alexander Calder]] was later added to the lobby</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>179–180</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Pei hoped the lobby would be exciting to the public in the same way as the central room of the [[Solomon R</span>
				<span class='text'>Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] in New York</span>
				<span class='text'>The modern museum, he said later, &quot;must pay greater attention to its educational responsibility, especially to the young&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>To match the look and texture of the original gallery's marble walls, builders re-opened the quarry in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], from which the first batch of stone had been harvested</span>
				<span class='text'>The project even found and hired Malcolm Rice, a quarry supervisor who had overseen the original 1941 gallery project</span>
				<span class='text'>The marble was cut into three-inch-thick panels and arranged over the concrete foundation, with darker blocks at the bottom and lighter blocks on top</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>177–178</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The East Building was honored on May 30, 1978, two days before its public unveiling, with a black-tie party attended by celebrities, politicians, benefactors, and artists</span>
				<span class='text'>When the building opened, popular opinion was enthusiastic</span>
				<span class='text'>Large crowds visited the new museum, and critics generally voiced their approval</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Ada Louise Huxtable]] wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that Pei's building was &quot;a palatial statement of the creative accommodation of contemporary art and architecture&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;w182&quot;&gt;Quoted in Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>182</span>

				<span class='text'>68</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Some critics disliked the unusual design, however, and criticized the reliance on triangles throughout the building</span>
				<span class='text'>Others took issue with the large main lobby, particularly its attempt to lure casual visitors</span>
				<span class='text'>In his review for ''[[Artforum]]'', critic Richard Hennessy described a &quot;shocking fun-house atmosphere&quot; and &quot;aura of ancient Roman patronage&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;w182&quot;/&gt; One of the earliest and most vocal critics, however, came to appreciate the new gallery once he saw it in person</span>
				<span class='text'>Allan Greenberg had scorned the design when it was first unveiled, but wrote later to J</span>
				<span class='text'>Carter Brown: &quot;I am forced to admit that you are right and I was wrong! The building is a masterpiece</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>183</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Starting in 2005, the joints attaching the marble panels to the walls began to show signs of strain, creating a risk of panels falling off the building onto the public below</span>
				<span class='text'> In 2008 officials decided that it would be necessary to remove and reinstall ''all'' the panels</span>

				<span class='text'>One of these was a delegation of the [[American Institute of Architects]] in 1974, which Pei joined</span>
				<span class='text'>It was his first trip back to China since leaving in 1935</span>
				<span class='text'>He was favorably received, returned the welcome with positive comments, and a series of lectures ensued</span>
				<span class='text'>Pei noted in one lecture that since the 1950s Chinese architects had been content to imitate Western styles; he urged his audience in one lecture to search China's native traditions for inspiration</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|alt=A white building with ornamented windows faces a lake ringed with rock structures</span>
				<span class='text'>Trees appear around the structure</span>
				<span class='text'>Pei was surprised by public resistance to his traditional design of the hotel at [[Fragrant Hills]] in China</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Many people thought I was being reactionary,&quot; he said</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>193</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;]]In 1978 Pei was asked to initiate a project for his home country</span>
				<span class='text'>After surveying a number of different locations, Pei fell in love with a valley that had once served as an imperial garden and hunting preserve known as [[Fragrant Hills]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The site housed a decrepit hotel; Pei was invited to tear it down and build a new one</span>
				<span class='text'>As usual, he approached the project by carefully considering the context and purpose</span>
				<span class='text'>Likewise, he considered modernist styles inappropriate for the setting</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, he said, it was necessary to find &quot;a third way&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>192; Wiseman, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>189–92</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;After visiting his ancestral home in Suzhou, Pei created a design based on some simple but nuanced techniques he admired in traditional residential Chinese buildings</span>
				<span class='text'>Among these were abundant gardens, integration with nature, and consideration of the relationship between enclosure and opening</span>
				<span class='text'>Pei's design included a large central atrium covered by glass panels that functioned much like the large central space in his East Building of the National Gallery</span>
				<span class='text'>Openings of various shapes in walls invited guests to view the natural scenery beyond</span>
				<span class='text'>Younger Chinese who had hoped the building would exhibit some of Cubist flavor for which Pei had become known were disappointed, but the new hotel found more favour with government officials and architects</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>192–193</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The hotel, with 325 guest rooms and a four-story central atrium, was designed to fit perfectly into its natural habitat</span>
				<span class='text'>The trees in the area were of special concern, and particular care was taken to cut down as few as possible</span>
				<span class='text'>He worked with an expert from Suzhou to preserve and renovate a water maze from the original hotel, one of only five in the country</span>
				<span class='text'>Pei was also meticulous about the arrangement of items in the garden behind the hotel; he even insisted on transporting {{convert|230|ST|t}} of rocks from a location in southwest China to suit the natural aesthetic</span>
				<span class='text'>An associate of Pei's said later that he never saw the architect so involved in a project</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>201–203</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;During construction, a series of mistakes collided with the nation's lack of technology to strain relations between architects and builders</span>
				<span class='text'>Whereas 200&amp;nbsp;or so workers might have been used for a similar building in the US, the Fragrant Hill project employed over 3,000&amp;nbsp;workers</span>
				<span class='text'>This was mostly because the construction company lacked the sophisticated machines used in other parts of the world</span>
				<span class='text'>The problems continued for months, until Pei had an uncharacteristically emotional moment during a meeting with Chinese officials</span>
				<span class='text'>He later explained that his actions included &quot;shouting and pounding the table&quot; in frustration</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>205</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The design staff noticed a difference in the manner of work among the crew after the meeting</span>
				<span class='text'>As the opening neared, however, Pei found the hotel still needed work</span>
				<span class='text'>He began scrubbing floors with his wife and ordered his children to make beds and vacuum floors</span>
				<span class='text'>The project's difficulties took an emotional and physical strain on the Pei family</span>

				<span class='text'>Javits Convention Center]] in New York City, for which his associate [[James Ingo Freed|James Freed]] served as lead designer</span>
				<span class='text'>Hoping to create a vibrant community institution in a run-down neighborhood on Manhattan's west side, Freed developed a glass-coated structure with an intricate [[space frame]] of interconnected metal rods and spheres</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>211–216</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The convention center was plagued from the start by budget problems and construction blunders</span>
				<span class='text'>City regulations forbid a general contractor having final authority over the project, so architects and program manager Richard Kahan had to coordinate the wide array of builders, plumbers, electricians, and other workers</span>
				<span class='text'>The forged steel globes to be used in the space frame came to the site with hairline cracks and other defects; 12,000 were rejected</span>
				<span class='text'>These and other problems led to media comparisons with the disastrous Hancock Tower</span>
				<span class='text'>One New York City official blamed Kahan for the difficulties, indicating that the building's architectural flourishes were responsible for delays and financial crises</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The Javits Center opened on April 3, 1986, to a generally positive reception</span>

				<span class='text'>One of these was the renovation of the Louvre Museum</span>
				<span class='text'>Mitterrand appointed a civil servant named Emile Biasini to oversee it</span>
				<span class='text'>After visiting museums in Europe and the United States, including the US National Gallery, he asked Pei to join the team</span>
				<span class='text'>The architect made three secretive trips to Paris, to determine the feasibility of the project; only one museum employee knew why he was there</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>233; Boehm, p</span>
				<span class='text'>77</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Pei finally agreed that a reconstruction project was not only possible, but necessary for the future of the museum</span>
				<span class='text'>He thus became the first foreign architect to work on the Louvre</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>234</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The heart of the new design included not only a renovation of the ''Cour Napoléon'' in the midst of the buildings, but also a transformation of the interiors</span>
				<span class='text'>Pei proposed a central entrance, not unlike the lobby of the National Gallery East Building, which would link the three major buildings</span>
				<span class='text'>Below would be a complex of additional floors for research, storage, and maintenance purposes</span>
				<span class='text'>At the center of the courtyard he designed a [[Louvre Pyramid|glass and steel pyramid]], first proposed with the Kennedy Library, to serve as entrance and anteroom skylight</span>
				<span class='text'>It was mirrored by [[La Pyramide Inversée|another inverted pyramid]] underneath, to reflect sunlight into the room</span>
				<span class='text'>These designs were partly an homage to the fastidious geometry of the famous French landscape architect ''[[André Le Nôtre]]'' (1613–1700)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>235–236</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Pei also found the pyramid shape best suited for stable transparency, and considered it &quot;most compatible with the architecture of the Louvre, especially with the faceted planes of its roofs&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Boehm, p</span>
				<span class='text'>84&quot;/&gt;Biasini and Mitterrand liked the plans, but the scope of the renovation displeased Louvre director André Chabaud</span>
				<span class='text'>He resigned from his post, complaining that the project was &quot;unfeasible&quot; and posed &quot;architectural risks&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>240</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The public also reacted harshly to the design, mostly because of the proposed pyramid</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>249–250</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; One critic called it a &quot;gigantic, ruinous gadget&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;w249&quot;&gt;Quoted in Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>249</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; another charged Mitterrand with &quot;despotism&quot; for inflicting Paris with the &quot;atrocity&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;w249&quot;/&gt; Pei estimated that 90&amp;nbsp;percent of Parisians opposed his design</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;I received many angry glances in the streets of Paris,&quot; he said</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Boehm, p</span>
				<span class='text'>80</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Some condemnations carried [[nationalism|nationalistic]] overtones</span>
				<span class='text'>One opponent wrote: &quot;I am surprised that one would go looking for a Chinese architect in America to deal with the historic heart of the capital of France</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Boehm, p</span>
				<span class='text'>84&quot;/&gt;]]Soon, however, Pei and his team won the support of several key cultural icons, including the conductor [[Pierre Boulez]] and [[Claude Pompidou]], widow of former French President [[Georges Pompidou]], after whom [[Centre Georges Pompidou|another controversial museum]] was named</span>
				<span class='text'>In an attempt to soothe public ire, Pei took a suggestion from then-mayor of Paris [[Jacques Chirac]] and placed a full-sized cable model of the pyramid in the courtyard</span>
				<span class='text'>During the four days of its exhibition, an estimated 60,000&amp;nbsp;people visited the site</span>
				<span class='text'>Some critics eased their opposition after witnessing the proposed scale of the pyramid</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>251–252</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;To minimize the impact of the structure, Pei demanded a method of glass production that resulted in clear panes</span>
				<span class='text'>The pyramid was constructed at the same time as the subterranean levels below, which caused difficulties during the building stages</span>
				<span class='text'>As they worked, construction teams came upon an abandoned set of rooms containing 25,000&amp;nbsp;historical items; these were incorporated into the rest of the structure to add a new exhibition zone</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>257</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The new Louvre courtyard was opened to the public on October 14, 1988, and the Pyramid entrance was opened the following March</span>
				<span class='text'>By this time, public opinion had softened on the new installation; a poll found a fifty-six percent approval rating for the pyramid, with twenty-three percent still opposed</span>
				<span class='text'>The newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]]'' had vehemently criticized Pei's design, but later celebrated the tenth anniversary of its magazine supplement at the pyramid</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>263–264</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Dallas Meyerson Center 02</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|alt=A beige cube rises at an angle around a half-cone made of glass and steel</span>
				<span class='text'>In front, a square archway overlooks a stone courtyard</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he usually designed entirely by hand, Pei used a computer to &quot;confirm the spaces&quot; for the [[Morton H</span>
				<span class='text'>Meyerson Symphony Center]] in [[Dallas]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>272</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;]]One of the projects took Pei back to Dallas, Texas, to design the [[Morton H</span>
				<span class='text'>Meyerson Symphony Center]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The success of city's performing artists, particularly the [[Dallas Symphony Orchestra]] then being led by conductor [[Eduardo Mata]], led to interest by city leaders in creating a modern center for musical arts that could rival the best halls in [[Europe]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The organizing committee contacted 45&amp;nbsp;architects, but at first Pei did not respond, thinking that his work on the Dallas City Hall had left a negative impression</span>
				<span class='text'>One of his colleagues from that project, however, insisted that he meet with the committee</span>
				<span class='text'>He did and, although it would be his first concert hall, the committee voted unanimously to offer him the commission</span>
				<span class='text'>As one member put it: &quot;We were convinced that we would get the world's greatest architect putting his best foot forward</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>267</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The project presented a variety of specific challenges</span>
				<span class='text'>Because its main purpose was the presentation of live music, the hall needed a design focused on [[acoustics]] first, then public access and exterior aesthetics</span>
				<span class='text'>To this end, a professional sound technician was hired to design the interior</span>
				<span class='text'>He proposed a [[Shoebox style (architecture)|shoebox]] auditorium, used in the acclaimed designs of top European symphony halls such as the [[Concertgebouw|Amsterdam Concertgebouw]] and [[Musikverein|Vienna Musikverein]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Pei drew inspiration for his adjustments from the designs of the German architect [[Johann Balthasar Neumann]], especially the [[Basilica of the Fourteen Holy Helpers]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also sought to incorporate some of the panache of the [[Palais Garnier|Paris Opéra]] designed by [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>269–270</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Pei's design placed the rigid shoebox at an angle to the surrounding street grid, connected at the north end to a long rectangular office building, and cut through the middle with an assortment of circles and cones</span>
				<span class='text'>The design attempted to reproduce with modern features the acoustic and visual functions of traditional elements like [[filigree]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The project was risky: its goals were ambitious and any unforeseen acoustic flaws would be virtually impossible to remedy after the hall's completion</span>
				<span class='text'>Pei admitted that he did not completely know how everything would come together</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;I can imagine only 60&amp;nbsp;percent of the space in this building,&quot; he said during the early stages</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;The rest will be as surprising to me as to everyone else</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>272</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; As the project developed, costs rose steadily and some sponsors considered withdrawing their support</span>
				<span class='text'>Billionaire tycoon [[Ross Perot]] made a donation of US$10&amp;nbsp;million, on the condition that it be named in honor of Morton H</span>
				<span class='text'>Meyerson, the longtime patron of the arts in Dallas</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>273–274</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The building opened and immediately garnered widespread praise, especially for its acoustics</span>
				<span class='text'>After attending a week of performances in the hall, a music critic for ''The New York Times'' wrote an enthusiastic account of the experience and congratulated the architects</span>
				<span class='text'>One of Pei's associates told him during a party before the opening that the symphony hall was &quot;a very mature building&quot;; he smiled and replied: &quot;Ah, but did I have to wait this long?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>286</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;====Bank of China, Hong Kong====[[File:HK Bank of China Tower View</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|alt=A tall tower coated with reflective glass and steel X patterns rises over trees and smaller buildings</span>
				<span class='text'>Pei felt that his design for the [[Bank of China Tower, Hong Kong|Bank of China Tower]] in Hong Kong needed to reflect &quot;the aspirations of the Chinese people&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>288</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;]]A new offer had arrived for Pei from the Chinese government in 1982</span>
				<span class='text'>With an eye toward the [[transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong]] from the British in 1997, authorities in China sought Pei's aid on a new tower for the local branch of the [[Bank of China]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Chinese government was preparing for a new wave of engagement with the outside world and sought a tower to represent modernity and economic strength</span>
				<span class='text'>Given the elder Pei's history with the bank before the Communist takeover, government officials visited the 89-year-old man in New York to gain approval for his son's involvement</span>
				<span class='text'>Pei then spoke with his father at length about the proposal</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the architect remained pained by his experience with Fragrant Hill, he agreed to accept the commission</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>286–287</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The proposed site in Hong Kong's [[Central, Hong Kong|Central District]] was less than ideal; a tangle of highways lined it on three sides</span>
				<span class='text'>The area had also been home to a headquarters for Japanese military police during World War&amp;nbsp;II, and was notorious for prisoner torture</span>
				<span class='text'>The small parcel of land made a tall tower necessary, and Pei had usually shied away from such projects; in Hong Kong especially, the skyscrapers lacked any real architectural character</span>
				<span class='text'>Lacking inspiration and unsure of how to approach the building, Pei took a weekend vacation to the family home in [[Katonah, New York]]</span>
				<span class='text'>There he found himself experimenting with a bundle of sticks until he happened upon a cascading sequence</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>287–288</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The design that Pei developed for the [[Bank of China Tower, Hong Kong|Bank of China Tower]] was not only unique in appearance, but also sound enough to pass the city's rigorous standards for wind-resistance</span>
				<span class='text'>The tower was planned around a visible [[truss]] structure, which distributed stress to the four corners of the base</span>
				<span class='text'>Using the reflective glass that had become something of a trademark for him, Pei organized the facade around a series of boxed X shapes</span>
				<span class='text'>At the top, he designed the roofs at sloping angles to match the rising aesthetic of the building</span>
				<span class='text'>Some influential advocates of ''[[feng shui]]'' in Hong Kong and China criticized the design, and Pei and government officials responded with token adjustments</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>289–291</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;As the tower neared completion, Pei was shocked to witness the government's massacre of unarmed civilians at the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote an opinion piece for ''The New York Times'' titled &quot;China Won't Ever Be the Same&quot;, in which he said that the killings &quot;tore the heart out of a generation that carries the hope for the future of the country&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;WQ294&quot;&gt;Quoted in Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>294</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The massacre deeply disturbed his entire family, and he wrote that &quot;China is besmirched</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WQ294&quot;/&gt;===1990–present: museum projects===[[File:Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|alt=A grey tiled building rises over a lake, with a cylinder set on a narrow pole, and a sloping glass wall on one end</span>
				<span class='text'>One staff member sympathized with Pei's frustrations with the lack of organization at the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], admitting that he was &quot;operating in a vacuum&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;WQ307&quot;/&gt;]]As the 1990s began, Pei transitioned into a role of decreased involvement with his firm</span>
				<span class='text'>The staff had begun to shrink, and Pei wanted to dedicate himself to smaller projects allowing for more creativity</span>
				<span class='text'>Before he made this change, however, he set to work on his last major project as active partner: The [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in Cleveland, Ohio</span>
				<span class='text'>Considering his work on such bastions of [[high culture]] as the Louvre and US National Gallery, some critics were surprised by his association with what many considered a tribute to [[low culture]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The sponsors of the hall, however, sought Pei for specifically this reason; they wanted the building to have an aura of respectability from the beginning</span>
				<span class='text'>As in the past, Pei accepted the commission in part because of the unique challenge it presented</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>303–306</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Using a glass wall for the entrance, similar in appearance to his Louvre pyramid, Pei coated the exterior of the main building in white metal, and placed a large cylinder on a narrow perch to serve as a performance space</span>
				<span class='text'>The combination of off-centered wraparounds and angled walls was, Pei said, designed to provide &quot;a sense of tumultuous youthful energy, rebelling, flailing about&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>306</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The building opened in 1995, and was received with moderate praise</span>
				<span class='text'>''The New York Times'' called it &quot;a fine building&quot;, but Pei was among those who felt disappointed with the results</span>
				<span class='text'>The museum's early beginnings in New York combined with an unclear mission created a fuzzy understanding among project leaders for precisely what was needed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;WQ307&quot;&gt;Quoted in Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>307</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Although the city of Cleveland benefited greatly from the new tourist attraction, Pei was unhappy with it</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;WQ307&quot;/&gt;At the same time, Pei designed a new museum for [[Luxembourg]], the ''Musée d'art moderne Grand-Duc Jean'', commonly known as the [[Mudam]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Drawing from the original shape of the [[Fort Thüngen]] walls where the museum was located, Pei planned to remove a portion of the original foundation</span>
				<span class='text'>Public resistance to the historical loss forced a revision of his plan, however, and the project was nearly abandoned</span>
				<span class='text'>The size of the building was halved, and it was set back from the original wall segments to preserve the foundation</span>
				<span class='text'>Pei was disappointed with the alterations, but remained involved in the building process even during construction</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>311–313</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In 1995 Pei was hired to design an extension to the ''[[Deutsches Historisches Museum]]'', or German Historical Museum in Berlin</span>
				<span class='text'>Returning to the challenge of the East Building of the US National Gallery, Pei worked to combine a modernist approach with a classical main structure</span>
				<span class='text'>He described the glass cylinder addition as a &quot;beacon&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>315</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and topped it with a glass roof to allow plentiful sunlight inside</span>
				<span class='text'>Pei had difficulty working with German government officials on the project; their utilitarian approach clashed with his passion for aesthetics</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;They thought I was nothing but trouble&quot;, he said</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>316</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Pei also worked at this time on two projects for a [[Japanese new religions|new Japanese religious movement]] called ''[[Shinji Shumeikai]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>He was approached by the movement's spiritual leader, Kaishu Koyama, who impressed the architect with her sincerity and willingness to give him significant artistic freedom</span>
				<span class='text'>One of the buildings was a bell tower, designed to resemble the ''[[bachi]]'' used when playing traditional instruments like the ''[[shamisen]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Pei was unfamiliar with the movement's beliefs, but explored them in order to represent something meaningful in the tower</span>
				<span class='text'>As he said: &quot;It was a search for the sort of expression that is not at all technical</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>300</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Miho museum02n3872</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|alt=A curving circular tunnel opens to reveal a building with a tall sloping roof and a circular window in the front door</span>
				<span class='text'>Pei's tunnel through a mountain leading to the [[Miho Museum]] was partly inspired by a story from fourth-century Chinese poet [[Tao Yuanming]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Boehm, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>99–100</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;]]The experience was rewarding for Pei, and he agreed immediately to work with the group again</span>
				<span class='text'>The new project was the [[Miho Museum]], to display Koyama's collection of [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]] artifacts</span>
				<span class='text'>Pei visited the site in [[Shiga Prefecture]], and during their conversations convinced Koyama to expand her collection</span>
				<span class='text'>She conducted a global search and acquired more than 300&amp;nbsp;items showcasing the history of the [[Silk Road]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>317–319</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;One major challenge was the approach to the museum</span>
				<span class='text'>The Japanese team proposed a winding road up the mountain, not unlike the approach to the NCAR building in Colorado</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, Pei ordered a hole cut through a nearby mountain, connected to a major road via a bridge suspended from ninety-six steel cables and supported by a post set into the mountain</span>
				<span class='text'>The museum itself was built into the mountain, with 80&amp;nbsp;percent of the building underground</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>318–320</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;When designing the exterior, Pei borrowed from the tradition of Japanese temples, particularly those found in nearby [[Kyoto]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He created a concise spaceframe wrapped into French limestone and covered with a glass roof</span>
				<span class='text'>Pei also oversaw specific decorative details, including a bench in the entrance lobby, carved from a 350-year-old ''[[Zelkova serrata|keyaki]]'' tree</span>
				<span class='text'>Because of Koyama's considerable wealth, money was rarely considered an obstacle; estimates at the time of completion put the cost of the project at US$350&amp;nbsp;million</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>320–322</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;During the first decade of the 2000s, Pei designed a variety of buildings, including the [[Suzhou Museum]] near his childhood home</span>
				<span class='text'>He also designed the [[Museum of Islamic Art, Doha|Museum of Islamic Art]] in [[Doha]], [[Qatar]] at the request of [[Collecting practices of the Al-Thani Family|the Al-Thani Family]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Although it was originally planned for the [[corniche]] road along Doha Bay, Pei convinced project coordinators to build a new island to provide the needed space</span>
				<span class='text'>He then spent six months touring the region and surveying mosques in Spain, Syria, and Tunisia</span>
				<span class='text'>He was especially impressed with the elegant simplicity of the [[Mosque of Ibn Tulun]] in Cairo</span>
				<span class='text'>nce again, Pei sought to combine new design elements with the classical aesthetic most appropriate for the location of the building</span>
				<span class='text'>The rectangular boxes rotate evenly to create a subtle movement, with small arched windows at regular intervals into the limestone exterior</span>
				<span class='text'>The museum's coordinators were pleased with the project; its official website describes its &quot;true splendour unveiled in the sunlight&quot;, and speaks of &quot;the shades of colour and the interplay of shadows paying tribute to the essence of Islamic architecture&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>45–46</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He is known for combining traditional architectural elements with progressive designs based on simple geometric patterns</span>
				<span class='text'>As one critic writes: &quot;Pei has been aptly described as combining a classical sense of form with a contemporary mastery of method</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Heyer, p</span>
				<span class='text'>309</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, biographer Carter Wiseman called Pei &quot;the most distinguished member of his Late-Modernist generation still in practice&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>323&quot;&gt;Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>323</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Pei himself rejects simple dichotomies of architectural trends</span>
				<span class='text'>He once said: &quot;The talk about modernism versus [[postmodern architecture|post-modernism]] is unimportant</span>
				<span class='text'>It's a side issue</span>
				<span class='text'>An individual building, the style in which it is going to be designed and built, is not that important</span>
				<span class='text'>The important thing, really, is the community</span>
				<span class='text'>How does it affect life?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Diamonstein, p</span>
				<span class='text'>145</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Pei's work is celebrated throughout the world of architecture</span>
				<span class='text'>His colleague [[John Portman]] once told him: &quot;Just once, I'd like to do something like the East Building</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WQ215&quot;/&gt; But this originality does not always bring large financial reward; as Pei replied to the successful architect: &quot;Just once, I'd like to make the kind of money you do</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WQ215&quot;&gt;Quoted in Wiseman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>215</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; His concepts, moreover, are too individualized and dependent on context to give rise to a particular school of design</span>
				<span class='text'>Pei refers to his own &quot;analytical approach&quot; when explaining the lack of a &quot;Pei School&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;For me,&quot; he said, &quot;the important distinction is between a stylistic approach to the design; and an analytical approach giving the process of due consideration to time, place, and purpose&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>My analytical approach requires a full understanding of the three essential elements&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>to arrive at an ideal balance among them</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Boehm, p</span>
				<span class='text'>113</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;On a matter of personal style and his method of business negotiation, Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Pei once told a television reporter during an interview about an amusing event that happened in his career</span>
				<span class='text'>A client was inclined to disburse less treasure for a particular design, and the architect replied &quot;My name is I</span>
