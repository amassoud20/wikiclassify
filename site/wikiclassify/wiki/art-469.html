				<span class='text'>At the height of his power, his sultanate included Egypt, Syria, [[Mesopotamia]], [[Hejaz]], [[Yemen]] and other parts of [[North Africa]]</span>
				<span class='text'>riginally sent to [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid Egypt]] by his [[Zengid]] lord [[Nur ad-Din, atabeg of Aleppo|Nur ad-Din]] in 1163, Saladin climbed the ranks of the Fatimid government by virtue of his military successes against Crusader assaults on its territory and his personal closeness to the caliph [[al-Adid]]</span>
				<span class='text'>When Saladin's uncle [[Shirkuh]] died in 1169, al-Adid appointed Saladin [[vizier]], a rare nomination of a [[Sunni Muslim]] to such an important position in the [[Shia Islam|Shia Muslim]]-led [[caliphate]]</span>
				<span class='text'>During his term as vizier Saladin began to undermine the Fatimid establishment, and following al-Adid's death in 1171 he took over the government and realigned the country's allegiance with the [[Baghdad]]-based [[Abbasid Caliphate]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In the following years, he led forays against the Crusaders in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], ordered the successful conquest of [[Yemen]] and staved off pro-Fatimid rebellions in [[Upper Egypt]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ot long after the death of Nur ad-Din in 1174, Saladin personally led the conquest of Syria, peacefully entering [[Damascus]] at the request of its governor</span>
				<span class='text'>By mid-1175, Saladin had conquered [[Hama]] and [[Homs]], inviting the animosity of his former Zengid lords, who had been the official rulers of Syria</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon after, he defeated the Zengid army in battle at the [[Battle of the Horns of Hama|Horns of Hama]] and was thereafter proclaimed the &quot;Sultan of Egypt and Syria&quot; by the Abbasid caliph [[al-Mustadi]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He made further conquests in northern Syria and [[Al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]], escaping two attempts on his life by the [[Assassins]], before returning to Egypt in 1177 to address issues there</span>
				<span class='text'>By 1182, Saladin completed the conquest of Syria after capturing [[Aleppo]], but ultimately failed to take over the Zengid stronghold of [[Mosul]]</span>
				<span class='text'>nder Saladin's personal leadership, the Ayyubid army defeated the Crusaders at the decisive [[Battle of Hattin]] in 1187, leading the way to the Muslims' re-capture of Palestine from the Crusaders who had conquered it 88 years earlier</span>
				<span class='text'>Though the Crusader [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] would continue to exist for an extended period, its defeat at [[Hittin|Hattin]] marked a turning point in its conflict with the Muslim powers of the region</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1193 he died in Damascus, having given much of his wealth to his subjects</span>
				<span class='text'>He is buried in a [[Mausoleum of Saladin|mausoleum]] adjacent to the [[Umayyad Mosque]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In 1132 the defeated army of the [[Imad ad-Din Zengi]], the Lord of [[Mosul]], found their retreat blocked by the [[Tigris River]] opposite the Tikrit fortress where Saladin's father, [[Najm ad-Din Ayyub]] served as the warden</span>
				<span class='text'>Ayyub provided ferries for the army and gave them refuge in Tikrit</span>
				<span class='text'>Mujahed al-Din Bihruz, a former Greek slave who had been appointed the military governor of northern Mesopotamia for his service to the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuks]] had reprimanded Ayyub for giving Zengi refuge and in 1137, banished Ayyub from Tikrit after his brother [[Asad al-Din Shirkuh]] killed a friend of Bihruz in an [[Honor killing|honour killing]]</span>
				<span class='text'>According to [[Baha ad-Din ibn Shaddad]], Saladin was born the same night his family left Tikrit</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1139, Ayyub and his family moved to [[Mosul]] where Imad ad-Din Zengi acknowledged his debt and appointed Ayyub commander of his fortress in [[Baalbek]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After the death of Zengi in 1146, his son, [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nur ad-Din]], became the regent of [[Aleppo]] and the leader of the [[Zengid]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lyons|Jackson|1982|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;Saladin, who now lived in [[Damascus]], was reported to have a particular fondness of the city, but information on his early childhood is scarce</span>
				<span class='text'>About education, Saladin wrote &quot;children are brought up in the way in which their elders were brought up</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; According to one of his biographers, al-Wahrani, Saladin was able to answer questions on [[Euclid]], the [[Almagest]], arithmetic, and law, but this was an academic ideal and it was study of the [[Qur'an]] and the &quot;sciences of religion&quot; that linked him to his contemporaries</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons&quot; /&gt; Several sources claim that during his studies he was more interested in religion than joining the military</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Who2 Biography: Saladin, Sultan/Military Leader&quot; /&gt; In addition to Islam, Saladin had a knowledge of the genealogies, biographies, and histories of the [[Arab]]s, as well as the bloodlines of [[Arabian horse]]s</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Early expeditions==[[File:Statue of Saladin Damascus</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Equestrian [[statue of Saladin]] in the Citadel, Damascus, Syria]]Saladin's military career began under the tutelage of his uncle [[Shirkuh|Asad al-Din Shirkuh]], a prominent [[military commander]] under [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nur ad-Din]], Emir of Damascus and Aleppo, member of the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] [[Zengid dynasty]] and the most influential teacher of Saladin</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1163, the vizier to the [[Fatimid]] caliph [[al-Adid]], [[Shawar]], had been driven out of Egypt by rival Dirgham, a member of the powerful Banu Ruzzaik tribe</span>
				<span class='text'>He asked for military backing from Nur ad-Din, who complied and in 1164, sent Shirkuh to aid Shawar in his expedition against Dirgham</span>
				<span class='text'>Saladin, at age 26, went along with them</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lyons|Jackson|1982|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Shawar was successfully reinstated as vizier, he demanded that Shirkuh withdraw his army from Egypt for a sum of 30,000 [[dinar]]s, but he refused insisting it was Nur ad-Din's will that he remain</span>
				<span class='text'>Saladin's role in this expedition was minor, and it is known that he was ordered by Shirkuh to collect stores from [[Bilbais]] prior to its siege by a [[Crusader invasions of Egypt|combined force of Crusaders]] and Shawar's troops</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lyons|Jackson|1982|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;After the sacking of Bilbais, the Crusader-Egyptian force and Shirkuh's army were to engage in a battle on the desert border of the [[River Nile]], just west of [[Giza]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Saladin played a major role, commanding the right wing of the Zengid army (Muslim Dynasty of [[Oghuz Turk]] origin), while a force of [[Kurd]]s commanded the left, and Shirkuh stationed in the center</span>
				<span class='text'>Muslim sources at the time, however, put Saladin in the &quot;baggage of the centre&quot; with orders to lure the enemy into a trap by staging a false retreat</span>
				<span class='text'>The Crusader force enjoyed early success against Shirkuh's troops, but the terrain was too steep and sandy for their horses, and commander Hugh of Caesarea was captured while attacking Saladin's unit</span>
				<span class='text'>After scattered fighting in little valleys to the south of the main position, the Zengid central force returned to the offensive; Saladin joined in from the rear</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lyons|Jackson|1982|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;The battle ended in a Zengid victory, and Saladin is credited to have helped Shirkuh in one of the &quot;most remarkable victories in recorded history&quot;, according to [[Ibn al-Athir]], although more of Shirkuh's men were killed and the battle is considered by most sources as not a total victory</span>
				<span class='text'>Saladin and Shirkuh moved towards [[Alexandria]] where they were welcomed, given money, arms and provided a base</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lyons|Jackson|1982|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faced by a superior Crusader-Egyptian force who attempted to besiege the city, Shirkuh split his army</span>
				<span class='text'>He and the bulk of his force withdrew from Alexandria, while Saladin was left with the task of guarding the city</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lyons|Jackson|1982|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;==In Egypt=={{Main|Saladin in Egypt}}===Emir of Egypt===[[File:Saladin in Egypt Conquest</span>
				<span class='text'>ng|thumb|right|250px|Saladin's battles in [[Egypt]]]]Shirkuh was in a power struggle over Egypt with [[Shawar]] and [[Amalric I of Jerusalem|Amalric I]] of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], in which Shawar requested Amalric's assistance</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1169, Shawar was reportedly assassinated by Saladin, and Shirkuh died later that year</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lyons|Jackson|1982|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nur ad-Din chose a successor for Shirkuh, but al-Adid appointed Saladin to replace Shawar as vizier</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lyons|Jackson|1982|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;The reasoning behind the [[Shia]] caliph al-Adid's selection of Saladin, a Sunni, varies</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Ibn al-Athir]] claims that the caliph chose him after being told by his advisers that &quot;there is no one weaker or younger&quot; than Saladin, and &quot;not one of the emirs obeyed him or served him</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; However, according to this version, after some bargaining, he was eventually accepted by the majority of ''emirs''</span>
				<span class='text'>Al-Adid's advisers were also suspected of attempting to split the Syria-based Zengid ranks</span>
				<span class='text'>Al-Wahrani wrote that Saladin was selected because of the reputation of his family in their &quot;generosity and military prowess</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; [[Imad ad-Din al-Isfahani|Imad ad-Din]] wrote that after the brief mourning period of Shirkuh, during which &quot;opinions differed&quot;, the Zengid ''[[emir]]s'' decided upon Saladin and forced the caliph to &quot;invest him as vizier</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Although positions were complicated by rival Muslim leaders, the bulk of the Syrian rulers supported Saladin because of his role in the Egyptian expedition, in which he gained a record of military qualifications</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lyons|Jackson|1982|pp=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;Inaugurated as Emir on 26 March, Saladin repented &quot;wine-drinking and turned from frivolity to assume the dress of religion&quot;, according to Arabic sources of the time</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lyons|Jackson|1982|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having gained more power and independence than ever before in his career, he still faced the issue of ultimate loyalty between al-Adid and Nur ad-Din</span>
				<span class='text'>Later in the year, a group of Egyptian soldiers and ''emirs'' attempted to assassinate Saladin, but having already known of their intentions, thanks to his intelligence chief Ali bin Safyan, he had the chief conspirator, Naji, Mu'tamin al-Khilafa—the civilian controller of the Fatimid Palace—arrested and killed</span>
				<span class='text'>The day after, 50,000 black African soldiers from the [[regiment]]s of the Fatimid army opposed to Saladin's rule along with a number of Egyptian ''emirs'' and commoners staged a revolt</span>
				<span class='text'>By 23 August, Saladin had decisively quelled the uprising, and never again had to face a military challenge from [[Cairo]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lyons|Jackson|1982|pp=34–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;Towards the end of 1169, Saladin, with reinforcements from Nur ad-Din defeated a massive Crusader-[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] force near [[Damietta]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Afterward, in the spring of 1170, Nur ad-Din sent Saladin's father to Egypt in compliance with Saladin's request, as well as encouragement from the [[Baghdad]]-based [[Abbasid]] caliph, [[al-Mustanjid]], who aimed to pressure Saladin in deposing his rival caliph, al-Adid</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lyons|Jackson|1982|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saladin himself had been strengthening his hold on Egypt and widening his support base there</span>
				<span class='text'>He began granting his family members high-ranking positions in the region; he ordered the construction of a college for the [[Maliki]] branch of Sunni Islam in the city, as well as one for the [[Shafi'i]] denomination to which he belonged in [[al-Fustat]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lyons|Jackson|1982|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;After establishing himself in Egypt, Saladin launched a campaign against the Crusaders, besieging [[Deir al-Balah|Darum]] in 1170</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;LnY2&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lyons|Jackson|1982|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amalric withdrew his [[Knights Templars|Templar]] garrison from [[Gaza City|Gaza]] to assist him in defending Darum, but Saladin evaded their force and fell on Gaza instead</span>
				<span class='text'>He destroyed the town built outside the city's castle and killed most of its inhabitants after they were refused entry into the castle</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pringle, 1993, p</span>
				<span class='text'>08</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear exactly when, but during that same year, he attacked and captured the Crusader castle of [[Eilat]], built on an island off the head of the [[Gulf of Aqaba]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It did not pose a threat to the passage of the Muslim navy, but could harass smaller parties of Muslim ships and Saladin decided to clear it from his path</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|Saladin as depicted on a [[dirham]] coin, ca</span>
				<span class='text'>1190]]According to Imad ad-Din, Nur ad-Din wrote to Saladin in June 1171, telling him to reestablish the Abbasid caliphate in Egypt, which Saladin coordinated two months later after additional encouragement by Najm ad-Din al-Khabushani, the Shafi'i ''[[faqih]]'', who vehemently opposed Shia rule in the country</span>
				<span class='text'>Several Egyptian ''emirs'' were thus killed, but al-Adid was told that they were killed for rebelling against him</span>
				<span class='text'>He then fell ill, or was poisoned according to one account</span>
				<span class='text'>While ill, he asked Saladin to pay him a visit to request that he take care of his young children, but Saladin refused, fearing treachery against the Abbasids, and is said to have regretted his action after realizing what al-Adid had wanted</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lyons|Jackson|1982|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died on September 13 and five days later, the Abbasid ''[[khutba]]'' was pronounced in Cairo and al-Fustat, proclaiming [[al-Mustadi]] as caliph</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons46&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lyons|Jackson|1982|pp=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;On 25 September, Saladin left Cairo to take part in a joint attack on [[Kerak]] and [[Montreal (Crusader castle)|Montreal]], the desert castles of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], with Nur ad-Din who would attack from Syria</span>
				<span class='text'>Prior to arriving at Montreal, Saladin however withdrew back to Cairo as he received the reports that in his absence the Crusader Leaders had increased their support to the traitors inside Egypt to attack Saladin from within and lessen his power especially the Fatimid who started plotting to restore their past glory</span>
				<span class='text'>Because of this, Nur ad-Din went on alone</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Iltumish131&quot;&gt;''Dastan Iman Faroshon Ki'' by Inayatullah Iltumish, 2011, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>128—134&lt;/ref&gt;During the summer of 1173, a [[Nubia]]n army along with a contingent of [[Armenia]]n refugees were reported on the Egyptian border, preparing for a siege against [[Aswan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''emir'' of the city had requested Saladin's assistance and was given reinforcements under [[Turan-Shah]]—Saladin's brother</span>
				<span class='text'>Consequently, the [[Nubia]]ns departed, but returned in 1173 and were again driven off</span>
				<span class='text'>This time Egyptian forces advanced from Aswan and captured the Nubian town of [[Qasr Ibrim|Ibrim]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Saladin sent a gift to Nur ad-Din who had been his friend and teacher, 60,000 dinars, &quot;wonderful manufactured goods&quot;, some jewels, and an elephant</span>
				<span class='text'>While transporting these goods to Damascus, Saladin took the opportunity to ravage the Crusader countryside</span>
				<span class='text'>He did not press an attack against the desert castles, but attempted to drive out the Muslim Bedouins who lived in Crusader territory with the aim of depriving the Franks of guides</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lyons|Jackson|1982|pp=60–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;On 31 July 1173, Saladin's father Ayyub was wounded in a horse-riding accident, ultimately causing his death on 9 August</span>

				<span class='text'>=Conquest of Syria=====Conquest of Damascus===In the early summer of 1174, Nur ad-Din was mustering an army, sending summons to [[Mosul]], [[Diyarbakir]], and [[al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|al-Jazira]] in an apparent preparation of attack against Saladin's Egypt</span>
				<span class='text'>The Ayyubid dynasty held a council upon the revelation of his preparations to discuss the possible threat and Saladin collected his own troops outside Cairo</span>
				<span class='text'>On May 15, Nur ad-Din died after falling ill the previous week and his power was handed to his eleven-year-old son [[as-Salih Ismail al-Malik]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His death left Saladin with political independence and in a letter to as-Salih, he promised to &quot;act as a sword&quot; against his enemies and referred to the death of his father as an &quot;earthquake shock&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>3-74</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In the wake of Nur ad-Din's death, Saladin faced a difficult decision; he could move his army against the Crusaders from Egypt or wait until invited by as-Salih in Syria to come to his aid and launch a war from there</span>
				<span class='text'>He could also take it upon himself to annex Syria before it could possibly fall into the hands of a rival, but he feared that attacking a land that formerly belonged to his master—which is forbidden in the Islamic principles he believed—could portray him as hypocritical and thus making it unsuitable for leading the war against the Crusaders</span>
				<span class='text'>Saladin saw that in order to acquire Syria; he either needed an invitation from As-Salih or to warn him that potential anarchy could rise danger from the Crusaders</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lyons|Jackson|1982|pp=74–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;When as-Salih was removed to [[Aleppo]] in August, Gumushtigin, the ''emir'' of the city and a captain of Nur ad-Din's veterans assumed guardianship over him</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''emir'' prepared to unseat all of his rivals in Syria and al-Jazira, beginning with Damascus</span>
				<span class='text'>In this emergency, the ''emir'' of Damascus appealed to [[Ghazi II Saif ud-Din|Saif al-Din]] (a cousin of Gumushtigin) of [[Mosul]] for assistance against Aleppo, but he refused, forcing the Syrians to request the aid of Saladin who complied</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lane-Poole|1906|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saladin moved north towards Aleppo, besieging it on December 30 after Gumushtigin refused to abdicate his throne</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;LJ3&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lyons|Jackson|1982|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;Gumushtigin requested from [[Rashid ad-Din Sinan]], grand-master of the [[Hashshashin|Assassins]] of Syria, who were already at odds with Saladin since he replaced the Fatimids of Egypt, to assassinate Saladin in his camp</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;LJ4&quot;/&gt;Meanwhile, Saladin's rivals in Syria and Jazira waged a propaganda war against him, claiming he had &quot;forgotten his own condition [servant of Nur ad-Din]&quot; and showed no gratitude for his old master by besieging his son, rising &quot;in rebellion against his Lord</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Saladin aimed to counter this propaganda by ending the siege, claiming he was defending Islam from the Crusaders; his army returned to Hama to engage a Crusader force there</span>
				<span class='text'>The Crusaders withdrew beforehand and Saladin proclaimed it &quot;a victory opening the gates of men's hearts</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;LJ4&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lyons|Jackson|1982|pp=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, Saladin entered Homs and captured its citadel in March 1175, after stubborn resistance from its defenders</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lane-Poole|1906|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;Saladin's successes alarmed Saif al-Din</span>
				<span class='text'>As head of the [[Zengid]]s, including Gumushtigin, he regarded Syria and [[Mesopotamia]] as his family estate and was angered when Saladin attempted to usurp his dynasty's holdings</span>
				<span class='text'>Saif al-Din mustered a large army and dispatched it to Aleppo whose defenders anxiously had awaited them</span>
				<span class='text'>The combined forces of Mosul and Aleppo marched against Saladin in Hama</span>
				<span class='text'>Heavily outnumbered, Saladin initially attempted to make terms with the Zengids by abandoning all conquests north of the [[Jund Dimashq|Damascus province]], but they refused, insisting he return to Egypt</span>
				<span class='text'>Seeing that confrontation was unavoidable, Saladin prepared for battle, taking up a superior position at the [[Battle of the Horns of Hama|Horns of Hama]], hills by the gorge of the [[Orontes River]]</span>
				<span class='text'>On 13 April 1175, the Zengid troops marched to attack his forces, but soon found themselves surrounded by Saladin's Ayyubid veterans who crushed them</span>
				<span class='text'>The battle ended in a decisive victory for Saladin who pursued the Zengid fugitives to the gates of Aleppo, forcing as-Salih's advisers to recognize Saladin's control of the provinces of Damascus, Homs and Hama, as well as a number of towns outside Aleppo such as [[Ma'arat al-Numan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lane-Poole|1906|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;After his victory against the Zengids, Saladin proclaimed himself king and suppressed the name of as-Salih in [[Friday prayer]]s and Islamic coinage</span>
				<span class='text'>From then on, he ordered prayers in all the mosques of Syria and Egypt as the sovereign king and he issued at the Cairo mint gold coins bearing his official title—''al-Malik an-Nasir Yusuf Ayyub, ala ghaya'' &quot;the King Strong to Aid, Joseph son of Job; exalted be the standard</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The Abbasid caliph in Baghdad graciously welcomed Saladin's assumption of power and declared him &quot;Sultan of Egypt and Syria</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The Battle of Hama did not end the contest for power between the Ayyubids and the Zengids, with the final confrontation occurring in the spring of 1176</span>
				<span class='text'>Saladin had gathered massive reinforcements from Egypt while Saif al-Din was levying troops among the minor states of [[Diyarbakir]] and al-Jazira</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lane-Poole|1906|pp=141–143}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Saladin crossed the Orontes, leaving Hama, the sun was eclipsed</span>
				<span class='text'>He viewed this as an omen, but he continued his march north</span>
				<span class='text'>He reached the [[Tell Sultan|Sultan's Mound]], c</span>
				<span class='text'>25&amp;nbsp;km from Aleppo, where his forces encountered Saif al-Din's army</span>
				<span class='text'>A hand-to-hand fight ensued and the Zengids managed to plow Saladin's left wing, driving it before him, when Saladin himself charged at the head of the Zengid guard</span>
				<span class='text'>The Zengid forces panicked and most of Saif al-Din's officers ended up being killed or captured—Saif al-Din narrowly escaped</span>
				<span class='text'>The Zengid army's camp, horses, baggage, tents and stores were seized by the Ayyubids</span>
				<span class='text'>The Zengid [[prisoners of war]], however, were given gifts and freed</span>
				<span class='text'>All of the booty from the Ayyubid victory was accorded to the army, Saladin not keeping anything himself</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lane-Poole|1906|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;He continued towards Aleppo which still closed its gates to him, halting before the city</span>
				<span class='text'>On the way, his army took Buza'a, then captured [[Manbij]]</span>
				<span class='text'>From there they headed west to besiege the fortress of [[A'zaz]] on 15 May</span>
				<span class='text'>Several days later, while Saladin was resting in one of his captain's tents, an assassin rushed forward at him and struck at his head with a knife</span>
				<span class='text'>The cap of his head armour was not penetrated and he managed to grip the assassin's hand—the dagger only slashing his [[gambeson]]—and the assailant was soon killed</span>
				<span class='text'>Saladin was unnerved at the attempt on his life, which he accused Gumushtugin and the Assassins of plotting, and so increased his efforts in the siege</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;LP7&quot;/&gt;A'zaz capitulated on 21 June, and Saladin then hurried his forces to Aleppo to punish Gumushtigin</span>
				<span class='text'>His assaults were again resisted, but he managed to secure not only a truce, but a mutual alliance with Aleppo, in which Gumushtigin and as-Salih were allowed to continue their hold on the city and in return, they recognized Saladin as the sovereign over all of the dominions he conquered</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''emirs'' of [[Mardin]] and [[Hasankeyf|Keyfa]], the Muslim allies of Aleppo, also recognised Saladin as the King of Syria</span>
				<span class='text'>When the treaty was concluded, the younger sister of as-Salih came to Saladin and requested the return of the Fortress of A'zaz; he complied and escorted her back to the gates of Aleppo with numerous presents</span>

				<span class='text'>Based in the [[an-Nusayriyah Mountains]], they commanded nine fortresses, all built on high elevations</span>

				<span class='text'>He retreated the same month, after laying waste to the countryside, but failing to conquer any of the forts</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;LP4&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lane-Poole|1906|pp=149–150}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this version, one night Saladin's guards noticed a spark glowing down the hill of Masyaf and then vanishing among the Ayyubid tents</span>
				<span class='text'>Presently, Saladin awoke to find a figure leaving the tent</span>
				<span class='text'>He saw that the lamps were displaced and beside his bed laid hot scones of the shape peculiar to the Assassins with a note at the top pinned by a poisoned dagger</span>
				<span class='text'>The note threatened that he would be killed if he didn't withdraw from his assault</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Willey47&quot;/&gt; In reality, Saladin sought to form an alliance with Sinan and his Assassins, consequently depriving the Crusaders of a potent ally against him</span>

				<span class='text'>Having been absent roughly two years, he had much to organize and supervise in Egypt, namely fortifying and reconstructing Cairo</span>

				<span class='text'>In November 1177, he set out upon a raid into Palestine; the Crusaders had recently forayed into the territory of Damascus, so Saladin saw the truce as no longer worth preserving</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lyons|Jackson|1982|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;In the summer of 1179, King Baldwin had set up an outpost on the road to Damascus and aimed to fortify a passage over the [[Jordan River]], known as [[Jacob's Ford]], that commanded the approach to the [[Banias]] plain (the plain was divided by the Muslims and the Christians)</span>
				<span class='text'>Saladin had offered 100,000 [[gold]] pieces for Baldwin to abandon the project, which was particularly offensive to the Muslims, but to no avail</span>

				<span class='text'>Prior to his death, he had his chief officers swear an oath of loyalty to Izz al-Din, as he was the only Zengid ruler strong enough to oppose Saladin</span>
				<span class='text'>Izz al-Din was welcomed in Aleppo, but possessing it and Mosul put too great of a strain on his abilities</span>
				<span class='text'>He thus, handed Aleppo to his brother Imad al-Din Zangi, in exchange for [[Sinjar]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Saladin offered no opposition to these transactions in order to respect the treaty he previously made with the Zengids</span>

				<span class='text'>On the evening before he departed, he sat with his companions and the tutor of one of his sons quoted a line of poetry: &quot;enjoy the scent of the ox-eye plant of [[Najd]], for after this evening it will come no more</span>

				<span class='text'>In July, Saladin dispatched Farrukh-Shah to attack [[Kawkab al-Hawa]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Later, in August, the Ayyubids launched a naval and ground assault to capture [[Beirut]]; Saladin led his army in the [[Bekaa Valley]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The assault was leaning towards failure and Saladin abandoned the operation to focus on issues in [[Mesopotamia]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;LP9&quot;/&gt;Once he reached Bira, near the river, he was joined by Kukbary and Nur al-Din of Hisn Kayfa and the combined forces captured the cities of Jazira, one after the other</span>

				<span class='text'>Upon seeing the large size of Saladin's army, he made little effort to resist and surrendered on the condition that he would retain his property</span>
				<span class='text'>Saladin promptly impressed the inhabitants of the town by publishing a decree that ordered a number of taxes to be canceled and erased all mention of them from treasury records, stating &quot;the most miserable rulers are those whose purses are fat and their people thin</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; From ar-Raqqah, he moved to conquer al-Fudain, al-Husain, Maksim, Durain, 'Araban, and Khabur—all of which swore allegiance to him</span>

				<span class='text'>A siege was set, but the governor of Tell Khalid surrendered upon the arrival of Saladin himself on May 17 before a siege could take place</span>

				<span class='text'>On May 21, he camped outside the city, positioning himself east of the [[Citadel of Aleppo]], while his forces encircles the suburb of Banaqusa to the northeast and [[Bab al-Jinan|Bab Janan]] to the west</span>
				<span class='text'>He stationed his men dangerously close to the city, hoping for an early success</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lyons|Jackson|1982|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;Zangi did not offer long resistance</span>
				<span class='text'>He was unpopular with his subjects and wished to return to his Sinjar, the city he governed previously</span>
				<span class='text'>An exchange was negotiated where Zangi would hand over Aleppo to Saladin in return for the restoration of his control of Sinjar, Nusaybin, and ar-Raqqa</span>
				<span class='text'>Zangi would hold these territories as Saladin's vassals on terms of military service</span>
				<span class='text'>On June 12, Aleppo was formally placed in Ayyubid hands</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lane-Poole|1906|pp=172–173}}&lt;/ref&gt; The people of Aleppo had not known about these negotiations and were taken by surprise when Saladin's standard was hoisted over the citadel</span>
				<span class='text'>Two ''emir''s, including an old friend of Saladin, Izz al-Din Jurduk, welcomed and pledged their service to him</span>
				<span class='text'>Saladin replaced the [[Hanafi]] courts with Shafi'i administration, despite a promise he would not interfere in the religious leadership of the city</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he was short of money, Saladin also allowed the departing Zangi to take all the stores of the citadel that he could travel with and to sell the remainder—which Saladin purchased himself</span>
				<span class='text'>In spite of his earlier hesitation to go through with the exchange, he had no doubts about his success, stating that Aleppo was &quot;the key to the lands&quot; and &quot;this city is the eye of Syria and the citadel is its pupil</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lyons|Jackson|1982|p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Saladin, the capture of the city marked the end of over eight years of waiting since he told Farrukh-Shah that ''&quot;we have only to do the milking and Aleppo will be ours&quot;''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lyons|Jackson|1982|pp=198–201}}&lt;/ref&gt;After spending one night in Aleppo's citadel, Saladin marched to Harim, near the Crusader-held [[Antioch]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The city was held by Surhak, a &quot;minor ''[[mamluk]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Saladin offered him the city of [[Bosra|Busra]] and property in Damascus in exchange for [[Harem, Syria|Harim]], but when Surhak asked for more, his own garrison in Harim forced him out</span>
				<span class='text'>He was arrested by Saladin's deputy Taqi al-Din on allegations that he was planning to cede Harim to [[Bohemond III, Prince of Antioch|Bohemond III of Antioch]]</span>
				<span class='text'>When Saladin received its surrender, he proceeded to arrange the defense of Harim from the Crusaders</span>
				<span class='text'>He reported to the caliph and his own subordinates in Yemen and [[Baalbek]] that was going to attack the [[Armenia]]ns</span>
				<span class='text'>Before he could move, however, there were a number of administrative details to be settled</span>
				<span class='text'>Saladin agreed to a truce with Bohemond in return for Muslim prisoners being held by him and then he gave A'zaz to Alam ad-Din Suleiman and Aleppo to Saif al-Din al-Yazkuj—the former was an ''emir'' of Aleppo who joined Saladin and the latter was a former ''mamluk'' of Shirkuh who helped rescue him from the assassination attempt at A'zaz</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|199px|Sculpture of Saladin in the [[Egyptian Military museum]] in [[Cairo]]]]As Saladin approached Mosul, he faced the issue of taking over a large city and justifying the action</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lyons|Jackson|1982|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Zengids of Mosul appealed to [[an-Nasir]], the Abbasid caliph at Baghdad whose vizier favored them</span>
				<span class='text'>An-Nasir sent Badr al-Badr (a high-ranking religious figure) to mediate between the two sides</span>
				<span class='text'>Saladin arrived at the city on 10 November 1182</span>
				<span class='text'>Izz al-Din would not accept his terms because he considered them disingenuous and extensive, and Saladin immediately laid siege to the heavily fortified city</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lyons|Jackson|1982|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;After several minor skirmishes and a stalemate in the siege that was initiated by the caliph, Saladin intended to find a way to withdraw without damage to his reputation while still keeping up some military pressure</span>
				<span class='text'>He decided to attack Sinjar, which was held by Izz al-Din's brother Sharaf al-Din</span>
				<span class='text'>It fell after a 15-day siege on December 30</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lyons|Jackson|1982|pp=180–181}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saladin's soldiers broke their discipline, plundering the city; Saladin only managed to protect the governor and his officers by sending them to Mosul</span>
				<span class='text'>After establishing a garrison at Sinjar, he awaited a coalition assembled by Izz al-Din consisting of his forces, those from Aleppo, Mardin, and [[Armenia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lane-Poole|1906|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saladin and his army met the coalition at Harran in February 1183, but on hearing of his approach, the latter sent messengers to Saladin asking for peace</span>
				<span class='text'>Each force returned to their cities and al-Fadil wrote: ''&quot;They [Izz al-Din's coalition] advanced like men, like women they vanished</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;'' {{citation needed|date=September 2013}}On 2 March, al-Adil from Egypt wrote to Saladin that the Crusaders had struck the &quot;heart of Islam</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; [[Crusader raids on the Red Sea|Raynald de Châtillon had sent ships]] to the [[Gulf of Aqaba]] to raid towns and villages off the coast of the [[Red Sea]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It was not an attempt to extend the Crusader influence into that sea or to capture its trade routes, but merely a piratical move</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lyons|Jackson|1982|p=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Imad al-Din writes the raid was alarming to the Muslims because they were not accustomed to attacks on that sea, and Ibn al-Athir adds that the inhabitants had no experience with the Crusaders either as fighters or traders</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lyons|Jackson|1982|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Ibn Jubair]] was told that sixteen Muslim ships were burnt by the Crusaders who then captured a pilgrim ship and caravan at [[Aidab]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also reported they intended to attack [[Medina]] and remove [[Muhammad]]'s body</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Al-Maqrizi]] added to the rumor by claiming Muhammad's tomb was going to be relocated to Crusader territory so Muslims would make pilgrimages there</span>
				<span class='text'>Fortunately for Saladin, al-Adil had his warships moved from Fustat and Alexandria to the Red Sea under the command of an Armenian mercenary Lu'lu</span>
				<span class='text'>They broke the Crusader blockade, destroyed most of their ships, and pursued and captured those who anchored and fled into the desert</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lyons|Jackson|1982|p=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surviving Crusaders, numbered at 170, were ordered to be killed by Saladin in various Muslim cities</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lyons|Jackson|1982|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;From the point of view of Saladin, in terms of territory, the war against Mosul was going well, but he still failed to achieve his objectives and his army was shrinking; Taqi al-Din took his men back to Hama, while Nasir al-Din Muhammad and his forces had left</span>
				<span class='text'>This encouraged Izz al-Din and his allies to take the offensive</span>
				<span class='text'>The previous coalition regrouped at Harzam some 140&amp;nbsp;km from Harran</span>
				<span class='text'>In early April, without waiting for Nasir al-Din, Saladin and Taqi al-Din commenced their advance against the coalition, marching eastward to Ras al-Ein unhindered</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lyons|Jackson|1982|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; By late April, after three days of &quot;actual fighting&quot;, according to Saladin, the Ayyubids had captured [[Amid]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He handed the city to Nur al-Din Muhammad together with its stores, which consisted of 80,000 candles, a tower full of arrowheads, and 1,040,000 books</span>
				<span class='text'>In return for a diploma granting him the city, Nur al-Din swore allegiance to Saladin, promising to follow him in every expedition in the war against the Crusaders, and repairing damage done to the city</span>
				<span class='text'>The fall of Amid, in addition to territory, convinced Il-Ghazi of Mardin to enter the service of Saladin, weakening Izz al-Din's coalition</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lyons|Jackson|1982|p=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;Saladin attempted to gain the Caliph an-Nasir's support against Izz al-Din by sending him a letter requesting a document that would give him legal justification for taking over Mosul and its territories</span>
				<span class='text'>Saladin aimed to persuade the caliph claiming that while he conquered Egypt and Yemen under the flag of the Abbasids, the Zengids of Mosul openly supported the Seljuks (rivals of the caliphate) and only came to the caliph when in need</span>
				<span class='text'>He also accused Izz al-Din's forces of disrupting the Muslim &quot;Holy War&quot; against the Crusaders, stating &quot;they are not content not to fight, but they prevent those who can</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Saladin defended his own conduct claiming that he had come to Syria to fight the Crusaders, end the heresy of the Assassins, and stop the wrong-doing of the Muslims</span>
				<span class='text'>He also promised that if Mosul was given to him, it would lead to the capture of Jerusalem, [[Constantinople]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], and the lands of the [[Almohad]]s in the [[Maghreb]], &quot;until the word of God is supreme and the Abbasid caliphate has wiped the world clean, turning the churches into mosques</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Saladin stressed that all this would happen by the will of God, and instead of asking for financial or military support from the caliph, he would capture and give the caliph the territories of [[Tikrit]], [[Daquq]], [[Khuzestan]], [[Kish Island]], and [[Oman]]</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Saladin and [[Guy of Lusignan]] after [[Battle of Hattin]]]]On 29 September 1182, Saladin crossed the [[Jordan River]] to attack [[Beisan]], which was found to be empty</span>
				<span class='text'>The next day his forces sacked and burned the town and moved westwards</span>
				<span class='text'>They intercepted Crusader reinforcements from Karak and [[Shaubak]] along the [[Nablus]] road and took a number of prisoners</span>
				<span class='text'>Meanwhile, the main Crusader force under [[Guy of Lusignan]] moved from [[Tzippori|Sepphoris]] to [[Afula|al-Fula]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Saladin sent out 500 skirmishers to harass their forces, and he himself marched to [[Ain Jalut]]</span>
				<span class='text'>When the Crusader force—reckoned to be the largest the kingdom ever produced from its own resources, but still outmatched by the Muslims—advanced, the Ayyubids unexpectedly moved down the stream of Ain Jalut</span>
				<span class='text'>After a few Ayyubid raids—including attacks on [[Zir'in]], [[Taibe, Galilee|Forbelet]], and [[Mount Tabor]]—the Crusaders still were not tempted to [[Battle of Al-Fule (1183)|attack their main force]], and Saladin led his men back across the river once provisions and supplies ran low</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons202&quot;/&gt;Crusader attacks provoked further responses by Saladin</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Raynald of Châtillon]], in particular, harassed Muslim [[Trade|trading]] and [[pilgrimage]] routes with a fleet on the [[Red Sea]], a water route that Saladin needed to keep open</span>
				<span class='text'>In response, Saladin built a fleet of 30 galleys to attack [[Beirut]] in 1182</span>
				<span class='text'>Raynald threatened to attack the holy cities of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In retaliation, Saladin twice [[Siege of Kerak|besieged Kerak]], Raynald's fortress in [[Oultrejordain]], in 1183 and 1184</span>
				<span class='text'>Raynald responded by looting a caravan of pilgrims on the [[Hajj]] in 1185</span>
				<span class='text'>According to the later 13th-century ''Old French Continuation of William of Tyre'', Raynald captured Saladin's sister in a raid on a caravan; this claim is not attested in contemporary sources, Muslim or Frankish, however, instead stating that Raynald had attacked a preceding caravan, and Saladin set guards to ensure the safety of his sister and her son, who came to no harm</span>
				<span class='text'>ollowing the failure of his Kerak sieges, Saladin temporarily turned his attention back to another long-term project and resumed attacks on the territory of ʻIzz ad-Dīn (Masʻūd ibn Mawdūd ibn Zangi), around [[Mosul]], which he had begun with some success in 1182</span>
				<span class='text'>However, since then, Masʻūd had allied himself with the powerful governor of [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Jibal]], who in 1185 began moving his troops across the [[Zagros Mountains]], causing Saladin to hesitate in his attacks</span>
				<span class='text'>The defenders of Mosul, when they became aware that help was on the way, increased their efforts, and Saladin subsequently fell ill, so in March 1186 a peace treaty was signed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bosworth, 1989, p</span>
				<span class='text'>781&lt;/ref&gt;In July 1187 Saladin captured most of the Kingdom of Jerusalem</span>
				<span class='text'>On July 4, 1187, at the [[Battle of Hattin]], he faced the combined forces of [[Guy of Lusignan]], [[King Consort]] of Jerusalem, and [[Raymond III of Tripoli]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In this battle alone the Crusader force was largely annihilated by Saladin's determined army</span>
				<span class='text'>It was a major disaster for the Crusaders and a turning point in the history of the Crusades</span>
				<span class='text'>Saladin captured Raynald and was personally responsible for his [[execution]] in retaliation for his attacks against Muslim caravans</span>
				<span class='text'>The members of these caravans had, in vain, besought his mercy by reciting the truce between the Muslims and the Crusaders, but Raynald ignored this and insulted the Islamic prophet, [[Muhammad]], before murdering and torturing a number of them</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon hearing this, Saladin swore an oath to personally execute Raynald</span>

				<span class='text'>Saladin preferred to take [[Jerusalem]] without bloodshed and offered generous terms, but those inside refused to leave their holy city, vowing to destroy it in a fight to the death rather than see it handed over peacefully</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Jerusalem]] capitulated to his forces on Friday, 2 October 1187, after a [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|siege]]</span>
				<span class='text'>When the siege had started, Saladin was unwilling{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} to promise terms of quarter to the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem#Population|Frankish]] inhabitants of Jerusalem</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Balian of Ibelin]] threatened to kill every Muslim hostage, estimated at 5,000, and to destroy Islam's holy shrines of the [[Dome of the Rock]] and the [[al-Aqsa Mosque]] if such quarter were not provided</span>
				<span class='text'>Saladin consulted his council and the terms were accepted</span>
				<span class='text'>The agreement was read out through the streets of Jerusalem so that everyone might within forty days provide for himself and pay to Saladin the agreed tribute for his freedom</span>

				<span class='text'>Although Saladin faded into history after the [[Middle Ages]], he appears in a sympathetic light in [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]'s play ''[[Nathan the Wise]]'' (1779) and in Sir [[Walter Scott]]'s novel ''[[The Talisman (Scott novel)|The Talisman]]'' (1825)</span>
				<span class='text'>The contemporary view of Saladin originates mainly from these texts</span>
				<span class='text'>According to [[Jonathan Riley-Smith]], Scott's portrayal of Saladin was that of a &quot;modern [19th-century] liberal European gentlemen, beside whom medieval Westerners would always have made a poor showing</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Riley Smith, Jonathan, &quot;The Crusades, Christianity and Islam&quot;, (Columbia 2008), p</span>
				<span class='text'>67&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the Crusaders' slaughter when they originally conquered Jerusalem in 1099, Saladin granted amnesty and free passage to all common [[Catholics]] and even to the defeated Christian army, as long as they were able to pay the aforementioned ransom (the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] Christians were treated even better, because they often opposed the western Crusaders)</span>
				<span class='text'>An interesting view of Saladin and the world in which he lived is provided by [[Tariq Ali]]'s novel ''The Book of Saladin''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;(London: Verso, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;Notwithstanding the differences in beliefs, the Muslim Saladin was respected by Christian lords, Richard especially</span>
				<span class='text'>Richard once praised Saladin as a great prince, saying that he was without doubt the greatest and most powerful leader in the Islamic world</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lyons|Jackson|1982|p=357}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saladin in turn stated that there was not a more honorable Christian lord than Richard</span>
				<span class='text'>After the treaty, Saladin and Richard sent each other many gifts as tokens of respect but never met face to face</span>
				<span class='text'>In April 1191, a Frankish woman's three-month-old baby had been stolen from her camp and had been sold on the market</span>
				<span class='text'>The Franks urged her to approach Saladin herself with her grievance</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Bahā' al-Dīn, Saladin used his own money to buy the child back:{{quote|He gave it to the mother and she took it; with tears streaming down her face, and hugged the baby to her chest</span>
				<span class='text'>The people were watching her and weeping and I (Ibn Shaddad) was standing amongst them</span>

				<span class='text'>According to some sources, after his triumphal entry into the city, Allenby raised his sword in salute to the famous statue of Saladin and proudly declared, &quot;Today the wars of the Crusaders are completed</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; This quotation was incorrectly attributed to Allenby, and throughout his life he vehemently protested against his conquest of Palestine in 1917 having been called a &quot;Crusade</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; In 1933 Allenby reiterated this stance by saying: &quot;The importance of Jerusalem lay in its strategic importance, there was no religious impulse in this campaign</span>

				<span class='text'>lthough the [[Ayyubid dynasty]] that he founded would only outlive him by 57 years, the legacy of Saladin within the [[Arab World]] continues to this day</span>
				<span class='text'>With the rise of [[Arab nationalism]] in the 20th Century, particularly with regard to the [[Arab-Israeli conflict]], Saladin's heroism and leadership gained a new significance</span>
				<span class='text'>Saladin's recapture of Palestine from the [[Crusaders|European Crusaders]] is considered an inspiration for modern-day Arabs' opposition to [[Zionism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, the glory and comparative unity of the Arab World under Saladin was seen as the perfect symbol for the new unity sought by Arab nationalists, such as [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]</span>
				<span class='text'>For this reason, the [[Coat of arms of Egypt|Eagle of Saladin]] became the symbol of revolutionary Egypt, and was subsequently adopted by several other Arab states (the [[Coat of arms of the United Arab Emirates|United Arab Republic]], [[Coat of arms of Iraq|Iraq]], [[Coat of arms of Libya#Libya under Gaddafi|Libya]], the [[Coat of arms of Palestine|State of Palestine]], and [[Coat of arms of Yemen|Yemen]])</span>
