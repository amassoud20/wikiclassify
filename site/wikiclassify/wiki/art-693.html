				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|230px|Thomas Hardy aged 70, by William Strang]]'''Thomas Hardy''', [[Order of Merit|OM]] (2 June 1840 – 11 January 1928) was an English novelist and poet</span>
				<span class='text'> A [[Literary realism|Victorian realist]] in the tradition of [[George Eliot]], he was influenced both in his novels and in his poetry by [[Romanticism]], especially [[William Wordsworth]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Like Dickens, he was highly critical of much in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] society, though Hardy focused more on a declining rural society</span>
				<span class='text'>hile Hardy wrote poetry throughout his life and regarded himself primarily as a poet, his first collection was not published until 1898</span>
				<span class='text'>Initially, therefore, he gained fame as the author of novels, including ''[[Far from the Madding Crowd]]'' (1874), ''[[The Mayor of Casterbridge]]'' (1886),  ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'' (1891), and ''[[Jude the Obscure]]'' (1895)</span>
				<span class='text'> Hardy's poetry, though prolific, was not as well received during his lifetime</span>
				<span class='text'> It was rediscovered in the 1950s, when Hardy's poetry had a significant influence on the [[The Movement (literature)|Movement]] poets of the 1950s and 1960s, including [[Philip Larkin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Davie]] (1973),''Thomas Hardy and British Poetry'', London: [[Routledge|Routledge and Kegan Paul]]&lt;/ref&gt;Most of his fictional works – initially published as serials in magazines – were set in the semi-fictional region of [[Thomas Hardy's Wessex|Wessex]]</span>
				<span class='text'> They explored tragic characters struggling against their passions and social circumstances</span>
				<span class='text'>Hardy's Wessex is based on [[Wessex|the medieval Anglo-Saxon kingdom]] and eventually came to include the counties of Dorset, Wiltshire, Somerset, Devon, Hampshire and much of Berkshire, in southwest and south central England</span>
				<span class='text'>=Life==Thomas Hardy was born in 1840 in Higher Bockhampton (Upper Bockhampton in his day), a hamlet in the parish of [[Stinsford]] to the east of [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]] in Dorset, England, where his father Thomas (1811–1892) worked as a stonemason and local builder</span>
				<span class='text'>His mother Jemima (née Hand;&lt;ref&gt;http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>For several years he attended Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Last's Academy for Young Gentlemen in Dorchester</span>
				<span class='text'>Here he learned Latin and demonstrated academic potential</span>

				<span class='text'>0,36</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Hardy trained as an architect in Dorchester before moving to London in 1862; there he enrolled as a student at [[King's College London]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He won prizes from the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] and the [[Architectural Association School of Architecture|Architectural Association]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Hardy was in charge of the excavation of the graveyard of [[St Pancras Old Church]] prior to its destruction when the [[Midland Railway]] was extended to a new terminus at [[St Pancras railway station|St Pancras]]</span>

				<span class='text'>However, during this time he became interested in social reform and the works of [[John Stuart Mill]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was also introduced by his Dorset friend [[Horatio Mosley Moule|Horace Moule]] to the works of [[Charles Fourier]] and [[Auguste Comte]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Five years later, concerned about his health, he returned to Dorset, settling at Weymouth, and decided to dedicate himself to writing</span>

				<span class='text'>Although they later became estranged, her subsequent death in 1912 had a traumatic effect on him and after her death, Hardy made a trip to Cornwall to revisit places linked with their courtship; his ''[[Poems 1912–13]]'' reflect upon her death</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1914, Hardy married his secretary [[Florence Dugdale|Florence Emily Dugdale]], who was 39 years his junior</span>

				<span class='text'>His funeral was on 16 January at [[Westminster Abbey]], and it proved a controversial occasion because Hardy had wished for his body to be interred at Stinsford in the same grave as his first wife, Emma</span>
				<span class='text'>His family and friends concurred; however, his executor, Sir [[Sydney Carlyle Cockerell]], insisted that he be placed in the abbey's famous [[Poets' Corner]]</span>

				<span class='text'>]Hardy's first novel, ''[[The Poor Man and the Lady]]'', finished by 1867, failed to find a publisher</span>
				<span class='text'>He then showed it to his mentor and friend, the Victorian poet and novelist, [[George Meredith]], who felt that ''The Poor Man and the Lady'' would be too politically controversial and might damage Hardy's ability to publish in the future</span>
				<span class='text'>So Hardy followed his advice and he did not try further to publish it</span>
				<span class='text'>Later, he destroyed the manuscript</span>
				<span class='text'>fter he abandoned his first novel, Hardy wrote two new ones that he hoped would have more commercial appeal, ''[[Desperate Remedies]]'' (1871) and ''[[Under the Greenwood Tree]]'' (1872), both of which were published anonymously</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1873 ''[[A Pair of Blue Eyes]]'', a novel drawing on Hardy's courtship of his first wife, was published under his own name</span>
				<span class='text'>The term &quot;[[cliffhanger]]&quot; is considered to have originated with the serialised version of this story (which was published in ''[[William Tinsley (publisher)|Tinsley's Magazine]]'' between September 1872 and July 1873) in which Henry Knight, one of the protagonists, is left literally hanging off a cliff</span>
				<span class='text'>n his next novel ''[[Far from the Madding Crowd]]'' (1874), Hardy first introduced the idea of calling the region in the west of England, where his novels are set, [[Thomas Hardy's Wessex|Wessex]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Wessex had been the name of an early [[Saxon]] kingdom, in approximately the same part of England</span>
				<span class='text'>''Far from the Madding Crowd'' was successful enough for Hardy to give up architectural work and pursue a literary career</span>
				<span class='text'>Over the next twenty-five years Hardy produced ten more novels</span>
				<span class='text'>ubsequently the Hardys moved from London to [[Yeovil]], and then to [[Sturminster Newton]], where he wrote ''[[The Return of the Native]]'' (1878)</span>
				<span class='text'>Hardy published ''[[Two on a Tower]]'' in 1882, a romance story set in the world of [[astronomy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Then in 1885, they moved for the last time, to [[Max Gate]], a house outside Dorchester designed by Hardy and built by his brother</span>
				<span class='text'>There he wrote ''[[The Mayor of Casterbridge]]'' (1886), ''[[The Woodlanders]]'' (1887), and ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'' (1891), the last of which attracted criticism for its sympathetic portrayal of a &quot;fallen woman&quot; and was initially refused publication</span>
				<span class='text'>Its subtitle, ''A Pure Woman: Faithfully Presented'', was intended to raise the eyebrows of the Victorian middle classes</span>

				<span class='text'>]''[[Jude the Obscure]]'', published in 1895, met with an even stronger negative response from the Victorian public because of its controversial treatment of sex, religion and marriage</span>
				<span class='text'>Furthermore, its apparent attack on the institution of marriage caused further strain on Hardy's already difficult marriage because Emma Hardy was concerned that ''Jude the Obscure'' would be read as autobiographical</span>
				<span class='text'>Some booksellers sold the novel in brown paper bags, and the [[Bishop of Wakefield]], [[Walsham How]], is reputed to have burnt his copy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;BBC200803&quot;/&gt; In his postscript of 1912, Hardy humorously referred to this incident as part of the career of the book: &quot;After these [hostile] verdicts from the press its next misfortune was to be burnt by a bishop – probably in his despair at not being able to burn me&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|Hardy painted by [[William Strang]], 1893]]==Literary themes==Considered a Victorian realist, Hardy examines the social constraints on the lives of those living in [[Victorian England]], and criticises those beliefs, especially those relating to marriage, education and religion, that limited people's lives and caused unhappiness</span>
				<span class='text'>Such unhappiness, and the suffering it brings, is seen by poet [[Philip Larkin]] as central in Hardy's works:::What is the intensely maturing experience of which Hardy's modern man is most sensible?  In my view it is suffering, or sadness, and extended consideration of the centrality of suffering in Hardy's work should be the first duty of the true critic for which the work is still waiting [</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> Any approach to his work, as to any writer's work, must seek first of all to determine what element is peculiarly his, which imaginative note he strikes most [[plangently]], and to deny that in this case it is the sometimes gentle, sometimes ironic, sometimes bitter but always passive apprehension of suffering is, I think, wrong-headed</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In ''Two on a Tower'', for example, Hardy takes a stand against these rules of society with a story of love that crosses the boundaries of class</span>
				<span class='text'>The reader is forced to reconsider the conventions set up by society for the relationships between women and men</span>
				<span class='text'>Nineteenth-century society had conventions, which were enforced</span>
				<span class='text'>In this novel Swithin St Cleeve's idealism pits him against such contemporary social constraints</span>
				<span class='text'>:In a novel structured around contrasts, the main opposition is between Swithin St Cleeve and Lady Viviette Constantine, who are presented as binary figures in a series of ways: aristocratic and lower class, youthful and mature, single and married, fair and dark, religious and agnostic</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>he [Lady Viviette Constantine] is also deeply conventional, absurdly wishing to conceal their marriage until Swithin has achieved social status through his scientific work, which gives rise to uncontrolled ironies and tragic-comic misunderstandings</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Fate or chance is another important theme</span>
				<span class='text'>Hardy's characters often encounter crossroads on a journey, a junction that offers alternative physical destinations but which is also symbolic of a point of opportunity and transition, further suggesting that fate is at work</span>
				<span class='text'>''Far From the Madding Crowd'' is an example of  a novel in which chance has a major role: &quot;Had Bathsheba not sent the valentine, had Fanny not missed her wedding, for example, the story would have taken an entirely different path</span>

				<span class='text'>ome of Hardy's most famous poems are from &quot;Poems of 1912–13&quot;, part of ''Satires of Circumstance'' (1914), written following the death of his wife Emma in 1912</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Many of Hardy's poems deal with themes of disappointment in love and life, and &quot;the perversity of fate&quot;, but the best of them present these themes with &quot;a carefully controlled elegiac feeling&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>He was baptised at the age of five weeks and attended church, where his father and uncle contributed to music</span>
				<span class='text'>However, he did not attend the local [[Church of England]] school, instead being sent to Mr Last's school, three miles away</span>

				<span class='text'>Hardy flirted with conversion, but decided against it</span>

				<span class='text'>6–47</span>

				<span class='text'>he replacement of the old concept of God as all-powerful by a new concept of universal consciousness</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Hardy's religious life seems to have mixed agnosticism, [[deism]], and [[spiritism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Once, when asked in correspondence by a clergyman about the question of reconciling the horrors of pain with the goodness of a loving God, Hardy replied,::Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Hardy regrets that he is unable to offer any hypothesis which would reconcile the existence of such evils as [[Alexander Grosart|Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Grosart]] describes with the idea of omnipotent goodness</span>
				<span class='text'>Perhaps Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Grosart might be helped to a provisional view of the universe by the recently published ''Life of Darwin'' and the works of [[Herbert Spencer]] and other agnostics</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=norton/&gt;Hardy frequently conceived of, and wrote about, supernatural forces, particularly those that control the universe through indifference or caprice rather than any firm will</span>
				<span class='text'>He also showed in his writing some degree of fascination with ghosts and spirits</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Even so, he retained a strong emotional attachment to the Christian liturgy and church rituals, particularly as manifested in rural communities, that had been such a formative influence in his early years, and Biblical references can be found woven throughout many of Hardy's novels</span>
				<span class='text'>ardy's friends during his apprenticeship to John Hicks included [[Horatio Mosley Moule|Horace Moule]] (one of the eight sons of [[Henry Moule]]), and the poet [[William Barnes]], both ministers of religion</span>
				<span class='text'>Moule remained a close friend of Hardy's for the rest of his life, and introduced him to new scientific findings that cast doubt on literal interpretations of the Bible,&lt;ref&gt;[http://wps</span>

				<span class='text'>Moule gave Hardy a copy of Mantell's book ''The Wonders of Geology'' (1848) in 1858, and Adelene Buckland has suggested that there are &quot;compelling similarities&quot; between the &quot;cliffhanger&quot; section from ''A Pair of Blue Eyes'' and Mantell's geological descriptions</span>
