				<span class='text'>gg}} (September 17, 1826 – July 20, 1866) was an influential [[Germany|German]] [[mathematics|mathematician]] who made lasting and revolutionary contributions to [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], [[number theory]], and [[differential geometry]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n the field of real analysis, he is mostly known for the first rigorous formulation of the integral, the [[Riemann integral]], and his work on [[Fourier series]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His contributions to [[complex analysis]] include most notably the introduction of [[Riemann surfaces]], breaking new ground in a natural, geometric treatment of complex analysis</span>
				<span class='text'>is famous [[On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude|1859 paper]] on the [[prime-counting function]], containing the original statement of the [[Riemann hypothesis]], is regarded, although it is his only paper in the field, as one of the most influential papers in [[analytic number theory]]</span>
				<span class='text'>hrough his pioneering [[Riemannian Geometry|contributions to differential geometry]], Riemann laid the foundations of the mathematics of [[general relativity]]</span>
				<span class='text'> == Biography =====Early years===Riemann was born in [[Breselenz]], a village near [[Dannenberg (Elbe)|Dannenberg]] in the [[Kingdom of Hanover]] in what is  the [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] today</span>
				<span class='text'>His father, Friedrich Bernhard Riemann, was a poor [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] pastor in Breselenz who fought in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His mother, Charlotte Ebell, died before her children had reached adulthood</span>
				<span class='text'>Riemann was the second of six children, shy and suffering from numerous nervous breakdowns</span>
				<span class='text'>Riemann exhibited exceptional mathematical skills, such as calculation abilities, from an early age but suffered from timidity and a fear of speaking in public</span>
				<span class='text'>==Education===During 1840, Riemann went to [[Hanover]] to live with his grandmother and attend [[lyceum]] (middle school)</span>
				<span class='text'>After the death of his grandmother in 1842, he attended high school at the [[:de:Johanneum Lüneburg|Johanneum Lüneburg]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In high school, Riemann studied the [[Bible]] intensively, but he was often distracted by mathematics</span>
				<span class='text'>His teachers were amazed by his adept ability to perform complicated mathematical operations, in which he often outstripped his instructor's knowledge</span>
				<span class='text'> In 1846, at the age of 19, he started studying [[philology]] and [[theology]] in order to become a pastor and help with his family's finances</span>
				<span class='text'>uring the spring of 1846, his father, after gathering enough money, sent Riemann to the renowned [[University of Göttingen]], where he planned to study towards a degree in Theology</span>
				<span class='text'>However, once there, he began studying [[mathematics]] under [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] (specifically his lectures on the [[method of least squares]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Gauss recommended that Riemann give up his theological work and enter the mathematical field (but he remained a devout Christian throughout his life); after getting his father's approval, Riemann transferred to the [[University of Berlin]] in 1847</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hawking|first=Stephen|title=God Created the Integers|year=2005|publisher=Running Press|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-7624-1922-7|pages=814–815}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time of study, [[Carl Gustav Jakob Jacobi|Jacobi]], [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet|Lejeune Dirichlet]], [[Jakob Steiner|Steiner]], and [[Ferdinand Gotthold Max Eisenstein|Eisenstein]] were teaching</span>
				<span class='text'>He stayed in Berlin for two years and returned to Göttingen in 1849</span>
				<span class='text'>==Academia===Riemann held his first lectures in 1854, which founded the field of [[Riemannian geometry]] and thereby set the stage for [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[general theory of relativity]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1857, there was an attempt to promote Riemann to extraordinary professor status at the [[University of Göttingen]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Although this attempt failed, it did result in Riemann finally being granted a regular salary</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1859, following [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet|Lejeune Dirichlet]]'s death, he was promoted to head the mathematics department at Göttingen</span>
				<span class='text'>He was also the first to suggest using [[higher dimensions|dimensions higher than merely three or four]]  in order to describe physical reality&lt;ref&gt;Werke, p</span>

				<span class='text'>Riemann was a dedicated Christian, the son of a Protestant minister, and saw his life as a mathematician as another way to serve God</span>
				<span class='text'>During his life, he held closely to his Christian faith and considered it to be the most important aspect of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>At the time of his death, he was reciting the Lord’s Prayer with his wife and died before they finished saying the prayer</span>

				<span class='text'>tml| title=Riemann’s Tomb |accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;==  Riemannian geometry =={{General geometry |geometers by name}}Riemann's published works opened up research areas combining analysis with geometry</span>
				<span class='text'>These would subsequently become major parts of the theories of [[Riemannian geometry]], [[algebraic geometry]], and [[complex manifold]] theory</span>
				<span class='text'>The theory of [[Riemann surface]]s was elaborated by [[Felix Klein]] and particularly [[Adolf Hurwitz]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This area of mathematics is part of the foundation of [[topology]] and is still being applied in novel ways to [[mathematical physics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1853, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] asked his student Riemann to prepare a ''[[Habilitationsschrift]]'' on the foundations of geometry</span>
				<span class='text'>Over many months, Riemann developed his theory of [[higher dimensions]] and delivered his lecture at Göttingen in 1854 entitled ''Über die Hypothesen welche der Geometrie zu Grunde liegen'' (&quot;[http://www</span>
				<span class='text'>mis</span>
				<span class='text'>e/classics/Riemann/WKCGeom</span>
				<span class='text'>df On the hypotheses which underlie geometry]&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>It was only published twelve years later in 1868 by Dedekind, two years after his death</span>
				<span class='text'>Its early reception appears to have been slow but it is now recognized as one of the most important works in geometry</span>
				<span class='text'>he subject founded by this work is [[Riemannian geometry]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Riemann found the correct way to extend into ''n'' dimensions the [[differential geometry]] of surfaces, which Gauss himself proved in his ''[[theorema egregium]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The fundamental object is called the [[Riemann curvature tensor]]</span>
				<span class='text'>For the surface case, this can be reduced to a number (scalar), positive, negative or zero; the non-zero and constant cases being models of the known [[non-Euclidean geometries]]</span>
				<span class='text'>iemann's idea was to introduce a collection of numbers at every point in space (i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> a [[tensor]]) which would describe how much it was bent or curved</span>
				<span class='text'>Riemann found that in four spatial dimensions, one needs a collection of ten numbers at each point to describe the properties of a [[manifold]], no matter how distorted it is</span>
				<span class='text'>This is the famous construction central to his geometry, known now as a [[Riemannian metric]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Complex analysis==In his dissertation, he established a geometric foundation for [[complex analysis]] through [[Riemann surface]]s, through which multi-valued functions like the [[logarithm]] (with infinitely many sheets) or the [[square root]] (with two sheets) could become [[one-to-one function]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>Complex functions are [[harmonic functions]] (that is, they satisfy [[Laplace's equation]] and thus the [[Cauchy-Riemann equations]]) on these surfaces and are described by the location of their singularities and the topology of the surfaces</span>
				<span class='text'>The topological &quot;genus&quot; of the Riemann surfaces is given by &lt;math&gt;g=w/2-n+1&lt;/math&gt;, where the surface has &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; leaves coming together at &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; branch points</span>
				<span class='text'>For &lt;math&gt;g&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; the Riemann surface has &lt;math&gt;(3g-3)&lt;/math&gt; parameters (the &quot;moduli&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>is contributions to this area are numerous</span>
				<span class='text'>The famous [[Riemann mapping theorem]] says that a simply connected domain in the complex plane is &quot;biholomorphically equivalent&quot; (i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>there is a bijection between them that is holomorphic with a holomorphic inverse) to either &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; or to the interior of the unit circle</span>
				<span class='text'>The generalization of the theorem to Riemann surfaces is the famous [[uniformization theorem]], which was proved in the 19th century by [[Henri Poincaré]] and [[Felix Klein]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Here, too, rigorous proofs were first given after the development of richer mathematical tools (in this case, topology)</span>
				<span class='text'>For the proof of the existence of functions on Riemann surfaces he used a minimality condition, which he called the [[Dirichlet principle]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Weierstrass]] found a hole in the proof: Riemann had not noticed that his working assumption (that the minimum existed) might not work; the function space might not be complete, and therefore the existence of a minimum was not guaranteed</span>
				<span class='text'>Through the work of [[David Hilbert]]  in the Calculus of Variations, the Dirichlet principle was finally established</span>
				<span class='text'>Otherwise, [[Weierstrass]] was very impressed with Riemann, especially with his theory of [[abelian function]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>When Riemann's work appeared, Weierstrass withdrew his paper from [[Crelle]] and did not publish it</span>
				<span class='text'>They had a good understanding when Riemann visited him in Berlin in 1859</span>
				<span class='text'>Weierstrass encouraged his student [[Hermann Amandus Schwarz]] to find alternatives to the Dirichlet principle in complex analysis, in which he was successful</span>
				<span class='text'>An anecdote from [[Arnold Sommerfeld]]&lt;ref&gt;Sommerfeld „Vorlesungen über theoretische Physik“, Bd</span>
				<span class='text'> (Mechanik deformierbarer Medien), Harri Deutsch, S</span>
				<span class='text'>24</span>
				<span class='text'>Sommerfeld heard the story from Aachener Professor of Experimental Physics Adolf Wüllner</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; shows the difficulties which contemporary mathematicians had with Riemann's new ideas</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1870, Weierstrass had taken Riemann's dissertation with him on a holiday to Rigi and complained that it was hard to understand</span>
				<span class='text'>The physicist Hermann von Helmholtz assisted him in the work over night and returned with the comment that it was &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;very understandable&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>ther highlights include his work on abelian functions and [[theta functions]] on Riemann surfaces</span>
				<span class='text'>Riemann had been in a competition with Weierstrass since 1857 to solve the Jacobian inverse problems for abelian integrals, a generalization of [[elliptic integrals]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Riemann used theta functions in several variables and reduced the problem to the determination of the zeros of these theta functions</span>
				<span class='text'>Riemann also investigated period matrices and characterized them through the &quot;Riemannian period relations&quot; (symmetric, real part negative)</span>
				<span class='text'>By [[Frobenius]] and [[Lefschetz]] the validity of this relation is equivalent with the embedding of &lt;math&gt;C^n/\Omega&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is the lattice of the period matrix) in a projective space by means of theta functions</span>
				<span class='text'>For certain values of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, this is the [[Jacobian variety]] of the Riemann surface, an example of an abelian manifold</span>
				<span class='text'>any mathematicians such as [[Alfred Clebsch]] furthered Riemann's work on algebraic curves</span>
				<span class='text'>These theories depended on the properties of a function defined on Riemann surfaces</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, the [[Riemann-Roch theorem]] (Roch was a student of Riemann) says something about the number of linearly independent differentials (with known conditions on the zeros and poles) of a Riemann surface</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to [[Laugwitz]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Detlef Laugwitz]]: ''Bernhard Riemann 1826-1866''</span>
				<span class='text'>Birkhäuser, Basel 1996, ISBN 978-3-7643-5189-2&lt;/ref&gt; automorphic functions appeared for the first time in an essay about the Laplace equation on electrically charged cylinders</span>
				<span class='text'>Riemann however used such functions for conformal maps (such as mapping topological triangles to the circle) in his 1859 lecture on hypergeometric functions or in his treatise on minimal surfaces</span>
				<span class='text'>=Real analysis==In the field of [[real analysis]], he discovered the [[Riemann integral]] in his habilitation</span>
				<span class='text'>Among other things, he showed that every piecewise continuous function is integrable</span>
				<span class='text'>Similarly, the [[Stieltjes integral]] goes back to the Göttinger mathematician, and so they are named together the [[Riemann-Stieltjes integral]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n his habilitation work on [[Fourier series]], where he followed the work of his teacher Dirichlet, he showed that Riemann-integrable functions are &quot;representable&quot; by Fourier series</span>
				<span class='text'>Dirichlet has shown this for continuous, piecewise-differentiable functions (thus with countably many non-differentiable points)</span>
				<span class='text'>Riemann gave an example of a Fourier series representing a continuous, almost nowhere-differentiable function, a case not covered by Dirichlet</span>
				<span class='text'> He also proved the [[Riemann-Lebesgue lemma]]: if a function is representable by a Fourier series, then the Fourier coefficients go to zero for large ''n''</span>
				<span class='text'>iemann's essay was also the starting point for [[Georg Cantor]]'s work with Fourier series, which was the impetus for [[set theory]]</span>
				<span class='text'>e also worked with [[hypergeometric differential equations]] in 1857 using complex analytical methods and presented the solutions through the behavior of closed paths about singularities (described by the [[monodromy matrix]])</span>
				<span class='text'>The proof of the existence of such differential equations by previously known monodromy matrices is one of the Hilbert problems</span>
				<span class='text'>= Number theory==He made some famous contributions to modern [[analytic number theory]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In [[On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude|a single short paper]], the only one he published on the subject of number theory, he investigated the [[Riemann zeta function|zeta function]] that now bears his name, establishing its importance for understanding the distribution of [[prime number]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Riemann hypothesis]] was one of a series of conjectures he made about the function's properties</span>
				<span class='text'>n Riemann's work there are many more interesting developments</span>
				<span class='text'>He proved the functional equation for the zeta function (already known to Euler), behind which a theta function lies</span>
				<span class='text'>Also, it gives a better approximation for the prime-counting function &lt;math&gt;\pi(x)&lt;/math&gt; than Gauss's function &lt;math&gt;Li(x)&lt;/math&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'>Through the summation of this approximation function over the non-trivial zeros on the line with real portion 1/2, he gave an exact, &quot;explicit formula&quot; for &lt;math&gt;\pi(x)&lt;/math&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'>iemann knew Chebyshev's work on the Prime Number Theorem</span>
				<span class='text'>He had visited Dirichlet in 1852</span>
				<span class='text'>But Riemann's methods were very different</span>
