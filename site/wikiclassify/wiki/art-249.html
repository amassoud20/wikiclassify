				<span class='text'>1792 BC</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babylon was one of the many largely Amorite ruled city-states that dotted the central and southern Mesopotamian plains and waged war on each other for control of fertile [[agriculture|agricultural]] land</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop |2005|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though many cultures co-existed in Mesopotamia, Babylonian culture gained a degree of prominence among the [[literacy|literate]] classes throughout the [[Middle East]] under Hammurabi</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;VM3&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The kings who came before Hammurabi had founded a relatively minor City State in 1894 BC which controlled little territory outside of the city itself</span>
				<span class='text'>Babylon was overshadowed by older, larger and more powerful kingdoms such as [[Elam]], [[Assyria]], [[Isin]], [[Eshnunna]] and [[Larsa]] for a century or so after its founding</span>
				<span class='text'>However his father [[Sin-Muballit]] had begun to consolidate rule of a small area of south central Mesopotamia under Babylonian [[hegemony]] and, by the time of his reign, had conquered the minor city-states of [[Borsippa]], [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]], and [[Sippar]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;VM3&quot; /&gt;Thus Hammurabi ascended to the throne as the king of a minor kingdom in the midst of a complex [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] situation</span>
				<span class='text'>The powerful kingdom of [[Eshnunna]] controlled the upper Tigris River while [[Larsa]] controlled the river delta</span>
				<span class='text'> To the east of Mesopotamia lay the powerful kingdom of [[Elam]] which regularly invaded and forced tribute upon the small states of southern Mesopotamia</span>
				<span class='text'> In northern Mesopotamia, the [[Assyria]]n king [[Shamshi-Adad I]], who had already inherited centuries old Assyrian colonies in [[Asia Minor]], had expanded his territory into the [[Levant]] and central [[Mesopotamia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|pp=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; although his untimely death would somewhat fragment his empire</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;The first few decades of Hammurabi's reign were quite peaceful</span>
				<span class='text'> Hammurabi used his power to undertake a series of public works, including heightening the city walls for defensive purposes, and expanding the temples</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|2005|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; In c</span>
				<span class='text'>1801 BC, the powerful kingdom of [[Elam]], which straddled important [[trade]] routes across the [[Zagros Mountains]], invaded the Mesopotamian plain</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|pp=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; With allies among the plain states, Elam attacked and destroyed the kingdom of [[Eshnunna]], destroying a number of cities and imposing its rule on portions of the plain for the first time</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to consolidate its position, Elam tried to start a war between Hammurabi's Babylonian kingdom and the kingdom of [[Larsa]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;VM18&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hammurabi and the king of [[Larsa]] made an alliance when they discovered this duplicity and were able to crush the Elamites, although Larsa did not contribute greatly to the military effort</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;VM18&quot; /&gt; Angered by Larsa's failure to come to his aid, Hammurabi turned on that southern power, thus gaining control of the entirety of the lower Mesopotamian plain by c</span>
				<span class='text'>1763 BC</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;VM31&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;As Hammurabi was assisted during the war in the south by his allies from the north such as [[Yamhad]] and [[Mari, Syria|Mari]], the absence of soldiers in the north led to unrest</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;VM31&quot; /&gt; Continuing his expansion, Hammurabi turned his attention northward, quelling the unrest and soon after crushing Eshnunna</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|pp=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Next the Babylonian armies conquered the remaining northern states, including Babylon's former ally Mari, although it is possible that the 'conquest' of Mari was a surrender without any actual conflict</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|pp=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|pp= 64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ar45&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|2005|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;Hammurabi entered into a protracted war with [[Ishme-Dagan I]] of [[Assyria]] for control of Mesopotamia, with both kings making alliances with minor states in order to gain the upper hand</span>
				<span class='text'>Eventually Hammurabi prevailed, ousting Ishme-Dagan I just before his own death</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Mut-Ashkur]] the new king of Assyria was forced to pay tribute to Hammurabi, however Babylon did not rule Assyria directly</span>
				<span class='text'>n just a few years, Hammurabi had succeeded in uniting all of Mesopotamia under his rule</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ar45&quot; /&gt; The Assyrian kingdom survived but was forced to pay tribute during his reign, and of the major city-states in the region, only [[Yamhad|Aleppo]] and [[Qatna]] to the west in the [[Levant]] maintained their independence</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ar45&quot; /&gt; However, one stele of Hammurabi has been found as far north as [[Diyarbekir]], where he claims the title &quot;King of the Amorites&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}Under the rule of Hammurabi's successor [[Samsu-iluna]], the short-lived Babylonian Empire began to collapse</span>
				<span class='text'>In northern Mesopotamia, both the Amorites and Babylonians were driven from [[Assyria]] by [[Puzur-Sin]] a native [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]-speaking ruler, circa 1740 BC</span>
				<span class='text'>Around the same time, native Akkadian speakers threw off Amorite Babylonian rule in the far south of Mesopotamia, creating the [[Sealand Dynasty]], in more or less the region of ancient Sumer</span>
				<span class='text'>Hammurabi's ineffectual successors met with further defeats and loss of territory at the hands of Assyrian kings such as [[Adasi]] and [[Bel-ibni]], as well as to the Sealand Dynasty to the south, [[Elam]] to the east, and to the [[Kassites]] from the northeast</span>
