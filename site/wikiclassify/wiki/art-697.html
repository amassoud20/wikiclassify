				<span class='text'>1460s – 23 December 1524) was a [[Portugal in the Age of Discovery|Portuguese explorer]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was the first European to reach India by sea, linking [[Europe]] and [[Asia]] for the first time  by ocean route, as well as the [[Atlantic]] and the [[Indian ocean|Indian]] oceans entirely and definitively, and in this way, the [[Western culture|West]] and the [[Eastern world|Orient]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This was accomplished on his first voyage to India (1497–1499)</span>
				<span class='text'>a Gama's [[Discovery of the sea route to India|discovery]] was significant and opened the way for an age of global [[imperialism]] and for the Portuguese to establish a long-lasting [[colonial empire]] in Asia</span>
				<span class='text'>The route meant that the Portuguese would not need to cross the highly disputed [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] nor the dangerous [[Arabian Peninsula]], and that the whole voyage would be made by sea</span>
				<span class='text'>he sum of the distances covered in the outward and return voyages made this expedition the longest ocean voyage ever made until then, far longer than a full voyage around the world by way of the [[Equator]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Winius, &quot;Foundations of the Portuguese Empire, 1415–1580&quot;, p</span>
				<span class='text'>76&lt;/ref&gt;One century after the discovery, European powers such as [[England]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[France]] were finally able to challenge and break Portugal's monopoly and naval supremacy in the Cape Route around [[Africa]], the Indian Ocean and in the Far East, opening a new era of European imperialism in the East</span>
				<span class='text'>fter decades of sailors trying to reach the Indies with thousands of lives and dozens of vessels lost in shipwrecks and attacks, da Gama landed in [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] on 20 May 1498</span>
				<span class='text'>Reaching the legendary Indian [[spice trade|spice routes]] unopposed helped the [[Portuguese Empire]] improve its economy that, until da Gama's discovery, was based mainly on trading along northern and coastal West Africa</span>
				<span class='text'>The spices obtained were mostly [[Black pepper|pepper]] and [[cinnamon]] at first, but soon included other products, all new to Europe and leading to a commercial monopoly for several decades</span>
				<span class='text'>a Gama led two of the [[Portuguese India Armadas|armadas destined for India]], the first and the fourth, which was the largest and made only four years after his return from the first one</span>
				<span class='text'>For his contributions he was appointed the [[List of governors of Portuguese India|Governor of India]] in 1524, under the title of [[Viceroy]], and given the newly created [[Count of Vidigueira|County of Vidigueira]] in 1519</span>
				<span class='text'>Vasco da Gama remains a leading figure in the history of exploration to this day</span>
				<span class='text'>Numerous homages have been made worldwide to celebrate his explorations and accomplishments</span>
				<span class='text'> The Portuguese national epic, ''[[Os Lusíadas]]'', was written in his honour</span>
				<span class='text'>His first trip to India is widely considered a milestone in world history as it marked the beginning of the first wave of global multiculturalism</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and went on to rise in the ranks of the  military [[Order of Saint James of the Sword|Order of Santiago]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Estêvão da Gama was appointed ''alcaide-mór'' (civil governor) of Sines in the 1460s, a post he held until 1478, and continued as a receiver of taxes and holder of the Order's commendas in the region</span>
				<span class='text'>stêvão da Gama married Isabel Sodré, a daughter of João Sodré (also known as João de Resende), scion of a well-connected family of English origin</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;The Sodrés were said to have been descended from Frederick Sudley, of Gloucestershire, who accompanied the [[Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York|Earl of Cambridge]] to Portugal in 1381, and subsequently settled down there (Subrahmanyam, 1997, p</span>
				<span class='text'>61)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Her father and her brothers, [[Vicente Sodré]] and Brás Sodré, had links to the household of [[Infante Diogo, Duke of Viseu]] and were prominent figures in the military [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]]</span>
				<span class='text'>asco da Gama was the third of five sons of Estêvão da Gama and Isabel Sodré – in (probable) order of age: [[Paulo da Gama]], João Sodré, Vasco da Gama, Pedro da Gama and Aires da Gama</span>
				<span class='text'>Vasco also had one known sister, Teresa da Gama (who married Lopo Mendes de Vasconcelos)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Subrahmanyam, 1997, p</span>
				<span class='text'>61</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Little is known of da Gama's early life</span>
				<span class='text'>The Portuguese historian [[Augusto Carlos Teixeira de Aragão|Teixeira de Aragão]] suggests that he studied at the inland town of [[Évora]], which is where he may have learned mathematics and navigation</span>
				<span class='text'>It has even been claimed (although dubiously) that he studied under the astrologer and astronomer, [[Abraham Zacuto]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Subrahmanyam, 1997, p</span>
				<span class='text'>62</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Around 1480, da Gama followed his father (rather than the Sodrés) and joined the [[Order of Saint James of the Sword|Order of Santiago]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Subrahmanyam, 1997, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>60-61</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The master of Santiago was Prince John, who would ascend to the throne in 1481 as King [[John II of Portugal]]</span>
				<span class='text'> John II doted on the Order, and the da Gamas' prospects rose accordingly</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1492, John II dispatched da Gama on a mission to the port of [[Setúbal]] and to the [[Algarve]] to seize [[Kingdom of France|French]] ships in retaliation for peacetime depredations against Portuguese shipping – a task that da Gama rapidly and effectively performed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Subrahmanyam, 1997, p</span>
				<span class='text'>63</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;== Exploration before da Gama =={{unreferenced section|date=February 2012}}From the earlier part of the 15th century, [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese expeditions]] organized by Prince [[Henry the Navigator]] had been crawling down the African coastline, principally in search of west African riches (notably, gold)</span>
				<span class='text'> They had greatly extended Portuguese maritime knowledge, but had little profit to show for the effort</span>
				<span class='text'> After Henry's death in 1460, the Portuguese crown showed little interest in continuing and, in 1469, sold off the neglected African enterprise to a private Lisbon merchant consortium led by [[Fernão Gomes]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Within a few years, Gomes's captains expanded Portuguese knowledge across the [[Gulf of Guinea]],  doing business in gold dust, [[Melegueta pepper]], ivory and slaves</span>
				<span class='text'> When Gomes's charter came up for renewal in 1474, Prince John (future John II), asked his father [[Afonso V of Portugal]] to pass the African charter to him</span>
				<span class='text'>pon becoming king in 1481, [[John II of Portugal]] set out on many long reforms</span>
				<span class='text'>To break the monarch's dependence on the feudal nobility, John II needed to build up the royal treasury, and saw royal commerce as the key to it</span>
				<span class='text'>Under John II's watch, the gold and slave trade in west Africa was greatly expanded</span>
				<span class='text'>He was eager to break into the highly profitable [[spice trade]] between Europe and Asia</span>
				<span class='text'>At the time, this was virtually monopolized by the [[Republic of Venice]], who operated overland routes via Levantine and Egyptian ports, through the Red Sea across to the spice markets of India</span>
				<span class='text'>John II set a new objective for his captains: to find a sea route to Asia by sailing around the African continent</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Vasco da Gama Leaving Portugal,</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|300px|Vasco da Gama leaving the port of [[Lisbon]], Portugal</span>
				<span class='text'>]By the time Vasco da Gama was in his 20s, these plans were coming to fruition</span>
				<span class='text'> In 1487, John II dispatched two spies, [[Pero da Covilhã]] and [[Afonso de Paiva]], overland via Egypt, to East Africa and India, to scout the details of the spice markets and trade routes</span>
				<span class='text'>The breakthrough came soon after when John II's captain [[Bartolomeu Dias]] returned from rounding the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1488, having explored as far as the [[Fish River, Eastern Cape|Fish River]] (''Rio do Infante'') in modern-day South Africa and having verified that the unknown coast stretched away to the northeast</span>
				<span class='text'>t remained for an explorer to prove the link between the findings of Dias and those of da Covilhã and de Paiva and to connect these separate segments into a potentially lucrative trade route into the Indian Ocean</span>
				<span class='text'>= First voyage ==On 8 July 1497 Vasco da Gama led a fleet of four ships with a crew of 170 men from [[Lisbon]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The distance traveled in the journey around Africa to India and back was greater than around the equator</span>

				<span class='text'>This turned out to be a rather complicated affair, for Sines still belonged to the [[Order of Saint James of the Sword|Order of Santiago]]</span>
				<span class='text'>On the face of it, it should not have been a problem for [[Jorge de Lencastre]], the master of the Order, to endorse the reward – after all, da Gama was a Santiago knight, one of their own, and a close associate of Lencastre himself</span>
				<span class='text'>But the fact that Sines was awarded by the king's hand, provoked Lencastre to refuse out of principle – lest it encourage the king to make other donations of the Order's properties</span>

				<span class='text'>Da Gama left behind a small squadron of [[caravel]]s, under the command of his uncle, [[Vicente Sodré]], to patrol the Indian coast, to continue harassing Calicut shipping, and to protect the Portuguese factories at Cochin and Cannanore from the Zamorin's inevitable reprisals</span>
				<span class='text'>asco da Gama arrived back in Portugal in September 1503, effectively having failed in his mission to bring the Zamorin to submission</span>
				<span class='text'> This failure, and the subsequent more galling failure of his uncle Vicente Sodré to protect the Portuguese factory in Cochin, probably counted against any further rewards</span>

				<span class='text'>Seeing the new Spanish threat to the [[Maluku Islands]] as the priority, Vasco da Gama advised against the obsession with Arabia that had pervaded much of the Manueline period, and continued to be the dominant concern of [[Duarte de Menezes]], then-[[List of governors of Portuguese India|governor of Portuguese India]]</span>

				<span class='text'> As a result, John III decided to appoint Vasco da Gama himself to replace Menezes, confident that the magic of the his name and memory of his deeds might better impress his authority on Portuguese India, and manage the transition to a new government and new strategy</span>
				<span class='text'>y his appointment letter of February 1524, John III granted Vasco da Gama the privileged title of &quot;[[Viceroy#Portuguese Empire|Viceroy]]&quot;, being only the second Portuguese governor to enjoy that title (the first was [[Francisco de Almeida]] in 1505)</span>
