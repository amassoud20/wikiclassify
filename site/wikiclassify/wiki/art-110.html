				<span class='text'>In his twenties Caravaggio moved to Rome where there was a demand for paintings to fill the many huge new churches and [[palazzo]]s being built at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>It was also a period when the Church was searching for a stylistic alternative to [[Mannerism]] in religious art that was tasked to [[Counter-Reformation|counter the threat of Protestantism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Harris, Ann Sutherland, Seventeenth-century Art &amp; Architecture (Upper Saddle River: Pearson/Prentice Hall, 2008)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Caravaggio's innovation was a radical [[Naturalism (art)|naturalism]] that combined close physical observation with a dramatic, even theatrical, use of [[chiaroscuro]] which came to be known as [[tenebrism]] (the shift from light to dark with little intermediate value)</span>
				<span class='text'>e burst upon the Rome art scene in 1600 with the success of his first public commissions, the ''[[The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew (Caravaggio)|Martyrdom of Saint Matthew]]'' and ''[[The Calling of St Matthew (Caravaggio)|Calling of Saint Matthew]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Thereafter he never lacked commissions or patrons, yet he handled his success poorly</span>
				<span class='text'>He was jailed on several occasions, vandalized his own apartment, and ultimately had a death sentence pronounced against him by the Pope after killing a young man, possibly unintentionally, on May 29, 1606</span>

				<span class='text'>3</span>
				<span class='text'>The quotation originates in [[Karel van Mander]]'s ''Het Schilder-Boek'' of 1604, translated in full in Howard Hibbard, &quot;Caravaggio&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The first reference to Caravaggio in a contemporary document from Rome is the listing of his name, with that of Prospero Orsi as his partner, as an 'assistente' in a procession in October 1594 in honour of St</span>
				<span class='text'>Luke (see H</span>
				<span class='text'>Waga &quot;Vita nota e ignota dei virtuosi al Pantheon&quot; Rome 1992, Appendix I, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>19 and 220ff)</span>
				<span class='text'>The earliest informative account of his life in the city  is a court transcript dated 11 July 1597, when Caravaggio and Prospero Orsi were witnesses to a crime near San Luigi de' Francesi</span>
				<span class='text'>(See &quot;The earliest account of Caravaggio in Rome&quot; Sandro Corradini and Maurizio Marini, [[The Burlington Magazine]], pp</span>
				<span class='text'>5–28)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In 1606 he killed a young man in a brawl and fled from Rome with a price on his head</span>
				<span class='text'>He was involved in a brawl in Malta in 1608, and another in Naples in 1609, possibly a deliberate attempt on his life by unidentified enemies</span>
				<span class='text'>This encounter left him severely injured</span>
				<span class='text'>A year later, at the age of 38, he died under mysterious circumstances in [[Porto Ercole]] in Tuscany, reportedly from a fever while on his way to Rome to receive a pardon</span>
				<span class='text'>amous while he lived, Caravaggio was forgotten almost immediately after his death, and it was only in the 20th century that his importance to the development of Western art was rediscovered</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite this, his influence on the new Baroque style that eventually emerged from the ruins of Mannerism was profound</span>
				<span class='text'>It can be seen directly or indirectly in the work of [[Rubens]], [[Jusepe de Ribera]], [[Bernini]], and [[Rembrandt]], and artists in the following generation heavily under his influence were called the &quot;Caravaggisti&quot; or &quot;Caravagesques&quot;, as well as tenebrists or ''tenebrosi'' (&quot;shadowists&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>The 20th-century art historian André Berne-Joffroy claimed: &quot;What begins in the work of Caravaggio is, quite simply, modern painting</span>

				<span class='text'>Caravaggio appears to have stayed in the Milan-Caravaggio area after his apprenticeship ended, but it is possible that he visited [[Venice]] and saw the works of [[Giorgione]], whom [[Federico Zuccari]] later accused him of imitating, and [[Titian]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He would also have become familiar with the art treasures of Milan, including [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|Last Supper]]'', and with the regional Lombard art, a style which valued simplicity and attention to [[Naturalism (visual art)|naturalistic]] detail and was closer to the naturalism of Germany than to the stylised formality and grandeur of Roman [[Mannerism]]</span>

				<span class='text'>]Caravaggio left Milan for Rome in 1592, in flight after &quot;certain quarrels&quot; and the wounding of a police officer</span>
				<span class='text'>He arrived in Rome &quot;naked and extremely needy </span>

				<span class='text'>5, apparently based on the three primary sources, Mancini, Baglione and Bellori, all of whom depict Caravaggio's early Roman years as a period of extreme poverty (see references below)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; A few months later he was performing hack-work for the highly successful [[Giuseppe Cesari]], [[Pope Clement VIII]]'s favourite artist, &quot;painting flowers and fruit&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Pietro Bellori, ''Le Vite de' pittori, scultori, et architetti moderni'', 1672: &quot;Michele was forced by necessity to enter the services of Cavalier Giuseppe d'Arpino, by whom he was employed to paint flowers and fruits so realistically that they began to attain the higher beauty that we love so much today</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt; in his factory-like workshop</span>
				<span class='text'>Known works from this period include a small ''[[Boy Peeling Fruit (Caravaggio)|Boy Peeling a Fruit]]'' (his earliest known painting), a ''[[Boy with a Basket of Fruit]]'', and the ''[[Young Sick Bacchus]]'', supposedly a self-portrait done during convalescence from a serious illness that ended his employment with Cesari</span>

				<span class='text'>]Caravaggio left Cesari, determined to make his own way</span>
				<span class='text'>At this point he forged some extremely important friendships, with the painter [[Prospero Orsi]], the architect [[Onorio Longhi]], and the sixteen-year-old [[Sicily|Sicilian]] artist [[Mario Minniti]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Orsi, established in the profession, introduced him to influential collectors; Longhi, more balefully, introduced him to the world of Roman street-brawls; and Minniti served as a model and, years later, would be instrumental in helping Caravaggio to important commissions in Sicily</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Catherine Puglisi, &quot;Caravaggio&quot;, p</span>
				<span class='text'>9</span>
				<span class='text'>Longhi was with Caravaggio on the night of the fatal brawl with Tomassoni; Robb, &quot;M&quot;, p</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;''[[The Fortune Teller (Caravaggio)|The Fortune Teller]]'', his first composition with more than one figure, shows Mario being cheated by a gypsy girl</span>
				<span class='text'>The theme was quite new for Rome, and proved immensely influential over the next century and beyond</span>
				<span class='text'>This, however, was in the future: at the time, Caravaggio sold it for practically nothing</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[Cardsharps|The Cardsharps]]'' — showing another naïve youth of privilege falling the victim of card cheats — is even more psychologically complex, and perhaps Caravaggio's first true masterpiece</span>
				<span class='text'>Like the ''[[The Fortune Teller (Caravaggio)|Fortune Teller]]'', it was immensely popular, and over 50 copies survive</span>
				<span class='text'>More importantly, it attracted the patronage of [[cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Francesco Maria del Monte]], one of the leading connoisseurs in Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>For Del Monte and his wealthy art-loving circle, Caravaggio executed a number of intimate chamber-pieces — ''[[The Musicians (Caravaggio)|The Musicians]]'', ''[[The Lute Player (Caravaggio)|The Lute Player]]'', a tipsy ''[[Bacchus (Caravaggio)|Bacchus]]'', an allegorical but realistic ''[[Boy Bitten by a Lizard (Caravaggio)|Boy Bitten by a Lizard]]'' — featuring Minniti and other adolescent models</span>

				<span class='text'>]The realism returned with Caravaggio's first paintings on religious themes, and the emergence of remarkable spirituality</span>
				<span class='text'>The first of these was the ''[[Penitent Magdalene (Caravaggio)|Penitent Magdalene]]'', showing [[Mary Magdalene]] at the moment when she has turned from her life as a courtesan and sits weeping on the floor, her jewels scattered around her</span>

				<span class='text'>9</span>
				<span class='text'>Robb is drawing on Bellori, who praises Caravaggio's &quot;true&quot; colours but finds the naturalism offensive: &quot;He (Caravaggio) was satisfied with [the] invention of nature without further exercising his brain</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt;It was understated, in the Lombard manner, not histrionic in the Roman manner of the time</span>
				<span class='text'>It was followed by others in the same style: ''[[Saint Catherine (Caravaggio)|Saint Catherine]]''; ''[[Martha and Mary Magdalene (Caravaggio)|Martha and Mary Magdalene]]''; ''[[Judith Beheading Holofernes (Caravaggio)|Judith Beheading Holofernes]]''; a ''[[Sacrifice of Isaac (Caravaggio)|Sacrifice of Isaac]]''; a ''[[Saint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy (Caravaggio)|Saint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy]]''; and a ''[[Rest on the Flight into Egypt (Caravaggio)|Rest on the Flight into Egypt]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The works, while viewed by a comparatively limited circle, increased Caravaggio's fame with both connoisseurs and his fellow artists</span>
				<span class='text'>But a true reputation would depend on public commissions, and for these it was necessary to look to the Church</span>
				<span class='text'>lready evident was the intense realism or naturalism for which Caravaggio is now famous</span>
				<span class='text'>He preferred to paint his subjects as the eye sees them, with all their natural flaws and defects instead of as idealised creations</span>
				<span class='text'>This allowed a full display of Caravaggio's virtuosic talents</span>
				<span class='text'>This shift from accepted standard practice and the classical idealism of [[Michelangelo]] was very controversial at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>Not only was his realism a noteworthy feature of his paintings during this period, he turned away from the lengthy preparations traditional in central Italy at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, he preferred the Venetian practice of working in oils directly from the subject – half-length figures and still life</span>
				<span class='text'>One of the characteristic paintings by Caravaggio at this time which gives a good demonstration of his virtuoso talent was his work ''[[Supper at Emmaus (Caravaggio), London|Supper at Emmaus]]'' from c</span>
				<span class='text'>600–1601</span>
				<span class='text'>==&quot;Most famous painter in Rome&quot; (1600–1606)===[[File:The Calling of Saint Matthew-Caravaggo (1599-1600)</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|''[[The Calling of St Matthew (Caravaggio)|The Calling of Saint Matthew]]'' (1599–1600)</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Contarelli Chapel]], [[San Luigi dei Francesi]], [[Rome]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The beam of light, which enters the picture from the direction of a real window, expresses in the blink of an eye the conversion of St Matthew, the hinge on which his destiny will turn, with no flying angels, parting clouds or other artifacts</span>
				<span class='text'>]In 1599, presumably through the influence of Del Monte, Caravaggio was contracted to decorate the [[Contarelli Chapel]] in the church of [[San Luigi dei Francesi]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The two works making up the commission, the ''[[The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew (Caravaggio)|Martyrdom of Saint Matthew]]'' and ''[[The Calling of St Matthew (Caravaggio)|Calling of Saint Matthew]]'', delivered in 1600, were an immediate sensation</span>
				<span class='text'>Caravaggio's [[tenebrism]] (a heightened [[chiaroscuro]]) brought high drama to his subjects, while his acutely observed realism brought a new level of emotional intensity</span>
				<span class='text'>Opinion among Caravaggio's artist peers was polarized</span>
				<span class='text'>Some denounced him for various perceived failings, notably his insistence on painting from life, without drawings, but for the most part he was hailed as a great artistic visionary: &quot;The painters then in Rome were greatly taken by this novelty, and the young ones particularly gathered around him, praised him as the unique imitator of nature, and looked on his work as miracles</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bellori</span>
				<span class='text'>The passage continues: &quot;[The younger painters] outdid each other in copying him, undressing their models and raising their lights; and rather than setting out to learn from study and instruction, each readily found in the streets or squares of Rome both masters and models for copying nature</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt;Caravaggio went on to secure a string of prestigious commissions for religious works featuring violent struggles, grotesque decapitations, torture and death, most notable and most technically masterful among them ''[[The Taking of Christ (Caravaggio)|The Taking of Christ]]'' of circa 1602 for the Mattei Family, recently rediscovered in Ireland after two centuries</span>
				<span class='text'>For the most part each new painting increased his fame, but a few were rejected by the various bodies for whom they were intended, at least in their original forms, and had to be re-painted or find new buyers</span>
				<span class='text'>The essence of the problem was that while Caravaggio's dramatic intensity was appreciated, his realism was seen by some as unacceptably vulgar</span>

				<span class='text'>For a more detailed discussion, see Gash, p</span>

				<span class='text'>79–188</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;His first version of ''[[Saint Matthew and the Angel (Caravaggio)|Saint Matthew and the Angel]]'', featured the saint as a bald peasant with dirty legs attended by a lightly clad over-familiar boy-angel, was rejected and a second version had to be painted as ''[[The Inspiration of Saint Matthew (Caravaggio)|The Inspiration of Saint Matthew]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Similarly, ''[[The Conversion of Saint Paul (Caravaggio)|The Conversion of Saint Paul]]'' was rejected, and while another version of the same subject, the ''[[Conversion on the Way to Damascus]]'', was accepted, it featured the saint's horse's haunches far more prominently than the saint himself, prompting this exchange between the artist and an exasperated official of [[Santa Maria del Popolo]]: &quot;Why have you put a horse in the middle, and [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]] on the ground?&quot; &quot;Because!&quot; &quot;Is the horse God?&quot; &quot;No, but he stands in God's light!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted without attribution in Lambert, p</span>

				<span class='text'>Anne (Dei Palafrenieri) (Caravaggio)|Grooms' Madonna]]'', also known as ''Madonna dei palafrenieri'', painted for a small altar in Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome, remained there for just two days, and was then taken off</span>
				<span class='text'>A cardinal's secretary wrote: &quot;In this painting there are but vulgarity, sacrilege, impiousness and disgust</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>ne would say it is a work made by a painter that can paint well, but of a dark spirit, and who has been for a lot of time far from God, from His adoration, and from any good thought</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;The ''[[Death of the Virgin (Caravaggio)|Death of the Virgin]]'', then, commissioned in 1601 by a wealthy jurist for his private chapel in the new Carmelite church of Santa Maria della Scala, was rejected by the Carmelites in 1606</span>
				<span class='text'>Caravaggio's contemporary [[Giulio Mancini]] records that it was rejected because Caravaggio had used a well-known prostitute as his model for the Virgin</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Mancini: &quot;Thus one can understand how badly some modern artists paint, such as those who, wishing to portray the Virgin Our Lady, depict some dirty prostitute from the Ortaccio, as Michelangelo da Caravaggio did in the Death of the Virgin in that painting for the Madonna della Scala, which for that very reason those good fathers rejected it, and perhaps that poor man suffered so much trouble in his lifetime</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt;[[Giovanni Baglione]], another contemporary, tells us it was due to Mary's bare legs&lt;ref&gt;Baglione: &quot;For the [church of] Madonna della Scala in Trastevere he painted the death of the Madonna, but because he had portrayed the Madonna with little decorum, swollen and with bare legs, it was taken away, and the Duke of Mantua bought it and placed it in his most noble gallery</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt; —a matter of decorum in either case</span>
				<span class='text'>Caravaggio scholar John Gash suggests that the problem for the Carmelites may have been theological rather than aesthetic, in that Caravaggio's version fails to assert the doctrine of the [[Assumption of Mary]], the idea that the Mother of God did not die in any ordinary sense but was assumed into Heaven</span>
				<span class='text'>The replacement altarpiece commissioned (from one of Caravaggio's most able followers, [[Carlo Saraceni]]), showed the Virgin not dead, as Caravaggio had painted her, but seated and dying; and even this was rejected, and replaced with a work which showed the Virgin not dying, but ascending into Heaven with choirs of angels</span>
				<span class='text'>In any case, the rejection did not mean that Caravaggio or his paintings were out of favour</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''Death of the Virgin'' was no sooner taken out of the church than it was purchased by the Duke of Mantua, on the advice of [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], and later acquired by [[Charles I of England]] before entering the French royal collection in 1671</span>

				<span class='text'>On 29 May 1606, he killed, possibly unintentionally, a young man named Ranuccio Tomassoni from [[Terni]] ([[Umbria]])</span>
				<span class='text'> The circumstances of the brawl and the death of Ranuccio Tomassoni remain mysterious</span>
				<span class='text'>Several contemporary ''avvisi'' referred to a quarrel over a gambling debt and a tennis game, and this explanation has become established in the popular imagination</span>

				<span class='text'>People as quarrelsome as he were often to be found in his company: and having in the end confronted Ranuccio Tomassoni a well-mannered young man over some disagreement about a tennis match they challenged one another to a duel</span>

				<span class='text'>Caravaggio, outlawed, fled to [[Naples]]</span>
				<span class='text'>There, outside the jurisdiction of the Roman authorities and protected by the Colonna family, the most famous painter in Rome became the most famous in Naples</span>
				<span class='text'>His connections with the [[Colonna family|Colonnas]] led to a stream of important church commissions, including the ''[[Madonna of the Rosary (Caravaggio)|Madonna of the Rosary]]'', and ''[[The Seven Works of Mercy (Caravaggio)|The Seven Works of Mercy]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;In 1606, following the death of Tomassoni, he fled first to the Colonna estates south of Rome, then on to Naples where Costanza Colonna Sforza, widow of Francesco Sforza, in whose husband's household Caravaggio's father had held a position, maintained a palace</span>
				<span class='text'>Costanza's brother Ascanio was Cardinal-Protector of the Kingdom of Naples, another brother, Marzio, was an advisor to the Spanish Viceroy, and a sister was married into the important Neapolitan Carafa family—connections which might help explain the cornucopia of major commissions which fell into Caravaggio's lap in that city</span>
				<span class='text'>Costanza's son Fabrizio Sforza Colonna, Knight of Malta and general of the Order's galleys, appears to have facilitated his arrival in the island in 1607 and his escape the next year, and he stayed in Costanza's Neapolitan palazzo on his return there in 1609</span>
				<span class='text'>These connections are treated in most biographies and studies—see, for example, Catherine Puglisi, &quot;Caravaggio&quot;, p</span>
				<span class='text'>58, for a brief outline</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Despite his success in Naples, after only a few months in the city Caravaggio left for [[Malta]], the headquarters of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of Malta]], presumably hoping that the patronage of [[Alof de Wignacourt]], Grand Master of the Knights, could help him secure a pardon for Tomassoni's death</span>
				<span class='text'>De Wignacourt proved so impressed at having the famous artist as official painter to the Order that he inducted him as a knight, and the early biographer Bellori records that the artist was well pleased with his success</span>
				<span class='text'> Major works from his Malta period include a huge ''[[The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist (Caravaggio)|Beheading of Saint John the Baptist]]'' (the only painting to which he put his signature) and a ''[[Portrait of Alof de Wignacourt and his Page]]'', as well as portraits of other leading knights</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet by late August 1608 he was arrested and imprisoned</span>
				<span class='text'> The circumstances surrounding this abrupt change of fortune have long been a matter of speculation, but recent investigation has revealed it to have been the result of yet another brawl, during which the door of a house was battered down and a knight seriously wounded</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;The discovery of the evidence for this brawl was reported by Dr Keith Sciberras of the University of Malta, in &quot;Frater Michael Angelus in tumultu: the cause of Caravaggio's imprisonment in Malta&quot;, ''The Burlington Magazine'', CXLV, April 2002, pp</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He was imprisoned by the knights and managed to escape</span>
				<span class='text'>By December he had been expelled from the Order &quot;as a foul and rotten member</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;This was the formal phrase used in all such cases</span>
				<span class='text'>The senior knights of the Order convened on 1 December 1608 and, after verifying that the accused had failed to appear although summoned four times, voted unanimously to expel their ''putridum et foetidum'' ex-brother</span>
				<span class='text'>Caravaggio was expelled, not for his crime, but for having left Malta without permission (i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> escaping)</span>

				<span class='text'>]Caravaggio made his way to [[Sicily]] where he met his old friend Mario Minniti, who was now married and living in [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Together they set off on what amounted to a triumphal tour from Syracuse to [[Messina]] and, maybe, on to the island capital, [[Palermo]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In Syracuse and Messina Caravaggio continued to win prestigious and well-paid commissions</span>
				<span class='text'>Among other works from this period are ''[[Burial of St</span>
				<span class='text'>Lucy (Caravaggio)|Burial of St</span>
				<span class='text'>Lucy]]'', ''[[The Raising of Lazarus - Messina (Caravaggio)|The Raising of Lazarus]]'', and ''[[Adoration of the Shepherds (Caravaggio)|Adoration of the Shepherds]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>His style continued to evolve, showing now friezes of figures isolated against vast empty backgrounds</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;His great Sicilian altarpieces isolate their shadowy, pitifully poor figures in vast areas of darkness; they suggest the desperate fears and frailty of man, and at the same time convey, with a new yet desolate tenderness, the beauty of humility and of the meek, who shall inherit the earth</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Langdon, p</span>
				<span class='text'>65</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary reports depict a man whose behaviour was becoming increasingly bizarre, sleeping fully armed and in his clothes, ripping up a painting at a slight word of criticism, mocking the local painters</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Caravaggio displayed bizarre behaviour from very early in his career</span>
				<span class='text'>Mancini describes him as &quot;extremely crazy&quot;, a letter of Del Monte notes his strangeness, and Mario Minniti's 1724 biographer says that Mario left Caravaggio because of his behaviour</span>
				<span class='text'>The strangeness seems to have increased after Malta</span>
				<span class='text'>Susinno's early 18th century ''Le vite de' pittori Messinesi'', &quot;Lives of the Painters of Messina&quot;, provides several colourful anecdotes of Caravaggio's erratic behaviour in Sicily, and these are reproduced in modern full-length biographies such as Langdon and Robb</span>
				<span class='text'>Bellori writes of Caravaggio's &quot;fear&quot; driving him from city to city across the island and finally, &quot;feeling that it was no longer safe to remain&quot;, to Naples</span>
				<span class='text'>Baglione says Caravaggio was being &quot;chased by his enemy&quot;, but like Bellori does not say who this enemy was</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;[[File:CaravaggioSalomeMadrid</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|''David with the Head of Goliath'', 1609–1610, [[Galleria Borghese]], [[Rome]]</span>
				<span class='text'>]After only nine months in Sicily, Caravaggio returned to Naples</span>
				<span class='text'>According to his earliest biographer he was being pursued by enemies while in Sicily and felt it safest to place himself under the protection of the Colonnas until he could secure his pardon from the pope (now [[Paul V]]) and return to Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Baglione says that Caravaggio in Naples had &quot;given up all hope of revenge&quot; against his unnamed enemy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In Naples he painted ''[[The Denial of Saint Peter (Caravaggio)|The Denial of Saint Peter]]'', a final ''[[John the Baptist (Caravaggio)|John the Baptist (Borghese)]]'', and his last picture, ''[[The Martyrdom of Saint Ursula (Caravaggio)|The Martyrdom of Saint Ursula]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>His style continued to evolve — [[Saint Ursula]] is caught in a moment of highest action and drama, as the arrow fired by the king of the [[Huns]] strikes her in the breast, unlike earlier paintings which had all the immobility of the posed models</span>
				<span class='text'>The brushwork was much freer and more impressionistic</span>
				<span class='text'>n Naples an attempt was made on his life, by persons unknown</span>
				<span class='text'>At first it was reported in Rome that the &quot;famous artist&quot; Caravaggio was dead, but then it was learned that he was alive, but seriously disfigured in the face</span>
				<span class='text'>He painted a ''[[Salome with the Head of John the Baptist (Madrid) (Caravaggio)|Salome with the Head of John the Baptist (Madrid)]]'', showing his own head on a platter, and sent it to de Wignacourt as a plea for forgiveness</span>
				<span class='text'>Perhaps at this time he painted also a ''[[David with the Head of Goliath]]'', showing the young David with a strangely sorrowful expression gazing on the severed head of the giant, which is again Caravaggio's</span>
				<span class='text'>This painting he may have sent to his patron the unscrupulous art-loving Cardinal [[Scipione Borghese]], nephew of the pope, who had the power to grant or withhold pardons</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;According to a 17th-century writer the painting the head of Goliath is a self-portrait of the artist, while David is ''il suo Caravaggino'', &quot;his little Caravaggio&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>This phrase is obscure, but it has been interpreted as meaning either that the boy is a youthful self-portrait, or, more commonly, that this is the Cecco who modelled for the ''Amor Vincit''</span>
				<span class='text'>The sword-blade carries an abbreviated inscription which has been interpreted as meaning Humility Conquers Pride</span>
				<span class='text'>Attributed to a date in Caravaggio's late Roman period by Bellori, the recent tendency is to see it as a product on Caravaggio's second Neapolitan period</span>
				<span class='text'>(See Gash, p</span>
				<span class='text'>25)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In the summer of 1610 he took a boat northwards to receive the pardon, which seemed imminent thanks to his powerful Roman friends</span>
				<span class='text'>With him were three last paintings, gifts for Cardinal Scipione</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;A letter from the [[Bishop of Caserta]] in Naples to Cardinal Scipione Borghese in Rome, dated 29 July 1610, informs the Cardinal that the Marchesa of Caravaggio is holding two John the Baptists and a Magdalene which were intended for Borghese</span>
				<span class='text'>These were presumably the price of Caravaggio's pardon from Borghese's uncle, the pope</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; What happened next is the subject of much confusion and conjecture</span>
				<span class='text'>The bare facts are that on 28 July an anonymous ''avviso'' (private newsletter) from Rome to the ducal court of Urbino reported that Caravaggio was dead</span>
				<span class='text'>Three days later another ''avviso'' said that he had died of fever on his way from Naples to Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>A poet friend of the artist later gave 18 July as the date of death, and a recent researcher claims to have discovered a death notice showing that the artist died on that day of a fever in [[Porto Ercole]], near [[Grosseto]] in [[Tuscany]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Human remains found in a church in Porto Ercole in 2010 are believed to almost certainly belong to Caravaggio</span>

				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt;Aside from the paintings, evidence also comes from the libel trial brought against Caravaggio by [[Giovanni Baglione]] in 1603</span>
				<span class='text'>Baglione accused Caravaggio and his friends of writing and distributing scurrilous doggerel attacking him; the pamphlets, according to Baglione's friend and witness Mao Salini, had been distributed by a certain Giovanni Battista, a ''bardassa,'' or boy prostitute, shared by Caravaggio and his friend Onorio Longhi</span>
				<span class='text'>Caravaggio denied knowing any young boy of that name, and the allegation was not followed up</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;The transcript of the trial is given in Walter Friedlander, &quot;Caravaggio Studies&quot; (Princeton, 1955, revised edn</span>
				<span class='text'>1969)&lt;/ref&gt; Baglione's painting of &quot;Divine Love&quot; has also been seen as a visual accusation of sodomy against Caravaggio</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Such accusations were damaging and dangerous as sodomy was a capital crime at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>Even though the authorities were unlikely to investigate such a well-connected person as Caravaggio: &quot;Once an artist had been smeared as a pederast, his work was smeared too</span>

				<span class='text'>&quot;/&gt; Francesco Susinoo in his later biography relates the story of how the artist was chased by a school-master in Sicily for spending too long gazing at the boys in his care</span>
				<span class='text'>Susino presents it as a misunderstanding, but Caravaggio may indeed have been seeking sexual solace; and the incident could explain one of his most homoerotic paintings: his last depiction of St John the Baptist</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Andrew Graham-Dixon, ''Caravaggio: A life sacred and profane'', Penguin, 2011, p</span>
				<span class='text'>12&lt;/ref&gt;The art historian, Andrew Graham-Dixon has summarised the debate:&lt;blockquote&gt;A lot has been made of Caravaggio's presumed homosexuality, which has in more than one previous account of his life been presented as the single key that explains everything, both the power of his art and the misfortunes of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>There is no absolute proof of it, only strong circumstantial evidence and much rumour</span>
				<span class='text'>The balance of probability suggests that Caravaggio did indeed have sexual relations with men</span>
				<span class='text'>But he certainly had female lovers</span>
				<span class='text'>Throughout the years that he spent in Rome he kept close company with a number of prostitutes</span>
				<span class='text'>The truth is that Caravaggio was as uneasy in his relationships as he was in most other aspects of life</span>

				<span class='text'>[[National Gallery of Ireland]], [[Dublin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Caravaggio's application of the [[chiaroscuro]] technique shows through on the faces and armour notwithstanding the lack of a visible shaft of light</span>
				<span class='text'>The figure on the extreme right is a self-portrait</span>
				<span class='text'>]===The birth of Baroque===Caravaggio &quot;put the oscuro (shadows) into [[chiaroscuro]]</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, p</span>
				<span class='text'>1</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Chiaroscuro was practiced long before he came on the scene, but it was Caravaggio who made the technique a dominant stylistic element, darkening the shadows and transfixing the subject in a blinding shaft of light</span>
				<span class='text'>With this came the acute observation of physical and psychological reality which formed the ground both for his immense popularity and for his frequent problems with his religious commissions</span>
				<span class='text'>He worked at great speed, from live models, scoring basic guides directly onto the canvas with the end of the brush handle; very few of Caravaggio's drawings appear to have survived, and it is likely that he preferred to work directly on the canvas</span>
				<span class='text'>The approach was [[anathema]] to the skilled artists of his day, who decried his refusal to work from drawings and to idealise his figures</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet the models were basic to his realism</span>
				<span class='text'>Some have been identified, including [[Mario Minniti]] and [[Francesco Boneri]], both fellow artists, Mario appearing as various figures in the early secular works, the young Francesco as a succession of angels, Baptists and Davids in the later canvasses</span>
				<span class='text'>His female models include [[Portrait of a Courtesan (Caravaggio)|Fillide Melandroni]], [[Martha and Mary Magdalene (Caravaggio)|Anna Bianchini]], and Maddalena Antognetti (the &quot;Lena&quot; mentioned in court documents of the &quot;artichoke&quot; case&lt;ref&gt;Much of the documentary evidence for Caravaggio's life in Rome comes from court records; the &quot;artichoke&quot; case refers to an occasion when the artist threw a dish of hot artichokes at a waiter</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; as Caravaggio's concubine), all well-known prostitutes, who appear as female religious figures including the Virgin and various saints</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Robb, ''passim'', makes a fairly exhaustive attempt to identify models and relate them to individual canvases</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Caravaggio himself appears in several paintings, his final self-portrait being as the witness on the far right to the ''[[The Martyrdom of Saint Ursula (Caravaggio)|Martyrdom of Saint Ursula]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Caravaggio's self-portraits run from the ''Sick Bacchus'' at the beginning of his career to the head of Goliath in the ''David with the Head of Goliath'' in Rome's Borghese Gallery</span>
				<span class='text'>Previous artists had included self-portraits as onlookers to the action, but Caravaggio's innovation was to include himself as a participant</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Caravaggio - Cena in Emmaus</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|''[[Supper at Emmaus (London) (Caravaggio)|Supper at Emmaus]]'', 1601</span>

				<span class='text'>[[National Gallery, London]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Caravaggio included himself as the figure on the top left</span>
				<span class='text'>]Caravaggio had a noteworthy ability to express in one scene of unsurpassed vividness the passing of a crucial moment</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[Supper at Emmaus (London) (Caravaggio)|The Supper at Emmaus]]'' depicts the recognition of Christ by his disciples: a moment before he is a fellow traveler, mourning the passing of the Messiah, as he never ceases to be to the inn-keeper's eyes, the second after, he is the Saviour</span>
				<span class='text'> In ''[[The Calling of St Matthew (Caravaggio)|The Calling of St Matthew]]'', the hand of the Saint points to himself as if he were saying &quot;who, me?&quot;, while his eyes, fixed upon the figure of Christ, have already said, &quot;Yes, I will follow you&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'> With ''[[The Raising of Lazarus (Caravaggio)|The Resurrection of Lazarus]]'', he goes a step further, giving us a glimpse of the actual physical process of resurrection</span>
				<span class='text'> The body of Lazarus is still in the throes of rigor mortis, but his hand, facing and recognizing that of Christ, is alive</span>
				<span class='text'>Other major [[Baroque]] artists would travel the same path, for example [[Bernini]], fascinated with themes from Ovid's ''[[Metamorphoses]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Death of the Virgin-Caravaggio (1606)</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|''[[Death of the Virgin (Caravaggio)|Death of the Virgin]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>1601–1606</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Louvre]], [[Paris]]</span>
				<span class='text'>]===The ''Caravaggisti''===The installation of the St</span>
				<span class='text'>Matthew paintings in the Contarelli Chapel had an immediate impact among the younger artists in Rome, and Caravaggism became the cutting edge for every ambitious young painter</span>
				<span class='text'>The first Caravaggisti included [[Orazio Gentileschi]] and [[Giovanni Baglione]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Baglione's Caravaggio phase was short-lived; Caravaggio later accused him of plagiarism and the two were involved in a long feud</span>
				<span class='text'>Baglione went on to write the first biography of Caravaggio</span>
				<span class='text'>In the next generation of Caravaggisti there were [[Carlo Saraceni]], [[Bartolomeo Manfredi]] and [[Orazio Borgianni]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Gentileschi, despite being considerably older, was the only one of these artists to live much beyond 1620, and ended up as court painter to [[Charles I of England]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His daughter [[Artemisia Gentileschi]] was also close to Caravaggio, and one of the most gifted of the movement</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet in Rome and in Italy it was not Caravaggio, but the influence of [[Annibale Carracci]], blending elements from the [[High Renaissance]] and Lombard realism, which ultimately triumphed</span>
				<span class='text'>aravaggio's brief stay in Naples produced a notable school of Neapolitan Caravaggisti, including [[Battistello Caracciolo]] and [[Carlo Sellitto]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Caravaggisti movement there ended with a terrible outbreak of plague in 1656, but the Spanish connection – Naples was a possession of Spain – was instrumental in forming the important Spanish branch of his influence</span>
				<span class='text'> group of Catholic artists from [[Utrecht]], the [[Utrecht School|&quot;Utrecht Caravaggisti&quot;]], travelled to Rome as students in the first years of the 17th century and were profoundly influenced by the work of Caravaggio, as Bellori describes</span>
				<span class='text'>On their return to the north this trend had a short-lived but influential flowering in the 1620s among painters like [[Hendrick ter Brugghen]], [[Gerrit van Honthorst]], [[Andries Both]] and [[Dirck van Baburen]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In the following generation the effects of Caravaggio, although attenuated, are to be seen in the work of [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] (who purchased one of his paintings for the Gonzaga of Mantua and painted a copy of the ''[[The Entombment of Christ (Caravaggio)|Entombment of Christ]]''), [[Vermeer]], [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt]], and [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]], the last of whom presumably saw his work during his various sojourns in Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>==Death and rebirth of a reputation===[[File:Caravaggio - La Deposizione di Cristo</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|left|''[[The Entombment of Christ (Caravaggio)|The Entombment of Christ]]'', (1602–1603), [[Pinacoteca Vaticana]], [[Rome]]</span>
				<span class='text'>]Caravaggio's innovations inspired the Baroque, but the Baroque took the drama of his chiaroscuro without the psychological realism</span>
				<span class='text'>While he directly influenced the style of the artists mentioned above, and, at a distance, the Frenchmen [[Georges de La Tour]] and [[Simon Vouet]], and the Spaniard [[Giuseppe Ribera]], within a few decades his works were being ascribed to less scandalous artists, or simply overlooked</span>
				<span class='text'>The Baroque, to which he contributed so much, had evolved, and fashions had changed, but perhaps more pertinently Caravaggio never established a workshop as the Carracci did, and thus had no school to spread his techniques</span>
				<span class='text'>Nor did he ever set out his underlying philosophical approach to art, the psychological realism which can only be deduced from his surviving work</span>
				<span class='text'>hus his reputation was doubly vulnerable to the critical demolition-jobs done by two of his earliest biographers, [[Giovanni Baglione]], a rival painter with a personal vendetta, and the influential 17th century critic [[Gian Pietro Bellori]], who had not known him but was under the influence of the earlier [[Giovanni Battista Agucchi]] and Bellori's friend [[Poussin]], in preferring the &quot;classical-idealistic&quot; tradition of the [[Bolognese school (painting)|Bolognese school]] led by the Carracci</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wikkkower, p</span>
				<span class='text'>266; also see criticism by fellow Italian [[Vincenzo Carducci]] (living in Spain), who calls Caravaggio an &quot;Antichrist&quot; of painting with &quot;monstrous&quot; talents of deception</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Baglione, his first biographer, played a considerable part in creating the legend of Caravaggio's unstable and violent character, as well as his inability to draw</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ostrow, 608&lt;/ref&gt;In the 1920s, art critic [[Fondazione Roberto Longhi|Roberto Longhi]] brought Caravaggio's name once more to the foreground, and placed him in the European tradition: &quot;[[Jusepe de Ribera|Ribera]], [[Vermeer]], La Tour and Rembrandt could never have existed without him</span>
				<span class='text'>And the art of [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]], [[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]] and [[Édouard Manet|Manet]] would have been utterly different&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Roberto Longhi, quoted in Lambert, op</span>
				<span class='text'>cit</span>
				<span class='text'> p</span>
				<span class='text'>5&lt;/ref&gt; The influential [[Bernard Berenson]] agreed: &quot;With the exception of [[Michelangelo]], no other Italian painter exercised so great an influence</span>
