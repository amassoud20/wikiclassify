				<span class='text'>In 1949 his friend [[Sid Caesar]] hired Brooks to write jokes for the NBC series ''[[The Admiral Broadway Revue]]'', paying him $50 a week</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1950 Caesar created the revolutionary variety comedy series ''Your Show of Shows'' and hired Brooks as a writer along with Carl Reiner, [[Neil Simon]], [[Danny Simon]], and head writer [[Mel Tolkin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman, John 1988&quot;/&gt; The show was an immediate hit and has been influential to all variety and sketch-comedy TV shows since</span>
				<span class='text'>Reiner, as creator of ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'', based [[Morey Amsterdam]]'s character Buddy Sorell on Brooks</span>
				<span class='text'>Likewise, the 1982 film ''[[My Favorite Year]]'' is loosely based on Brooks's experiences as a writer on the show and an encounter with aging Hollywood actor [[Errol Flynn]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Neil Simon's 1993 play ''[[Laughter on the 23rd Floor]]'' is also loosely based on the production of the show, and the character Ira Stone is based on Brooks</span>
				<span class='text'>''Your Show of Shows'' ended in 1954 when performer [[Imogene Coca]] left to host her own show</span>

				<span class='text'>{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}===''The 2000 Year Old Man'' and ''Get Smart''===Brooks and co-writer Reiner had become fast friends and began to casually improvise comedy routines when they were not working</span>
				<span class='text'>Reiner would play the straight man interviewer who would set Brooks up as anything from a Tibetan monk to an astronaut</span>
				<span class='text'>As Reiner explained, &quot;In the evening, we'd go to a party and I'd pick a character for him to play</span>
				<span class='text'>I never told him what it was going to be</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman, John 1988&quot;/&gt; On one of these occasions, Reiner's suggestion was a 2000-year-old man who had witnessed the crucifixion of Jesus Christ (who &quot;came in the store but never bought anything&quot;), had been married several hundred times, and had &quot;over forty-two thousand children, and not one comes to visit me</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; At first Brooks and Reiner would only perform the routine for friends, but by the late 1950s, it had gained a cult status in New York City</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Kenneth Tynan]] saw the [[comedy duo]] perform at a party in 1959 and wrote that Brooks &quot;was the most original comic improvisor I had ever seen</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman, John 1988&quot;/&gt;In 1960 Brooks moved from New York to Hollywood</span>
				<span class='text'>Reiner and Brooks began performing the &quot;2000 Year Old Man&quot; act on ''[[the Steve Allen Show]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}''The Producers'' was so brazen in its satire that major studios would not touch it, nor would many exhibitors</span>
				<span class='text'>Brooks finally found an independent distributor who released it as an art film, a specialized attraction</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1968, Brooks received an Oscar for [[Best Original Screenplay]] for the film, beating such writers as [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[John Cassavetes]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Borrowing heavily musically from &quot;It's Good to Be the King&quot;, it was still an unlikely hit, peaking at #12 on the UK Singles Chart in February 1984 and #3 on the Australian Singles Chart (Kent Music Report) that same year</span>
