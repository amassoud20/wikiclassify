				<span class='text'>]Sienkiewicz was born on 5 May 1846 in [[Wola Okrzejska]], a village in the eastern Polish region of [[Podlasie]], then part of the [[Russian Empire]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb203&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ErsoyGorny2010-163&quot;/&gt; His family were impoverished Polish nobles, on his father's side deriving from [[Lipka Tatars|Tatars]] who had settled in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb203&quot;/&gt; He had five siblings: an older brother, Kazimierz (died during [[January Uprising]]), and four sisters, Aniela, Helena, Zofia and Maria</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb203&quot;/&gt; His family were entitled to use the Polish [[Oszyk coat of arms]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Majchrowski1966&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Studencki1967&quot;/&gt; Wola Okrzejska belonged to the writer's maternal grandmother, Felicjana Cieciszowska</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb203&quot;/&gt; His family moved several times, and young Henryk spent his childhood on family estates in [[Grabowce Górne]], [[Wężyczyn]] and [[Burzec]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb203&quot;/&gt; In September 1858 he began his education in [[Warsaw]], where the family would finally settle in 1861, having bought a tenement house (''[[Kamienica (architecture)|kamienica]]'') in eastern Warsaw's [[Praga]] district</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb203&quot;/&gt; He received relatively poor school grades except in the humanities, notably Polish language and history</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb203&quot;/&gt;Due to the hard times, 19-year-old Sienkiewicz took a job as tutor to the [[Weyher family]] in [[Płońsk]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb203&quot;/&gt; It was probably in this period that he wrote his first novel, ''Ofiara'' (Sacrifice); he is thought to have destroyed the manuscript of the never-published novel</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb203&quot;/&gt; He also worked on his first novel to be published, ''Na marne'' (In Vain)</span>
				<span class='text'> He completed extramural secondary-school classes, and in 1866 he received his secondary-school diploma</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb203&quot;/&gt; He first tried to study medicine, then law, at the [[Warsaw University|Imperial University of Warsaw]], but he soon transferred to the university's Institute of Philology and History, where he acquired a thorough knowledge of literature and [[Old Polish Language]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb203&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ErsoyGorny2010-163&quot;/&gt; Little is known about this period of his life, other than that he moved out of his parents' home, tutored part-time, and lived in poverty</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb203&quot;/&gt; His situation improved somewhat in 1868 when he became tutor to the princely Woroniecki family</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb203&quot;/&gt;In 1867 he wrote a rhymed piece, &quot;''Sielanka Młodości''&quot; (&quot;Idyl of Youth&quot;), which was rejected by ''[[Tygodnik Ilustrowany]]'' (The Illustrated Weekly)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb203&quot;/&gt; In 1869 he debuted as a journalist; Przegląd Tygodniowy (1866-1904) (The Weekly Review) ran his review of a play on 18 April 1869, and shortly afterward ''The Illustrated Weekly'' printed an essay of his about the late-Renaissance Polish poet [[Mikołaj Sęp Szarzyński]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb203&quot;/&gt; He completed his university studies in 1871, though he failed to receive a diploma because he did not pass the examination in [[Greek language]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb203&quot;/&gt; Sienkiewicz also wrote for ''Gazeta Polska'' (The Polish Gazette) and Niwa (magazine), under the pen name &quot;Litwos&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb204&quot;/&gt; In 1873 he began writing a column, ''&quot;Bez tytułu''&quot; (&quot;Without a title&quot;), in ''The Polish Gazette''; in 1874 a column, &quot;''Sprawy bieżące''&quot; (&quot;Current matters&quot;) for ''Niwa''; and in 1875 the column, &quot;''Chwila obecna''&quot; (&quot;The present moment&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb204&quot;/&gt; He also collaborated on a Polish translation, published in 1874, of [[Victor Hugo]]'s last novel, ''[[Ninety-Three]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb204&quot;/&gt; In June that year, he became co-owner of ''Niwa'' (in 1878, he would sell his share in the magazine)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb204&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;psb205&quot;/&gt;Meanwhile, in 1872, he had debuted as a fiction writer with his short novel Na marne (In Vain), published in the magazine Wieniec (magazine) (Garland)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb203&quot;/&gt; This was followed by  Humoreski z teki Woroszyłły (Humorous Sketches from Woroszyłła's Files, 1872), Stary Sługa (The Old Servant, 1875), Hania (Sienkiewicz) (1876) and Selim Mirza (1877)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb204&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ihnatowicz2000&quot;/&gt; The last three are known as the &quot;Little Trilogy&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ihnatowicz2000&quot;/&gt; These publications made him a prominent figure in Warsaw's journalistic-literary world, and a guest at popular dinner parties hosted by actress [[Helena Modrzejewska]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb204&quot;/&gt; Soon after he returned, his fiancée's parents cancelled the engagement</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb204&quot;/&gt; In 1876 Sienkiewicz went to the United States with Helena Modrzejewska (soon to become famous in the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>as actress [[Helena Modjeska]]) and her husband</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb204&quot;/&gt; He traveled via London to New York and then on to San Francisco, staying for some time in California</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb204&quot;/&gt; His travels were financed by ''Gazeta Polska'' (The Polish Gazette) in exchange for a series of travel essays: Sienkiewicz wrote Listy z podróży (Letters from a Journey) and ''Listy Litwosa z Podróży'' (Litwos' Letters from a Journey), which were published in ''The Polish Gazette'' in 1876–78 and republished as a book in 1880</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb204&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RęboszPierściński1996&quot;/&gt; Other articles by him also appeared in ''Przegląd Tygodniowy'' (The Weekly Review) and ''Przewodnik Naukowy i Literacki'' (The Learned and Literary Guide), discussing the situation of [[American Polonia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb205&quot;/&gt; He briefly lived in the town of [[Anaheim]], later in Anaheim Landing (now [[Seal Beach, California]])</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb204&quot;/&gt; He hunted, visited [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] camps, traveled in the nearby mountains (the [[Santa Ana Mountains|Santa Ana]], [[Sierra Madre Mountains (California)|Sierra Madre]], [[San Jacinto Mountains|San Jacinto]], and [[San Bernardino Mountains]]), and visited the [[Mojave Desert]], [[Yosemite Valley]], and the [[silver mine]]s at [[Virginia City, Nevada]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb204&quot;/&gt; On 20 August 1877 he witnessed Modjeska's U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>theatrical debut at San Francisco's [[California Theatre (San Francisco)|California Theatre]], which he reviewed for ''The Polish Gazette''; and on 8 September he published in the Daily Evening Post an article, translated into English for him by Modjeska, on &quot;Poland and Russia&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb204&quot;/&gt;In America he also continued writing fiction, in 1877 publishing Szkice węglem (Charcoal Sketches) in ''The Polish Gazette''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb205&quot;/&gt; He wrote a play, ''Na przebój'', soon retitled ''Na jedną kartę'' (On a Single Card), later staged at [[Lviv]] (1879) and, to a better reception, at Warsaw (1881)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb205&quot;/&gt; He also wrote a play for Modjeska, aimed at an American public, ''Z walki tutejszych partii'' (Partisan Struggles), but it was never performed or published, and the manuscript appears to be lost</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb205&quot;/&gt;On 24 March 1878 Sienkiewicz left the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>for Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb205&quot;/&gt; He first stayed in London, then for a year in Paris, delaying his return to Poland due to rumors of possible conscription into the [[Imperial Russian Army]] on the eve of a predicted new war with Turkey</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb205&quot;/&gt; In [[Lviv]] (Lwów) he gave a lecture that was not well attended: &quot;''Z Nowego Jorku do Kalifornii''&quot; (&quot;From New York to California&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb205&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kulczycka-Saloni1960&quot;/&gt; Subsequent lectures in [[Szczawnica]] and [[Krynica-Zdrój|Krynica]]&lt;!--sources do not specify which Krynica, other than it was near Szczawnica and Lwow; Krynica-Zdrój seems most likely--&gt; in July–August that year, and in Warsaw and [[Poznań]] the following year, were much more successful</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb205&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;psb206&quot;/&gt; In late summer 1879 he went to Venice and Rome, which he toured for the next few weeks, on 7 November 1879 returning to Warsaw</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb205&quot;/&gt; There he met Maria Szetkiewicz, whom he married on 18 August 1881</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb205&quot;/&gt; The marriage was reportedly a happy one</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb206&quot;/&gt; The couple had two children, Henryk Józef (1882–1959) and Jadwiga Maria (1883–1969)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb205&quot;/&gt; It was a short-lived marriage, however, because on 18 August 1885 Maria died of [[tuberculosis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb207&quot;/&gt;In 1879 the first collected edition of Sienkiewicz's works was published, in four volumes; the series would continue to 1917, ending with a total of 17 volumes</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb205&quot;/&gt; He also continued writing journalistic pieces, mainly in ''The Polish Gazette'' and ''Niwa''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb205&quot;/&gt; In 1881 he published a favorable review of the first collected edition of works by [[Bolesław Prus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb206&quot;/&gt;In 1880 Sienkiewicz wrote a historical novella, Niewola tatarska (Tartar Captivity)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb205&quot;/&gt; In late 1881 he became editor-in-chief of a new Warsaw newspaper, ''Słowo'' (The Word)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb206&quot;/&gt; This substantially improved his finances</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb206&quot;/&gt; The year 1882 saw him heavily engaged in the running of the newspaper, in which he published a number of columns and short stories</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb206&quot;/&gt; Soon, however, he lost interest in the journalistic aspect and decided to focus more on his literary work</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb206&quot;/&gt; He paid less and less attention to his post of editor-in-chief, resigning it in 1887 but remaining editor of the paper's literary section until 1892</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb207&quot;/&gt;From 1883 he increasingly shifted his focus from short pieces to historical novels</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb206&quot;/&gt; He began work on the historical novel, ''Ogniem i Mieczem'' ([[With Fire and Sword]])</span>
				<span class='text'> Initially titled ''Wilcze gniazdo'' (The Wolf's Lair), it appeared in [[serial novel|serial installments]] in ''The Word'' from May 1883 to March 1884</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb206&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;psb207&quot;/&gt; It also ran concurrently in the Kraków newspaper, ''Czas'' (Time)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb206&quot;/&gt;Sienkiewicz soon began writing the second volume of his Trilogy, ''[[The Deluge (novel)|Potop]]'' (The Deluge)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb207&quot;/&gt; It ran in ''The Word'' from December 1884 to September 1886</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb207&quot;/&gt; Beginning in 1884, Sienkiewicz accompanied his wife Maria to foreign [[sanatorium]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb207&quot;/&gt; After her death, he kept on traveling Europe, leaving his children with his late wife's parents, though he often returned to Poland, particularly staying for long periods in Warsaw and [[Kraków]] beginning in the 1890s</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb207&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;psb208&quot;/&gt; After his return to Warsaw in 1887, the third volume of his [[The Trilogy|Trilogy]] appeared – ''[[Pan Wołodyjowski]]'' (Sir Michael) – running in ''The Word'' from May 1887 to May 1888</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb207&quot;/&gt; The Trilogy established Sienkiewicz as the most popular contemporary Polish writer</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb207&quot;/&gt;Sienkiewicz received 15,000 [[ruble]]s, in recognition of his achievements, from an unknown admirer who signed himself &quot;[[Michał Wołodyjowski]]&quot; after the Trilogy character</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb207&quot;/&gt; Sienkiewicz used the money to set up a fund, named for his wife and supervised by the [[Academy of Learning]], to aid artists endangered by tuberculosis</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb207&quot;/&gt;In 1886 he visited [[Istanbul]]; in 1888, Spain</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb207&quot;/&gt; At the end of 1890 he went to Africa, resulting in ''Listy z Afryki'' (Letters from Africa, published in ''The Word'' in 1891–92, then collected as a book in 1893)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb207&quot;/&gt; The turn of the 1880s and 1890s was associated with intensive work on several novels</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1891 his novel ''[[Without dogma]]'' (''Bez Dogmatu''), previously serialized in 1889–90 in ''The Word'', was published in book form</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb208&quot;/&gt; In 1892 Sienkiewicz signed an agreement for another novel, Rodzina Połanieckich (Children of the Soil), which was serialized in ''The Polish Gazette'' from 1893 and came out in book form in 1894</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb208&quot;/&gt;===Later years===Sienkiewicz would have several romances, and in 1892 Maria Romanowska-Wołodkowicz, stepdaughter of a wealthy [[Odessa]]n, entered his life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb208&quot;/&gt; He and Romanowska became engaged there in 1893 and married in Kraków on 11 November</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb208&quot;/&gt; Just two weeks later, however, his bride left him; Sienkiewicz blamed &quot;in-law intrigues&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'> On 13 December 1895 he obtained [[pope|papal]] consent to dissolution of the marriage</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb208&quot;/&gt; In 1904 he [[Avunculate marriage|married his niece]], Maria Babska</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb208&quot;/&gt;Sienkiewicz used his growing international fame to influence world opinion in favor of the Polish cause (throughout his life and since the late 18th century, Poland remained [[Partitions of Poland|partitioned]] by her neighbors, Russia, Austria and Prussia, later Germany)</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb209&quot;/&gt;In 1900, with a three-year delay due to the approaching centenary of [[Mickiewicz]]'s birth, Sienkiewicz celebrated his own quarter-century, begun in 1872, as a writer</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb212&quot;/&gt; He wrote a new historical novel, Na polu chwały (On the Field of Glory), that was meant as the beginning of a new trilogy; it was, however, criticized as being a lesser version of his original [[The Trilogy|Trilogy]], and was never continued</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb212&quot;/&gt; Similarly, his contemporary novel ''Wiry'' Whirlpool (novel), 1910, which sought to criticize some of Sienkiewicz's political opponents, received a mostly polemical and politicized response</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb213&quot;/&gt; His 1910 novel for young people, ''W pustyni i w puszczy'' (In Desert and Wilderness), serialized in ''Kurier Warszawski'' (The Warsaw Courier), finishing in 1911, was much better received and became widely popular among children and young adults</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ErsoyGorny2010-164&quot;/&gt; Unlike most other Polish Positivist writers, Sienkiewicz was a conservative</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ErsoyGorny2010-164&quot;/&gt; His Little Trilogy (''Stary Sługa'', 1875; ''Hania'', 1876; ''Selim Mirza'', 1877) shows his interest in [[history of Poland|Polish history]] and his literary maturity, including fine mastery of humor and drama</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb204&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;psb205&quot;/&gt; His early works focused on three themes: the oppression and poverty of the peasants (&quot;Charcoal Sketches&quot;, 1877); criticism of the partitioning powers (&quot;''Z pamiętnika korepetytora''&quot;, &quot;''[[Janko Muzykant]]''&quot; [&quot;Janko the Musician&quot;], 1879); and his voyage to the United States (&quot;''Za chelebem''&quot;, &quot;For Bread&quot;, 1880)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb205&quot;/&gt; His most common motif was the plight of the powerless: impoverished peasants, schoolchildren, emigrants</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb205&quot;/&gt;His &quot;''Latarnik''&quot; (&quot;The Lighthouse Keeper&quot;, 1881) has been described as one of the best Polish short stories</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb205&quot;/&gt; His 1882 stories &quot;''Bartek Zwycięzca''&quot; (&quot;Bart the Conqueror&quot;) and &quot;''Sachem''&quot; draw parallels between the tragic fates of their heroes and that of the occupied Polish nation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb206&quot;/&gt;His novel ''With Fire and Sword'' (1883–84) was enthusiastically received by readers (as were the next two volumes of [[The Trilogy]]), becoming an &quot;instant classic&quot;, though critical reception was lukewarm</span>

				<span class='text'>]Sienkiewicz's ''[[Without dogma]]'' (''Bez dogmatu'', 1889–90) was a notable artistic experiment, a self-analytical novel written as a fictitious diary</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb208&quot;/&gt; His works of the period are critical of [[Decadent movement|decadent]] and [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalistic]] philosophies</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb209&quot;/&gt; He had expressed his opinions on naturalism and writing, generally, early on in &quot;''O naturaliźmie w powieści''&quot; (&quot;Naturalism in the Novel&quot;, 1881)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb205&quot;/&gt; A dozen years later, in 1893, he wrote that novels should strengthen and ennoble life, rather than undermining and debasing it</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb209&quot;/&gt; Later, in the early 1900s, he fell into mutual hostility with the [[Young Poland]] movement in Polish literature</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb211&quot;/&gt;These views informed his novel [[Quo Vadis (novel)|''Quo Vadis'']] (1896)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb209&quot;/&gt; This story of [[early Christianity]] in Rome, with protagonists struggling against the [[Emperor Nero]]'s regime, draws parallels between repressed early Christians and contemporary Poles; and, due to its focus on Christianity, it became widely popular in the Christian [[Western culture|West]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;KurianIII2010&quot;/&gt; The triumph of spiritual Christianity over materialist Rome was a critique of [[materialism]] and decadence, and also an allegory for the strength of the Polish spirit</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;psb209&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ErsoyGorny2010-165&quot;/&gt; The book quickly became another Sienkiewicz bestseller in Poland, and was received by critics better than his Trilogy had been; it was also applauded by the Polish right-wing, anti-German [[National Democracy]] political movement, and became part of the Polish school curriculum after Poland regained independence in 1918</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ErsoyGorny2010-165&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ErsoyGorny2010-166&quot;/&gt;It is often incorrectly asserted that Sienkiewicz received his Nobel Prize for ''Quo Vadis''</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;The Nobel Prize in Literature 1905&quot;/&gt;Sienkiewicz often carried out substantial historic research for his novels, but he was selective in the findings that made it into the novels</span>
