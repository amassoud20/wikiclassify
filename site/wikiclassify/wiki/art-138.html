				<span class='text'>html|title=How to say: Bowie|accessdate=16 September 2010|publisher=BBC|date=8 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was an English singer, songwriter, record producer, painter and actor</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a figure in [[popular music]] for over five decades, and was considered by critics and other musicians as an innovator, particularly for his work in the 1970s</span>
				<span class='text'>Born and raised in [[south London]], Bowie developed an interest in music while at Burnt Ash junior school and showed aptitude in singing and playing the [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]]</span>
				<span class='text'>When he left school he studied art, music and design, and became proficient on the saxophone, forming his first band that year at the age of 15</span>
				<span class='text'>He embarked on a professional career as a musician in 1963, and received his first management contract shortly afterwards</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;[[Space Oddity]]&quot; became his first top five entry on the [[UK Singles Chart]] after its release in July 1969</span>
				<span class='text'>After a period of experimentation, he re-emerged in 1972 during the [[glam rock]] era with his flamboyant and androgynous [[alter ego]] Ziggy Stardust</span>
				<span class='text'>The character was spearheaded by his single &quot;[[Starman (song)|Starman]]&quot; and album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The relatively short-lived Ziggy persona proved to be one facet of a career marked by reinvention, musical innovation and visual presentation</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1975, Bowie achieved his first major American crossover success with the number-one single &quot;[[Fame (David Bowie song)|Fame]]&quot; and the album ''[[Young Americans (album)|Young Americans]]'', which the singer characterised as &quot;[[plastic soul]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The sound constituted a radical shift in style that initially alienated many of his UK devotees</span>
				<span class='text'>He then confounded the expectations of both his record label and his American audiences by recording the [[electronic music|electronic]]-inflected album ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]'' (1977), the first of three collaborations with [[Brian Eno]] later known as the &quot;Berlin Trilogy&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[&quot;Heroes&quot; (David Bowie album)|&quot;Heroes&quot;]]'' (1977) and ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]'' (1979) followed; each album reached the UK top five and received lasting critical praise</span>
				<span class='text'>After uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had UK number ones with the 1980 single &quot;[[Ashes to Ashes (David Bowie song)|Ashes to Ashes]]&quot;, its parent album ''[[Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)]]'', and &quot;[[Under Pressure]]&quot;, a 1981 collaboration with [[Queen (band)|Queen]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He then reached a new commercial peak in 1983 with ''[[Let's Dance (David Bowie album)|Let's Dance]]'', which yielded several successful singles</span>
				<span class='text'>Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, including [[industrial music|industrial]] and [[drum and bass|jungle]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also had a successful but sporadic [[David Bowie filmography|film career]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His acting roles include the eponymous character in ''[[The Man Who Fell to Earth]]'' (1976), Major Celliers in ''[[Merry Christmas, Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Lawrence]]'' (1983), the Goblin King [[Jareth]] in ''[[Labyrinth (film)|Labyrinth]]'' (1986), [[Pontius Pilate]] in ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ (film)|The Last Temptation of Christ]]'' (1988), and [[Nikola Tesla]] in ''[[The Prestige (film)|The Prestige]]'' (2006), among other film and television appearances and cameos</span>
				<span class='text'>owie's impact was enormous; he changed the nature of rock music, and changed his own approach repeatedly</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;!-- See § &quot;Legacy and influence&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>--&gt; During his career, he sold an estimated 140 million records worldwide</span>
				<span class='text'>In the UK, he was awarded nine platinum album certifications, eleven gold and eight silver, and in the US received five platinum and seven gold certifications</span>
				<span class='text'>He was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1996</span>
				<span class='text'>Bowie stopped concert touring after 2004, and last performed live at a charity event in 2006</span>
				<span class='text'>In 2013, he returned from a decade-long recording hiatus, remaining musically active until his death from [[liver cancer]] three years later</span>
				<span class='text'>=Early life==Bowie was born in [[Brixton]], south London</span>
				<span class='text'>His mother, Margaret Mary &quot;Peggy&quot; (née Burns), of Irish descent, was born in [[Kent]],&lt;ref&gt;Gillman (1987) p</span>
				<span class='text'>7 &quot;[Peggy] was born in the hospital at Shorncliffe Camp [near Folkestone, Kent] on October 2nd, 1913</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; p</span>
				<span class='text'>5 &quot;[Her father] Jimmy Burns's parents were poor Irish immigrants who had settled in Manchester&quot; p</span>
				<span class='text'>6 &quot;[Jimmy] had known [her mother] in Manchester</span>
				<span class='text'>Her name was Margaret Heaton&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; worked as a waitress,&lt;ref&gt;Gillman (1987) p</span>
				<span class='text'>4 &quot;At the end of the war, Peggy Burns was working as a waitress at the Ritz cinema in Tunbridge Wells&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; while his father, Haywood Stenton &quot;John&quot; Jones, from [[Yorkshire]],&lt;ref&gt;Gillman (1987) p</span>
				<span class='text'>44 &quot;John Jones was born in the grimy Yorkshire town of Doncaster in 1912</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt; a promotions officer for the children's charity [[Barnardo's]], was of Welsh descent</span>
				<span class='text'>The family lived at 40 Stansfield Road, near the border of the south London areas of Brixton and [[Stockwell]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Bowie attended Stockwell Infants School until he was six years old, acquiring a reputation as a gifted and single-minded child—and a defiant brawler</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Sandford (1997): pp</span>
				<span class='text'>9–16&lt;/ref&gt;In 1953, Bowie moved with his family to the suburb of [[Bromley]], where, two years later, he progressed to Burnt Ash Junior School</span>
				<span class='text'>His voice was considered &quot;adequate&quot; by the school choir, and he demonstrated above-average abilities in playing the [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;sandford18-19&quot;&gt;Sandford (1997): pp</span>
				<span class='text'>18–19&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of nine, his dancing during the newly introduced [[music and movement]] classes was strikingly imaginative: teachers called his interpretations &quot;vividly artistic&quot; and his poise &quot;astonishing&quot; for a child</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;sandford18-19&quot;/&gt; The same year, his interest in music was further stimulated when his father brought home a collection of American [[Gramophone record|45s]] by artists including [[Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers]], [[the Platters]], [[Fats Domino]], [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Little Richard]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Buckley (2000): p</span>
				<span class='text'>21</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sandford19-20&quot; /&gt; Upon listening to &quot;[[Tutti Frutti (song)|Tutti Frutti]]&quot;, Bowie would later say, &quot;I had heard God&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Doggett|first=Peter|title=Teenage Wildlife|journal=Mojo Classic|date=January 2007|issue=60 Years of Bowie|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presley's impact on him was likewise emphatic: &quot;I saw a cousin of mine dance to&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>'[[Hound Dog (song)|Hound Dog]]' and I had never seen her get up and be moved so much by anything</span>
				<span class='text'>It really impressed me, the power of the music</span>
				<span class='text'>I started getting records immediately after that</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sandford19-20&quot;&gt;Sandford (1997): pp</span>
				<span class='text'>19–20&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the following year he had taken up the [[ukulele]] and [[tea-chest bass]] and begun to participate in [[skiffle]] sessions with friends, and had started to play the piano; meanwhile his stage presentation of numbers by both Presley and [[Chuck Berry]]—complete with gyrations in tribute to the original artists—to his local [[Cub Scout|Wolf Cub]] group was described as &quot;mesmerizing&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>like someone from another planet</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sandford19-20&quot; /&gt; After taking his [[eleven plus exam]] at the conclusion of his Burnt Ash Junior education, Bowie went to [[Ravens Wood School|Bromley Technical High School]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;bromleytech&quot;/&gt;It was an unusual technical school, as biographer Christopher Sandford wrote: {{blockquote|Despite its status it was, by the time David arrived in 1958, as rich in arcane ritual as any [English] [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|public school]]</span>
				<span class='text'>There were [[House system|houses]], named after eighteenth-century statesmen like [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|Pitt]] and [[William Wilberforce|Wilberforce]]</span>
				<span class='text'>There was a uniform, and an elaborate system of rewards and punishments</span>
				<span class='text'>There was also an accent on languages, science and particularly design, where a collegiate atmosphere flourished under the tutorship of Owen Frampton</span>
				<span class='text'>In David's account, Frampton led through force of personality, not intellect; his colleagues at Bromley Tech were famous for neither, and yielded the school's most gifted pupils to the arts, a regime so liberal that Frampton actively encouraged his own son, [[Peter Frampton|Peter]], to pursue a musical career with David, a partnership briefly intact thirty years later</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;bromleytech&quot;&gt;Sandford (1997): pp</span>
				<span class='text'>21–22&lt;/ref&gt;}}Bowie studied art, music and design, including layout and typesetting</span>
				<span class='text'>After Terry Burns, his half-brother, introduced him to modern jazz, his enthusiasm for players like [[Charles Mingus]] and [[John Coltrane]] led his mother to give him a plastic [[alto saxophone]] in 1961; he was soon receiving lessons from a local musician</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Sandford (1997): p</span>
				<span class='text'>25&lt;/ref&gt; Bowie received a serious injury at school in 1962 when his friend [[George Underwood (artist)|George Underwood]] punched him in the left eye during a fight over a girl</span>
				<span class='text'>Doctors feared he would become blind in that eye</span>
				<span class='text'>After a series of operations during a four-month hospitalisation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rock 'n' Roll's Strangest Moments: Extraordinary Tales from Over Fifty Years|last=Evans|first=Mike|publisher=Anova Books|year=2006|isbn=978-1-86105-923-9|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; his doctors determined that the damage could not be fully repaired and Bowie was left with faulty [[depth perception]] and a [[anisocoria|permanently dilated pupil]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite their altercation, Underwood and Bowie remained good friends, and Underwood went on to create the artwork for Bowie's early albums</span>

				<span class='text'>9&lt;/ref&gt;==Career=====1962–67: Early career to debut album===[[File:David Bowie (1967)</span>
				<span class='text'>ng|thumb|upright|alt=Bowie looking to the camera|Bowie in 1967]]Graduating from his plastic saxophone to a real instrument in 1962, Bowie formed his first band at the age of 15</span>
				<span class='text'>Playing guitar-based [[rock and roll]] at local youth gatherings and weddings, the Konrads had a varying line-up of between four and eight members, Underwood among them</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Sandford (1997): p</span>
				<span class='text'>28&lt;/ref&gt; When Bowie left the technical school the following year, he informed his parents of his intention to become a pop star</span>
				<span class='text'>His mother promptly arranged his employment as an electrician's mate</span>
				<span class='text'>Frustrated by his band-mates' limited aspirations, Bowie left the Konrads and joined another band, the King Bees</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote to the newly successful washing-machine entrepreneur [[John Bloom (businessman)|John Bloom]] inviting him to &quot;do for us what Brian Epstein has done for the Beatles—and make another million</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Bloom did not respond to the offer, but his referral to [[Dick James]]'s partner Leslie Conn led to Bowie's first personal management contract</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;sandford29-30&quot;&gt;Sandford (1997): pp</span>
				<span class='text'>29–30&lt;/ref&gt;Conn quickly began to promote Bowie</span>
				<span class='text'>The singer's debut single, &quot;[[Liza Jane (David Bowie song)|Liza Jane]]&quot;, credited to Davie Jones and the King Bees, had no commercial success</span>
				<span class='text'>Dissatisfied with the King Bees and their repertoire of [[Howlin' Wolf]] and [[Willie Dixon]] blues numbers, Bowie quit the band less than a month later to join the Manish Boys, another blues outfit, who incorporated folk and soul—&quot;I used to dream of being their [[Mick Jagger]]&quot;, Bowie was to recall</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;sandford29-30&quot; /&gt; &quot;[[I Pity the Fool]]&quot; was no more successful than &quot;Liza Jane&quot;, and Bowie soon moved on again to join the Lower Third, a blues trio strongly influenced by [[the Who]]</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;[[You've Got a Habit of Leaving]]&quot; fared no better, signalling the end of Conn's contract</span>
				<span class='text'>Declaring that he would exit the pop world &quot;to study mime at [[Sadler's Wells Theatre|Sadler's Wells]]&quot;, Bowie nevertheless remained with the Lower Third</span>
				<span class='text'>His new manager, Ralph Horton, later instrumental in his transition to solo artist, soon witnessed Bowie's move to yet another group, the Buzz, yielding the singer's fifth unsuccessful single release, &quot;[[Do Anything You Say]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>While with the Buzz, Bowie also joined the [[The Riot Squad|Riot Squad]]; their recordings, which included a Bowie number and [[The Velvet Underground]] material, went unreleased</span>
				<span class='text'>Ken Pitt, introduced by Horton, took over as Bowie's manager</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Sandford (1997): pp</span>
				<span class='text'>35–39&lt;/ref&gt;Dissatisfied with his stage name as Davy (and Davie) Jones, which in the mid-1960s invited confusion with [[Davy Jones (musician)|Davy Jones]] of [[the Monkees]], Bowie renamed himself after the 19th-century American [[Frontier#American frontier|frontiersman]] [[Jim Bowie]] and [[Bowie knife|the knife he had popularised]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Buckley (2000): p</span>
				<span class='text'>33&lt;/ref&gt; His April 1967 solo single, &quot;[[The Laughing Gnome]]&quot;, using speeded-up thus high-pitched vocals, failed to chart</span>
				<span class='text'>Released six weeks later, his album debut, ''[[David Bowie (1967 album)|David Bowie]]'', an amalgam of pop, [[psychedelic rock|psychedelia]], and [[music hall]], met the same fate</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;buckley135-6&quot; /&gt; The show was hugely popular, catapulting him to stardom as he toured the UK over the next six months and creating, as described by Buckley, a &quot;cult of Bowie&quot; that was &quot;unique—its influence lasted longer and has been more creative than perhaps almost any other force within pop fandom</span>
