				<span class='text'>From there, Miyazaki worked as an [[Inbetweening|in-between artist]] for ''[[Gulliver's Travels Beyond the Moon]]'', where he pitched ideas that eventually became the movie's ending</span>
				<span class='text'>He continued to work in various roles in the animation industry until he directed his first feature film, ''Lupin III: [[The Castle of Cagliostro]]'', released in 1979</span>
				<span class='text'> After the success of his next film, ''[[Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (film)|Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind]]'' (1984), he co-founded Studio Ghibli, where he continued to produce many feature films</span>
				<span class='text'>While Miyazaki's films have long enjoyed both commercial and critical success in Japan, he remained largely unknown to the West until [[Miramax Films]] released ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'' (1997)</span>
				<span class='text'> ''Princess Mononoke'' was briefly the highest-grossing film in Japan until it was eclipsed by another 1997 film, ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', and it became the first animated film to win Picture of the Year at the [[Japan Academy Prize (film)|Japanese Academy Awards]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Miyazaki's next film, ''[[Spirited Away]]'' (2001), topped ''Titanic''’s sales at the Japanese box office, won Picture of the Year at the Japanese Academy Awards, and was the first anime film to win an [[Academy Award|American Academy Award]]</span>
				<span class='text'>iyazaki's films often contain recurrent themes, like humanity's relationship with [[nature]] and technology, and the difficulty of maintaining a [[pacifist]] ethic</span>
				<span class='text'>The protagonists of his films are often strong, independent girls or young women</span>
				<span class='text'>While two of his films, ''[[The Castle of Cagliostro]]'' and ''[[Castle in the Sky]]'', involve traditional [[villain]]s, his other films like ''[[Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (film)|Nausicaä]]'' and ''Princess Mononoke'' present morally ambiguous antagonists with redeeming qualities</span>
				<span class='text'>He co-wrote films ''[[Arrietty|The Secret World of Arrietty]]'', released in July 2010 in Japan and February 2012 in the United States; and ''[[From Up on Poppy Hill]]'' released in July 2011 in Japan and March 2013 in the United States</span>

				<span class='text'>During his May 22, 1988 lecture at the film festival in Nagoya he retold the account of his family's hasty retreat from the burning town, without providing a ride to other people in need of transportation, and he recalled how the fires had coloured the night sky as he looked back towards the city after they had fled to a safer distance</span>

				<span class='text'>Miyazaki graduated from Gakushuin in 1963 with degrees in [[political science]] and [[economics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;HC&quot;/&gt;==Animation career=====Early career and Toei Animation===In April 1963, Miyazaki got a job at [[Toei Animation]], working as an [[Inbetweening|in-between artist]] on the theatrical feature anime ''[[Watchdog Bow Wow]]'' and the TV anime ''Wolf Boy Ken''</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a leader in a labor dispute soon after his arrival, becoming chief secretary of Toei's labor union in 1964</span>
				<span class='text'>{efn|McCarthy (1999), page 30</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;McCarthy(1999)&quot;/&gt;}}  He first gained recognition while working as an in-between artist on the Toei production ''[[Gulliver's Travels Beyond the Moon]]'' in 1965</span>
				<span class='text'>He found the original ending to the script unsatisfactory and pitched his own idea, which became the ending used in the finished film</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1968 Miyazaki played an important role as chief animator, concept artist, and scene designer on ''[[Hols: Prince of the Sun]]'', a landmark animated film</span>
				<span class='text'>Through the collaborative process adopted for the project he was able to contribute his ideas and work closely with his mentor, [[Animation Director]] [[Yasuo Ōtsuka]], whose innovative approach to animation had a profound impact on Miyazaki's work</span>
				<span class='text'>The film was directed by [[Isao Takahata]], with whom he continued to collaborate for the remainder of his career</span>
				<span class='text'>In Kimio Yabuki's ''[[Puss in Boots (1969 film)|Puss in Boots]]'' (1969), Miyazaki again provided key animation as well as designs, storyboards and story ideas for key scenes in the film, including the climactic chase scene</span>
				<span class='text'>He also illustrated the manga, as a promotional [[Tie-in]], for this production of ''Puss in Boots''</span>
				<span class='text'>Toei Animation produced two more sequels with the 'Puss in Boots' from this film, during the 1970s, and the character would ultimately become the studio's mascot, but Miyazaki wasn't involved with any of the sequels</span>
				<span class='text'>Shortly thereafter, Miyazaki proposed scenes in the screenplay for ''[[Flying Phantom Ship]],'' in which military tanks would roll into downtown Tokyo and cause mass hysteria, and was hired to storyboard and animate those scenes</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1971, Miyazaki played a decisive role in developing structure, characters and designs for [[Hiroshi Ikeda (director)|Hiroshi Ikeda]]'s adaptation of ''[[Doubutsu Takarajima|Animal Treasure Island]]'' and the adaptation of ''[[Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves (1971 film)|Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves]]'' by Hiroshi Shidara</span>
				<span class='text'>Miyazaki also helped in the storyboarding and key animating of pivotal scenes in both films and made a promotional manga for ''Animal Treasure Island''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;!--See Manga section below--&gt;Miyazaki left Toei for [[Shin-Ei Animation|A Pro]] in August 1971, where he co-directed 14 episodes of the first ''[[Lupin III]]'' series with Isao Takahata</span>
				<span class='text'>That year the two also began pre-production on a ''[[Pippi Longstocking]]'' series and drew extensive story boards for it</span>
				<span class='text'>However, after traveling to [[Sweden]] to conduct research for the film and meet the original author, [[Astrid Lindgren]], permission was refused to complete the project, and it was canceled as a result</span>
				<span class='text'>{efn|McCarthy (1999), page 39</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;McCarthy(1999)&quot;/&gt;}} In 1972 and 1973 Miyazaki conceived, wrote, designed and animated two ''[[Panda! Go, Panda!]]'' shorts which were directed by Takahata</span>
				<span class='text'>fter their move to [[Zuiyo Eizo]], in 1974, he worked as an animator on the [[World Masterpiece Theater]] with Takahata, which included their adaptation of the first part of [[Johanna Spyri]]'s [[Heidi]] novel into the animated television series ''[[Heidi, Girl of the Alps]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The company continued as Nippon Animation in 1975</span>
				<span class='text'>Miyazaki also directed the television series ''[[Future Boy Conan]]'' (1978), an adaptation of the children's novel ''[[The Incredible Tide]]'' by [[Alexander Key]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The main antagonist is the leader of the [[city-state]] of Industria who attempts to revive lost technology</span>
				<span class='text'>The series also elaborates on the characters and events in the book, and is an early example of characterizations which recur throughout Miyazaki's later work: a girl who is in touch with nature, a warrior woman who appears menacing but is not an antagonist, and a boy who seems destined for the girl</span>
				<span class='text'> The series also featured imaginative aircraft designs</span>
				<span class='text'>==Breakthrough films and ''Spirited Away''===Miyazaki left [[Nippon Animation]] in 1979 in the middle of the production of ''[[Anne of Green Gables (anime)|Anne of Green Gables]]'' and moved to the [[TMS Entertainment]] subsidiary Telecom Animation Film to direct his first feature anime film ''[[The Castle of Cagliostro]]'' (1979), a Lupin III adventure film</span>
				<span class='text'> In 1981, a delegation of TMS animators, including Miyazaki, visited the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney animation studio]] in the United States where they presented a clip from ''The Castle of Cagliostro''</span>
				<span class='text'> That clip deeply moved and strongly influenced a young Disney animator named [[John Lasseter]], who would become one of Miyazaki's biggest fans, and after becoming a successful director at [[Pixar]] would use his own influence to expand awareness of Miyazaki's work among American audiences</span>

				<span class='text'>These episodes were first broadcast on TV in 1984–85</span>
				<span class='text'>In Japan a short film based on the first two episodes had a theatrical release in March 1994</span>
				<span class='text'>iyazaki's next film, ''[[Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (film)|Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind]]'', released on March 11, 1984, is an adaption of his manga series of the [[Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (manga)|same title]]</span>
				<span class='text'>A science fiction adventure in which he introduces many of the recurring themes he would go on to explore throughout his career: a concern with [[ecology]], human interaction with and impact on, the environment; a fascination with aircraft and flight; pacifism, including an anti-military streak; feminism; morally ambiguous characterizations, especially among villains; and love</span>
				<span class='text'>Starring the voices of [[Sumi Shimamoto]], [[Yōji Matsuda]], [[Iemasa Kayumi]], [[Gorō Naya]] and [[Yoshiko Sakakibara]], this was the first film both written and directed by Miyazaki</span>
				<span class='text'>The film and the manga have common roots in ideas Miyazaki mulled over in the early 1980s</span>
				<span class='text'>Serialization of the manga began in the February 1982 issue of [[Tokuma Shoten]]'s [[Animage]] magazine</span>
				<span class='text'>The plot of the film corresponds roughly with the first 16 chapters of the manga</span>
				<span class='text'>Miyazaki continued expanding the story over an additional decade after the release of the film</span>
				<span class='text'>The successful cooperation on the creation of the manga and the film laid the foundation for other collaborative projects</span>

				<span class='text'>Miyazaki's fascination with flight is evident throughout these films, ranging from the [[ornithopter]]s flown by pirates in ''Castle in the Sky,'' to the Totoro and the Cat Bus soaring through the air, and Kiki flying her broom</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1992, Miyazaki directed ''[[Porco Rosso]]'', an adventure film set in the &quot;[[Adriatic]]&quot; during the 1920s</span>
				<span class='text'>The film was a notable departure for Miyazaki, in that the main character was an adult man, an [[Fascism|anti-fascist]] aviator transformed into an [[anthropomorphic]] pig</span>
				<span class='text'>The film is about a titular bounty hunter, voiced by Shūichirō Moriyama, and an American soldier of fortune, voiced by [[Akio Ōtsuka]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The film explores the tension between selfishness and duty</span>

				<span class='text'>Starring the voices of [[Yuriko Ishida]], [[Yōji Matsuda]], [[Akihiro Miwa]] and [[Yūko Tanaka]], the story is about a struggle between the animal spirits inhabiting the forest and the humans exploiting the forest for industry, culminating in an uneasy co-existence and boundary transcending relationships between the main characters</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''Mononoke'' he revisits the ecological and political themes and continues his cinematic exploration of the transience of existence he began in ''Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind</span>
				<span class='text'>' Both films have their roots in ideas and artwork he created in the late 1970s and early 1980s but Helen McCarthy notes that Miyazaki's vision has developed, &quot;from the utopian visions of ''Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind'' to the mature and kindly humanism of ''Princess Mononoke''</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Influences===Among Miyazaki's earliest influences are the illustrated stories he read in boys' magazines and manga ''Tankōbon'' during his childhood</span>
				<span class='text'>He has indicated that he does not only like their subject matter and their presentation of the artwork but also that he came to appreciate the pacing of their adventures, allowing for a thorough immersion in the stories they created because the slow production rate necessitated re-reading the same work several times</span>

				<span class='text'>Miyazaki has identified Soji Yamakawa's ''Shōnen ōja'' as one of the influential stories he read</span>
				<span class='text'>Takekuma has noted that several of Miyazaki's works, in both manga and anime, have their roots in Tetsuji Fukushima's ''The evil Lord of the Desert''</span>

				<span class='text'>n an interview broadcast on [[BBC Choice]] on 2002-06-10, Miyazaki cited the British authors [[Eleanor Farjeon]], [[Rosemary Sutcliff]], and [[Philippa Pearce]] as influences</span>
				<span class='text'>The filmmaker has also publicly expressed fondness for [[Roald Dahl]]'s stories about pilots and airplanes; the image in ''Porco Rosso'' of a cloud of dead pilots was inspired by Dahl's ''They Shall Not Grow Old</span>
				<span class='text'>'  As in Miyazaki's films, these authors create self-contained worlds in which [[allegory]] is often used, and characters have complex, and often ambiguous, motivations</span>
				<span class='text'>Other Miyazaki works, such as ''My Neighbor Totoro,'' ''Princess Mononoke,'' and ''Spirited Away,'' incorporate elements of Japanese history and [[Japanese Myth|mythology]]</span>
				<span class='text'>iyazaki has said he was inspired to become an animator by ''[[The Tale of the White Serpent]]'', considered the first modern anime, in 1958</span>
				<span class='text'> He has also said that ''[[The Snow Queen (1957 film)|The Snow Queen]]'', a Soviet animated film, was one of his earliest inspirations, and that it motivated him to stay in animation production</span>

				<span class='text'>Kurosawa was successful in bringing the Western World's attention to Japanese cinematography with his 1950 film ''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'', ''[[Seven Samurai]]'' in 1954, and ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]'' in 1961</span>
				<span class='text'>Another influence was [[Osamu Tezuka]], a pioneer in new manga styles and techniques</span>
				<span class='text'> Miyazaki said of [[Princess Mononoke]], 'I wish Osamu Tezuka could have watched it'</span>
				<span class='text'>Tezuka and Miyazaki had a somewhat uneasy relationship</span>
				<span class='text'>Miyazaki acknowledges his influence, like the influence of an older brother or predecessor, but the influence may not have been seen as an entirely beneficial one</span>
				<span class='text'>s noted by Helen McCarthy, Miyazaki wrote an essay, after Tezuka's passing in 1989, in which he reflected on the influence Tezuka had on his own career in particular and the development of Anime in Japan in general</span>
				<span class='text'>Miyazaki acknowledges that Tezuka was among the creative artists who inspired him to become a manga author but he writes that he initially reacted indignantly and that he felt humiliated when it was pointed out to him that his style as a draughtsman resembled that of Tezuka</span>
				<span class='text'>nce he realised that the observation about the resemblance was accurate, he destroyed his sketches and decided to return to the study of basic drawing skills in order to start over</span>
				<span class='text'>He notes that he does not share the advice that young manga artists should imitate the work of their predecessors when starting out</span>
				<span class='text'>n his essay he also writes that he became increasingly critical of Tezuka's role in the development of anime in Japan and he criticised, particularly other animators, for the reverential treatment, to the point of worship, given Tezuka</span>
				<span class='text'>In Miyazaki's world view, influence is supposed to drive the medium forward and although Miyazaki markets his own name brand well, he is nevertheless also critical of the godlike status bestowed on him</span>
				<span class='text'>e has indicated that he sees such praise as stifling instead of encouraging the exploration of creativity and the development of a personal style in younger artists</span>
