				<span class='text'>The few paying jobs he had during his lifetime included [[mountain man]] ([[North American fur trade|fur trapper]]), wilderness guide, [[Indian agent]], and American Army officer</span>
				<span class='text'>Carson became a frontier legend in his own lifetime via biographies and news articles</span>
				<span class='text'>Exaggerated versions of his exploits were the subject of [[dime novels]]</span>
				<span class='text'>arson left home in rural present-day [[Missouri]] at age 16 to become a mountain man and [[Animal trapping|trapper]] in the West</span>
				<span class='text'>In the 1830s, he accompanied [[Ewing Young]] on an expedition to Mexican California and joined fur trapping expeditions into the [[Rocky Mountains]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He lived among and married into the [[Arapaho]] and [[Cheyenne]] tribes</span>
				<span class='text'>n the 1840s, he was hired as a guide by [[John C</span>
				<span class='text'>Fremont]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Fremont's expedition covered much of [[California]], [[Oregon]], and the [[Great Basin]] area</span>
				<span class='text'>Fremont mapped and wrote reports and commentaries on the [[Oregon Trail]] to assist and encourage westward-bound [[American pioneers]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Carson achieved national fame through Fremont's accounts of his expeditions</span>
				<span class='text'>nder Fremont's command, Carson participated in the [[Conquest of California|uprising]] against [[Centralist Republic of Mexico|Mexican]] rule in California at the beginning of the [[Mexican-American War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Later in the war, Carson was a scout and courier, celebrated for his rescue mission after the [[Battle of San Pasqual]] and for his coast-to-coast journey from California to [[Washington, DC]] to deliver news of the conflict in California to the U</span>

				<span class='text'>In the 1850s, he was appointed as the [[Indian agent]] to the [[Ute Indians]] and the [[Jicarilla]] Apaches</span>
				<span class='text'>uring the [[American Civil War]], Carson led a regiment of mostly Hispanic volunteers from [[New Mexico]] on the side of the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] at the [[Battle of Valverde]] in 1862</span>
				<span class='text'>When the Confederate threat to New Mexico was eliminated, Carson led forces to suppress the [[Navajo people|Navajo]], [[Mescalero]] Apache, and the [[Kiowa]] and [[Comanche]] Indians</span>
				<span class='text'>arson was [[brevet (military)|breveted]] a [[Brigadier General]], and took command of [[Fort Garland, Colorado]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was there only briefly: poor health forced him to retire from military life</span>
				<span class='text'>Carson was married three times and had ten children</span>
				<span class='text'>The Carson home was in [[Taos, New Mexico]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Carson died at [[Fort Lyon, Colorado]], of an [[aortic aneurysm]] on May 23, 1868</span>
				<span class='text'>He is buried in Taos, New Mexico, next to his third wife Josefa Jaramillo</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|upright=1|Early photograph (possibly the first) of Kit Carson wearing a beaver hat]]Carson was born in [[Kentucky]] on [[Christmas Eve]], 1809</span>
				<span class='text'> His parents were Lindsay (or Lindsey) Carson and his second wife, Rebecca Robinson</span>
				<span class='text'>Lindsay had had five children by his first wife Lucy Bradley, and ten more children by Rebecca</span>
				<span class='text'>Kit was their sixth, making him the eleventh of Lindsay's offspring</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Roberts1&gt;Roberts 54–55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guild and Carter 3&lt;/ref&gt;Lindsay Carson had a Scots-Irish [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] background</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Sides1&gt;Sides 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; He was a farmer, a cabin builder, and a [[veteran]] of the [[American Revolutionary War]] and the [[War of 1812]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Roberts1/&gt; He fought Indians on the American frontier, losing two fingers on his left hand in a battle with the Fox and Sauk Indians</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Sides1/&gt;The Carson family moved to Boone's Lick, [[Howard County, Missouri|Howard County]], [[Missouri]] when Kit was about one year old</span>
				<span class='text'>The family settled on a tract of land owned by the sons of [[Daniel Boone]], who had purchased the land from the Spanish</span>
				<span class='text'>The Boone and Carson families became good friends, working and socializing together, and intermarrying</span>
				<span class='text'>Lindsay's oldest son William married Boone's grand-niece, Millie Boone, in 1810</span>
				<span class='text'>Their daughter Adaline became Kit's favorite playmate</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Guild and Carter 9&lt;/ref&gt;Missouri was then the frontier of American expansionism west; cabins were &quot;forted&quot; with tall stockade fences to defend against Indian attacks</span>
				<span class='text'>As men worked in the fields, sentries were posted with weapons, to protect the farmers</span>
				<span class='text'>These men were ready to kill any Indian who attacked</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Roberts1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sides1/&gt; Carson wrote in his ''Memoirs'': &quot;For two or three years after our arrival, we had to remain forted and it was necessary to have men stationed at the extremities of the fields for the protection of those that were laboring</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=Roberts1/&gt;In 1818 Lindsay Carson died instantly when a tree limb fell on him while clearing a field</span>
				<span class='text'>Kit was about 8 years old</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite being penniless, his mother took care of her children alone for four years</span>
				<span class='text'>She then married Joseph Martin, a widower with several children</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Guild and Carter 10&lt;/ref&gt; Kit was a young teenager at the time and did not get along with his stepfather</span>
				<span class='text'>The decision was made to apprentice him to [[David Workman]], a saddler in [[Franklin, Missouri]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Kit wrote in his ''Memoirs'' that Workman was &quot;a good man, and I often recall the kind treatment I received</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Guild and Carter 15&lt;/ref&gt;Franklin was situated at the eastern end of the [[Santa Fe Trail]], which had opened two years earlier</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of the customers at the saddleshop were trappers and traders, from whom Carson heard stirring tales of the West</span>
				<span class='text'>Carson found work in the saddlery not to his taste: he once stated &quot;the business did not suit me, and I concluded to leave&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Carter 38–39&lt;/ref&gt;=== Santa Fe Trail ===In August 1826, against his mother's wishes, Kit ran away from his apprenticeship</span>
				<span class='text'>He went west with a caravan of fur trappers, tending their livestock</span>
				<span class='text'>They made their trek over the Santa Fe Trail to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], the capital of [[Santa Fe de Nuevo México]], reaching their destination in November 1826</span>
				<span class='text'>Kit settled in [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Guild and Carter 27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Roberts2&gt;Roberts 56–57&lt;/ref&gt;Carson lived with Mathew Kinkead, a trapper and explorer who had served with Carson's older brothers during the War of 1812</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Carter2&gt;Carter 42–50</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Carson was mentored by Kinkead in learning the skills of a trapper, while learning the necessary languages for trade</span>
				<span class='text'>Eventually he became fluent in Spanish and several Indian languages</span>
				<span class='text'>orkman put an advertisement in a local newspaper back in Missouri</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote that he would give a one cent [[Bounty (reward)|reward]] to anyone who brought the boy back to Franklin</span>
				<span class='text'>No one claimed the reward</span>
				<span class='text'>It was a bit of a joke, but Carson was free</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Roberts2/&gt; The advertisement featured the first printed description of Carson: &quot;Christopher Carson, a boy about 16 years old, small of his age, but thick set; light hair, ran away from the subscriber, living in Franklin, Howard county, Missouri, to whom he had been bound to learn the saddler's trade</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=Roberts2/&gt;Between 1827 and 1829, Carson worked as cook, translator, and wagon driver in the southwest</span>
				<span class='text'>He also worked at a copper mine near the [[Gila River]] in southwestern [[New Mexico]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Sides 14&lt;/ref&gt; In later life, Carson never mentioned any women from his youth</span>
				<span class='text'>There are only three specific women mentioned in his writing: Josefa Jaramillo, his third and last wife; a comrade's mother in [[Washington, DC]]; and Mrs</span>
				<span class='text'>Ann White, a victim of Indian atrocities</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Guild and Carter 26&lt;/ref&gt;== Mountain man (1829–1841) =={{See also|Fur trade}}[[File:Carson and his horse Apache</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright=1|Mountain man Kit Carson and his favorite horse, Apache, from ''The Life and Adventures of Kit Carson, the Nestor of the Rocky Mountains'' by De Witt C</span>
				<span class='text'>Peters</span>
				<span class='text'>The book was Carson's first biography, and was printed in 1858</span>
				<span class='text'>]At the age of nineteen, Carson began his career as a mountain man</span>
				<span class='text'>He traveled through many parts of the American West with famous [[mountain men]] like [[Jim Bridger]] and [[Old Bill Williams]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He spent the winter of 1828–1829 as a cook for [[Ewing Young]] in Taos</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Guild and Carter 32&lt;/ref&gt; He joined Young's trapping expedition of 1829</span>
				<span class='text'>The leadership of Young and the experience of the venture are credited with shaping Carson's early life in the mountains</span>
				<span class='text'>uring August 1829 the party went into [[Apache]] country along the [[Gila River]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The expedition was attacked, being Carson's first experience of combat</span>
				<span class='text'>Young's party continued on into [[Alta California]] trapping and trading in California from [[Sacramento]] in the north to [[Los Angeles]] in the south, returning to Taos, New Mexico in April 1830 after trapping along the [[Colorado River]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Carter 42–50&lt;/ref&gt;Carson joined a wagon train rescue party after entering Taos, and although the perpetrators had fled the scene of atrocities Young had the opportunity to witness Carson's horsemanship and courage</span>
				<span class='text'>Carson joined another expedition led by Thomas Fitzpatrick and William Levin in 1831</span>
				<span class='text'> Fitzpatrick, Levin and his trappers went north to the central [[Rocky Mountains]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Carson would hunt and trap in the West for about ten years</span>
				<span class='text'>He was known as a reliable man and a good fighter</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Guild and Carter 48&lt;/ref&gt;Life for Carson as a mountain man was not easy</span>
				<span class='text'>After collecting beavers from traps, he had to hold onto them for months at a time until the annual [[Rocky Mountain Rendezvous]],&lt;ref&gt;Sides 15&lt;/ref&gt; held in remote areas of the West like the banks of the Green River in [[Wyoming]]</span>
				<span class='text'>With the money received for the pelts, necessities of an independent life including [[fish hook]]s, [[flour]] and [[tobacco]] were procured</span>
				<span class='text'>As there was little to no medical access in the varied regions he worked in, Carson had to dress his wounds and nurse himself</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cleland 44&lt;/ref&gt; Conflict with particular Indians sometimes occurred</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cleland 40–41&lt;/ref&gt; Carson's primary clothing at the time was in deer skins that had stiffened after being left outdoors for a time</span>
				<span class='text'>This suit offered some protection against particular weapons employed by Indians</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cleland 21&lt;/ref&gt;[[Grizzly bear]]s were one of the mountain man's greatest enemies</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cleland 43&lt;/ref&gt; A particular incident involving the animals happened to Carson in 1834 as he was hunting an elk alone</span>
				<span class='text'>Two bears crossed paths with him and quickly chased him up a tree</span>
				<span class='text'>One of the bears tried to make him fall by shaking the tree, but was not successful and eventually went away</span>
				<span class='text'>Carson returned to his camp as fast as he could</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote in his ''Memoirs'' that: &quot;[The bear] finally concluded to leave, of which I was heartily pleased, never having been so scared in my life</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Roberts 80&quot;&gt;Roberts 80&lt;/ref&gt;The last rendezvous was held in 1840</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Sides 33–34&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the fur trade began to drop off</span>
				<span class='text'>Fashionable men in [[London]], [[Paris]], and [[New York City|New York]] wanted [[silk]] hats instead of beaver hats</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, beaver populations across [[North America]] were declining rapidly from over-exploitation</span>
				<span class='text'>Carson knew it was time to find other work</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote in his ''Memoirs'' that &quot;Beaver was getting scarce, it became necessary to try our hand at something else</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;In 1841, he was hired at [[Bent's Fort]] in [[Colorado]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This fort was one of the greatest buildings in the West</span>
				<span class='text'>Hundreds of people worked or lived there</span>
				<span class='text'>Carson hunted buffalo, antelope, deer, and other animals to feed these people</span>
				<span class='text'>He was paid one dollar a day</span>
				<span class='text'>He returned to Bent's Fort several times during his life to again provide meat for the fort's residents</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Roberts 99-101&quot;&gt;Roberts 99–101&lt;/ref&gt;== Indian fighter ==Carson was nineteen when he set off with Ewing Young's expedition to the Rocky Mountains in 1829</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition to furs and the company of free-spirited, rugged mountain men, Carson sought action and adventure</span>
				<span class='text'>He found what he was looking for in killing and [[scalping]] Indians</span>
				<span class='text'>Carson probably killed and took the scalp of his first Indian when he was nineteen years old, during Ewing Young's expedition</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Sides 16&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:Jim Bridger</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|Jim Bridger]]Carson's ''Memoirs'' are replete with stories about hostile Indian encounters with the memoirist</span>
				<span class='text'>In January 1833, for example, warriors of the Crow tribe stole nine horses from Carson's camp</span>
				<span class='text'>Carson and two other men sprayed the Crow camp with gunfire, killing almost every Crow</span>
				<span class='text'>Carson wrote in his ''Memoirs'': &quot;During our pursuit for the lost animals, we suffered considerably but, the success of having recovered our horses and sending many a redskin to his long home, our sufferings were soon forgotten</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 82&lt;/ref&gt;The Blackfoot nation was a hostile tribe, and posed the greatest threat to Carson's livelihood, safety, and life</span>
				<span class='text'>He hated the Blackfeet, and killed them at every opportunity</span>
				<span class='text'>Historian David Roberts has written: &quot;It was taken for granted that the Blackfeet were bad Indians; to shoot them whenever he could was a mountain man's instinct and duty</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 85&lt;/ref&gt;Carson had several encounters with the Blackfeet</span>
				<span class='text'>His last battle with the Blackfeet took place in spring 1838</span>
				<span class='text'>He was traveling with about one hundred mountain men led by [[Jim Bridger]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In Montana territory, the group found a teepee with three Indian corpses inside</span>
				<span class='text'>These three had died of [[smallpox]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Bridger wanted to move on, but Carson and the other young men wanted to kill the Blackfeet</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Roberts 87-88&quot;&gt;Roberts 87–88&lt;/ref&gt; They found the Blackfoot village, and killed ten Blackfeet warriors</span>
				<span class='text'>The Blackfeet found some safety in a pile of rocks, but were driven away</span>
				<span class='text'>It is not known how many Blackfeet died in this incident</span>
				<span class='text'>Historian David Roberts writes: &quot;[I]f anything like pity filled Carson's breast as, in his twenty-ninth year, he beheld the ravaged camp of the Blackfeet, he did not bother to remember it</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Carson wrote in his ''Memoirs'' that this battle was &quot;the prettiest fight I ever saw</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Roberts 87-88&quot;/&gt;Carson's notions about Indians softened over the years</span>
				<span class='text'>He found himself more and more in their company as he grew older</span>
				<span class='text'>His notions about Indians became more understanding and more humane</span>
				<span class='text'>He urged the government to set aside lands called reservations for their use</span>
				<span class='text'>As an Indian agent, he saw to it that those under his watch were treated with honesty, fairness, and clothed and fed properly</span>
				<span class='text'>Historian David Roberts believes his first marriage to an Arapaho woman named Singing Grass &quot;softened the stern and pragmatic mountaineer's opportunism</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright=1</span>
				<span class='text'>|left|[[John Charles Frémont]], the photographer and date are unknown</span>
				<span class='text'>]In April 1842, Carson went back to his childhood home in Missouri to put his daughter Adaline in the care of relatives</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Roberts 99-101&quot;/&gt; On the return trip, Carson met [[John C</span>
				<span class='text'>Frémont]] aboard a steamboat on the [[Missouri River]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Frémont was a United States Army officer in the [[Corps of Topographical Engineers]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was about to lead an expedition into the West</span>
				<span class='text'>After a brief conversation, Frémont hired Carson as a guide at $100 a month</span>
				<span class='text'>It was the best-paying job of Carson's life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Roberts 123&lt;/ref&gt; Frémont wrote, &quot;I was pleased with him and his manner of address at this first meeting</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a man of medium height, broad-shouldered, and deep-chested, with a clear steady blue eye and frank speech and address; quiet and unassuming</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 102–103&lt;/ref&gt;=== First expedition, 1842 ===In 1842, Carson guided Frémont across the [[Oregon Trail]] to [[South Pass, Wyoming]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This was their first expedition into the West together</span>
				<span class='text'>The purpose of this expedition was to map and describe the Oregon Trail as far as South Pass</span>
				<span class='text'>A guidebook, maps, and other paraphernalia would be printed for westward-bound migrants and settlers</span>
				<span class='text'>After the five-month, trouble-free mission was accomplished, Frémont wrote his government reports</span>
				<span class='text'>These reports made Carson's name known across the United States, and spurred a migration of settlers westward to Oregon via the Oregon Trail</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Sides 50–53&lt;/ref&gt;=== Second expedition, 1843 ===In 1843, Frémont asked Carson to join his second expedition</span>
				<span class='text'>Carson did</span>
				<span class='text'>He guided Frémont across part of the Oregon Trail to the [[Columbia River]] in Oregon</span>
				<span class='text'>The purpose of the expedition was to map and describe the Oregon Trail from South Pass, Wyoming to the Columbia River</span>
				<span class='text'>They also side-tripped to [[Great Salt Lake]] in [[Utah]], using rubber rafts to navigate the waters</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Roberts 130&lt;/ref&gt; On the way to California, the party suffered from bad weather in the [[Sierra Nevada (U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>|Sierra Nevada Mountains]], but were saved by Carson's good judgement and his skills as a guide</span>
				<span class='text'>They found American settlers who fed them</span>
				<span class='text'>The expedition then headed to California</span>
				<span class='text'>This was illegal and dangerous because California was Mexican territory</span>
				<span class='text'>The Mexican government ordered Frémont to leave</span>
				<span class='text'>Frémont finally went back to Washington, DC</span>
				<span class='text'> The government liked his reports, but ignored his illegal trip into Mexico</span>
				<span class='text'>Frémont was made a captain</span>
				<span class='text'>The newspapers nicknamed him &quot;The Pathfinder&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Sides 59–61&lt;/ref&gt;During this expedition, Frémont trekked into the [[Mojave Desert]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His party met a Mexican man and boy</span>
				<span class='text'>The two told Carson that Native Americans had [[ambush]]ed their party of travelers</span>
				<span class='text'>The male travelers were killed; the women travelers were staked to the ground, sexually mutilated, and killed</span>
				<span class='text'>The murderers then stole the Mexicans' thirty horses</span>
				<span class='text'>Carson and a mountain man friend named [[Alexis Godey]] went after the murderers</span>
				<span class='text'>They took two days to find them</span>
				<span class='text'>They rushed into their camp, killing and scalping two of the murderers</span>
				<span class='text'>The stolen horses were recovered and returned to the Mexican man and boy</span>
				<span class='text'>This selfless, disinterested, generous deed brought Carson even greater fame</span>
				<span class='text'>It confirmed his [[Social status|status]] as a western hero in the eyes of the American people</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Sides 62–64&lt;/ref&gt;=== Third expedition, 1845 ==={{Refimprove section|date=April 2015}}In 1845, Carson guided Frémont on their third and last expedition</span>
				<span class='text'>They went to California and Oregon</span>
				<span class='text'>Frémont made scientific plans, but the expedition appeared to be political in nature</span>
				<span class='text'>Frémont may have been working under secret government orders</span>
				<span class='text'>President Polk wanted the province of Alta California for the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>Once in California, Frémont started to rouse the American settlers into a patriotic fever</span>
				<span class='text'>The Mexican government ordered him to leave</span>
				<span class='text'>Frémont went north to Oregon</span>
				<span class='text'>He camped near [[Klamath Lake]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Messages from Washington, DC made it clear that President Polk wanted California</span>
				<span class='text'>t Klamath Lake in southern Oregon, Frémont's party was attacked by about twenty Indians on the night of March 6, 1846</span>
				<span class='text'>Historians{{who|date=November 2015}} agree that these were most likely Modoc men</span>

				<span class='text'>Historian Edwin Sabin writes that this officer had a &quot;psychopathic hatred of the Apaches&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Roberts 255&lt;/ref&gt; Carleton led his forces deep into the Mescalero Apache territory</span>
				<span class='text'>The Mescaleros were tired of fighting, and put themselves under Carson's protection</span>
				<span class='text'>Carleton put these Apaches on a remote and lonely reservation on the Pecos River</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Roberts 257&lt;/ref&gt;Carson disliked the Apaches</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright=1</span>
				<span class='text'>|left|The Navajo at Fort Sumner, the end of The Long Walk]]Carleton had chosen a bleak site on the Pecos River for his reservation</span>
				<span class='text'>This reservation was called Bosque Redondo (Round Grove)</span>
				<span class='text'>He chose this site for the Apaches and Navajos because it was far from white settlements</span>
				<span class='text'>He also wanted these Apaches and Navajo to act as a buffer for any aggressive acts committed upon the white settlements from Kiowas and Comanches to the east of Bosque Redondo</span>
				<span class='text'>He thought as well that the remoteness and desolation of the reservation would discourage white settlement</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Roberts 259&lt;/ref&gt;The Mescalero Apaches walked {{convert|130|mi}} to the reservation</span>
				<span class='text'>By March 1863, four hundred Apaches had settled around nearby Fort Sumner</span>
				<span class='text'>Others had fled west to join fugitive bands of Apaches</span>
				<span class='text'>By middle summer, many of these people were planting crops and doing other farm work</span>
				<span class='text'>n July 7, Carson, with little heart for the Navajo roundup, started the campaign against the tribe</span>
				<span class='text'>His orders were almost the same as those for the Apache roundup: he was to shoot all males on sight, and take the women and children captives</span>
				<span class='text'>No peace treaties were to be made until all the Navajo were on the reservation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Roberts 260&lt;/ref&gt;Carson searched far and wide for the Navajo</span>
				<span class='text'>He found their homes, fields, animals, and orchards, but the Navajo were experts at disappearing quickly and hiding in their vast lands</span>
				<span class='text'>The roundup proved frustrating for Carson</span>
				<span class='text'>He was in his 50s, tired, and ill</span>
				<span class='text'>By autumn 1863, Carson started to burn the Navajo homes and fields, and remove their animals from the area</span>
				<span class='text'>The Navaho would starve if this destruction continued</span>
				<span class='text'>One hundred eighty-eight Navajo surrendered</span>
				<span class='text'>They were sent to Bosque Redondo</span>
				<span class='text'>Life at the Bosque had turned grim</span>
				<span class='text'>Murders occurred</span>
				<span class='text'>The Apaches and Navajos fought</span>
				<span class='text'>The water in the Pecos contained minerals that gave people cramps and stomach aches</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Roberts 262&lt;/ref&gt;=== Canyon de Chelly ===Carson wanted to take a winter break from the campaign</span>
				<span class='text'>Major Carleton refused</span>
				<span class='text'>Kit was ordered to invade the [[Canyon de Chelly]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It was here that many Navajos had taken refuge</span>
				<span class='text'>Historian David Roberts writes, &quot;Carson's sweep through the Canyon de Chelly in the winter of 1863–1864 would prove to be the decisive action in the Campaign</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 263&lt;/ref&gt;The Canyon de Chelly was a sacred place for the Navajo</span>
				<span class='text'>They believed that it would now be their strongest sanctuary</span>
				<span class='text'>Three hundred Navajo took refuge on the canyon rim at a place called [[Fortress Rock]]</span>
				<span class='text'>They resisted Carson's invasion by building rope ladders and bridges, lowering water pots into a stream, and keeping quiet and out of sight</span>
				<span class='text'>These three hundred Navajo survived the invasion</span>
				<span class='text'>In January 1864, Carson swept through the {{convert|35|mi|adj=on}} Canyon with his forces</span>
				<span class='text'>The thousands of peach trees in the canyon were cut down</span>
				<span class='text'>Few Navajo were killed or captured</span>
				<span class='text'>Carson's invasion, however, proved to the Navajo that the white man could invade their country at any time</span>
				<span class='text'>Many Navajo surrendered at [[Fort Canby]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Roberts 265–269&lt;/ref&gt;By March 1864, there were 3,000 refugees at Fort Canby</span>
				<span class='text'>An additional 5,000 arrived in the camp</span>
				<span class='text'>They were suffering from the intense cold and hunger</span>
				<span class='text'>Carson asked for supplies to feed and clothe them</span>
				<span class='text'>The thousands of Navajo were led to [[Bosque Redondo]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Many died along the way</span>
				<span class='text'>Stragglers in the rear were shot and killed</span>
				<span class='text'>In Navajo history, this horrific trek is known as [[Long Walk of the Navajo]]</span>
				<span class='text'>By 1866, reports indicated that Bosque Redondo was a complete failure</span>
				<span class='text'>Major Carleton was fired</span>
				<span class='text'>Congress started investigations</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1868, a treaty was signed, and the Navajo were allowed to return to their homeland</span>
				<span class='text'>Bosque Redondo was closed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Roberts 270–281&lt;/ref&gt;=== First Battle of Adobe Walls ===On November 25, 1864, Carson led his forces against the southwestern tribes at the [[First Battle of Adobe Walls]] in the [[Texas]] panhandle</span>
				<span class='text'>Adobe Walls was an abandoned trading post blown up by its inhabitants to prevent a take-over by hostile Indians</span>
				<span class='text'>Combatants at the First Battle were the United States Army and Indian scouts against Kiowas, Comanches, and Plains Apaches</span>
				<span class='text'>It was one of the largest engagements fought on the [[Great Plains]]</span>
				<span class='text'>he battle was the result of General Carleton's belief that Indians were responsible for the continuing attacks on settlers along the Santa Fe Trail</span>
				<span class='text'>He wanted to punish them and brought in Carson to do the job</span>
				<span class='text'>With most of the Army engaged elsewhere during the American Civil War, the protection the settlers sought was almost nonexistent</span>
				<span class='text'>Carson led 260 cavalry, 75 infantry, and 72 Ute and Jicarilla Apache Army scouts</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, he had two mountain howitzer cannons</span>

				<span class='text'>The number would swell to possibly 3,000</span>

				<span class='text'>In Denver, a statue of a mounted Kit Carson can be found atop the Mac Monnies Pioneer Monument</span>
				<span class='text'>Another equestrian statue can be seen in Trindad</span>
				<span class='text'>A national forest in New Mexico was named for Carson as well as a county in Colorado</span>

				<span class='text'>Earlier accounts portrayed Carson as an American hero, but in scholarship of this period he became an arch-villain in the military campaigns against the Indians</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1992, for example, a young professor at [[Colorado College]] was successful in demanding that a period photograph of Carson be removed from the [[ROTC]] office</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1992, a tourist told a journalist at the Carson home in Taos, &quot;I will not go into the home of that racist, genocidal killer</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; In the 1970s, a Navajo at a trading post said, &quot;No one here will talk about Kit Carson</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a butcher</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; In 1993, a symposium was organized to air various views on Carson, but the Navajo spokespeople refused to attend</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Roberts 292–295&lt;/ref&gt;Over time, historical analysis of Carson shifted again</span>
				<span class='text'>David Roberts writes, &quot;Carson's trajectory, over three and a half decades, from thoughtless killer of Apaches and Blackfeet to defender and champion of the Utes, marks him out as one of the few frontiersmen whose change of heart toward the Indians, born not of missionary theory but of first hand experience, can serve as an exemplar for the more enlightened policies that sporadically gained the day in the twentieth century</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Carson on a visit to Washington, DC in early 1868]]Carson's contributions to western history have been reexamined by historians, journalists and Indian activists since the 1960s</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1968, Carson biographer Harvey L</span>
				<span class='text'>Carter stated:{{quote|In respect to his actual exploits and his actual character, however, Carson was not overrated</span>
				<span class='text'>If history has to single out one person from among the Mountain Men to receive the admiration of later generations, Carson is the best choice</span>
				<span class='text'>He had far more of the good qualities and fewer of the bad qualities than anyone else in that varied lot of individuals</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Carter 210&lt;/ref&gt;}}Some journalists and authors during the last 25 years presented an alternative view of Kit Carson</span>
				<span class='text'>For instance, Virginia Hopkins stated in 1988 that &quot;Kit Carson was directly or indirectly responsible for the deaths of thousands of Indians&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hopkins 40&lt;/ref&gt;Sides said that Carson believed the Native Americans needed reservations as a way of physically separating and shielding them from white hostility and white culture</span>
				<span class='text'>He is said to have viewed the raids on white settlements as driven by desperation, &quot;committed from absolute necessity when in a starving condition</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Indian hunting grounds were disappearing as waves of white settlers filled the region</span>
