				<span class='text'> This was not however the point at which Alfred came to be known as King of England in fact he would never adopt the title for himself</span>

				<span class='text'>fter another lull in the autumn of 892 or 893 the Danes attacked again</span>

				<span class='text'>52–53  blockquoteWessexs history of failures preceding his success in 878 emphasised to Alfred that the traditional system of battle he had inherited played to the Danes advantage</span>
				<span class='text'>While both the Anglo Saxons and the Danes attacked settlements to seize wealth and other resources they employed very different strategies</span>
				<span class='text'>In their raids the Anglo Saxons traditionally perred to attack head on by assembling their forces in a  advancing against their target and overcoming the oncoming wall marshaled against them in defence</span>
				<span class='text'>name Abels 1998 pages 194–5 In contrast the Danes perred to choose easy targets mapping cautious forays designed to avoid risking all their accumulated plunder with high stake attacks for more</span>
				<span class='text'>Alfred determined their strategy was to launch smaller scaled attacks from a secure and reinforced defensible base to which they could retreat should their raiders meet strong resistance</span>
				<span class='text'>name Abels 1998 pages 194–5  These bases were prepared in advance often by capturing an estate and augmenting its defences with surrounding ditches  and s</span>
				<span class='text'>Once inside the fortification Alfred realised the Danes enjoyed the advantage better situated to outlast their opponents or crush them with a counter attack as the provisions and stamina of the besieging forces waned</span>
				<span class='text'>name Abels 1998 pages 194–5 The means by which the Anglo Saxons marshaled forces to defend against marauders also left them vulnerable to the Vikings</span>
				<span class='text'>It was the responsibility of the shire fyrd to deal with local raids</span>
				<span class='text'>The king could call up the national militia to defend the kingdom however in the case of hit and run raids by Vikings problems with communication and raising supplies meant that the national militia could not be mustered quickly enough It was only after the raids were underway that a call went out to landowners to gather men for battle</span>
				<span class='text'>Large regions could be devastated before the newly assembled fyrd arrived</span>
				<span class='text'>And although the landowners were obliged to the king to supply these men when called during the attacks in 878 many of them opportunistically abandoned their king and collaborated with Guthrum</span>
				<span class='text'> name cannon398 With these lessons in mind Alfred capitalised on the relatively peaceful years immediately following his victory at Edington by focusing on an ambitious restructuring of his kingdoms military defences</span>
				<span class='text'>On a trip to Rome Alfred had stayed with  and it is possible that he may have studied how the Carolingian kings had dealt with the Viking problem and learning from their experience was able to put together a system of taxation and defence for his own kingdom</span>
				<span class='text'>Also there had been a system of fortifications in pre Viking Mercia that may have been an influence</span>
				<span class='text'>So when the Viking raids resumed in 892 Alfred was better prepared to confront them with a standing mobile field army a network of garrisons and a small fleet of ships navigating the rivers and estuaries</span>
				<span class='text'> name keynes14  name lavelle212 Tenants in Anglo Saxon England had a threefold obligation based on their landholding the so called common burdens of military service fortress work and bridge repair</span>
				<span class='text'>This threefold obligation has traditionally been called trinoda neccessitas or trimoda neccessitas</span>
				<span class='text'>name lavelle70   The Old English name for the fine due for neglecting military service was  fierdwite or fyrdwitee name attenborough52  To maintain the s and to reorganize the fyrd as a standing army Alfred expanded the tax and conscription system based on the productivity of a tenants landholding</span>
				<span class='text'>The hide was the basic unit of the system on which the tenants public obligations were assessed</span>
				<span class='text'>A hide is thought to represent the amount of land required to support one family</span>
				<span class='text'>The hide would differ in size according to the value and resources of the land and the landowner would have to provide service based on how many hides he owned</span>
				<span class='text'>name lavelle70   name lapidge238 At the centre of Alfreds ormed military defence system was the network of s distributed at strategic points throughout the kingdom</span>
				<span class='text'> There were thirty three in total spaced approximately  apart enabling the military to confront attacks anywhere in the kingdom within a single day</span>
				<span class='text'> Alfreds burhs later termed  ranged from former Roman towns such as Winchester where the stone walls were repaired and ditches added to massive earthen walls surrounded by wide ditches probably reinforced with wooden s and palisades such as at Burpham Sussex</span>

				<span class='text'>name rumble5   A total of 27071 soldiers were needed system wide or approximately one in four of all the free men in Wessex</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of the burhs were twin towns that straddled a river and connected by a fortified bridge like those built by  a generation before</span>
				<span class='text'>name keynes14  The double burh blocked passage on the river forcing Viking ships to navigate under a garrisoned bridge lined with men armed with stones spears or arrows</span>
				<span class='text'>Other burhs were sited near fortified royal villas allowing the king better control over his strongholds</span>
				<span class='text'>This network of well garrisoned burhs posed significant obstacles to Viking invaders especially those laden with booty</span>
				<span class='text'>The system threatened Viking routes and communications making it far more dangerous for the Viking raiders</span>
				<span class='text'>However the Vikings lacked both the equipment necessary to undertake a siege against the burh and a developed doctrine of  having tailored their methods of fighting to rapid strikes and unimpeded retreats to well defended fortifications</span>
				<span class='text'>The only means left to them was to starve the burh into submission but this allowed the king time to send assistance with his mobile field army or garrisons from neighbouring burhs</span>
				<span class='text'>In such cases the Vikings were extremely vulnerable to pursuit by the kings joint military forces</span>
				<span class='text'>  Alfreds burh system posed such a formidable challenge against Viking attack that when the Vikings returned in 892 and successfully stormed a half made poorly garrisoned fortress up the Lympne estuary in  the Anglo Saxons were able to limit their penetration to the outer frontiers of Wessex and Mercia</span>
				<span class='text'>Alfreds burghal system was revolutionary in its strategic conception and potentially expensive in its execution</span>

				<span class='text'>But clearly the author of the Anglo Saxon Chronicle and probably Alfred himself regarded 897 as marking an important development in the naval power of Wessex</span>
				<span class='text'>The chronicler flattered his royal patron by boasting that Alfreds ships were not only larger but swifter steadier and rode higher in the water than either Danish or Frisian ships</span>

				<span class='text'>It has been suggested that like sea battles in late Viking age Scandinavia these battles may have entailed a ship coming alongside an enemy vessel at which point the crew would lash the two ships together before boarding the enemy craft</span>

				<span class='text'>2–93  Together these laws are arranged into 120 chapters</span>
				<span class='text'>In his introduction Alfred explains that he gathered together the laws he found in many  books and ordered to be written many of the ones that our foathers observed—those that pleased me and many of the ones that did not please me I rejected with the advice of my councillors and commanded them to be observed in a different way</span>

				<span class='text'>Alfred singled out in particular the laws that he found in the days of Ine my kinsman or  king of the Mercians or King  who first among the English people received baptism</span>
				<span class='text'>He appended rather than integrated the laws of Ine into his code and although he included as had Æthelbert a scale of payments in compensation for injuries to various body parts the two injury tariffs are not aligned</span>
				<span class='text'>Offa is not known to have issued a law code leading historian  to speculate that Alfred had in mind the legatine capitulary of 786 that was presented to Offa by two papal legates</span>
				<span class='text'>About a fifth of the law code is taken up by Alfreds introduction which includes translations into English of the  a few chapters from the  and the Apostolic Letter from  1523–29</span>
				<span class='text'>The Introduction may best be understood as Alfreds meditation upon the meaning of Christian law</span>
				<span class='text'>p</span>
				<span class='text'>215</span>
				<span class='text'> It traces the continuity between Gods gift of Law to Moses to Alfreds own issuance of law to the West Saxon people</span>
				<span class='text'>By doing so it links the holy past to the historical present and represents Alfreds law giving as a type of divine legislation</span>
				<span class='text'>his is the reason that Alfred divided his code into precisely 120 chapters 120 was the age at which Moses died and in the number symbolism of early medieval biblical exegetes 120 stood for law</span>
				<span class='text'> The link between the Mosaic Law and Alfreds code is the Apostolic Letter which explained that Christ had come not to shatter or annul the commandments but to fulfill them and he taught mercy and meekness Intro 49</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>The mercy that Christ infused into Mosaic Law underlies the injury tariffs that figure so prominently in barbarian law codes since Christian synods established through that mercy which Christ taught that for almost every misdeed at the first offence secular lords might with their permission receive without sin the monetary compensation which they then fixed</span>

				<span class='text'>The impression one receives is of a hodgepodge of miscellaneous laws</span>
				<span class='text'>The law code as it has been preserved is singularly unsuitable for use in lawsuits</span>
				<span class='text'>In fact several of Alfreds laws contradict  that form an integral part of the code</span>
				<span class='text'>Patrick Wormalds explanation is that Alfreds law code should be understood not as a legal manual but as an ideological manifesto of kingship designed more for symbolic impact than for practical direction</span>
				<span class='text'> In practical terms the most important law in the code may well be the very first We enjoin what is most necessary that each man keep caully his oath and his pledge which expresses a fundamental tenet of Anglo Saxon law</span>

				<span class='text'>Alfred devoted considerable attention and thought to judicial matters</span>
				<span class='text'>Asser underscores his concern for judicial fairness</span>
