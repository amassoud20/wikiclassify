				<span class='text'>6–17&lt;/ref&gt; It was with the backdrop of a rampaging Viking army that Alfred's public life began, with the accession of his third brother, [[Æthelred of Wessex]], in 865</span>
				<span class='text'>t is during this period that Bishop Asser applied to Alfred the unique title of &quot;secundarius&quot;, which may indicate a position akin to that of the [[Celt]]ic ''[[Tanistry|tanist]]'', a recognised successor closely associated with the reigning monarch</span>
				<span class='text'>It is possible that this arrangement was sanctioned by Alfred's father, or by the [[Witenagemot|Witan]], to guard against the danger of a disputed succession should Æthelred fall in battle</span>
				<span class='text'>The arrangement of crowning a successor as royal prince and military commander is well known among other [[Germanic monarchy|Germanic]] [[Germanic peoples|tribes]], such as the [[Swedish people|Swedes]] and [[Franks]], to whom the Anglo-Saxons were closely related</span>
				<span class='text'>== Fighting the Viking invasion ===In 868, Alfred is recorded as fighting beside Æthelred in an unsuccessful attempt to keep the Great Heathen Army led by [[Ivar the Boneless ]] out of the adjoining [[Kingdom of Mercia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=aschron/&gt; At the end of 870, the Danes arrived in his homeland</span>
				<span class='text'>The year which followed has been called &quot;Alfred's year of battles&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Nine engagements were fought with varying outcomes, though the place and date of two of these battles have not been recorded</span>
				<span class='text'>n Berkshire, a successful skirmish at the [[Battle of Englefield]] on 31 December 870 was followed by a severe defeat at the [[Battle of Reading (871)|siege and Battle of Reading]] by Ivar's brother [[Halfdan Ragnarsson]] on 5 January 871</span>
				<span class='text'>Four days later, the Anglo-Saxons won a brilliant victory at the [[Battle of Ashdown]] on the [[North Wessex Downs AONB|Berkshire Downs]], possibly near [[Compton, Berkshire|Compton]] or [[Aldworth]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Alfred is particularly credited with the success of this latter battle</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Plummer|1911}}Later that month, on 22 January, the Saxons were defeated at the [[Battle of Basing]]</span>
				<span class='text'>They were defeated again on 22 March at the [[Battle of Merton]] (perhaps Marden in [[Wiltshire]] or Martin in [[Dorset]])</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Plummer|1911}} Æthelred died shortly afterwards on 23 April</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|Alfred the Great plots the capture of the Danish fleet</span>
				<span class='text'>]In April 871, King Æthelred died, and Alfred succeeded to the throne of Wessex and the burden of its defence, despite the fact that Æthelred left two under-age sons, [[Æthelhelm]] and [[Æthelwold of Wessex|Æthelwold]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This was in accordance with the agreement that Æthelred and Alfred had made earlier that year in an assembly at ''Swinbeorg''</span>
				<span class='text'>The brothers had agreed that whichever of them outlived the other would inherit the personal property that King Æthelwulf had left jointly to his sons in his will</span>
				<span class='text'>The deceased's sons would receive only whatever property and riches their father had settled upon them and whatever additional lands their uncle had acquired</span>
				<span class='text'>The unstated premise was that the surviving brother would be king</span>
				<span class='text'>Given the ongoing Danish invasion and the youth of his nephews, Alfred's accession probably went uncontested</span>
				<span class='text'>hile he was busy with the burial ceremonies for his brother, the Danes defeated the Saxon army in his absence at an unnamed spot, and then again in his presence at [[Wilton, Wiltshire|Wilton]] in May</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Plummer|1911}} The defeat at Wilton smashed any remaining hope that Alfred could drive the invaders from his kingdom</span>
				<span class='text'>He was forced instead to make peace with them, according to sources that do not tell what the terms of the peace were</span>
				<span class='text'>Bishop Asser claimed that the 'pagans' agreed to vacate the realm and made good their promise</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=140–141}}Indeed, the Viking army did withdraw from Reading in the autumn of 871 to take up winter quarters in Mercian London</span>
				<span class='text'>Although not mentioned by Asser or by the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', Alfred probably also paid the Vikings cash to leave, much as the Mercians were to do in the following year</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=140–141}} [[Hoard]]s dating to the Viking occupation of London in 871/2 have been excavated at [[Croydon]], [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]], and [[Waterloo Bridge]]</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Plummer|1911}} He then pursued the Danes to their stronghold at [[Chippenham]] and starved them into submission</span>
				<span class='text'>One of the terms of the surrender was that Guthrum convert to [[Christianity]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Three weeks later the Danish king and 29 of his chief men were baptised at Alfred's court at Aller, near [[Athelney]], with Alfred receiving Guthrum as his spiritual son</span>

				<span class='text'>There is no contemporary evidence that Alfred and Guthrum agreed upon a formal treaty at this time; the so-called [[Treaty of Wedmore]] is an invention of modern historians</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum]], preserved in [[Old English]] in [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]] (Manuscript 383), and in a [[Latin]] compilation known as ''[[Quadripartitus]]'', was negotiated later, perhaps in 879 or 880, when King [[Ceolwulf II of Mercia]] was deposed</span>

				<span class='text'>Despite this relative peace, the king was still forced to deal with a number of Danish raids and incursions</span>
				<span class='text'>Among these was a raid taking place in [[Kent]], an allied country in [[South East England]], during the year 885, which was quite possibly the largest raid since the battles with Guthrum</span>

				<span class='text'>etween the restoration of [[London]] and the resumption of large scale Danish attacks in the early 890s, Alfred's reign was rather uneventful</span>

				<span class='text'>==Further Viking attacks repelled (890s)===After another lull, in the autumn of 892 or 893, the Danes attacked again</span>

				<span class='text'>52–53]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Wessex's history of failures preceding his success in 878 emphasised to Alfred that the traditional system of battle he had inherited played to the Danes' advantage</span>
				<span class='text'>While both the Anglo-Saxons and the Danes attacked settlements to seize wealth and other resources, they employed very different strategies</span>
				<span class='text'>In their raids, the Anglo-Saxons traditionally preferred to attack head-on by assembling their forces in a [[shield wall]], advancing against their target and overcoming the oncoming wall marshaled against them in defence</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Abels 1998 pages=194–5&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Abels|1998|pages=194–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;In contrast, the Danes preferred to choose easy targets, mapping cautious forays designed to avoid risking all their accumulated plunder with high-stake attacks for more</span>
				<span class='text'>Alfred determined their strategy was to launch smaller scaled attacks from a secure and reinforced defensible base to which they could retreat should their raiders meet strong resistance</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Abels 1998 pages=194–5&quot;/&gt; These bases were prepared in advance, often by capturing an estate and augmenting its defences with surrounding ditches, [[defensive wall|ramparts]] and [[palisade]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>Once inside the fortification, Alfred realised, the Danes enjoyed the advantage, better situated to outlast their opponents or crush them with a counter-attack as the provisions and stamina of the besieging forces waned</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Abels 1998 pages=194–5&quot;/&gt;The means by which the Anglo-Saxons marshaled forces to defend against marauders also left them vulnerable to the Vikings</span>
				<span class='text'>It was the responsibility of the shire fyrd to deal with local raids</span>
				<span class='text'>The king could call up the national militia to defend the kingdom; however, in the case of hit and run raids by Vikings, problems with communication and raising supplies meant that the national militia could not be mustered quickly enough: It was only after the raids were underway that a call went out to landowners to gather men for battle</span>
				<span class='text'>Large regions could be devastated before the newly assembled fyrd arrived</span>
				<span class='text'>And although the landowners were obliged to the king to supply these men when called, during the attacks in 878, many of them opportunistically abandoned their king and collaborated with Guthrum</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abels|1998|pages=139, 152}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cannon398&gt;{{harvnb|Cannon|1997|page=398}}&lt;/ref&gt;With these lessons in mind, Alfred capitalised on the relatively peaceful years immediately following his victory at Edington by focusing on an ambitious restructuring of his kingdom's military defences</span>
				<span class='text'>On a trip to Rome, Alfred had stayed with [[Charles the Bald]] and it is possible that he may have studied how the Carolingian kings had dealt with the Viking problem, and learning from their experience was able to put together a system of taxation and defence for his own kingdom</span>
				<span class='text'>Also, there had been a system of fortifications in pre-Viking Mercia that may have been an influence</span>
				<span class='text'>So when the Viking raids resumed in 892, Alfred was better prepared to confront them with a standing, mobile field army, a network of garrisons, and a small fleet of ships navigating the rivers and estuaries</span>

				<span class='text'>This threefold obligation has traditionally been called ''trinoda neccessitas'' or ''trimoda neccessitas</span>
				<span class='text'>'&lt;ref name=lavelle70&gt;{{harvnb|Lavelle|2010|pages=70–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Old English name for the fine due for neglecting military service was  ''fierdwite'' or ''fyrdwitee''&lt;ref name=attenborough52 /&gt;To maintain the [[burh]]s, and to reorganize the fyrd as a standing army, Alfred expanded the tax and conscription system based on the productivity of a tenant's landholding</span>
				<span class='text'>The hide was the basic unit of the system on which the tenant's public obligations were assessed</span>
				<span class='text'>A hide is thought to represent the amount of land required to support one family</span>
				<span class='text'>The hide would differ in size according to the value and resources of the land and the landowner would have to provide service based on how many hides he owned</span>

				<span class='text'>vg|thumb|A map of [[burh]]s named in the [[Burghal Hidage]]</span>
				<span class='text'>]At the centre of Alfred's reformed military defence system was the network of [[burh]]s, distributed at strategic points throughout the kingdom</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratt|2007|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were thirty-three in total, spaced approximately {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=off}} apart, enabling the military to confront attacks anywhere in the kingdom within a single day</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hull|2006|page=xx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abels|1998|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;Alfred's burhs (later termed [[boroughs]]) ranged from former Roman towns, such as Winchester, where the stone walls were repaired and ditches added, to massive earthen walls surrounded by wide ditches probably reinforced with wooden [[revetment]]s and palisades such as at Burpham, Sussex</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=welch127&gt;{{harvnb|Welch|1992|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abels|1998|page=304}}&lt;/ref&gt; The size of the burhs ranged from tiny outposts such as Pilton to large fortifications in established towns, the largest at [[Winchester]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bradshaw|1999}}, which is referenced in {{harvnb|Hull|2006|page=xx}}&lt;/ref&gt;A contemporary document now known as the [[Burghal Hidage]] provides an insight into how the system worked</span>
				<span class='text'>It lists the hidage for each of the fortified towns contained in the document</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, Wallingford had a hidage of 2400 which meant that the landowners there were responsible for supplying and feeding 2,400 men, the number sufficient for maintaining {{convert|9900|ft|km|abbr=off}} of wall</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=rumble5&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|Rumble|1996|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A total of 27,071 soldiers were needed system wide, or approximately one in four of all the free men in Wessex</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abels|1998|pages=204–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;Many of the burhs were twin towns that straddled a river and connected by a fortified bridge, like those built by [[Charles the Bald]] a generation before</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=keynes14/&gt; The double-burh blocked passage on the river, forcing Viking ships to navigate under a garrisoned bridge lined with men armed with stones, spears, or arrows</span>
				<span class='text'>Other burhs were sited near fortified royal villas allowing the king better control over his strongholds</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abels|1998|pages=198–202}}&lt;/ref&gt;This network of well-garrisoned burhs posed significant obstacles to Viking invaders, especially those laden with booty</span>
				<span class='text'>The system threatened Viking routes and communications making it far more dangerous for the Viking raiders</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the Vikings lacked both the equipment necessary to undertake a siege against the burh and a developed doctrine of [[siegecraft]], having tailored their methods of fighting to rapid strikes and unimpeded retreats to well defended fortifications</span>
				<span class='text'>The only means left to them was to starve the burh into submission, but this allowed the king time to send assistance with his mobile field army or garrisons from neighbouring burhs</span>
				<span class='text'>In such cases, the Vikings were extremely vulnerable to pursuit by the king's joint military forces</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abels|1988|page=204, 304}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alfred's burh system posed such a formidable challenge against Viking attack that when the Vikings returned in 892 and successfully stormed a half-made, poorly garrisoned fortress up the Lympne estuary in [[Kent]], the Anglo-Saxons were able to limit their penetration to the outer frontiers of Wessex and Mercia</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abels|1998|pages=287,304}}&lt;/ref&gt;Alfred's burghal system was revolutionary in its strategic conception and potentially expensive in its execution</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;But, clearly, the author of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' and probably Alfred himself regarded 897 as marking an important development in the naval power of Wessex</span>
				<span class='text'>The chronicler flattered his royal patron by boasting that Alfred's ships were not only larger, but swifter, steadier and rode higher in the water than either Danish or Frisian ships</span>
				<span class='text'>It is probable that, under the classical tutelage of Asser, Alfred utilised the design of [[Hellenistic-era warships|Greek and Roman warships]], with high sides, designed for fighting rather than for navigation</span>

				<span class='text'>It has been suggested that, like sea battles in late Viking age Scandinavia, these battles may have entailed a ship coming alongside an enemy vessel, at which point the crew would lash the two ships together before boarding the enemy craft</span>

				<span class='text'>pp</span>
				<span class='text'>2–93&lt;/ref&gt; Together these laws are arranged into 120 chapters</span>
				<span class='text'>In his introduction, Alfred explains that he gathered together the laws he found in many &quot;[[synod]]-books&quot; and &quot;ordered to be written many of the ones that our forefathers observed—those that pleased me; and many of the ones that did not please me, I rejected with the advice of my councillors, and commanded them to be observed in a different way</span>

				<span class='text'>164</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Alfred singled out in particular the laws that he &quot;found in the days of Ine, my kinsman, or [[Offa]], king of the Mercians, or King [[Æthelberht of Kent]], who first among the English people received baptism</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He appended rather than integrated the laws of Ine into his code, and although he included, as had Æthelbert, a scale of payments in compensation for injuries to various body parts, the two injury tariffs are not aligned</span>
				<span class='text'>Offa is not known to have issued a law code, leading historian [[Patrick Wormald]] to speculate that Alfred had in mind the legatine capitulary of 786 that was presented to Offa by two papal legates</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wormald|2001|pp=280–1}}&lt;/ref&gt;About a fifth of the law code is taken up by Alfred's introduction, which includes translations into English of the [[Ten Commandments|Decalogue]], a few chapters from the [[Book of Exodus]], and the &quot;Apostolic Letter&quot; from [[Acts of the Apostles]] (15:23–29)</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Abels|1998|p=248}}This is the reason that Alfred divided his code into precisely 120 chapters: 120 was the age at which Moses died and, in the number-symbolism of early medieval biblical exegetes, 120 stood for law</span>

				<span class='text'>The mercy that Christ infused into Mosaic Law underlies the injury tariffs that figure so prominently in barbarian law codes, since Christian synods &quot;established, through that mercy which Christ taught, that for almost every misdeed at the first offence secular lords might with their permission receive without sin the monetary compensation, which they then fixed</span>

				<span class='text'>It reflected Alfred's own belief in a doctrine of divine rewards and punishments rooted in a vision of a hierarchical Christian world order in which God is the Lord to whom kings owe obedience and through whom they derive their authority over their followers</span>
				<span class='text'>The need to persuade his nobles to undertake work for the 'common good' led Alfred and his court scholars to strengthen and deepen the conception of Christian kingship that he had inherited by building upon the legacy of earlier kings such as Offa as well as clerical writers such as Bede, Alcuin and the other luminaries of the [[Carolingian renaissance]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This was not a cynical use of religion to manipulate his subjects into obedience, but an intrinsic element in Alfred's worldview</span>
				<span class='text'>He believed, as did other kings in ninth-century England and Francia, that God had entrusted him with the spiritual as well as physical welfare of his people</span>
				<span class='text'>If the Christian faith fell into ruin in his kingdom, if the clergy were too ignorant to understand the Latin words they butchered in their offices and liturgies, if the ancient monasteries and collegiate churches lay deserted out of indifference, he was answerable before God, as Josiah had been</span>
				<span class='text'>Alfred's ultimate responsibility was the pastoral care of his people</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=219–257}}==Appearance and character==[[Asser]] wrote of Alfred in his ''[[Asser|Life of King Alfred]]'':&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Now, he was greatly loved, more than all his brothers, by his father and mother—indeed, by everybody—with a universal and profound love, and he was always brought up in the royal court and nowhere else</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>[He] was seen to be more comely in appearance than his other brothers, and more pleasing in manner, speech and behaviour </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>[and] in spite of all the demands of the present life, it has been the desire for wisdom, more than anything else, together with the nobility of his birth, which have characterized the nature of his noble mind</span>

				<span class='text'>Pages 74–75</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;It is also written by Asser that Alfred did not learn to read until he was twelve years old or later, which is described as 'shameful negligence' of his parents and tutors</span>
				<span class='text'>It is true, however, that Alfred was an excellent listener and had an incredible memory, and he retained poetry and psalms very well</span>
				<span class='text'>A story is told by Asser about how his mother held up a book of Saxon poetry to him and his brothers, and said; 'I shall give this book to whichever one of you can learn it the fastest</span>
				<span class='text'> After excitedly asking, 'Will you really give this book to the one of us who can understand it the soonest and recite it to you?' Alfred then took it to his teacher, learned it, and recited it back to his mother</span>

				<span class='text'>75</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Alfred is also noted as carrying around a small book, probably an ancient version of a small pocket notebook, which contained psalms and many prayers that he often collected</span>
				<span class='text'>Asser writes: &quot;[these] he collected in a single book, as I have seen for myself; amid all the affairs of the present life he took it around with him everywhere for the sake of prayer, and was inseparable from it</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Keynes, Simon 1983</span>
				<span class='text'>Page 75&quot;/&gt;An excellent hunter in every branch of the sport, Alfred is remembered as an enthusiastic huntsman against whom nobody’s skills could compare</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Keynes, Simon 1983</span>
				<span class='text'>Page 75&quot;/&gt;Although he was the youngest of his brothers, he was probably the most open-minded</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite eventually becoming one of the greatest warriors and forgers of peace in the kingdom, he was an early advocate for education</span>
				<span class='text'>His desire for learning could have come from his early love of English poetry and inability to read or physically record them until later in life</span>
				<span class='text'>Asser writes that &quot;[Alfred] could not satisfy his craving for what he desired the most, namely the liberal arts; for, as he used to say, there were no good scholars in the entire kingdom of the West Saxons at that time</span>

				<span class='text'>His mother was [[Osburga]] daughter of Oslac of the [[Isle of Wight]], Chief [[Butler]] of England</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Asser]], in his ''Vita Ælfredi'' asserts that this shows his lineage from the [[Jutes]] of the Isle of Wight</span>
