				<span class='text'>The first Soviet atomic device was tested on August 29 1949</span>
				<span class='text'>After moving to  in 1950 Sakharov played a key role in the development of the first megaton range Soviet hydrogen bomb using a design known as Sakharovs Third Idea in Russia and the  in the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>Before his Third Idea Sakharov tried a layer cake of alternating layers of fission and fusion fuel</span>
				<span class='text'>The results were disappointing yielding no more than a typical fission bomb</span>
				<span class='text'>However the design was seen to be worth pursuing because deuterium is abundant and uranium is scarce and he had no idea how powerful the US design was</span>
				<span class='text'>One of the  changed that because the magnitude of the explosion became public knowledge when there was a dispute between Japan and the US over the contamination of a large area of ocean</span>
				<span class='text'>Sakharov was surprised by the size of the explosion and realized that the Americans had harnessed the power of a separate fission explosion to compress the fusion fuel</span>
				<span class='text'>Sakharov realised that in order to cause the explosion of one side of the fuel to symmetrically compress the fusion fuel a mirror could be used to lect the radiation</span>
				<span class='text'>The details had not been officially declassified in Russia when Sakharov was writing his memoirs but in the  soft X rays emitted by the fission bomb were focused onto a cylinder of lithium deuteride to compress it symmetrically</span>
				<span class='text'>This is called </span>
				<span class='text'>The Teller Ulam design also had a secondary fission device inside the fusion cylinder to assist with the compression of the fusion fuel and generate neutrons to convert some of the lithium to tritium producing a mixture of deuterium and tritium</span>
				<span class='text'>  Sakarovs idea was first tested as  in 1955</span>
				<span class='text'>A larger variation of the same design which Sakharov worked on was the 50ampnbspMt  of October 1961 which was the most powerful nuclear device ever detonated</span>
				<span class='text'>akharov saw striking parallels between his fate and those of  and  in the USA</span>
				<span class='text'>Sakharov believed that in this tragic confrontation of two outstanding people both deserved respect because each of them was certain he had right on his side and was morally obligated to go to the end in the name of truth</span>
				<span class='text'>While Sakharov strongly disagreed with Teller over  and the  he believed that American academics had been unfair to Tellers resolve to get the H bomb for the United States since all steps by the Americans of a temporary or permanent rejection of developing thermonuclear weapons would have been seen either as a clever feint or as the manifestation of stupidity</span>
				<span class='text'>In both cases the reaction would have been the same – avoid the trap and immediately take advantage of the enemys stupidity</span>
				<span class='text'>akharov never felt that by creating nuclear weapons he had known sin in Oppenheimers expression</span>

				<span class='text'>Quotations  In this pamphlet advanced for discussion by its readers the author has set himself the goal to present with the greatest conviction and frankness two theses that are supported by many people in the world</span>
				<span class='text'>These are# The division of mankind threatens it with destructionampnbsp</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Only universal cooperation under conditions of intellectual freedom and the lofty moral ideals of  and labor accompanied by the elimination of dogmatism and pressure of the concealed interests of ruling classes will preserve civilizationampnbsp</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'># The second basic thesis is that intellectual freedom is essential to human society – freedom to obtain and distribute information freedom for open minded and unfearing debate and freedom from pressure by officialdom and prejudices</span>
				<span class='text'>Such a trinity of freedom of thought is the only guarantee against an infection of people by mass myths which in the hands of treacherous hypocrites and demagogues can be transformed into bloody dictatorship</span>
				<span class='text'>Freedom of thought is the only guarantee of the feasibility of a scientific democratic approach to politics economics and culture</span>

				<span class='text'>The UIS will have individual miniature computer terminals central control points for the flood of information and communication channels incorporating thousands of artificial communications from satellites cables and laser lines</span>
				<span class='text'>Even the partial realization of the UIS will profoundly affect every person his leisure activities and his intellectual and artistic development</span>

				<span class='text'> Thousands of years ago tribes of human beings suffered great privations in the struggle to survive</span>
				<span class='text'>In this struggle it was important not only to be able to handle a club but also to possess the ability to think reasonably to take care of the knowledge and experience garnered by the tribe and to develop the links that would provide cooperation with other tribes</span>
				<span class='text'>Today the entire human race is faced with a similar test</span>
				<span class='text'>In infinite space many civilizations are bound to exist among them civilizations that are also wiser and more successful than ours</span>
				<span class='text'>I support the cosmological hypothesis which states that the development of the universe is repeated in its basic features an infinite number of times</span>
				<span class='text'>In accordance with this other civilizations including more successful ones should exist an infinite number of times on the preceding and the following pages of the Book of the Universe</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet this should not minimize our sacred endeavors in this world of ours where like faint glimmers of light in the dark we have emerged for a moment from the nothingness of dark unconsciousness of material existence</span>
				<span class='text'>We must make good the demands of reason and create a life worthy of ourselves and of the goals we only dimly perceive</span>
