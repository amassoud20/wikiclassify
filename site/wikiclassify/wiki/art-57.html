				<span class='text'>] in 1947</span>
				<span class='text'>==Development of thermonuclear devices==={{main|RDS-37|Tsar Bomba}}After the end of [[World War II]], he researched [[cosmic ray]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>In mid-1948 he participated in the [[Soviet atomic bomb project]] under [[Igor Kurchatov]] and [[Igor Tamm]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The first Soviet atomic device was tested on August 29, 1949</span>
				<span class='text'>After moving to [[Sarov]] in 1950, Sakharov played a key role in the development of the first megaton-range Soviet hydrogen bomb using a design known as ''Sakharov's Third Idea'' in Russia and the [[Teller-Ulam design]] in the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>Before his ''Third Idea'', Sakharov tried a &quot;layer cake&quot; of alternating layers of fission and fusion fuel</span>
				<span class='text'>The results were disappointing, yielding no more than a typical fission bomb</span>
				<span class='text'>However the design was seen to be worth pursuing because deuterium is abundant and uranium is scarce, and he had no idea how powerful the US design was</span>
				<span class='text'>One of the [[Bikini atomic experiments]] changed that, because the magnitude of the explosion became public knowledge when there was a dispute between Japan and the US over the contamination of a large area of ocean</span>
				<span class='text'>Sakharov was surprised by the size of the explosion and realized that the Americans had harnessed the power of a separate fission explosion to compress the fusion fuel</span>
				<span class='text'>Sakharov realised that in order to cause the explosion of one side of the fuel to symmetrically compress the fusion fuel, a mirror could be used to reflect the radiation</span>
				<span class='text'>The details had not been officially declassified in Russia when Sakharov was writing his memoirs, but in the [[Teller-Ulam design]], soft X-rays emitted by the fission bomb were focused onto a cylinder of lithium deuteride to compress it symmetrically</span>
				<span class='text'>This is called [[radiation implosion]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Teller-Ulam design also had a secondary fission device inside the fusion cylinder to assist with the compression of the fusion fuel and generate neutrons to convert some of the lithium to tritium, producing a mixture of deuterium and tritium</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sakharov, Andrei|title=Memoirs|publisher=Vintage|date=1992|isbn=067973595X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gorelik, Gennady; Bouis, Antonina|title=The world of Andrei Sakharov: a Russian physicist's path to freedom|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=019515620X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sakarov's idea was first tested as [[RDS-37]] in 1955</span>
				<span class='text'>A larger variation of the same design which Sakharov worked on was the 50&amp;nbsp;Mt [[Tsar Bomba]] of October 1961, which was the most powerful nuclear device ever detonated</span>
				<span class='text'>akharov saw &quot;striking parallels&quot; between his fate and those of [[J</span>
				<span class='text'>Robert Oppenheimer]] and [[Edward Teller]] in the USA</span>
				<span class='text'>Sakharov believed that in this &quot;tragic confrontation of two outstanding people&quot;, both deserved respect, because &quot;each of them was certain he had right on his side and was morally obligated to go to the end in the name of truth</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; While Sakharov strongly disagreed with Teller over [[Nuclear weapons testing|nuclear testing in the atmosphere]] and the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]], he believed that American academics had been unfair to Teller's resolve to get the H-bomb for the United States since &quot;all steps by the Americans of a temporary or permanent rejection of developing thermonuclear weapons would have been seen either as a clever feint, or as the manifestation of stupidity</span>
				<span class='text'>In both cases, the reaction would have been the same ‚Äì avoid the trap and immediately take advantage of the enemy's stupidity</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;Sakharov never felt that by creating nuclear weapons he had &quot;known sin&quot;, in Oppenheimer's expression</span>
				<span class='text'>He later wrote: &quot;After more than forty years, we have had no [[third world war]], and the [[Mutual assured destruction|balance of nuclear terror]]&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>may have helped to prevent one</span>
				<span class='text'>But I am not at all sure of this; back then, in those long-gone years, the question didn't even arise</span>
				<span class='text'>What most troubles me now is the instability of the balance, the extreme peril of the current situation, the appalling waste of the arms race&amp;nbsp;</span>

				<span class='text'>Sakharov, in association with [[Igor Tamm]], proposed confining extremely hot ionized [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] by [[torus]] shaped [[magnetic field]]s for controlling [[thermonuclear fusion]] that led to the development of the tokamak device</span>

				<span class='text'>He called these devices MC or MK (for ''magnetocumulative'') generators</span>
				<span class='text'>The radial MK-1 produced a pulsed magnetic field of 25 [[gauss (unit)|megagauss]] (2500 [[tesla (unit)|teslas]])</span>
				<span class='text'>The resulting helical MK-2 generated 1000 million amperes in 1953</span>
				<span class='text'>akharov then tested a MK-driven &quot;plasma cannon&quot; where a small aluminum ring was vaporized by huge [[eddy current]]s into a stable, self-confined [[torus|toroidal]] [[plasmoid]] and was accelerated to 100&amp;nbsp;km/s</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Sakharov later suggested replacing the copper [[Electromagnetic coil|coil]] in MK generators with a large [[Superconductivity|superconductor]] [[solenoid]] to magnetically compress and focus [[Nuclear testing|underground nuclear explosions]] into a [[shaped charge]] effect</span>
				<span class='text'>He theorized this could focus 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; [[proton]]s per second on a 1&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; surface</span>

				<span class='text'>52: 349‚Äì351 (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;He tried to explain the [[baryon asymmetry]] of the universe, being the first scientist to introduce two universes called &quot;sheets&quot;, linked by the [[Big Bang]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Sakharov achieved there a complete [[CPT symmetry]] since the second sheet is [[Chirality (mathematics)|enantiomorph]] ([[P-symmetry]]), has an opposite [[arrow of time]] ([[T-symmetry]]) and is mainly populated by [[antimatter]] ([[C-symmetry]]) because of an opposite [[CP-violation]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In this model the two universes do not interact, except via local matter accumulation whose density and pressure become high enough to connect the two sheets through a bridge without [[spacetime]] between them, but with [[geodesic]]s continuity beyond the radius limit allowing an exchange of matter</span>
				<span class='text'>Sakharov called such [[Gravitational singularity|singularities]] a ''collapse'' and an ''anticollapse'', which are an alternative to the couple [[black hole]] and [[white hole]] in the [[wormhole]] theory</span>
				<span class='text'>Sakharov also proposed the idea of [[induced gravity]] as an alternative theory of [[quantum gravity]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==Turn to activism===Since the late 1950s Sakharov had become concerned about the moral and political implications of his work</span>
				<span class='text'>Politically active during the 1960s, Sakharov was against [[nuclear proliferation]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Pushing for the end of atmospheric tests, he played a role in the 1963 [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]], signed in Moscow</span>
				<span class='text'>he major turn in Sakharov's political evolution came in 1967, when [[anti-ballistic missile]] defense became a key issue in US‚ÄìSoviet relations</span>
				<span class='text'>In a secret detailed letter to the Soviet leadership of July 21, 1967, Sakharov explained the need to &quot;take the Americans at their word&quot; and accept their proposal for a &quot;bilateral rejection by the USA and the Soviet Union of the development of antiballistic missile defense&quot;, because otherwise an arms race in this new technology would increase the likelihood of nuclear war</span>
				<span class='text'>He also asked permission to publish his manuscript (which accompanied the letter) in a newspaper to explain the dangers posed by this kind of defense</span>
				<span class='text'>The government ignored his letter and refused to let him initiate a public discussion of ABMs in the Soviet press</span>

				<span class='text'>&quot;At first I thought, despite everything that I saw with my own eyes, that the Soviet state was a breakthrough into the future, a kind of prototype for all countries&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Then he came, in his words, to &quot;the theory of symmetry: all governments and regimes to a first approximation are bad, all peoples are oppressed, and all are threatened by common dangers</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; After that he realized that there is not much &quot;symmetry between a cancer cell and a normal one</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet our state is similar to a cancer cell ‚Äì with its messianism and expansionism, its totalitarian suppression of dissent, the authoritarian structure of power, with a total absence of public control in the most important decisions in domestic and foreign policy, a closed society that does not inform its citizens of anything substantial, closed to the outside world, without freedom of travel or the exchange of information</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;people&quot; /&gt; Sakharov's ideas on social development led him to put forward the principle of human rights as a new basis of all politics</span>
				<span class='text'>In his works he declared that &quot;the principle '[[Everything which is not forbidden is allowed|what is not prohibited is allowed]]' should be understood literally&quot;, defying the unwritten ideological rules imposed by the Communist ruling elite on the society in spite of the seemingly democratic [[USSR Constitution]]</span>

				<span class='text'>I am against all kinds of self-immolation (for myself and for others, including the people closest to me)</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; In a letter written from exile, he cheered up a fellow physicist and human rights activist with the words: &quot;Fortunately, the future is unpredictable and also ‚Äì because of [[quantum effects]] ‚Äì uncertain</span>

				<span class='text'>Such a trinity of freedom of thought is the only guarantee against an infection of people by mass myths, which, in the hands of treacherous hypocrites and demagogues, can be transformed into bloody dictatorship</span>
