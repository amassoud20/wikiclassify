				<span class='text'>he sangha traveled through the subcontinent expounding the dharma</span>
				<span class='text'>This continued throughout the year except during the four months of the  rainy season when ascetics of all religions rarely traveled</span>
				<span class='text'>One reason was that it was more difficult to do so without causing harm to animal life</span>
				<span class='text'>At this time of year the sangha would retreat to monasteries public parks or forests where people would come to them</span>

				<span class='text'>eachingsInformation of the oldest teachings may be obtained by analysis of the oldest texts</span>
				<span class='text'>One method to obtain information on the oldest core of Buddhism is to compare the oldest extant versions of the Theravadin  and other texts</span>
				<span class='text'>The reliability of these sources and the possibility to draw out a core of oldest teachings is a matter of dispute</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Vetter inconsistencies remain and other methods must be applied to resolve those inconsistencies</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to Schmithausen three positions held by scholars of Buddhism can be distinguished# Stress on the fundamental homogeneity and substantial authenticity of at least a considerable part of the Nikayic materials# Scepticism with regard to the possibility of retrieving the doctrine of earliest Buddhism# Cautious optimism in this respect</span>
				<span class='text'> core problem in the study of early Buddhism is the relation between dhyana and insight</span>
				<span class='text'>Schmithausen in his often cited article On some Aspects of Descriptions or Theories of Liberating Insight and Enlightenment in Early Buddhism notes that the mention of the four noble truths as constituting liberating insight which is attained after mastering the Rupa Jhanas is a later addition to texts such as Majjhima Nikaya 36</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to Tilmann Vetter the core of earliest Buddhism is the practice of  as a workable alternative to painfull ascetic practices</span>
				<span class='text'>Bronkhorst agrees that dhyana was a Buddhist invention whereas Norman notes that the Buddhas way to release </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>was by means of meditative practices</span>
				<span class='text'>Discriminating insight into transiency as a separate path to liberation was a later development</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to the Mahāsaccakasutta from the fourth  the Buddha gained </span>
				<span class='text'>Yet it is not clear what he was awakened to</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Schmithausen and Bronkhorst liberating insight is a later addition to this text and lects a later development and understanding in early Buddhism</span>
				<span class='text'>The mentioning of the four truths as constituting liberating insight introduces a logical problem since the four truths depict a linear path of practice the knowledge of which is in itself not depicted as being liberatingAlthough  Sanskrit Nirvāna is the common term for the desired goal of this practice many other terms can be found throughout the Nikayas which are not specified</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to Vetter the description of the Buddhist path may initially have been as simple as the term the middle way</span>
				<span class='text'>In time this short description was elaborated resulting in the description of the eightfold path</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to both Bronkhorst and Anderson the  became a substitution for prajna or liberating insight in the suttas in those texts where liberating insight was preceded by the four jhanas</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Bronkhorst the four truths may not have been formulated in earliest Buddhism and did not serve in earliest Buddhism as a description of liberating insight</span>

				<span class='text'>he  was in origin probably a brahmanic term but its usage may have been common to the Sramana traditions</span>
				<span class='text'>n time liberating insight became an essential feature of the Buddhist tradition</span>
				<span class='text'>The following teachings which are commonly seen as essential to Buddhism are later formulations which form part of the explanatory framework of this liberating insight The  that suffering is an ingrained part of existence that the origin of suffering is craving for sensuality acquisition of identity and fear of annihilation that suffering can be ended and that following the  is the means to accomplish this The Noble Eightfold Path right view right intention right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentration  the mind creates suffering as a natural product of a complex process</span>
