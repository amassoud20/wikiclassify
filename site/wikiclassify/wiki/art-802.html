				<span class='text'>The battle ended in humiliating defeat and capture for Romanus</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, the Empire temporarily lost control over most of [[Asia Minor]] to the invading [[Seljuk Turks]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Nicholas' tomb in Myra had become a popular place of pilgrimage</span>
				<span class='text'>Because of the many wars and attacks in the region, some Christians were concerned that access to the tomb might become difficult</span>
				<span class='text'>For both the religious and commercial advantages of a major pilgrimage site, the Italian cities of Venice and Bari vied to get the Nicholas relics</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=center/&gt; Taking advantage of the confusion, in the spring of 1087, sailors from [[Bari]] in Apulia seized part of the remains of the saint from his [[St</span>

				<span class='text'>Returning to Bari, they brought the remains with them and cared for them</span>

				<span class='text'>There are numerous variations of this account</span>
				<span class='text'>In some versions those taking the relics are characterized as thieves or pirates, in others they are said to have taken them in response to a [[Vision (religion)|vision]] wherein Saint Nicholas himself appeared and commanded that his relics be moved in order to preserve them from the impending Muslim conquest</span>

				<span class='text'>241-269&lt;/ref&gt; After the relics were brought to [[Bari]], they continued to do so, much to the joy of the new owners</span>
				<span class='text'>Vials of myrrh from his relics have been taken all over the world for centuries, and can still be obtained from his church in Bari</span>
				<span class='text'>Even up to the present day, a flask of manna is extracted from the tomb of Saint Nicholas every year on 6 December (the Saint's [[feast day]]) by the clergy of the basilica</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[myrrh]] is collected from a sarcophagus which is located in the basilica vault and could be obtained in the shop nearby</span>
				<span class='text'>The liquid gradually seeps out of the tomb, but it is unclear whether it originates from the body within the tomb, or from the marble itself; since the town of Bari is a harbour, and the tomb is below [[sea level]], there have been several natural explanations proposed for the manna fluid, including the transfer of [[seawater]] to the tomb by [[capillary action]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Another version of this story, possibly formed around the 11th century, claims that the butcher's victims were instead three clerks who wished to stay the night</span>
				<span class='text'>The man murdered them, and was advised by his wife to dispose of them by turning them into meat pies</span>

				<span class='text'>Nicholas invited the sailors to unload a part of the wheat to help in the time of need</span>
				<span class='text'>The sailors at first disliked the request, because the wheat had to be weighed accurately and delivered to the Emperor</span>
				<span class='text'>Only when Nicholas promised them that they would not suffer any loss for their consideration, the sailors agreed</span>
				<span class='text'>When they arrived later in the capital, they made a surprising find: the weight of the load had not changed, although the wheat removed in Myra was enough for two full years and could even be used for sowing</span>

				<span class='text'>Desiring a serene time of preparation, Nicholas set sail on an Egyptian ship where the other pilgrims did not know who he was</span>
				<span class='text'>The first night he dreamed a storm would put them all at peril</span>
				<span class='text'>When he awoke in the morning he warned the sailors that a severe storm was coming, but they need not fear, for &quot;God will protect us</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Almost immediately the sky darkened and strong winds roared round the ship</span>
				<span class='text'>The wind and waves made it impossible to keep the ship under control</span>
				<span class='text'>Even with lowered sails, the sailors feared for their very lives and begged Nicholas to pray for safety</span>
				<span class='text'>One sailor climbed the main mast, tightening the ropes so the mast would not crash onto the deck</span>
				<span class='text'>As he was coming back down, the sailor slipped, fell to the deck, and was killed</span>
				<span class='text'>While Nicholas prayed, the storm did quiet, relieving the sailors</span>
				<span class='text'>Their comfort, however, was dampened by grief over their comrade's death</span>
				<span class='text'>As Nicholas prayed over the dead sailor, he was revived, &quot;as if he had only been asleep</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The man awakened without pain and the ship finished the journey to the Holy Land</span>
				<span class='text'>Nicholas then embarked on his pilgrimage to the holy places, walking where Jesus had walked</span>
				<span class='text'>ne night while staying with a family in Jerusalem, he wanted to pray at the only church remaining in Jerusalem at that time</span>
				<span class='text'>It was the Church of the Room of the Last Supper on Mount Zion</span>
				<span class='text'>As he approached the heavy, locked doors, they swung open of their own accord, allowing him to enter the church</span>

				<span class='text'>This meant that they would remain unmarried and probably, in absence of any other possible employment, would have to become [[prostitutes]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Even if they did not, unmarried maidens in those days would have been assumed as being a prostitute</span>
				<span class='text'>Hearing of the girls' plight, Nicholas decided to help them, but being too modest to help the family in public (or to save them the humiliation of accepting charity), he went to the house under the cover of night and threw three [[money purse|purses]] (one for each daughter) filled with gold coins through the window opening into the house</span>
				<span class='text'>ne version has him throwing one purse for three consecutive nights</span>
				<span class='text'>Another has him throwing the purses over a period of three years, each time the night before one of the daughters comes of age</span>
				<span class='text'>Invariably, the third time the father lies in wait, trying to discover the identity of their benefactor</span>
				<span class='text'>In one version the father confronts the saint, only to have Nicholas say it is not him he should thank, but God alone</span>
				<span class='text'>In another version, Nicholas learns of the poor man's plan and drops the third bag down the chimney instead; a variant holds that the daughter had washed her stockings that evening and hung them over the embers to dry, and that the bag of gold fell into the stocking</span>

				<span class='text'>As part of this celebration, youths performed the functions of priests and bishops, and exercised rule over their elders</span>
				<span class='text'>Today, Saint Nicholas is still celebrated as a great gift-giver in several Western European and Central European countries</span>

				<span class='text'>According to another source, on 6 December every sailor or ex-sailor of the [[Low Countries]] (which at that time was virtually all of the male population) would descend to the harbour towns to participate in a church celebration for their patron saint</span>
				<span class='text'>On the way back they would stop at one of the various ''Nicholas fairs'' to buy some hard-to-come-by goods, gifts for their loved ones and invariably some little presents for their children</span>
				<span class='text'>While the real gifts would only be presented at Christmas, the little presents for the children were given right away, courtesy of Saint Nicholas</span>
				<span class='text'>This and his miracle of him resurrecting the three butchered children made Saint Nicholas a patron saint of children and later students as well</span>

				<span class='text'>Albanian Catholics often swear by Saint Nicholas, saying &quot;Pasha Shejnti Shen'Kollin!&quot; (&quot;May I see Holy Saint Nicholas!&quot;), indicating the importance of this saint in Albanian culture, especially among the Albanians of [[Malësia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>On the eve of his feast day, Albanians will light a candle and abstain from meat, preparing a feast of roasted lamb and pork, to be served to guests after midnight</span>
