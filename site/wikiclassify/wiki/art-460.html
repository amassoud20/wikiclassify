				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|left|| Stevenson's childhood home in Heriot Row]]Stevenson was born at 8&amp;nbsp;Howard Place, [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, on 13 November 1850 to [[Thomas Stevenson]] (1818–87), a leading [[lighthouse]] engineer, and his wife Margaret Isabella (née Balfour; 1829–97)</span>
				<span class='text'>He was christened Robert &lt;!--NOTE--&gt;Lewis&lt;!--&quot;Louis&quot; vs &quot;Lewis&quot; in footnote--&gt; Balfour Stevenson</span>
				<span class='text'>At about age 18, Stevenson was to change the spelling of &quot;Lewis&quot; to &quot;Louis&quot;, and in 1873 he dropped &quot;Balfour</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mehew (2004)</span>
				<span class='text'>The spelling &quot;Lewis&quot; is said to have been rejected because his father violently disliked another person of the same name, and the new spelling was not accompanied by a change of pronunciation: Balfour (1901) I, 29 n</span>
				<span class='text'>1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Furnas (1952), 23–4; Mehew (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;Lighthouse design was the family profession: Thomas's father (Robert's grandfather) was the famous [[Robert Stevenson (civil engineer)|Robert Stevenson]], and both of Thomas's brothers (Robert's uncles) [[Alan Stevenson|Alan]] and [[David Stevenson (engineer)|David]], were in the same field</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Paxton 2004&quot;&gt;Paxton (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, even Thomas's maternal grandfather, [[Thomas Smith (engineer)|Thomas Smith]], had been in the same profession</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Robert's mother's family were not of the same profession</span>
				<span class='text'>Margaret's natal family, the Balfours, were [[gentry]], tracing their lineage back to a certain Alexander Balfour who had held the lands of [[Inchyra]] in Fife in the fifteenth century</span>
				<span class='text'>Margaret's father, Lewis Balfour (1777–1860), was a [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] of the [[Church of Scotland]] at nearby [[Colinton]],&lt;ref&gt;Balfour (1901), 10–12; Furnas (1952), 24; Mehew (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; and her siblings included the physician [[George William Balfour]] and the marine engineer [[James Balfour (engineer)|James Balfour]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Stevenson spent the greater part of his boyhood holidays in his maternal grandfather's house</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Now I often wonder,&quot; wrote Stevenson, &quot;what I inherited from this old minister</span>
				<span class='text'>I must suppose, indeed, that he was fond of preaching [[sermon]]s, and so am I, though I never heard it maintained that either of us loved to hear them</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Furnas (1952), 34–6; Mehew (2004)</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Mehew 2004&quot;&gt;Mehew (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; He compulsively wrote stories throughout his childhood</span>

				<span class='text'>Retrieved: 1 August 2013</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In November 1867, Stevenson entered the [[University of Edinburgh]] to study engineering</span>
				<span class='text'>He showed from the start no enthusiasm for his studies and devoted much energy to avoiding lectures</span>
				<span class='text'>This time was more important for the friendships he made with other students in the [[The Speculative Society|Speculative Society]] (an exclusive debating club), particularly with Charles Baxter, who would become Stevenson's financial agent, and with a professor, [[Fleeming Jenkin]], whose house staged amateur drama in which Stevenson took part, and whose biography he would later write</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Furnas (1952), 51–54, 60–62; Mehew (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps most important at this point in his life was a cousin, Robert Alan Mowbray Stevenson (known as &quot;Bob&quot;), a lively and light-hearted young man who, instead of the family profession, had chosen to study art</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Balfour (1901) I, 86–8; 90–4; Furnas (1952), 64–9&lt;/ref&gt; Each year during vacations, Stevenson travelled to inspect the family's engineering works—to [[Anstruther]] and [[Wick, Highland|Wick]] in 1868, with his father on his official tour of [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]] islands lighthouses in 1869, and for three weeks to the island of [[Erraid]] in 1870</span>
				<span class='text'>He enjoyed the travels more for the material they gave for his writing than for any engineering interest</span>
				<span class='text'>The voyage with his father pleased him because a similar journey of [[Walter Scott]] with Robert Stevenson had provided the inspiration for Scott's 1822 novel ''[[The Pirate (novel)|The Pirate]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Balfour (1901) I, 70–2; Furnas (1952), 48–9; Mehew (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1871, Stevenson notified his father of his decision to pursue a life of letters</span>
				<span class='text'>Though the elder Stevenson was naturally disappointed, the surprise cannot have been great, and Stevenson's mother reported that he was &quot;wonderfully resigned&quot; to his son's choice</span>
				<span class='text'>To provide some security, it was agreed that Stevenson should read Law (again at Edinburgh University) and [[Admission to practice law|be called to the Scottish bar]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Balfour (1901) I, 85–6&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1887 poetry collection ''Underwoods'', Stevenson muses his turning from the family profession:&lt;ref&gt;''Underwoods'' (1887), Poem XXXVIII&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Say not of me that weakly I declined&lt;br&gt;The labours of my sires, and fled the sea,&lt;br&gt;The towers we founded and the lamps we lit,&lt;br&gt;To play at home with paper like a child</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;br&gt;But rather say: ''In the afternoon of time''&lt;br&gt;''A strenuous family dusted from its hands''&lt;br&gt;''The sand of granite, and beholding far''&lt;br&gt;''Along the sounding coast its pyramids''&lt;br&gt;''And tall memorials catch the dying sun,''&lt;br&gt;''Smiled well content, and to this childish task''&lt;br&gt;''Around the fire addressed its evening hours</span>
				<span class='text'>'&lt;/blockquote&gt;In other respects too, Stevenson was moving away from his upbringing</span>
				<span class='text'>His dress became more [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]]; he already wore his hair long, but he now took to wearing a velveteen jacket and rarely attended parties in conventional evening dress</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Furnas (1952), 69–70; Mehew (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Within the limits of a strict allowance, he visited cheap pubs and brothels</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Furnas (1952), 53–7; Mehew (2004</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, he had come to reject Christianity and declared himself an atheist</span>

				<span class='text'> Worse still, he affected a Bohemian style, haunted the seedier parts of the Old Town, read Charles Darwin and Herbert Spencer, and declared himself an atheist</span>

				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1873, his father came across the constitution of the LJR (Liberty, Justice, Reverence) Club, of which Stevenson and his cousin Bob were members, which began:  &quot;Disregard everything our parents have taught us&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>1877]]In late 1873, on a visit to a cousin in England, Stevenson met two people who were to be of great importance to him, [[Sidney Colvin]] and Fanny (Frances Jane) Sitwell</span>
				<span class='text'>Sitwell was a 34-year-old woman with a son, separated from her husband</span>
				<span class='text'>She attracted the devotion of many who met her, including Colvin, who eventually married her in 1901</span>
				<span class='text'>Stevenson was also drawn to her, and over several years they kept up a heated correspondence in which Stevenson wavered between the role of a suitor and a son (he came to address her as &quot;Madonna&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Furnas (1952), 81–2; 85–9; Mehew (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Colvin became Stevenson's literary adviser and after his death was the first editor of Stevenson's letters</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon after their first meeting, he had placed Stevenson's first paid contribution, an essay entitled &quot;Roads,&quot; in ''The Portfolio''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Furnas (1952), 84–5&lt;/ref&gt; Stevenson was soon active in London literary life, becoming acquainted with many of the writers of the time, including [[Andrew Lang]], [[Edmund Gosse]],&lt;ref&gt;Furnas (1952), 95; 101&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Leslie Stephen]], the editor of the ''[[Cornhill Magazine]]'', who took an interest in Stevenson's work</span>
				<span class='text'>Stephen in turn would introduce him to a more important friend</span>
				<span class='text'>Visiting Edinburgh in 1875, he took Stevenson with him to visit a patient at the [[Edinburgh Infirmary]], [[William Ernest Henley]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Henley, an energetic and talkative man with a wooden leg, became a close friend and occasional literary collaborator, until a quarrel broke up the friendship in 1888</span>
				<span class='text'>Henley is often seen as the model for Long John Silver in ''Treasure Island''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Balfour (1901) I, 123-4; Furnas (1952) 105–6; Mehew (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;In November 1873, after Stevenson's health failed, he was sent to [[Menton]] on the [[French Riviera]] to recuperate</span>
				<span class='text'>He returned in better health in April 1874 and settled down to his studies, but he returned to France several times after that</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Furnas (1952), 89–95&lt;/ref&gt; He made long and frequent trips to the neighbourhood of the [[Forest of Fontainebleau]], staying at [[Barbizon]], [[Grez-sur-Loing]], and [[Nemours]] and becoming a member of the artists' colonies there, as well as to Paris to visit galleries and the theatres</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Balfour (1901) I, 128–37&lt;/ref&gt; He did qualify for the Scottish bar in July 1875, and his father added a brass plate with &quot;R</span>

				<span class='text'>One of his journeys, a canoe voyage in Belgium and France with Sir Walter Simpson,&lt;ref&gt;Author of the influential 1887 book ''The Art of Golf''&lt;/ref&gt; a friend from the Speculative Society and frequent travel companion, was the basis of his first real book, ''[[An Inland Voyage]]'' (1878)</span>

				<span class='text'>He spent his summers at various places in Scotland and England, including [[Westbourne, Dorset]], a residential area in [[Bournemouth]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It was during his time in Bournemouth that he wrote the story ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'', naming one of the characters (Mr Poole) after the town of [[Poole]], which is situated next to Bournemouth</span>
