				<span class='text'>These four essays were published in the ''Memoirs'' of the Lit &amp; Phil in 1802</span>
				<span class='text'>he second of these essays opens with the striking remark,{{quote|''There can scarcely be a doubt entertained respecting the reducibility of all elastic fluids of whatever kind, into liquids; and we ought not to despair of effecting it in [[cryogenics|low temperatures]] and by strong pressures exerted upon the unmixed gases further''</span>
				<span class='text'>}After describing experiments to ascertain the pressure of steam at various points between 0 and 100&amp;nbsp;°C (32 and 212&amp;nbsp;°F), Dalton concluded from observations on the [[vapour pressure]] of six different liquids, that the variation of vapour pressure for all liquids is equivalent, for the same variation of temperature, reckoning from vapour of any given pressure</span>

				<span class='text'>The first published indications of this idea are to be found at the end of his paper on the absorption of gases already mentioned, which was read on 21 October 1803, though not published until 1805</span>
				<span class='text'>Here he says:{{quote|''Why does not water admit its bulk of every kind of gas alike? This question I have duly considered, and though I am not able to satisfy myself completely I am nearly persuaded that the circumstance depends on the weight and number of the ultimate particles of the several gases''</span>
				<span class='text'>}The main points of Dalton's atomic theory were:# Elements are made of extremely small particles called [[atom]]s</span>
				<span class='text'> Atoms of a given element are identical in size, mass, and other properties; atoms of different elements differ in size, mass, and other properties</span>
				<span class='text'> Atoms cannot be subdivided, created, or destroyed</span>
				<span class='text'> Atoms of different elements combine in simple whole-number ratios to form [[chemical compounds]]</span>
				<span class='text'> In [[chemical reactions]], atoms are combined, separated, or rearranged</span>
				<span class='text'>alton proposed an additional &quot;rule of greatest simplicity&quot; that created controversy, since it could not be independently confirmed</span>
				<span class='text'>When atoms combine in only one ratio, &quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>it must be presumed to be a binary one, unless some cause appear to the contrary&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>his was merely an assumption, derived from faith in the simplicity of nature</span>
				<span class='text'>No evidence was then available to scientists to deduce how many atoms of each element combine to form compound molecules</span>
				<span class='text'>But this or some other such rule was absolutely necessary to any incipient theory, since one needed an assumed molecular formula in order to calculate relative atomic weights</span>
				<span class='text'>In any case, Dalton's &quot;rule of greatest simplicity&quot; caused him to assume that the formula for water was OH and [[ammonia]] was NH, quite different from our modern understanding (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)</span>
				<span class='text'>espite the uncertainty at the heart of Dalton's atomic theory, the principles of the theory survived</span>
				<span class='text'>To be sure, the conviction that atoms cannot be subdivided, created, or destroyed into smaller particles when they are combined, separated, or rearranged in chemical reactions is inconsistent with the existence of [[nuclear fusion]] and [[nuclear fission]], but such processes are nuclear reactions and not chemical reactions</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, the idea that all atoms of a given element are identical in their physical and chemical properties is not precisely  true, as we now know that different [[isotope]]s of an element have slightly varying weights</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Dalton had created a theory of immense power and importance</span>
				<span class='text'>Indeed, Dalton's innovation was fully as important for the future of the science as [[Antoine Laurent Lavoisier]]'s oxygen-based chemistry had been</span>
				<span class='text'>==Atomic weights===Dalton proceeded to print his first published table of relative [[atomic weight]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>Six elements appear in this table, namely hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, sulfur, and phosphorus, with the atom of hydrogen conventionally assumed to weigh 1</span>
				<span class='text'>Dalton provided no indication in this first paper how he had arrived at these numbers</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} However, in his laboratory notebook under the date 6 September 1803&lt;ref&gt;Laboratory notebook in ibid</span>
				<span class='text'> p</span>
				<span class='text'>248&lt;/ref&gt; there appears a list in which he sets out the relative weights of the atoms of a number of elements, derived from analysis of water, [[ammonia]], [[carbon dioxide]], etc</span>
				<span class='text'>by chemists of the time</span>
				<span class='text'>t appears, then, that confronted with the problem of calculating the relative diameter of the atoms of which, he was convinced, all gases were made, he used the results of [[chemical analysis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Assisted by the assumption that combination always takes place in the simplest possible way, he thus arrived at the idea that chemical combination takes place between particles of different weights, and it was this which differentiated his theory from the historic speculations of the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], such as [[Democritus]] and [[Lucretius]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=March 2010}}The extension of this idea to substances in general necessarily led him to the [[law of multiple proportions]], and the comparison with experiment brilliantly confirmed his deduction</span>

				<span class='text'>]Dalton used his own symbols to visually represent the atomic structure of compounds</span>
				<span class='text'>These were depicted in the''New System of Chemical Philosophy'', where Dalton listed twenty elements and seventeen simple molecules</span>
				<span class='text'>==Other investigations===Dalton published papers on such diverse topics as rain and dew and the origin of springs (hydrosphere); on heat, the color of the sky, steam, and the [[Specular reflection|reflection]] and [[refraction]] of light; and on the grammatical subjects of the [[auxiliary verb]]s and [[participle]]s of the English language</span>
				<span class='text'>==Experimental approach===As an investigator, Dalton was often content with rough and [[accuracy and precision|inaccurate]] instruments, even though better ones were obtainable</span>
				<span class='text'>Sir [[Humphry Davy]] described him as &quot;a very coarse experimenter&quot;, who almost always found the results he required, trusting to his head rather than his hands</span>
				<span class='text'>On the other hand, historians who have replicated some of his crucial experiments have confirmed Dalton's skill and precision</span>
				<span class='text'>n the preface to the second part of Volume I of his ''New System'', he says he had so often been misled by taking for granted the results of others that he determined to write &quot;as little as possible but what I can attest by my own experience&quot;, but this independence he carried so far that it sometimes resembled lack of receptivity</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus he distrusted, and probably never fully accepted, [[Gay-Lussac]]'s conclusions as to the combining volumes of gases</span>
				<span class='text'>e held unconventional views on [[chlorine]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Even after its elementary character had been settled by Davy, he persisted in using the atomic weights he himself had adopted, even when they had been superseded by the more accurate determinations of other chemists</span>
				<span class='text'>e always objected to the chemical notation devised by [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius]], although most thought that it was much simpler and more convenient than his own cumbersome system of circular symbols</span>
				<span class='text'>=Other publications==For ''[[Rees's Cyclopædia]]'' Dalton contributed articles on Chemistry and Meteorology, but the topics are not known</span>
				<span class='text'>e contributed 117 ''Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester'', from 1817 until his death in 1840, while president of that organization</span>
				<span class='text'>Of these the earlier are the most important</span>
				<span class='text'>In one of them, read in 1814, he explains the principles of [[volumetric analysis]], in which he was one of the earliest workers</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1840 a paper on the [[phosphate]]s and [[arsenic|arsenate]]s, often regarded as a weaker work, was refused by the [[Royal Society]], and he was so incensed that he published it himself</span>
				<span class='text'>He took the same course soon afterwards with four other papers, two of which (''On the quantity of [[acid]]s, [[Base (chemistry)|base]]s and salts in different varieties of salts'' and ''On a new and easy method of analysing sugar'') contain his discovery, regarded by him as second in importance only to the atomic theory, that certain [[anhydrate]]s, when dissolved in water, cause no increase in its volume, his inference being that the salt enters into the pores of the water</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1803, he was chosen to give a course of lectures on natural philosophy at the [[Royal Institution]] in London, and he delivered another course of lectures there in 1809–1810</span>
				<span class='text'>However, some witnesses reported that he was deficient in the qualities that make an attractive lecturer, being harsh and indistinct in voice, ineffective in the treatment of his subject, and singularly wanting in the language and power of illustration</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1810, Sir Humphry Davy asked him to offer himself as a candidate for the [[fellowship of the Royal Society]], but Dalton declined, possibly for financial reasons</span>
				<span class='text'>However, in 1822 he was proposed without his knowledge, and on election paid the usual fee</span>
				<span class='text'>Six years previously he had been made a corresponding member of the French [[Académie des Sciences]], and in 1830 he was elected as one of its eight foreign associates in place of Davy</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1833, at age 67 [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Earl Grey]]'s government conferred on him a pension of [[GBP|£]]150, raised in 1836 to £300</span>
