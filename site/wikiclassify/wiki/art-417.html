				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|Origen reportedly studied under [[Clement of Alexandria]] and was influenced by his thought</span>
				<span class='text'>]Origen was born in [[Alexandria]] to Christian parents</span>
				<span class='text'>He was educated by his father, [[Leonides of Alexandria]], who gave him a standard Hellenistic education, but also had him study the Christian scriptures</span>
				<span class='text'>The name of his mother is unknown</span>
				<span class='text'>n 202, Origen's father was martyred in the outbreak of the [[persecution of Christians|persecution]] during the reign of [[Septimius Severus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>A story reported by Eusebius has it that Origen wished to follow him in martyrdom, but was prevented only by his mother hiding his clothes</span>
				<span class='text'>The death of Leonides left the family of nine impoverished when their property was confiscated</span>
				<span class='text'>Origen, however, was taken under the protection of a woman of wealth and standing; but as her household already included a heretic named Paul, the strictly orthodox Origen seems to have remained with her only a short time</span>
				<span class='text'>[Eusebius]], our chief witness to Origen's life, says that in 203 Origen revived the [[Catechetical School of Alexandria]] where [[Clement of Alexandria]] had once taught but had apparently been driven out during the persecution under Severus</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Many modern scholars,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Joseph|last=Trigg|title=Origen |publisher=Routledge |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, doubt that Clement's school had been an official ecclesiastical institution as Origen's was and thus deny continuity between the two</span>
				<span class='text'>But the persecution still raged, and the young teacher visited imprisoned Christians, attended the courts, and comforted the condemned, himself preserved from persecution because the persecution was probably limited only to converts to Christianity</span>
				<span class='text'>His fame and the number of his pupils increased rapidly, so that Bishop [[Pope Demetrius I of Alexandria|Demetrius of Alexandria]], made him restrict himself to instruction in Christian doctrine alone</span>
				<span class='text'>==Asceticism and castration===Origen, to be entirely independent, sold his library for a sum which netted him a daily income of 4 [[Obolus|obols]], on which he lived by exercising the utmost frugality</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gibbon asserts that, at least initially, rather than generating censure, Origen's self-castration was the focus of admiration, and dryly observes that &quot;As it was his general practice to allegorise scripture, it seems unfortunate that, in this instance only, he should have adopted the literal sense</span>

				<span class='text'>The 1903 Catholic Encyclopedia does not report this</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Henry Chadwick points out that, while the story may be true, it seems unlikely, given that Origen's exposition of Matthew 19:12 &quot;strongly deplored any literal interpretation of the words&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Henry Chadwick, ''The Penguin History of the Church: The Early Church,'' (New York: Penguin Books, 1993) 108-109</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Perhaps Eusebius was uncritically reporting malicious gossip retailed by Origen's enemies, of whom there were many</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt; However, many noted historians, such as [[Peter Brown (historian)|Peter Brown]] and [[William Placher]], continue to find no reason to deny the truth of Eusebius' claims</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[William Placher]], ''A History of Christian Theology: An Introduction,'' (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1983), p62</span>
				<span class='text'>Placher theorises that if it is true, it may have followed an episode in which Origen received some raised eyebrows while privately tutoring a woman</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Travels===During the reign of emperor [[Caracalla]], about 211–212, Origen paid a brief visit to [[Rome]], but the relative laxity during the pontificate of [[Pope Zephyrinus|Zephyrinus]] seems to have disillusioned him, and on his return to Alexandria he resumed his teaching with zeal increased by the contrast</span>
				<span class='text'>But the school had far outgrown the strength of a single man; the catechumens pressed eagerly for elementary instruction, and the baptized sought for interpretation of the Bible</span>
				<span class='text'>Under these circumstances, Origen entrusted the teaching of the catechumens to [[Pope Heraclas of Alexandria|Heraclas]], the brother of the martyr Plutarch, his first pupil</span>
				<span class='text'>is own interests became more and more centered in [[exegesis]], and he accordingly studied [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], though there is no certain knowledge concerning his instructor in that language</span>
				<span class='text'>From about this period (212–213) dates Origen's acquaintance with [[Ambrose of Alexandria]], whom he was instrumental in converting from [[Valentinius|Valentinianism]] to orthodoxy</span>
				<span class='text'>Later (about 218) Ambrose, a man of wealth, made a formal agreement with Origen to promulgate his writings, and all the subsequent works of Origen (except his sermons, which were not expressly prepared for publication) were dedicated to Ambrose</span>
				<span class='text'>n 213 or 214, Origen visited Arabia at the request of the prefect, who wished to have an interview with him; and Origen accordingly spent a brief time in [[Petra]], after which he returned to Alexandria</span>
				<span class='text'>In the following year, a popular uprising at Alexandria caused Caracalla to let his soldiers plunder the city, shut the schools, and expel all foreigners</span>
				<span class='text'>The latter measure caused Ambrose to take refuge in [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]], where he seems to have made his permanent home; and Origen left Egypt, apparently going with Ambrose to Caesarea, where he spent some time</span>
				<span class='text'>Here, in conformity with local usage based on Jewish custom, Origen, though not ordained, preached and interpreted the scriptures at the request of the bishops Alexander of Jerusalem and Theoctistus of Caesarea</span>
				<span class='text'>When, however, the confusion in Alexandria subsided, Demetrius recalled Origen, probably in 216</span>
				<span class='text'>f Origen's activity during the next decade little is known, but it was probably devoted to teaching and writing</span>
				<span class='text'>The latter was rendered the more easy for him by Ambrose, who provided him with more than seven stenographers to take dictation in relays, as many scribes to prepare long-hand copies, and a number of girls to multiply the copies</span>
				<span class='text'>At the request of Ambrose, he now began a huge commentary on the ''Bible'', beginning with John, and continuing with [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], [[Psalms]] 1–25, and [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]], besides brief exegeses of selected texts (forming the ten books of his ''Stromateis''), two books on the [[resurrection]], and the work ''On First Principles''</span>
				<span class='text'>==Conflict with Demetrius and removal to Caesarea===Demetrius, the bishop of Alexandria, at first supported Origen but later opposed him, disputing his [[ordination]] in another [[diocese]] ([[Caesarea Maritima]] in Palestine)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[Eusebius]], ''Church History'', VI</span>

				<span class='text'>rg/fathers/250106</span>
				<span class='text'>tm Eusebius - Church History (Book VI)]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This ecclesiastical turmoil eventually caused Origen to move to Caesarea, a move which he characterized as [[The Exodus|divine deliverance from Egypt]] akin to that the ancient Hebrews received</span>
				<span class='text'>About 230, Origen entered on the fateful journey which was to compel him to give up his work at Alexandria and embittered the next years of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>Sent to [[Greece]] on some ecclesiastical mission, he paid a visit to Caesarea, where he was heartily welcomed and was ordained a priest, that no further cause for criticism might be given Demetrius, who had strongly disapproved his preaching before ordination while at Caesarea</span>
				<span class='text'>But Demetrius, taking this well-meant act as an infringement of his rights, was furious, for not only was Origen under his jurisdiction as bishop of Alexandria, but, if Eastern sources may be believed, Demetrius had been the first to introduce episcopal ordination in Egypt</span>
				<span class='text'>The metropolitan accordingly convened a synod of bishops and presbyters which banished Origen from Alexandria, while a second synod declared his ordination invalid</span>
				<span class='text'>rigen accordingly fled from Alexandria in 231–2, and made his permanent home in Caesarea in Palestine, where his friend Theoctistus was bishop</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' VI</span>
				<span class='text'>6&lt;/ref&gt; A series of attacks on him seems to have emanated from Alexandria, whether for his self-castration (a capital crime in Roman law) or for alleged [[heterodoxy]] is unknown; but at all events these fulminations were heeded only at Rome, while Palestine, Phoenicia, Arabia, and Achaia paid no attention to them</span>
				<span class='text'>At Alexandria, Heraclas became head of Origen's school, and shortly afterward, on the death of Demetrius, was consecrated bishop</span>
				<span class='text'>uring this time at Caesarea in Palestine (232–5), he resumed work on the ''Commentary on John'', composing at least books 6-10, wrote the treatise ''On Prayer'', and, some time in the first half of the year 235, composed his ''Exhortation to Martyrdom''</span>

				<span class='text'>122&lt;/ref&gt; Eusebius reports that he was summoned from there to Antioch at the behest of the empress mother [[Julia Avita Mamaea]] &quot;to discuss Christian philosophy and doctrine with her</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;From ''The Emergence of Christianity'', Cynthia White, Greenwood Press, 2007, p</span>
				<span class='text'>14</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Approximately three years after his arrival in Caesarea in Palestine, Origen's life as a scholar was again interrupted by the persecution of [[Maximinus Thrax]] (235-8)</span>
				<span class='text'>He took refuge at Caesarea in Cappadocia</span>
				<span class='text'>At Caesarea, Origen was joyfully received and was the guest of [[Firmilian]], bishop of [[Caesarea Cappadociae|Caesarea in Cappadocia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>fter the death of Maximinus, Origen resumed his life in Caesarea of Palestine</span>
				<span class='text'>Little is known of the last twenty years of Origen's life</span>
				<span class='text'>He founded a school where Gregory Thaumaturgus, later bishop of Pontus, was one of the pupils</span>
				<span class='text'>He preached regularly on Wednesdays and Fridays, and later daily</span>
				<span class='text'>He taught [[dialectic]]s, [[physics]], [[ethics]], and [[metaphysics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He evidently, however, developed an extraordinary literary productivity, broken by occasional journeys; one of which, to Athens during some unknown year, was of sufficient length to allow him time for research</span>
				<span class='text'>fter his return from Athens, he succeeded in converting Beryllus, bishop of Bostra, from his [[adoptionism|adoptionistic]] (i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> belief that Jesus was born human and only became divine after his baptism) views to the orthodox faith; yet in these very years (about 240) probably occurred the attacks on Origen's own orthodoxy which compelled him to defend himself in writing to [[Pope Fabian]] and many bishops</span>
				<span class='text'>Neither the source nor the object of these attacks is known, though the latter may have been connected with [[Novatianism]] (a strict refusal to accept Christians who had denied their faith under persecution)</span>
				<span class='text'>fter his conversion of Beryllus, however, his aid was frequently invoked against heresies</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, when the doctrine was promulgated in Arabia that the soul died and decayed with the body, being restored to life only at the resurrection (see [[soul sleep]]), appeal was made to Origen, who journeyed to Arabia, and successfully battled this doctrine</span>
				<span class='text'>here was second outbreak of the [[Antonine Plague]], which at its height in 251 to 266 took the lives of 5,000 a day in Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>This time it was called the [[Plague of Cyprian]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Emperor [[Decius]], believing the plague to be a product of magic, caused by the failure of Christians to recognize him as Divine, began Christian persecutions</span>

				<span class='text'>For instance, he was the greatest [[textual criticism|textual critic]] of the early Church, directing the production of the massive ''[[Hexapla]]'' (&quot;Sixfold&quot;), an [[Old Testament]] in six columns: [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], Hebrew in Greek characters, the [[Septuagint]], and the Greek versions of [[Theodotion]], [[Aquila of Sinope]], and [[Symmachus (translator)|Symmachus]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the greatest biblical scholars of the early Church, having written commentaries on most of the books of the [[Bible]], though few are extant</span>
				<span class='text'>He interpreted scripture both literally and [[allegorical interpretation of the Bible|allegorically]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Origen was largely responsible for the collection of usage information regarding the texts which became the [[New Testament]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The information used to create the late-fourth-century [[Easter Letter]], which declared accepted Christian writings, was probably based on the ''Ecclesiastical History'' [HE] of [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], wherein he uses the information passed on to him by Origen to create both his list at HE 3:25 and Origen’s list at HE 6:25</span>
				<span class='text'>Eusebius got his information about what texts were accepted by the third-century churches throughout the known world, a great deal of which Origen knew of firsthand from his extensive travels, from the library and writings of Origen</span>

				<span class='text'> lxiv</span>
				<span class='text'>3&lt;/ref&gt; Origen wrote about 6,000 works (''i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>', rolls or chapters)</span>
				<span class='text'>A list was given by [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]] in his lost ''Life of Pamphilus'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'', VI</span>
				<span class='text'> xxxii</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Epist</span>
				<span class='text'>ad Paulam, NPNF'', vi</span>
				<span class='text'>46&lt;/ref&gt; These fall into four classes: [[textual criticism]]; exegesis; systematic, practical, and apologetic theology; and [[Letter (message)|letters]]; besides certain spurious works</span>
				<span class='text'>y far the most important work of Origen on textual criticism was the ''[[Hexapla]]'', a comparative study of various translations of the Old Testament</span>
				<span class='text'>he full text of the ''Hexapla'' is no longer extant</span>
				<span class='text'>Some portions were discovered in [[Milan]] indicating that at least some individual parts existed much longer than was previously thought</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''Hexapla'' has been referred to by later manuscripts and authors, and represented the precursor to the parallel bible</span>
				<span class='text'>he ''Tetrapla'' was an abbreviation of the ''Hexapla'' in which Origen placed only the translations (Aquila, Symmachus, Theodotion, and the [[Septuagint]]) in parallels</span>
				<span class='text'>e was likewise keenly conscious of the textual difficulties in the manuscripts of the New Testament, although he never wrote definitely on this subject</span>
				<span class='text'>In his exegetical writings he frequently alludes to the variant readings, but his habit of making rough citations in his dictation, the verification being left to the scribes, renders it impossible to deduce his text from his commentaries</span>
				<span class='text'>he exegetical writings of Origen fall into three classes:*scholia, or brief summaries of the meaning of difficult passages*[[homilies]]*&quot;books&quot;, or commentaries in the strict sense of the term</span>
				<span class='text'>erome states that there were scholia on Leviticus, Psalms i</span>
				<span class='text'>xv</span>
				<span class='text'> Ecclesiastes, Isaiah, and part of John</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''Stromateis'' were of a similar character, and the margin of ''Codex Athous Laura'', 184, contains citations from this work on Rom</span>
				<span class='text'>9:23; I Cor</span>
				<span class='text'>6:14, 7:31, 34, 9:20-21, 10:9, besides a few other fragments</span>
				<span class='text'>omilies on almost the entire Bible were prepared by Origen</span>
				<span class='text'>There are 205, and possibly 279, homilies of Origen that are extant either in Greek or in Latin translations</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;The discrepancy concerns the 74 homilies on the Psalms attributed to Jerome, but which V Peri has argued Jerome translated from Origen with only minor changes</span>
				<span class='text'>(Both 205 and 279 exclude the 2012 discoveries) Ronald E Heine, 'The Alexandrians', in Frances Young et al, eds, ''The Cambridge History of Early Christian Literature'', (2010), p124</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The homilies preserved are on Genesis (16), Exodus (13), Leviticus (16), Numbers (28), Joshua (26), Judges (9), I Sam</span>
				<span class='text'>(2), Psalms 36-38 (9),&lt;ref&gt;And possibly the extra 74 homilies on the Psalms</span>
				<span class='text'>Ronald E Heine, 'The Alexandrians', in Frances Young et al, eds, ''The Cambridge History of Early Christian Literature'', (2010), p124</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Canticles (2), Isaiah (9), Jeremiah (7 Greek, 2 Latin, 12 Greek and Latin), Ezekiel (14), and Luke (39)</span>
				<span class='text'>The homilies were preached in the church at Caesarea, with the exception of the two on 1 Samuel which were delivered in Jerusalem</span>
				<span class='text'>Nautin has argued that they were all preached in a three-year liturgical cycle some time between 238 and 244, preceding the ''Commentary on the Song of Songs'', where Origen refers to homilies on Judges, Exodus, Numbers, and a work on Leviticus</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ronald E Heine, 'The Alexandrians', in Frances Young et al, eds, ''The Cambridge History of Early Christian Literature'', (2010), p125&lt;/ref&gt;It is not improbable that Origen gave no attention to supervising the publication of his homilies, for only by such a hypothesis can the numerous evidences of carelessness in diction be explained</span>
				<span class='text'>The exegesis of the homilies was simpler than that of the scientific commentaries, but nevertheless demanded no mean degree of intelligence from the auditor</span>
				<span class='text'>Origen's chief aim was the practical exposition of the text, verse by verse; and while in such books as Leviticus and Numbers he sought to allegorize, the wealth of material in the prophets seldom rendered it necessary for him to seek meanings deeper than the surface afforded</span>
				<span class='text'>n June 11, 2012, the Bavarian National Library announced the discovery by philologist Marina Molin Pradel of unknown original texts of homilies by Origenes in a twelfth-century Greek manuscript</span>

				<span class='text'>At the same time, he neglected neither philological nor geographical, historical nor antiquarian material, to all of which he devoted numerous excursus</span>
				<span class='text'>n his commentary on John he constantly considered the exegesis of the Valentinian Heracleon (probably at the insistence of Ambrose), and in many other places he implied or expressly cited Gnostic views and refuted them</span>

				<span class='text'>He also noted his intention to 'abbreviate' the work</span>
				<span class='text'>Rufinus' abbreviated Latin version in ten books is extant</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Codex Athous Laura 184 gives the division of the fifteen books of the commentary on Romans (except XI and XII) and of the five books on Galatians, as well as the extent of the commentaries on Philippians and Corinthians (Romans I from 1:1 to 1:7; II from 1:8 to 1:25; III from 1:26 to 2:11; IV from 2:12 to 3:15; V from 3:16 to 3:31; VI from 4:1 to 5:7; VII from 5:8 to 5:16; VIII from 5:17 to 6:15; IX from 6:16 to 8:8; X from 8:9 to 8:39; XIII from 11:13 to 12:15; XIV from 12:16 to 14:10; XV from 14:11 to the end; Galatians I from 1:1 to 2:2; II from 2:3 to 3:4; III from 3:5 to 4:5; IV from 4:6 to 5:5; and V from 5:6 to 6:18; the commentary on Philippians extended to 4:1; and on Ephesians to 4:13)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Dogmatic, practical, and apologetic writings===Study of ''On First Principles'' has occupied centre stage in studies of Origen since the fourth century</span>
				<span class='text'>It is perhaps written for his more advanced pupils at Alexandria and probably composed between 212 and 215</span>
				<span class='text'>It is extant only in the free translation of Rufinus of 397,&lt;ref&gt;Rufinus was convinced, as he states in his preface, that the work had been interpolated by heretics</span>
				<span class='text'>He, therefore, either omitted objectionable passages concerning the Trinity, or corrected them on the basis of what he found in Origen's other writings</span>
				<span class='text'>Ronald E Heine, 'The Alexandrians', in Frances Young et al, eds, ''The Cambridge History of Early Christian Literature'', (2010), p125&lt;/ref&gt; except for fragments (books 3</span>
				<span class='text'> and 4</span>
				<span class='text'>-3) preserved in ''[[Origen's Philocalia]]'', and smaller citations in Justinian's letter to Mennas</span>
				<span class='text'>n the first book the author considers [[God]], the [[Logos]], the Holy Ghost, reason, and the angels; in the second the world and man (including the incarnation of the Logos, the soul, free will, and eschatology); in the third, the doctrine of sin and redemption; and in the fourth, the scriptures; the whole being concluded with a résumé of the entire system</span>
				<span class='text'>The work is noteworthy as the first endeavor to present Christianity as a complete theory of the universe, and was designed to remove the difficulties felt by many Christians concerning the essential basis of their faith</span>
				<span class='text'>etween 232-235, while in Caesarea in Palestine, Origen wrote ''On Prayer''</span>
				<span class='text'>This is preserved entire in Greek</span>
				<span class='text'>After an introduction on the object, necessity, and advantage of [[prayer]], ends with an exegesis of the Lord's Prayer, concluding with remarks on the position, place, and attitude to be assumed during prayer, as well as on the classes of prayer</span>
				<span class='text'>'On Martyrdom'', or the ''Exhortation to Martyrdom'', also preserved entire in Greek, was written some time after the beginning of the persecution of [[Maximinus Thrax|Maximinus]] in the first half of 235</span>
				<span class='text'>In it, Origen warns against any trifling with idolatry and emphasizes the duty of suffering martyrdom manfully; while in the second part he explains the meaning of martyrdom</span>
				<span class='text'>'[[Contra Celsum|Against Celsus]]'' (Greek: Κατὰ Κέλσου; Latin: ''Contra Celsum''), preserved entire in Greek, was Origen's last treatise, written about 248</span>
				<span class='text'>Ambrose had requested that Origen provide an answer to a book entitled ''The True Doctrine'' which attacked Christianity, and had been written some time in the second century by an unknown Middle Platonic philosopher named [[Celsus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Celsus charged that Jesus was a deceptive magician who did miracles by a magic occult power not by a relationship with the divine</span>
				<span class='text'>In the ancient world few doubted strange powers existed and were used</span>

				<span class='text'>Dodds]], ''The Greeks and the Irrational</span>
				<span class='text'>'&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Against Celsus'', Origen drew freely on the Greek philosophers and poets as well as the Bible to provide a rational basis for holding the Christian faith</span>

				<span class='text'>Neither work can be dated precisely, though both were probably written after the persecution of Maximinus in 235</span>
				<span class='text'>One is ''On the Pascha''</span>
				<span class='text'>The other is ''Dialogue of Origen with Heraclides and the Bishops with him concerning the Father and the Son and the soul''</span>

				<span class='text'>Except for a few fragments, only three letters have been preserved</span>
				<span class='text'>The first, partly preserved in the Latin translation of Rufinus, is addressed to friends in Alexandria</span>

				<span class='text'>The third is an epistle to [[Sextus Julius Africanus]], extant in Greek, replying to a letter from Africanus (also extant), and defending the authenticity of the Greek additions to the book of Daniel</span>
				<span class='text'>orgeries of the writings of Origen made in his lifetime are discussed by Rufinus in ''De adulteratione librorum Origenis''</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''Dialogus de recta in Deum fide'', the ''[[Philosophumena]]'' attributed to [[Hippolytus of Rome]], and the ''Commentary on Job'' by Julian the Arian have also been ascribed to him</span>
				<span class='text'>=Views=={{Refimprove section|date=May 2007}}===Philosophical and religious==={{Platonism}}Origen, reportedly trained in the school of Clement and by his father, has long been considered essentially a [[Platonism|Platonist]] with occasional traces of [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>Patristic scholar Mark J Edwards has argued that many of Origen's positions are more properly [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] than strictly Platonic (for instance, his philosophical anthropology)</span>
				<span class='text'>Nonetheless, he was thus a pronounced idealist, as one regarding all things temporal and material as insignificant and indifferent, the only real and eternal things being comprised in the idea</span>
				<span class='text'>He therefore regards as the purely ideal center of this spiritual and eternal world, God, the pure reason, whose creative powers call into being the world with matter as the necessary substratum</span>
				<span class='text'>rigen's cosmology is complicated and controverted, but he seems to have held to a hypothesis of the preexistence of souls</span>
				<span class='text'>Before the known world was created by God, he created a great number of spiritual intelligences</span>
				<span class='text'>At first devoted to the contemplation and love of their creator, almost all of these intelligences eventually grew bored of contemplating God, and their love for him cooled off</span>
				<span class='text'>Those whose love for God diminished the most became [[demons]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Those whose love diminished moderately became human souls, eventually to be incarnated in fleshly bodies</span>
				<span class='text'>Those whose love diminished the least became [[angels]]</span>
				<span class='text'>One, however, who remained perfectly devoted to God became, through love, one with the Word ([[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]]) of God</span>
				<span class='text'>The Logos eventually took flesh and was born of the [[Virgin Mary]], becoming the God-man [[Jesus Christ]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The diverse conditions in which human beings are born is actually dependent upon what their souls did in this [[Pre-existence|pre-existent]] state</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus what seems unfair, some being born poor and others wealthy, some sick and others healthy, and so forth, is, Origen insists, actually in a by-product of the free-will of souls</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, material creation is at least implicitly of a lesser ontological category than the immaterial, or spiritual, and the heavy material bodies that man assumes after the fall will eventually be cast off</span>
				<span class='text'>Origen, however, still insisted on a bodily resurrection, but in contrast to Athenagoras, who believed that earthly bodies would be precisely reconstituted in the hereafter, Origen argued that Paul's notion of a flourishing spiritual body is more appropriate</span>
				<span class='text'>e was a rigid adherent of scripture, making no statement without adducing some scriptural basis</span>
				<span class='text'>To him the scriptures were divinely inspired, as was proved both by the fulfillment of [[prophecy]] and by the immediate impression which the scriptures made on those who read them</span>
				<span class='text'>Since the divine Logos spoke in the scriptures, they were an organic whole and on every occasion he combatted the Gnostic tenet of the inferiority of the Old Testament</span>
				<span class='text'>n his exegesis, Origen sought to discover the deeper meaning implied in the scriptures</span>
				<span class='text'>One of his chief methods was the translation of proper names, which enabled him, like [[Philo]], to find a deep meaning even in every event of history (see [[hermeneutics]]), but at the same time he insisted on an exact grammatical interpretation of the text as the basis of all exegesis</span>
				<span class='text'> strict adherent of the Church, Origen yet distinguished sharply between the ideal and the empirical Church, representing &quot;a double church of men and angels&quot;,&lt;ref name=Schaff&gt;{{cite book|last=Schaff|first=Philip|title=The new Schaff-Herzog encyclopedia of religious knowledge: embracing biblical, historical, doctrinal, and practical theology and biblical, theological, and ecclesiastical biography from the earliest times to the present day|year=1910|publisher=Funk and Wagnalls Company|page=272|url=https://books</span>

				<span class='text'>The ideal Church alone was the Church of Christ, scattered over all the earth; the other provided also a shelter for sinners</span>
				<span class='text'>Holding that the Church, as being in possession of the mysteries, affords the only means of salvation, he was indifferent to her external organization,&lt;ref name=Schaff /&gt; although he spoke sometimes of the office-bearers as the pillars of the Church, and of their heavy duties and responsibilities</span>
				<span class='text'>ore important to him was the idea borrowed from Plato of the grand division between the great human multitude, capable of sensual vision only, and those who know how to comprehend the hidden meaning of scripture and the diverse mysteries, church organization being for the former only</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Schaff /&gt;It is doubtful whether Origen possessed an obligatory creed; at any rate, such a confession of faith was not a norm like the inspired word of scripture</span>
				<span class='text'>The reason, illumined by the divine Logos, which is able to search the secret depths of the divine nature, remains as the only source of knowledge</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Schaff /&gt;===Theological and dogmatic===Origen's conception of God the Father is apophatic—a perfect unity, invisible and incorporeal, transcending all things material, and therefore inconceivable and incomprehensible</span>
				<span class='text'>He is likewise unchangeable, and transcends space and time</span>
				<span class='text'>But his power is limited by his goodness, justice, and wisdom; and, though entirely free from necessity, his goodness and omnipotence constrained him to reveal himself</span>
				<span class='text'>his revelation, the external self-emanation of God, is expressed by Origen in various ways, the Logos being only one of many</span>

				<span class='text'>Since God eternally manifests himself, the Logos is likewise eternal</span>
				<span class='text'>He forms a bridge between the created and uncreated, and only through him, as the visible representative of divine wisdom, can the inconceivable and incorporeal God be known</span>
				<span class='text'>Creation came into existence only through the Logos, and God's nearest approach to the world is the command to create</span>
				<span class='text'>While the Logos is substantially a unity, he comprehends a multiplicity of concepts, so that Origen terms him, in Platonic fashion, &quot;essence of essences&quot; and &quot;idea of ideas&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>His first creative act was the divine spirit, as an independent existence; and partial reflexes of the Logos were the created rational beings, who, as they had to revert to the perfect God as their background, must likewise be perfect; yet their perfection, unlike in kind with that of God, the Logos, and the divine spirit, had to be attained</span>
				<span class='text'>The freedom of the will is an essential fact of the reason, notwithstanding the foreknowledge of God</span>
				<span class='text'>The Logos, eternally creative, forms an endless series of finite, comprehensible worlds, which are mutually alternative</span>
				<span class='text'>Combining the Stoic doctrine of a universe without beginning with the biblical doctrine of the beginning and the end of the world, he conceived of the visible world as the stages of an eternal cosmic process, affording also an explanation of the diversity of human fortunes, rewards, and punishments</span>
				<span class='text'>The material world, which at first had no place in this eternal spiritual progression, was due to the fall of the spirits from God, the first being the serpent, who was imprisoned in matter and body</span>
				<span class='text'>The ultimate aim of God in the creation of matter out of nothing was not punishment, but the upraising of the fallen spirits</span>
				<span class='text'>Man's accidental being is rooted in transitory matter, but his higher nature is formed in the image of the Creator</span>
				<span class='text'>The soul is divided into the rational and the irrational, the latter being material and transitory, while the former, incorporeal and immaterial, possesses freedom of the will and the power to reascend to purer life</span>
				<span class='text'> The strong ethical import of this cosmic process can not remain unnoticed</span>
				<span class='text'>The return to original being through divine reason is the object of the entire cosmic process</span>
				<span class='text'>Through the worlds which follow each other in eternal succession, the spirits are able to return to Paradise</span>
				<span class='text'>God so ordered the universe that all individual acts work together toward one cosmic end which culminates in himself</span>
				<span class='text'>Likewise as to Origen's anthropology, man conceived in the image of God is able by imitating God in good works to become like God, if he first recognizes his own weakness and trusts all to the divine goodness</span>
				<span class='text'>He is aided by [[guardian angel]]s, but more especially by the Logos who operates through saints and prophets in proportion to the constitution of these and man's capacity</span>
				<span class='text'>==Christology===The culmination of this gradual revelation is the universal revelation of Christ</span>
				<span class='text'>In Christ, God, hitherto manifest only as the Lord, appeared as the Father</span>
				<span class='text'>The incarnation of the Logos, moreover, was necessary since otherwise he would not be intelligible to sensual man; but the indwelling of the Logos remained a mystery, which could be represented only by the analogy of his indwelling in the saints; nor could Origen fully explain it</span>
				<span class='text'>He speaks of a &quot;remarkable body&quot;, and in his opinion that the mortal body of Jesus was transformed by God into an ethereal and divine body, Origen approximated the [[Docetism]] that he otherwise abhorred</span>
				<span class='text'>His concept of the soul of Jesus is likewise uncertain and wavering</span>
				<span class='text'>He proposes the question whether it was not originally perfect with God but, emanating from him, at his command assumed a material body</span>
				<span class='text'>As he conceived matter as merely the universal limit of created spirits, so would it be impossible to state in what form the two were combined</span>
				<span class='text'>He dismissed the solution by referring it to the mystery of the divine governance of the universe</span>
				<span class='text'>More logically did he declare the material nature of the world to be merely an episode in the spiritual process of development, whose end should be the annihilation of all matter and return to God, who should again be all in all</span>
				<span class='text'>The doctrine of the resurrection of the body he upholds by the explanation that the Logos maintains the unity of man's existence by ever changing his body into new forms, thus preserving the unity and identity of personality in harmony with the tenet of an endless cosmic process</span>
				<span class='text'>Origen's concept of the Logos allowed him to make no definite statement on the redemptive work of Jesus</span>
				<span class='text'>Since sin was ultimately only negative as a lack of pure knowledge, the activity of Jesus was essentially example and instruction, and his human life was only incidental as contrasted with the immanent cosmic activity of the Logos</span>
				<span class='text'>Origen regarded the death of Jesus as a sacrifice, paralleling it with other cases of self-sacrifice for the general good</span>
				<span class='text'>On this, Origen's accord with the teachings of the Church was merely superficial</span>

				<span class='text'>Origen believes that all spirits will be finally rescued and glorified, each in the form of its individual life, in order to serve a new epoch of the world when sensuous matter disappears of itself</span>

				<span class='text'>The means of attainment of this end were described by Origen in different ways, the most important of which was his concept of a purifying fire which should cleanse the world of evil and thus lead to cosmic renovation</span>
				<span class='text'>By a further spiritualization Origen could call God himself this consuming fire</span>
				<span class='text'>In proportion as the souls were freed from sin and ignorance, the material world was to pass away, until, after endless eons, at the final end, God should be all in all, and the worlds and spirits should return to a knowledge of God; in Greek this is called [[Apokatastasis]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Many theologians share the notion that Origen's extant works from Latin translations (not from the original Greek) confirm he did not believe in reincarnation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;For example, compare [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume IX/Origen on Matthew/Origen's Commentary on Matthew/Book XIII/Chapter 1|On Mathew, Ch</span>
				<span class='text'>]]&lt;/ref&gt; He was cognizant of the concept of transmigration (''metensomatosis'' transformation, and loses what it once was, the human soul will not be what it was)&lt;ref&gt;Cf</span>
				<span class='text'>Tertullian, [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume III/Apologetic/A Treatise on the Soul/Chapter XXXII|A Treatise on the Soul, Ch</span>
				<span class='text'>XXII]]&lt;/ref&gt; from Greek philosophy, but it is repeatedly stated that this concept is not a part of the Christian teaching or scripture</span>
				<span class='text'>A translation of his ''Commentary on the [[Gospel of Matthew]]'', which stems from a 6th-century Latin translation, reads: &quot;In this place [when Jesus said Elijah was come and referred to John the Baptist] it does not appear to me that by Elijah the soul is spoken of, lest I fall into the doctrine of [[Reincarnation|transmigration]], which is foreign to the Church of God, and not handed down by the apostles, nor anywhere set forth in the scriptures&quot; (ibid</span>
				<span class='text'> 13:1:46&amp;ndash;53)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume IX/Origen on Matthew/Origen's Commentary on Matthew/Book XIII|Commentary on Matthew, Book XIII]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Conversely in Origen's ''Against Celsus'', he argues that the teaching of the resurrection does not come from the doctrine of reincarnation, yet contradictorily claims to know that the soul transmigrates from body to body:{{Quote|Our teaching on the subject of the resurrection is not, as Celsus imagines, derived from anything that we have heard on the doctrine of [[Reincarnation|metempsychosis]]; but we know that the soul, which is immaterial and invisible in its nature, exists in no material place, without having a body suited to the nature of that place</span>
				<span class='text'> Accordingly, it at one time puts off one body which was necessary before, but which is no longer adequate in its changed state, and it exchanges it for a second; and at another time it assumes another in addition to the former, which is needed as a better covering, suited to the purer ethereal regions of heaven</span>
				<span class='text'> When it comes into the world at birth, it casts off the integuments which it needed in the womb; and before doing this, it puts on another body suited for its life upon earth</span>

				<span class='text'>Jerome writes about Origen in &quot;To Avitus&quot;, conveying the impression that Origen was a heretic like [[Arius]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Concerning Origen's ''On First Principles'', St</span>
				<span class='text'>Jerome warns Avitus &quot;that there are countless things in the book to be abhorred, and that, as the Lord says, you will have to walk among scorpions and serpents&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;To Avitus&quot; /&gt; Further, in &quot;To Avitus&quot; (Letter 124), St</span>
				<span class='text'>Jerome writes about &quot;convincing proof&quot; that Origen teaches reincarnation in the original version of the book:{{Quote|The following passage is a convincing proof that he [Origen] holds the [[Reincarnation|transmigration of the souls]] and annihilation of bodies</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;If it can be shown that an incorporeal and reasonable being has life in itself independently of the body and that it is worse off in the body than out of it; then beyond a doubt bodies are only of secondary importance and arise from time to time to meet the varying conditions of reasonable creatures</span>
				<span class='text'>Those who require bodies are clothed with them, and contrariwise, when fallen souls have lifted themselves up to better things, their bodies are once more annihilated</span>
				<span class='text'>They are thus ever vanishing and ever reappearing</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;To Avitus&quot; /&gt;}}St</span>
				<span class='text'>Jerome further elaborates Origen's ideas in &quot;To Avitus&quot;:{{Quote|Moreover, [Origen writes that] to avoid the agony of punishment and the burning flame the more sensitive may choose to become low organisms, to dwell in water, to assume the shape of this or that animal; so that we have reason to fear a metamorphosis not only into four-footed things but even into fishes</span>
				<span class='text'>Then, lest he [Origen] should be held guilty of maintaining with [[Pythagoras]] the transmigration of souls, he winds up the wicked reasoning with which he has wounded his reader by saying: &quot;I must not be taken to make dogmas of these things; they are only thrown out as conjectures to show that they are not altogether overlooked</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;To Avitus&quot; /&gt;}}St</span>
				<span class='text'>Jerome adds to this:{{Quote|Hellfire, moreover, and the torments with which holy scripture threatens sinners he [Origen] explains not as external punishments but as the pangs of guilty consciences when by God's power the memory of our transgressions is set before our eyes</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;The whole crop of our sins grows up afresh from seeds which remain in the soul, and all our dishonourable and undutiful acts are again pictured before our gaze</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus it is the fire of conscience and the stings of remorse which torture the mind as it looks back on former self-indulgence</span>
