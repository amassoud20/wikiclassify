				<span class='text'>Nasser led the 1952 overthrow of the monarchy and introduced [[Egyptian land reform|far-reaching land reform]]s the following year</span>
				<span class='text'>Following a 1954 [[Muslim Brotherhood]]-led attempt on his life, he cracked down on the organization, put President [[Muhammad Naguib]] under [[house arrest]], and assumed executive office, officially becoming president in [[Egyptian referendum, 1956|June 1956]]</span>
				<span class='text'>asser's nationalization of the [[Suez Canal]] and his emergence as the political victor from the subsequent [[Suez Crisis]] substantially elevated his popularity in Egypt and the Arab world</span>
				<span class='text'>Calls for [[pan-Arabism|pan-Arab unity]] under his leadership increased, culminating with the formation of the [[United Arab Republic]] with [[Syria]] (1958–1961)</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1962, Nasser began a series of major [[socialism|socialist]] measures and modernization reforms in Egypt</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite setbacks to his pan-Arabist cause, by 1963 Nasser's supporters gained power in several Arab countries and he became embroiled in the [[North Yemen Civil War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He began his second presidential term in March 1965 after his political opponents were banned from running</span>
				<span class='text'>Following Egypt's defeat by Israel in the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], Nasser resigned, but he returned to office after popular demonstrations called for his reinstatement</span>
				<span class='text'>By 1968, Nasser had appointed himself prime minister, launched the [[War of Attrition]] to regain lost territory, began a process of depoliticizing the military, and issued a set of political liberalization reforms</span>
				<span class='text'>After the conclusion of the [[1970 Arab League summit]], Nasser suffered a heart attack and died</span>
				<span class='text'>His funeral in [[Cairo]] drew five million mourners and an outpouring of grief across the Arab world</span>
				<span class='text'>asser remains an iconic figure in the Arab world, particularly for his strides towards [[social justice]] and Arab unity, modernization policies, and [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] efforts</span>
				<span class='text'>His [[Nasser era|presidency]] also encouraged and coincided with an Egyptian cultural boom, and launched large industrial projects, including the [[Aswan Dam]] and [[Helwan|Helwan City]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Nasser's detractors criticize his authoritarianism, his government's human rights violations, his [[populism|populist]] relationship with the citizenry, and his failure to establish civil institutions, blaming his legacy for future dictatorial governance in Egypt</span>
				<span class='text'>Historians describe Nasser as a towering political figure of the [[History of the Middle East#Modern Middle East|Middle East]] in the 20th century</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;BibliothecaHoda&quot;/&gt; Nasser was arrested and detained for a night&lt;ref name=&quot;Litvin39&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Litvin|2011|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; before his father bailed him out</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;BibliothecaHoda&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander15&quot;/&gt; On 13 November 1935, Nasser led a student demonstration against British rule, protesting against a statement made four days prior by UK foreign minister [[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood|Samuel Hoare]] that rejected prospects for the 1923 Constitution's restoration</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;BibliothecaHoda&quot;/&gt; Two protesters were killed and Nasser received a graze to the head from a policeman's bullet</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Litvin39&quot;/&gt; The incident garnered his first mention in the press: the nationalist newspaper ''Al Gihad'' reported that Nasser led the protest and was among the wounded</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;BibliothecaHoda&quot;/&gt;Nasser's involvement in political activity increased throughout his school years, such that he only attended 45 days of classes during his last year of secondary school</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;BibliothecaHoda&quot;/&gt; Consequently, political unrest in Egypt declined significantly and Nasser resumed his studies at al-Nahda,&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander19-20&quot;/&gt; where he received his [[leaving certificate]] later that year</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;BibliothecaHoda&quot;/&gt;===Early influences===Aburish asserts that Nasser was not distressed by his frequent relocations, which broadened his horizons and showed him Egyptian society's [[class division]]s</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Talhami|2007|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was especially influenced by Egyptian writer [[Tawfiq al-Hakim]]'s novel ''Return of the Spirit'', in which al-Hakim wrote that the Egyptian people were only in need of a &quot;man in whom all their feelings and desires will be represented, and who will be for them a symbol of their objective&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Litvin39&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander16&quot;/&gt; Nasser later credited the novel as his inspiration to launch the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|1952 revolution]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reid|1981|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; From his readings, Nasser, who frequently spoke of &quot;dignity, glory, and freedom&quot; in his youth,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; became enchanted with the stories of national liberators and heroic conquerors; a military career became his chief priority</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;Convinced that he needed a ''[[wasta]]'', or an influential intermediary to promote his application above the others, Nasser managed to secure a meeting with Under-Secretary of War Ibrahim Khairy Pasha,&lt;ref name=&quot;Aburish15&quot;/&gt; the person responsible for the academy's selection board, and requested his help</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander20&quot;/&gt; Khairy Pasha agreed and sponsored Nasser's second application,&lt;ref name=&quot;Aburish15&quot;/&gt; which was accepted in late 1937</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Aburish27&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its success and evident popular support among the Syrian people encouraged Nasser's revolutionary pursuits</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Aburish27&quot;/&gt; Soon after his return, he was summoned and interrogated by Prime Minister [[Ibrahim Abdel Hadi]] regarding suspicions that he was forming a secret group of dissenting officers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Aburish27&quot;/&gt; According to secondhand reports, Nasser convincingly denied the allegations</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Aburish27&quot;/&gt; Abdel Hadi was also hesitant to take drastic measures against the army, especially in front of its chief of staff, who was present during the interrogation, and subsequently released Nasser</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Aburish27&quot;/&gt; The interrogation pushed Nasser to speed up his group's activities</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Aburish27&quot;/&gt;After 1949, the group adopted the name &quot;[[Free Officers Movement (Egypt)|Association of Free Officers]]&quot; and advocated &quot;little else but freedom and the restoration of their country’s dignity&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Heikal17&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Heikal|1973|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasser organized the Free Officers' founding committee, which eventually comprised fourteen men from different social and political backgrounds, including representation from Young Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood, the Egyptian Communist Party, and the aristocracy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Aburish27&quot;/&gt; Nasser was unanimously elected chairman of the organization</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Aburish27&quot;/&gt;In the 1950 parliamentary elections, the [[Wafd Party]] of el-Nahhas gained a victory—mostly due to the absence of the Muslim Brotherhood, which boycotted the elections—and was perceived as a threat by the Free Officers as the Wafd had campaigned on demands similar to their own</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Aburish30&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accusations of corruption against Wafd politicians began to surface, however, breeding an atmosphere of rumor and suspicion that consequently brought the Free Officers to the forefront of Egyptian politics</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Aburish32&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; By then, the organization had expanded to around ninety members; according to [[Khaled Mohieddin]], &quot;nobody knew all of them and where they belonged in the hierarchy except Nasser&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Aburish32&quot;/&gt; Nasser felt that the Free Officers were not ready to move against the government and, for nearly two years, he did little beyond officer recruitment and underground news bulletins</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Aburish33&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;On 11 October 1951, the Wafd government abrogated the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, which had given the British control over the Suez Canal until 1956</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Aburish33&quot;/&gt; The popularity of this move, as well as that of government-sponsored guerrilla attacks against the British, put pressure on Nasser to act</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Aburish33&quot;/&gt; According to Sadat, Nasser decided to wage &quot;a large scale assassination campaign&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Aburish34&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1952, he and [[Hassan Ibrahim]] attempted to kill the royalist general [[Hussein Sirri Amer]] by firing their submachine guns at his car as he drove through the streets of Cairo</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Aburish34&quot;/&gt; Instead of killing the general, the attackers wounded an innocent female passerby</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Aburish34&quot;/&gt; Nasser recalled that her wails &quot;haunted&quot; him and firmly dissuaded him from undertaking similar actions in the future</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Aburish34&quot;/&gt;Sirri Amer was close to King Farouk, and was nominated for the presidency of the Officer's Club—normally a ceremonial office—with the king's backing</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Aburish34&quot;/&gt; Nasser was determined to establish the independence of the army from the monarchy, and with Amer as the intercessor, resolved to field a nominee for the Free Officers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Aburish34&quot;/&gt; They selected [[Muhammad Naguib]], a popular general who had offered his resignation to Farouk in 1942 over British high-handedness and was wounded three times in the Palestine War</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Aburish34-5&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naguib won overwhelmingly and the Free Officers, through their connection with a leading Egyptian daily, ''al-Misri'', publicized his victory while praising the nationalistic spirit of the army</span>

				<span class='text'>Afterwards, Nasser published a simple six-point program in ''[[Rose al-Yūsuf]]'' to dismantle [[feudalism]] and British influence in Egypt</span>
				<span class='text'>In May, Nasser received word that Farouk knew the names of the Free Officers and intended to arrest them; he immediately entrusted Free Officer Zakaria Mohieddin with the task of planning the government takeover by army units loyal to the association</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Aburish39&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=35–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;The Free Officers' intention was not to install themselves in government, but to re-establish a parliamentary democracy</span>
				<span class='text'>Nasser did not believe that a low-ranking officer like himself (a [[lieutenant colonel]]) would be accepted by the Egyptian people, and so selected General Naguib to be his &quot;boss&quot; and lead the coup in name</span>
				<span class='text'>The revolution they had long sought was launched on 22 July and was declared a success the next day</span>
				<span class='text'>The Free Officers seized control of all government buildings, radio stations, and police stations, as well as army headquarters in Cairo</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Aburish39&quot;/&gt; In a move to stave off foreign intervention two days before the revolution, Nasser had notified the American and British governments of his intentions, and both had agreed not to aid Farouk</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stephens|1972|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;On 18 June 1953, the monarchy was abolished and the Republic of Egypt declared, with Naguib as its [[President of Egypt|first president]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Aburish39&quot;/&gt; According to Aburish, after assuming power, Nasser and the Free Officers expected to become the &quot;guardians of the people's interests&quot; against the monarchy and the [[pasha]] class while leaving the day-to-day tasks of government to civilians</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Aburish41&quot;/&gt; They asked former prime minister Ali Maher to accept reappointment to his previous position, and to form an all-civilian cabinet</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Aburish41&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Free Officers then governed as the [[Egyptian Revolutionary Command Council|Revolutionary Command Council]] (RCC) with Naguib as chairman and Nasser as vice-chairman</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nutting|1972|pp=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relations between the RCC and Maher grew tense, however, as the latter viewed many of Nasser's schemes—agrarian reform, abolition of the monarchy, reorganization of political parties&lt;ref name=&quot;Dekmejian24&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Dekmejian|1971|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;—as too radical, culminating in Maher's resignation on 7 September</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Dekmejian24&quot;/&gt; In Nasser's eyes, this law gave the RCC its own identity and transformed the coup into a revolution</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Aburish45&quot;/&gt;Preceding the reform law, in August 1952, communist-led riots broke out at textile factories in [[Kafr el-Dawwar]], leading to a clash with the army that left nine people dead</span>
				<span class='text'>While most of the RCC insisted on executing the riot's two ringleaders, Nasser opposed this</span>
				<span class='text'>Nonetheless, the sentences were carried out</span>
				<span class='text'>The Muslim Brotherhood supported the RCC, and after Naguib's assumption of power, demanded four ministerial portfolios in the new cabinet</span>
				<span class='text'>Nasser turned down their demands and instead hoped to co-opt the Brotherhood by giving two of its members, who were willing to serve officially as independents, minor ministerial posts</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Aburish 222-223&quot;/&gt; During the summit, Nasser developed cordial relations with King Hussein, and ties were mended with the rulers of Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Morocco</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Aburish201&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=200–201}}&lt;/ref&gt; To achieve this, he initiated several reforms to modernize [[al-Azhar University|al-Azhar]], which serves as the ''de facto'' leading authority in [[Sunni Islam]], and to ensure its prominence over the Muslim Brotherhood and the more conservative [[Wahhabism]] promoted by Saudi Arabia</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Aburish201&quot;/&gt; Nasser had used al-Azhar's most willing ''[[ulema]]'' (scholars) as a counterweight to the Brotherhood's Islamic influence, starting in 1953</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Aburish46-7&quot;/&gt;Nasser instructed al-Azhar to create changes in its syllabus that trickled to the lower levels of Egyptian education, consequently allowing the establishment of coeducational schools and the introduction of [[evolution]] into school [[curriculum]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The reforms also included the merger of [[sharia|religious]] and civil courts</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Aburish201&quot;/&gt; Moreover, Nasser forced al-Azhar to issue a [[fatwā]] admitting [[Shia Muslim]]s, [[Alawite]]s, and [[Druze]] into mainstream Islam; for centuries prior, al-Azhar deemed them to be &quot;heretics&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Aburish201&quot;/&gt;===Rivalry with Amer===Following Syria's secession, Nasser grew concerned with Amer's inability to train and modernize the army, and with the [[state within a state]] Amer had created in the military command and [[Egyptian General Intelligence Directorate|intelligence apparatus]]</span>
