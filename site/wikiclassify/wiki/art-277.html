				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lascelles, 2; for detail on &quot;lower fringes&quot;, see Collins, ix–x</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; She was educated primarily by her father and older brothers as well as through her own reading</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; From her teenage years into her thirties she experimented with various literary forms, including an [[epistolary novel]] which she then abandoned, wrote and extensively revised three major novels and began a fourth</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and her sister [[Cassandra Austen|Cassandra]] (to whom most of the letters were originally addressed) burned &quot;the greater part&quot; of the ones she kept and censored those she did not destroy</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Most of the biographical material produced for fifty years after Austen's death was written by her relatives and reflects the family's biases in favour of &quot;good quiet Aunt Jane&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Cassandra was a member of the prominent [[Baron Leigh|Leigh]] family</span>
				<span class='text'>They married on 26 April 1764 at Walcot Church in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; From 1765 until 1801, that is, for much of Jane's life, George Austen served as the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of the [[Church of England|Anglican]] [[parish]]es at [[Steventon, Hampshire]],&lt;ref&gt;Irene Collins estimates that when George Austen took up his duties as rector in 1764, Steventon comprised no more than about thirty families</span>
				<span class='text'>Collins, 86</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and a nearby village</span>
				<span class='text'>From 1773 until 1796, he supplemented this income by farming and by teaching three or four boys at a time who boarded at his home</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Honan, 14, 17–18; Collins, 54</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Austen's immediate family was large: six brothers&amp;nbsp;— James (1765–1819), George (1766–1838), [[Edward Austen Knight|Edward]] (1768–1852), [[Henry Thomas Austen|Henry Thomas]] (1771–1850), [[Francis Austen|Francis William (Frank)]] (1774–1865), [[Charles Austen|Charles John]] (1779–1852)&amp;nbsp;— and one sister, [[Cassandra Austen|Cassandra Elizabeth]] (Steventon, Hampshire, 9 January 1773 – 1845), who, like Jane, died unmarried</span>
				<span class='text'>assandra was Austen's closest friend and confidante throughout her life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Fergus, &quot;Biography&quot;, 3; Tomalin, 142; Honan, 23, 119</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Of her brothers, Austen felt closest to Henry, who became a banker and, after his bank failed, an Anglican clergyman</span>
				<span class='text'>Henry was also his sister's [[literary agent]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;George was sent to live with a local family at a young age because, as Austen biographer Le Faye describes it, he was &quot;mentally abnormal and subject to fits&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;]]Austen was born on 16 December 1775 at [[Steventon, Hampshire|Steventon]] rectory and publicly baptised on 5 April 1776</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Le Faye, ''Family Record'', 27</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; After a few months at home, her mother placed Austen with Elizabeth Littlewood, a woman living nearby, who [[Wet nurse|nursed]] and raised Austen for a year or eighteen months</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, 7–9; Honan, 21–22; Collins, 86; Le Faye, ''Family Record'', 19</span>
				<span class='text'>Le Faye and Collins add that the Austens followed this custom for all of their children</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In 1783, according to family tradition, Jane and Cassandra were sent to [[Oxford]] to be educated by Mrs</span>
				<span class='text'>Ann Cawley and they moved with her to [[Southampton]] later in the year</span>
				<span class='text'>Both girls caught [[typhus]] and Jane nearly died</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Le Faye, ''Family Record'', 47–49; Collins, 35, 133</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Austen was subsequently educated at home, until leaving for boarding school with her sister Cassandra early in 1785</span>
				<span class='text'>The school curriculum probably included some French, spelling, needlework, dancing and music and, perhaps, drama</span>
				<span class='text'>By December 1786, Jane and Cassandra had returned home because the Austens could not afford to send both of their daughters to school</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, 9–10, 26, 33–38, 42–43; Le Faye, ''Family Record'', 52; Collins, 133–134</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Austen acquired the remainder of her education by reading books, guided by her father and her brothers James and Henry</span>

				<span class='text'>Irene Collins believes that Austen &quot;used some of the same school books as the boys&quot; her father tutored</span>
				<span class='text'>Collins, 42</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Austen apparently had unfettered access both to her father's library and that of a family friend, [[Warren Hastings]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Together these collections amounted to a large and varied library</span>
				<span class='text'> Her father was also tolerant of Austen's sometimes risqué experiments in writing, and provided both sisters with expensive paper and other materials for their writing and drawing</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Honan, 66–68; Collins, 43</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; According to Park Honan, a biographer of Austen, life in the Austen home was lived in &quot;an open, amused, easy intellectual atmosphere&quot; where the ideas of those with whom the Austens might disagree politically or socially were considered and discussed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Honan, 211–212</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; After returning from school in 1786, Austen &quot;never again lived anywhere beyond the bounds of her immediate family environment&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Le Faye, ''Family Record'', 52</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Private theatricals were also a part of Austen's education</span>
				<span class='text'>From when she was seven until she was thirteen, the family and close friends staged a series of plays, including [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan|Richard Sheridan]]'s ''[[The Rivals]]'' (1775) and [[David Garrick]]'s ''[[Bon Ton (play)|Bon Ton]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>While the details are unknown, Austen would certainly have joined in these activities, as a spectator at first and as a participant when she was older</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Le Faye, &quot;Chronology&quot;, 2–3; Tucker, &quot;Amateur Theatricals at Steventon&quot;, ''The Jane Austen Companion'', 1–2; Byrne, 1–39; Gay, ix, 1; Tomalin, 31–32, 40–42, 55–57, 62–63; Honan, 35, 47–52, 423–424, n</span>
				<span class='text'>20</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Most of the plays were comedies, which suggests one way in which Austen's comedic and satirical gifts were cultivated</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Honan, 53–54; Lascelles, 106–107; Litz, 14–17</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In 1788, [[The Rice portrait|her portrait]] may have been commissioned by her great uncle, Francis Austen</span>
				<span class='text'>==Juvenilia===[[File:CassandraAusten-HenryIV</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Portrait of [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Declaredly written by &quot;a partial, prejudiced, &amp; ignorant Historian&quot;, ''[[The History of England (Jane Austen)|The History of England]]'' was illustrated by Austen's sister Cassandra (c</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;1790)</span>
				<span class='text'>]Perhaps as early as 1787, Austen began to write poems, stories, and plays for her own and her family's amusement</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Le Faye, ''Family Record'', 66; Litz, &quot;Chronology of Composition&quot;, ''The Jane Austen Companion'', 48; Honan, 61–62, 70; Lascelles, 4</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Austen later compiled &quot;fair copies&quot; of 29 of these early works into three bound notebooks, now referred to as the ''[[Juvenilia (Austen)|Juvenilia]]'', containing pieces originally written between 1787 and 1793</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Honan, 62–76; Le Faye, ''A Family Record'', 270</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; There is manuscript evidence that Austen continued to work on these pieces as late as the period 1809–1811, and that her niece and nephew, Anna and James Edward Austen, made further additions as late as 1814</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, 14; Doody, &quot;The Short Fiction&quot;, ''The Cambridge Companion to Jane Austen'', 85–86</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Among these works are a satirical novel in letters titled ''[[Love and Freindship]]'' {{sic}}&lt;!--well-known misspelling-do not alter--&gt;, in which she mocked popular [[sentimental novel|novels of sensibility]],&lt;ref&gt;Litz, 21; Tomalin, 47; Honan, 73–74; Southam, &quot;Juvenilia&quot;, ''The Jane Austen Companion'', 248–249</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and ''The History of England'', a manuscript of 34 pages accompanied by 13 watercolour miniatures by her sister Cassandra</span>
				<span class='text'>usten's ''History'' [[parody|parodied]] popular historical writing, particularly [[Oliver Goldsmith]]'s ''History of England'' (1764)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Honan, 75</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Austen wrote, for example: &quot;Henry the 4th ascended the throne of England much to his own satisfaction in the year 1399, after having prevailed on his cousin &amp; predecessor Richard the 2nd, to resign it to him, &amp; to retire for the rest of his Life to Pomfret Castle, where he happened to be murdered</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Austen, ''The History of England'', ''Catharine and Other Writings'', 134</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Austen's ''Juvenilia'' are often, according to scholar Richard Jenkyns, &quot;boisterous&quot; and &quot;anarchic&quot;; he compares them to the work of 18th-century novelist [[Laurence Sterne]] and the 20th-century comedy group [[Monty Python]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jenkyns, 31</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Adulthood===As Austen grew into adulthood, she continued to live at her parents' home, carrying out those activities normal for women of her age and social standing: she practised the [[fortepiano]], assisted her sister and mother with supervising servants, and attended female relatives during childbirth and older relatives on their deathbeds</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gary Kelly, &quot;Education and accomplishments,&quot; ''Jane Austen in Context'', 256–257; Tomalin, 101–103, 120–123, 144</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; She sent short pieces of writing to her newborn nieces Fanny Catherine and Jane Anna Elizabeth</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Le Faye, ''Family Record'', 84</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Austen was particularly proud of her accomplishments as a seamstress</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Honan, 265</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; She also attended church regularly, socialized frequently with friends and neighbours,&lt;ref&gt;For social conventions among the gentry generally, see Collins, 105</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and read novels—often of her own composition—aloud with her family in the evenings</span>
				<span class='text'>Socializing with the neighbours often meant dancing, either impromptu in someone's home after supper or at the balls held regularly at the [[assembly rooms]] in the town hall</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, 101–103, 120–123, 144; Honan, 119</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Her brother Henry later said that &quot;Jane was fond of dancing, and excelled in it&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Tomalin, 102; see also Honan, 84</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In 1793, Austen began and then abandoned a short play, later entitled ''[[Sir Charles Grandison (Austen)|Sir Charles Grandison or the happy Man, a comedy in 6 acts]]'', which she returned to and completed around 1800</span>
				<span class='text'>This was a short parody of various school textbook abridgments of Austen's favourite contemporary novel, ''[[The History of Sir Charles Grandison]]'' (1753), by [[Samuel Richardson]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Southam, &quot;Grandison&quot;, ''The Jane Austen Companion'', 187–189</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Honan speculates that at some point not long after writing ''Love and Freindship'' {{sic}} in 1789, Austen decided to &quot;write for profit, to make stories her central effort&quot;, that is, to become a professional writer</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Honan, 93&quot;&gt;Honan, 93</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Beginning in about 1793, she began to write longer, more sophisticated works</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Honan, 93&quot; /&gt;Between 1793 and 1795, Austen wrote ''[[Lady Susan]]'', a short [[epistolary novel]], usually described as her most ambitious and sophisticated early work</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Honan, 101–102; Tomalin, 82–83&lt;/ref&gt; It is unlike any of Austen's other works</span>
				<span class='text'>Austen biographer [[Claire Tomalin]] describes the heroine of the novella as a sexual predator who uses her intelligence and charm to manipulate, betray, and abuse her victims, whether lovers, friends or family</span>
				<span class='text'>Tomalin writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Told in letters, it is as neatly plotted as a play, and as cynical in tone as any of the most outrageous of the [[Restoration comedy|Restoration dramatists]] who may have provided some of her inspiration&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>It stands alone in Austen's work as a study of an adult woman whose intelligence and force of character are greater than those of anyone she encounters</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, 83–84; see also Sutherland, 15</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;===Early novels===After finishing ''Lady Susan'', Austen attempted her first full-length novel&amp;nbsp;— ''Elinor and Marianne''</span>
				<span class='text'>Her sister Cassandra later remembered that it was read to the family &quot;before 1796&quot; and was told through a series of letters</span>
				<span class='text'>Without surviving original manuscripts, there is no way to know how much of the original draft survived in the novel published in 1811 as ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>While retirement and travel were good for the elder Austens, Jane Austen was shocked to be told she was moving from the only home she had ever known</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Collins, 8–9</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; An indication of Austen's state of mind is her lack of productivity as a writer during the time she lived at Bath</span>
				<span class='text'>She was able to make some revisions to ''Susan'', and she began and then abandoned a new novel, ''[[The Watsons]]'', but there was nothing like the productivity of the years 1795–1799</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, 21</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Tomalin suggests this reflects a deep depression disabling her as a writer, but Honan disagrees, arguing Austen wrote or revised her manuscripts throughout her creative life, except for a few months after her father died</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Le Faye, &quot;Chronology&quot;, 6–8; Fergus, &quot;Biography&quot;, 8; Sutherland, 15, 20–22; Tomalin, 168–175; Honan, 215</span>

				<span class='text'>Their younger brother, Harris Bigg-Wither, had recently finished his education at Oxford and was also at home</span>
				<span class='text'>Bigg-Wither proposed and Austen accepted</span>
				<span class='text'>As described by Caroline Austen, Jane's niece, and Reginald Bigg-Wither, a descendant, Harris was not attractive—he was a large, plain-looking man who spoke little, stuttered when he did speak, was aggressive in conversation, and almost completely tactless</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Austen had known him since both were young and the marriage offered many practical advantages to Austen and her family</span>
				<span class='text'>He was the heir to extensive family estates located in the area where the sisters had grown up</span>
				<span class='text'>With these resources, Austen could provide her parents a comfortable old age, give Cassandra a permanent home and, perhaps, assist her brothers in their careers</span>
				<span class='text'>By the next morning, Austen realised she had made a mistake and withdrew her acceptance</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In 1804, while living in Bath, Austen started but did not complete a new novel, ''The Watsons''</span>
				<span class='text'>The story centres on an invalid clergyman with little money and his four unmarried daughters</span>
				<span class='text'>Sutherland describes the novel as &quot;a study in the harsh economic realities of dependent women's lives&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, 15, 21</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Honan suggests, and Tomalin agrees, that Austen chose to stop work on the novel after her father died on 21 January 1805 and her personal circumstances resembled those of her characters too closely for her comfort</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Le Faye, &quot;Chronology&quot;, 7; Tomalin, 182–184; Honan, 203–205</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Honan, 213–214</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; For the next four years, the family's living arrangements reflected their financial insecurity</span>
				<span class='text'>They lived part of the time in rented quarters in Bath before leaving the city in June 1805 for a family visit to Steventon &amp; Godmersham</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;On 5 April 1809, about three months before the family's move to Chawton, Austen wrote an angry letter to Richard Crosby, offering him a new manuscript of ''Susan'' if that was needed to secure immediate publication of the novel, and otherwise requesting the return of the original so she could find another publisher</span>
				<span class='text'>Crosby replied he had not agreed to publish the book by any particular time, or at all, and that Austen could repurchase the manuscript for the £10 he had paid her and find another publisher</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Austen did not have the resources to repurchase the book</span>

				<span class='text'>Austen's niece Anna described the Austen family's life in Chawton: &quot;It was a very quiet life, according to our ideas, but they were great readers, and besides the housekeeping our aunts occupied themselves in working with the poor and in teaching some girl or boy to read or write</span>

				<span class='text'>]--&gt;Austen had many admiring readers in the 19th century who considered themselves part of a literary elite: they viewed their appreciation of Austen's works as a mark of their cultural taste</span>
				<span class='text'>Philosopher and literary critic [[George Henry Lewes]] expressed this viewpoint in a series of enthusiastic articles published in the 1840s and 1850s</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Southam, &quot;Introduction&quot;, Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>1, 152; Southam, &quot;Introduction&quot;, Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>2, 20–21</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This theme continued later in the century with novelist [[Henry James]], who referred to Austen several times with approval and on one occasion ranked her with Shakespeare, [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]], and [[Henry Fielding]] as among &quot;the fine painters of life&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Southam, &quot;Introduction&quot;, Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>2, 70</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The publication of James Edward Austen-Leigh's ''[[A Memoir of Jane Austen]]'' in 1869 introduced Austen to a wider public as &quot;dear aunt Jane&quot;, the respectable maiden aunt</span>
				<span class='text'>Publication of the ''Memoir'' spurred the reissue of Austen's novels&amp;nbsp;— the first popular editions were released in 1883 and fancy illustrated editions and collectors' sets quickly followed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Southam, &quot;Introduction&quot;, Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>2, 58–62</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Author and critic [[Leslie Stephen]] described the popular mania that started to develop for Austen in the 1880s as &quot;Austenolatry&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Southam, &quot;Introduction&quot;, Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>2, 47</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Around the start of the 20th century, members of the literary elite reacted against the popularization of Austen</span>
				<span class='text'>They referred to themselves as ''[[Janeite]]s'' in order to distinguish themselves from the masses who did not properly understand her works</span>

				<span class='text'>2, 46; Johnson, &quot;Austen cults and cultures&quot;, ''The Cambridge Companion to Jane Austen'', 213</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; For example, Henry James responded negatively to what he described as &quot;a beguiled infatuation&quot; with Austen, a rising tide of public interest that exceeded Austen's &quot;intrinsic merit and interest&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Southam, &quot;Henry James on Jane Austen&quot;, Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>2, 230</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;During the last quarter of the 19th century, the first books of criticism on Austen were published</span>
				<span class='text'>In fact, after the publication of the ''Memoir'', more criticism was published on Austen in two years than had appeared in the previous fifty</span>

				<span class='text'>1, 1</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===20th century and beyond===Several important works paved the way for Austen's novels to become a focus of academic study</span>
				<span class='text'>The first important milestone was a 1911 essay by Oxford Shakespearean scholar [[A</span>
				<span class='text'>C</span>
				<span class='text'>Bradley]], which is &quot;generally regarded as the starting-point for the serious academic approach to Jane Austen&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Brian Southam, quoted in Trott, &quot;Critical Responses, 1830–1970&quot;, 92; Southam, &quot;Introduction&quot;, Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>2, 79</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In it, he established the groupings of Austen's &quot;early&quot; and &quot;late&quot; novels, which are still used by scholars today</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Southam, &quot;Introduction&quot;, Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>2, 79</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The second was R</span>
				<span class='text'>W</span>
				<span class='text'>Chapman's 1923 edition of Austen's collected works</span>
				<span class='text'>Not only was it the first scholarly edition of Austen's works, it was also the first scholarly edition of any English novelist</span>
				<span class='text'>The Chapman text has remained the basis for all subsequent published editions of Austen's works</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; With the publication in 1939 of Mary Lascelles's ''Jane Austen and Her Art'', the academic study of Austen took hold</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Southam, &quot;Introduction&quot;, Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>2, 107–109, 124</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Lascelles's innovative work included an analysis of the books Jane Austen read and the effect of her reading on her work, an extended analysis of Austen's style, and her &quot;narrative art&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>At the time, concern arose over the fact that academics were taking over Austen criticism and it was becoming increasingly esoteric&amp;nbsp;— a debate that has continued to the beginning of the 21st century</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Southam, &quot;Criticism 1870–1940&quot;, 108; Watt, &quot;Introduction&quot;, 10–11; Stovel, &quot;Further Reading&quot;, 233; Southam, &quot;Introduction&quot;, Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>2, 127; Todd, 20</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;[[File:AustenTeapotCookies</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|[[Janeite]] cookies]]In a spurt of revisionist views in the 1940s, scholars approached Austen more sceptically and argued that she was a subversive writer</span>
				<span class='text'>These revisionist views, together with [[F</span>
				<span class='text'>R</span>
				<span class='text'>Leavis]]'s and [[Ian Watt]]'s pronouncement that Austen was one of the great writers of English fiction, did much to cement Austen's reputation amongst academics</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Johnson, &quot;Austen cults and cultures&quot;, 219; Todd, 20</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; They agreed that she &quot;combined &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Henry Fielding]]'s and [[Samuel Richardson]]'s&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; qualities of interiority and irony, realism and satire to form an author superior to both&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Todd, 20</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The period since World War II has seen more scholarship on Austen using a diversity of critical approaches, including [[feminist theory]], and perhaps most controversially, [[postcolonialism|postcolonial theory]]</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the continuing disconnection between the popular appreciation of Austen, particularly by modern [[Janeite]]s, and the academic appreciation of Austen has widened considerably</span>

				<span class='text'>659-661&lt;/ref&gt;Sequels, prequels, and adaptations of almost every sort have been based on the novels of Jane Austen, from [[Softcore pornography|soft-core pornography]] to fantasy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lynch, &quot;Sequels&quot;, ''Jane Austen in Context'', 160</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the middle of the 19th century, Austen family members published conclusions to her incomplete novels, and by 2000 there were over 100 printed adaptations</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lynch, &quot;Sequels&quot;, ''Jane Austen in Context'', 160–162</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The first film adaptation was the [[Pride and Prejudice (1940 film)|1940 MGM production of ''Pride and Prejudice'']] starring [[Laurence Olivier]] and [[Greer Garson]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Brownstein, 13</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; [[BBC]] television dramatisations, which were first produced in the 1970s, attempted to adhere meticulously to Austen's plots, characterisations, and settings</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Troost, &quot;The Nineteenth-Century Novel on Film&quot;, 79</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 a great wave of Austen adaptations began to appear, with [[Ang Lee]]'s [[Sense and Sensibility (film)|film of ''Sense and Sensibility'']], for which screenwriter and star [[Emma Thompson]] won an [[Academy Award]], and the BBC's immensely popular TV mini-series ''[[Pride and Prejudice (1995 TV series)|Pride and Prejudice]]'', starring [[Jennifer Ehle]] and [[Colin Firth]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Troost, &quot;The Nineteenth-Century Novel on Film&quot;, 82–84</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Books and scripts that use the general storyline of Austen's novels but change or otherwise modernise the story also became popular at the end of the 20th century</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, ''[[Clueless (film)|Clueless]]'' (1995), [[Amy Heckerling]]'s updated version of ''Emma'', which takes place in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]], became a cultural phenomenon and spawned its [[Clueless (TV series)|own television series]]</span>

				<span class='text'>The small size of the novel-reading public and the large costs associated with hand production (particularly the cost of handmade paper) meant that most novels were published in editions of 500 copies or less, in order to reduce the risks to the publisher and the novelist</span>
				<span class='text'>Even some of the most successful titles during this period were issued in editions of not more than 750 or 800 copies and later reprinted if demand continued</span>
				<span class='text'>Austen's novels were published in larger editions, ranging from about 750 copies of ''Sense and Sensibility'' to about 2,000 copies of ''Emma''</span>
				<span class='text'>It is not clear whether the decision to print more copies than usual of Jane Austen's novels was driven by the publishers or the author</span>
				<span class='text'>Since all but one of Jane Austen's books were originally published &quot;on commission&quot;, the risks of overproduction were largely hers (or Cassandra's after her death) and publishers may have been more willing to produce larger editions than was normal practice when their own funds were at risk</span>
