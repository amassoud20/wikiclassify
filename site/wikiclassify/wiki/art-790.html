				<span class='text'>They were hired to write the score for the 1925 [[Theatre Guild]] production ''[[The Garrick Gaieties]]'', the success of which brought them acclaim</span>
				<span class='text'>odgers and Hart subsequently wrote the music and lyrics for 26 Broadway musicals during a more-than-20-year partnership that ended only with Hart's early death</span>

				<span class='text'> If you can manage to examine his songs technically, and for the moment elude their spell, you will see that they are all meant to be acted, that they are part of a play</span>

				<span class='text'>odgers and Hart teamed a final time in the fall of 1943 for a revival of ''[[A Connecticut Yankee (musical)|A Connecticut Yankee]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Hart had taken off the night of the opening and was gone for two days</span>

				<span class='text'>By all accounts, Hart, who stood just under five feet tall and wreathed himself in cigar smoke, saw himself as an undesirable freak</span>
				<span class='text'>Homosexual in the era of the closet, he pursued a secretive and tormented erotic life of which only hints appear in his songs</span>
