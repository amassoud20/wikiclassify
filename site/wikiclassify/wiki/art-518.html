				<span class='text'>Officially declared by the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] ''optimus princeps'' (&quot;the best ruler&quot;), Trajan is remembered as a successful soldier-emperor who presided over the greatest military expansion in [[Roman history]], leading the empire to attain its maximum territorial extent by the time of his death</span>
				<span class='text'>He is also known for his philanthropic rule, overseeing extensive public [[Trajan#Building activities|building programs]] and implementing [[Alimenta|social welfare policies]], which earned him his enduring reputation as the second of the [[Five Good Emperors]] who presided over an era of peace and prosperity in the [[Mediterranean world]]</span>

				<span class='text'>30–31&lt;/ref&gt; In September 96, Domitian was succeeded by [[Nerva|Marcus Cocceius Nerva]], an old and childless senator who proved to be unpopular with the army</span>
				<span class='text'>After a brief and tumultuous year in power, culminating in a revolt by members of the [[Praetorian Guard]], Nerva was compelled to adopt the more popular Trajan as his heir and successor</span>
				<span class='text'>He died on 27 January 98 and was succeeded by his adopted son without incident</span>
				<span class='text'>s a civilian administrator, Trajan is best known for his extensive public building program, which reshaped the city of [[Rome]] and left numerous enduring landmarks such as [[Trajan's Forum]], [[Trajan's Market]] and [[Trajan's Column]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Early in his reign, he annexed the [[Nabataean kingdom]], creating the province of [[Arabia Petraea]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His conquest of [[Roman Dacia|Dacia]] enriched the empire greatly, as the new province possessed many valuable gold mines</span>
				<span class='text'>However, its exposed position north of the Danube made it susceptible to attack on three sides, and it was later abandoned by Emperor [[Aurelian]]</span>
				<span class='text'>rajan's war against the [[Parthian Empire]] ended with the sack of the capital [[Ctesiphon]] and the annexation of [[Roman Armenia|Armenia]] and [[Mesopotamia (Roman province)|Mesopotamia]]</span>

				<span class='text'>In late 117, while sailing back to Rome, Trajan fell ill and died of a [[stroke]] in the city of [[Gazipaşa|Selinus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was [[apotheosis|deified]] by the Senate and his ashes were laid to rest under Trajan's Column</span>

				<span class='text'>=Sources==As an emperor, Trajan's reputation has endured&amp;nbsp;– he is one of the few rulers whose reputation has survived nineteen centuries</span>
				<span class='text'>Every new emperor after him was honored by the Senate with the wish ''[[felicior Augusto, melior Traiano]]'' (that he be &quot;luckier than [[Augustus]] and better than Trajan&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>Among [[Middle Ages|medieval]] Christian theologians, Trajan was considered a [[virtuous pagan]], while the 18th-century historian [[Edward Gibbon]] popularized the notion of the [[Five Good Emperors]], of whom Trajan was the second</span>

				<span class='text'>Book&amp;nbsp;68 in [[Cassius Dio]]'s ''Roman History'', which survives mostly as Byzantine abridgments and epitomes, is the best source for the political history of Trajan's rule</span>
				<span class='text'>Besides this, [[Pliny the Younger]]'s ''Panegyricus'' and [[Dio of Prusa]]'s orations are the best surviving contemporary sources</span>
				<span class='text'>Both are adulatory perorations, typical of the late Roman era, that describe an idealized monarch and an equally idealized view of Trajan's rule, and concern themselves more with ideology than with actual fact</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bennett, ''Trajan'', xii/xiii and 63&lt;/ref&gt; The Tenth Volume of Pliny's letters contains his correspondence with Trajan, which deals with various aspects of Imperial Roman government, but this correspondence is neither intimate nor candid: it is an exchange of official mail, in which Pliny's stance borders on the servile</span>

				<span class='text'>Wayne State University Press, 1979, ISBN 0-8143-1594-1 , page 427&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, discussion of Trajan and his rule in modern historiography cannot avoid speculation, as well as recourse to non-literary sources such as archaeology and epigraphy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bennett, ''Trajan'', xiii&lt;/ref&gt;==Early life and rise to power==[[File:Trajan2</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Denarius of Trajan, minted in Rome in 101–102 AD]]Marcus Ulpius Traianus was born on 18&amp;nbsp;September 53&amp;nbsp;AD in the Roman province of [[Hispania Baetica]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Syme, Tacitus, 30–44; PIR Vlpivs 575&lt;/ref&gt; (in what is now [[Andalusia]] in modern Spain), in the city of [[Italica]] (now in the municipal area of Santiponce, in the outskirts of [[Seville]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Although frequently designated the first provincial emperor, and dismissed by later writers like [[Cassius Dio]] &quot;an Iberian, and neither an Italian nor even an Italiot&quot;, Trajan appears to have hailed, at least on his father's side, from the area of Tuder (modern [[Todi]]) in in northern [[Umbria]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Trajan's birthplace of Italica was founded as a Roman military colony in 206 BC, although it is unknown when the Ulpii arrived there</span>
				<span class='text'>It is possible, but cannot be substantiated, that Trajan's ancestors married local women and lost their citizenship at some point, but they certainly recovered their status when the city became a [[municipium]] with [[Latin citizenship]] in the mid-1st century BC</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bennett, ''Trajan'', 1–3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Blumberg, ''Great Leaders, Great Tyrants? Contemporary Views of World Rulers who Made History'', 1995, Greenwood Publishing Group, p</span>
				<span class='text'>15: &quot;Trajan is frequently but misleadingly designated the first provincial emperor, because the Ulpii were from Baetica (southern Spain)</span>
				<span class='text'>The family, resident in Spain for some time, originated in Italian Tuder, not far from the Flavian home of Reate</span>
				<span class='text'>The emperor's father, M</span>
				<span class='text'>Ulpius Traianus, was an early adherent of Vespasian and perhaps the old family friend</span>
				<span class='text'>This Trajan evidently married a Marcia (her name is inferred from that of their daughter Marciana) whose family owned brickyards in the vicinity of Ameria, near both Reate and Tuder</span>
				<span class='text'>She was possibly an older sister of Marcia Furnilla, second wife of Vespasian's son Titus</span>
				<span class='text'>Further, Ulpia, sister of the senior Trajan, was a grandmother of Hadrian</span>
				<span class='text'>In other words, the emperor Trajan was succeeded in 117 by his cousin, member of another Italian family resident in Baetica</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt;Trajan was the son of [[Marcia (mother of Trajan)|Marcia]] and [[Marcus Ulpius Traianus (senior)|Marcus Ulpius Traianus]], a prominent [[Roman Senate|senator]] and general from the ''[[Ulpia (gens)|gens Ulpia]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Marcus Ulpius Traianus the elder served Vespasian in the first Jewish war, commanding the X&amp;nbsp;''Fretensis'' legion</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldsworthy|first=Adrian|title=In the name of Rome: The men who won the Roman Empire|date=2003|publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|location=London|page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trajan himself was just one of many well-known Ulpii in a line that continued long after his own death</span>
				<span class='text'>His elder sister was [[Ulpia Marciana]], and his niece was [[Salonina Matidia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''[[Homeland|patria]]'' of the Ulpii was [[Italica]], in Spanish Baetica,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; where their ancestors had settled late in the 3rd&amp;nbsp;century BC</span>
				<span class='text'>s a young man, he rose through the ranks of the [[Roman army]], serving in some of the most contentious parts of the Empire's frontier</span>
				<span class='text'>In 76–77, Trajan's father was [[Roman governor|Governor]] of [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] (''[[Legatus]] pro praetore Syriae''), where Trajan himself remained as ''[[Tribunus]] legionis''</span>
				<span class='text'>From there, after his father's replacement, he seems to have been transferred to an unspecified Rhine province, and Pliny implies that he engaged in active combat duty during both commissions</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In about 86, Trajan's cousin [[Publius Aelius Hadrianus Afer|P</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;Aelius Afer]] died, leaving his young children [[Hadrian]] and [[Paulina#Sister of Hadrian|Paulina]] orphans</span>
				<span class='text'>Trajan and a colleague of his, [[Publius Acilius Attianus]], became co-guardians of the two children, raising them in their respective households</span>
				<span class='text'>round 91, Trajan was nominated as [[Consul]], and he brought [[Apollodorus of Damascus]] with him to [[Rome]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Around this time he married [[Pompeia Plotina]], a noble woman from the settlement at [[Nîmes]]; the marriage ultimately remained childless</span>
				<span class='text'>It is not clear that Trajan was actively predisposed towards [[Homosexuality in ancient Rome|homosexuality]], as [[bisexual]] activity was common among Roman men of the period, and so his homosexual activities could be interpreted as nothing more than a functional aspect of his class</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, [[Cassius Dio]] makes reference to them, and Trajan's putative lovers included [[Hadrian]] and the pages of the imperial household, the actor Pylades, a dancer called Apolaustus, and possibly Licinius Sura and [[Nerva]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bennett, 58&lt;/ref&gt;As the details of Trajan's military career are obscure, it's only sure that in 89, as legate of [[Legio VII Gemina]] in [[Hispania Tarraconensis]], he supported Domitian against an attempted ''coup''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bennett, 43</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Later, he held some unspecified consular commission as governor on either [[Pannonia]] or [[Germania Superior]] - maybe both</span>
				<span class='text'>Pliny attributes to him, at the time, various (and uspecified) feats of arms</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bennett 45 46&quot;&gt;Bennett, 45/46&lt;/ref&gt;As Domitian's successor, [[Nerva]] was unpopular with the army and had just been forced by his Praetorian Prefect [[Casperius Aelianus]] to execute Domitian's killers,&lt;ref&gt;Richard Alston, ''Aspects of Roman History 31BC-AD117''</span>
				<span class='text'>Abingdon: Routledge, 2014, ISBN 978-0-415-61120-6 , page 261&lt;/ref&gt; he felt the need to do something in order to avoid ousting by gaining the support of the military</span>
				<span class='text'>He accomplished this in the summer of 97 by naming Trajan as his adoptive son and successor, basing himself - allegedly - solely on Trajan's outstanding military merits</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bennett 45 46&quot;/&gt; There are hints, however, in contemporary literary sources that Trajan's adoption was imposed on Nerva</span>
				<span class='text'>Pliny actually admitted as much when he wrote that, although an emperor could not be coerced into doing something, if this were the way in which Trajan was raised to power, then it was worth it</span>
				<span class='text'>If this was what actually occurred, Trajan would be a usurper, and the notion of a natural continuity between Nerva's and Trajan's reigns would be an ''ex post'' fiction developed later by historians such as [[Tacitus]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Retrieved July 20, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;When Nerva died on 27&amp;nbsp;January 98, Trajan succeeded to the role of emperor without any outward incident</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the fact that he chose not to hasten towards Rome, but instead to make a lengthy tour of inspection on the Rhine and Danube frontiers, hints to the possible fact that his power position in Rome was unsure and that he first had to assure himself of the loyalty of the armies at the front</span>
				<span class='text'>It is noteworthy that Trajan ordered Prefect Aelianus to attend him in Germany, where he was apparently executed (&quot;put out of the way&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;Grainger, 111&lt;/ref&gt; with his post being taken by [[Attius Suburanus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bennett, 52&lt;/ref&gt; Trajan's accession, therefore, would qualify more as a successful ''coup'' than an orderly succession</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===The ''Correctores'': Greek/Roman relations===As a senatorial Emperor, Trajan was inclined to choose his local basis of political support among the members of the ruling urban oligarchies</span>
				<span class='text'>In the West, that meant local senatorial families like his own</span>
				<span class='text'>In the East, that meant the Greek notables' families</span>
				<span class='text'>The Greeks, however, had their own memories of independence&amp;nbsp;– as well as their commonly acknowledged cultural superiority&amp;nbsp;– and disdained Roman rule instead of seeing themselves as Roman as did their Western counterparts</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Veyne, ''L'Empire Gréco-Romain'', 195/196&lt;/ref&gt; What the Greek oligarchies wanted from Rome was, above all, to be left in peace and to be allowed to concentrate on their local interests&amp;nbsp;– something the Romans were not inclined to do, as they felt the Greeks were shunning their responsibilities in the management of Imperial affairs</span>
				<span class='text'>n outstanding example of this Greek alienation was the personal role played by Dio of Prusa in his relationship with Trajan</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Temporini &amp; Haase, ''Politische Geschichte'', 669&lt;/ref&gt; One of the compensatory measures proposed by Pliny expressed a thoroughly Roman conservative position: as the cities' financial solvency depended on the councilmen' purses, it was necessary to have more councilmen on the local city councils</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Pliny, the best way to achieve this was to lower the minimum age for holding a seat on the council, making it possible for more sons of the established oligarchical families to join and thus contribute to civic spending; this was seen as preferable to enrolling non-noble wealthy upstarts</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Paul Petit, ''Pax Romana'', Berkeley: University of California Press, 1976, ISBN 0-520-02171-1 , page 76&lt;/ref&gt;Besides, the fact that the scheme was subsidized by means of interest payments on loans made by landowners&amp;nbsp;– and mostly large ones, assumed to be more reliable debtors&lt;ref&gt;Richard Duncan-Jones, ''The Economy of the Roman Empire: Quantitative Studies''</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Potts, 143&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale behind Trajan's campaign, in this case, would be one of breaking down a system of Far Eastern trade through small Semitic (&quot;Arab&quot;) cities under Parthia's control and to put it under Roman control instead</span>

				<span class='text'>Princeton University Press, 1995, ISBN 0-691-00170-7, page 15&lt;/ref&gt;In his Dacian conquests, Trajan had already resorted to Syrian auxiliary units, whose veterans, along with Syrian traders, had an important role in the subsequent colonization of Dacia</span>

				<span class='text'>London: Bloomsbury Publishing, 2008, ISBN 978-1-84725-034-6 , page 25&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– therefore apparently procuring Palmyrene support to his ultimate goal of annexing Charax</span>
				<span class='text'>It has even been ventured that, when earlier in his campaign Trajan annexed Armenia, he was bound to annex the whole of Mesopotamia lest the Parthians interrupt the flux of trade from the Persian Gulf and/or foment trouble at the Roman frontier on the Danube</span>

				<span class='text'>Cambridge University Press, 2005, ISBN 978-0-521-83878-8 , page 5&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– was moral and involved frowning upon the &quot;softness&quot; of luxuries, but no economic policy</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Finley, Ancient Economy, 158&quot;&gt;Finley, Ancient Economy, 158&lt;/ref&gt;The alternative view is to see the campaign as triggered by the lure of territorial annexation and prestige,&lt;ref name=&quot;Finley, Ancient Economy, 158&quot;/&gt; the sole motive ascribed by Cassius Dio</span>

				<span class='text'>Dio, who tells this narrative, offers his father&amp;nbsp;– the then governor of Cilicia Apronianus&amp;nbsp;– as a source, and therefore his narrative is possibly grounded on contemporary rumor, or maybe on common Roman displeasure at an empress meddling in political affairs</span>

				<span class='text'>Stuttgart: Franz Steiner Verlag, 1993, ISBN 3-515-05662-9, page 319&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Christianisation]] of Rome resulted in further embellishment of his legend: it was commonly said in [[medieval]] times that [[Pope Gregory I]], through divine intercession, resurrected Trajan from the dead and baptized him into the Christian faith</span>
				<span class='text'>An account of this features in the [[Golden Legend]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ome theologians such as [[Thomas Aquinas]] discussed Trajan as an example of a virtuous pagan</span>

				<span class='text'>An episode referred to as the [[justice of Trajan]] was reflected in several art works</span>

				<span class='text'>t was only during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] that this legacy began to be contested, when [[Edward Gibbon]] expressed doubts about the militarized character of Trajan's reign in contrast to the &quot;moderate&quot; practices of his immediate successors</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Robert Mankin, &quot;Edward Gibbon: Historian in Space&quot;, ''A Companion to Enlightenment Historiography'', Leiden: Brill, 2013, page 34&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theodor Mommsen|Mommsen]] adopted a divided stance towards Trajan, at some point of his posthumously published lectures even speaking about his &quot;vainglory&quot; (''Scheinglorie'')</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Mommsen, ''A History of Rome Under the Emperors'', page 488&lt;/ref&gt; Mommsen also speaks of Trajan's &quot;insatiable, unlimited lust for conquest&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Munich: 1992, page 389</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;It was exactly this military character of Trajan's reign that attracted his early twentieth century biographer, the Italian [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] historian Roberto Paribeni, who in his 1927 two volume biography ''Optimus Princeps'' described Trajan's reign as the acme of the Roman principate, which he saw as Italy's patrimony</span>
