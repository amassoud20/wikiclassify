				<span class='text'>His theatre column was later carried in the ''New York Daily News''</span>
				<span class='text'>His column, ''Little Old New York'', concentrated on [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] shows and gossip, as Winchell's had and, like Winchell, he also did show business news broadcasts on radio</span>

				<span class='text'>Sullivan soon became a powerful starmaker in the entertainment world himself, becoming one of Winchell's main rivals, setting the [[El Morocco]] nightclub in New York as his unofficial headquarters against Winchell's seat of power at the nearby [[Stork Club]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Sullivan continued writing for ''The News'' throughout his broadcasting career and his popularity long outlived that of Winchell</span>

				<span class='text'>Sincerely, Ed Sullivan</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;) Sullivan had little acting ability; in 1967, twenty years after his show's debut, ''Time'' magazine asked &quot;What exactly is Ed Sullivan's talent?&quot; His mannerisms on camera were so awkward that some viewers believed the host suffered from [[Bell's palsy]]</span>

				<span class='text'>He moves like a sleepwalker; his smile is that of a man sucking a lemon; his speech is frequently lost in a thicket of syntax; his eyes pop from their sockets or sink so deep in their bags that they seem to be peering up at the camera from the bottom of twin wells</span>

				<span class='text'>The bill was often international in scope, with many European performers augmenting the American artists</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;time19671013&quot;/&gt;Sullivan had a healthy sense of humor about himself and permitted—even encouraged—impersonators such as [[John Byner]], [[Frank Gorshin]], [[Rich Little]] and especially [[Will Jordan]] to imitate him on his show</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Johnny Carson]] also did a fair impression, and even [[Joan Rivers]] imitated Sullivan's unique posture</span>
				<span class='text'>The impressionists exaggerated his stiffness, raised shoulders, and nasal tenor phrasing, along with some of his commonly used introductions, such as &quot;And now, right here on our stage</span>

				<span class='text'> Later, when the band was slow to respond to a summons to the rehearsal stage, Sullivan commented, &quot;I guess the Crickets are not too excited to be on The Ed Sullivan Show</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;  Holly, still annoyed by Sullivan's attitude, replied, &quot;I hope they're damn more excited than I am</span>

				<span class='text'> He also saw to it that Holly's guitar amplifier was turned off</span>
