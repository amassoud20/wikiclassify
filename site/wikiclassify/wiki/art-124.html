				<span class='text'>As the core of the second-generation leaders, Deng shared his power with several powerful older politicians commonly known as the [[Eight Elders]]</span>

				<span class='text'>He is generally credited with developing China into one of the fastest-growing [[Economy of China|economies]] in the world for over 35 years and raising the [[Standard of living in China|standard of living]] of hundreds of millions of Chinese citizens</span>

				<span class='text'>At that time, the Soviet Union, through the [[Comintern]], an international organization supporting the communist movements, supported the Communists' alliance with the Nationalists of the Kuomintang (KMT) party founded by [[Sun Yat-sen]]</span>
				<span class='text'>e arrived in [[Xi'an]], the stronghold of Feng Yuxiang, in March 1927</span>
				<span class='text'>He was part of the [[Fengtian clique]]'s attempt to prevent the break of the alliance between the KMT and the Communists</span>
				<span class='text'>This split resulted in part from [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s forcing them to flee areas controlled by the KMT</span>
				<span class='text'>After the breakup of the alliance between communists and nationalists, Feng Yuxiang stood on the side of Chiang Kai-shek, and the Communists who participated in their army, such as Deng Xiaoping, were forced to flee</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1929 Deng led the [[Baise Uprising]] in Guangxi province against the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) government</span>
				<span class='text'>The uprising failed and Deng went to the Central Soviet Area in [[Jiangxi]] province</span>
				<span class='text'>=Political rise==Although Deng got involved in the Marxist revolutionary movement in China, the historian Mobo Gao has argued that &quot;Deng Xiaoping and many like him [in the Chinese Communist Party] were not really Marxists, but basically revolutionary nationalists who wanted to see China standing on equal terms with the great global powers</span>
				<span class='text'>They were primarily nationalists and they participated in the Communist revolution because that was the only viable route they could find to Chinese nationalism</span>

				<span class='text'>p</span>
				<span class='text'>46</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Activism in Shanghai and Wuhan===After leaving the army of Feng Yuxiang in the northwest, Deng ended up in the city of [[Wuhan]], where the Communists at that time had their headquarters</span>
				<span class='text'>At that time, he began using the nickname &quot;Xiaoping&quot; and occupied prominent positions in the party apparatus</span>
				<span class='text'>He participated in the historic emergency session on 7 August 1927 in which, by Soviet instruction, the Party dismissed its founder [[Chen Duxiu]], and [[Qu Qiubai]] became the secretary general</span>
				<span class='text'>In Wuhan, Deng first established contact with Mao Zedong, who was then little valued by militant pro-Soviet leaders of the party</span>
				<span class='text'>etween 1927 and 1929, Deng lived in Shanghai, where he helped organize protests that would be harshly persecuted by the Kuomintang authorities</span>
				<span class='text'>The death of many Communist militants in those years led to a decrease in the number of members of the Communist Party, which enabled Deng to quickly move up the ranks</span>
				<span class='text'>During this stage in Shanghai, Deng married a woman he met in Moscow, Zhang Xiyuan</span>
				<span class='text'>==Military campaign in Guangxi===Beginning in 1929, he participated in the struggle against the Kuomintang in [[Guangxi]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The superiority of the forces of Chiang Kai-shek caused a huge number of casualties in the Communist ranks</span>
				<span class='text'>The confrontational strategy of the party leadership was a failure that killed many militants</span>
				<span class='text'>The response to this defeat catalyzed one of the most confusing episodes in the biography of Deng: in March 1931, he left the Communist Army seventh battalion to appear some time later in Shanghai</span>
				<span class='text'>is official biography states that Deng had been charged by his superiors with deserting from the battle zone before fleeing to Shanghai, where there were leaders of the underground Communist Party</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he was not punished in Shanghai, this episode in his biography remains unclear and would be used against him to question his devotion to the Communist Party during the [[Cultural Revolution]] era</span>
				<span class='text'>==At the Jiangxi Soviet==={{unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}After returning to Shanghai, Deng discovered that his wife and daughter had died during childbirth</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, he discovered that many of his former comrades had died as a result of the Kuomintang's crackdown against the Communists</span>
				<span class='text'>he campaigns against the Communists in the cities represented a setback for the party and in particular to the Comintern Soviet advisers, who saw the mobilization of the urban proletariat as the force for the advancement of communism</span>
				<span class='text'>Contrary to the urban vision of the revolution, based on the Soviet experience, the Communist leader Mao Zedong saw the rural peasants as the revolutionary force in China</span>
				<span class='text'>In a mountainous area of Jiangxi province, where Mao went to establish a communist system, there developed the embryo of a future state of China under communism which adopted the official name of the Chinese Soviet Republic, but was better known as the &quot;[[Jiangxi Soviet]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>n one of the most important cities in the Soviet zone, [[Ruijin]], Deng took over as secretary of the Party Committee in the summer of 1931</span>
				<span class='text'>In the winter of 1932, Deng went on to play the same position in the nearby district of [[Huichang County|Huichang]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1933 he became director of the propaganda department of the Provincial Party Committee in Jiangxi</span>
				<span class='text'>It was then that he married a young woman he had met in Shanghai named Jin Weiying</span>
				<span class='text'>he successes of the Soviet in Jiangxi made the party leaders decide to move to Jiangxi from Shanghai</span>
				<span class='text'>The confrontation among Mao, the party leaders, and their Soviet advisers was increasingly tense and the struggle for power between the two factions led to the removal of Deng, who favored the ideas of Mao, from his position in the propaganda department</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite the strife within the party, the Jiangxi Soviet became the first successful experiment of communist rule in rural China</span>
				<span class='text'>It even issued stamps and paper money under the letterhead of the Soviet Republic of China, and the army of Chiang Kai-shek finally decided to attack the communist area</span>
				<span class='text'>==The Long March==={{main|Long March}}[[File:1937 Deng Xiaoping in NRA uniform</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|Deng Xiaoping in NRA uniform, 1937]]Surrounded by the more powerful army of the Republic of China, the Communists fled Jiangxi in October 1934</span>

				<span class='text'>' Reforms and Openness)</span>
				<span class='text'>China's domestic social, political, and most notably, economic systems would undergo significant changes during Deng's time as leader</span>
				<span class='text'>The goals of Deng's reforms were summed up by the [[Four Modernizations]], those of agriculture, industry, science and technology, and the military</span>
				<span class='text'>he strategy for achieving these aims of becoming a modern, industrial nation was the [[socialist market economy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Deng argued that China was in the [[primary stage of socialism]] and that the duty of the party was to perfect so-called &quot;[[socialism with Chinese characteristics]]&quot;, and &quot;[[seek truth from facts]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>(This somewhat resembles the Leninist theoretical justification of the [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP) in the 1920s, which argued that the [[Soviet Union]] had not gone deeply enough into the capitalist phase and therefore needed limited capitalism in order to fully evolve its means of production</span>
				<span class='text'>This interpretation of Maoism reduced the role of ideology in economic decision-making</span>
				<span class='text'>Downgrading communitarian values, but not necessarily the criticising the ideology of [[Marxism-Leninism]], Deng emphasized that &quot;socialism does not mean shared poverty&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>His theoretical justification for allowing market forces was given as such:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Planning and market forces are not the essential difference between socialism and capitalism</span>
				<span class='text'>A planned economy is not the definition of socialism, because there is planning under capitalism; the market economy happens under socialism, too</span>
				<span class='text'>Planning and market forces are both ways of controlling economic activity</span>

				<span class='text'>ISBN 0-19-280612-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Unlike [[Hua Guofeng]], Deng believed that no policy should be rejected outright simply because it was not associated with Mao</span>
				<span class='text'>Unlike more conservative leaders such as [[Chen Yun]], Deng did not object to policies on the grounds that they were similar to ones which were found in capitalist nations</span>
				<span class='text'>his political flexibility towards the foundations of socialism is strongly supported by quotes such as:{{quote|We mustn't fear to adopt the advanced management methods applied in capitalist countries (</span>
				<span class='text'></span>

				<span class='text'>ISBN 972-20-2696-8&lt;/ref&gt;}}Although Deng provided the theoretical background and the political support to allow economic reform to occur, it is in general consensus amongst historians that few of the economic reforms that Deng introduced were originated by Deng himself</span>
				<span class='text'>Premier [[Zhou Enlai]], for example, pioneered the Four Modernizations years before Deng</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, many reforms would be introduced by local leaders, often not sanctioned by central government directives</span>
				<span class='text'>If successful and promising, these reforms would be adopted by larger and larger areas and ultimately introduced nationally</span>
				<span class='text'>An often cited example is the [[household-responsibility system]], which was first secretly implemented by a poor rural village at the risk of being convicted as &quot;counter-revolutionary</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; This experiment proved very successful</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Dali Yang, Calamity and Reform in China, Stanford University Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Deng openly supported it and it was later adopted nationally</span>

				<span class='text'>The bottom-up approach of the Deng reforms, in contrast to the top-down approach of ''perestroika'', was likely a key factor in the success of the former</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cited by Susan L</span>

				<span class='text'>ISBN 0-520-07706-7&lt;/ref&gt;Deng's reforms actually included the introduction of planned, centralized management of the macro-economy by technically proficient bureaucrats, abandoning Mao's mass campaign style of economic construction</span>
				<span class='text'>However, unlike the Soviet model, management was indirect through market mechanisms</span>
				<span class='text'>Deng sustained Mao's legacy to the extent that he stressed the primacy of agricultural output and encouraged a significant decentralization of decision making in the rural economy teams and individual peasant households</span>
				<span class='text'>At the local level, material incentives, rather than political appeals, were to be used to motivate the labor force, including allowing peasants to earn extra income by selling the produce of their private plots at free market</span>
				<span class='text'>=== Export focus ====In the move toward market allocation,  local municipalities and provinces were allowed to invest in industries that they considered most profitable, which encouraged investment in light manufacturing</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, Deng's reforms shifted China's development strategy to an emphasis on light industry and [[export-oriented industrialization|export-led growth]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Light industrial output was vital for a developing country coming from a low capital base</span>
				<span class='text'>With the short gestation period, low capital requirements, and high foreign-exchange export earnings, revenues generated by light manufacturing were able to be reinvested in technologically more advanced production and further capital expenditures and investments</span>
				<span class='text'>owever, in sharp contrast to the similar, but much less successful reforms in the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] and the [[People's Republic of Hungary]], these investments were not government mandated</span>
				<span class='text'>The capital invested in heavy industry largely came from the banking system, and most of that capital came from consumer deposits</span>
				<span class='text'>One of the first items of the Deng reforms was to prevent reallocation of profits except through taxation or through the banking system; hence, the reallocation in state-owned industries was somewhat indirect, thus making them more or less independent from government interference</span>
				<span class='text'>In short, Deng's reforms sparked an industrial revolution in China</span>

				<span class='text'>tml &quot;Looking back over China's last 30 years&quot;] ''CNN''&lt;/ref&gt;These reforms were a reversal of the Maoist policy of economic self-reliance</span>
				<span class='text'>China decided to accelerate the modernization process by stepping up the volume of foreign trade, especially the purchase of machinery from Japan and the West</span>
				<span class='text'>By participating in such export-led growth, China was able to step up the Four Modernizations by attaining certain foreign funds, market, advanced technologies and management experiences, thus accelerating its economic development</span>
				<span class='text'>Deng attracted foreign companies to a series of [[Special Economic Zones of the People's Republic of China|Special Economic Zones]], where foreign investment and market liberalization were encouraged</span>
				<span class='text'>he reforms sought to improve labor productivity</span>
				<span class='text'>New material incentives and bonus systems were introduced</span>
				<span class='text'>Rural markets selling peasants' homegrown products and the surplus products of communes were revived</span>
				<span class='text'>Not only did rural markets increase agricultural output, they stimulated industrial development as well</span>
				<span class='text'>With peasants able to sell surplus agricultural yields on the open market, domestic consumption stimulated industrialization as well and also created political support for more difficult economic reforms</span>
				<span class='text'>here are some parallels between Deng's [[market socialism]] especially in the early stages, and [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s NEP as well as those of [[Nikolai Bukharin]]'s economic policies, in that both foresaw a role for private entrepreneurs and markets based on trade and pricing rather than central planning</span>
				<span class='text'>An interesting anecdote on this note is the first meeting between Deng and [[Armand Hammer]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Deng pressed the industrialist and former investor in Lenin's Soviet Union for as much information on the NEP as possible</span>
				<span class='text'>==Role in the Tiananmen Square protests==={{Main|Tiananmen Square protests of 1989}}The Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, culminating in the June Fourth Massacre, were a series of demonstrations in and near Tiananmen Square in the People's Republic of China (PRC) between 15 April and 4 June 1989, a year in which many other [[Revolutions of 1989|socialist governments collapsed]]</span>
				<span class='text'>he protests were sparked by the death of [[Hu Yaobang]], a reformist official backed by Deng but ousted by the [[Eight Elders]] and the conservative wing of the politburo</span>
				<span class='text'>Many people were dissatisfied with the party's slow response and relatively subdued funeral arrangements</span>
				<span class='text'>Public mourning began on the streets of Beijing and universities in the surrounding areas</span>
				<span class='text'>In Beijing this was centered on the [[Monument to the People's Heroes]] in Tiananmen Square</span>
				<span class='text'>The mourning became a public conduit for anger against perceived nepotism in the government, the unfair dismissal and early death of Hu, and the behind-the-scenes role of the &quot;old men&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>By the eve of Hu's funeral, the demonstration had reached 100,000 people on Tiananmen Square</span>

				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|Statue of Deng in [[Shenzhen]]]]When compared to the memorials of other former CPC leaders, those dedicated to Deng have been relatively low profile, in keeping with Deng's pragmatism</span>
				<span class='text'> Likewise, he was cremated after death, as opposed to being embalmed like Mao</span>
				<span class='text'>here are a few public displays of Deng in the country</span>
				<span class='text'>A bronze statue of Deng was erected on 14 November 2000, at the grand plaza of Lianhua Mountain Park ({{zh|s=莲花山公园|t=蓮花山公園|p=Liánhuāshān Gōngyuán}}) of [[Shenzhen]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This statue is dedicated to Deng's role as a great planner and contributor to the development of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, starting in 1979</span>
				<span class='text'>The statue is {{Convert|6|m|ft|0}} high, with an additional 3</span>
				<span class='text'>8-meter base</span>
				<span class='text'>The statue shows Deng striding forward confidently</span>
				<span class='text'>Many CPC high level leaders visit the statue frequently</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, in many coastal areas and on the island province of [[Hainan]], Deng is seen on large roadside billboards with messages emphasizing economic reform or his policy of [[One country, two systems]]</span>

				<span class='text'>The statue was erected to commemorate Deng's 100th birthday</span>
