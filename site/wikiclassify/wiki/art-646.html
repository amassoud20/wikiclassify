				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Evans|2001|pp=151–168}}As media scrutiny on Patton increased, his bluntness stirred a number of controversies, including when he was quoted in 1945 comparing Nazis to Democrats and Republicans,{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=165–166}}{{sfn|Blumenson|Hymel|2008|p=87}} and again later that year when he attempted to honor several wounded veterans in a speech by calling them &quot;the real heroes&quot; of the war, unintentionally offending the families of soldiers who had been killed in action</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=163–164}} His largest controversy came prior to Operation Overlord when he implied to reporters that the British and Americans, and not the Soviet Union, would dominate the post-war world, stirring tension among the already delicate alliance</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=586}} Eisenhower stated that his lack of tact was a flaw which limited his leadership potential, in spite of his many accomplishments</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|Patton's well-known custom ivory-handled revolver]]As a leader, Patton was known to be highly critical, correcting subordinates mercilessly for the slightest infractions, but also being quick to praise their accomplishments</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=77–79}} While he garnered a reputation as a general who was both impatient and impulsive and had little tolerance for officers who had failed to succeed, he fired only one general during World War II, [[Orlando Ward]], and only after two warnings, whereas Bradley sacked numerous generals during the war</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|D'Este|1995|pp=467–468}} Patton reportedly had the utmost respect for the men serving in his command, particularly the wounded, although he tended to classify cases of psychological battlefield breakdown, today identified as [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], as &quot;malingering</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Atkinson|2007|p=147}} Many of his directives showed special trouble to care for the enlisted men under his command, and he was well known for arranging extra supplies for battlefield soldiers, including blankets and extra socks, galoshes, and other items normally in short supply at the front</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Wallace|1946|p=97}}Patton remained outspoken and unabashed in his feelings of [[racism]] throughout his life</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=4}} His attitudes  were likely cultivated from his privileged upbringing and family roots in the [[Confederate States of America|southern United States]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Brighton|2009|p=18}} Privately he wrote of black soldiers: &quot;Individually they were good soldiers, but I expressed my belief at the time, and have never found the necessity of changing it, that a colored soldier cannot think fast enough to fight in armor</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Patton|1947|p=60}} However, he also stated that performance was more important than race or religious affiliation: &quot;I don't give a damn who the man is</span>
				<span class='text'>He can be a nigger or a Jew, but if he has the stuff and does his duty, he can have anything I've got</span>
				<span class='text'>By God! I love him</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Hirshson|2003|p=864}} In spite of these views, Patton called heavily on the black troops under his command</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=4}}After reading the [[Qur'an|Koran]] and observing North Africans, he wrote to his wife, &quot;Just finished reading the Koran&amp;nbsp;– a good book and interesting</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Patton had a keen eye for native customs and methods and wrote knowingly of local architecture; he once rated the progress of word-of-mouth rumor in [[Arab]] country at {{convert|40|–|60|mi}} a day</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|D'Este|2002|p=801}} Eisenhower revealed his reasoning in a 1946 review of the book ''Patton and his Third Army'': &quot;George Patton was the most brilliant commander of an army in the open field that our or any other service produced</span>
				<span class='text'>But his army was part of a whole organization and his operations part of a great campaign</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=818}} Eisenhower believed that other generals such as Bradley should be given the credit for planning the successful Allied campaigns across Europe in which Patton was merely &quot;a brilliant executor&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=818}}Notwithstanding Eisenhower's estimation of Patton's abilities as a strategic planner, his overall view of Patton's military value in achieving Allied victory in Europe can best be seen in Eisenhower's refusal to even consider sending Patton home after the slapping incidents of 1943, after which he privately remarked, &quot;Patton is indispensable to the war effort&amp;nbsp;– one of the guarantors of our victory</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=536}} As [[Assistant Secretary of War]] [[John J</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|D'Este|2002|p=442}} After Patton's death, Eisenhower would write his own tribute: &quot;He was one of those men born to be a soldier, an ideal combat leader&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>It is no exaggeration to say that Patton's name struck terror at the hearts of the enemy</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=818}}[[Carlo D'Este]] insisted that Bradley disliked Patton both personally and professionally,{{sfn|D'Este|1995|pp=466–467}}{{sfn|D'Este|2002|pp=403–404}} but Bradley biographer Jim DeFelice noted that the evidence indicates otherwise</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|DeFelice|2011|p=402}} President [[Franklin D</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=755}}For the most part, British commanders did not hold Patton in high regard</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] [[Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke|Alan Brooke]] noted in January 1943 that &quot;I had heard of him, but I must confess that his swashbuckling personality exceeded my expectation</span>
				<span class='text'>I did not form any high opinion of him, nor had I any reason to alter this view at any later date</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=451}} One possible exception was Field Marshal [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the latter's rivalry with Patton was well known, Montgomery appears to have admired Patton's ability to command troops in the field, if not his strategic judgment</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=549}} Other Allied commanders were more impressed, the [[Free French]] in particular</span>
				<span class='text'>General [[Henri Giraud]] was incredulous when he heard of Patton's dismissal by Eisenhower in late 1945, and invited him to Paris to be decorated by [[Provisional Government of the French Republic|President]] [[Charles de Gaulle]] at a state banquet</span>
				<span class='text'>At the banquet, President de Gaulle gave a speech placing Patton's achievements alongside those of Napoleon</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=801}} Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] was apparently an admirer, stating that the [[Red Army]] could neither have planned nor executed Patton's rapid armored advance across France</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|McNeese|2003|p=78}}|group=Note}} and many of its highest commanders also held his abilities in high regard</span>
