				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot;/&gt; ''48 Hrs</span>

				<span class='text'>Nolte was scheduled to host the December 11, 1982, Christmas episode of ''Saturday Night Live'', but became too ill to host, so Murphy took over</span>
				<span class='text'>He became the only cast member to host while still a regular</span>
				<span class='text'>Murphy opened the show with the phrase, &quot;Live from New York, It's the Eddie Murphy Show!&quot; The following year, Murphy starred in ''[[Trading Places]]'' with fellow ''SNL'' alumnus [[Dan Aykroyd]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot;/&gt; The movie marked the first of Murphy's collaborations with director [[John Landis]] (who also directed Murphy in ''[[Coming to America]]'' and ''[[Beverly Hills Cop III]]'') and proved to be an even greater box office success than ''48 Hrs</span>

				<span class='text'>Murphy, who was credited as a &quot;Strategic Guest Star&quot;, was added to the film after an original version was completed but tested poorly with audiences</span>
				<span class='text'>''Best Defense'' was a major financial and critical disappointment</span>
				<span class='text'>When he hosted ''SNL'', Murphy joined the chorus of those bashing ''Best Defense'', calling it &quot;the worst movie in the history of everything&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Murphy's ''[[Trading Places]]'' co-star [[Dan Aykroyd]] had originally written the character of [[Winston Zeddemore]] in ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' specifically for Murphy, but he was unable to commit at the time due to the ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]'' shooting schedule</span>
				<span class='text'>The part ultimately went to [[Ernie Hudson]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Murphy was also offered a part in 1986's ''[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]]'', a role that, after being heavily re-written from comic relief to love interest, ultimately went to future ''[[7th Heaven (TV series)|7th Heaven]]'' star [[Catherine Hicks]]</span>
				<span class='text'>By this point&lt;ref&gt;according to the autobiography of the film's director and co-star, [[Leonard Nimoy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Murphy's near-exclusive contract with [[Paramount Pictures]] rivaled ''Star Trek'' as Paramount's most lucrative franchise</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1986, Murphy starred in the [[supernatural]] comedy, ''[[The Golden Child]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot;/&gt; Although ''The Golden Child'' performed well at the box office, the movie was not as critically acclaimed as ''[[48 Hrs</span>
				<span class='text'>]'', ''[[Trading Places]]'', and ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>''The Golden Child'' was considered a change of pace for Murphy because of the [[supernatural]] setting as opposed to the more &quot;street smart&quot; settings of Murphy's previous efforts</span>

				<span class='text'>]'' and Murphy's comedy special ''[[Eddie Murphy Delirious]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>As a solo artist, Murphy had two hit singles, &quot;[[Party All the Time]]&quot; (which was produced by [[Rick James]]) and &quot;Put Your Mouth on Me&quot; during the latter half of the 1980s (although he actually started singing earlier in his career, with the songs &quot;Boogie in Your Butt&quot; and &quot;Enough Is Enough&quot;, the latter being a parody of [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Donna Summer]]'s 1979 song, &quot;[[No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)|No More Tears]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>They both appear on his 1982 self-titled comedy album</span>
				<span class='text'> &quot;Party All the Time&quot; was featured on Murphy's 1985 debut album ''[[How Could It Be]]'', which included a minor follow-up [[R&amp;B]] hit in the title track, a duet with vocalist Crystal Blake</span>
				<span class='text'>This track was written by Rusty Hamilton and was produced by [[Stevie Wonder]]'s cousin Aquil Fudge after a brief falling out with Rick James</span>
				<span class='text'>In 2004, [[VH-1]] and ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' voted &quot;Party All the Time&quot; number seven among the &quot;50 Worst Songs of All-Time</span>

				<span class='text'>hough uncredited, Murphy provided vocal work on ''SNL'' castmate [[Joe Piscopo]]'s comedy single, &quot;The Honeymooners Rap</span>

				<span class='text'>n ''[[Coming to America]]'', he imitated [[Jackie Wilson]] when he sang &quot;To Be Loved&quot;, but because the character he was playing had a thick accent, he had to sing it in character</span>
				<span class='text'>In later years, Murphy performed several songs in the ''[[Shrek (film series)|Shrek]]'' film franchise</span>
				<span class='text'>In the first film, he performed a version of &quot;[[I'm a Believer]]&quot; in the film's final scene; in ''[[Shrek 2]]'' he performed [[Ricky Martin]]'s hit &quot;[[Livin' La Vida Loca]]&quot; along with co-star [[Antonio Banderas]]</span>

				<span class='text'>]'' ''[[Harlem Nights]]'' featured Murphy, who had previously been known only as a performer, as director, producer, star, and co-writer, with his brother, [[Charlie Murphy]], as well as supporting roles for Murphy's comic idols [[Redd Foxx]] and [[Richard Pryor]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot;/&gt;During this period Murphy was criticized by filmmaker [[Spike Lee]] for not using his show business stature to help black actors break into film, despite Murphy's films (especially those he produced) often being populated with predominantly black casts (''[[Coming To America]], [[Harlem Nights]], [[Boomerang (1992 film)|Boomerang]], [[Vampire in Brooklyn]], [[Life (1999 film)|Life]]'')</span>
				<span class='text'>Many black actors who would later gain wider recognition make early appearances in Murphy films such as [[Damon Wayans]] in ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]'', [[Halle Berry]] and [[Martin Lawrence]] in ''[[Boomerang (1992 film)|Boomerang]]'', [[Samuel L</span>
				<span class='text'>Jackson]] and [[Cuba Gooding Jr</span>
				<span class='text'>] in ''[[Coming to America]],'' [[Dave Chappelle]] in ''[[The Nutty Professor (1996 film)|The Nutty Professor]]'' and [[Chris Rock]] in ''[[Beverly Hills Cop II]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough Murphy has enjoyed commercial success since ''Saturday Night Live'', he did not participate in the making of the ''Live From New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live'' retrospective book by [[Tom Shales]] and James Andrew Miller (2002), nor did he ever attend cast reunions or anniversary specials until his appearance on the [[Saturday Night Live (season 40)#Specials|''SNL'' 40th anniversary special]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Murphy's box office results began to recover in 1996, starting with ''[[The Nutty Professor (1996 film)|The Nutty Professor]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>==1998 to present===He followed with a series of very successful family-friendly movies like ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'', ''[[Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Dolittle (film)|Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Dolittle]]'' and [[Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Dolittle 2|its sequel]], the ''[[Shrek (franchise)|Shrek]]'' series, ''[[Daddy Day Care]]'', and ''[[The Haunted Mansion (film)|The Haunted Mansion]]'', along with ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>However, most of his movies meant for more adult audiences performed moderately; ''[[Metro (1997 film)|Metro]]'', ''[[I Spy (film)|I Spy]]'', and ''[[Showtime (film)|Showtime]]'' all grossed less than $40&amp;nbsp;million domestically, ''[[Holy Man]]'' performed poorly, grossing less than $13&amp;nbsp;million, and ''[[The Adventures of Pluto Nash]]'' is on record as one of the biggest theatrical money-losers of all time, grossing just $7&amp;nbsp;million worldwide on a reported $110&amp;nbsp;million budget</span>
				<span class='text'>A notable exception to this run of poorly received adult-themed films was the [[Frank Oz]] comedy ''[[Bowfinger]]'', also starring [[Steve Martin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The film garnered generally positive critical reviews, and grossed $98&amp;nbsp;million at the box office</span>
