				<span class='text'>n 1856, his chance meeting with [[Eugene Boudin]], a painter of small beach scenes, opened his eyes to the possibility of plein-air painting</span>
				<span class='text'>From that time, with a short interruption for military service, he dedicated himself to searching for new and improved methods of painterly expression</span>
				<span class='text'>To this end, as a young man, he visited the Paris Salon and familiarised himself with the works of older painters, and made friends with other young artists</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=GJ/&gt; The five years that he spent at [[Argenteuil]], spending much time on the River Seine in a little floating studio, were formative in his study of the effects of light and reflections</span>
				<span class='text'>He began to think in terms of colours and shapes rather than scenes and objects</span>
				<span class='text'>He used bright colours in dabs and dashes and squiggles of paint</span>
				<span class='text'>Having rejected the academic teachings of Gleyre's studio, he freed himself from theory, saying &quot;I like to paint as a bird sings</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jennings, p</span>
				<span class='text'>130&lt;/ref&gt;In 1877 a series of paintings at St-Lazare Station had Monet looking at smoke and steam and the way that they affected colour and visibility, being sometimes opaque and sometimes translucent</span>
				<span class='text'>He was to further use this study in the painting of the effects of mist and rain on the landscape</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jennings, p</span>
				<span class='text'>132&lt;/ref&gt; The study of the effects of atmosphere were to evolve into a number of series of paintings in which Monet repeatedly painted the same subject in different lights, at different hours of the day, and through the changes of weather and season</span>
