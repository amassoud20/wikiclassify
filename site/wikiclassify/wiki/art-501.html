				<span class='text'>ng|right|thumb|200px|The Doors logo, designed by an [[Elektra Records]] assistant, first appeared on their 1967 debut album</span>
				<span class='text'>]The origins of the Doors began with a meeting between acquaintances [[Jim Morrison]] and [[Ray Manzarek]], both of whom had attended the [[UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television]], on [[Venice Beach]] in July 1965</span>
				<span class='text'>Morrison told Manzarek he had been writing songs (Morrison said &quot;I was taking notes at a fantastic rock'n'roll concert going on in my head&quot;) and with Manzarek's encouragement sang &quot;[[Moonlight Drive]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The members came from a varied musical background from jazz, rock, blues, and folk idioms</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;The Doors, The Grove Dictionary of American Music, 2nd edition, 10 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;Keyboardist Manzarek was in a band called [[Rick &amp; the Ravens]] with his brothers Rick and Jim, while drummer John Densmore was playing with the Psychedelic Rangers and knew Manzarek from meditation classes</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=pc43&gt;{{Pop Chronicles|43}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August, Densmore joined the group, which had been renamed the Doors, and the five (Morrison having previously joined the band), along with bass player Patty Sullivan (later credited using her married name Patricia Hansen in the 1997 box CD release) recorded a six-song demo in September 1965</span>
				<span class='text'>This has circulated widely since then as a [[bootleg recording]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The band took their name from the title of [[Aldous Huxley]]'s book ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'', itself derived from a line in [[William Blake]]'s ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'': &quot;If the doors of perception were cleansed, everything would appear to man as it is: infinite&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;According to the documentary on the Doors, ''[[When You're Strange]]''&lt;/ref&gt;In mid-1965, after Manzarek's two brothers left, the group recruited guitarist Robby Krieger and the best-known lineup — Morrison, Manzarek, Krieger and Densmore — was complete</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Whisky a Go-Go</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|left|thumb|200px|[[Whisky a Go Go]]]]By 1966, the group was playing the Los Angeles club [[London Fog (nightclub)|London Fog]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The club was not as prestigious as the [[Whisky a Go Go]] and did not attract many customers</span>
				<span class='text'>The Doors used the nearly empty club as an opportunity to hone and, in some cases, lengthen their songs and work &quot;The End&quot;, &quot;When the Music's Over&quot; and &quot;Light My Fire&quot; into musical epics</span>

				<span class='text'>He did score one at Columbia Records but it did not pan out</span>
				<span class='text'>Prior to that, The Doors first recording was a demo they did for Richard Bock's [[Pacific Jazz Records]] subsidiary label, Aura Records, recorded on September 2, 1965</span>
				<span class='text'>n August 10, they were spotted by [[Elektra Records]] president [[Jac Holzman]], who was present at the recommendation of [[Love (band)|Love]] singer [[Arthur Lee (musician)|Arthur Lee]], whose group was with Elektra Records</span>

				<span class='text'>The Doors were fired from the Whisky on August 21, 1966 when Morrison added an explicit retelling and profanity-laden version of the Greek myth of Oedipus during &quot;[[The End (The Doors song)|The End]]&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>The Doors' [[The Doors (album)|self-titled]] debut [[album|LP]] was released in the first week of January 1967</span>
				<span class='text'>It featured most of the major songs from their set, including the nearly 12-minute musical drama &quot;[[The End (The Doors song)|The End]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>n November 1966, [[Mark Abramson]] directed a promotional film for the lead single &quot;[[Break On Through (To the Other Side)]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>To promote the single, the Doors made their television debut on a Los Angeles TV show called ''Boss City'' circa 1966, possibly early 1967, and then on a Los Angeles TV show called ''Shebang'', miming to &quot;Break On Through&quot;, on New Year's Day 1967</span>
				<span class='text'>This clip has never been officially released by the Doors</span>
				<span class='text'>n early 1967 the Doors appeared on ''The Clay Cole Show'' (which aired on Saturday evenings at 6 pm on WPIX Channel 11 out of NYC) where they performed their single &quot;Break On Through&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Research has determined that the tapes were all wiped</span>
				<span class='text'>The only shows that still exist are the final ones copied by an employee of the station, although this was long after the Doors' appearance</span>
				<span class='text'>The Doors returned to ''The Clay Cole Show'' a second time on June 24 where they most likely performed &quot;Light My Fire&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=February 2012}}Since &quot;Break on Through&quot; was not very successful on the radio, the band turned to &quot;[[Light My Fire]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'> The problem with this song was that it was seven minutes long, so producer Paul Rothchild cut it down to three minutes by radically cutting the lengthy keyboard and guitar solos in the center section</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;Light My Fire&quot; became the first single from Elektra Records to reach number one on the ''[[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]'' singles chart, selling over one million copies</span>

				<span class='text'> The epitaph on his headstone bears the Greek inscription &quot;ΚΑΤΑ ΤΟΝ ΔΑΙΜΟΝΑ ΕΑΥΤΟΥ&quot;, literally meaning &quot;According to his own daimōn&quot; and usually interpreted as &quot;True to his own spirit&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'> Krieger released six solo albums from 1977 to 2010</span>
				<span class='text'>All of the ex-Doors solo albums have met with mixed reviews</span>

				<span class='text'> The EP was later included on a double CD, ''[[In Concert (The Doors album)|In Concert]]'', which also compiled the ''Alive She Cried'' album as well as ''Absolutely Live'' for the first time on CD</span>
				<span class='text'> ''In Concert'' has since been replaced with a single disc remastered edition of ''Absolutely Live''</span>

				<span class='text'>Some of the material had been previously available on bootlegs</span>
				<span class='text'>A notable inclusion on the compilation was a CD of highlights from the 1970 Felt Forum concert and a cleaned-up recording of the (edited) 1969 &quot;Rock Is Dead&quot; session</span>

				<span class='text'>The 2006 box set contained about two hours of mostly unheard studio outtakes from the first six albums</span>
				<span class='text'>Each album was represented by two discs: a CD of the album and the bonus tracks, and a [[DVD-Audio]] with both stereo and 5</span>
				<span class='text'> surround sound mixes (produced and mixed by [[Bruce Botnick]]) in 96&amp;nbsp;kHz/24-bit [[Linear pulse code modulation|LPCM]], [[Dolby Digital]], and [[DTS (sound system)|DTS]], as well as mostly previously released video footage</span>
				<span class='text'>The discs were accompanied by new liner notes by Botnick and articles from several music critics and historians for each album</span>

				<span class='text'>This was launched with a sampler of forthcoming material, mostly from live concerts</span>
				<span class='text'>The first full release was a two-CD set of the May 1970 show at [[Detroit]]'s [[Cobo Center]], notable for being, according to Doors manager [[Danny Sugerman]] in its liner notes, &quot;easily</span>

				<span class='text'>The infamous Miami show has become widely available while many 1970 shows, notably a radio broadcast of the June 5 [[Seattle]] and June 6 Vancouver show, make the rounds</span>
				<span class='text'>The complete 1969 ''Rock Is Dead'' studio jam was discovered in the mid-1990s</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''Rock is Dead'' and in interviews Morrison makes it clear that the music is a continued exploration of the Dionysian mythic content that had informed his earlier poetry</span>
