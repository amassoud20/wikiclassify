				<span class='text'>1100 â€“ c</span>
				<span class='text'>1155) was a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] cleric and one of the major figures in the [[English historians in the Middle Ages|development of British historiography]] and the popularity of tales of [[King Arthur]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He is best known for his chronicle ''{{lang|la|[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]}}'' (&quot;History of the Kings of Britain&quot;), which was widely popular in its day and was credited, uncritically, well into the 16th century,&lt;ref&gt;[[Polydore Vergil]]'s sceptical reading of Geoffrey of Monmouth provoked at first a reaction of denial in England, &quot;yet the seeds of doubt once sown&quot; eventually replaced Geoffrey's romances with a new Renaissance historical approach, according to Hans Baron, &quot;Fifteenth-century civilisation and the Renaissance&quot;, in ''The New Cambridge Modern history'', vol</span>

				<span class='text'>He must have reached the [[age of majority]] by 1129, when he is recorded as witnessing a charter</span>
				<span class='text'>n his ''Historia'', Geoffrey refers to himself as ''Galfridus Monemutensis'', &quot;Geoffrey of Monmouth&quot;, which indicates a significant connection to [[Monmouth]], Wales, and which may refer to his birthplace</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Roberts98 /&gt; Geoffrey's works attest to some acquaintance with the place-names of the region</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Roberts98 /&gt; To contemporaries, Geoffrey was known as ''Galfridus Artur(us)'' or variants thereof</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;DNB&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Roberts98 /&gt; The &quot;Arthur&quot; in these versions of his name may indicate the name of his father, or a nickname based on Geoffrey's scholarly interests</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;DNB&quot; /&gt;Earlier scholars assumed that Geoffrey was Welsh or at least spoke Welsh</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;DNB&quot; /&gt; Geoffrey's knowledge of the Welsh language appears to have been slight however,&lt;ref name=&quot;DNB&quot; /&gt; and it is now recognised that there is no real evidence that Geoffrey was of either Welsh or [[Cambro-Norman]] descent, unlike for instance, [[Gerald of Wales]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He may have sprung from the same French-speaking elite of the Welsh border country as the writers Gerald of Wales and [[Walter Map]], and [[Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester|Robert, Earl of Gloucester]], to whom Geoffrey dedicated versions of his ''Historia Regum Britanniae''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;DNB&quot; /&gt; It has been argued, by [[Frank Merry Stenton|Frank Stenton]] among others, that Geoffrey's parents may have been among the many Bretons who took part in [[William the Conqueror|William I]]'s Conquest and settled in the southeast of Wales</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Roberts98 /&gt; Monmouth had been in the hands of [[Breton people|Breton]] lords since 1075&lt;ref name=Roberts98 /&gt; or 1086&lt;ref name=&quot;DNB&quot; /&gt; and the names Galfridus and Arthur (if interpreted as a patronymic) were more common among the Bretons than the Welsh</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Roberts98 /&gt;He may have served for a while in a [[Benedictine]] priory in Monmouth,&lt;ref name=&quot;dunn&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Dunn, Charles W</span>

				<span class='text'>| year = 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; but most of his adult life appears to have been spent outside Wales</span>
				<span class='text'>Between 1129 and 1151 his name appears on six charters in the [[Oxford]] area, sometimes styled ''magister'' (&quot;teacher&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;DNB&quot;/&gt; He was probably a secular [[canon (priest)|canon]] of St</span>
				<span class='text'>George's college</span>
				<span class='text'>All the charters signed by Geoffrey are also signed by [[Walter of Oxford|Walter, Archdeacon of Oxford]], also a canon at that church</span>
				<span class='text'>Another frequent co-signatory is Ralph of Monmouth, a canon of [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;DNB&quot;/&gt;On 21 February 1152, at [[Lambeth]] [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Archbishop]] [[Theobald of Bec|Theobald]] consecrated Geoffrey as [[Bishop of St Asaph]], having ordained him a priest at Westminster 10 days before</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;There is no evidence that he ever visited his see,&quot; writes [[Lewis Thorpe]], &quot;and indeed the wars of [[Owain Gwynedd]] make this most unlikely</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;From the introduction to his translation of ''The History of the Kings of Britain'' (London: Penguin Books, 1966), p</span>
				<span class='text'>12</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He appears to have died between 25 December 1154 and 24 December 1155, in 1155 according to Welsh chronicles, when his apparent successor, Richard, took office</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;DNB&quot; /&gt;==''{{lang|la|Historia Regum Britanniae}}''==Geoffrey wrote several works of interest, all in Latin, the language of learning and literature in Europe during the medieval period</span>
				<span class='text'>His major work was the ''{{lang|la|[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]}}'' (''History of the Kings of Britain''), the work best known to modern readers</span>
				<span class='text'>It relates the purported history of [[Great Britain|Britain]], from its first settlement by [[Brutus of Troy|Brutus]], a descendant of the [[Troy|Trojan]] hero [[Aeneas]], to the death of [[Cadwaladr|Cadwallader]] in the 7th century, taking in [[Julius Caesar]]'s invasions of Britain, two kings, [[Leir of Britain|Leir]] and [[Cunobelinus|Cymbeline]], [[King Lear|later immortalised]] by [[William Shakespeare]], and one of the earliest developed narratives of [[King Arthur]]</span>
				<span class='text'>eoffrey claims in his dedication that the book is a translation of an &quot;ancient book in the British language that told in orderly fashion the deeds of all the kings of Britain&quot;, given to him by Walter, Archdeacon of Oxford</span>
				<span class='text'>Modern historians have dismissed this claim</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Richard M</span>
				<span class='text'>Loomis, ''The Romance of Arthur'' New York &amp; London, Garland Publishing, Inc</span>
				<span class='text'>1994, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>59&lt;/ref&gt; It is, however, likely that the Archdeacon furnished Geoffrey with some materials in the Welsh language that helped inspire his work, as Geoffrey's position and acquaintance with the Archdeacon would not have afforded him the luxury of fabricating such a claim outright</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Michael Curley, ''Geoffrey of Monmouth'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>12&lt;/ref&gt; Much of it is based on the ''[[Historia Britonum]]'', a 9th-century Welsh-Latin historical compilation, [[Bede]]'s ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'' and [[Gildas]]'s 6th-century polemic ''[[De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae]]'' expanded with material from [[Bardic]] oral tradition, genealogical tracts, and embellished by Geoffrey's own imagination</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Thorpe, ''Kings of Britain'' pp</span>
				<span class='text'>14â€“19</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In an exchange of manuscript material for their own histories, [[Robert of Torigny]] gave [[Henry of Huntingdon]] a copy of ''Historia regum Britanniae'', which both Robert and Henry used uncritically as authentic history and subsequently used in their own works,&lt;ref&gt;[[C</span>
				<span class='text'>Warren Hollister]], ''Henry I'' (Yale English Monarchs), 2001:11 note44</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; by which means some of Geoffrey's fictions became embedded in popular history</span>
				<span class='text'>'{{lang|la|Historia Regum Britanniae}}'' is now acknowledged as a literary work of [[national myth]] containing little reliable history</span>
				<span class='text'>This has since led many modern scholars to agree with [[William of Newburgh]], who wrote around 1190 that &quot;it is quite clear that everything this man wrote about Arthur and his successors, or indeed about his predecessors from [[Vortigern]] onwards, was made up, partly by himself and partly by others&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Thorpe, ''Kings of Britain'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>17</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Other contemporaries were similarly unconvinced by Geoffrey's &quot;History&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, [[Giraldus Cambrensis]] recounts the experience of a man possessed by demons: &quot;If the evil spirits oppressed him too much, the Gospel of St John was placed on his bosom, when, like birds, they immediately vanished; but when the book was removed, and the History of the Britons by 'Geoffrey Arthur' (as Geoffrey named himself) was substituted in its place, they instantly reappeared in greater numbers, and remained a longer time than usual on his body and on the book</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gerald of Wales, ''[[Itinerarium Cambriae|The Journey through Wales]]/[[Descriptio Cambriae|The Description of Wales]]'' (Lewis Thorpe ed</span>
				<span class='text'>, Penguin, 1978, Chapter 5, p 116</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Geoffrey's major work was nevertheless widely disseminated across the whole of Medieval Western Europe: Acton Griscom listed 186 extant manuscripts in 1929, and others have been identified since</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Thorpe, ''Kings of Britain'' p</span>
				<span class='text'>28&lt;/ref&gt; It enjoyed a significant afterlife in a variety of forms, including translations/adaptations such as the Anglo-Norman ''[[Roman de Brut]]'' of [[Wace]], the Middle English ''[[Brut (Layamon)|Brut]]'' of [[Layamon]], and several anonymous Middle Welsh versions known as ''{{lang|cy|[[Brut y Brenhinedd]]}}'' (&quot;''Brut'' of the kings&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Thorpe, ''Kings of Britain'' p</span>
				<span class='text'>29&lt;/ref&gt; where it was generally accepted as a true account</span>
				<span class='text'>=Other writings=={{details|Prophetiae Merlini}}The earliest of Geoffrey's writings to appear was probably the ''{{lang|la|Prophetiae Merlini}}'' (''Prophecies of Merlin''), which he wrote at some point before 1135, and which appears both independently and incorporated into the ''{{lang|la|Historia Regum Britanniae}}''</span>
				<span class='text'>It consists of a series of obscure prophetic utterances attributed to [[Merlin]], which Geoffrey claimed to have translated from an unspecified language</span>
				<span class='text'>eoffrey's structuring and reshaping of the Merlin and Arthur myths engendered the vast popularity of Merlin and Arthur myths in later literature, a popularity that lasts to this day; he is generally viewed by scholars as the major establisher of the Arthurian canon</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Thorpe, ''Kings of Britain'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>20ff</span>
				<span class='text'> particularly pp</span>
				<span class='text'>20â€“22 &amp; 28â€“31</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The ''Historia'''s effect on the legend of King Arthur was so vast that Arthurian works have been categorised as &quot;pre-&quot; or &quot;post-Galfridian&quot; depending on whether or not they were influenced by him</span>
				<span class='text'>he third work attributed to Geoffrey is another [[hexameter]] poem ''{{lang|la|[[Vita Merlini]]}}'' (&quot;Life of Merlin&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''{{lang|la|Vita}}'' is based much more closely on traditional material about Merlin than are the other works; here he is known as Merlin of the Woods (''{{lang|la|Merlinus Sylvestris}}'') or Scottish Merlin (''Merlinus Caledonius''), and is portrayed as an old man living as a crazed and grief-stricken outcast in the forest</span>
				<span class='text'>The story is set long after the timeframe of ''{{lang|la|Historia}}'''s Merlin, but the author tries to synchronise the works with references to the mad prophet's previous dealings with [[Vortigern]] and Arthur</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''{{lang|la|Vita}}'' did not circulate widely, and the attribution to Geoffrey appears in only one late 13th-century manuscript, but it contains recognisably Galfridian elements in its construction and content, and most critics are content to recognise it as his</span>
