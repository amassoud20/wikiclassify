				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;nick22&quot;/&gt; For the project, Carey worked with [[Walter Afanasieff]], who only had a small role on her debut, as well as [[Robert ClivillÃ©s]] and [[David Cole (record producer)|David Cole]], from the [[dance music|dance]] group [[C+C Music Factory]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;nick23&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Carey's relationship with Margulies deteriorated over a personal contract Carey had signed with him before signing the record deal with Columbia, agreeing to split not only the songwriting royalties from the songs, but half of her earnings as well</span>
				<span class='text'>However, when the time came to write music for ''Emotions,'' Sony officials made it clear he would only be paid the fair amount given to co-writers on an album</span>
				<span class='text'>Margulies later filed a lawsuit against Sony which ultimately led to their parting of ways</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;nick22&quot;/&gt; ''Emotions'' was released on September 17, 1991, and was accepted by critics as a more mature album than its predecessor</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=nycc/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;shapiro2&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Shapiro|2001|pp=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; In hopes of putting to rest any claims of her being a manufactured artist, Carey and [[Walter Afanasieff]] decided to book an appearance on [[MTV Unplugged]], a television program aired by [[MTV]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Browne had commented &quot;But beginning two decades ago, melisma overtook pop in a way it hadn't before</span>
				<span class='text'>Mariah Carey's debut hit from 1990, &quot;Vision of Love,&quot; followed two years later by Whitney Houston's version of &quot;I Will Always Love You,&quot; set the bar insanely high for notes stretched louder, longer and knottier than most pop fans had ever heard</span>

				<span class='text'>And young white pop starsâ€”including [[Britney Spears]], [[Jessica Simpson]], [[Christina Aguilera]], and [[NSYNC|'N Sync]]â€”have spent much of the past ten years making pop music that is unmistakably R&amp;B</span>
