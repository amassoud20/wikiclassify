				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|[[Luigi Galvani]], Volta's rival</span>
				<span class='text'>][[Luigi Galvani]], an Italian physicist, discovered something he named &quot;animal electricity&quot; when two different metals were connected in series with a frog's leg and to one another</span>
				<span class='text'>Volta realised that the frog's leg served as both a conductor of electricity (what we would now call an [[electrolyte]]) and as a detector of electricity</span>
				<span class='text'>He replaced the frog's leg with brine-soaked paper, and detected the flow of electricity by other means familiar to him from his previous studies</span>
				<span class='text'>n this way he discovered the [[electrochemical series]], and the law that the [[electromotive force]] (emf) of a [[galvanic cell]], consisting of a pair of metal [[electrode]]s separated by electrolyte, is the difference between their two electrode potentials (thus, two identical electrodes and a common electrolyte give zero net emf)</span>
				<span class='text'>This may be called Volta's Law of the electrochemical series</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1800, as the result of a professional disagreement over the galvanic response advocated by Galvani, Volta invented the [[voltaic pile]], an early [[Battery (electricity)|electric battery]], which produced a steady electric current</span>

				<span class='text'>063}}&lt;/ref&gt;The battery made by Volta is credited as the first electrochemical cell</span>
				<span class='text'>It consists of two electrodes: one made of [[zinc]], the other of [[copper]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[electrolyte]] is either [[sulfuric acid]] mixed with water or a form of saltwater [[brine]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The electrolyte exists in the form 2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'>The zinc, which is higher in the [[standard electrode potential (data page)|electrochemical series]] than both copper and hydrogen, reacts with the negatively charged sulfate (SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;)</span>
				<span class='text'>The positively charged hydrogen ions ([[proton]]s) capture [[electron]]s from the copper, forming bubbles of hydrogen gas, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'>This makes the zinc rod the negative electrode and the copper rod the positive electrode</span>
				<span class='text'>hus, there are two terminals, and an [[electric current]] will flow if they are connected</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[chemical reaction]]s in this voltaic cell are as follows::Zinc:::Zn &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;:Sulfuric acid:::2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;The copper does not react, but rather it functions as an electrode for the electric current</span>
				<span class='text'>owever, this cell also has some disadvantages</span>
				<span class='text'>It is unsafe to handle, since sulfuric acid, even if diluted, can be hazardous</span>
				<span class='text'>Also, the power of the cell diminishes over time because the hydrogen gas is not released</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, it accumulates on the surface of the zinc electrode and forms a barrier between the metal and the electrolyte solution</span>

				<span class='text'>I have, indeed, and only too often, failed in the performance of those good works which are the mark of a Catholic Christian, and I have been guilty of many sins: but through the special mercy of God I have never, as far as I know, wavered in my faith</span>

				<span class='text'>I studied attentively the grounds and basis of religion, the works of apologists and assailants, the reasons for and against, and I can say that the result of such study is to clothe religion with such a degree of probability, even for the merely natural reason, that every spirit unperverted by sin and passion, every naturally noble spirit must love and accept it</span>
