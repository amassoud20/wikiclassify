				<span class='text'>name ArchiveBook Volta and Galvani an Italian physicist discovered something he named animal electricity when two different metals were connected in series with a frogs leg and to one another</span>
				<span class='text'>Volta realised that the frogs leg served as both a conductor of electricity what we would now call an  and as a detector of electricity</span>
				<span class='text'>He replaced the frogs leg with brine soaked paper and detected the flow of electricity by other means familiar to him from his previous studies</span>
				<span class='text'>n this way he discovered the  and the law that the  emf of a  consisting of a pair of metal s separated by electrolyte is the difference between their two electrode potentials thus two identical electrodes and a common electrolyte give zero net emf</span>
				<span class='text'>This may be called Voltas Law of the electrochemical series</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1800 as the result of a professional disagreement over the galvanic response advocated by Galvani Volta invented the  an early  which produced a steady electric current</span>
				<span class='text'>name Routledge  Volta had determined that the most effective pair of dissimilar metals to produce electricity was  and </span>
				<span class='text'>Initially he experimented with individual cells in series each cell being a wine goblet filled with  into which the two dissimilar electrodes were dipped</span>
				<span class='text'>The voltaic pile replaced the goblets with cardboard soaked in brine</span>

				<span class='text'>The battery made by Volta is credited as the first electrochemical cell</span>
				<span class='text'>It consists of two electrodes one made of  the other of </span>
				<span class='text'>The  is either  mixed with water or a form of saltwater </span>
				<span class='text'>The electrolyte exists in the form 2Hsup+ sup and SOsub4 subsup2− sup</span>
				<span class='text'>The zinc which is higher in the  than both copper and hydrogen reacts with the negatively charged sulfate SOsub4 subsup2− sup</span>
				<span class='text'>The positively charged hydrogen ions s capture s from the copper forming bubbles of hydrogen gas Hsub2 sub</span>
				<span class='text'>This makes the zinc rod the negative electrode and the copper rod the positive electrode</span>
				<span class='text'>hus there are two terminals and an  will flow if they are connected</span>
				<span class='text'>The s in this voltaic cell are as followsZincZn bigbig→ big big Znsup2+ sup + 2esup− supSulfuric acid2Hsup+ sup + 2esup− sup bigbig→ big big Hsub2 subThe copper does not react but rather it functions as an electrode for the electric current</span>
				<span class='text'>owever this cell also has some disadvantages</span>
				<span class='text'>It is unsafe to handle since sulfuric acid even if diluted can be hazardous</span>
				<span class='text'>Also the power of the cell diminishes over time because the hydrogen gas is not released</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead it accumulates on the surface of the zinc electrode and forms a barrier between the metal and the electrolyte solution</span>

				<span class='text'>55   Nevertheless he cast out doubts in a declaration of faith in which he saidblockquoteI do not understand how anyone can doubt the sincerity and constancy of my attachment to the religion which I profess the Roman Catholic and Apostolic religion in which I was born and brought up and of which I have always made confession externally and internally</span>
				<span class='text'>I have indeed and only too often failed in the performance of those good works which are the mark of a Catholic Christian and I have been guilty of many sins but through the special mercy of God I have never as far as I know wavered in my faith</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>In this faith I recognise a pure gift of God a supernatural grace but I have not neglected those human means which confirm belief and overthrow the doubts which at times arise</span>
				<span class='text'>I studied attentively the grounds and basis of religion the works of apologists and assailants the reasons for and against and I can say that the result of such study is to clothe religion with such a degree of probability even for the merely natural reason that every spirit unperverted by sin and passion every naturally noble spirit must love and accept it</span>
				<span class='text'>May this confession which has been asked from me and which I willingly give written and subscribed by my own hand with authority to show it to whomsoever you will for I am not ashamed of the Gospel may it produce some good fruitKneller Karl Alois https  archive</span>
