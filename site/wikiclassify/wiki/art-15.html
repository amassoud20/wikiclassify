				<span class='text'>Corso, recently released from prison, was supported by the Pony Stable patrons and was writing poetry there the night of their meeting</span>
				<span class='text'>Ginsberg claims he was immediately attracted to Corso, who was straight, but understanding of homosexuality after three years in prison</span>
				<span class='text'>Ginsberg was even more struck by reading Corso's poems, realizing Corso was &quot;spiritually gifted</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Ginsberg introduced Corso to the rest of his inner circle</span>
				<span class='text'>In their first meeting at the Pony Stable, Corso showed Ginsberg a poem about a woman who lived across the street from him and sunbathed naked in the window</span>
				<span class='text'>Amazingly, the woman happened to be Ginsberg's girlfriend that he was living with during one of his forays into heterosexuality</span>
				<span class='text'>Ginsberg took Corso over to their apartment</span>
				<span class='text'>There the woman proposed sex with Corso, who was still very young and fled in fear</span>
				<span class='text'>Ginsberg introduced Corso to Kerouac and Burroughs and they began to travel together</span>
				<span class='text'>Ginsberg and Corso remained lifelong friends and collaborators</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Miles&quot;/&gt;Shortly after this period in Ginsberg's life, he became romantically involved with [[Elise Cowen|Elise Nada Cowen]] after meeting her through Alex Greer, a philosophy professor at [[Barnard College]] whom she had dated for a while during the burgeoning Beat generation's period of development</span>
				<span class='text'>As a Barnard student, Elise Cowen extensively read the poetry of [[Ezra Pound]] and [[T</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Eliot]], when she met [[Joyce Johnson]] and Leo Skir, among other Beat players</span>
				<span class='text'> As Cowen had felt a strong attraction to darker poetry most of the time, Beat poetry seemed to provide an allure to what suggests a shadowy side of her persona</span>
				<span class='text'> While at Barnard, Cowen earned the nickname &quot;Beat Alice&quot; as she had joined a small group of anti-establishment artists and visionaries known to outsiders as beatniks, and one of her first acquaintances at the college was the beat poet Joyce Johnson who later portrayed Cowen in her books, including &quot;Minor Characters&quot; and ''Come and Join the Dance'', which expressed the two women's experiences in the Barnard and Columbia Beat community</span>
				<span class='text'>Through his association with Elise Cowen, Ginsberg discovered that they shared a mutual friend, Carl Solomon, to whom he later dedicated his most famous poem &quot;Howl&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>This poem is considered an autobiography of Ginsberg up to 1955, and a brief history of the Beat Generation through its references to his relationship to other Beat artists of that time</span>
				<span class='text'>==The Blake vision===In 1948 in an apartment in [[Harlem]], Ginsberg had an auditory hallucination while reading the poetry of [[William Blake]] (later referred to as his &quot;Blake vision&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>At first, Ginsberg claimed to have heard the voice of God, but later interpreted the voice as that of Blake himself reading ''[[Ah, Sunflower]]'', ''[[The Sick Rose]]'', and ''Little Girl Lost'', also described by Ginsberg as &quot;voice of the ancient of days&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The experience lasted several days</span>
				<span class='text'>Ginsberg believed that he had witnessed the interconnectedness of the universe</span>
				<span class='text'>He looked at lattice-work on the [[fire escape]] and realized some hand had crafted that; he then looked at the sky and intuited that some hand had crafted that also, or rather, that the sky was the hand that crafted itself</span>
				<span class='text'>He explained that this hallucination was not inspired by drug use, but said he sought to recapture that feeling later with various drugs</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Miles&quot;/&gt; Ginsberg stated: &quot;living blue hand itself [E]xistence itself was God&quot; and &quot;[I] felt a sudden awakening into a totally deeper real universe</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;===San Francisco Renaissance===Ginsberg moved to San Francisco during the 1950s</span>
				<span class='text'>Before, ''Howl and Other Poems'' was published in 1956 by City Lights Bookshop, he worked as a market researcher</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Schumacher, Michael 2002&quot;&gt;Schumacher, Michael (January 27, 2002)</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Allen Ginsberg Project&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In 1954, in San Francisco, Ginsberg met [[Peter Orlovsky]] (1933–2010), with whom he fell in love and who remained his lifelong partner</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Miles&quot;/&gt; Selections from their correspondence have been published</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Straight Hearts' Delight: Love Poems and Selected Letters'', by Allen Ginsberg and Peter Orlovsky, edited by Winston Leyland</span>
				<span class='text'>Gay Sunshine Press, 1980, ISBN 0917342658&lt;/ref&gt;Also in San Francisco, Ginsberg met members of the [[San Francisco Renaissance]] (James Broughton, Robert Duncan, Madeline Gleason and Kenneth Rexroth) and other poets who would later be associated with the Beat Generation in a broader sense</span>
				<span class='text'>Ginsberg's mentor [[William Carlos Williams]] wrote an introductory letter to San Francisco Renaissance figurehead [[Kenneth Rexroth]], who then introduced Ginsberg into the San Francisco poetry scene</span>
				<span class='text'>There, Ginsberg also met three budding poets and [[Zen]] enthusiasts who had become friends at [[Reed College]]: [[Gary Snyder]], [[Philip Whalen]], and [[Lew Welch]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1959, along with poets John Kelly, [[Bob Kaufman]], [[A</span>
				<span class='text'>D</span>
				<span class='text'>Winans]], and William Margolis, Ginsberg was one of the founders of the ''Beatitude'' poetry magazine</span>
				<span class='text'>[Wally Hedrick]] — a painter and co-founder of the Six Gallery – approached Ginsberg in mid-1955 and asked him to organize a poetry reading at the Six Gallery</span>
				<span class='text'>At first, Ginsberg refused, but once he had written a rough draft of &quot;Howl&quot;, he changed his &quot;fucking mind&quot;, as he put it</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Raskin&quot; /&gt; Ginsberg advertised the event as &quot;Six Poets at the Six Gallery&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>One of the most important events in Beat mythos, known simply as &quot;The [[Six Gallery reading]]&quot; took place on October 7, 1955</span>

				<span class='text'>Of more personal significance to Ginsberg, the reading that night included the first public presentation of &quot;Howl&quot;, a poem that brought worldwide fame to Ginsberg and to many of the poets associated with him</span>
				<span class='text'>An account of that night can be found in [[Kerouac]]'s novel ''[[The Dharma Bums]]'', describing how change was collected from audience members to buy jugs of wine, and Ginsberg reading passionately, drunken, with arms outstretched</span>
				<span class='text'>insberg's principal work, &quot;Howl&quot;, is well known for its opening line: &quot;I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>&quot; &quot;Howl&quot; was considered scandalous at the time of its publication, because of the rawness of its language</span>
				<span class='text'>Shortly after its 1956 publication by San Francisco's [[City Lights Bookstore]], it was banned for obscenity</span>
				<span class='text'>The ban became a [[wikt:cause célèbre|cause célèbre]] among defenders of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], and was later lifted, after Judge Clayton W</span>
				<span class='text'>Horn declared the poem to possess redeeming artistic value</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Miles&quot;/&gt; Ginsberg and [[Shig Murao]], the City Lights manager who was jailed for selling &quot;Howl,&quot; became lifelong friends</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ball, Gordon, &quot;'Howl' and Other Victories: A friend remembers City Lights' Shig Murao,&quot; ''San Francisco Chronicle,'' 11/28/99</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;====Biographical references in &quot;Howl&quot;====Ginsberg claimed at one point that all of his work was an extended biography (like Kerouac's ''Duluoz Legend'')</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Howl&quot; is not only a biography of Ginsberg's experiences before 1955, but also a history of the Beat Generation</span>
				<span class='text'>Ginsberg also later claimed that at the core of &quot;Howl&quot; were his unresolved emotions about his schizophrenic mother</span>
				<span class='text'>Though &quot;Kaddish&quot; deals more explicitly with his mother, &quot;Howl&quot; in many ways is driven by the same emotions</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Howl&quot; chronicles the development of many important friendships throughout Ginsberg’s life</span>
				<span class='text'> He begins the poem with “I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness”, which sets the stage for Ginsberg to describe Cassady and Solomon, immortalizing them into American literature</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Raskin /&gt; This madness was the “angry fix” that society needed to function—madness was its disease</span>
				<span class='text'>In the poem, Ginsberg focused on “Carl Solomon! I’m with you in Rockland”, and, thus, turned Solomon into an archetypal figure searching for freedom from his “straightjacket”</span>
				<span class='text'>Though references in most of his poetry reveal much about his biography, his relationship to other members of the Beat Generation, and his own political views, &quot;Howl&quot;, his most famous poem, is still perhaps the best place to start</span>
				<span class='text'>==To Paris and the &quot;Beat Hotel&quot;, Tangier and India</span>
				<span class='text'>===In 1957, Ginsberg surprised the literary world by abandoning San Francisco</span>
				<span class='text'>After a spell in [[Morocco]], he and Peter Orlovsky joined Gregory Corso in Paris</span>
				<span class='text'>Corso introduced them to a shabby lodging house above a bar at 9 rue Gît-le-Coeur that was to become known as the [[Beat Hotel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>They were soon joined by Burroughs and others</span>
				<span class='text'>It was a productive, creative time for all of them</span>
				<span class='text'>There, Ginsberg began his epic poem &quot;Kaddish&quot;, Corso composed ''Bomb'' and ''Marriage'', and Burroughs (with help from Ginsberg and Corso) put together ''[[Naked Lunch]],'' from previous writings</span>
				<span class='text'>This period was documented by the photographer [[Harold Chapman]], who moved in at about the same time, and took pictures constantly of the residents of the &quot;hotel&quot; until it closed in 1963</span>
				<span class='text'>During 1962–3, Ginsberg and Orlovsky travelled extensively across [[India]], living half a year at a time in [[Calcutta]] (Kolkata) and Benares (Varanasi)</span>
				<span class='text'>Also during this time, he formed friendships with some of the prominent young [[Bengali people|Bengali]] poets of the time including [[Shakti Chattopadhyay]] and [[Sunil Gangopadhyay]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Ginsberg had several political connections in India most notably [[Pupul Jayakar]] who helped him extend his stay in India when the authorities were eager to expel him</span>
				<span class='text'>==England and the International Poetry Incarnation===In May 1965, Allen Ginsberg arrived in London, and offered to read anywhere for free</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ref-1&quot;/&gt; [[Thomas McGrath (poet)|Tom McGrath]] wrote &quot;''This could well turn out to have been a very significant moment in the history of England – or at least in the history of English Poetry''&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>[[Taylor &amp; Francis]], 1988 ISBN 0-415-00728-3&lt;/ref&gt;Soon after the bookshop reading, plans were hatched for the [[International Poetry Incarnation]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref-2&quot;/&gt; which was held at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London on June 11, 1965</span>
				<span class='text'>The event attracted an audience of 7,000, who heard readings and live and tape performances by a wide variety of figures, including Ginsberg, [[Adrian Mitchell]], [[Alexander Trocchi]], [[Harry Fainlight]], [[Anselm Hollo]], [[Christopher Logue]], [[George Macbeth]], Gregory Corso, [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]], [[Michael Horovitz]], [[Simon Vinkenoog]], [[Spike Hawkins]] and [[Thomas McGrath (poet)|Tom McGrath]]</span>

				<span class='text'>, the term &quot;Beat Generation&quot; has become associated with many of the other poets Ginsberg met and became friends with in the late 1950s and early 1960s</span>
				<span class='text'>A key feature of this term seems to be a friendship with Ginsberg</span>
				<span class='text'>Friendship with Kerouac or Burroughs might also apply, but both writers later strove to disassociate themselves from the name &quot;Beat Generation</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Part of their dissatisfaction with the term came from the mistaken identification of Ginsberg as the leader</span>
				<span class='text'>Ginsberg never claimed to be the leader of a movement</span>

				<span class='text'>I began chanting it, in Vancouver at a great poetry conference, for the first time in '63, with Duncan and Olson and everybody around, and then continued</span>
				<span class='text'>When Bhaktivedanta arrived on the Lower East Side in '66 it was reinforcement for me, like 'the reinforcements had arrived' from India</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt; He often accompanied himself on a [[Pump organ|harmonium]], and was often accompanied by a guitarist</span>
				<span class='text'>It is believed that the Hindi and Buddhist poet [[Nagarjun]]a had introduced Ginsberg to the harmonium in Banaras</span>

				<span class='text'>In the mid-1950s, no reputable publishing company would even consider publishing &quot;Howl&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'> At the time, such &quot;sex talk&quot; employed in &quot;Howl&quot; was considered by some to be vulgar or even a form of pornography, and could be prosecuted under law</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Ginsberg used phrases such as &quot;cocksucker&quot;, &quot;fucked in the ass&quot;, and &quot;cunt&quot; as part of the poem's depiction of different aspects of American culture</span>
				<span class='text'>Numerous books that discussed sex were banned at the time, including ''[[Lady Chatterley’s Lover]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Raskin /&gt; The sex that Ginsberg painted did not portray the sex between heterosexual married couples, or even long time lovers</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, Ginsberg portrayed casual sex</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Raskin /&gt; For example, in &quot;Howl&quot;, Ginsberg praises the man &quot;who sweetened the snatches of a million girls&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Ginsberg used gritty descriptions and explicit sexual language, pointing out the man &quot;who lounged hungry and lonesome through Houston seeking jazz or sex or soup</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; In his poetry, Ginsberg also discussed the then-taboo topic of homosexuality</span>
				<span class='text'>The explicit sexual language that filled &quot;Howl&quot; eventually led to an important trial on [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] issues</span>
				<span class='text'>Ginsberg's publisher was brought up on charges for publishing pornography, and the outcome led to a judge going on record dismissing charges because the poem carried &quot;redeeming social importance&quot;,&lt;ref name=Morgan&gt;Morgan, Bill (ed</span>

				<span class='text'>nfo|publisher=[[List of pedophile and pederast advocacy organizations#International|Ipce]]|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, Ginsberg appeared in a documentary on NAMBLA called ''[[Chicken Hawk: Men Who Love Boys]]'' (playing on [[Chickenhawk (gay slang)|the gay male slang term &quot;Chickenhawk&quot;]]), in which he read a &quot;graphic ode to youth&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;PedIJN&quot; /&gt;===Demystification of drugs===Ginsberg also talked often about drug use</span>
				<span class='text'>Throughout the 1960s he took an active role in the demystification of LSD, and, with [[Timothy Leary]], worked to promote its common use</span>
				<span class='text'>He was also for many decades an advocate of [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] legalization, and, at the same time, warned his audiences against the hazards of tobacco in his ''Put Down Your Cigarette Rag (Don't Smoke):'' &quot;Don't Smoke Don't Smoke Nicotine Nicotine No / No don't smoke the official Dope Smoke Dope Dope</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;=== CIA drug trafficking==={{See also|Allegations of CIA drug trafficking}}Through his own drug use, and the drug use of his friends and associates, Ginsberg became more and more preoccupied with the American government's relationship to drug use within and outside the nation</span>
				<span class='text'>He worked closely with Alfred W</span>
				<span class='text'>McCoy who was writing ''The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia'' which tracked the history of the American government's involvement in illegal opium dealing around the world</span>
				<span class='text'>This would affirm Ginsberg's suspicions that the government and the CIA were involved in drug trafficking</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition to working with McCoy, Ginsberg personally confronted [[Richard Helms]], the director of the CIA in the 1970s, but he was simply brushed off as being &quot;full of beans&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Allen wrote many essays and articles, researching and compiling evidence of CIA's involvement, but it would take ten years, and the publication of McCoy's book in 1972, before anyone took him seriously</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1978 Ginsberg received a note from the chief editor of the ''[[New York Times]]'', apologizing for not taking his allegations seriously so many years previous</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[#Morgan|Morgan]], pp</span>
				<span class='text'>470–477</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The political subject is dealt with in his song/poem &quot;CIA Dope calypso&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>=Work==Though early on Ginsberg had intentions to be a labor lawyer, he wrote poetry for most of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>Most of his very early poetry was written in formal rhyme and meter like that of his father or his idol [[William Blake]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His admiration for the writing of Jack Kerouac inspired him to take poetry more seriously</span>
				<span class='text'>Though he took odd jobs to support himself, in 1955, upon the advice of a psychiatrist, Ginsberg dropped out of the working world to devote his entire life to poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon after, he wrote &quot;Howl&quot;, the poem that brought him and his friends much fame and allowed him to live as a professional poet for the rest of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>Later in life, Ginsberg entered academia, teaching poetry as Distinguished Professor of English at [[Brooklyn College]] from 1986 until his death</span>
				<span class='text'>==Inspiration from friends===Since Ginsberg's poetry is intensely personal, and since much of the vitality of those associated with the [[beat generation]] comes from mutual inspiration, much credit for style, inspiration, and content can be given to Ginsberg's friends</span>
				<span class='text'>insberg claimed throughout his life that his biggest inspiration was Kerouac's concept of &quot;spontaneous prose&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He believed literature should come from the soul without conscious restrictions</span>
				<span class='text'>Ginsberg was much more prone to revise than Kerouac</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, when Kerouac saw the first draft of &quot;Howl&quot; he disliked the fact that Ginsberg had made editorial changes in pencil (transposing &quot;negro&quot; and &quot;angry&quot; in the first line, for example)</span>
				<span class='text'>Kerouac only wrote out his concepts of Spontaneous Prose at Ginsberg's insistence because Ginsberg wanted to learn how to apply the technique to his poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Miles&quot;/&gt;[[File:Carl Solomon, Patti Smith, Allen Ginsberg and William S</span>
				<span class='text'>Burroughs</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|[[Carl Solomon]], [[Patti Smith]], Allen Ginsberg and [[William S</span>
				<span class='text'>Burroughs]], 1977]]The inspiration for &quot;Howl&quot; was Ginsberg's friend, [[Carl Solomon]], and &quot;Howl&quot; is dedicated to Solomon (whom Ginsberg also directly addresses in the third section of the poem)</span>
				<span class='text'>Solomon was a [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]] enthusiast (he introduced Ginsberg to [[Artaud]]) who suffered bouts of depression</span>
				<span class='text'>Solomon wanted to commit suicide, but he thought a form of suicide appropriate to dadaism would be to go to a mental institution and demand a lobotomy</span>
				<span class='text'>The institution refused, giving him many forms of [[psychotherapy|therapy]], including [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroshock therapy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Much of the final section of the first part of &quot;Howl&quot; is a description of this</span>
				<span class='text'>insberg used Solomon as an example of all those ground down by the machine of &quot;[[Moloch]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Moloch, to whom the second section is addressed, is a [[Semitic gods|Levantine god]] to whom children were sacrificed</span>
				<span class='text'>Ginsberg may have gotten the name from the [[Kenneth Rexroth]] poem &quot;Thou Shalt Not Kill&quot;, a poem about the death of one of Ginsberg's heroes, [[Dylan Thomas]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Moloch is mentioned a few times in the [[Torah]] and references to Ginsberg's Jewish background are not infrequent in his work</span>
				<span class='text'>Ginsberg said the image of Moloch was inspired by [[peyote]] visions he had of the Francis Drake Hotel in San Francisco which appeared to him as a skull; he took it as a symbol of the city (not specifically San Francisco, but all cities)</span>
				<span class='text'>Ginsberg later acknowledged in various publications and interviews that behind the visions of the Francis Drake Hotel were memories of the Moloch of [[Fritz Lang]]'s film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1927) and of the woodcut novels of [[Lynd Ward]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ginsberg, Allen (1986) ''Howl: Original Draft Facsimile, Transcript &amp; Variant Versions,'' Barry Miles (ed</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>New York: Harper</span>
				<span class='text'>pp</span>
				<span class='text'>139–140</span>
				<span class='text'>Ward also illustrated a later broadside version of &quot;Howl&quot;, which can be seen in the cited pages</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Moloch has subsequently been interpreted as any system of control, including the conformist society of post–World War II America, focused on material gain, which Ginsberg frequently blamed for the destruction of all those outside of societal norms</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Miles&quot;/&gt;He also made sure to emphasize that Moloch is a part of all of us: the decision to ''defy'' socially created systems of control—and therefore go against Moloch—is a form of self-destruction</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of the characters Ginsberg references in &quot;Howl&quot;, such as Neal Cassady and Herbert Huncke, destroyed themselves through excessive substance abuse or a generally wild lifestyle</span>
				<span class='text'>The personal aspects of &quot;Howl&quot; are perhaps as important as the political aspects</span>
				<span class='text'>Carl Solomon, the prime example of a &quot;best mind&quot; destroyed by defying society, is associated with Ginsberg's schizophrenic mother: the line &quot;with mother finally ****** (fucked)&quot; comes after a long section about Carl Solomon, and in Part III, Ginsberg says: &quot;I'm with you in Rockland where you imitate the shade of my mother</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Ginsberg later admitted that the drive to write &quot;Howl&quot; was fueled by sympathy for his ailing mother, an issue which he was not yet ready to deal with directly</span>
				<span class='text'>He dealt with it directly with 1959's &quot;Kaddish&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Miles&quot;/&gt; which had its first public reading at a [[Catholic Worker Movement|Catholic Worker]] Friday Night meeting, possibly due to its associations with [[Thomas Merton]]</span>

				<span class='text'>tm |archivedate=March 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;===Inspiration from mentors and idols===Ginsberg's poetry was strongly influenced by [[Modernism]] (most importantly the American style of Modernism pioneered by William Carlos Williams), [[Romanticism]] (specifically William Blake and [[John Keats]]), the beat and cadence of [[jazz]] (specifically that of [[Bebop|bop]] musicians such as [[Charlie Parker]]), and his [[Kagyu]] [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] practice and Jewish background</span>
				<span class='text'>He considered himself to have inherited the visionary poetic mantle handed down from the English poet and artist William Blake, the American poet Walt Whitman and the Spanish poet [[Federico Garcia Lorca]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The power of Ginsberg's verse, its searching, probing focus, its long and lilting lines, as well as its [[New World]] exuberance, all echo the continuity of inspiration that he claimed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Miles&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Deliberate&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Spontaneous/&gt;He corresponded with William Carlos Williams, who was then in the middle of writing his epic poem [[Paterson (poem)|Paterson]] about the industrial city near his home</span>
				<span class='text'>After attending a reading by Williams, Ginsberg sent the older poet several of his poems and wrote an introductory letter</span>
				<span class='text'>Most of these early poems were rhymed and metered and included archaic pronouns like &quot;thee</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Williams disliked the poems and told Ginsberg, &quot;In this mode perfection is basic, and these poems are not perfect</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Miles&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Deliberate&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Spontaneous&quot;/&gt;Though he disliked these early poems, Williams loved the exuberance in Ginsberg's letter</span>
				<span class='text'>He included the letter in a later part of ''Paterson''</span>
				<span class='text'>He encouraged Ginsberg not to emulate the old masters, but to speak with his own voice and the voice of the common American</span>
				<span class='text'>From Williams, Ginsberg learned to focus on strong visual images, in line with Williams' own motto &quot;No ideas but in things</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Studying Williams' style led to a tremendous shift from the early formalist work to a loose, colloquial free verse style</span>
				<span class='text'>Early breakthrough poems include ''Bricklayer's Lunch Hour'' and ''Dream Record''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Miles&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Spontaneous&quot;/&gt;Carl Solomon introduced Ginsberg to the work of Antonin Artaud (''To Have Done with the Judgement of God'' and ''Van Gogh: The Man Suicided by Society''), and Jean Genet (''Our Lady of the Flowers'')</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Philip Lamantia]] introduced him to other [[Surrealists]] and Surrealism continued to be an influence (for example, sections of &quot;Kaddish&quot; were inspired by [[André Breton]]'s ''Free Union'')</span>
				<span class='text'>Ginsberg claimed that the anaphoric repetition of &quot;Howl&quot; and other poems was inspired by Christopher Smart in such poems as ''Jubilate Agno''</span>
				<span class='text'>Ginsberg also claimed other more traditional influences, such as: [[Franz Kafka]], [[Herman Melville]], [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], and even [[Emily Dickinson]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Miles&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Deliberate&quot;/&gt;Ginsberg also made an intense study of [[haiku]] and the paintings of [[Paul Cézanne]], from which he adapted a concept important to his work, which he called the ''Eyeball Kick''</span>
				<span class='text'>He noticed in viewing Cézanne's paintings that when the eye moved from one color to a contrasting color, the eye would [[Saccade|spasm]], or &quot;kick</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Likewise, he discovered that the contrast of two seeming opposites was a common feature in haiku</span>
				<span class='text'>Ginsberg used this technique in his poetry, putting together two starkly dissimilar images: something weak with something strong, an artifact of high culture with an artifact of low culture, something holy with something unholy</span>
				<span class='text'>The example Ginsberg most often used was &quot;hydrogen jukebox&quot; (which later became the title of a [[song cycle]] composed by [[Philip Glass]] with lyrics drawn from Ginsberg's poems)</span>
				<span class='text'>Another example is Ginsberg's observation on Bob Dylan during Dylan's hectic and intense 1966 electric-guitar tour, fuelled by a cocktail of amphetamines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>He frequently included music in his poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote and recorded music to accompany William Blake’s ''Songs of Innocence'' and ''Songs of Experience''</span>
				<span class='text'>He also recorded a hand full of other albums</span>
				<span class='text'>To create music for ''Howl'' and ''Wichita Vortex Sutra'' he worked with the neo-classical composer, Philip Glass</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Howl&quot; came out during a potentially hostile literary environment, less welcoming to non-traditional, free verse poetry; there was a renewed focus on form and structure among academic poets and critics partly inspired by [[New Criticism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Consequently, Ginsberg often had to defend his choice to employ long, free verse lines, often citing Whitman's free verse used in ''Leaves of Grass'' as a precursor</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Ginsberg claimed Whitman's long line was a dynamic technique few other poets had ventured to develop further, and Whitman is also often compared to Ginsberg because their poetry sexualized aspects of the male form</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Miles&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Deliberate&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Spontaneous&quot;/&gt;Ginsberg believed strongly that traditional formalist considerations were archaic and did not apply to reality</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Though some critics, like Diana Trilling, have pointed to Ginsberg's occasional use of meter (for example the anapest of &quot;who came back to Denver and waited in vain&quot;), Ginsberg denied any intention toward meter and claimed instead that his idea of meter followed the &quot;natural&quot; poetic voice</span>
				<span class='text'>{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}Ginsberg said that he learned from William Carlos Williams that natural speech is occasionally dactylic so poetry that imitates natural speech will sometimes fall into a dactylic structure but only accidentally</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Like Williams, Ginsberg's line breaks were often determined by breath: one line in &quot;Howl&quot;, for example, should be read in one breath</span>
				<span class='text'>Ginsberg claimed he developed such a long line because he had long breaths</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=August 2012}}Many of Ginsberg's early long line experiments contain some sort of [[Anaphora (rhetoric)|anaphora]], repetition of a &quot;fixed base&quot; (for example &quot;who&quot; in &quot;Howl&quot;, &quot;America&quot; in ''America'') and this has become a recognizable feature of Ginsberg's style</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=August 2012}}  He said later this was a crutch because he lacked confidence; he did not yet trust &quot;free flight&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=August 2012}} In the 1960s, after employing it in some sections of &quot;Kaddish&quot; (&quot;caw&quot; for example) he, for the most part, abandoned the anaphoric form</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Deliberate&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Spontaneous&quot;/&gt;Several of his earlier experiments with methods for formatting poems as a whole became regular aspects of his style in later poems</span>
				<span class='text'>In the original draft of &quot;Howl&quot;, each line is in a &quot;stepped triadic&quot; format reminiscent of [[William Carlos Williams]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=August 2012}} But he abandoned the &quot;stepped triadic&quot; when he developed his long line although the stepped lines showed up later, most significantly in the travelogues of ''The Fall of America</span>
				<span class='text'>'{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} &quot;Howl&quot; and &quot;Kaddish&quot;, arguably his two most important poems, are both organized as an inverted pyramid, with larger sections leading to smaller sections</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''America'', he also experimented with a mix of longer and shorter lines</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Deliberate&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Spontaneous&quot;/&gt;In &quot;Howl&quot; and in his other poetry, Ginsberg drew inspiration from the [[epic poetry|epic]], [[free verse]] style of the 19th-century American poet [[Walt Whitman]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ginsberg, Allen ''Deliberate Prose'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>285–331</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Both wrote passionately about the promise (and betrayal) of American democracy, the central importance of erotic experience, and the spiritual quest for the truth of everyday existence</span>
				<span class='text'>[[J</span>
				<span class='text'>D</span>
				<span class='text'>McClatchy]], editor of the ''[[Yale Review]]'', called Ginsberg &quot;the best-known American poet of his generation, as much a social force as a literary phenomenon</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; McClatchy added that Ginsberg, like Whitman, &quot;was a bard in the old manner – outsized, darkly prophetic, part exuberance, part prayer, part rant</span>
				<span class='text'>His work is finally a history of our era's psyche, with all its contradictory urges</span>
