				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>and flown to London, where the BBC broadcast them  to Germany on the [[longwave]] band</span>
				<span class='text'>In these eight-minute addresses, Mann condemned Hitler and his &quot;paladins&quot; as crude philistines completely out of touch with European culture</span>
				<span class='text'>In one noted speech he said, &quot;The war is horrible, but it has the advantage of keeping Hitler from making speeches about culture</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In 1930, Mann gave a public address in Berlin titled &quot;An Appeal to Reason&quot;, in which he strongly denounced [[Nazism|National Socialism]] and encouraged resistance by the working class</span>
				<span class='text'>This was followed by numerous essays and lectures in which he attacked the Nazis</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time, he expressed increasing sympathy for socialist ideas</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1933 when the Nazis came to power, Mann and his wife were on holiday in [[Switzerland]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Due to his strident denunciations of Nazi policies, his son Klaus advised him not to return</span>
				<span class='text'>But Thomas Mann's books, in contrast to those of his brother Heinrich and his son Klaus, were not among those burnt publicly by [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler's]] regime in May 1933, possibly since he had been the Nobel laureate in literature for 1929</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally in 1936 the Nazi government officially revoked his German citizenship</span>
				<span class='text'>uring the war, Mann made a series of anti-Nazi radio-speeches, [[Listen, Germany!|Deutsche Hörer!'' (&quot;German listeners!&quot;)]]</span>
				<span class='text'>They were taped in the USA and then sent to Great Britain, where the [[BBC]] transmitted them, hoping to reach German listeners</span>
