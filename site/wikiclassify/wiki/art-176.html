				<span class='text'>The term ''Kafkaesque'' has entered the English language to describe situations like those in his writing</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Steinhauer|1983|pp = 390–408}}Kafka was born into a middle-class, German-speaking [[Ashkenazi Jews|Jewish]] family in [[Prague]], the capital of the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]], then part of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He trained as a lawyer, and after completing his legal education he obtained employment with an insurance company while writing in his spare time; for the rest of his life he was to complain about how little time he had to devote to his passion due to the demands of his ''{{lang|de|Brotberuf}}'' (&quot;day job&quot;, literally &quot;bread job&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>Over the course of his life, Kafka wrote hundreds of letters to family and close friends, including his father, with whom he had a strained and formal relationship</span>
				<span class='text'>He died in 1924 at the age of 40 from tuberculosis</span>
				<span class='text'>ew of Kafka's works were published during his lifetime: the story collections ''{{lang|de|[[Contemplation (Kafka)|Betrachtung]]}}'' (''Contemplation'') and ''{{lang|de|[[A Country Doctor (collection)|Ein Landarzt]]}}'' (''A Country Doctor''), and individual stories (such as &quot;{{lang|de|Die Verwandlung}}&quot;) were published in literary magazines but received little public attention</span>
				<span class='text'>Kafka's unfinished works, including his novels ''{{lang|de|Der Process}}'', ''{{lang|de|Das Schloss}}'' and ''{{lang|de|[[Amerika (novel)|Amerika]]}}'' (also known as ''{{lang|de|Der Verschollene}}'', ''The Man Who Disappeared''), were ordered by Kafka to be destroyed by his friend [[Max Brod]], who nonetheless ignored his friend's direction and published them after Kafka's death</span>

				<span class='text'>His family were middle-class [[Ashkenazi Jews]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His father, Hermann Kafka (1852–1931), was the fourth child of Jakob Kafka,{{sfn|Gilman|2005|pp = 20–21}}{{sfn|Northey|1997|pp = 8–10}} a ''{{lang|he|shochet}}'' or [[Shechita|ritual slaughterer]] in [[Osek (Strakonice District)|Osek]], a Czech village with a large Jewish population located near [[Strakonice]] in southern Bohemia</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Kohoutikriz|2011}} Hermann brought the Kafka family to Prague</span>
				<span class='text'>After working as a travelling sales representative, he eventually became a fancy goods and clothing retailer who employed up to 15 people and used the image of a [[Western Jackdaw|jackdaw]] (''{{lang|cz|kavka}}'' in Czech, pronounced and colloquially written as ''kafka'') as his business logo</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Brod|1960|pp = 3–5}} Kafka's mother, Julie (1856–1934), was the daughter of Jakob Löwy, a prosperous retail merchant in [[Poděbrady]],{{sfn|Northey|1997|p = 92}} and was better educated than her husband</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Gilman|2005|pp = 20–21}}Kafka's parents probably spoke a variety of German influenced by [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] that was sometimes pejoratively called [[Yiddish language#Secularization|Mauscheldeutsch]], but, as the German language was considered the vehicle of social mobility, they probably encouraged their children to speak [[High German languages|High German]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Gray|2005|pp = 147–148}} Hermann and Julie had six children, of whom Franz was the eldest</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Hamalian|1974|p = 3}} Franz's two brothers, Georg and Heinrich, died in infancy before Franz was seven; his three sisters were Gabriele (&quot;Ellie&quot;) (1889–1944), Valerie (&quot;Valli&quot;) (1890–1942) and [[Ottla Kafka|Ottilie]] (&quot;Ottla&quot;) (1892–1943)</span>
				<span class='text'>They all died during the [[Holocaust]] of World War II</span>
				<span class='text'>Valli was deported to the [[Łódź Ghetto]] in Poland in 1942, but that is the last documentation of her</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;!-- cite here? --&gt;Hermann is described by the biographer Stanley Corngold as a &quot;huge, selfish, overbearing businessman&quot;{{sfn|Corngold|1972|pp = xii, 11}} and by Franz Kafka as &quot;a true Kafka in strength, health, appetite, loudness of voice, eloquence, self-satisfaction, worldly dominance, endurance, presence of mind, [and] knowledge of human nature&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Kafka-Franz, Father|2012}} On business days, both parents were absent from the home, with Julie Kafka working as many as 12&amp;nbsp;hours each day helping to manage the family business</span>
				<span class='text'>Consequently, Kafka's childhood was somewhat lonely,{{sfn|Brod|1960|p = 9}} and the children were reared largely by a series of governesses and servants</span>
				<span class='text'>Kafka's troubled relationship&lt;!-- abrupt shift to troubled relationship here; suggest moving down later b/c more to do with later life --&gt;&lt;!-- - the father issues have roots in early life, which is why it was put here - --&gt; with his father is evident in his ''{{lang|de|[[Letter to His Father|Brief an den Vater]]}}'' (''Letter to His Father'') of more than 100&amp;nbsp;pages, in which he complains of being profoundly affected by his father's authoritarian and demanding character;{{sfn|Brod|1960|pp = 15–16}} his mother, in contrast, was quiet and shy</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Brod|1960|pp = 19–20}} The dominating figure of Kafka's father had a significant influence on Kafka's writing</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Brod|1960|pp = 15, 17, 22–23}}The Kafka family had a servant girl living with them in a cramped apartment</span>
				<span class='text'>Franz's room was often cold</span>
				<span class='text'>In November 1913 the family moved into a bigger apartment, although Ellie and Valli had married and moved out of the first apartment</span>
				<span class='text'>In early August 1914, just after World War I began, the sisters did not know where their husbands were in the military and moved back in with the family in this larger apartment</span>
				<span class='text'>Both Ellie and Valli also had children</span>
				<span class='text'>Franz at age 31 moved into Valli's former apartment, quiet by contrast, and lived by himself for the first time</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Stach|2005|pp = 390–391, 462–463}}=== Education ===From 1889 to 1893, Kafka attended the ''{{lang|de|Deutsche Knabenschule}}'' German boys' elementary school at the ''{{lang|cz|Masný trh/Fleischmarkt}}'' (meat market), now known as Masná Street</span>
				<span class='text'>His Jewish education ended with his [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|Bar Mitzvah]] celebration at the age of 13</span>
				<span class='text'>Kafka never enjoyed attending the synagogue and went with his father only on four high holidays a year</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|[[Kinský Palace (Prague)|Kinský Palace]] where Kafka attended gymnasium and his father owned a shop|alt=An ornate four-storey palatial building]]After leaving elementary school in 1893, Kafka was admitted to the rigorous classics-oriented state [[Gymnasium (Germany)|gymnasium]], ''{{lang|de|Altstädter Deutsches Gymnasium}}'', an academic secondary school at Old Town Square, within the [[Kinský Palace (Prague)|Kinský Palace]]</span>
				<span class='text'>German was the language of instruction, but Kafka also spoke and wrote in Czech</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Hawes|2008|p = 29}}{{sfn|Sayer|1996|pp = 164–210}} He studied the latter at the gymnasium for eight years, achieving good grades</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Kempf|2005|pp = 159–160}} Although Kafka received compliments for his Czech, he never considered himself fluent in Czech, though he spoke German with a Czech accent</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Koelb|2010|p = 12}}{{sfn|Sayer|1996|pp = 164–210}} He completed his [[Matura]] exams in 1901</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Corngold|2004|p = xii}}Admitted to the ''{{lang|de|[[German Charles-Ferdinand University|Deutsche Karl-Ferdinands-Universität]]}}'' of Prague in 1901, Kafka began studying chemistry, but switched to law after two weeks</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Diamant|2003|pp = 36–38}} Although this field did not excite him, it offered a range of career possibilities which pleased his father</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, law required a longer course of study, giving Kafka time to take classes in German studies and art history</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Brod|1960|pp = 40–41}} He also joined a student club, ''{{lang|de|Lese-und Redehalle der Deutschen Studenten}}'' (Reading and Lecture Hall of the German students), which organized literary events, readings and other activities</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Gray|2005|p = 179}} Among Kafka's friends were the journalist [[Felix Weltsch]], who studied philosophy, the actor [[Yitzchak Lowy]] who came from an orthodox [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] Warsaw family, and the writers [[Oskar Baum]] and [[Franz Werfel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Stach|2005|pp = 43–70}}At the end of his first year of studies, Kafka met [[Max Brod]], a fellow law student who became a close friend for life</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Gray|2005|p = 179}} Brod soon noticed that, although Kafka was shy and seldom spoke, what he said was usually profound</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Brod|1960|p = 40}} Kafka was an avid reader throughout his life;{{sfn|Brod|1960|p = 14}} together he and Brod read Plato's ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]'' in the original [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], on Brod's initiative, and [[Flaubert]]'s ''{{lang|fr|[[Sentimental Education|L'éducation sentimentale]]}}'' and ''{{lang|fr|[[The Temptation of Saint Anthony (Flaubert)|La Tentation de St</span>
				<span class='text'>Antoine]]}}'' (''The Temptation of Saint Anthony'') in French, at his own suggestion</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Brod|1966|pp = 53–54}} Kafka considered [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], Flaubert, Nikolai Gogol, [[Franz Grillparzer]],{{sfn|Stach|2005|p = 362}} and [[Heinrich von Kleist]] to be his &quot;true [[blood brother]]s&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Gray|2005|pp = 74, 273}} Besides these, he took an interest in [[Czech literature]]{{sfn|Hawes|2008|p = 29}}{{sfn|Sayer|1996|pp = 164–210}} and was also very fond of the works of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Brod|1960|pp = 51, 122–124}}{{sfn|Stach|2005|pp = 80–83}} Kafka obtained the degree of Doctor of Law on 18 July 1906{{efn|Some sources list June (Murray) as Kafka's graduation month and some list July (Brod)</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Murray|2004|p=62}}{{sfn|Brod|1960|p=78}}}} and performed an obligatory year of unpaid service as law clerk for the civil and criminal courts</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Steinhauer|1983|pp = 390–408}}=== Employment ===[[File:Na Porici 7, Prague</span>
				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|Former home of the Worker's Accident Insurance Institute]]On 1 November 1907, Kafka was hired at the ''{{lang|it|[[Assicurazioni Generali]]}}'', an Italian insurance company, where he worked for nearly a year</span>
				<span class='text'>His correspondence during that period indicates that he was unhappy with a working time schedule—from 08:00 until 18:00{{sfn|Karl|1991|p = 210}}{{sfn|Glen|2007|pp = 23–66}}—making it extremely difficult to concentrate on writing, which was assuming increasing importance to him</span>
				<span class='text'>On 15 July 1908, he resigned</span>
				<span class='text'>Two weeks later he found employment more amenable to writing when he joined the [[Workers' compensation|Worker's Accident Insurance Institute]] for the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The job involved investigating and assessing compensation for [[personal injury]] to industrial workers; accidents such as lost fingers or limbs were commonplace at this time</span>
				<span class='text'>The management professor [[Peter Drucker]] credits Kafka with developing the first civilian [[hard hat]] while employed at the Worker's Accident Insurance Institute, but this is not supported by any document from his employer</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Drucker|2002|p = 24}}{{sfn|Corngold et al</span>
				<span class='text'>2009|pp = 250–254}} His father often referred to his son's job as an insurance officer as a ''{{lang|de|Brotberuf}}'', literally &quot;bread job&quot;, a job done only to pay the bills; Kafka often claimed to despise it</span>
				<span class='text'>Kafka was rapidly promoted and his duties included processing and investigating compensation claims, writing reports, and handling appeals from businessmen who thought their firms had been placed in too high a risk category, which cost them more in insurance premiums</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Stach|2005|pp = 26–30}} He would compile and compose the [[annual report]] on the insurance institute for the several years he worked there</span>
				<span class='text'>The reports were received well by his superiors</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Brod|1960|pp = 81–84}} Kafka usually got off work at 2 p</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> so that he had time to spend on his literary work, to which he was committed</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Stach|2005|pp = 23–25}} Kafka's father also expected him to help out at and take over the family fancy goods store</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Stach|2005|pp = 25–27}} In his later years, Kafka's illness often prevented him from working at the insurance bureau and at his writing</span>
				<span class='text'>Years later, Brod coined the term ''{{lang|de|Der enge Prager Kreis}}'' (&quot;The Close Prague Circle&quot;) to describe the group of writers, which included Kafka, Felix Weltsch and him</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Spector|2000|p = 17}}{{sfn|Keren|1993|p = 3}}In late 1911, Elli's husband Karl Hermann and Kafka became partners in the first [[asbestos]] factory in Prague, known as Prager Asbestwerke Hermann &amp; Co</span>
				<span class='text'> having used dowry money from Hermann Kafka</span>
				<span class='text'>Kafka showed a positive attitude at first, dedicating much of his free time to the business, but he later resented the encroachment of this work on his writing time</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Stach|2005|pp = 34–39}} During that period, he also found interest and entertainment in the performances of [[Yiddish theatre]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After seeing a Yiddish theater troupe perform in October 1911, for the next six months Kafka &quot;immersed himself in Yiddish language and in Yiddish literature&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Koelb|2010|p = 32}} This interest also served as a starting point for his growing exploration of Judaism</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Stach|2005|pp = 56–58}} It was at about this time that Kafka became a vegetarian</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Brod|1960|pp = 29, 73–75, 109–110, 206}} Around 1915 Kafka received his draft notice for military service in World War{{nbsp}}I, but his employers at the insurance institute arranged for a deferment because his work was considered essential government service</span>
				<span class='text'>Later he attempted to join the military but was prevented from doing so by medical problems associated with [[tuberculosis]],{{sfn|Brod|1960|p = 154}} with which he was diagnosed in 1917</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Corngold|2011|pp = 339–343}} In 1918 the Worker's Accident Insurance Institute put Kafka on a pension due to his illness, for which there was no cure at the time, and he spent most of the rest of his life in sanatoriums</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Steinhauer|1983|pp = 390–408}}=== Private life ===Kafka was never married</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Brod, Kafka was &quot;tortured&quot; by sexual desire{{sfn|Hawes|2008|p = 186}} and Kafka's biographer [[Reiner Stach]] states that his life was full of &quot;incessant womanising&quot; and that he was filled with a fear of &quot;sexual failure&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Stach|2005|pp = 44, 207}} He visited brothels for most of his adult life{{sfn|Hawes|2008|pp = 186, 191}}{{sfn|European Graduate School|2012}}{{sfn|Stach|2005|p = 43}} and was interested in pornography</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Hawes|2008|p = 186}} In addition, he had close relationships with several women during his life</span>
				<span class='text'>On 13 August 1912, Kafka met [[Felice Bauer]], a relative of Brod, who worked in Berlin as a representative of a [[dictaphone]] company</span>
				<span class='text'>A week after the meeting at Brod's home, Kafka wrote in his diary:{{quote|Miss FB</span>
				<span class='text'>When I arrived at Brod's on 13 August, she was sitting at the table</span>
				<span class='text'>I was not at all curious about who she was, but rather took her for granted at once</span>
				<span class='text'>Bony, empty face that wore its emptiness openly</span>
				<span class='text'>Bare throat</span>
				<span class='text'>A blouse thrown on</span>
				<span class='text'>Looked very domestic in her dress although, as it turned out, she by no means was</span>
				<span class='text'>(I alienate myself from her a little by inspecting her so closely&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> Almost broken nose</span>
				<span class='text'>Blonde, somewhat straight, unattractive hair, strong chin</span>
				<span class='text'>As I was taking my seat I looked at her closely for the first time, by the time I was seated I already had an unshakeable opinion</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Banville|2011}}{{sfn|Köhler|2012}}}}Shortly after this, Kafka wrote the story &quot;{{lang|de|[[The Judgment|Das Urteil]]}}&quot; (&quot;The Judgment&quot;) in only one night and worked in a productive period on ''{{lang|de|[[Amerika (novel)|Der Verschollene]]}}'' (''The Man Who Disappeared'') and &quot;[[The Metamorphosis|Die Verwandlung]]&quot; (&quot;The Metamorphosis&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>Kafka and Felice Bauer communicated mostly through letters over the next five years, met occasionally, and were engaged twice</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Stach|2005|p = 1}} Kafka's extant letters to her were published as ''{{lang|de|[[Letters to Felice|Briefe an Felice]]}}'' (''Letters to Felice''); her letters do not survive</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Banville|2011}}{{sfn|Seubert|2012}}{{sfn|Brod|1960|pp = 196–197}} According to biographers Stach and [[James Hawes (author)|James Hawes]], around 1920 Kafka was engaged a third time, to Julie Wohryzek, a poor and uneducated hotel chambermaid</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Stach|2005|p = 1}}{{sfn|Hawes|2008|pp = 129, 198–199}} Although the two rented a flat and set a wedding date, the marriage never took place</span>
				<span class='text'>During this time Kafka began a draft of the ''Letter to His Father'', who objected to Julie because of her [[Zionism|Zionist]] beliefs</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Kirsch|2009}}=== Translation problems to English ==={{further|Franz Kafka works}}Kafka often made extensive use of a characteristic particular to the German language which permits long sentences that sometimes can span an entire page</span>
				<span class='text'>Kafka's sentences then deliver an unexpected impact just before the full stop—this being the finalizing meaning and focus</span>
				<span class='text'>This is due to the construction of [[subordinate clauses in German]] which require that the verb be positioned at the end of the sentence</span>
				<span class='text'>Such constructions are difficult to duplicate in English, so it is up to the translator to provide the reader with the same (or at least equivalent) effect found in the original text</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Kafka|1996|p = xi}} German's more flexible word order and syntactical differences provide for multiple ways in which the same German writing can be translated into English</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Newmark|1991|pp = 63–64}} An example is the first sentence of Kafka's &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot;, which is crucial to the setting and understanding of the entire story:{{sfn|Bloom|2003|pp = 23–26}}{{quote|''{{lang|de|Als Gregor Samsa eines Morgens aus unruhigen Träumen erwachte, fand er sich in seinem Bett zu einem ungeheuren Ungeziefer verwandelt}}''</span>

				<span class='text'>(literal word-for-word translation){{sfn|Prinsky|2002}}}}Another virtually insurmountable problem facing translators is how to deal with the author's intentional use of ambiguous idioms and words that have several meanings which result in phrasing difficult to precisely translate</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lawson|1960|pp = 216–219}}{{sfn|Rhine|1989|pp = 447–458}} One such instance is found in the first sentence of [[The Metamorphosis#Lost in translation|&quot;The Metamorphosis&quot;]]</span>
				<span class='text'>English translators often render the word ''{{lang|de|Ungeziefer}}'' as &quot;insect&quot;; in Middle German, however, ''{{lang|de|Ungeziefer}}'' literally means &quot;an animal unclean for sacrifice&quot;;{{sfn|Corngold|1973|p = 10}} in today's German it means vermin</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;!-- Brod referred to it as Insekt, though</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Brod|1960|p=? will add when source is found again}} --&gt; It is sometimes used colloquially to mean &quot;bug&quot;&amp;nbsp;—a very general term, unlike the scientific &quot;insect&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Kafka had no intention of labeling Gregor, the protagonist of the story, as any specific thing, but instead wanted to convey Gregor's disgust at his transformation</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Sokel|1956|pp = 203–214}}{{sfn|Luke|1951|pp = 232–245}} Another example is Kafka's use of the German noun ''{{lang|de|[[wikt:Verkehr|Verkehr]]}}'' in the final sentence of &quot;Das Urteil&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Literally, ''{{lang|de|Verkehr}}'' means intercourse and, as in English, can have either a sexual or non-sexual meaning; in addition, it is used to mean transport or traffic</span>
				<span class='text'>The sentence can be translated as: &quot;At that moment an unending stream of traffic crossed over the bridge&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Kafka|1996|p = 75}} The double meaning of ''Verkehr'' is given added weight by Kafka's confession to Brod that when he wrote that final line, he was thinking of &quot;a violent ejaculation&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>A major component of the museum is an exhibit ''The City of K</span>
				<span class='text'>Franz Kafka and Prague'', which was first shown in Barcelona in 1999, moved to the [[Jewish Museum (New York)|Jewish Museum]] in New York City, and was finally established in 2005 in Prague in [[Malá Strana]] (Lesser Town), along the [[Vltava|Moldau]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The museum calls its display of original photos and documents ''Město K</span>
				<span class='text'>Franz Kafka a Praha'' (City K</span>
				<span class='text'>Kafka and Prague) and aims to immerse the visitor into the world in which Kafka lived and about which he wrote</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Kafka Museum|2005}}The [[Franz Kafka Prize]] is an annual literary award of the Franz Kafka Society and the City of Prague established in 2001</span>
				<span class='text'>It recognizes the merits of literature as &quot;humanistic character and contribution to cultural, national, language and religious tolerance, its existential, timeless character, its generally human validity, and its ability to hand over a testimony about our times&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Kafka Society|2011}} The selection committee and recipients come from all over the world, but are limited to living authors who have had at least one work published in the Czech language</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Kafka Society|2011}} The recipient receives $10,000, a diploma, and a bronze statuette at a presentation in [[Old Town (Prague)|Prague's Old Town Hall]] on the Czech State Holiday in late October</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Kafka Society|2011}}[[San Diego State University]] (SDSU) operates the ''[[Kafka Project]]'' which began in 1998 as the official international search for Kafka's last writings</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Kafka Project SDSU|2012}}&lt;!-- The project's four-month search of government archives in Berlin in 1998 uncovered the Gestapo confiscation order from 1933 and other significant documents</span>
				<span class='text'>In 2003 the project discovered three original Kafka letters, written in 1923</span>
				<span class='text'>Building on the search conducted by Brod and Klaus Wagenbach in the mid-1950s, the project at SDSU has an advisory committee of international scholars and researchers</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=October 2012}} --&gt;=== Literary and cultural influence ===Unlike many famous writers, Kafka is rarely quoted by others</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, he is noted more for his visions and perspective</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Hawes|2008|p = 4}} Shimon Sandbank, a professor and writer, identifies Kafka as having influenced [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Albert Camus]], [[Eugène Ionesco]], [[J</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Silverman|1986|pp = 129–130}} In 1999 a committee of 99 authors, scholars, and literary critics ranked ''{{lang|de|Der Process}}'' and ''{{lang|de|Das Schloss}}'' the second and ninth [[Best German Novels of the Twentieth Century|most significant German-language novels of the 20th century]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|LiteraturHaus|1999}} Shimon Sandbank, a literary critic, argues that despite Kafka's pervasiveness, his enigmatic style has yet to be emulated</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Sandbank|1992|pp = 441–443}} Neil Christian Pages, a professor of German Studies and Comparative Literature at [[Binghamton University]] who specialises in Kafka's works, says Kafka's influence transcends literature and literary scholarship; it impacts visual arts, music, and popular culture</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Coker|2012}} Harry Steinhauer, a professor of German and Jewish literature, says that Kafka &quot;has made a more powerful impact on literate society than any other writer of the twentieth century&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Steinhauer|1983|pp = 390–408}} Brod said that the 20th century will one day be known as the &quot;century of Kafka&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Steinhauer|1983|pp = 390–408}}Michel-André Bossy writes that Kafka created a rigidly inflexible and sterile bureaucratic universe</span>
				<span class='text'>Kafka wrote in an aloof manner full of legal and scientific terms</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet his serious universe also had insightful humour, all highlighting the &quot;irrationality at the roots of a supposedly rational world&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bossy|2001|p = 100}} His characters are trapped, confused, full of guilt, frustrated, and lacking understanding of their surreal world</span>
				<span class='text'>Much of the post-Kafka fiction, especially science fiction, follow the themes and precepts of Kafka's universe</span>
				<span class='text'>This can be seen in the works of authors such as [[George Orwell]] and [[Ray Bradbury]]</span>
