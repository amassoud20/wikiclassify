				<span class='text'>He received the [[Nobel Prize for Chemistry]] in 1903, becoming the first [[Sweden|Swedish]] Nobel laureate, and in 1905 became director of the [[Nobel Institute]] where he remained until his death</span>

				<span class='text'>Today, Arrhenius is best known for his study published in 1896, on the greenhouse effect</span>
				<span class='text'>=Biography=====Early years===Arrhenius was born on February 19, 1859, at Vik (also spelled Wik or Wijk), near [[Uppsala]], Sweden, the son of Svante Gustav and Carolina Thunberg Arrhenius</span>
				<span class='text'>His father had been a [[surveying|land surveyor]] for [[Uppsala University]], moving up to a supervisory position</span>
				<span class='text'>At the age of three, Arrhenius taught himself to read without the encouragement of his parents, and by watching his father's addition of numbers in his account books, became an [[arithmetic]]al [[child prodigy|prodigy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In later life, Arrhenius enjoyed using masses of data to discover mathematical relationships and laws</span>
				<span class='text'>t age eight, he entered the local cathedral school, starting in the [[fifth grade]], distinguishing himself in [[physics]] and [[mathematics]], and graduating as the youngest and most able student in 1876</span>
				<span class='text'>==Ionic Disassociation===At the University of Uppsala, he was unsatisfied with the chief instructor of physics and the only faculty member who could have supervised him in chemistry, [[Per Teodor Cleve]], so he left to study at the Physical Institute of the Swedish Academy of Sciences in [[Stockholm]] under the physicist [[Erik Edlund]] in 1881</span>
				<span class='text'> His work focused on the [[Conductivity (electrolytic)|conductivities]] of [[electrolyte]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1884, based on this work, he submitted a 150-page dissertation on electrolytic conductivity to Uppsala for the [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It did not impress the professors, among whom was [[Per Teodor Cleve]], and he received a fourth class degree, but upon his defense it was reclassified as third class</span>
				<span class='text'>Later, extensions of this very work would earn him the [[List of Nobel laureates in Chemistry|1903 Nobel Prize in Chemistry]]</span>

				<span class='text'>rg/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1903/index</span>
				<span class='text'>tml&lt;/ref&gt;Arrhenius put forth 56 theses in his 1884 dissertation, most of which would still be accepted today unchanged or with minor modifications</span>
				<span class='text'>The most important idea in the dissertation was his explanation of the fact that solid crystalline salts disassociate into paired charged particles when dissolved, for which he would win the 1903 Nobel Prize in Chemistry</span>

				<span class='text'>Faraday's belief had been that ions were produced in the process of [[electrolysis]]; Arrhenius proposed that, even in the absence of an electric current, solutions of salts contained ions</span>
				<span class='text'>He thus proposed that chemical reactions in solution were reactions between ions</span>

				<span class='text'>H</span>
				<span class='text'>van 't Hoff]]</span>
				<span class='text'>They were far more impressed, and Ostwald even came to Uppsala to persuade Arrhenius to join his research team</span>
				<span class='text'>Arrhenius declined, however, as he preferred to stay in Sweden for a while (his father was very ill and would die in 1885) and had received an appointment at Uppsala</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;columbia&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EncBrit&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SciBio&quot;/&gt;In an extension of his [[ion|ionic theory]] Arrhenius proposed definitions for [[acid]]s and [[Base (chemistry)|bases]], in 1884</span>
				<span class='text'>He believed that acids were substances that produce [[hydrogen]] [[ions]] in [[solution]] and that bases were substances that produce hydroxide ions in solution</span>
				<span class='text'>==Middle period===Arrhenius next received a travel grant from the Swedish Academy of Sciences, which enabled him to study with Ostwald in [[Riga]] (now in [[Latvia]]), with [[Friedrich Kohlrausch (physicist)|Friedrich Kohlrausch]] in [[Würzburg]], [[Germany]], with [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] in [[Graz, Austria]], and with van 't Hoff in [[Amsterdam]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1889 Arrhenius explained the fact that most reactions require added heat energy to proceed by formulating the concept of [[activation energy]], an energy barrier that must be overcome before two molecules will react</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Arrhenius equation]] gives the quantitative basis of the relationship between the activation energy and the rate at which a reaction proceeds</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1891 he became a lecturer at the Stockholm University College (''Stockholms Högskola'', now [[Stockholm University]]), being promoted to professor of physics (with much opposition) in 1895, and [[Rector (academia)|rector]] in 1896</span>
				<span class='text'>e was married twice, first to his former pupil Sofia Rudbeck (1894 to 1896), with whom he had one son [[w:fr:Olof Vilhelm Arrhenius]], and then to Maria Johansson (1905 to 1927), with whom he had two daughters and a son</span>
				<span class='text'>bout 1900, Arrhenius became involved in setting up the Nobel Institutes and the [[Nobel Prize]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>He was elected a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in 1901</span>
				<span class='text'>For the rest of his life, he would be a member of the [[Nobel Committee]] on Physics and a de facto member of the Nobel Committee on Chemistry</span>
				<span class='text'> He used his positions to arrange prizes for his friends ([[Jacobus van't Hoff]], [[Wilhelm Ostwald]], [[Theodore William Richards|Theodore Richards]]) and to attempt to deny them to his enemies ([[Paul Ehrlich]], [[Walther Nernst]], [[Dmitri Mendeleev]])</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1903 he became the first Swede to be awarded the [[Nobel Prize in chemistry]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1905, upon the founding of the Nobel Institute for Physical Research at Stockholm, he was appointed [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the institute, the position where he remained until retirement in 1927</span>

				<span class='text'>Arrhenius used the infrared observations of the moon by [[Frank Washington Very]] and [[Samuel Pierpont Langley]] at the [[Allegheny Observatory]] in Pittsburgh to calculate the absorption of infrared radiation by  atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and water vapour</span>
				<span class='text'>Using 'Stefan's law' (better known as the [[Stefan-Boltzmann law]]), he formulated his greenhouse law</span>
				<span class='text'>  In its original form, Arrhenius' greenhouse law reads as follows:::''if the quantity of carbonic acid [CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] increases in geometric progression, the augmentation of the temperature will increase nearly in arithmetic progression</span>

				<span class='text'>]Based on information from his colleague {{Ill|sv|Arvid Högbom}}, Arrhenius was the first person to predict that emissions of carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels and other combustion processes were large enough to cause global warming</span>
				<span class='text'>In his calculation Arrhenius included the feedback from changes in water vapor as well as latitudinal effects, but he omitted clouds, convection of heat upward in the atmosphere, and other essential factors</span>
				<span class='text'>His work is currently seen less as an accurate prediction of global warming than as the first demonstration that it should be taken as a serious possibility</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Svante Arrhenius (1909)]]Arrhenius' absorption values for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and his conclusions met criticism by [[Knut Ångström]] in 1900, who published the first modern infrared spectrum of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with two absorption bands, and published experimental results that seemed to show that absorption of infrared radiation by the gas in the atmosphere was already &quot;saturated&quot; so that adding more could make no difference</span>
				<span class='text'>Arrhenius replied strongly in 1901 (''Annalen der Physik''), dismissing the critique altogether</span>
				<span class='text'>He touched the subject briefly in a technical book titled ''Lehrbuch der kosmischen Physik'' (1903)</span>
				<span class='text'>He later wrote ''Världarnas utveckling'' (1906) (German: ''Das Werden der Welten'' [1907], English: [http://books</span>
				<span class='text'>oogle</span>
				<span class='text'>om/books?id=1t45AAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Worlds in the Making''] [1908]) directed at a general audience, where he suggested that the human emission of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; would be strong enough to prevent the world from entering a new ice age, and that a warmer earth would be needed to feed the rapidly increasing population:  :: &quot;To a certain extent the temperature of the earth's surface, as we shall presently see, is conditioned by the properties of the atmosphere surrounding it, and particularly by the permeability of the latter for the rays of heat</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; (p46):: &quot;That the atmospheric envelopes limit the heat losses from the planets had been suggested about 1800 by the great French physicist Fourier</span>
				<span class='text'>His ideas were further developed afterwards by Pouillet and Tyndall</span>
				<span class='text'>Their theory has been styled the hot-house theory, because they thought that the atmosphere acted after the manner of the glass panes of hot-houses</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; (p51):: &quot;If the quantity of carbonic acid [CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] in the air should sink to one-half its present percentage, the temperature would fall by about 4°; a diminution to one-quarter would reduce the temperature by 8°</span>
				<span class='text'>On the other hand, any doubling of the percentage of carbon dioxide in the air would raise the temperature of the earth's surface by 4°; and if the carbon dioxide were increased fourfold, the temperature would rise by 8°</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; (p53):: &quot;Although the sea, by absorbing carbonic acid, acts as a regulator of huge capacity, which takes up about five-sixths of the produced carbonic acid, we yet recognize that the slight percentage of carbonic acid in the atmosphere may by the advances of industry be changed to a noticeable degree in the course of a few centuries</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; (p54):: &quot;Since, now, warm ages have alternated with glacial periods, even after man appeared on the earth, we have to ask ourselves: Is it probable that we shall in the coming geological ages be visited by a new ice period that will drive us from our temperate countries into the hotter climates of Africa? There does not appear to be much ground for such an apprehension</span>
				<span class='text'>The enormous combustion of coal by our industrial establishments suffices to increase the percentage of carbon dioxide in the air to a perceptible degree</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; (p61):: &quot;We often hear lamentations that the coal stored up in the earth is wasted by the present generation without any thought of the future, and we are terrified by the awful destruction of life and property which has followed the volcanic eruptions of our days</span>
				<span class='text'>We may find a kind of consolation in the consideration that here, as in every other case, there is good mixed with the evil</span>
				<span class='text'>By the influence of the increasing percentage of carbonic acid in the atmosphere, we may hope to enjoy ages with more equable and better climates, especially as regards the colder regions of the earth, ages when the earth will bring forth much more abundant crops than at present, for the benefit of rapidly propagating mankind</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; (p63)Nowadays, the accepted explanation is that [[orbital forcing]] sets the timing for ice ages with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; acting as an essential [[positive feedback|amplifying feedback]]</span>
				<span class='text'>rrhenius estimated based on the CO2 levels at the time, that reducing levels by 0</span>
				<span class='text'>2 – 0</span>
				<span class='text'>5 would decrease temperatures by 4–5 °C (Celsius) and an increase of 2</span>
