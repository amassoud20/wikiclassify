				<span class='text'>Thus the one 2s and three 2p orbitals in a carbon atom can be combined to make four equivalent orbitals (called sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; hybrid orbitals), which would be the appropriate orbitals to describe carbon compounds such as [[methane]], or the 2s orbital may be combined with two of the 2p orbitals to make three equivalent orbitals (called sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; hybrid orbitals), with the remaining 2p orbital unhybridized, which would be the appropriate orbitals to describe certain [[alkene|unsaturated]] carbon compounds such as [[ethylene]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pauling Book&quot;/&gt;{{rp|111–120}} Other hybridization schemes are also found in other types of molecules</span>
				<span class='text'>nother area which he explored was the relationship between [[ionic bond]]ing, where electrons are transferred between atoms, and [[covalent bond]]ing, where electrons are shared between atoms on an equal basis</span>
				<span class='text'>Pauling showed that these were merely extremes, between which most actual cases of bonding fall</span>
				<span class='text'>It was here especially that Pauling's ''[[electronegativity]]'' concept was particularly useful; the electronegativity difference between a pair of atoms will be the surest predictor of the degree of ionicity of the bond</span>

				<span class='text'>Pauling showed that a proper description based on quantum mechanics was an intermediate structure which was a blend of each</span>
				<span class='text'>The structure was a superposition of structures rather than a rapid interconversion between them</span>

				<span class='text'>[[William Lawrence Bragg|Sir Lawrence Bragg]] had been disappointed that Pauling had won the race to find the alpha helix structure of proteins</span>
				<span class='text'>Bragg's team had made a fundamental error in making their models of protein by not recognizing the planar nature of the peptide bond</span>
				<span class='text'>When it was learned at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] that Pauling was working on molecular models of the structure of DNA, [[James Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]] were allowed to make a molecular model of DNA</span>
				<span class='text'>They later benefited from unpublished data from [[Maurice Wilkins]] and [[Rosalind Franklin]] at [[King's College London|King's College]] which showed evidence for a helix and planar base stacking along the helix axis</span>
				<span class='text'>Early in 1953 Watson and Crick proposed a correct structure for the DNA double helix</span>
				<span class='text'>Pauling later cited several reasons to explain how he had been misled about the structure of DNA, among them misleading density data and the lack of high quality X-ray diffraction photographs</span>
				<span class='text'>During the time Pauling was researching the problem, Rosalind Franklin in England was creating the world's best images</span>
				<span class='text'>They were key to Watson's and Crick's success</span>
				<span class='text'>Pauling did not see them before devising his mistaken DNA structure, although his assistant Robert Corey did see at least some of them, while taking Pauling's place at a summer 1952 protein conference in England</span>
				<span class='text'>Pauling had been prevented from attending because his passport was withheld by the State Department on suspicion that he had Communist sympathies</span>
				<span class='text'>This led to the legend that Pauling missed the structure of DNA because of the politics of the day (this was at the start of the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy]] period in the United States)</span>
				<span class='text'>Politics did not play a critical role</span>
				<span class='text'>Not only did Corey see the images at the time, but Pauling himself regained his passport within a few weeks and toured English laboratories well before writing his DNA paper</span>
				<span class='text'>He had ample opportunity to visit Franklin's lab and see her work, but chose not to</span>
