				<span class='text'>quot;His father, Sam Bernstein, was a businessman and owner of a hair product store in downtown Lawrence; it is standing today on the corners of Amesbury and Essex Streets</span>
				<span class='text'>Sam initially opposed young Leonard's interest in music</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite this, the elder Bernstein took him to orchestra concerts in his teenage years and eventually supported his music education</span>
				<span class='text'>At a very young age, Bernstein listened to a piano performance and was immediately captivated; he subsequently began learning the piano seriously when the family acquired his cousin Lillian Goldman's unwanted piano</span>
				<span class='text'>As a child, Bernstein attended the [[Garrison Grammar School]] and [[Boston Latin School]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Peyser (1987), p</span>
				<span class='text'>34</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; As a child he was very close to his younger sister Shirley, and would often play entire operas or Beethoven symphonies with her at the piano</span>
				<span class='text'>He had a variety of piano teachers in his youth, including Helen Coates, who later became his secretary</span>
				<span class='text'>fter graduation from [[Boston Latin School]] in 1935, Bernstein attended [[Harvard University]], where he studied music with, among others, [[Edward Burlingame Hill]] and [[Walter Piston]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he majored in music with a final year thesis (1939) entitled &quot;The Absorption of Race Elements into American Music&quot; (reproduced in his book ''Findings''), Bernstein's main intellectual influence at Harvard was probably the aesthetics Professor [[David Prall]], whose multidisciplinary outlook on the arts Bernstein shared for the rest of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>One of his friends at Harvard was philosopher [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]], with whom he played [[piano four hands]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Bernstein wrote and conducted the musical score for the production Davidson mounted of [[Aristophanes]]' play ''[[The Birds (play)|The Birds]]'' in the original Greek</span>
				<span class='text'>Bernstein reused some of this music in the ballet ''[[Fancy Free (ballet)|Fancy Free]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>During his time at Harvard he was briefly an accompanist for the [[Harvard Glee Club]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Peyser (1987), p</span>
				<span class='text'>39–40</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Bernstein also mounted a student production of ''[[The Cradle Will Rock]]'', directing its action from the piano as the composer [[Marc Blitzstein]] had done at the premiere</span>
				<span class='text'>Blitzstein, who heard about the production, subsequently became a friend and influence (both musically and politically) on Bernstein</span>
				<span class='text'>ernstein also met the conductor [[Dimitri Mitropoulos]] at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he never taught Bernstein, Mitropoulos's charisma and power as a musician was a major influence on Bernstein's eventual decision to take up conducting</span>
				<span class='text'>Mitropoulos was not stylistically that similar to Bernstein, but he probably influenced some of Bernstein's later habits such as his conducting from the keyboard, his initial practice of conducting without a baton and perhaps his interest in Mahler</span>
				<span class='text'>The other important influence that Bernstein first met during his Harvard years was composer [[Aaron Copland]], whom he met at a concert and then at a party afterwards on Copland's birthday in 1938</span>
				<span class='text'>At the party Bernstein played Copland's ''Piano Variations'', a thorny work Bernstein loved without knowing anything about its composer until that evening</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he was not formally Copland's student as such, Bernstein would regularly seek advice from Copland in the following years about his own compositions and would often cite him as &quot;his only real composition teacher&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=teachers&gt;See for instance Bernstein's 1980 TV Documentary, ''Teachers and Teaching'' available on a Deutsche Grammophon DVD</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;After completing his studies at Harvard in 1939 (graduating with a B</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>''cum laude''), he enrolled at the [[Curtis Institute of Music]] in [[Philadelphia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>During his time at Curtis, Bernstein studied conducting with [[Fritz Reiner]] (who anecdotally is said to have given Bernstein the only &quot;A grade&quot; he ever awarded), piano with [[Isabelle Vengerova]],&lt;ref&gt;Peyser (1987) (Bernstein complained later that she taught him an incorrect piano technique), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>38–9</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; orchestration with [[Randall Thompson]], counterpoint with [[Richard Stöhr]], and score reading with Renée Longy Miquelle</span>

				<span class='text'>He took jobs with a music publisher, transcribing music or producing arrangements under the pseudonym Lenny Amber</span>

				<span class='text'>ernstein's friendships with Copland (who was very close to Koussevitsky) and Mitropoulos were important in him being recommended for a place in the class</span>
				<span class='text'>Other students in the class included [[Lukas Foss]], who also became a lifelong friend</span>
				<span class='text'>Koussevitsky perhaps did not teach Bernstein much basic conducting technique (which he had already developed under Reiner) but instead became a sort of father figure to him and was perhaps the major influence on Bernstein's emotional way of interpreting music</span>

				<span class='text'>The &quot;event&quot; was due in part to the efforts of [[Dorle Soria]] who had been on the staff of the New York Philharmonic since the late 1920s</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He became instantly famous because the concert was nationally broadcast, and afterwards started to appear as a guest conductor with many U</span>

				<span class='text'>Before the concert Bernstein briefly spoke to Bruno Walter, who discussed particular difficulties in the works he was to perform</span>

				<span class='text'>lso in regard to a different audience, in 1945 Bernstein discussed the possibility of acting in a film with [[Greta Garbo]]—playing [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] opposite her starring role as the composer's patron [[Nadezhda von Meck]]</span>

				<span class='text'>In January 1944 he conducted the premiere of his ''[[Symphony No</span>

				<span class='text'>His score to the ballet ''[[Fancy Free (ballet)|Fancy Free]]'' choreographed by [[Jerome Robbins]] opened in New York in April 1944 and this was later developed into the musical ''[[On the Town (musical)|On the Town]]'' with lyrics by Comden and Green that opened on Broadway in December 1944</span>
				<span class='text'>fter World War II, Bernstein's career on the international stage began to flourish</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1946, he made his his overseas debut with the [[Czech Philharmonic]] in Prague</span>
				<span class='text'>He also recorded Ravel's ''[[Piano Concerto (Ravel)|Piano Concerto in G]]'' as soloist and conductor with the [[Philharmonia Orchestra]]</span>
				<span class='text'>On July 4, 1946, Bernstein conducted the European premiere of ''[[Fancy Free (ballet)|Fancy Free]]'' with the Ballet Theatre at the Royal Opera House in London</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1946, he conducted opera for the first time, with the American première at Tanglewood of [[Benjamin Britten]]'s ''[[Peter Grimes]]'', which had been a Koussevitzky commission</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1957, he conducted the inaugural concert of the [[Mann Auditorium]] in Tel Aviv; he subsequently made many recordings there</span>

				<span class='text'>2]] of [[Charles Ives]], which was written around half a century earlier but had never been performed</span>
				<span class='text'>Throughout his career, Bernstein often talked about the music of Ives, who died in 1954</span>
				<span class='text'>The composer, old and frail, was unable (some reports say unwilling) to attend the concert, but his wife did</span>
				<span class='text'>He reportedly listened to a radio broadcast of it on a radio in his kitchen some days later</span>
				<span class='text'>A recording of the &quot;premiere&quot; was released in a 10-CD box set ''Bernstein LIVE'' by the orchestra, but the notes indicate it was a repeat performance from three days later, and this is perhaps what Ives heard</span>
				<span class='text'>In any case, reports also differ on Ives's exact reaction, but some suggest he was thrilled and danced a little jig</span>
				<span class='text'>Bernstein recorded the 2nd symphony with the orchestra in 1958 for Columbia and 1987 for Deutsche Grammophon</span>

				<span class='text'>The festival was named after him in 2005, becoming the Leonard Bernstein Festival of the Creative Arts</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1953 he was the first American conductor to appear at [[La Scala]] in Milan, conducting [[Maria Callas]] in Cherubini's ''Medea''</span>
				<span class='text'>This Opera had been virtually abandoned in the performance archive and the two of them learnt in a week</span>
				<span class='text'>It was to prove a unique collaboration and Callas and Bernstein went on to perform together many times - he found her vocal reach and dramatic powers of interpretation inspiring; they developed a very close musical relationship which enhanced both their careers</span>

				<span class='text'>The live lecture, entitled &quot;Beethoven's Fifth Symphony&quot;, involved Bernstein explaining the work with the aid of musicians from the former [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]] (recently renamed the &quot;Symphony of the Air&quot;) and a giant page of the score covering the floor</span>
				<span class='text'>Bernstein subsequently performed concerts with the orchestra and recorded his Serenade for Violin with [[Isaac Stern]]</span>

				<span class='text'>n late 1956, Bernstein conducted the New York Philharmonic in concerts that were to have been conducted by [[Guido Cantelli]], who had died in an air crash in Paris</span>
				<span class='text'>This was the first time Bernstein had conducted the orchestra in subscription concerts since 1951</span>
				<span class='text'>Partly due to these appearances, Bernstein was named the music director of the New York Philharmonic in 1957, replacing [[Dimitri Mitropoulos]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He began his tenure in that position in 1958, having held the post jointly with Mitropoulos from 1957 to 1958</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1958, Bernstein and Mitropoulos took the New York Philharmonic on tour to South America</span>
				<span class='text'>In his first season in sole charge, Bernstein included a season-long survey of American classical music</span>
				<span class='text'>Themed programming of this sort was fairly novel at that time compared to the present day</span>
				<span class='text'>Bernstein held the music directorship until 1969 (with a sabbatical in 1965) although he continued to conduct and make recordings with the orchestra for the rest of his life and was appointed &quot;laureate conductor&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>His first Young People's Concert was televised a few weeks after his tenure began as principal conductor of the New York Philharmonic</span>
				<span class='text'>He became as famous for his educational work in those concerts as for his conducting</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Bernstein at the piano, making annotations to a musical score]]Around the time he was appointed music director of the New York Philharmonic, Bernstein composed the music for two shows</span>
				<span class='text'>The first was for the operetta ''[[Candide (operetta)|Candide]]'', which was first performed in 1956 with a libretto by [[Lillian Hellman]] based on Voltaire's novel</span>
				<span class='text'>The second was Bernstein's collaboration with the choreographer [[Jerome Robbins]], the writer [[Arthur Laurents]], and the lyricist [[Stephen Sondheim]] to produce the musical ''[[West Side Story]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The first three had worked on it intermittently since Robbins first suggested the idea in 1949</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally, with the addition of Sondheim to the team and a period of concentrated effort, it received its Broadway premiere in 1957 and has since proven to be Bernstein's most popular and enduring score</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1959, he took the New York Philharmonic on a tour of Europe and the Soviet Union, portions of which were filmed by [[CBS Television]]</span>
				<span class='text'>A highlight of the tour was Bernstein's performance of [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]'s [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>5 (Shostakovich)|Fifth Symphony]], in the presence of the composer, who came on stage at the end to congratulate Bernstein and the musicians</span>
				<span class='text'>In October, when Bernstein and the orchestra returned to the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> they recorded the symphony for Columbia</span>
				<span class='text'>He recorded it for a second time with the orchestra on tour in Japan in 1979</span>
				<span class='text'>Bernstein seems to have limited himself to only conducting certain Shostakovich symphonies, namely the numbers 1, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 14</span>
				<span class='text'>He made two recordings of Shostakovich's ''[[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>7 (Shostakovich)|Leningrad Symphony]]'', one with the New York Philharmonic in the 1960s and another recorded live in 1988 with the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]] (one of the few recordings he made with them, also including the [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>1 (Shostakovich)|Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>1]])</span>
				<span class='text'>==1960–1969===In 1960 Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic held a Mahler Festival to mark the centenary of the composer's birth</span>
				<span class='text'>Bernstein, Walter and Mitropoulos conducted performances</span>
				<span class='text'>The composer's widow, [[Alma Mahler-Werfel|Alma]], attended some of Bernstein's rehearsals</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1960 Bernstein also made his first commercial recording of a [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>4 (Mahler)|Mahler symphony (the fourth)]] and over the next seven years he made the first complete cycle of recordings of all nine of Mahler's completed symphonies</span>
				<span class='text'>(All featured the New York Philharmonic except the 8th Symphony which was recorded with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] following a concert in the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London in 1966</span>
				<span class='text'> The success of these recordings, along with Bernstein's concert performances and television talks, was an important, if not vital, part of the revival of interest in Mahler in the 1960s, especially in the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>ther non-U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>composers that Bernstein championed to some extent at the time include the Danish composer [[Carl Nielsen]] (who was then only little known in the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> and [[Jean Sibelius]], whose popularity had by then started to fade</span>
				<span class='text'>Bernstein eventually recorded a complete cycle in New York of Sibelius's symphonies and three of Nielsen's symphonies (Nos</span>
				<span class='text'>2, 4, and 5), as well as conducting recordings of his violin, clarinet and flute concertos</span>
				<span class='text'>He also recorded Nielsen's 3rd Symphony with the [[Royal Danish Orchestra]] after a critically acclaimed public performance in Denmark</span>
				<span class='text'>Bernstein championed U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>composers, especially those that he was close to like [[Aaron Copland]], [[William Schuman]] and [[David Diamond (composer)|David Diamond]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also started to more extensively record his own compositions for Columbia Records</span>
				<span class='text'>This included his three symphonies, his ballets, and the ''Symphonic Dances'' from ''West Side Story'' with the New York Philharmonic</span>
				<span class='text'>He also conducted an LP of his 1944 musical ''[[On the Town (musical)|On The Town]]'', the first (almost) complete recording of the original featuring several members of the original Broadway cast, including [[Betty Comden]] and [[Adolph Green]]</span>
				<span class='text'>(The 1949 film version only contains four of Bernstein's original numbers</span>
				<span class='text'> Bernstein also collaborated with the experimental jazz pianist and composer [[Dave Brubeck]] resulting in the recording &quot;Bernstein Plays Brubeck Plays Bernstein&quot; (1961)</span>
				<span class='text'>n one oft-reported incident, in April 1962 Bernstein appeared on stage before a performance of the [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] [[Piano Concerto No</span>
				<span class='text'>1 (Brahms)|Piano Concerto No</span>
				<span class='text'>1 in D minor]] with the pianist [[Glenn Gould]]</span>
				<span class='text'>During rehearsals, Gould had argued for tempi much broader than normal, which did not reflect Bernstein's concept of the music</span>
				<span class='text'>Bernstein gave a brief address to the audience starting with &quot;Don't be frightened; Mr Gould is here</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot; and going on to &quot;In a concerto, who is the boss (audience laughter)—the soloist or the conductor?&quot; (Audience laughter grows louder)</span>
				<span class='text'>The answer is, of course, sometimes the one and sometimes the other, depending on the people involved</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This speech was subsequently interpreted by [[Harold C</span>
				<span class='text'>Schonberg]], music critic for ''The New York Times'', as abdication of personal responsibility and an attack on Gould, whose performance Schonberg went on to criticize heavily</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>that won't go away&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;!--inline citation ho!--&gt; Throughout his life, he professed admiration and friendship for Gould</span>
				<span class='text'>Schonberg was often (though not always) harshly critical of Bernstein as a conductor during his tenure as Music Director</span>
				<span class='text'>However, his views were not shared by the audiences (with many full houses) and probably not by the musicians themselves (who had greater financial security arising from Bernstein's many TV and recording activities amongst other things)</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1962 the New York Philharmonic moved from [[Carnegie Hall]] to Philharmonic Hall (now [[David Geffen Hall]]) in the new [[Lincoln Center]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The move was not without controversy because of acoustic problems with the new hall</span>
				<span class='text'>Bernstein conducted the gala opening concert featuring vocal works by Mahler, Beethoven and Vaughan Williams, and the premiere of Aaron Copland's ''[[Connotations For Orchestra|Connotations]]'', a serial-work that was merely politely received</span>
				<span class='text'>During the intermission Bernstein kissed the cheek of the President's wife [[Jacqueline Kennedy]], a break with protocol that was commented on at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1961 Bernstein had conducted at President [[John F</span>
				<span class='text'>Kennedy]]'s pre-inaugural gala, and he was an occasional guest in the Kennedy White House</span>
				<span class='text'>He also conducted at the funeral mass in 1968 for the late President Kennedy's brother [[Robert Kennedy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1964 Bernstein conducted [[Franco Zeffirelli]]'s production of [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]'' at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1966 he made his debut at the [[Vienna State Opera]] conducting [[Luchino Visconti]]'s production of the same opera with [[Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau]] as Falstaff</span>
				<span class='text'>During his time in Vienna he also recorded the opera for Columbia Records and conducted his first subscription concert with the [[Vienna Philharmonic]] (which is made up of players from the Vienna State Opera) featuring Mahler's ''[[Das Lied von der Erde]]'' with Fischer-Dieskau and [[James King (tenor)|James King]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He returned to the State Opera in 1968 for a production of ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'' and in 1970 for [[Otto Schenk]]'s production of Beethoven's ''[[Fidelio]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Sixteen years later, at the State Opera, Bernstein conducted his sequel to ''Trouble in Tahiti'', ''A Quiet Place</span>
				<span class='text'>' with the [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]] orchestra</span>
				<span class='text'>Bernstein's final farewell to the State Opera happened accidentally in 1989: following a performance of [[Modest Mussorgsky]]'s ''[[Khovanshchina]]'', he unexpectedly entered the stage and embraced conductor [[Claudio Abbado]] in front of a cheering audience</span>
				<span class='text'>ith his commitment to the New York Philharmonic and his many other activities, Bernstein had little time for composition during the 1960s</span>
				<span class='text'>The two major works he produced at this time were his ''[[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>3 (Bernstein)|Kaddish Symphony]]'' dedicated to the recently assassinated President [[John F</span>
				<span class='text'>Kennedy]] and the ''[[Chichester Psalms]]'' which he produced during a sabbatical year he took from the Philharmonic in 1965 to concentrate on composition</span>
				<span class='text'>To try to have more time for composition was probably a major factor in his decision to step down as Music Director of the Philharmonic in 1969, and to never accept such a position anywhere again</span>

				<span class='text'>He also strengthened his relationship with the [[Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra]]&amp;nbsp;– he conducted all nine completed Mahler symphonies with them (plus the adagio from the 10th) in the period from 1967 to 1976</span>
				<span class='text'>All of these were filmed for Unitel with the exception of the 1967 Mahler 2nd, which instead Bernstein filmed with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] in [[Ely Cathedral]] in 1973</span>
				<span class='text'>In the late 1970s Bernstein conducted a complete Beethoven symphony cycle with the Vienna Philharmonic, and cycles of Brahms and Schumann were to follow in the 1980s</span>

				<span class='text'>It was originally a target of criticism from the Roman Catholic Church on the one hand and contemporary music critics who objected to its Broadway/populist elements on the other</span>

				<span class='text'>The invitation for the concerts had come from the orchestra and not from its principal conductor [[Herbert von Karajan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>There has been speculation about why Karajan never invited Bernstein to conduct his orchestra</span>
				<span class='text'>(Karajan did conduct the New York Philharmonic during Bernstein's tenure</span>

				<span class='text'>For the rest of the 1980s he continued to conduct, teach, compose, and produce the occasional TV documentary</span>
				<span class='text'>His most significant compositions of the decade were probably his opera ''[[A Quiet Place]]'', which he wrote with [[Stephen Wadsworth]] and which premiered (in its original version) in Houston in 1983; his ''Divertimento for Orchestra''; his ''[[Halil (Bernstein)|Halil]]'' for flute and orchestra; his ''Concerto for Orchestra &quot;Jubilee Games&quot;''; and his song cycle ''Arias and Barcarolles'', which was named after a comment President [[Dwight D</span>

				<span class='text'>In addition to conducting in New York, Vienna and Israel, Bernstein was a regular guest conductor of other orchestras in the 1980s</span>
				<span class='text'>These included the [[Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra]] in Amsterdam, with whom he recorded Mahler's First, Fourth, and Ninth Symphonies amongst other works; the [[Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra]] in Munich, with whom he recorded Wagner's ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]''; Haydn's ''[[The Creation (Haydn)|Creation]]''; Mozart's ''[[Requiem (Mozart)|Requiem]]'' and ''[[Great Mass in C minor]]''; and the orchestra of [[Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia]] in Rome, with whom he recorded some Debussy and Puccini's ''[[La bohème]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1982, he and [[Ernest Fleischmann]] founded the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic Institute]] as a summer training academy along the lines of Tanglewood</span>
				<span class='text'>Bernstein served as artistic director and taught conducting there until 1984</span>
				<span class='text'>Around the same time, he performed and recorded some of his own works with the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]] for Deutsche Grammophon</span>
				<span class='text'>Bernstein was also at the time a committed supporter of nuclear disarmament</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1985 he took the [[European Union Youth Orchestra|European Community Youth Orchestra]] in a &quot;Journey for Peace&quot; tour around Europe and to Japan</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1985, he conducted a recording of ''[[West Side Story]]'', the first time he had conducted the entire work</span>
				<span class='text'>The recording, featuring what some critics felt were miscast opera singers such as [[Kiri Te Kanawa]], [[José Carreras]], and [[Tatiana Troyanos]] in the leading roles, was nevertheless an international bestseller</span>
				<span class='text'>A TV documentary showing the making of the recording was made at the same time and is available on DVD</span>
				<span class='text'>Bernstein also continued to make his own TV documentaries during the 1980s, including ''The Little Drummer Boy'', in which he discussed the music of Gustav Mahler, perhaps the composer he was most passionately interested in, and ''The Love of Three Orchestras'', in which he discussed his work in New York, Vienna, and Israel</span>
				<span class='text'>n his later years, Bernstein's life and work was celebrated around the world (as it has been since his death)</span>
				<span class='text'>The Israel Philharmonic celebrated his involvement with them at Festivals in Israel and Austria in 1977</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1986 the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] mounted a Bernstein Festival in London with one concert that Bernstein himself conducted attended by the [[Elizabeth II|Queen]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1988 Bernstein's 70th birthday was celebrated by a lavish televised gala at Tanglewood featuring many performers who had worked with him over the years</span>
				<span class='text'>n December 1989, Bernstein conducted live performances and recorded in the studio his operetta ''[[Candide]]'' with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The recording starred [[Jerry Hadley]], [[June Anderson]], [[Adolph Green]], and [[Christa Ludwig]] in the leading roles</span>
				<span class='text'>The use of opera singers in some roles perhaps fitted the style of [[operetta]] better than some critics had thought was the case for ''West Side Story'', and the recording (released posthumously in 1991) was universally praised</span>
				<span class='text'>One of the live concerts from the [[Barbican Centre]] in London is available on DVD</span>
				<span class='text'>''Candide'' had had a troubled history, with many rewrites and writers involved</span>
				<span class='text'>Bernstein's concert and recording were based on a &quot;final&quot; version that had been first performed by [[Scottish Opera]] in 1988</span>

				<span class='text'>Bernstein added, &quot;I'm sure that Beethoven would have given us his blessing</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|210px|thumb|left|Leonard Bernstein in 1971]]{{refimprove section|date=December 2012}}Bernstein was one of the major figures in orchestral conducting in the second half of the 20th century</span>
				<span class='text'>He was held in high regard amongst many musicians, including the members of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, evidenced by his honorary membership; the [[London Symphony Orchestra]], of which he was President; and the [[Israel Philharmonic Orchestra]], with which he appeared regularly as guest conductor</span>
				<span class='text'>He was probably the main conductor from the 1960s onwards who acquired a sort of superstar status similar to that of [[Herbert von Karajan]], although unlike Karajan he conducted relatively little opera and part of Bernstein's fame was based on his role as a composer</span>
				<span class='text'>As the first American-born music director of the New York Philharmonic, his rise to prominence was a factor in overcoming the perception of the time that the top conductors were necessarily trained in Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>ernstein's conducting was characterized by extremes of emotion with the rhythmic pulse of the music conveyed visually through his balletic podium manner</span>
				<span class='text'>Musicians often reported that his manner in rehearsal was the same as in concert</span>
				<span class='text'>As he got older his performances tended to be overlaid to a greater extent with a personal expressiveness which often divided critical opinion</span>
				<span class='text'>Extreme examples of this style can be found in his Deutsche Grammophon recordings of Nimrod from Elgar's ''Enigma Variations'' (1982), the end of Mahler's 9th Symphony (1985), and the finale of Tchaikovsky's ''Pathetique Symphony'' (1986), where in each case the tempos are well below those typically chosen</span>
				<span class='text'>ernstein performed a wide repertoire from the baroque era to the 20th century, although perhaps from the 1970s onwards he tended to focus more on music from the romantic era</span>
				<span class='text'>He was considered especially accomplished with the works of [[Gustav Mahler]] and with American composers in general, including [[George Gershwin]], [[Aaron Copland]], [[Charles Ives]], [[Roy Harris]], [[William Schuman]], and of course himself</span>
				<span class='text'>Some of his recordings of works by these composers would likely appear on many music critics' lists of recommended recordings</span>
				<span class='text'>A list of his other well-thought-of recordings would probably include individual works from [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]], [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]], [[Carl Nielsen|Nielsen]], [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]], [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]], [[Paul Hindemith|Hindemith]], and [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]], among others</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Holmes | first=John L</span>
				<span class='text'>title=Conductors on Record | location= UK | publisher=Greenwood Press | year=1982 | isbn=0-313-22990-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; His recordings of ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'' (full-orchestra version) and ''[[An American in Paris]]'' for Columbia Records, released in 1959, are considered definitive by many, although Bernstein cut the ''Rhapsody'' slightly, and his more 'symphonic' approach with slower tempi is quite far from Gershwin's own conception of the piece, evident from his two recordings</span>
				<span class='text'>([[Oscar Levant]], [[Earl Wild]], and others come closer to Gershwin's own style</span>
				<span class='text'> Bernstein never conducted Gershwin's [[Concerto in F (Gershwin)|Piano Concerto in F]], or more than a few excerpts from ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'', although he did discuss the latter in his article ''Why Don't You Run Upstairs and Write a Nice Gershwin Tune?'', originally published in ''The New York Times'' and later reprinted in his 1959 book ''The Joy of Music</span>
				<span class='text'>'In addition to being an active conductor, Bernstein was a very influential teacher of conducting</span>
				<span class='text'>During his many years of teaching at Tanglewood and elsewhere, he directly taught or mentored many conductors who are performing now, such as [[John Mauceri]], [[Marin Alsop]], [[Herbert Blomstedt]], [[Edo de Waart]], [[Alexander Frey]], [[Paavo Järvi]], [[Eiji Oue]], [[Maurice Peress]], [[Seiji Ozawa]] (who made his American TV debut as the guest conductor on one of the ''Young People's Concerts''), [[Carl St</span>
				<span class='text'>lair]], [[Helmuth Rilling]], [[Michael Tilson Thomas]], and [[Jaap van Zweden]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also undoubtedly influenced the career choices of many American musicians who grew up watching his television programmes in the 1950s and 60s</span>
				<span class='text'>=Recordings==Bernstein recorded extensively from the mid-1940s until just a few months before his death</span>
				<span class='text'>Aside from those 1940s' recordings, which were made for [[RCA Victor]], Bernstein recorded primarily for [[Columbia Masterworks Records]], especially when he was music director of the New York Philharmonic between 1958 and 1971</span>
				<span class='text'>His typical pattern of recording at that time was to record major works in the studio immediately after they were presented in the orchestra's subscription concerts or on one of the ''Young People's Concerts'', with any spare time used to record short orchestral showpieces and similar works</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of these performances were digitally remastered and reissued by [[Sony]] as part of their 100 Volume, 125 CDs &quot;Royal Edition&quot; and their later &quot;Bernstein Century&quot; series</span>

				<span class='text'>Unlike his studio recordings for Columbia Masterworks, most of his later Deutsche Grammophon recordings were taken from live concerts (or edited together from several concerts with additional sessions to correct errors)</span>

				<span class='text'>n addition to his audio recordings, many of Bernstein's concerts from the 1970s onwards were recorded on motion picture film by the German film company Unitel</span>
				<span class='text'>This included a complete cycle of the Mahler symphonies (with the Vienna Philharmonic and London Symphony Orchestra), as well as complete cycles of the Beethoven, Brahms and Schumann symphonies recorded at the same series of concerts as the audio recordings by Deutsche Grammophon</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of these films appeared on [[Laserdisc]] and are now on DVD</span>
				<span class='text'>n total Bernstein was awarded 16 [[Grammys]] for his recordings in various categories, including several for posthumously released recordings</span>
				<span class='text'>He was also awarded a Lifetime Achievement Grammy in 1985</span>
				<span class='text'>=Influence and characteristics as a composer==Bernstein was an eclectic composer whose music fused elements of jazz, Jewish music, theatre music and the work of earlier composers like [[Aaron Copland]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Darius Milhaud]], [[George Gershwin]], and [[Marc Blitzstein]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Some of his works, especially his score for ''[[West Side Story]]'', helped bridge the gap between classical and popular music</span>
				<span class='text'>His music was rooted in tonality but in some works like his ''[[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>3 (Bernstein)|Kaddish Symphony]]'' and the opera ''[[A Quiet Place]]'' he mixed in 12-tone elements</span>
				<span class='text'>Bernstein himself said his main motivation for composing was &quot;to communicate&quot; and that all his pieces, including his symphonies and concert works, &quot;could in some sense be thought of as 'theatre' pieces</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=reflections&gt;In the 1978 Peter Rosen documentary ''Leonard Bernstein: Reflections'', now available on a Medici Arts DVD</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; According to the League of American orchestras,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>df|title=2008-2009 Season, Orchestra Repertoire Report|publisher=League of American Orchestras|accessdate=January 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was the second most frequently performed American composer by U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>orchestras in 2008-9 behind Copland, and he was the 16th most frequently performed composer overall by U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>orchestras</span>
				<span class='text'>(Some performances were probably due to the 90th anniversary of his birth in 2008</span>
				<span class='text'> His most popular pieces were the ''Overture to Candide'', the ''Symphonic Dances from West Side Story'', the ''[[Serenade after Plato's &quot;Symposium&quot;|Serenade for Violin, Strings, Harp and Percussion]]'' and the ''Three Dance Episodes from On the Town''</span>
				<span class='text'>His shows ''[[West Side Story]]'', ''[[On the Town (musical)|On the Town]]'', ''[[Wonderful Town]]'' and ''[[Candide (operetta)|Candide]]'' are regularly performed, and his symphonies and concert works are programmed from time to time by orchestras around the world</span>
				<span class='text'>Since his death many of his works have been commercially recorded by artists other than himself</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''[[Serenade after Plato's &quot;Symposium&quot;|Serenade]]'', which has been recorded more than 10 times, is probably his most recorded work not taken from an actual theatre piece</span>
				<span class='text'>espite the fact that he was a popular success as a composer, Bernstein himself is reported to have been disillusioned that some of his more serious works were not rated more highly by critics, and that he himself had not been able to devote more time to composing because of his conducting and other activities</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=reaching/&gt; Professional criticism of Bernstein's music often involves discussing the degree to which he created something new as art versus simply skillfully borrowing and fusing together elements from others</span>
				<span class='text'>In the late 1960s, Bernstein himself reflected that his [[eclecticism]] was in part due to his lack of lengthy periods devoted to composition, and that he was still seeking to enrich his own personal musical language in the manner of the great composers of the past, all of whom had borrowed elements from others</span>

				<span class='text'>'The Private World of Leonard Bernstein</span>
				<span class='text'>' New York: The Viking Press</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the harshest criticism he received from some critics in his lifetime though was directed at works like his ''Kaddish Symphony'', his ''MASS'' and the opera ''A Quiet Place'', where they found the underlying message of the piece or the text as either mildly embarrassing, clichéd or offensive</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite this, all these pieces have been performed, discussed and reconsidered since his death</span>
				<span class='text'>ernstein's works were performed several times for [[Pope John Paul II]], including at [[World Youth Day]] in [[Denver]] on August&amp;nbsp;14, 1993 (excerpts from &quot;MASS&quot;), and at the [[Papal Concert to Commemorate the Shoah]] on April 7, 1994, with the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]] (&quot;Chichester Psalms&quot; and Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>3, &quot;Kaddish&quot; [excerpt]) in the Sala Nervi at the Vatican</span>
				<span class='text'>Both performances were conducted by [[Gilbert Levine]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough he taught conducting, Bernstein was not a teacher of composition as such, and he has no direct composing heirs</span>
				<span class='text'>Perhaps the closest are composers like [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]], who from the 1970s onwards indirectly adopted elements of his eclectic, theatrical style</span>
