				<span class='text'>He was born in Rome—in either 1475 or 1476—the illegitimate son of Cardinal Roderic Llançol i de Borja, (usually known as [[Rodrigo Borgia]]), later [[Pope Alexander VI]], and his mistress [[Vannozza dei Cattanei]], about whom information is sparse</span>
				<span class='text'>The Borgia family originally came from the [[Kingdom of Valencia]], and rose to prominence during the mid-15th century; Cesare's grand-uncle Alphonso Borgia (1378–1458), bishop of Valencia, was elected [[Pope Callixtus III]] in 1455</span>

				<span class='text'>{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cesare's father, Pope Alexander VI, was the first pope who openly recognized his children born out of wedlock</span>
				<span class='text'>[Stefano Infessura]] writes that Cardinal Borgia falsely claimed Cesare to be the legitimate son of another man—Domenico d'Arignano, the nominal husband of Vannozza dei Cattanei</span>
				<span class='text'>More likely, [[Pope Sixtus IV]] granted Cesare a release from the necessity of proving his birth in a [[papal bull]] of 1 October 1480</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Sabatini (pp</span>
				<span class='text'>45, 48), citing the supplement to the Appendix of Thuasne's edition of Burchard's ''Diarium''&lt;/ref&gt;==Career=====Church office===Cesare was initially groomed for a career in the [[Catholic Church|Church]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was made Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Pamplona y Tudela|Pamplona]] at the age of 15</span>
				<span class='text'>Following school in [[Perugia]] and [[Pisa]], Cesare studied law at the ''Studium Urbis'' (nowadays [[Sapienza University of Rome]]), along with his father's elevation to Pope, Cesare was made [[Catholic Cardinal|Cardinal]] at the age of 18</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;xvfywc&quot; /&gt;Alexander VI staked the hopes of the Borgia family on Cesare's brother [[Giovanni Borgia, 2nd Duke of Gandia|Giovanni]], who was made captain general of the military forces of the papacy</span>
				<span class='text'>Giovanni was assassinated in 1497 in mysterious circumstances</span>
				<span class='text'>Several contemporaries suggested that Cesare might have been his killer,&lt;ref&gt;Spinosa, ''La saga dei Borgia''&lt;/ref&gt; as Giovanni's disappearance could finally open to him a long-awaited military career and also solve the jealousy over [[Sancha of Aragon]], wife of Cesare's younger brother, [[Gioffre Borgia|Gioffre]], and mistress of both Cesare and Giovanni</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Rendina, ''I capitani di ventura''&lt;/ref&gt; Cesare's role in the act has never been clear</span>
				<span class='text'>However, he had no definitive motive, as he was likely to be given a powerful secular position, whether or not his brother lived</span>
				<span class='text'>It is more likely, in fact, that Giovanni was killed as a result of a sexual liaison</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Michael de la Bedoyere, ''The Meddlesome Friar and the Wayward Pope'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>20, Quote: &quot;Next morning the absence of the Duke was noticed by his servants, and the Pontiff was informed</span>
				<span class='text'>He was not too worried for, as Burchard says, Alexander jumped to the conclusion that his son had spent the night with some girl and preferred to avoid the indiscretion of leaving by day</span>
				<span class='text'>It may be mentioned in passing that this touch, as with many others one comes across, hardly squares with the general view that the Pope, his family and those around him were without shame</span>
				<span class='text'>Juan was a dissolute young man and not a churchman, yet Alexander presumed on a discretion more in keeping with later times</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt;On 17 August 1498, Cesare became the first person in history to resign the cardinalate</span>

				<span class='text'>==Military==={{Refimprove section|date=March 2012}}Cesare's career was founded upon his father's ability to distribute patronage, along with his alliance with France (reinforced by his marriage with [[Charlotte d'Albret]], sister of [[John III of Navarre]]), in the course of the [[Italian Wars]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis XII invaded Italy in 1499: after [[Gian Giacomo Trivulzio]] had ousted its duke [[Ludovico Sforza]], Cesare accompanied the king in his entrance into [[Milan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Cesare Borgia, Duke of Valentinois</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Profile portrait of Cesare Borgia in the Palazzo Venezia in Rome, ca</span>
				<span class='text'>1500–10]]At this point Alexander decided to profit from the favourable situation and carve out for Cesare a state of his own in northern Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>To this end, he declared that all his vicars in [[Romagna]] and [[Marche]] were deposed</span>
				<span class='text'>Though in theory subject directly to the pope, these rulers had been practically independent or dependent on other states for generations</span>
				<span class='text'>In the view of the citizens, these vicars were cruel and petty</span>
				<span class='text'>When Cesare eventually took power, he was viewed by the citizens as a great improvement</span>
				<span class='text'>esare was appointed commander of the papal armies with a number of Italian mercenaries, supported by 300 cavalry and 4,000 Swiss infantry sent by the King of France</span>
				<span class='text'>Alexander sent him to capture [[Imola]] and [[Forlì]], ruled by [[Caterina Sforza]] (mother of the Medici ''condottiero'' [[Giovanni dalle Bande Nere]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite being deprived of his French troops after the conquest of those two cities, Borgia returned to Rome to celebrate a triumph and to receive the title of [[Gonfalonier of the Church|Papal Gonfalonier]] from his father</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1500 the creation of twelve new cardinals granted Alexander enough money for Cesare to hire the ''condottieri,'' [[Vitellozzo Vitelli]], [[Gian Paolo Baglioni]], [[Giulio Orsini|Giulio]] and [[Paolo Orsini]], and [[Oliverotto|Oliverotto da Fermo]], who resumed his campaign in Romagna</span>
				<span class='text'>[Giovanni Sforza]], first husband of Cesare's sister Lucrezia, was soon ousted from [[Pesaro]]; [[Pandolfo IV Malatesta|Pandolfo Malatesta]] lost [[Rimini]]; [[Faenza]] surrendered, its young lord [[Astorre III Manfredi]] being later drowned in the Tiber river by Cesare's order</span>
				<span class='text'>In May 1501 the latter was created duke of Romagna</span>
				<span class='text'>Hired by Florence, Cesare subsequently added the lordship of [[Piombino]] to his new lands</span>
				<span class='text'>hile his ''condottieri'' took over the siege of Piombino (which ended in 1502), Cesare commanded the French troops in the sieges of Naples and [[Capua]], defended by [[Prospero Colonna|Prospero]] and [[Fabrizio Colonna]]</span>
				<span class='text'>On 24 June 1501 his troops stormed the latter, causing the collapse of Aragonese power in southern Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>n June 1502 he set out for Marche, where he was able to capture [[Urbino]] and [[Camerino]] by treason</span>
				<span class='text'>He planned to conquer [[Bologna]] next</span>
				<span class='text'>However, his ''condottieri'', most notably Vitellozzo Vitelli and the Orsini brothers ([[Giulio Orsini|Giulio]], Paolo and Francesco), feared Cesare's cruelty and set up a plot against him</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Guidobaldo da Montefeltro]] and [[Giovanni Maria da Varano]] returned to Urbino and Camerino, and [[Fossombrone]] revolted</span>
				<span class='text'>The fact that his subjects had enjoyed his rule thus far meant that his opponents had to work much harder than they would have liked</span>
				<span class='text'>He eventually recalled his loyal generals to Imola, where he waited for his opponents' loose alliance to collapse</span>
				<span class='text'>Cesare called for a reconciliation, but imprisoned his ''condottieri'' in [[Senigallia]], then called Sinigaglia, a feat described as a &quot;wonderful deceiving&quot; by [[Paolo Giovio]],&lt;ref&gt;Rendina, p</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|300px|''Cesare Borgia leaving the Vatican'' (1877) by [[Giuseppe Lorenzo Gatteri]]]]Although he was an immensely capable general and statesman, Cesare had trouble maintaining his domain without continued Papal patronage</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Niccolò Machiavelli]] cites Cesare's dependence on the good will of the Papacy, under the control of his father, to be the principal disadvantage of his rule</span>
				<span class='text'>Machiavelli argued that, had Cesare been able to win the favor of the new Pope, he would have been a very successful ruler</span>
				<span class='text'>The news of his father's death (1503) arrived when Cesare was planning the conquest of [[Tuscany]]</span>
				<span class='text'>While he was convalescing in [[Castel Sant'Angelo]], his troops controlled the conclave</span>
				<span class='text'>he new pope, [[Pius III]], supported Cesare Borgia and reconfirmed him as [[Gonfalonier]]; but after a brief pontificate of twenty-six days he died</span>
				<span class='text'>Borgia's deadly enemy, Giuliano Della Rovere, then succeeded by dexterous diplomacy in tricking the weakened Cesare Borgia into supporting him by offering him money and continued papal backing for Borgia policies in the Romagna; promises which he disregarded upon election</span>
				<span class='text'>He was elected as [[Pope Julius II]] to the papal dignity by the near-unanimous vote of the cardinals</span>
				<span class='text'>Realizing his mistake by then, Cesare tried to correct the situation to his favor, but Pope Julius II made sure of its failure at every turn</span>

				<span class='text'>In the early morning of 11 March 1507, an enemy party of knights fled from the castle during a heavy storm</span>
				<span class='text'>Outraged at the ineffectiveness of the siege, the Italian commander chased them only to find himself on his own</span>
				<span class='text'>The party of knights discovered Borgia was alone, and trapped him in an ambush</span>
				<span class='text'>Borgia received a fatal injury from a spear</span>
				<span class='text'>He was then stripped of all his luxurious garments, valuables and a leather mask covering half his face (disfigured possibly by [[syphilis]] during his late years)</span>
				<span class='text'>Borgia was left lying naked, with just a red tile covering his genitals</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=BK11 /&gt;==Remains==Borgia was originally buried in a marbled mausoleum John III had ordered built at the altar of the Church of [[Santa María (Viana)|Santa María]] in Viana, set on one of the stops on the [[Camino de Santiago]]</span>

				<span class='text'>While the circumstances are not well known, the tomb was destroyed sometime between 1523 and 1608, during which time Santa María was undergoing renovation and expansion</span>
				<span class='text'>Tradition goes that a [[bishop of Calahorra]] considered inappropriate to have the remains of &quot;that degenerate&quot; lying in the church, so the opportunity was taken to tear down the monument and expel Borgia's bones to where they were reburied under the street in front of the church to be trodden on by all who walked through the town</span>
				<span class='text'>[Vicente Blasco Ibáñez]], in ''[[A los pies de Venus]]'', writes that the then Bishop of Santa María had Borgia expelled from the church because his own father had died after being imprisoned under Alexander VI</span>
				<span class='text'>It was held for many years that the bones were lost, although in fact local tradition continued to mark their place quite accurately and folklore sprung up around Borgia's death and ghost</span>
				<span class='text'>The bones were in fact dug up twice and reburied once by historians (both local and international—the first dig in 1886 involved the French historian [[Charles Yriarte]], who also published works on the Borgias) seeking the resting place of the infamous Cesare Borgia</span>
				<span class='text'>After Borgia was unearthed for the second time in 1945 his bones were taken for a rather lengthy forensic examination by [[Victoriano Juaristi]], a surgeon by trade and Borgia aficionado, and the tests concurred with the preliminary ones carried out in the 19th century</span>
				<span class='text'>There was evidence that the bones belonged to Borgia</span>
				<span class='text'>esare Borgia's remains then were sent to Viana's town hall, directly across from Santa María, where they remained until 1953</span>
				<span class='text'>They were then reburied immediately outside of the Church of Santa María, no longer under the street and in direct danger of being stepped on</span>
				<span class='text'>A memorial stone{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} was placed over it which translated into English declared Borgia the ''Generalisimo'' of the papal as well as the Navarrese forces</span>
				<span class='text'>A movement was made in the late 80s to have Borgia dug up once more and put back into Santa María, but this proposal was ultimately rejected by church officials due to recent ruling against the interment of anyone who did not hold the title of pope or cardinal</span>
				<span class='text'>Since Borgia had renounced the cardinalate it was decided that it would be inappropriate for his bones to be moved into the church</span>
				<span class='text'>However, [[Fernando Sebastián Aguilar]], the Archbishop of Pamplona, caved in after more than 50 years of petitions and Borgia was finally moved back inside the church on 11 March 2007, the day before the 500th anniversary of his death</span>
