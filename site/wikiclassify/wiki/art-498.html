				<span class='text'>One of his first pieces, the &quot;[[Maple Leaf Rag]]&quot;, became ragtime's first and most influential hit, and has been recognized as the archetypal rag</span>

				<span class='text'>Joplin grew up in [[Texarkana, Texas|Texarkana]], where he formed a vocal quartet, and taught mandolin and guitar</span>
				<span class='text'>During the late 1880s he left his job as a laborer with the railroad, and travelled around the [[Southern United States|American South]] as an itinerant musician</span>
				<span class='text'>He went to Chicago for the [[World's Columbian Exposition|World's Fair]] of 1893, which played a major part in making ragtime a national craze by 1897</span>
				<span class='text'>oplin moved to [[Sedalia, Missouri]], in 1894 and earned a living as a piano teacher; there he taught future ragtime composers [[Arthur Marshall (composer)|Arthur Marshall]], [[Scott Hayden]] and [[Brun Campbell]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Joplin began publishing music in 1895, and publication of his &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot; in 1899 brought him fame</span>
				<span class='text'>This piece had a profound influence on subsequent writers of ragtime</span>
				<span class='text'>It also brought the composer a steady income for life, though Joplin did not reach this level of success again and frequently had financial problems</span>

				<span class='text'>He attempted to go beyond the limitations of the musical form that made him famous, without much monetary success</span>
				<span class='text'>His second opera, ''[[Treemonisha]]'', was not received well at its partially staged performance in 1915</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1916 Joplin descended into [[dementia]] as a result of [[syphilis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was admitted to a mental institution in January 1917, and died there three months later at the age of 49</span>
				<span class='text'>Joplin's death is widely considered to mark the end of ragtime as a mainstream music format, and in the next several years it evolved with other styles into [[Stride (music)|stride]], [[jazz]], and eventually big band swing</span>
				<span class='text'>His music was rediscovered and returned to popularity in the early 1970s with the release of a million-selling album recorded by [[Joshua Rifkin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This was followed by the Academy Award–winning 1973 movie ''[[The Sting]]'' that featured several of his compositions including &quot;[[The Entertainer (rag)|The Entertainer]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The opera ''Treemonisha'' was finally produced in full to wide acclaim in 1972</span>

				<span class='text'>Berlin, &quot;One tenacious myth tells us that Joplin was born in Texarkana, Texas, on November 24, 1868</span>
				<span class='text'>The location is easily dispensed with: Texarkana was not established until 1873</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;  However, based on a letter discovered by musicologist John Tennison in 2015 in the December 19, 1856 edition of the Times-Picayune, it is clear that Texarkana was established as a place-name by no later than 1856</span>
				<span class='text'> Consequently, it appears possible that Joplin, born 12 years later, could have been born in Texarkana</span>
				<span class='text'> Nonetheless, and despite evidence to support such a conclusion, some insist that Joplin was born in [[Linden, Texas]], either in late 1867 or early 1868</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;At some point in the early 1880s, Giles Joplin left the family for another woman, leaving Florence, his wife, to provide for her children through domestic work</span>
				<span class='text'>Biographer Susan Curtis speculated that his mother's support of Joplin's musical education was an important causal factor in this separation</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;According to a family friend, the young Joplin was serious and ambitious, studying music and playing the piano after school</span>
				<span class='text'>While a few local teachers aided him, he received most of his music education from [[Julius Weiss]], a [[Germany|German]] born music professor who had immigrated to Texas in the late 1860s and was employed as music tutor to a prominent local business-family</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Albrecht/&gt; Weiss had studied music at university in Germany and was listed in town records as a ''Professor of music''</span>
				<span class='text'>Impressed by Joplin's talent, and realizing his family's dire straits, Weiss taught him free of charge</span>
				<span class='text'>He tutored the 11-year-old Joplin until he was 16, during which time Weiss introduced him to [[Folk music|folk]] and classical music, including opera</span>
				<span class='text'>Weiss helped Joplin appreciate music as an &quot;art as well as an entertainment,&quot;&lt;ref name=Berlin7-8/&gt; and helped his mother acquire a used piano</span>
				<span class='text'>According to his wife, Lottie, Joplin never forgot Weiss and in his later years, when he achieved fame as a composer, sent his former teacher &quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>While in Chicago, he formed his first band playing [[cornet]] and began arranging music for the group to perform</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the World's Fair minimized the involvement of African-Americans, black performers still came to the saloons, cafés and brothels that lined the fair</span>
				<span class='text'>The exposition was attended by 27 million Americans and had a profound effect on many areas of American cultural life, including ragtime</span>
				<span class='text'>Although specific information is sparse, numerous sources have credited the Chicago World Fair with spreading the popularity of ragtime</span>

				<span class='text'>He performed in the Queen City Cornet Band, and his own six-piece dance orchestra</span>
				<span class='text'>A tour with his own singing group, the Texas Medley Quartet, gave him his first opportunity to publish his own compositions and it is known that he went to [[Syracuse, New York]] and Texas</span>
				<span class='text'>Two businessmen from New York published Joplin's first two works, the songs &quot;Please Say You Will&quot;, and &quot;A Picture of her Face&quot; in 1895</span>

				<span class='text'>Although there were hundreds of rags in print by the time the &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot; was published, Joplin was not far behind</span>
				<span class='text'>His first published rag, &quot;[[Original Rags]]&quot;, had been completed in 1897, the same year as the first ragtime work in print, the &quot;Mississippi Rag&quot; by [[William Krell]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot; was likely to have been known in Sedalia before its publication in 1899; Brun Campbell claimed to have seen the manuscript of the work in around 1898</span>

				<span class='text'>47, 52</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The exact circumstances that led to the Maple Leaf Rag's publication are unknown, and a number of versions of the event contradict each other</span>
				<span class='text'>After several unsuccessful approaches to publishers, Joplin signed a contract on August 10, 1899 with [[John Stillwell Stark]], a retailer of musical instruments who later became his most important publisher</span>
				<span class='text'>The contract stipulated that Joplin would receive a 1% royalty on all sales of the rag, with a minimum sales price of 25 cents</span>

				<span class='text'>56, 58</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; With the inscription &quot;To the Maple Leaf Club&quot; prominently visible along the top of at least some editions, it is likely that the rag was named after the Maple Leaf Club, although there is no direct evidence to prove the link, and there were many other possible sources for the name in and around Sedalia at the time</span>

				<span class='text'>Berlin demonstrated that this was not the case; the initial print-run of 400 took one year to sell, and under the terms of Joplin's contract with a 1% royalty would have given Joplin an income of $4 (or approximately ${{Formatnum:{{Inflation|US|4|1899|r=0}}}}&amp;nbsp;at current prices)</span>
				<span class='text'>Later sales were steady, and would have given Joplin an income that would have covered his expenses</span>

				<span class='text'>gg|title2=The Entertainer}}The combination of classical music, the musical atmosphere present around Texarkana (including work songs, gospel hymns, spirituals and dance music) and Joplin's natural ability has been cited as contributing significantly to the invention of a new style that blended African-American musical styles with European forms and melodies, and first became celebrated in the 1890s: [[ragtime]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Curtis38/&gt;When Joplin was learning the piano, serious musical circles condemned ragtime because of its association with the vulgar and inane songs &quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>playing mere dance music&quot; of popular imagination</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Whitcomb/&gt; This new art form, the [[classic rag]], combined Afro-American folk music's [[syncopation]] and [[Romantic music|19th-century European romanticism]], with its harmonic schemes and its march-like tempos</span>

				<span class='text'>67–68</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In the words of one critic, &quot;Ragtime was basically</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>an Afro-American version of the polka, or its analog, the [[John Philip Sousa|Sousa]]-style march</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Williams|Williams (1987)]]&lt;/ref&gt; With this as a foundation, Joplin intended his compositions to be played exactly as he wrote them&amp;nbsp;– without improvisation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Scott37/&gt; Joplin wrote his rags as &quot;classical&quot; music in miniature form in order to raise ragtime above its &quot;cheap bordello&quot; origins and produced work that opera historian Elise Kirk described as, &quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>more tuneful, contrapuntal, infectious, and harmonically colorful than any others of his era</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Joplin's first and most significant hit, the &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot;, was described as the archetype of the classic rag, and influenced subsequent rag composers for at least 12 years after its initial publication thanks to its rhythmic patterns, melody lines, and harmony,&lt;ref name=&quot;Blesh 1981 p</span>

				<span class='text'>In addition the themes of superstition and mysticism evident in ''Treemonisha'' are common in the operatic tradition, and certain aspects of the plot echo devices in the work of the German composer [[Richard Wagner]] (of which Joplin was aware)</span>
				<span class='text'>A sacred tree Treemonisha sits beneath recalls the tree that Siegmund takes his enchanted sword from in ''[[Die Walküre]]'', and the retelling of the heroine's origins echos aspects of the opera ''[[Siegfried (opera)|Siegfried]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, African-American folk tales also influence the story—the wasp nest incident is similar to the story of [[Br'er Rabbit]] and the briar patch</span>

				<span class='text'>203–204</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;''Treemonisha'' is not a ragtime opera—because Joplin employed the styles of ragtime and other black music sparingly, using them to convey &quot;racial character,&quot; and to celebrate the music of his childhood at the end of the 19th century</span>
				<span class='text'>The opera has been seen as a valuable record of rural black music from late 19th century re-created by a &quot;skilled and sensitive participant</span>

				<span class='text'>202, 204</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Berlin speculates about parallels between the plot and Joplin's own life</span>
				<span class='text'>He notes that Lottie Joplin (the composer's third wife) saw a connection between the character Treemonisha's wish to lead her people out of ignorance, and a similar desire in the composer</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, it has been speculated that Treemonisha represents Freddie, Joplin's second wife, because the date of the opera's setting was likely to have been the month of her birth</span>
