				<span class='text'>In 1932 they renamed it The Gene Kelly Studio of the Dance</span>
				<span class='text'>They opened a second location in [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania]] in 1933</span>
				<span class='text'>Kelly served as a teacher at the studio during his undergraduate and law student years at Pitt</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1931 he was approached by the [[Rodef Shalom Temple|Rodef Shalom synagogue]] in Pittsburgh to teach dance, and to stage the annual Kermess</span>
				<span class='text'>This venture was successful enough that they retained his services for seven years, until he departed for New York</span>

				<span class='text'>He began to increasingly focus on performing, and later claimed: &quot;With time I became disenchanted with teaching because the ratio of girls to boys was more than ten to one, and once the girls reached sixteen the dropout rate was very high</span>

				<span class='text'>Kelly appeared in six of the sketches, one of which, ''[[La Cumparsita]]'', became the basis of an extended Spanish number in the film ''[[Anchors Aweigh (film)]]'' eight years later</span>
				<span class='text'>is first [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] assignment, in November 1938, was as a dancer in [[Cole Porter]]'s ''[[Leave It to Me!]]''—as the American ambassador's secretary who supports [[Mary Martin]] while she sings ''[[My Heart Belongs to Daddy]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>He had been hired by [[Robert Alton]], who had staged a show at the Pittsburgh Playhouse where he was impressed by Kelly's teaching skills</span>
				<span class='text'>When Alton moved on to choreograph ''One for the Money'' he hired Kelly to act, sing, and dance in eight routines</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1939, he was selected for a musical revue, ''One for the Money'', produced by the actress [[Katharine Cornell]], who was known for finding and hiring talented young actors</span>
				<span class='text'>elly's first big breakthrough was in the [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning ''[[The Time of Your Life]]'', which opened on October 25, 1939—in which, for the first time on Broadway, he danced to his own choreography</span>
				<span class='text'>In the same year he received his first assignment as a Broadway choreographer, for ''[[Billy Rose]]'s Diamond Horseshoe''</span>
				<span class='text'>He began dating a cast member, [[Betsy Blair]], and they got married on October 16, 1941</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1940 he got the lead role in [[Rodgers and Hart]]'s ''[[Pal Joey (musical)|Pal Joey]]'', again choreographed by Robert Alton</span>
				<span class='text'>This role propelled him to stardom</span>
				<span class='text'>During its run he told reporters: &quot;I don't believe in conformity to any school of dancing</span>
				<span class='text'>I create what the drama and the music demand</span>
				<span class='text'>While I am a hundred percent for ballet technique, I use only what I can adapt to my own use</span>
				<span class='text'>I never let technique get in the way of mood or continuity</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas&quot; /&gt; His colleagues at this time noticed his great commitment to rehearsal and hard work</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Van Johnson]]—who also appeared in ''Pal Joey''—recalled: &quot;I watched him rehearsing, and it seemed to me that there was no possible room for improvement</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet he wasn't satisfied</span>
				<span class='text'>It was midnight and we had been rehearsing since eight in the morning</span>

				<span class='text'>His first opportunity to dance to his own choreography came in his next picture ''[[Thousands Cheer]]'' (1943), where he performed a mock-love dance with a mop</span>
				<span class='text'>e achieved a significant breakthrough as a dancer on film when MGM loaned him to [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]] to work with [[Rita Hayworth]] in ''[[Cover Girl (film)|Cover Girl]]'' (1944), a film that foreshadowed the best of his future work</span>

				<span class='text'>Despite this, noted critic [[Manny Farber]] was moved to praise Kelly's &quot;attitude,&quot; &quot;clarity,&quot; and &quot;feeling&quot; as an actor while inauspiciously concluding, &quot;The two things he does least well - singing and dancing - are what he is given most consistently to do</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Farber, Manny, The New Republic, May 15, 1944, as reprinted in 'Farber on Film,' Library of America, 2009, pg</span>

				<span class='text'>He was stationed in the Photographic Section, Washington D</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> where he was involved in writing and directing a range of documentaries, and this stimulated his interest in the production side of film-making</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Hirschhorn&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to Blair, p</span>
				<span class='text'>11, he directed [[Jocelyn Brando]] in a semi-documentary about war-wounded veterans</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In Kelly's next film, ''[[Anchors Aweigh (film)|Anchors Aweigh]]'' (1945), MGM gave him a free hand to devise a range of dance routines—including a celebrated animated dance with [[Tom and Jerry|Jerry Mouse]], and his duets with co-star [[Frank Sinatra]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The iconic performance was enough for Manny Farber to completely reverse his previous assessment of Kelly's skills</span>
				<span class='text'>Reviewing the film, Farber enthused, &quot;Kelly is the most exciting dancer to appear in Hollywood movies</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Farber, Manny, The New Republic, August 27, 1945, as reprinted in 'Farber on Film,' Library of America, 2009, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>255&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Anchors Aweigh'' became one of the most successful films of 1945 and it garnered Kelly his first and only [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''[[Ziegfeld Follies (film)|Ziegfeld Follies]]'' (1946) – which was produced in 1944 but not released until 1946 – Kelly collaborated with [[Fred Astaire]] – for whom he had the greatest admiration – in the famous &quot;The Babbitt and the Bromide&quot; challenge dance routine</span>
				<span class='text'>==1946–1952: MGM===On his return to Hollywood in the spring of 1946, MGM had nothing planned and used him in a routine, black-and-white movie: ''[[Living in a Big Way]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The film was considered so weak that the studio asked Kelly to design and insert a series of dance routines, and they noticed his ability to carry off such assignments</span>
				<span class='text'>This led to a lead part in his next picture, with [[Judy Garland]] and director [[Vincente Minnelli]]— a musical film version of [[S</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Behrman]]'s play, ''[[The Pirate]]'', with songs by [[Cole Porter]], in which Kelly plays the lead</span>
				<span class='text'>''The Pirate'' gave full rein to Kelly's athleticism</span>
				<span class='text'>It is also notable for Kelly's work with [[The Nicholas Brothers]] – the leading black dancers of their day – in a virtuoso dance routine</span>
				<span class='text'>Now regarded as a classic, the film was ahead of its time, but flopped at the box-office</span>
				<span class='text'>GM wanted Kelly to return to safer and more commercial vehicles, but he ceaselessly fought for an opportunity to direct his own musical film</span>
				<span class='text'>In the interim, he capitalized on his swashbuckling image as [[d'Artagnan]] in ''[[The Three Musketeers (1948 film)|The Three Musketeers]]''—and also appeared with [[Vera-Ellen]] in the ''[[Slaughter on Tenth Avenue]]'' ballet in ''[[Words and Music (1948 film)|Words and Music]]'' (1948)</span>
				<span class='text'>He was due to play the male lead opposite Garland in ''[[Easter Parade (film)|Easter Parade]]'' (1948), but broke his ankle playing volleyball</span>
				<span class='text'>He withdrew from the film and convinced [[Fred Astaire]] to come out of retirement to replace him</span>

				<span class='text'>Patrick's Day'' routine</span>
				<span class='text'>This musical film persuaded Arthur Freed to have Kelly make ''[[On the Town (film)|On the Town]]'', in which he partnered with Frank Sinatra for the third and final time</span>
				<span class='text'>A breakthrough in the musical film genre, it has been described as &quot;the most inventive and effervescent musical thus far produced in Hollywood</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas&quot; /&gt;[[File:Gene Kelly American in Paris</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|upright|''[[An American in Paris (film)|An American in Paris]]'' (1951)]][[Stanley Donen]], brought to Hollywood by Kelly to be his assistant choreographer, received co-director credit for ''On the Town''</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Kelly: &quot;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>hen you are involved in doing choreography for film you must have expert assistants</span>
				<span class='text'>I needed one to watch my performance, and one to work with the cameraman on the timing</span>
				<span class='text'>without such people as Stanley, [[Carol Haney]] and [[Jeanne Coyne]] I could never have done these things</span>
				<span class='text'>When we came to do ''On the Town'', I knew it was time for Stanley to get screen credit because we weren't boss-assistant anymore but co-creators</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blair, p</span>
				<span class='text'>04: &quot;Gene was the central creative force in this initial collaboration, but he was always generous about Stanley's contribution</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>nfortunately, and mysteriously for me, Stanley, over the years, had been less than gracious about Gene&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Together, they opened up the musical form, taking the film musical out of the studio and into real locations, with Donen taking responsibility for the staging and Kelly handling the choreography</span>
				<span class='text'>Kelly went much further than before in introducing modern ballet into his dance sequences, going so far in the &quot;Day in New York&quot; routine as to substitute four leading ballet specialists for Sinatra, Munshin, Garrett and Miller</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Hirschhorn&quot; /&gt;Kelly asked the studio for a straight acting role and he took the lead role in the early [[mafia]] melodrama: ''[[Black Hand (1950 film)|Black Hand]]'' (1950)</span>
				<span class='text'>This exposé of organized crime is set in New York's &quot;Little Italy&quot; during late 19th century, and focuses on the Black Hand, a group which extorts money upon threat of death</span>
				<span class='text'>In real-life incidents upon which this film is based, it was the Mafia, not the Black Hand, who functioned as the villain</span>
				<span class='text'>Even in 1950, however, Hollywood had to tread gingerly whenever dealing with big-time crime, it being safer to go after a &quot;dead&quot; criminal organization than a &quot;live&quot; one</span>
				<span class='text'>There followed ''[[Summer Stock]]'' (1950) – Garland's last musical film for MGM – in which Kelly performed the celebrated &quot;You, You Wonderful You&quot; solo routine with a newspaper and a squeaky floorboard</span>
				<span class='text'>In his book &quot;Easy the Hard Way&quot;, [[Joe Pasternak]], head of one of the other musical units within MGM, singled out Kelly for his patience and willingness to spend as much time as necessary to enable the ailing Garland to complete her part</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas&quot; /&gt;[[File:Singin Rain</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|right|thumb|''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'' (1952)]]There followed in quick succession two musicals which have secured Kelly's reputation as a major figure in the American musical film, ''[[An American in Paris (film)|An American in Paris]]'' (1951) and – probably the most popular and admired of all film musicals – ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'' (1952)</span>
				<span class='text'>As co-director, lead star and choreographer, Kelly was the central driving force</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Johnny Green]], head of music at MGM at the time, said of him:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Gene is easygoing as long as you know exactly what you are doing when you're working with him</span>
				<span class='text'>He's a hard taskmaster and he loves hard work</span>
				<span class='text'>If you want to play on his team you'd better like hard work, too</span>
				<span class='text'>He isn't cruel but he is tough, and if Gene believed in something he didn't care who he was talking to, whether it was [[Louis B</span>

				<span class='text'>The film also marked the debut of [[Leslie Caron]], who Kelly had spotted in Paris and brought to Hollywood</span>
				<span class='text'>Its dream ballet sequence, lasting an unprecedented seventeen minutes, was the most expensive production number ever filmed at that time</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Bosley Crowther]] described it as, &quot;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>

				<span class='text'>Though the film did not initially generate the same enthusiasm as ''An American in Paris'', it subsequently overtook the earlier film to occupy its current pre-eminent place among critics and filmgoers alike</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;In 1994, [[Kurt Browning]], offered an ice skating interpretation of ''Singin' in the Rain'' on his television special ''You Must Remember This''</span>
				<span class='text'>In 2005, Kelly's widow gave permission for [[Volkswagen]] to use his likeness to promote the [[Golf GTi]] car</span>
				<span class='text'>The advertisement, shown only outside the US, used [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] to mix footage of Gene Kelly, from ''Singin' in the Rain'', with footage of professional breakdancer [[David Elsewhere]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===1953–57: The decline of the Hollywood musical===Kelly, at the peak of his creative powers, now made what in retrospect some see as a mistake</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Hirschhorn&quot; /&gt; In December 1951, he signed a contract with MGM that sent him to Europe for nineteen months to use MGM funds frozen in Europe to make three pictures while personally benefiting from tax exemptions</span>
				<span class='text'>Only one of these pictures was a musical, ''[[Invitation to the Dance (film)|Invitation to the Dance]]'', a pet project of Kelly's to bring modern ballet to mainstream film audiences</span>
				<span class='text'>It was beset with delays and technical problems, and flopped when finally released in 1956</span>
				<span class='text'>When Kelly returned to Hollywood in 1953, the film musical was already beginning to feel the pressures from television, and MGM cut the budget for his next picture ''[[Brigadoon (film)|Brigadoon]]'' (1954), with Cyd Charisse, forcing him to make the film on studio back lots instead of on location in Scotland</span>
				<span class='text'>This year also saw him appear as guest star with his brother Fred in the celebrated ''I Love to Go Swimmin' with Wimmen'' routine in ''[[Deep in My Heart (1954 film)|Deep in My Heart]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>MGM's refusal to loan him out for ''[[Guys and Dolls (film)|Guys and Dolls]]'' and ''[[Pal Joey (film)|Pal Joey]]'' put further strains on his relationship with the studio</span>
				<span class='text'>He negotiated an exit to his contract which involved making three further pictures for MGM</span>
				<span class='text'>The first of these, ''[[It's Always Fair Weather]]'' (1956) co-directed with Donen, was a musical satire on television and advertising, and includes his famous roller skate dance routine to ''I Like Myself'', and a dance trio with [[Michael Kidd]] and [[Dan Dailey]] that Kelly used to experiment with the widescreen possibilities of [[Cinemascope]]</span>
				<span class='text'>MGM had lost faith in Kelly's box-office appeal, and as a result ''It's Always Fair Weather'' &quot;premiered&quot; at seventeen drive-in theatres around the [[Los Angeles]] metroplex</span>
				<span class='text'>Next followed Kelly's last musical film for MGM, ''[[Les Girls]]'' (1957), in which he partnered a trio of leading ladies, [[Mitzi Gaynor]], [[Kay Kendall]] and [[Taina Elg]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It too sold few movie tickets</span>
				<span class='text'>The third picture he completed was a co-production between MGM and himself, a cheapie B-film ''[[The Happy Road]]'', set in his beloved France, his first foray in a new role as producer-director-actor</span>
				<span class='text'>After leaving MGM, Kelly returned to stage work</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;In an episode foreshadowing his later conflicts with the studio, [[Elia Kazan]] in the late 1940s offered Kelly the role of Biff in ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'' on Broadway, but MGM refused to release him</span>

				<span class='text'>Julien, the general administrator of the [[Palais Garnier|Paris Opéra]] and [[Opéra-Comique]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas&quot; /&gt; to select his own material and create a modern ballet for the company, the first time an American had received such an assignment</span>
				<span class='text'>The result was ''Pas de Dieux'', based on [[Greek mythology]], combined with the music of [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Concerto in F (Gershwin)|Concerto in F]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>It was a major success, and led to his being honored with the Chevalier of the [[Legion d'Honneur]] by the French Government</span>
				<span class='text'>Kelly continued to make some film appearances, such as Hornbeck in the 1960 Hollywood production of ''[[Inherit the Wind (1960 film)|Inherit the Wind]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>However, most of his efforts were now concentrated on film production and directing</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1962 he directed [[Jackie Gleason]] in ''[[Gigot (film)|Gigot]]'' in Paris, but the film was drastically re-cut by [[Seven Arts Productions]] and flopped</span>

				<span class='text'>He appeared as himself in [[George Cukor]]'s ''[[Let's Make Love]]'' (1960)</span>
				<span class='text'>e was asked to direct the film, Sound of Music, which had been turned down earlier by [[Stanley Donen]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Hirschhorn&quot; /&gt; It gained an [[Emmy]] nomination for choreography and now stands as the key document explaining Kelly's approach to modern dance</span>
				<span class='text'>elly also appeared frequently on television shows during the 1960s</span>
				<span class='text'>However, his one effort at a television series—as Father Chuck O'Malley in ''[[Going My Way (TV series)|Going My Way]]'' (1962–63), based on the [[Going My Way|Best Picture of 1944]] starring [[Bing Crosby]]—was dropped after thirty episodes, though it enjoyed great popularity in Roman Catholic countries outside the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Hirschhorn&quot; /&gt;He also appeared in three major TV specials: ''New York, New York'' (1966), ''The Julie Andrews' Show'' (1965), and ''[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]'' (1967)—a show he produced and directed that again combined cartoon animation and live dance, winning him an [[Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Children's Program</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1963, Kelly joined [[Universal Pictures]] for a two-year stint</span>
				<span class='text'>He joined [[20th Century Fox]] in 1965, but had little to do—partly due to his decision to decline assignments away from Los Angeles for family reasons</span>
				<span class='text'>His perseverance finally paid off, with the major box-office hit ''[[A Guide for the Married Man]]'' (1967) where he directed [[Walter Matthau]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Then, a major opportunity arose when Fox – buoyed by the returns from ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'' (1965) – commissioned Kelly to direct ''[[Hello, Dolly! (film)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' (1969), again directing Matthau along with [[Barbra Streisand]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and won three</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1970 he made another TV special: ''Gene Kelly and 50 Girls'' and was invited to bring the show to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]—which he did for an eight-week stint on the condition he be paid more than any artist had ever been paid there</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Hirschhorn&quot; /&gt; He directed veteran actors [[James Stewart]] and [[Henry Fonda]] in the comedy western ''[[The Cheyenne Social Club]]'' (1970) which performed poorly at the box-office</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1973, he worked again with [[Frank Sinatra]] as part of Sinatra's [[Emmy]] nominated TV special, ''[[Magnavox Presents Frank Sinatra]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Then, in 1974, he appeared as one of many special narrators in the surprise hit of the year ''[[That's Entertainment!]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>He subsequently directed and co-starred with his friend [[Fred Astaire]] in the sequel ''[[That's Entertainment, Part II]]'' (1976)</span>
				<span class='text'>It was a measure of his powers of persuasion that he managed to coax the 77-year-old Astaire – who had insisted that his contract rule out any dancing, having long since retired—into performing a series of song and dance duets, evoking a powerful nostalgia for the glory days of the American musical film</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1977 Kelly starred in the poorly received action film [[Viva Knievel]], with the popular stuntman, [[Evel Knievel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Kelly continued to make frequent TV appearances and, in 1980, appeared in an acting and dancing role with [[Olivia Newton-John]] in ''[[Xanadu (film)|Xanadu]]'' (1980)—an expensive theatrical flop that has since attained a cult following</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Hirschhorn&quot; /&gt; In Kelly's opinion, &quot;The concept was marvelous but it just didn't come off</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas&quot; /&gt; In the same year, he was invited by [[Francis Ford Coppola]] to recruit a production staff for American Zoetrope's ''[[One from the Heart]]'' (1982)</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Coppola's ambition was for him to establish a production unit to rival the [[Arthur Freed|Freed Unit]] at MGM, the film's failure put an end to this idea</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Hirschhorn&quot; /&gt; In 1985 Kelly served as executive producer and co-host of ''[[That's Dancing!]]'' – a celebration of the history of dance in the American musical</span>
				<span class='text'>Kelly's final on-screen appearance was to introduce ''[[That's Entertainment! III]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>His final film project was in 1994 for the animated film ''[[Cats Don't Dance]]'', released in 1997 and dedicated to him, on which Kelly acted as an uncredited choreographic consultant</span>
				<span class='text'>=Working methods and influence on filmed dance==When he began his collaborative film work, he was influenced by [[Robert Alton]] and [[John Murray Anderson]], striving to create moods and character insight with his dances</span>

				<span class='text'>It's an Irish quality, a jaw-jutting, up-on-the-toes cockiness – which is a good quality for a male dancer to have</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas&quot; /&gt; He was also heavily influenced by an [[African-American]] dancer, Dancing Dotson, whom he saw perform at [[Heinz Hall for the Performing Arts|Loew's Penn Theatre]] around 1929</span>
				<span class='text'>He was briefly taught by Frank Harrington, an African-American tap specialist from New York</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;cf</span>
				<span class='text'>Hirschhorn, p</span>
				<span class='text'>5,26: &quot;What impressed Gene was the originality of the man's [Dotson's] dancing, as it was quite unlike anything he'd seen before</span>
				<span class='text'>The tricks Dotson was doing were absolutely fresh</span>
				<span class='text'>He went back to see that act a couple of times, and admitted pinching several steps for his own use</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>ust as he had done with Dotson, Gene made up his mind to 'steal' as much as he could from numerous touring shows</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>oth he and Fred were absolutely shameless when it came to pilfering, and very good at it</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt; However, his main interest was in [[ballet]], which he studied under Kotchetovsky in the early Thirties</span>
				<span class='text'>As biographer [[Clive Hirschhorn]] explains: &quot;As a child he used to run for miles through parks and streets and woods – anywhere, just as long as he could feel the wind against his body and through his hair</span>
				<span class='text'>Ballet gave him the same feeling of exhilaration, and in 1933 he was convinced it was the most satisfying form of self-expression</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hirschhorn&quot; /&gt; He also studied Spanish dancing under Angel Cansino, [[Rita Hayworth]]'s uncle</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Hirschhorn&quot; /&gt; Generally speaking, he tended to use tap and other popular dance idioms to express joy and exuberance – as in the title song from ''Singin' in the Rain'' or &quot;I Got Rhythm&quot; from ''An American in Paris'', whereas pensive or romantic feelings were more often expressed via ballet or modern dance, as in &quot;Heather on the Hill&quot; from ''Brigadoon'' or &quot;[[Our Love Is Here to Stay]]&quot; from ''An American in Paris''</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Kelly in rehearsal with [[Sugar Ray Robinson]] and assistant [[Jeanne Coyne]] in the [[NBC]] ''[[Omnibus (U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>TV series)|Omnibus]]'' television special ''Dancing is a Man's Game'' (1958)]]According to Delamater, Kelly's work &quot;seems to represent the fulfillment of dance-film integration in the 1940s and 1950s&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>While [[Fred Astaire]] had revolutionized the filming of dance in the 1930s by insisting on full-figure photography of dancers while allowing only a modest degree of camera movement, Kelly freed up the camera, making greater use of space, camera movement, camera angles and editing, creating a partnership between dance movement and camera movement without sacrificing full-figure framing</span>
				<span class='text'>Kelly's reasoning behind this was that he felt the kinetic force of live dance often evaporated when brought to film, and he sought to partially overcome this by involving the camera in movement and giving the dancer a greater number of directions in which to move</span>
				<span class='text'>Examples of this abound in Kelly's work and are well illustrated in the &quot;Prehistoric Man&quot; sequence from ''On the Town'' and &quot;The Hat My Father Wore on St</span>
				<span class='text'>Patrick's Day&quot; from ''Take Me Out to the Ball Game''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Delamater&quot; /&gt; In 1951, he summed up his vision as follows: &quot;If the camera is to make a contribution at all to dance, this must be the focal point of its contribution; the fluid background, giving each spectator an undistorted and altogether similar view of dancer and background</span>
				<span class='text'>To accomplish this, the camera is made fluid, moving with the dancer, so that the lens becomes the eye of the spectator, ''your eye''&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Billman&quot; /&gt;Kelly's athleticism gave his moves a distinctive broad, muscular quality,&lt;ref name=&quot;Delamater&quot; /&gt; and this was a very deliberate choice on his part, as he explained: &quot;There's a strong link between sports and dancing, and my own dancing springs from my early days as an athlete</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> think dancing is a man's game and if he does it well he does it better than a woman</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas&quot; /&gt; He railed against what he saw as the widespread effeminacy in male dancing which, in his opinion, &quot;tragically&quot; stigmatized the genre, alienating boys from entering the field: &quot;Dancing ''does'' attract effeminate young men</span>
				<span class='text'>I don't object to that as long as they don't dance effeminately</span>
				<span class='text'>I just say that if a man dances effeminately he dances badly — just as if a woman comes out on stage and starts to sing bass</span>
				<span class='text'>Unfortunately, people confuse gracefulness with softness</span>
				<span class='text'>[[John Wayne]] is a graceful man and so are some of the great ball players</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>ut, of course, they don't run the risk of being called sissies</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas&quot; /&gt; In his view, &quot;one of our problems is that so much dancing is taught by women</span>
				<span class='text'>You can spot many male dancers who have this tuition by their arm movements — they are soft, limp and feminine</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas&quot; /&gt; He acknowledged that, in spite of his efforts — in TV programs such as ''Dancing: A Man's Game'' (1958) for example — the situation changed little over the years</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas&quot; /&gt;He also sought to break from the class-conscious conventions of the 1930s and early 40s, when top hat and tails or tuxedos were the norm, by dancing in casual or everyday work clothes, so as to make his dancing more relevant to the cinema-going public</span>
				<span class='text'>As his first wife, actress and dancer [[Betsy Blair]] explained: &quot;A sailor suit or his white socks and loafers, or the T-shirts on his muscular torso, gave everyone the feeling that he was a regular guy, and perhaps they too could express love and joy by dancing in the street or stomping through puddles</span>

				<span class='text'>e democratized the dance in movies</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Blair, p</span>
				<span class='text'>76&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, he wanted to create a completely different image from that associated with Fred Astaire, not least because he believed his physique didn't suit such refined elegance: &quot;I used to envy his cool aristocratic style, so intimate and contained</span>
