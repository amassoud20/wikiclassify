				<span class='text'>The four members were Harry Webb (now going under the stage name &quot;Cliff Richard&quot;), [[Ian Samwell|Ian &quot;Sammy&quot; Samwell]] on guitar, Terry Smart on drums and Norman Mitham on guitar</span>
				<span class='text'>None of the other three played with the later and better known [[The Shadows|Shadows]], although Samwell wrote songs for Richard's later career</span>
				<span class='text'>or his debut session, [[Norrie Paramor]] provided Richard with &quot;Schoolboy Crush&quot;, a [[cover song|cover]] of an American record by [[Bobby Helms]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Richard was permitted to record one of his own songs for the [[B-side]]; this was &quot;[[Move It]]&quot;, written by the Drifters' Samwell on a number 715 [[Green Line Coaches|Green Line]] bus on the way to Richard's house for a rehearsal</span>
				<span class='text'>For the &quot;Move It&quot; session, Paramor used the session guitarist Ernie Shears on lead guitar and Frank Clark on bass</span>
				<span class='text'>here are various stories about why the A-side was replaced by the intended B-side</span>
				<span class='text'>One is that Norrie Paramor's young daughter raved about the B-side; another was that influential TV producer [[Jack Good (producer)|Jack Good]], who used the act &lt;!--another word needed for the act?--&gt;for his TV show ''[[Oh Boy!

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Richard himself stated that the latter theory is correct; interviewed for the first episode of the [[BBC Four]] programme, ''Pop Britannia'', broadcast on 4 January 2008</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Richard was quoted as saying –{{quote|It's wonderful to be going on TV for the first time, but I feel so nervous that I don't know what to do</span>

				<span class='text'>u |date=15 September 2012 |accessdate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;In the early days, Richard was marketed as the British equivalent of [[Elvis Presley]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Like previous British rockers such as [[Tommy Steele]] and [[Marty Wilde]], Richard adopted Presley-like dress and hairstyle</span>
				<span class='text'>In performance he struck a pose of rock attitude, rarely smiling or looking at the audience or camera</span>
				<span class='text'>His late 1958 and early 1959 follow-up singles, &quot;High Class Baby&quot; and &quot;Livin' Lovin' Doll&quot;, were followed by &quot;Mean Streak&quot;, which carried a rocker's sense of speed and passion, and [[Lionel Bart]]'s &quot;[[Living Doll (song)|Living Doll]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>t was on &quot;Living Doll&quot; that the Drifters began to back Richard on record</span>
				<span class='text'>It was his fifth record, and became his first No</span>
				<span class='text'>1 single</span>
				<span class='text'>By that time the group's line-up had changed with the arrival of [[Jet Harris]], [[Tony Meehan]], [[Hank Marvin]] and [[Bruce Welch]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The group was obliged to change its name to &quot;The Shadows&quot; after legal complications with the American group [[the Drifters]] as &quot;Living Doll&quot; entered the American top 40, licensed by [[ABC-Paramount]]</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Living Doll&quot; was used in Richard's début film ''[[Serious Charge]]'', but as a country standard, rather than a rock and roll standard</span>
				<span class='text'>he Shadows were not a typical backing group</span>
				<span class='text'>They became contractually separate from Richard, and the group received no royalties for records backing Richard</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1959, the Shadows (then still the Drifters) landed an [[EMI]] recording contract of their own, for independent recordings</span>
				<span class='text'>That year, they released three singles, two of which featured double-sided vocals and one of which had instrumental A and B sides</span>
				<span class='text'>They thereafter had several major hits, including five UK No</span>
				<span class='text'>1s</span>
				<span class='text'>The band also continued to appear and record with Richard and wrote many of his hits</span>
				<span class='text'>On more than one occasion, a Shadows' instrumental replaced a Richard song at the top of the British charts</span>
				<span class='text'>ichard's fifth single &quot;Living Doll&quot; triggered a softer, more relaxed, sound</span>
				<span class='text'>Subsequent hits, the No</span>
				<span class='text'>1s &quot;[[Travellin' Light]]&quot; and &quot;[[I Love You (Cliff Richard song)|I Love You]]&quot; and also &quot;A Voice in the Wilderness&quot; lifted from his film ''[[Expresso Bongo#1959 film|Expresso Bongo]]'' and &quot;Theme for a Dream&quot; cemented Richard's status as a mainstream pop entertainer along with contemporaries such as [[Adam Faith]] and [[Billy Fury]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Throughout the early 1960s, his hits were consistently in the top five</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1961, EMI records organised Richard's 21st birthday party at its London headquarters in Manchester Square led by his producer Norrie Paramor</span>
				<span class='text'>Photographs of the celebrations were incorporated into Richard's next album &quot;21 Today&quot; in which Tony Meehan joined in despite, then, having very recently left the Shadows to be replaced by Brian Bennett</span>
				<span class='text'>ypically, the Shadows closed the first half of the show with a 30-minute set of their own, then backed Richard on his show-closing 45-minute stint as exemplified by the retrospective CD album release of &quot;Live at the ABC Kingston 1962&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Tony Meehan and Jet Harris left the group in 1961 and 1962 respectively and later had their own chart successes for [[Decca Records|Decca]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Shadows added bass players [[Brian Locking]] (1962–63) and then [[John Rostill]] (1963–68) and took on [[Brian Bennett (musician)|Brian Bennett]] permanently on drums</span>
				<span class='text'>n the early days, particularly on EP and album releases, Richard sometimes recorded without the Shadows to cater to other styles with the Norrie Paramor Orchestra with Tony Meehan and then Brian Bennett as a session drummer</span>

				<span class='text'>It starred [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Hank Marvin]] and [[Una Stubbs]], and included ''A Song for Europe''</span>
				<span class='text'>He began 1970 by appearing live on the [[BBC]]'s review of the sixties music scene, ''[[Pop Go The Sixties]]'', which was broadcast across Britain and Europe on 31 December 1969</span>
				<span class='text'>He performed &quot;Bachelor Boy&quot; with the Shadows and &quot;Congratulations&quot; solo</span>
