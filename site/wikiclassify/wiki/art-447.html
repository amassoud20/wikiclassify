				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|Feynman (center) with [[Robert Oppenheimer]] (right) relaxing at a [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] social function during the [[Manhattan Project]]]]At Princeton, the physicist [[Robert R</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilson]] encouraged Feynman to participate in the [[Manhattan Project]]—the wartime [[United States Army|U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Army]] project at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] developing the [[atomic bomb]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Feynman said he was persuaded to join this effort to build it before [[Nazi Germany]] developed their own bomb</span>
				<span class='text'>He was assigned to [[Hans Bethe]]'s theoretical division and impressed Bethe enough to be made a group leader</span>
				<span class='text'>He and Bethe developed the [[Bethe–Feynman formula]] for calculating the yield of a [[Nuclear weapon design|fission bomb]], which built upon previous work by [[Robert Serber]]</span>
				<span class='text'>e immersed himself in work on the project, and was present at the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity]] bomb test</span>
				<span class='text'>Feynman claimed to be the only person to see the explosion without the very dark glasses or welder's lenses provided, reasoning that it was safe to look through a truck windshield, as it would screen out the harmful [[ultraviolet]] radiation</span>
				<span class='text'>On witnessing the blast, Feynman ducked towards the floor of his truck because of the immense brightness of the explosion, where he saw a temporary &quot;purple splotch&quot; [[afterimage]] of the event</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Feynman|1992|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;As a junior physicist, he was not central to the project</span>
				<span class='text'>The greater part of his work was administering the computation group of [[human computer]]s in the theoretical division (one of his students there, [[John G</span>
				<span class='text'>Kemeny]], later went on to co-design and co-specify the [[programming language]] [[BASIC]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Later, with [[Nicholas Metropolis]], he assisted in establishing the system for using [[IBM]] [[punched card]]s for computation</span>
				<span class='text'>eynman's other work at Los Alamos included calculating [[neutron]] equations for the Los Alamos &quot;Water Boiler&quot;, a small [[nuclear reactor]], to measure how close an assembly of fissile material was to criticality</span>
				<span class='text'>On completing this work he was transferred to the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory|Oak Ridge]] facility, where he aided engineers in devising safety procedures for material storage so that [[criticality accident]]s (for example, due to sub-critical amounts of fissile material inadvertently stored in proximity on opposite sides of a wall) could be avoided</span>
				<span class='text'>He also did theoretical work and calculations on the proposed [[uranium hydride bomb]], which later proved not to be feasible</span>
				<span class='text'>eynman was sought out by physicist [[Niels Bohr]] for one-on-one discussions</span>
				<span class='text'>He later discovered the reason: most of the other physicists were too much in awe of Bohr to argue with him</span>
				<span class='text'>Feynman had no such inhibitions, vigorously pointing out anything he considered to be flawed in Bohr's thinking</span>
				<span class='text'>Feynman said he felt as much respect for Bohr as anyone else, but once anyone got him talking about physics, he would become so focused he forgot about social niceties</span>
				<span class='text'>ue to the top secret nature of the work, [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] was isolated</span>
				<span class='text'>In Feynman's own words, &quot;There wasn't anything to ''do'' there</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Bored, he indulged his curiosity by learning to pick the combination locks on cabinets and desks used to secure papers</span>
				<span class='text'>Feynman played many jokes on colleagues</span>
				<span class='text'>In one case he found the combination to a locked filing cabinet by trying the numbers he thought a physicist would use (it proved to be 27–18–28 after the base of [[natural logarithm]]s, ''[[e (number)|e]]'' = 2</span>
				<span class='text'>1828</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>, and found that the three filing cabinets where a colleague kept a set of atomic bomb research notes all had the same combination</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Harvnb|Feynman|1985&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Feynman|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left a series of notes in the cabinets as a prank, which initially spooked his colleague, [[Frederic de Hoffmann]], into thinking a spy or saboteur had gained access to atomic bomb secrets</span>
				<span class='text'>On several occasions, Feynman drove to Albuquerque to see his ailing wife in a car borrowed from [[Klaus Fuchs]], who was later discovered to be a real spy for the Soviets, transporting nuclear secrets in his car to Santa Fe</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;!--These anecdotes are related by him in his book ''[[Surely You're Joking, Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Feynman!]]''--&gt;On occasion, Feynman would find an isolated section of the [[mesa]] where he could drum in the style of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American natives]]; &quot;and maybe I would dance and chant, a little&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>This did not go unnoticed, and rumors spread about a mysterious Indian drummer called &quot;Injun Joe&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He also became a friend of the laboratory head, [[Robert Oppenheimer|J</span>
				<span class='text'>Robert Oppenheimer]], who unsuccessfully tried to court him away from his other commitments after the war to work at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]</span>
				<span class='text'>eynman alludes to his thoughts on the justification for getting involved in the Manhattan project in ''[[The Pleasure of Finding Things Out]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>He felt the possibility of Nazi Germany developing the bomb before the Allies was a compelling reason to help with its development for the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>He goes on to say that it was an error on his part not to reconsider the situation once Germany was defeated</span>
				<span class='text'>In the same publication, Feynman also talks about his worries in the atomic bomb age, feeling for some considerable time that there was a high risk that the bomb would be used again soon, so that it was pointless to build for the future</span>
				<span class='text'>Later he describes this period as a &quot;depression&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>= Early academic career ==Following the completion of his PhD in 1942, Feynman held an appointment at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] as an assistant professor of physics</span>
				<span class='text'>The appointment was spent on leave for his involvement in the Manhattan project</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1945, he received a letter from Dean Mark Ingraham of the College of Letters and Science requesting his return to UW to teach in the coming academic year</span>
				<span class='text'>His appointment was not extended when he did not commit to return</span>
				<span class='text'>In a talk given several years later at [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|UW]], Feynman quipped, &quot;It's great to be back at the only university that ever had the good sense to fire me</span>

				<span class='text'>The theory for which Feynman won his Nobel Prize is known for its accurate [[prediction]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schwinger|1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory was begun in the earlier years during Feynman's work at Princeton as a graduate student and continued while he was at Cornell</span>
				<span class='text'>This work consisted of two distinct formulations</span>
				<span class='text'>The first is his [[path integral formulation]], and the second is the formulation of [[Feynman diagrams]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Both formulations contained his [[sum over histories]] method in which every possible path from one state to the next is considered, the final path being a sum over the possibilities (also referred to as [[sum-over-paths]])</span>

				<span class='text'>--&gt; For several years he lectured to students at Caltech on his path integral formulation of quantum theory</span>
				<span class='text'>The second formulation of quantum electrodynamics (using Feynman diagrams) was specifically mentioned by the Nobel committee</span>
				<span class='text'>The logical connection with the path integral formulation is interesting</span>
				<span class='text'>Feynman did not prove that the rules for his diagrams followed mathematically from the path integral formulation</span>
				<span class='text'>Some special cases were later proved by other people, but only in the real case, so the proofs do not work when spin is involved</span>
				<span class='text'>The second formulation should be thought of as starting anew, but guided by the intuitive insight provided by the first formulation</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Freeman Dyson]] published a paper in 1949, which added new rules to Feynman's that told how to implement [[renormalization]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Students everywhere learned and used the powerful new tool that Feynman had created</span>
				<span class='text'>Eventually computer programs were written to compute Feynman diagrams, providing a tool of unprecedented power</span>
				<span class='text'>It is possible to write such programs because the Feynman diagrams constitute a [[formal language]] with a [[Formal grammar|grammar]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Marc Kac]] provided the formal proofs of the summation under history, showing that the parabolic [[partial differential equation]] can be reexpressed as a sum under different histories (that is, an expectation operator), what is now known as the [[Feynman–Kac formula]], the use of which extends beyond physics to many applications of stochastic processes</span>

				<span class='text'>C</span>
				<span class='text'>George Sudarshan]] and [[Robert Marshak]] developed the theory nearly simultaneously, Feynman's collaboration with [[Murray Gell-Mann]] was seen as seminal because the [[weak interaction]] was neatly described by the vector and axial currents</span>
				<span class='text'>It thus combined the 1933 [[beta decay]] theory of [[Enrico Fermi]] with an explanation of [[Parity (physics)|parity]] violation</span>
				<span class='text'>e also developed [[Feynman diagram]]s, a bookkeeping device that helps in conceptualizing and calculating interactions between [[Elementary particle|particles]] in [[spacetime]], including the interactions between electrons and their [[antimatter]] counterparts, [[positron]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>This device allowed him, and later others, to approach time reversibility and other fundamental processes</span>
				<span class='text'>Feynman's mental picture for these diagrams started with the ''hard sphere'' approximation, and the interactions could be thought of as ''collisions'' at first</span>
				<span class='text'>It was not until decades later that physicists thought of analyzing the nodes of the Feynman diagrams more closely</span>
				<span class='text'>Feynman painted Feynman diagrams on the exterior of his van</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Harvnb|Feynman|2005&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sykes&quot; /&gt;From his diagrams of a small number of particles interacting in spacetime, Feynman could then [[model (abstract)|model]] all of physics in terms of the [[spin (physics)|spins]] of those particles and the range of coupling of the [[fundamental force]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Feynman|1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feynman attempted an explanation of the [[strong interaction]]s governing nucleons scattering called the [[Parton (particle physics)|parton]] model</span>
				<span class='text'>The parton model emerged as a complement to the [[quark]] model developed by his Caltech colleague [[Murray Gell-Mann]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The relationship between the two models was murky; Gell-Mann referred to Feynman's partons derisively as &quot;put-ons&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>In the mid-1960s, physicists believed that quarks were just a bookkeeping device for symmetry numbers, not real particles, as the statistics of the [[Omega-minus particle]], if it were interpreted as three identical strange quarks bound together, seemed impossible if quarks were real</span>
				<span class='text'>The Stanford linear accelerator [[deep inelastic scattering]] experiments of the late 1960s showed, analogously to [[Ernest Rutherford]]'s experiment of scattering alpha particles on gold nuclei in 1911, that [[nucleon]]s (protons and neutrons) contained point-like particles that scattered electrons</span>
				<span class='text'>It was natural to identify these with quarks, but Feynman's parton model attempted to interpret the experimental data in a way that did not introduce additional hypotheses</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, the data showed that some 45% of the energy momentum was carried by electrically-neutral particles in the nucleon</span>
				<span class='text'>These electrically-neutral particles are now seen to be the [[gluon]]s that carry the forces between the quarks and carry also the three-valued color quantum number that solves the Omega-minus problem</span>
				<span class='text'>Feynman did not dispute the quark model; for example, when the fifth quark was discovered in 1977, Feynman immediately pointed out to his students that the discovery implied the existence of a sixth quark, which was discovered in the decade after his death</span>
				<span class='text'>fter the success of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman turned to [[quantum gravity]]</span>
				<span class='text'>By analogy with the photon, which has spin 1, he investigated the consequences of a free massless spin 2 field, and derived the [[Einstein field equation]] of general relativity, but little more</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Feynman|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The computational device that Feynman discovered then for gravity, &quot;ghosts&quot;, which are &quot;particles&quot; in the interior of his diagrams that have the &quot;wrong&quot; connection between spin and statistics, have proved invaluable in explaining the quantum particle behavior of the [[Yang–Mills]] theories, for example, [[Quantum chromodynamics|QCD]] and the [[electro-weak]] theory</span>

				<span class='text'>Even though the books were not adopted by most universities as textbooks, they continue to sell well because they provide a deep understanding of physics</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of his lectures and miscellaneous talks were turned into other books, including ''The Character of Physical Law'', ''[[QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter]]'', ''Statistical Mechanics'', ''Lectures on Gravitation'', and the ''Feynman Lectures on Computation''</span>
				<span class='text'>eynman's students competed keenly for his attention; he was once awakened when a student solved a problem and dropped it in his mailbox; glimpsing the student sneaking across his lawn, he could not go back to sleep, and he read the student's solution</span>
				<span class='text'>The next morning his breakfast was interrupted by another triumphant student, but Feynman informed him that he was too late</span>
				<span class='text'>artly as a way to bring publicity to progress in physics, Feynman offered $1,000 prizes for two of his challenges in nanotechnology; one was claimed by [[William McLellan (nanotechnology)|William McLellan]] and the other by [[Tom Newman (scientist)|Tom Newman]]</span>

				<span class='text'>n 1974, Feynman delivered the Caltech commencement address on the topic of ''[[cargo cult science]]'', which has the semblance of science, but is only [[pseudoscience]] due to a lack of &quot;a kind of scientific integrity, a principle of scientific thought that corresponds to a kind of utter honesty&quot; on the part of the scientist</span>

				<span class='text'>eynman traveled to Brazil, where he gave courses at the BCPF (Brazilian Center for Physics Research) and near the end of his life schemed to visit the Russian land of [[Tuva]], a dream that, because of [[Cold War]] bureaucratic problems, never became reality</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Feynman|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;According to ''Genius'', the [[James Gleick]]-authored biography, Feynman tried [[LSD]] during his professorship at Caltech</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Gleick&quot; /&gt; Somewhat embarrassed by his actions, he largely sidestepped the issue when dictating his anecdotes; he mentions it in passing in the &quot;O Americano, Outra Vez&quot; section, while the &quot;Altered States&quot; chapter in ''[[Surely You're Joking, Mr</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Harvnb|Feynman|1985&quot; /&gt;In ''Surely You're Joking, Mr</span>

				<span class='text'>At Caltech, he used a nude or topless bar as an office away from his usual office, making sketches or writing physics equations on paper placemats</span>
				<span class='text'>When the county officials tried to close the place, all visitors except Feynman refused to testify in favor of the bar, fearing that their families or patrons would learn about their visits</span>
				<span class='text'>Only Feynman accepted, and in court, he affirmed that the bar was a public need, stating that craftsmen, technicians, engineers, common workers, &quot;and a physics professor&quot; frequented the establishment</span>
