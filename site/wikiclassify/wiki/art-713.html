				<span class='text'>During that autumn he moved to Rome where he took part in some experimental theatre shows, some of which he also directed</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1975, Benigni had his first theatrical success with ''Cioni Mario di Gaspare fu Giulia'', written by [[Giuseppe Bertolucci]]</span>
				<span class='text'>enigni became famous in Italy in the 1970s for a television series called ''Onda Libera'', on RAI2, produced by [[Renzo Arbore]], in which he interpreted the satirical piece ''The Hymn of the Body Purged'' (''L'inno del corpo sciolto'', a [[scatology|scatological]] song about the joys of [[defecation]])</span>

				<span class='text'>His first film was 1977's ''[[Berlinguer, I Love You]]'' (''Berlinguer ti voglio bene''), also by Bertolucci</span>
				<span class='text'>is popularity increased with ''[[L'altra domenica]]'' (1976/9), another TV show of Arbore's in which Benigni portrayed a lazy film critic who never watches the films he's asked to review</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Bernardo Bertolucci]] then cast him in a small speechless role as a window upholsterer in the film ''[[La Luna (1979 film)|La Luna]]'' which evaded American distribution due to its subject matter</span>
				<span class='text'>=1980s==In 1980 he met [[Cesena]]te actress [[Nicoletta Braschi]], who was to become his wife and who has starred in most of the films he has directed</span>
				<span class='text'>n June 1983 he appeared during a public political demonstration by the [[Italian Communist Party]], with which he was a sympathiser, and on this occasion he lifted and cradled the party's national leader [[Enrico Berlinguer]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It was an unprecedented act, given that until that moment Italian politicians were proverbially serious and formal</span>
				<span class='text'>Benigni was censored again in the 1980s for calling [[Pope John Paul II]] something impolite during an important live TV show (&quot;Wojtylaccio&quot;, meaning &quot;Bad Wojtyla&quot; in Italian, but with a friendly meaning in Tuscan dialect)</span>
				<span class='text'>enigni's first film as director was ''[[Tu mi turbi]]'' (''You Upset Me'') in [[1983 in film|1983]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This film was also his first collaboration with Braschi</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1984, he played in ''[[Non ci resta che piangere]]'' (&quot;Nothing Left to Do but Cry&quot;) with comic actor [[Massimo Troisi]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The story was a fable in which the protagonists are suddenly thrown back in time to the 15th century, just a little before 1492</span>
				<span class='text'>They start looking for [[Christopher Columbus]] in order to stop him from discovering the Americas (for very personal reasons), but are not able to reach him</span>
				<span class='text'>==Benigni in the United States and his collaboration with Cerami===Beginning in 1986, Benigni starred in three films by American director [[Jim Jarmusch]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''[[Down by Law (film)|Down By Law]]'' ([[1986 in film|1986]]) (which in Italy had its title spelled &quot;Daunbailò&quot;, in Italian phonetics) he played Bob, an innocent foreigner living in the United States, convicted of manslaughter, whose irrepressible good humour and optimism help him to escape and find love</span>
				<span class='text'>(The film also starred Braschi as his beloved</span>
				<span class='text'> In ''[[Night on Earth (film)|Night on Earth]]'', ([[1991 in film|1991]]) he played a cabbie in Rome, who causes his passenger, a priest, great discomfort and a heart attack by confessing his bizarre sexual experiences</span>
				<span class='text'>Later, he also starred in the first of Jarmusch's series of short films, ''[[Coffee and Cigarettes]]'' (2003)</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1990, he was a member of the Jury at the [[40th Berlin International Film Festival]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Benigni played [[Peter Sellers]]' Inspector Clouseau's illegitimate son who is assigned to save the Princess of Lugash</span>
				<span class='text'>The film bombed in the US, but was a hit in his homeland</span>
				<span class='text'>enigni had a rare serious role in [[Federico Fellini]]'s last film, ''[[La voce della luna]]'' (&quot;The Voice of the Moon&quot;) (1989)</span>
				<span class='text'>In earlier years Benigni had started a long-lasting collaboration with screenwriter [[Vincenzo Cerami]], for a series of films which scored great success in Italy: ''[[Il piccolo diavolo]]'' (&quot;The Little Devil&quot;) with [[Walter Matthau]], ''[[Johnny Stecchino]]'' (&quot;Johnny Toothpick&quot;), and ''[[The Monster (1994 film)|Il mostro]]'' (&quot;The Monster&quot;)</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Benigni and wife [[Nicoletta Braschi]] at the [[1998 Cannes Film Festival]]</span>
				<span class='text'>]Benigni is probably best known outside Italy for his [[1999 in film|1997]] [[tragicomedy]] ''[[Life Is Beautiful]]'' (''La vita è bella''), filmed in [[Arezzo]], also written by Cerami</span>
				<span class='text'>The film is about an Italian Jewish man who tries to protect his son's innocence during his internment at a [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[concentration camp]], by telling him that [[the Holocaust]] is an elaborate game and he must adhere very carefully to the rules to win</span>
				<span class='text'>Benigni's father had spent three years in a [[concentration camp]] in [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]],&lt;ref name=&quot;brinson&quot;&gt;Claudia Smith Brinson</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Live your life with exuberance, and happiness may come&quot; (editorial), ''[[The State (newspaper)|The State]]'' (Columbia, South Carolina), March 23, 1999, page A10</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and ''La vita è bella'' is based in part on his father's experiences</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the story and presentation of the film had been discussed during production with different Jewish groups to limit the offense it might cause, the film was attacked by critics who accused it of presenting the Holocaust without much suffering, and some who considered that &quot;laughing at everything&quot; was not appropriate</span>
				<span class='text'>More favourable critics praised Benigni's artistic daring and skill to create a sensitive comedy involving the tragedy, a challenge that [[Charlie Chaplin]] confessed he would not have done with ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' had he been aware of the horrors of the Holocaust</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1998, the film was nominated for seven [[Academy Award]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>At the [[71st Academy Awards|1999 ceremony]] Benigni received the award for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (the first for a male performer in a non-English-speaking role, and only the third overall acting Oscar for non-English-speaking roles), the score by [[Nicola Piovani]] won [[Academy Award for Best Music (Scoring)#1990s|Best Original Dramatic Score]], and the film was awarded the Oscar for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]], which Benigni accepted as the film's director</span>
				<span class='text'>amously, in the midst of being so giddy with delight after ''Life Is Beautiful'' was announced as the Best Foreign Film, Benigni climbed over and then stood on the backs of the seats in front of him and applauded the audience before proceeding to the stage</span>
				<span class='text'>And after winning his Best Actor Oscar later in the evening, he said in his acceptance speech, &quot;This is a terrible mistake because I used up all my English!&quot; As well, to close his speech, Benigni quoted the closing lines of Dante's ''Divine Comedy'', referencing &quot;the love that moves the sun and all the stars</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; At the [[72nd Academy Awards|following year's ceremony]], when he read the nominees for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (won by [[Hilary Swank]] for ''[[Boys Don't Cry (film)|Boys Don't Cry]]''), host [[Billy Crystal]] playfully appeared behind him with a large net to restrain Benigni if he got excessive with his antics again</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, on a 1999 episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', host [[Ray Romano]] played him in a sketch parodying his giddy behavior at the ceremony</span>
				<span class='text'>enigni played one of the main characters in ''[[Asterix and Obelix vs Caesar]]'' as Detritus, a corrupt Roman provincial governor who wants to kill Julius Caesar, thereby seizing control of the [[Roman Republic]]</span>

				<span class='text'>He was also named as the [[2002 Golden Raspberry Awards#Worst Actor|Worst Actor]] for his role as [[Pinocchio]], in the 23rd [[Golden Raspberry Awards]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The original Italian version was not so poorly greeted and received six nominations at the [[David di Donatello|David di Donatello Awards]], winning two, as well as winning one of the two awards it was nominated for at the Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists</span>

				<span class='text'>The film went on to win the prestigious Rockie Award for Best Arts Documentary at the [[Banff World Television Festival]] (2002) and the ''Coup de Coeur'' at the International Sunnyside of the Doc Marseille (2002)</span>

				<span class='text'>Prior to removing his shirt, Benigni had already hijacked the opening credits of the news program, jumping behind the newscaster and announcing: &quot;Berlusconi has resigned!&quot; (Benigni is an outspoken critic of media tycoon and then former Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]]</span>
				<span class='text'> The previous day, he had led a crowd of thousands in Rome on Friday in protest at the center-right government's decision to cut state arts funding by 35 percent</span>
