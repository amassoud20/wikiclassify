				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;1900]]'''Sir Edward William Elgar, 1st Baronet''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|OM|GCVO}} (2 June 1857 – 23 February 1934) was an English composer, many of whose works have entered the British and international [[classical music|classical]] concert repertoire</span>
				<span class='text'>Among his best-known compositions are orchestral works including the ''[[Enigma Variations]]'', the ''[[Pomp and Circumstance Marches]]'', concertos for [[Violin Concerto (Elgar)|violin]] and [[Cello Concerto (Elgar)|cello]], and two [[symphony|symphonies]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also composed choral works, including ''[[The Dream of Gerontius]]'', chamber music and songs</span>
				<span class='text'>He was appointed [[Master of the King's Musick]]&lt;!-- Note Musick is not a typo</span>
				<span class='text'>It was the correct spelling of the title until changed in 1975</span>
				<span class='text'>--&gt; in 1924</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough Elgar is often regarded as a typically English composer, most of his musical influences were not from England but from continental Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>He felt himself to be an outsider, not only musically, but socially</span>
				<span class='text'>In musical circles dominated by academics, he was a self-taught composer; in Protestant Britain, his [[Roman Catholic]]ism was regarded with suspicion in some quarters; and in the class-conscious society of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] Britain, he was acutely sensitive about his humble origins even after he achieved recognition</span>
				<span class='text'>He nevertheless married the daughter of a senior British army officer</span>
				<span class='text'>She inspired him both musically and socially, but he struggled to achieve success until his forties, when after a series of moderately successful works his ''Enigma Variations'' (1899) became immediately popular in Britain and overseas</span>
				<span class='text'>He followed the Variations with a choral work, ''The Dream of Gerontius'' (1900), based on a Roman Catholic text that caused some disquiet in the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] establishment in Britain, but it became, and has remained, a core repertory work in Britain and elsewhere</span>
				<span class='text'>His later full-length religious choral works were well received but have not entered the regular repertory</span>
				<span class='text'>n his fifties, Elgar composed a symphony and a violin concerto that were immensely successful</span>
				<span class='text'>His second symphony and his cello concerto did not gain immediate public popularity and took many years to achieve a regular place in the concert repertory of British orchestras</span>
				<span class='text'>Elgar's music came, in his later years, to be seen as appealing chiefly to British audiences</span>
				<span class='text'>His stock remained low for a generation after his death</span>
				<span class='text'>It began to revive significantly in the 1960s, helped by new recordings of his works</span>
				<span class='text'>Some of his works have, in recent years, been taken up again internationally, but the music continues to be played more in Britain than elsewhere</span>
				<span class='text'>lgar has been described as the first composer to take the [[Gramophone record|gramophone]] seriously</span>
				<span class='text'>Between 1914 and 1925, he conducted a series of [[acoustic recording]]s of his works</span>
				<span class='text'>The introduction of the [[microphone]] in 1925 made far more accurate sound reproduction possible, and Elgar made new recordings of most of his major orchestral works and excerpts from ''The Dream of Gerontius''</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=mt00/&gt; However, it was a disappointment to Elgar that on leaving school in 1872 he went not to Leipzig but to the office of a local solicitor as a clerk</span>

				<span class='text'>16&lt;/ref&gt; but Elgar himself, having heard leading virtuosi at London concerts, felt his own violin playing lacked a full enough tone, and he abandoned his ambitions to be a soloist</span>

				<span class='text'>In Elgar's [[chromaticism]], the influence of Wagner is apparent, but Elgar's individual style of orchestration owes much to the clarity of nineteenth-century French composers, Berlioz, [[Jules Massenet|Massenet]], Saint-Saëns and, particularly, [[Léo Delibes|Delibes]], whose music Elgar played and conducted at Worcester and greatly admired</span>

				<span class='text'>Diana McVeagh in ''Grove's Dictionary'' finds many embryonic Elgarian touches in these pieces, but few of them are regularly played, except ''[[Salut d'Amour]]'' and (as arranged decades later into ''[[The Wand of Youth]]'' Suites) some of the childhood sketches</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=grove/&gt; Elgar's sole work of note during his first spell in London in 1889–91, the overture ''[[Froissart Overture (Elgar)|Froissart]]'', was a romantic-bravura piece, influenced by [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]] and Wagner, but also showing further Elgarian characteristics</span>

				<span class='text'>These were ''The Black Knight'', ''King Olaf'', ''The Light of Life'', ''The Banner of St George'' and ''Caractacus''</span>
				<span class='text'>He also wrote a ''Te Deum'' and ''Benedictus'' for the Hereford Festival</span>
				<span class='text'>Of these, McVeagh comments favourably on his lavish orchestration and innovative use of [[leitmotif]]s, but less favourably on the qualities of his chosen texts and the patchiness of his inspiration</span>
				<span class='text'>McVeagh makes the point that, because these works of the 1890s were for many years little known (and performances remain rare), the mastery of his first great success, the ''[[Enigma Variations]]'', appeared to be a sudden transformation from mediocrity to genius, but in fact his orchestral skills had been building up throughout the decade</span>

				<span class='text'>''[[In the South (Alassio)]]'' (1903–1904), although designated by Elgar as a concert-overture, is, according to Kennedy, really a [[tone poem]] and the longest continuous piece of purely orchestral writing Elgar had essayed</span>

				<span class='text'>9&lt;/ref&gt; Hans Richter rated Elgar as &quot;the greatest modern composer&quot; in any country, and Richter's colleague Arthur Nikisch considered the First Symphony &quot;a masterpiece of the first order&quot; to be &quot;justly ranked with the great symphonic models – Beethoven and Brahms</span>

				<span class='text'>82&lt;/ref&gt; Elgar's immense popularity was not long-lived</span>
				<span class='text'>After the success of his First Symphony and Violin Concerto, his Second Symphony and Cello Concerto were politely received but without the earlier wild enthusiasm</span>
				<span class='text'>His music was identified in the public mind with the [[Edwardian era]], and after the First World War he no longer seemed a progressive or modern composer</span>

				<span class='text'>253–57&lt;/ref&gt;In 1924, the music scholar [[Edward Joseph Dent|Edward J</span>

				<span class='text'>450&lt;/ref&gt; In the later years of the century there was, in Britain at least, a revival of interest in Elgar's music</span>
				<span class='text'>The features that had offended austere taste in the inter-war years were seen from a different perspective</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1955, the reference book ''[[The Record Guide]]'' wrote of the Edwardian background during the height of Elgar's career:{{quote|Boastful self-confidence, emotional vulgarity, material extravagance, a ruthless philistinism expressed in tasteless architecture and every kind of expensive yet hideous accessory: such features of a late phase of Imperial England are faithfully reflected in Elgar's larger works and are apt to prove indigestible today</span>
				<span class='text'>But if it is difficult to overlook the bombastic, the sentimental, and the trivial elements in his music, the effort to do so should nevertheless be made, for the sake of the many inspired pages, the power and eloquence and lofty pathos, of Elgar's best work</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Anyone who doubts the fact of Elgar's genius should take the first opportunity of hearing ''The Dream of Gerontius'', which remains his masterpiece, as it is his largest and perhaps most deeply felt work; the symphonic study, ''Falstaff''; the Introduction and Allegro for Strings; the ''Enigma Variations''; and the Violoncello Concerto</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=esw/&gt;}}By the 1960s, a less severe view was being taken of the Edwardian era</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1966 the critic [[Frank Howes]] wrote that Elgar reflected the last blaze of opulence, expansiveness and full-blooded life, before World War I swept so much away</span>
				<span class='text'>In Howes's view, there was a touch of vulgarity in both the era and Elgar's music, but &quot;a composer is entitled to be judged by posterity for his best work</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Elgar is historically important for giving to English music a sense of the orchestra, for expressing what it felt like to be alive in the Edwardian age, for conferring on the world at least four unqualified masterpieces, and for thereby restoring England to the comity of musical nations</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=howes/&gt;[[File:Sibelius-strauss-RVW-stravinsky</span>

				<span class='text'>Cox noted that Elgar disliked folk-songs and never used them in his works, opting for an idiom that was essentially German, leavened by a lightness derived from French composers including Berlioz and Gounod</span>
				<span class='text'>How then, asked Cox, could Elgar be &quot;the most English of composers&quot;? Cox found the answer in Elgar's own personality, which &quot;could use the alien idioms in such a way as to make of them a vital form of expression that was his and his alone</span>
				<span class='text'>And the personality that comes through in the music is English</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=cox/&gt; This point about Elgar's transmuting his influences had been touched on before</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1930 ''The Times'' wrote, &quot;When Elgar's first symphony came out, someone attempted to prove that its main tune on which all depends was like the Grail theme in Parsifal</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>but the attempt fell flat because everyone else, including those who disliked the tune, had instantly recognized it as typically 'Elgarian', while the Grail theme is as typically Wagnerian</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=sympo/&gt; In the same year, Roger Fiske wrote in ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|The Gramophone]]'', &quot;For some reason few people seem to like the two Elgar symphonies equally; each has its champions and often they are more than a little bored by the rival work</span>

				<span class='text'>9&lt;/ref&gt; The critic [[John Warrack]] wrote, &quot;There are no sadder pages in symphonic literature than the close of the First Symphony's Adagio, as horn and trombones twice softly intone a phrase of utter grief&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Warrack, John, &quot;Three English Masters&quot;, ''Gramophone'', March 1984, p</span>
				<span class='text'>21&lt;/ref&gt; whereas to Michael Kennedy, the movement is notable for its lack of anguished yearning and ''angst'' and is marked instead by a &quot;benevolent tranquillity</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (1970), p</span>
				<span class='text'>56&lt;/ref&gt;Despite the fluctuating critical assessment of the various works over the years, Elgar's major works taken as a whole have in the twenty-first century recovered strongly from their neglect in the 1950s</span>
				<span class='text'>''The Record Guide'' in 1955 could list only one currently available recording of the First Symphony, none of the Second, one of the Violin Concerto, two of the Cello Concerto, two of the ''Enigma Variations'', one of ''Falstaff'', and none of ''The Dream of Gerontius''</span>
				<span class='text'>Since then there have been multiple recordings of all the major works</span>
				<span class='text'>More than thirty recordings have been made of the First Symphony since 1955, for example, and more than a dozen of ''The Dream of Gerontius''</span>
