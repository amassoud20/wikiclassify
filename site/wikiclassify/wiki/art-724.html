				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Denier of Charles the Bald struck at Paris]]'''Charles the Bald''' (13 June 823 – 6 October 877) was the King of [[West Francia]] (843–77), [[King of Italy]] (875–77) and [[Holy Roman Emperor]] (875–77, as '''Charles&amp;nbsp;II''')</span>
				<span class='text'>After a series of civil wars that began during the reign of his father, [[Louis the Pious]], Charles succeeded by the [[Treaty of Verdun]] (843) in acquiring the western third of the [[Carolingian Empire]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a grandson of [[Charlemagne]] and the youngest son of Louis the Pious by his second wife, [[Judith, daughter of Welf|Judith]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Struggle against his brothers==He was born on 13 June 823 in [[Frankfurt]],{{sfn|Riche|1983|p=150}} when his elder brothers were already adults and had been assigned their own ''regna'', or subkingdoms, by their father</span>
				<span class='text'>The attempts made by Louis the Pious to assign Charles a subkingdom, first [[Alemannia]] and then the country between the [[Meuse]] and the [[Pyrenees]] (in 832, after the rising of [[Pepin I of Aquitaine]]) were unsuccessful</span>
				<span class='text'>The numerous reconciliations with the rebellious [[Lothair I|Lothair]] and Pepin, as well as their brother [[Louis the German]], [[List of rulers of Bavaria|King of Bavaria]], made Charles's share in [[Aquitaine]] and Italy only temporary, but his father did not give up and made Charles the heir of the entire land which was once Gaul and would eventually be France</span>
				<span class='text'>At a [[Diet (assembly)|diet]] in [[Aachen]] in 837, Louis the Pious bade the nobles do homage to Charles as his heir</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Riche|1983|p=157}} Pepin of Aquitaine died in 838, whereupon Charles at last received that kingdom,{{sfn|Riche|1983|p=157}} which angered Pepin's heirs and the Aquitainian nobles</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Riche|1983|p=158}}The death of the emperor in 840 led to the outbreak of war between his sons</span>
				<span class='text'>Charles allied himself with his brother Louis the German to resist the pretensions of the new emperor Lothair I, and the two allies defeated Lothair at the [[Battle of Fontenoy-en-Puisaye]] on 25 June 841</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bradbury|2007|p=14}} In the following year, the two brothers confirmed their alliance by the celebrated [[Oath of Strasbourg|Oaths of Strasbourg]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The war was brought to an end by the [[Treaty of Verdun]] in August 843</span>
				<span class='text'>The settlement gave Charles the Bald the kingdom of the West Franks, which he had been up until then governing and which practically corresponded with what is now France, as far as the [[Meuse]], the [[Saône]], and the [[Rhône]], with the addition of the [[Marches#Catalonia and the </span>
				<span class='text'>2Spanish Marches</span>
				<span class='text'>2|Spanish March]] as far as the [[Ebro]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis received the eastern part of the [[Carolingian Empire]], known then as [[East Francia]] and later as Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>Lothair retained the imperial title and the [[Kingdom of Italy (medieval)|Kingdom of Italy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also received the central regions from [[Flanders]] through the [[Rhineland]] and [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] as king of [[Middle Francia]]</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|265px|[[French_denier|Denier]] (type Temple and cross) of Charles the Bald, minted at [[Reims]] between 840-864 (pre-[[Edict of Pistres]])</span>
				<span class='text'>][[File:Karel2Holy</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|upright|Seal of Charles the Bald]]The first years of Charles's reign, up to the death of Lothair I in 855, were comparatively peaceful</span>
				<span class='text'>During these years the three brothers continued the system of &quot;confraternal government&quot;, meeting repeatedly with one another, at [[Koblenz]] (848), at [[Meerssen]] (851), and at [[Attigny, Ardennes|Attigny]] (854)</span>
				<span class='text'>In 858, Louis the German, invited by disaffected nobles eager to oust Charles, invaded the West Frankish kingdom</span>
				<span class='text'>Charles was so unpopular that he was unable to summon an army, and he fled to [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was saved only by the support of the bishops, who refused to crown Louis the German king, and by the fidelity of the [[Elder Welfs|Welfs]], who were related to his mother, Judith</span>
				<span class='text'>In 860, he in his turn tried to seize the kingdom of his nephew, [[Charles of Provence]], but was repulsed</span>
				<span class='text'>On the death of his nephew [[Lothair II]] in 869, Charles tried to seize Lothair's dominions, but by the [[Treaty of Mersen]] (870) was compelled to share them with Louis the German</span>
				<span class='text'>esides these family disputes, Charles had to struggle against repeated rebellions in Aquitaine and against the [[Brittany|Bretons]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Led by their chiefs [[Nominoe, Duke of Brittany|Nomenoë]] and [[Erispoe, Duke of Brittany|Erispoë]], who defeated the king at the [[Battle of Ballon]] (845) and the [[Battle of Jengland]] (851), the Bretons were successful in obtaining a ''de facto'' independence</span>
				<span class='text'>Charles also fought against the [[Vikings]], who devastated the country of the north, the valleys of the [[Seine]] and [[Loire]], and even up to the borders of Aquitaine</span>
				<span class='text'>Several times Charles was forced to purchase their retreat at a heavy price</span>
				<span class='text'>Charles led various expeditions against the invaders and, by the [[Edict of Pistres]] of 864, made the army more mobile by providing for a [[cavalry]] element, the predecessor of the French [[chivalry]] so famous during the next 600 years</span>
				<span class='text'>By the same edict, he ordered fortified bridges to be put up at all rivers to block the Viking incursions</span>
				<span class='text'>Two of these bridges at Paris saved the city during its [[Siege of Paris (885-886)|siege of 885–886]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Reign as emperor==[[File:Apparition Charles le chauve</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|Apparition of Charles the Bald after his death and burial in Saint Denis]]In 875, after the death of the Emperor [[Louis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis II]] (son of his half-brother Lothair), Charles the Bald, supported by [[Pope John VIII]], traveled to Italy, receiving the royal crown at [[Pavia]] and the imperial insignia in Rome on 29 December</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis the German, also a candidate for the succession of Louis II, revenged himself by invading and devastating Charles' dominions, and Charles had to return hastily to [[West Francia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After the death of Louis the German (28 August 876), Charles in his turn attempted to seize Louis's kingdom, but was decisively beaten at [[Andernach]] on 8 October 876</span>
				<span class='text'>n the meantime, John VIII, menaced by the [[Saracens]], was urging Charles to come to his defence in Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>Charles again crossed the [[Alps]], but this expedition was received with little enthusiasm by the nobles, and even by his regent in [[Lombardy]], [[Boso of Provence|Boso]], and they refused to join his army</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time [[Carloman of Bavaria|Carloman]], son of Louis the German, entered northern Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>Charles, ill and in great distress, started on his way back to Gaul, but died while crossing the pass of [[Mont Cenis]] at [[Brides-les-Bains]], on 6 October 877</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Riche|1983|p=204}}According to the Annals of St-Bertin, Charles was hastily buried at the abbey of Nantua, Burgundy because the bearers were unable to withstand the stench of his decaying body</span>
				<span class='text'>He was to have been buried in the [[Basilique Saint-Denis]] and may have been transferred there later</span>
				<span class='text'>It was recorded that there was a memorial brass there that was melted down at the Revolution</span>
				<span class='text'>harles was succeeded by his son, [[Louis the Stammerer|Louis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Charles was a prince of education and letters, a friend of the church, and conscious of the support he could find in the episcopate against his unruly nobles, for he chose his councillors from among the higher clergy, as in the case of [[Guenelon of Sens]], who betrayed him, and of [[Hincmar of Reims]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Baldness==It has been suggested that Charles' nickname was used ironically and not descriptively; i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>that he was not in fact bald, but rather that he was extremely hairy</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Nelson|1992|p=13}} In support of this idea is the fact that none of his enemies commented on what would be an easy target</span>
				<span class='text'>However, none of the voluble members of his court comments on his being hairy; and the ''Genealogy of Frankish Kings'', a text from Fontanelle dating from possibly as early as 869, and a text without a trace of irony, names him as ''Karolus Caluus'' (&quot;Charles the Bald&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>Certainly, by the end of the 10th century, [[Richier of Reims]] and [[Adhemar of Chabannes]] refer to him in all seriousness as &quot;Charles the Bald&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Dutton|2008}}An alternative or additional interpretation is based on Charles' initial lack of a ''[[Monarchy|regnum]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Bald&quot; would in this case be a tongue-in-cheek reference to his landlessness, at an age where his brothers already had been sub-kings for some years</span>
