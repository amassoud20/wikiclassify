				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|upright|Moctezuma II, from ''Historia de la conquista de México'' by [[Antonio de Solís y Ribadeneyra|Antonio de Solis]]]]The firsthand account of [[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]]'s ''[[Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España|True History of the Conquest of New Spain]]'' paints a portrait of a noble leader who struggles to maintain order in his kingdom after he is taken prisoner by [[Hernán Cortés]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In his first description of Moctezuma, Díaz del Castillo writes:&quot;The Great Montezuma was about forty years old, of good height, well proportioned, spare and slight, and not very dark, though of the usual Indian complexion</span>
				<span class='text'>He did not wear his hair long but just over his ears, and he had a short black beard, well-shaped and thin</span>
				<span class='text'>His face was rather long and cheerful, he had fine eyes, and in his appearance and manner could express geniality or, when necessary, a serious composure</span>
				<span class='text'>He was very neat and clean, and took a bath every afternoon</span>
				<span class='text'>He had many women as his mistresses, the daughters of chieftains, but two legitimate wives who were [[Cacique]]s&lt;ref group=&quot;N</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&gt;''[[Cacique]]'' is a hispanicized word of Caribbean origins, meaning &quot;hereditary lord/chief&quot; or &quot;(military) leader&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>After first encountering the term and office in the Caribbean, conquest-era writers such as Díaz often used it to describe indigenous rulers generally</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; in their own right, and only some of his servants knew of it</span>
				<span class='text'>He was quite free from sodomy</span>
				<span class='text'>The clothes he wore one day he did not wear again till three or four days later</span>
				<span class='text'>He had a guard of two hundred chieftains lodged in rooms beside his own, only some of whom were permitted to speak to him</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; (Díaz del Castillo 1568/1963: 224–25)When Moctezuma was allegedly killed by being stoned to death by his own people &quot;Cortés and all of us captains and soldiers wept for him, and there was no one among us that knew him and had dealings with him who did not mourn him as if he were our father, which was not surprising, since he was so good</span>
				<span class='text'>It was stated that he had reigned for seventeen years, and was the best king they ever had in Mexico, and that he had personally triumphed in three wars against countries he had subjugated</span>
				<span class='text'>I have spoken of the sorrow we all felt when we saw that Montezuma was dead</span>
				<span class='text'>We even blamed the [[Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy|Mercederian]] friar for not having persuaded him to become a Christian</span>

				<span class='text'>Historian [[James Lockhart]] suggests that the people needed to have a scapegoat for the Aztec defeat, and Moctezuma naturally fell into that role</span>

				<span class='text'>Pagden has written that &quot;There is no preconquest tradition which places [[Quetzalcoatl]] in this role, and it seems possible therefore that it was elaborated by [[Bernardino de Sahagún|Sahagún]] and [[Motolinía]] from informants who themselves had partially lost contact with their traditional tribal histories&quot; (Pagden 1986:467)===Fernando Alvarado Tezozómoc===[[Fernando Alvarado Tezozómoc]], who wrote the [[Crónica Mexicayotl]], was a grandson of Moctezuma II and his chronicle mostly relates the genealogy of the Aztec rulers</span>
				<span class='text'>He describes Moctezuma's issue and counts that Moctezuma had nineteen children – eleven sons and eight daughters</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|right|frame|Moctezuma's Palace from the ''[[Codex Mendoza]]'' (1542)]]Some of the Aztec stories about Moctezuma describe him as being fearful of the Spanish newcomers, and some sources, such as the [[Florentine Codex]], comment that the Aztecs believed the Spaniards to be gods and Cortés to be the returned god [[Quetzalcoatl]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The veracity of this claim is difficult to ascertain, though some recent ethnohistorians specialising in early Spanish/Nahua relations have discarded it as post-conquest mythicalisation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Restall 2003, chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;Much of the idea of Cortés being seen as a deity can be traced back to the Florentine Codex, written some 50 years after the conquest</span>
				<span class='text'>In the codex's description of the first meeting between Moctezuma and Cortés, the Aztec ruler is described as giving a prepared speech in classical oratorial Nahuatl, a speech which as described verbatim in the codex (written by Sahagún's Tlatelolcan informants) included such prostrate declarations of divine or near-divine admiration as, &quot;You have graciously come on earth, you have graciously approached your water, your high place of Mexico, you have come down to your mat, your throne, which I have briefly kept for you, I who used to keep it for you,&quot; and, &quot;You have graciously arrived, you have known pain, you have known weariness, now come on earth, take your rest, enter into your palace, rest your limbs; may our lords come on earth</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; While some historians such as [[Warren H</span>
				<span class='text'>Carroll]] consider this as evidence that Moctezuma was at least open to the possibility that the Spaniards were divinely sent based on the [[Quetzalcoatl]] legend, others such as Matthew Restall argue that Moctezuma politely offering his throne to Cortés (if indeed he did ever give the speech as reported) may well have been meant as the exactly opposite of what it was taken to mean, as politeness in Aztec culture was a way to assert dominance and show superiority</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Restall, 2003, p</span>
				<span class='text'>97&lt;/ref&gt; Other parties have also propagated the idea that the Native Americans believed the conquistadors to be gods, most notably the historians of the [[Franciscan]] order such as [[Friar|Fray]] [[Gerónimo de Mendieta]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Martínez 1980&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bernardino de Sahagún]], who compiled the Florentine Codex, was also a Franciscan priest</span>
				<span class='text'>==Indigenous accounts of omens and Moctezuma's beliefs===[[Bernardino de Sahagún]] (1499–1590) includes in Book 12 of the [[Florentine Codex]] eight events said to have occurred prior to the arrival of the Spanish</span>
				<span class='text'>These were purportedly interpreted as signs of a possible disaster, e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>a comet, the burning of a temple, a crying ghostly woman, and others</span>
				<span class='text'>Some speculate that the Aztecs were particularly susceptible to such ideas of doom and disaster because the particular year in which the Spanish arrived coincided with a &quot;tying of years&quot; ceremony at the end of a 52-year cycle in the Aztec calendar, which in Aztec belief was linked to changes, rebirth and dangerous events</span>
				<span class='text'>The belief of the Aztecs being rendered passive by their own superstition is referred to by Matthew Restall as part of &quot;The Myth of Native Desolation&quot; to which he dedicates chapter 6 in his book [[Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Restall, 2003, chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt; These legends are likely a part of the post-conquest rationalization by the Aztecs of their defeat, and serve to show Moctezuma as indecisive, vain, and superstitious, and ultimately the cause of the fall of the Aztec Empire</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Lockhart 1993, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>17–19&quot; /&gt;Ethnohistorian [[Susan Gillespie]] has argued that the Nahua understanding of history as repeating itself in cycles also led to a subsequent rationalization of the events of the conquests</span>
				<span class='text'>In this interpretation the description of Moctezuma, the final ruler of the Aztec Empire prior to the Spanish conquest, was tailored to fit the role of earlier rulers of ending dynasties—for example Quetzalcoatl, the mythical last ruler of the [[Toltec]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gillespie, 1989, Chapter 5</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In any case it is within the realm of possibility that the description of Moctezuma in post-conquest sources was colored by his role as a monumental closing figure of Aztec history</span>

				<span class='text'>As the Spaniards approached Tenochtitlan they made an alliance with the [[Tlaxcaltec]]a, who were enemies of the Aztec Triple Alliance, and they helped instigate revolt in many towns under Aztec dominion</span>
