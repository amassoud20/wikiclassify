				<span class='text'>His birth took place during the violence that surrounded the suppression of the [[Paris Commune]], and his childhood corresponded with the consolidation of the [[French Third Republic]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Much of ''[[In Search of Lost Time]]'' concerns the vast changes, most particularly the decline of the aristocracy and the rise of the middle classes that occurred in France during the Third Republic and the ''[[fin de siècle]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Proust spent long holidays in the village of [[Illiers-Combray|Illiers]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This village, combined with recollections of his great-uncle's house in Auteuil, became the model for the fictional town of Combray, where some of the most important scenes of ''In Search of Lost Time'' take place</span>
				<span class='text'>(Illiers was renamed Illiers-Combray in 1971 on the occasion of the Proust centenary celebrations</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1882, at the age of eleven, Proust became a pupil at the [[Lycée Condorcet]], but his education was disrupted by his illness</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite this he excelled in literature, receiving an award in his final year</span>
				<span class='text'>Thanks to his classmates, he was able to gain access to some of the salons of the upper bourgeoisie, providing him with copious material for ''[[In Search of Lost Time]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>1894</span>
				<span class='text'>]Despite his poor health, Proust served a year (1889–90) enlisted in the French army, stationed at Coligny Barracks in [[Orléans]], an experience that provided a lengthy episode in ''[[The Guermantes' Way]]'', part three of his novel</span>
				<span class='text'>As a young man, Proust was a dilettante and a [[social climber]] whose aspirations as a writer were hampered by his lack of self-discipline</span>
				<span class='text'>His reputation from this period, as a snob and an amateur, contributed to his later troubles with getting ''[[Swann's Way]]'', the first part of his large-scale novel, published in 1913</span>
				<span class='text'>At this time, he attended the ''salons'' of [[Geneviève Halévy|Mme Straus]], widow of [[Georges Bizet]] and mother of Proust's childhood friend Jacques Bizet, of [[Madeleine Lemaire]] and of [[Léontine Lippmann|Mme Arman de Caillavet]], one of the models for Madame Verdurin, and mother of his friend [[Gaston Arman de Caillavet]], with whose fiancée (Jeanne Pouquet) he was in love</span>
				<span class='text'>It is through Mme Arman de Caillavet that he made the acquaintance of [[Anatole France]], her lover</span>
				<span class='text'>n an 1892 article published in ''Le Banquet'' entitled &quot;L'Irréligion d'État&quot; and again in a 1904 ''[[Le Figaro]]'' article entitled &quot;La mort des cathédrales&quot;, Proust argued against the [[separation of church and state]], declaring that socialism posed a greater threat to society than the Church and emphasizing the latter's role in sustaining a cultural and educational tradition</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hughes|first=Edward J</span>
				<span class='text'>title=Proust, Class, and Nation|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=36–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;Proust had a close relationship with his mother</span>
				<span class='text'>To appease his father, who insisted that he pursue a career, Proust obtained a volunteer position at [[Bibliothèque Mazarine]] in the summer of 1896</span>
				<span class='text'>After exerting considerable effort, he obtained a sick leave that extended for several years until he was considered to have resigned</span>
				<span class='text'>He never worked at his job, and he did not move from his parents' apartment until after both were dead</span>

				<span class='text'>ODO:someone add page numbers etc&lt;/ref&gt;His life and family circle changed markedly between 1900 and 1905</span>
				<span class='text'>In February 1903, Proust's brother, {{ill|fr|Robert Proust}}, married and left the family home</span>
				<span class='text'>His father died in November of the same year</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Carter (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, and most crushingly, Proust's beloved mother died in September 1905</span>
				<span class='text'>She left him a considerable inheritance</span>
				<span class='text'>His health throughout this period continued to deteriorate</span>
				<span class='text'>roust spent the last three years of his life mostly confined to his bedroom, sleeping during the day and working at night to complete his novel</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He died of [[pneumonia]] and a [[Lung abscess|pulmonary abscess]] in 1922</span>
				<span class='text'>He was buried in the [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris</span>
				<span class='text'>=Early writing=={{French literature sidebar}}Proust was involved in writing and publishing from an early age</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition to the literary magazines with which he was associated, and in which he published, while at school, ''La Revue verte'' and ''La Revue lilas'', from 1890 to 1891 Proust published a regular society column in the journal ''Le Mensuel''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Tadié&quot;/&gt; In 1892 he was involved in founding a literary review called ''Le Banquet'' (also the French title of [[Plato]]'s ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]''), and throughout the next several years Proust published small pieces regularly in this journal and in the prestigious ''La Revue Blanche''</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1896 ''Les Plaisirs et les Jours'', a compendium of many of these early pieces, was published</span>
				<span class='text'>The book included a foreword by  [[Anatole France]], drawings by madame [[Madeleine Lemaire|Lemaire]] in the ''salon'' of whom Proust would be a frequent guest, and who was a model for Mme Verdurin</span>
				<span class='text'>She invited him and [[Reynaldo Hahn]] in her [[château de Réveillon]] (the model for Mme Verdurin's La Raspelière) in summer 1894 and three weeks in 1895</span>
				<span class='text'>This book was so sumptuously produced that it cost twice the normal price of a book its size</span>
				<span class='text'>hat year Proust also began working on a novel, which was eventually published in 1952 and titled ''[[Jean Santeuil]]'' by his posthumous editors</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of the themes later developed in ''In Search of Lost Time'' find their first articulation in this unfinished work, including the enigma of memory and the necessity of reflection; several sections of ''In Search of Lost Time'' can be read in the first draft in ''Jean Santeuil''</span>
				<span class='text'>The portrait of the parents in ''Jean Santeuil'' is quite harsh, in marked contrast to the adoration with which the parents are painted in Proust's masterpiece</span>
				<span class='text'>Following the poor reception of ''Les Plaisirs et les Jours'', and internal troubles with resolving the plot, Proust gradually abandoned ''Jean Santeuil'' in 1897 and stopped work on it entirely by 1899</span>
				<span class='text'>eginning in 1895 Proust spent several years reading [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]], and [[John Ruskin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Through this reading Proust began to refine his own theories of art and the role of the artist in society</span>
				<span class='text'>Also, in ''[[Le Temps retrouvé|Time Regained]]'' Proust's universal protagonist recalls having translated Ruskin's ''Sesame and Lilies''</span>
				<span class='text'>The artist's responsibility is to confront the appearance of nature, deduce its essence and retell or explain that essence in the work of art</span>
				<span class='text'>Ruskin's view of artistic production was central to this conception, and Ruskin's work was so important to Proust that he claimed to know &quot;by heart&quot; several of Ruskin's books, including ''The Seven Lamps of Architecture'', ''The Bible of Amiens'', and ''Praeterita''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tadié; p</span>
				<span class='text'>350&lt;/ref&gt;Proust set out to translate two of Ruskin's works into French, but was hampered by an imperfect command of English</span>
				<span class='text'>To compensate for this he made his translations a group affair: sketched out by his mother, the drafts were first revised by Proust, then by Marie Nordlinger, the English cousin of his friend and sometime lover{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}[[Reynaldo Hahn]], then again finally polished by Proust</span>
				<span class='text'>Confronted about his method by an editor, Proust responded, &quot;I don't claim to know English; I claim to know Ruskin&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tadié; p</span>
				<span class='text'>326&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karlin, Daniel (2005) ''Proust's English''; p</span>
				<span class='text'>36&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Bible of Amiens'', with Proust's extended introduction, was published in French in 1904</span>
				<span class='text'>Both the translation and the introduction were very well reviewed; [[Henri Bergson]] called Proust's introduction &quot;an important contribution to the psychology of Ruskin&quot; and had similar praise for the translation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Tadié&quot;&gt;Tadié; p</span>
				<span class='text'>433&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of this publication, Proust was already at work on translating Ruskin's ''Sesame and Lilies'', which he completed in June 1905, just before his mother's death, and published in 1906</span>
				<span class='text'>Literary historians and critics have ascertained that, apart from Ruskin, Proust's chief literary influences included [[Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]], [[Montaigne]], [[Stendhal]], [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]], [[George Eliot]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], and [[Leo Tolstoy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>908 was an important year for Proust's development as a writer</span>
				<span class='text'>During the first part of the year he published in various journals [[pastiches]] of other writers</span>
				<span class='text'>These exercises in imitation may have allowed Proust to solidify his own style</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, in the spring and summer of the year Proust began work on several different fragments of writing that would later coalesce under the working title of ''Contre Sainte-Beuve''</span>
				<span class='text'>Proust described what he was working on in a letter to a friend: &quot;I have in progress: a study on the nobility, a Parisian novel, an essay on [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve|Sainte-Beuve]] and [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]], an essay on women, an essay on pederasty (not easy to publish), a study on stained-glass windows, a study on tombstones, a study on the novel&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Tadié&quot;&gt;Tadié; p</span>
				<span class='text'>513&lt;/ref&gt;From these disparate fragments Proust began to shape a novel on which he worked continually during this period</span>
				<span class='text'>The rough outline of the work centered on a first-person narrator, unable to sleep, who during the night remembers waiting as a child for his mother to come to him in the morning</span>
				<span class='text'>The novel was to have ended with a critical examination of Sainte-Beuve and a refutation of his theory that biography was the most important tool for understanding an artist's work</span>
				<span class='text'>Present in the unfinished manuscript notebooks are many elements that correspond to parts of the ''Recherche'', in particular, to the &quot;Combray&quot; and &quot;Swann in Love&quot; sections of Volume 1, and to the final section of Volume 7</span>
				<span class='text'>Trouble with finding a publisher, as well as a gradually changing conception of his novel, led Proust to shift work to a substantially different project that still contained many of the same themes and elements</span>
				<span class='text'>By 1910 he was at work on ''À la recherche du temps perdu''</span>
				<span class='text'>=''In Search of Lost Time''=={{Main|In Search of Lost Time}}Begun in 1909, ''À la recherche du temps perdu'' consists of seven volumes totaling around 3,200 pages (about 4,300 in The Modern Library's translation) and featuring more than 2,000 characters</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Graham Greene (writer)|Graham Greene]] called Proust the &quot;greatest novelist of the 20th century&quot;,{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} and [[W</span>
				<span class='text'>Somerset Maugham]] called the novel the &quot;greatest fiction to date&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Proust died before he was able to complete his revision of the drafts and proofs of the final volumes, the last three of which were published posthumously and edited by his brother, Robert</span>
				<span class='text'>he book was translated into English by [[C</span>
				<span class='text'>K</span>
				<span class='text'>Scott Moncrieff]], appearing under the title ''Remembrance of Things Past'' between 1922 and 1931</span>
				<span class='text'>Scott Moncrieff translated volumes one through six of the seven volumes, dying before completing the last</span>
				<span class='text'>This last volume was rendered by other translators at different times</span>
				<span class='text'>When Scott Moncrieff's translation was later revised (first by [[Terence Kilmartin]], then by [[D</span>
				<span class='text'>J</span>
				<span class='text'>Enright]]) the title of the novel was changed to the more literal ''In Search of Lost Time''</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1995 Penguin undertook a fresh translation of the book by editor Christopher Prendergast and seven translators in three countries, based on the latest, most complete and authoritative French text</span>
				<span class='text'>Its six volumes, comprising Proust's seven, were published in Britain under the Allen Lane imprint in 2002</span>
				<span class='text'>=Personal life==Proust was homosexual, and his sexuality and relationships with men are often discussed by his biographers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Painter (1959), White (1998), Tadié (2000), Carter (2002 and 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Although his housekeeper, Céleste Albaret, denies this aspect of Proust's sexuality in her memoirs,&lt;ref&gt;Albaret (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; her denial runs contrary to the statements of many of Proust's friends and contemporaries, including fellow writer [[André Gide]],&lt;ref&gt;Harris (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as his valet Ernest A</span>
				<span class='text'>Forssgren</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Forssgren (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;During his life Proust never openly admitted to his homosexuality, though his family and close friends either knew or suspected it</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1897 he even fought a duel with writer [[Jean Lorrain]], who publicly questioned the nature of Proust's relationship with Lucien Daudet</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite Proust's own public denial, his romantic relationship with composer [[Reynaldo Hahn]], and his infatuation with his chauffeur and secretary Alfred Agostinelli are well documented</span>
				<span class='text'>The exact influence of Proust's sexuality on his writing is a topic of debate</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Sedgwick (1992) and O'Brien (1949)&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''In Search of Lost Time'' discusses homosexuality at length and features several principal characters, both men and women, who are either homosexual or bisexual: the Baron de Charlus, Robert de Saint-Loup, and Albertine Simonet</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Sedgwick (1992), Ladenson (1999), and Bersani (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Homosexuality also appears as a theme in ''Les plaisirs et les jours'' and his unfinished novel, ''Jean Santeuil''</span>
