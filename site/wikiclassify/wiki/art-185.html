				<span class='text'>t an early age, Francis was attracted to science and what he could learn about it from books</span>
				<span class='text'>As a child, he was taken to church by his parents</span>
				<span class='text'>But by about age 12, he said he did not want to go anymore, as he preferred a scientific search for answers over religious belief</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Walter Crick, his uncle, lived in a small house on the south side of Abington Avenue; he had a shed at the bottom of his little garden where he taught Crick to blow glass, do chemical experiments and to make photographic prints</span>
				<span class='text'>When he was eight or nine he transferred to the most junior form of the [[Northampton Grammar School]], on the Billing Road</span>
				<span class='text'>This was about 1 1/4 miles from his home so he could walk there and back, by Park Avenue South and Abington Park Crescent, but he more often went by bus or, later, by bicycle</span>
				<span class='text'>The teacher – a Miss Holding – was an inspired teacher and made everything interesting</span>
				<span class='text'>The teaching in the higher forms was satisfactory, but not as stimulating</span>
				<span class='text'>After the age of 14, he was educated at [[Mill Hill School]] in London (on scholarship), where he studied [[mathematics]], [[physics]], and [[chemistry]] with his best friend John Shilston</span>
				<span class='text'>He shared the Walter Knox Prize for Chemistry on Mill Hill School's Foundation Day, Friday, 7 July 1933</span>
				<span class='text'>He declared that his success was inspired by the quality of teaching he received whilst a pupil at Mill Hill</span>

				<span class='text'>Crick began his PhD at [[University College London|UCL]] but was interrupted by WWII</span>

				<span class='text'>This migration was made possible by the newly won influence of physicists such as [[John Randall (physicist)|Sir John Randall]], who had helped win the war with inventions such as ``: [[radar]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Crick had to adjust from the &quot;elegance and deep simplicity&quot; of physics to the &quot;elaborate chemical mechanisms that natural selection had evolved over billions of years</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He described this transition as, &quot;almost as if one had to be born again</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; According to Crick, the experience of learning physics had taught him something important—hubris—and the conviction that since physics was already a success, great advances should also be possible in other sciences such as biology</span>
				<span class='text'>Crick felt that this attitude encouraged him to be more daring than typical biologists who tended to concern themselves with the daunting problems of biology and not the past successes of physics</span>
				<span class='text'>or the better part of two years, Crick worked on the physical properties of [[cytoplasm]] at Cambridge's [[Strangeways Research Laboratory]], headed by [[Honor Bridget Fell]], with a [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] studentship, until he joined [[Max Perutz]] and [[John Kendrew]] at the Cavendish Laboratory</span>
				<span class='text'>The Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge was under the general direction of [[William Lawrence Bragg|Sir Lawrence Bragg]], who had won the [[Nobel Prize]] in 1915 at the age of 25</span>
				<span class='text'>Bragg was influential in the effort to beat a leading American chemist, [[Linus Pauling]], to the discovery of [[DNA]]'s structure (after having been pipped at the post by Pauling's success in determining the alpha helix structure of proteins)</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time Bragg's Cavendish Laboratory was also effectively competing with [[King's College London]], whose Biophysics department was under the direction of [[John Randall (physicist)|Sir John Randall]]</span>
				<span class='text'>(Randall had refused Crick's application to work at King's College</span>
				<span class='text'> Francis Crick and [[Maurice Wilkins]] of King's College were personal friends, which influenced subsequent scientific events as much as the close friendship between Crick and James Watson</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;CrickWMPTalking&quot;/&gt; A key piece of experimentally-derived information came from X-ray diffraction images that had been obtained by [[Maurice Wilkins]], [[Rosalind Franklin]], and their research student, Raymond Gosling</span>

				<span class='text'>[[Alex Stokes|Alexander Stokes]] (another expert in helical diffraction theory) and Wilkins (both at King's College) had reached the conclusion that X-ray diffraction data for DNA indicated that the molecule had a helical structure—but Franklin vehemently disputed this conclusion</span>

				<span class='text'>Crick was writing his Ph</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>thesis; Watson also had other work such as trying to obtain crystals of [[myoglobin]] for X-ray diffraction experiments</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1952, Watson performed X-ray diffraction on [[tobacco mosaic virus]] and found results indicating that it had helical structure</span>
				<span class='text'>Having failed once, Watson and Crick were now somewhat reluctant to try again and for a while they were forbidden to make further efforts to find a molecular model of DNA</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:DNA Structure</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|Diagram that emphasizes the phosphate backbone of DNA</span>
				<span class='text'>Watson and Crick first made helical models with the phosphates at the center of the helices</span>
				<span class='text'>]Of great importance to the model building effort of Watson and Crick was [[Rosalind Franklin]]'s understanding of basic chemistry, which indicated that the [[hydrophilic]] [[phosphate]]-containing backbones of the [[nucleotide]] chains of DNA should be positioned so as to interact with [[water (molecule)|water molecules]] on the outside of the molecule while the [[hydrophobic]] bases should be packed into the core</span>
				<span class='text'>Franklin shared this chemical knowledge with Watson and Crick when she pointed out to them that their first model (from 1951, with the phosphates inside) was obviously wrong</span>
				<span class='text'>rick described what he saw as the failure of [[Maurice Wilkins]] and [[Rosalind Franklin]] to cooperate and work towards finding a molecular model of DNA as a major reason why he and Watson eventually made a second attempt to do so</span>
				<span class='text'>They asked for, and received, permission to do so from both [[William Lawrence Bragg]] and Wilkins</span>
				<span class='text'>In order to construct their model of DNA, Watson and Crick made use of information from unpublished X-ray diffraction images of Franklin's (shown at meetings and freely shared by Wilkins), including preliminary accounts of Franklin's results/photographs of the X-ray images that were included in a written progress report for the King's College laboratory of [[John Randall (physicist)|Sir John Randall]] from late 1952</span>
				<span class='text'>t is a matter of debate whether Watson and Crick should have had access to Franklin's results without her knowledge or permission, and before she had a chance to [[academic publishing|formally publish]] the results of her detailed analysis of her X-ray diffraction data which were included in the progress report</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Watson and Crick found fault in her steadfast assertion that, according to her data, a helical structure was not the only possible shape for DNA—so they had a dilemma</span>
				<span class='text'>In an effort to clarify this issue, [[Max Ferdinand Perutz]] later published what had been in the progress report,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Perutz MF, Randall JT, Thomson L, Wilkins MH, Watson JD |title=DNA helix |journal=Science |volume=164 |issue=3887 |pages=1537–9 |date=June 1969 |pmid=5796048 |doi=10</span>

				<span class='text'>Further, Perutz explained that the report was to a [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] (MRC) committee that had been created in order to &quot;establish contact between the different groups of people working for the Council&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Randall's and Perutz's laboratories were both funded by the MRC</span>
				<span class='text'>t is also not clear how important Franklin's unpublished results from the progress report actually were for the model-building done by Watson and Crick</span>
				<span class='text'>After the first crude X-ray diffraction images of DNA were collected in the 1930s, [[William Astbury]] had talked about stacks of nucleotides spaced at 3</span>

				<span class='text'>Thus, the Watson and Crick model was not the first &quot;bases in&quot; model to be proposed</span>
				<span class='text'>Furberg's results had also provided the correct orientation of the DNA sugars with respect to the bases</span>
				<span class='text'>During their model building, Crick and Watson learned that an [[antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]] orientation of the two nucleotide chain backbones worked best to orient the [[base pair]]s in the centre of a double helix</span>
				<span class='text'>Crick's access to Franklin's progress report of late 1952 is what made Crick confident that DNA was a double helix with antiparallel chains, but there were other chains of reasoning and sources of information that also led to these conclusions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;JudsonCh3modeling&quot;&gt;In chapter 3 of ''The Eighth Day of Creation'', [[Horace Freeland Judson|Horace Judson]] describes the development of [[James Watson|Watson]]'s and Crick's thinking about the structure of DNA and how it evolved during their model building</span>
				<span class='text'>Watson and Crick were open to the idea of tentatively ignoring all individual experimental results, in case they might be wrong or misleading</span>
				<span class='text'>Judson describes how Watson spent a large amount of time ''ignoring'' Crick's belief (based on Franklin's determination of the space group) that the two backbone strands were antiparallel</span>
				<span class='text'>On page 176, Judson quotes a letter written by Watson, &quot;The model has been derived almost entirely from stereochemical considerations with the only X-ray consideration being the spacing between the pair of bases 3</span>
				<span class='text'> A which was originally found by Astbury</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt;As a result of leaving King's College for [[Birkbeck College]], Franklin was asked by John Randall to give up her work on DNA</span>
				<span class='text'>When it became clear to Wilkins and the supervisors of Watson and Crick that Franklin was going to the new job, and that [[Linus Pauling]] was working on the structure of DNA, they were willing to share Franklin's data with Watson and Crick, in the hope that they could find a good model of DNA before Pauling was able</span>
				<span class='text'>Franklin's X-ray diffraction data for DNA and her systematic analysis of DNA's structural features was useful to Watson and Crick in guiding them towards a correct molecular model</span>
				<span class='text'>The key problem for Watson and Crick, which could not be resolved by the data from King's College, was to guess how the nucleotide bases pack into the core of the DNA double helix</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:DNA chemical structure</span>
				<span class='text'>vg|thumb|right|Diagrammatic representation of some key structural features of DNA</span>
				<span class='text'>The similar structures of [[guanine]]:[[cytosine]] and [[adenine]]:[[thymine]] base pairs is illustrated</span>
				<span class='text'>The base pairs are held together by [[hydrogen bond]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>The phosphate backbones are [[antiparallel (biochemistry)|anti-parallel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>]Another key to finding the correct structure of DNA was the so-called [[Chargaff's rules|Chargaff ratios]], experimentally determined ratios of the nucleotide subunits of DNA: the amount of [[guanine]] is equal to [[cytosine]] and the amount of [[adenine]] is equal to [[thymine]]</span>
				<span class='text'>A visit by [[Erwin Chargaff]] to England in 1952 reinforced the salience of this important fact for Watson and Crick</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Personal communication: Conversation between Francis Crick and Kim Booth, August 1980&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of these ratios for the structure of DNA were not recognized until Watson, persisting in building structural models, realized that A:T and C:G pairs are structurally similar</span>
				<span class='text'>In particular, the length of each base pair is the same</span>
				<span class='text'>Chargaff had also pointed out to Watson that, in the aqueous, saline environment of the cell, the predominant tautomers of the pyrimidine (C and T) bases would be the amine and keto configurations of cytosine and thymine, rather than the imino and enol forms that Crick and Watson had assumed</span>
				<span class='text'>They consulted [[Jerry Donohue]] who confirmed the most likely structures of the nucleotide bases</span>

				<span class='text'>T</span>
				<span class='text'>Astbury that described his early X-ray diffraction results for DNA</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The base pairs are held together by [[hydrogen bond]]s, the same non-covalent interaction that stabilize the protein α-helix</span>
				<span class='text'> The correct structures were essential for the positioning of the hydrogen bonds</span>
				<span class='text'> These insights led Watson to deduce the true biological relationships of the A:T and C:G pairs</span>
				<span class='text'>After the discovery of the hydrogen bonded A:T and C:G pairs, Watson and Crick soon had their anti-parallel, double helical model of DNA, with the hydrogen bonds at the core of the helix providing a way to &quot;unzip&quot; the two complementary strands for easy [[DNA replication|replication]]: the last key requirement for a likely model of the genetic molecule</span>
				<span class='text'>As important as Crick's contributions to the discovery of the double helical DNA model were, he stated that without the chance to collaborate with Watson, he would not have found the structure by himself</span>

				<span class='text'>75: &quot;If Jim had been killed by a tennis ball, I am reasonably sure I would not have solved the structure alone&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Crick did tentatively attempt to perform some experiments on nucleotide base pairing, but he was more of a theoretical biologist than an experimental biologist</span>
				<span class='text'>There was another near-discovery of the base pairing rules in early 1952</span>
				<span class='text'>Crick had started to think about interactions between the bases</span>
				<span class='text'>He asked John Griffith to try to calculate attractive interactions between the DNA bases from chemical principles and [[quantum mechanics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Griffith's best guess was that A:T and G:C were attractive pairs</span>
				<span class='text'>At that time, Crick was not aware of Chargaff's rules and he made little of Griffith's calculations, although it did start him thinking about complementary replication</span>
				<span class='text'>Identification of the correct base-pairing rules (A-T, G-C) was achieved by Watson &quot;playing&quot; with cardboard cut-out models of the nucleotide bases, much in the manner that Linus Pauling had discovered the protein alpha helix a few years earlier</span>
				<span class='text'>The Watson and Crick discovery of the DNA double helix structure was made possible by their willingness to combine theory, modeling and experimental results (albeit mostly done by others) to achieve their goal</span>
				<span class='text'>he DNA double helix structure proposed by Watson and Crick was based upon &quot;Watson-Crick&quot; bonds between the four bases most frequently found in DNA (A, C, T, G) and RNA (A, C, U, G)</span>
				<span class='text'>However, later research showed that triple-stranded, quadruple-stranded and other more complex DNA molecular structures required [[Hoogsteen base pair]]ing</span>
				<span class='text'>The entire field of [[synthetic biology]] began with work by researchers such as [[Erik T</span>
				<span class='text'>Kool]], in which bases other than A, C, T and G are used in a synthetic DNA</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition to synthetic DNA there are also attempts to construct synthetic [[codons]], synthetic [[endonucleases]], synthetic proteins and synthetic [[zinc fingers]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Using synthetic DNA, instead of there being 4&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; codons, if there are n new bases there could be as many as n&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; codons</span>

				<span class='text'>In his thinking about the biological processes linking DNA genes to proteins, Crick made explicit the distinction between the materials involved, the energy required, and the information flow</span>
				<span class='text'>Crick was focused on this third component (information) and it became the organizing principle of what became known as [[molecular biology]]</span>

				<span class='text'>ccording to the [[University of Cambridge]]'s genetics department official website, the electors of the professorship could not reach consensus, prompting the intervention of then University [[Vice-Chancellor]] [[Edgar Adrian, 1st Baron Adrian|Lord Adrian]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Lord Adrian first offered the professorship to a compromise candidate, [[Guido Pontecorvo]], who refused, and is said to have offered it then to Crick, who also refused</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1976, Crick took a [[sabbatical|sabbatical year]] at the [[Salk Institute for Biological Studies]] in [[La Jolla, California]]</span>

				<span class='text'>He was also a professor at the [[University of California, San Diego]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He taught himself [[neuroanatomy]] and studied many other areas of [[neuroscience]] research</span>
				<span class='text'>It took him several years to disengage from molecular biology because exciting discoveries continued to be made, including the discovery of [[alternative splicing]] and the discovery of [[restriction enzyme]]s, which helped make possible [[genetic engineering]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Eventually, in the 1980s, Crick was able to devote his full attention to his other interest, [[consciousness]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His [[autobiography|autobiographical]] book, ''[[What Mad Pursuit: A Personal View of Scientific Discovery]]'', includes a description of why he left molecular biology and switched to neuroscience</span>
				<span class='text'>pon taking up work in theoretical neuroscience, Crick was struck by several things:*there were many isolated subdisciplines within neuroscience with little contact between them*many people who were interested in behaviour treated the brain as a [[black box (systems)|black box]]*consciousness was viewed as a [[taboo]] subject by many [[neurobiologist]]sCrick hoped he might aid progress in neuroscience by promoting constructive interactions between specialists from the many different subdisciplines concerned with consciousness</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1983, as a result of their studies of computer models of neural networks, Crick and Mitchison proposed that the function of [[REM sleep]] is to remove certain modes of interactions in networks of cells in the mammalian cerebral cortex; they called this hypothetical process '[[reverse learning]]' or 'unlearning'</span>
				<span class='text'>In the final phase of his career, Crick established a collaboration with [[Christof Koch]] that lead to publication of a series of articles on consciousness during the period spanning from 1990&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[https://profiles</span>

				<span class='text'>Crick made the strategic decision to focus his theoretical investigation of consciousness on how the brain generates visual [[awareness]] within a few hundred milliseconds of viewing a scene</span>
				<span class='text'>Crick and Koch proposed that consciousness seems so mysterious because it involves very short-term [[memory]] processes that are as yet poorly understood</span>
				<span class='text'>Crick also published a book describing how [[neurobiology]] had reached a mature enough stage so that consciousness could be the subject of a unified effort to study it at the molecular, cellular and behavioural levels</span>
				<span class='text'>Crick's book ''[[The Astonishing Hypothesis]]'' made the argument that neuroscience now had the tools required to begin a scientific study of how [[Human brain|brain]]s produce conscious experiences</span>
				<span class='text'>Crick was skeptical about the value of [[Connectionism|computational models]] of mental function that are not based on details about brain structure and function</span>
				<span class='text'>=Reactions==Crick was often described as very talkative, with Watson – in ''The Double Helix'' – implying lack of modesty</span>

				<span class='text'>quot; '' and on the base: ''&quot;The double helix model was supported by the work of Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;''*Another sculpture entitled ''Discovery'', by artist Lucy Glendinning was installed on Tuesday, 13 December 2005 in Abington Street, Northampton</span>
				<span class='text'>According to the late Lynn Wilson, chairman of the Wilson Foundation, &quot;The sculpture celebrates the life of a world class scientist who must surely be considered the greatest Northamptonian of all time&amp;nbsp;— by discovering DNA he unlocked the whole future of genetics and the alphabet of life</span>
