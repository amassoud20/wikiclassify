				<span class='text'>'' (October 6, 1846 â€“ March 12, 1914) was an [[United States of America|American]] [[entrepreneur]] and [[engineer]] who invented the [[railway air brake]] and was a pioneer of the [[electrical industry]], gaining his first patent at the age of 22</span>
				<span class='text'>Based in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]] for much of his career, Westinghouse was one of [[Thomas Edison]]'s main rivals in the early implementation of the American electricity system</span>
				<span class='text'>Westinghouse's [[electricity distribution system]], based on [[alternating current]], ultimately prevailed over Edison's insistence on [[direct current]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1911 Westinghouse received the [[American Institute of Electrical Engineers|AIEE's]] [[Edison Medal]] &quot;For meritorious achievement in connection with the development of the [[alternating current]] system</span>

				<span class='text'>At the age of fifteen, as the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] broke out, Westinghouse enlisted in the [[New York National Guard]] and served until his parents urged him to return home</span>
				<span class='text'>In April 1863 he persuaded his parents to allow him to re-enlist, whereupon he joined Company M of the 16th New York Cavalry and earned promotion to the rank of corporal</span>
				<span class='text'>In December 1864 he resigned from the Army to join the [[United States Navy|Navy]], serving as Acting Third Assistant Engineer on the ''[[USS Muscoota]]'' through the end of the war</span>
				<span class='text'>After his military discharge in August 1865, he returned to his family in [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]] and enrolled at [[Union College]]</span>
				<span class='text'>However, he lost interest in the curriculum and dropped out in his first term there</span>

				<span class='text'>Brakemen had to run from car to car, on catwalks atop the cars, applying the brakes manually on each car</span>

				<span class='text'>ng|thumb|Westinghouse Steam and Air Brakes ({{US patent|144006}})]]In 1869, at age 22, Westinghouse invented a railroad braking system using compressed air</span>
				<span class='text'>The Westinghouse system used a compressor on the locomotive, a reservoir and a special valve on each car, and a single pipe running the length of the train (with flexible connections) which both refilled the reservoirs and controlled the brakes, allowing the engineer to apply and release the brakes simultaneously on all cars</span>
				<span class='text'>It is a failsafe system, in that any rupture or disconnection in the train pipe will apply the brakes throughout the train</span>
				<span class='text'>It was patented by Westinghouse on October 28, 1873</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The [[Westinghouse Air Brake Company]] (WABCO) was subsequently organized to manufacture and sell Westinghouse's invention</span>
				<span class='text'>It was in time nearly universally adopted by railways</span>
				<span class='text'>Modern trains use brakes in various forms based on this design</span>
				<span class='text'>The same conceptual design of fail-safe air brake is also found on heavy trucks</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|Westinghouse Electric Company 1888 catalog advertising their &quot;Alternating System&quot;]]In 1879 [[Thomas Edison]] invented an improved [[incandescent light bulb]], and realized the need for an electrical distribution system to provide power for lighting</span>
				<span class='text'>On September 4, 1882, Edison switched on the world's first [[electric power]] distribution system, providing 110 [[volt]]s [[direct current]] (DC) to 59 customers in lower [[Manhattan]], around his [[Pearl Street Station]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The main drawback with Edison's low-voltage DC power network was its short transmission range, with centralized plants only able to supply customers within a mile of each plant</span>
				<span class='text'>estinghouse's interests in gas distribution and telephone switching &lt;!--Has not been discussed --&gt; led him to become interested in electrical power distribution</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1884 he started developing his own DC lighting system and hired [[physicist]] [[William Stanley (physicist)|William Stanley]] to work on it</span>
				<span class='text'>Westinghouse became aware of the new European AC systems in 1885 when he read about them in the UK technical journal ''Engineering''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Richard Moran, Executioner's Current: Thomas Edison, George Westinghouse, and the Invention of the Electric Chair, Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group - 2007, page 42&lt;/ref&gt; An AC [[power system]] allowed voltages to be &quot;stepped up&quot; by a [[transformer]] for distribution long distances without the severe power losses suffered by DC systems, and then &quot;stepped down&quot; by a transformer for consumer use</span>
				<span class='text'>With AC's potential to achieve greater [[economies of scale]] with large centralized power plants, and its ability to supply electricity long distance in cities with more disperse populations, Westinghouse saw a way to build a truly competitive system instead of simply building another barely competitive DC lighting system using patents just different enough to get around the Edison patents</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tesla: Inventor of the Electrical Age by W</span>
				<span class='text'>Bernard Carlson Princeton University Press - 2013, page 89&lt;/ref&gt; The Edison DC system of centralized DC plants with short transmission range also meant that there was a patchwork of un-supplied customers between Edison's plants that Westinghouse could easily supply with AC power</span>

				<span class='text'>The voltage was stepped up to 3,000 volts for transmission, and then stepped back down to 100 volts to drive electric lights</span>

				<span class='text'>Edison mentioned to colleagues at the end of 1886 that Westinghouse would &quot;''kill a customer within six months''&quot; with his new AC system and first spoke out (privately) in a late 1887 letter to a New York State committee trying to determine a new, more humane system of execution to replace hanging, say the best method would be to wire the prisoner to a Westinghouse AC generator</span>
				<span class='text'>In February 1888 Edison began a public media campaign claiming that high voltage AC systems were inherently dangerous</span>
				<span class='text'>Westinghouse responded that the risks could be managed and were outweighed by the benefits</span>
				<span class='text'>Edison tried to have legislation enacted in several states to limit power transmission voltages to 800 volts, but failed</span>
				<span class='text'>estinghouse also had to deal with an AC rival, the [[Thomson-Houston Electric Company]]</span>
				<span class='text'>They had built 22 power stations by the end of 1887&lt;ref name=&quot;Le9FfXlAC 2011, page 50&quot;/&gt; and by 1889 had bought out a third AC competitor, the [[Brush Electric Company]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Thomson-Houston was expanding their business while trying to avoid patent conflicts with Westinghouse, arranging deals such as coming to agreements over lighting company territory, paying a royalty to use the Stanley transformer patent, and allowing Westinghouse to use their [[William E</span>
				<span class='text'>Sawyer|Sawyer-Man]] incandescent bulb patent</span>
				<span class='text'>fter a young New York City boy was killed from accidentally touching a fallen telegraph wire that had been energized with alternating current, an electrical consultant named [[Harold P</span>
				<span class='text'>Brown]] sent a June 5, 1888 letter to the editor of the ''New York Evening Post''</span>
				<span class='text'>The letter claimed that alternating current was inherently dangerous and asked why the &quot;''public must submit to constant danger from sudden death''&quot; just so utilities could use a cheaper AC system</span>
				<span class='text'>Within a few days, Brown was lobbying in the newspapers for server regulations on AC power</span>

				<span class='text'>A year later he founded what is now the ghost town of [[Duquesne, Arizona|Duquesne]] to use as his company headquarters</span>

				<span class='text'>At the outset, the available generating sources were hydroturbines where falling water was available, and reciprocating [[steam engine]]s where it was not</span>
				<span class='text'>Westinghouse felt that reciprocating steam engines were clumsy and inefficient, and wanted to develop some class of &quot;rotating&quot; engine that would be more elegant and efficient</span>
				<span class='text'>ne of his first inventions had been a rotary steam engine, but it had proven impractical</span>
				<span class='text'>The British engineer [[Charles Algernon Parsons]] began experimenting with [[steam turbine]]s in 1884, beginning with a 10-horsepower (7</span>
				<span class='text'>&amp;nbsp;kW) </span>
				<span class='text'>Westinghouse bought rights to the Parsons turbine in 1885, and improved the Parsons technology and increased its scale</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>], from 1901 to 1914]]In 1898 Westinghouse demonstrated a 300 kilowatt unit, replacing reciprocating engines in his air-brake factory</span>
				<span class='text'>The next year he installed a 1</span>
				<span class='text'> megawatt, 1,200 rpm unit for the [[Hartford Electric Light Company]]</span>
				<span class='text'>estinghouse then developed steam turbines for maritime propulsion</span>
				<span class='text'>Large turbines were most efficient at about 3,000 rpm, while an efficient propeller operated at about 100 rpm</span>
				<span class='text'>That required reduction gearing, but building reduction gearing that could operate at high rpm and at high power was difficult, since a slight misalignment would shake the power train to pieces</span>
				<span class='text'>Westinghouse and his engineers devised an automatic alignment system that made turbine power practical for large vessels</span>
				<span class='text'>estinghouse remained productive and inventive almost all his life</span>
				<span class='text'>Like Edison, he had a practical and experimental streak</span>
				<span class='text'>At one time, Westinghouse began to work on [[heat pump]]s that could provide heating and cooling, and believed that he might be able to extract enough power in the process for the system to run itself</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=October 2012}}Any modern engineer would clearly see that Westinghouse was after a [[perpetual motion machine]], and the British physicist [[Lord Kelvin]], one of Westinghouse's correspondents, told him that he would be violating the laws of [[thermodynamics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Westinghouse replied that might be the case, but it made no difference</span>
				<span class='text'>If he couldn't build a perpetual-motion machine, he would still have a heat pump system that he could patent and sell</span>
				<span class='text'>ith the introduction of the [[automobile]] after the turn of the century, Westinghouse went back to earlier inventions and devised a compressed air [[shock absorber]] for automobile suspensions</span>
				<span class='text'>estinghouse remained a captain of American industry until 1907, when a financial panic led to his resignation from control of the Westinghouse company</span>
				<span class='text'>By 1911, he was no longer active in business, and his health was in decline</span>
				<span class='text'>eorge Westinghouse died on March 12, 1914, in New York City, at age 67</span>
				<span class='text'>He was initially interred in Woodlawn Cemetery, Bronx, NY then removed on December 14, 1915</span>
				<span class='text'> As a Civil War veteran, he was buried in [[Arlington National Cemetery]], along with his wife Marguerite, who survived him by three months</span>
				<span class='text'>She had also initially interred in Woodlawn and removed and reinterred at the same time as George</span>
				<span class='text'>Although a shrewd and determined businessman, Westinghouse was a conscientious employer and wanted to make fair deals with his business associates</span>
