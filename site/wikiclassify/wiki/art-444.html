				<span class='text'>Prior to his presidency, he served as the 33rd [[Governor of California]] from 1967 to 1975, following a career as an actor and union leader in Hollywood</span>
				<span class='text'>aised in a poor family in small towns of Northern Illinois, Ronald Reagan graduated from [[Eureka College]] in 1932 and worked as a sports announcer on several regional radio stations</span>
				<span class='text'>After moving to Hollywood in 1937, he became an actor and starred in a few major productions</span>
				<span class='text'>Reagan was twice elected as President of the [[Screen Actors Guild]], the labor union for actors, where he worked to root out [[House Un-American Activities Committee|Communist influence]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In the 1950s, he moved into television and was a motivational speaker at [[General Electric]] factories</span>

				<span class='text'>In [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964]], Reagan's speech, &quot;[[A Time for Choosing]]&quot;, in support of [[Barry Goldwater]]'s floundering presidential campaign, earned him national attention as a new conservative spokesman</span>
				<span class='text'>Building a network of supporters, he [[California gubernatorial election, 1966|was elected Governor of California in 1966]]</span>
				<span class='text'>As governor, Reagan raised taxes, turned a state budget deficit to a surplus, challenged the protesters at the University of California, ordered National Guard troops in during a period of [[People's Park (Berkeley)|protest movements]] in 1969, and was [[California gubernatorial election, 1970|re-elected in 1970]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He twice ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nominations in [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968]] and [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976]]; four years later, he easily won the nomination outright, going on to be elected the oldest President, defeating incumbent [[Jimmy Carter]] in [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ntering the presidency in [[First inauguration of Ronald Reagan|1981]], Reagan implemented sweeping new political and economic initiatives</span>
				<span class='text'>His [[Supply-side economics|supply-side economic]] policies, dubbed &quot;[[Reaganomics]]&quot;, advocated tax rate reduction to spur economic growth, control of the money supply to curb inflation, economic deregulation, and reduction in government spending</span>
				<span class='text'>In his first term he survived [[Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan|an assassination attempt]], escalated the [[War on Drugs]], and fought [[Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (1968)|public-sector labor]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Over his two terms, his economic policies saw a reduction of inflation from 12</span>
				<span class='text'>% to 4</span>
				<span class='text'>%, and an average annual growth of [[Gross domestic product|real GDP]] of 3</span>
				<span class='text'>4%; while Reagan did enact cuts in domestic discretionary spending, increased military spending contributed to increased federal outlays overall, even after adjustment for inflation</span>
				<span class='text'>During his reelection bid, Reagan campaigned on the notion that it was &quot;[[Morning in America]]&quot;, winning a [[United States presidential election, 1984|landslide in 1984]] with the largest electoral college victory in history</span>
				<span class='text'>Foreign affairs dominated his second term, including ending of the [[Cold War]], the [[1986 bombing of Libya|bombing of Libya]], and the [[Iran–Contra affair]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Publicly describing the Soviet Union as an &quot;[[evil empire]]&quot;, he transitioned Cold War policy from [[détente]] to [[rollback]], by escalating an [[arms race]] with the USSR while engaging in talks with Soviet [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], which culminated in the [[INF Treaty]], shrinking both countries' nuclear arsenals</span>
