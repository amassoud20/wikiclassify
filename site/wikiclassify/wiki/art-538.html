				<span class='text'>49‚Äì55&lt;/ref&gt; supports this derivation of the name, but adds that a writer such as Voltaire would have intended it to also convey its connotations of speed and daring</span>
				<span class='text'>These come from associations with words such as &quot;''[[Equestrian vaulting|voltige]]''&quot; (acrobatics on a trapeze or horse), &quot;''[[volte-face]]''&quot; (a spinning about to face one's enemies), and &quot;''volatile''&quot; (originally, any winged creature)</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This probably refers to [[Adenes le Roi]], and the 'oi' diphthong was then pronounced like modern 'ouai', so the similarity to 'Arouet' is clear, and thus, it could well have been part of his rationale</span>

				<span class='text'> Despite pointing out his deviations from neoclassical standards, Voltaire saw Shakespeare as an example that French writers might emulate, since French drama, despite being more polished, lacked on-stage action</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Because the publisher released the book without the approval of the royal censor and Voltaire regarded the British constitutional monarchy as more developed and more respectful of human rights (particularly religious tolerance) than its French counterpart, the French publication of ''Letters'' caused a huge scandal; the book was [[Book burning|burnt]]</span>

				<span class='text'>| In the frontispiece to Voltaire's book on Newton's philosophy, [[√âmilie du Ch√¢telet]] appears as Voltaire's muse, reflecting Newton's heavenly insights down to Voltaire</span>
				<span class='text'>]Voltaire's next destination was the Ch√¢teau de Cirey, on the borders of [[Champagne, France|Champagne]] and [[Lorraine (r√©gion)|Lorraine]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The building was renovated with his money, and here he began a relationship with the Marquise du Ch√¢telet, Gabrielle √âmilie le Tonnelier de Breteuil (famous in her own right as [[√âmilie du Ch√¢telet]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Cirey was owned by the Marquise's husband, Marquis Florent-Claude du Chatelet, who sometimes visited his wife and her lover at the chateau</span>
				<span class='text'>The relationship, which lasted for fifteen years, had a significant intellectual element</span>
				<span class='text'>Voltaire and the Marquise collected over 21,000 books, an enormous number for the time</span>
				<span class='text'>Together, they studied these books and performed experiments in the &quot;[[natural sciences]]&quot; in his laboratory</span>
				<span class='text'>Voltaire's experiments included an attempt to determine the elements of fire</span>
				<span class='text'>aving learned from his previous brushes with the authorities, Voltaire began his habit of keeping out of personal harm's way, and denying any awkward responsibility</span>
				<span class='text'>He continued to write plays, such as ''M√©rope'' (or ''La M√©rope fran√ßaise'') and began his long research into science and history</span>
				<span class='text'>Again, a main source of inspiration for Voltaire were the years of his British exile, during which he had been strongly influenced by the works of Sir [[Isaac Newton]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Voltaire strongly believed in Newton's theories, especially concerning [[optics]] (Newton's discovery that white light is composed of all the colours in the [[spectrum]] led to many experiments at Cirey), and gravity (Voltaire is the source of the famous story of Newton and the apple falling from the tree, which he had learned from Newton's niece in London and first mentioned in his &quot;Essai sur la po√©sie √©pique&quot;, or &quot;Essay on Epic Poetry&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough both Voltaire and the Marquise were curious about the philosophies of [[Gottfried Leibniz]], a contemporary and rival of Newton, they remained essentially &quot;Newtonians&quot;, despite the Marquise's adoption of certain aspects of Leibniz's arguments against Newton</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} She translated Newton's Latin ''Principia'' in full, adjusting a few errors along the way, and it remained the definitive French translation well into the 20th century</span>
				<span class='text'>Voltaire's book ''El√©ments de la philosophie de Newton'' (''Elements of Newton's Philosophy''), which was probably co-written with the Marquise, made Newton accessible to a far greater public</span>

				<span class='text'>Voltaire's second essay in English had been &quot;Essay upon the Civil Wars in France&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>It was followed by ''La Henriade'', an epic poem on the French [[King Henri IV]], glorifying his attempt to end the Catholic-Protestant massacres with the [[Edict of Nantes]], and by a historical novel on King [[Charles XII of Sweden]]</span>
				<span class='text'>These, along with his ''[[Letters on the English]]'' mark the beginning of Voltaire's open criticism of intolerance and established religions</span>
				<span class='text'>Voltaire and the Marquise also explored philosophy, particularly [[metaphysics]], the branch of philosophy that deals with being and with what lies beyond the material realm such as whether or not there is a God or souls, etc</span>
				<span class='text'>Voltaire and the Marquise analyzed the Bible, trying to discover its validity for their time</span>
				<span class='text'>Voltaire's critical views on religion are reflected in his belief in [[separation of church and state]] and religious freedom, ideas that he had formed after his stay in England</span>
				<span class='text'>n the fall of 1735, Voltaire was visited by [[Francesco Algarotti]], preparing a book about Newton</span>

				<span class='text'>This satire on [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s philosophy of optimistic determinism remains the work for which Voltaire is perhaps best known</span>

				<span class='text'>There was an elaborate ceremony, complete with an orchestra, and the music included a piece that [[Andr√© Gr√©try]] had composed specially for the event, which included a part for the &quot;tuba curva&quot; (an instrument that originated in Roman times as the [[Cornu (horn)|cornu]] but had recently been revived under a new name&lt;ref&gt;Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed, 1954; &quot;Cornu&quot; article&lt;/ref&gt;)</span>
				<span class='text'>= Writings ===== History ===Voltaire had an enormous influence on the development of [[historiography]] through his demonstration of fresh new ways to look at the past</span>
				<span class='text'>His best-known histories are ''The Age of Louis XIV'' (1751), and his ''Essay on the Customs and the Spirit of the Nations'' (1756)</span>
				<span class='text'>He broke from the tradition of narrating diplomatic and military events, and emphasized customs, social history and achievements in the arts and sciences</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''Essay on Customs'' traced the progress of world civilization in a universal context, thereby rejecting both nationalism and the traditional Christian frame of reference</span>
				<span class='text'>Influenced by [[Jacques-B√©nigne Bossuet|Bossuet]]'s ''Discourse on the Universal History'' (1682), he was the first scholar to make a serious attempt to write the history of the world, eliminating theological frameworks, and emphasizing economics, culture and political history</span>
				<span class='text'>He treated Europe as a whole, rather than a collection of nations</span>
				<span class='text'>He was the first to emphasize the debt of medieval culture to Middle Eastern civilization, but otherwise was weak on the Middle Ages</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he repeatedly warned against political bias on the part of the historian, he did not miss many opportunities to expose the intolerance and frauds of the church over the ages</span>
				<span class='text'>Voltaire advised scholars that anything contradicting the normal course of nature was not to be believed</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he found evil in the historical record, he fervently believed reason and educating the illiterate masses would lead to progress</span>
				<span class='text'>oltaire explains his view of historiography in his article on &quot;History&quot; in Diderot's ''[[Encyclop√©die]]'': ''&quot;One demands of modern historians more details, better ascertained facts, precise dates, more attention to customs, laws, mores, commerce, finance, agriculture, population</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;'' Voltaire's histories imposed the values of the Enlightenment on the past, but at the same time he helped free historiography from antiquarianism, Eurocentrism, religious intolerance and a concentration on great men, diplomacy, and warfare</span>

				<span class='text'>He wrote two book-long epic poems, including the first ever written in French, the ''[[Henriade]]'', and later, ''[[The Maid of Orleans (poem)|The Maid of Orleans]]'', besides many other smaller pieces</span>
				<span class='text'>he ''Henriade'' was written in imitation of [[Virgil]], using the [[Alexandrine]] couplet reformed and rendered monotonous for modern readers but it was a huge success in the 18th and early 19th century, with sixty-five editions and translations into several languages</span>
				<span class='text'>The epic poem transformed French King Henry IV into a national hero for his attempts at instituting tolerance with his Edict of Nantes</span>
				<span class='text'>[[The Maid of Orleans (poem)|''La Pucelle'']], on the other hand, is a [[burlesque]] on the legend of [[Joan of Arc]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Voltaire's minor poems are generally considered superior to either of these two works</span>

				<span class='text'>of Voltaire's ''[[Candide]]'', 1762]]Many of Voltaire's [[prose]] works and romances, usually composed as pamphlets, were written as [[polemics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[Candide]]'' attacks the passivity inspired by Leibniz's philosophy of [[optimism]]; ''L'Homme aux quarante ecus'' (''The Man of Forty Pieces of Silver''), certain social and political ways of the time; ''[[Zadig]]'' and others, the received forms of moral and metaphysical orthodoxy; and some were written to deride the Bible</span>
				<span class='text'>In these works, Voltaire's ironic style, free of exaggeration, is apparent, particularly the restraint and simplicity of the verbal treatment</span>
				<span class='text'>''Candide'' in particular is the best example of his style</span>
				<span class='text'>oltaire also has, in common with [[Jonathan Swift]], the distinction of paving the way for science fiction's philosophical irony, particularly in his ''[[Microm√©gas]]'' and the vignette ''[[Plato's Dream]]'' (1756)</span>

				<span class='text'>if|thumb|Voltaire at [[Frederick the Great]]'s ''[[Sanssouci]]'', by [[Pierre Charles Baquoy]]]]In general, his criticism and miscellaneous writing show a similar style to Voltaire's other works</span>
				<span class='text'>Almost all of his more substantive works, whether in verse or prose, are preceded by prefaces of one sort or another, which are models of his caustic yet conversational tone</span>
				<span class='text'>In a vast variety of nondescript pamphlets and writings, he displays his skills at journalism</span>
				<span class='text'>In pure literary criticism his principal work is the ''Commentaire sur Corneille'', although he wrote many more similar works{{spaced ndash}}sometimes (as in his ''Life and Notices of Moli√®re'') independently and sometimes as part of his ''Si√®cles''</span>
				<span class='text'>oltaire's works, especially his private letters, frequently contain the word ''&quot;l'inf√¢me&quot;'' and the expression ''&quot;√©crasez l'inf√¢me&quot;'', or &quot;crush the infamous&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The phrase refers to abuses of the people by royalty and the clergy that Voltaire saw around him, and the superstition and intolerance that the clergy bred within the people</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Charles Wirz, archivist at the Voltaire Institute and Museum in Geneva, recalled in 1994, that Hall 'wrongly' placed this quotation between speech marks in two of her works about Voltaire, recognising expressly the quotation in question was not one, in a letter of 9 May 1939, which was published in 1943 in volume LVIII under the title &quot;Voltaire never said it&quot; (pp</span>

				<span class='text'>An extract from the letter: 'The phrase &quot;I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it&quot; which you have found in my book ''Voltaire in His Letters'' is my own expression and should not have been put in inverted commas</span>
				<span class='text'>Please accept my apologies for having, quite unintentionally, misled you into thinking I was quoting a sentence used by Voltaire (or anyone else but myself)</span>

				<span class='text'>quot; The problem is that, if you consult the letter itself, the sentence there does not appear, nor even the idea: &quot;A M LE RICHE A AMIENS</span>

				<span class='text'>Receive my assurances, etc</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Voltaire, however, did not hesitate to wish censure against slander and personal libels</span>
				<span class='text'>Here is what he writes in his &quot;Atheism&quot; article in the ''Dictionnaire philosophique'': &quot;Aristophanes (this man that the commentators admire because he was Greek, not thinking that Socrates was Greek also), Aristophanes was the first who accustomed the Athenians to consider Socrates an atheist</span>
				<span class='text'>‚Ä¶ The tanners, the shoemakers and the dressmakers of Athens applauded a joke in which one represented Socrates raised in the air in a basket, announcing there was God, and praising himself to have stolen a coat by teaching philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>A whole people, whose bad government authorized such infamous licences, deserved well what it got, to become the slave of the Romans, and today of the Turks</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt;Voltaire's first major philosophical work in his battle against ''&quot;l'inf√¢me&quot;'' was the ''Trait√© sur la tol√©rance'' (''Treatise on Tolerance''), exposing the Calas affair, along with the tolerance exercised by other faiths and in other eras (for example, by the Jews, the Romans, the Greeks and the Chinese)</span>
				<span class='text'>Then, in his ''[[Dictionnaire philosophique]]'', containing such articles as &quot;Abraham&quot;, &quot;Genesis&quot;, &quot;Church Council&quot;, he wrote about what he perceived as the human origins of dogmas and beliefs, as well as inhuman behavior of religious and political institutions in shedding blood over the quarrels of competing sects</span>
				<span class='text'>Amongst other targets, Voltaire criticized France's colonial policy in North America, dismissing the vast territory of [[New France]] as &quot;[[a few acres of snow]]&quot; (''&quot;quelques arpents de neige&quot;'')</span>

				<span class='text'>After the fourth performance of the play, it was withdrawn by Voltaire after [[Andr√©-Hercule de Fleury|Cardinal Fleury]] advised him to do so</span>

				<span class='text'>In Durant's assessment, the play was an attack on any religion's endorsement of violence, and to illustrate the point Durant refers to a letter written by Voltaire to Frederick the Great in which Voltaire mentions the assassinations of [[William the Silent|William of Orange]], and [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] and [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] of France as examples of crimes originating from piety</span>

				<span class='text'>But his disappointments and disillusions with Frederick the Great changed his philosophy somewhat, and soon gave birth to one of his most enduring works, his novella ''[[Candide, ou l'Optimisme]]'' (''Candide, or Optimism,'' 1759), which ends with a new conclusion: &quot;It is up to us to cultivate our garden</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; His most polemical and ferocious attacks on intolerance and religious persecutions indeed began to appear a few years later</span>
