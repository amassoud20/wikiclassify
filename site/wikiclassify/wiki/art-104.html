				<span class='text'>The young composer's many musical activities during these vacations included playing four-hand pieces with von Meck at the piano, giving music lessons to her children, and performing in private concerts with some of her musician friends</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Edward Lockspeiser, ''Debussy: His Life and Mind'', vol</span>
				<span class='text'>1, The Macmillan Company, 1962, pp&amp;nbsp; 40–47</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Despite von Meck's closeness to Tchaikovsky, the Russian master appears to have had minimal effect on Debussy</span>
				<span class='text'>In September 1880 she sent Debussy's ''Danse bohémienne'' for Tchaikovsky's perusal</span>
				<span class='text'>A month later Tchaikovsky wrote back to her: &quot;It is a very pretty piece, but it is much too short</span>
				<span class='text'>Not a single idea is expressed fully, the form is terribly shriveled, and it lacks unity</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Debussy did not publish the piece, and the manuscript remained in the von Meck family; it was eventually sold to B</span>
				<span class='text'>Schott's Sohne in Mainz, and published by them in 1932</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Alexander Poznansky, ''Tchaikovsky: The Quest for the Inner Man'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;375&lt;/ref&gt;A greater influence was Debussy's close friendship with Marie-Blanche Vasnier, a singer he met when he began working as an accompanist to earn some money, embarking on an eight-year affair together</span>
				<span class='text'>She and her husband, Parisian civil servant Henri, gave Debussy emotional and professional support</span>
				<span class='text'>Henri Vasnier introduced him to the writings of influential French writers of the time, which gave rise to his first songs, settings of poems by [[Paul Verlaine]] (the son-in-law of his former teacher Mme</span>
				<span class='text'>Mauté de Fleurville)</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Debussy 1885</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|Debussy at the [[Villa Medici]] in Rome, 1885, at centre in the white jacket]]As the winner of the 1884 [[Prix de Rome]] with his composition ''[[L'enfant prodigue]]'', Debussy received a scholarship to the Académie des Beaux-Arts, which included a four-year residence at the [[Villa Medici]], the [[French Academy in Rome]], to further his studies (1885–1887)</span>
				<span class='text'>According to letters to Marie-Blanche Vasnier, perhaps in part designed to gain her sympathy, he found the artistic atmosphere stifling, the company boorish, the food bad, and the monastic quarters &quot;abominable&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;70&lt;/ref&gt; Neither did he delight in Italian opera, as he found the operas of [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]] and [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] not to his taste</span>
				<span class='text'>Debussy was often depressed and unable to compose, but he was inspired by [[Franz Liszt]], whose command of the keyboard he found admirable</span>
				<span class='text'>In June 1885, Debussy wrote of his desire to follow his own way, saying, &quot;I am sure the Institute would not approve, for, naturally it regards the path which it ordains as the only right one</span>
				<span class='text'>But there is no help for it! I am too enamoured of my freedom, too fond of my own ideas!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;77&lt;/ref&gt;Debussy finally composed four pieces that were sent to the Academy: the symphonic ode ''Zuleima'' (based on a text by [[Heinrich Heine]]); the orchestral piece ''Printemps''; the [[cantata]] ''La damoiselle élue'' (1887–1888) (which was criticized by the Academy as &quot;bizarre&quot;, although it was the first piece in which the stylistic features of Debussy's later style began to emerge); and the ''Fantaisie'' for piano and orchestra, which was heavily based on [[César Franck]]'s music and therefore eventually withdrawn by Debussy</span>
				<span class='text'>The Academy chided him for &quot;courting the unusual&quot; and hoped for something better from the gifted student</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Debussy's works showed the influence of [[Jules Massenet]], Massenet concluded, &quot;He is an enigma</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;82&lt;/ref&gt;During his visits to [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus|Bayreuth]] in 1888–9, Debussy was exposed to [[Richard Wagner|Wagnerian]] opera, which would have a lasting impact on his work</span>
				<span class='text'>Debussy, like many young musicians of the time, responded positively to Richard Wagner's sensuousness, mastery of form, and striking harmonies</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;leshow&quot; /&gt; Wagner's extroverted emotionalism was not to be Debussy's way, but the German composer's influence is evident in ''La damoiselle élue'' and the 1889 piece ''Cinq poèmes de Charles Baudelaire''</span>
				<span class='text'>Other songs of the period, notably the settings of Verlaine – ''[[Ariettes oubliées]]'', ''Trois mélodies'', and ''Fêtes galantes'' – are all in a more capricious style</span>
				<span class='text'>round this time, Debussy met [[Erik Satie]], who proved a kindred spirit in his experimental approach to composition and to naming his pieces</span>
				<span class='text'>Both musicians were bohemians during this period, enjoying the same cafe society and struggling to stay afloat financially</span>

				<span class='text'>At the age of 18 he began an eight-year affair with Marie-Blanche Vasnier, the wife of Parisian civil servant Henri</span>
				<span class='text'>The relationship eventually faltered following his winning of the [[Prix de Rome]] in 1884 and obligatory residence in Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>n his permanent return to Paris and his parents' home on the rue de Berlin (now rue de Liège) he began a tempestuous relationship with Gabrielle ('Gaby') Dupont, a tailor's daughter from [[Lisieux]], soon cohabiting with her on the rue de Londres, and later the rue Gustave Doré</span>
				<span class='text'>During this time he also had an affair with the singer [[Thérèse Roger]], to whom he was briefly engaged</span>
				<span class='text'>Such cavalier behaviour was widely condemned, and precipitated the end of his long friendship with [[Ernest Chausson]]</span>
				<span class='text'>e ultimately left Dupont for her friend Rosalie ('Lilly') Texier, a fashion model whom he married in 1899, after threatening suicide if she refused him</span>

				<span class='text'>Debussy briefly moved to an apartment at 10 avenue Alphand</span>
				<span class='text'>On 14 October, five days before their fifth wedding anniversary, Texier attempted suicide, shooting herself in the chest with a revolver while standing in the [[Place de la Concorde]]; she survived, although the bullet remained lodged in her [[vertebrae]] for the rest of her life</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;He concludes that Debussy's achievement was the synthesis of monophonic based &quot;melodic tonality&quot; with harmonies, albeit different from those of &quot;harmonic tonality&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>==List of works===* [[List of compositions by Claude Debussy by genre]]* [[List of compositions by Claude Debussy by Lesure numbers]]===Early works===[[File:Debussy 1893</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Debussy at the piano, in front of the composer [[Ernest Chausson]], 1893]]From the 1890s Debussy began to develop his own musical language which was largely independent of Wagner's style, coloured in part from the dreamy, sometimes morbid, romanticism of the Symbolist movement</span>
				<span class='text'>Debussy became a frequent participant at [[Stéphane Mallarmé]]'s Symbolist gatherings, where Wagnerism dominated the discussion</span>
				<span class='text'>However, in contrast to the enormous works of Wagner and other late-romantic composers around this time, Debussy chose to write in smaller, more accessible forms</span>
				<span class='text'>he ''[[Deux arabesques]]'' is an example of one of Debussy's earliest works, already developing his musical language</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[Suite bergamasque]]'' (1890) recalls [[rococo]] decorousness with a modern cynicism and puzzlement, and contains one of Debussy's most popular pieces, ''[[Suite bergamasque|Clair de Lune]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Debussy's [[String Quartet (Debussy)|String Quartet in G minor]] (1893) paved the way for his later more daring harmonic exploration, using the [[Phrygian mode]] as well as less standard scales such as the [[Whole-tone scale|whole-tone]], which creates a sense of floating, ethereal harmony</span>
				<span class='text'>Debussy was beginning to employ a single, continuous theme, breaking away from the traditional A-B-A form with its restatements and amplifications, which had been a mainstay of classical music since [[Haydn]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ebussy wrote one of his most famous works under the influence of Mallarmé, the revolutionary ''[[Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune]]'', which is truly original in form and execution</span>
				<span class='text'>In contrast to the large orchestras so favoured by late-romanticism, Debussy wrote this piece for a smaller ensemble, emphasizing instrumental colour and timbre</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite Mallarmé himself and colleague and friend [[Paul Dukas]] having been impressed by the piece, it was controversial at its premiere, but nevertheless established Debussy as one of the leading composers of the era</span>
				<span class='text'>==Middle works===&lt;!--Input intro stuff here--&gt;The three ''[[Nocturnes (Debussy)|Nocturnes]]'' (1899) include characteristic studies: in ''Nuages'', using veiled harmony and texture; ''Fêtes'', in exuberance; and ''Sirènes'', using whole-tones</span>
				<span class='text'>Debussy's only complete opera ''[[Pelléas et Mélisande (opera)|Pelléas et Mélisande]]'' premiered in 1902, after ten years of work, and contrasted sharply with Wagnerian opera</span>
				<span class='text'>Based on the play by [[Maurice Maeterlinck]], the opera proved to be an immediate success and immensely influential to younger French composers, including [[Maurice Ravel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>These works brought a fluidity of rhythm and colour quite new to Western music</span>
				<span class='text'>'[[La mer (Debussy)|La mer]]'' (1903–1905) essays a more symphonic form, with a finale that works themes from the first movement, although the middle movement, ''Jeux de vagues'', proceeds much less directly and with more variety of colour</span>
				<span class='text'>The reviews were once again sharply divided</span>
				<span class='text'>Some critics thought the treatment to be less subtle and less mysterious than his previous works, and even a step backward, with [[Pierre Lalo]] complaining &quot;I neither hear, nor see, nor feel the sea&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Others extolled its &quot;power and charm&quot;, its &quot;extraordinary verve and brilliant fantasy&quot;, and its strong colors and definite lines</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Thompson, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>158–59&lt;/ref&gt;Debussy wrote much for the piano during this period</span>
				<span class='text'>The set of pieces entitled ''[[Pour le piano]]'' (1901) uses rich harmonies and textures which would later prove important in [[jazz]] music</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=July 2012}} His first volume of ''Images pour piano'' (1904–1905) combines harmonic innovation with poetic suggestion: ''[[Reflets dans l'eau]]'' is a musical description of rippling water, whilst second piece ''Hommage à Rameau'' is slow and yearningly nostalgic, taking a melody from [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]]'s 1737 ''[[Castor et Pollux]]'' as its inspiration</span>
				<span class='text'>he evocative ''[[Estampes]]'' for piano (1903) give impressions of exotic locations</span>
				<span class='text'>Debussy came into contact with [[Java]]nese [[gamelan]] music during the 1889 Paris ''[[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Exposition Universelle]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>''Pagodes'' is the directly inspired result, aiming for an evocation of the pentatonic structures employed by Javanese music</span>

				<span class='text'>The suite recalls classicism — the opening piece ''Doctor Gradus ad Parnassum'' refers to [[Muzio Clementi]]'s collection of instructional piano compositions ''[[Gradus ad Parnassum]]'' — as well as a new wave of American ragtime music</span>
				<span class='text'>In the popular final piece of the suite, ''Golliwogg's Cakewalk'', Debussy also pokes fun at [[Richard Wagner]] by mimicking the opening bars of Wagner's prelude to ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>he first book of ''[[Préludes (Debussy)|Préludes]]'' (1910), twelve in total, proved to be his most successful work for piano</span>
				<span class='text'>The Preludes are frequently compared to those of [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;!--which set?--&gt; Debussy's preludes are replete with rich, unusual and daring harmonies</span>
				<span class='text'>They include the popular ''[[La fille aux cheveux de lin]]'' (The Girl with the Flaxen Hair) and ''La Cathédrale Engloutie'' (The Engulfed Cathedral), although since Debussy wanted people to respond intuitively to these pieces, their titles were placed at the end of each one in the hope that listeners would not make stereotype images as they listened</span>
				<span class='text'>arger scale works included his orchestral piece ''Iberia'' (1907), a [[triptych]] medley of Spanish allusions and fleeting impressions which was begun as a work for two pianos, and also the music for [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]]'s mystery play ''[[Le martyre de Saint Sébastien]]'' (1911)</span>
				<span class='text'>A lush and dramatic work, written in only two months, it is remarkable in sustaining a [[Late Antiquity|late antique]] [[musical mode|modal]] atmosphere that otherwise was touched only in relatively short piano pieces</span>
				<span class='text'>s Debussy gained in popularity, he was often engaged as a conductor throughout Europe during this period, most often performing ''Pelléas'', ''La Mer'', and ''Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune''</span>
				<span class='text'>He was also an occasional music critic, to supplement his conducting fees and piano lessons, writing under the pseudonym &quot;Monsieur Croche&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Debussy avoided analytical dissection and attempts to force images from music, saying &quot;Let us at all costs preserve this magic peculiar to music, since of all the arts it is most susceptible to magic</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He could be caustic and witty, sometimes sloppy and ill-informed</span>
				<span class='text'>Debussy was for the most part enthusiastic about [[Richard Strauss]]&lt;ref name=Croche&gt;Claude Debussy (1962)</span>

				<span class='text'>Unlike in his earlier work, he no longer hides discords in lush harmonies,&lt;ref&gt;Mark McFarland, &quot;Transpositional Combination and Aggregate Formation in Debussy,&quot; ''Music Theory Spectrum'' 27 no</span>

				<span class='text'>is two final volumes of works for the piano, the ''[[Études (Debussy)|Études]]'' (1915), interpret similar varieties of style and texture purely as pianistic exercises, and include pieces that develop irregular form to an extreme, as well as others influenced by the young [[Igor Stravinsky]] (a presence too in the suite ''En blanc et noir'' for two pianos, 1915)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Mark McFarland, &quot;Debussy and Stravinsky: Another Look into their Musical Relationship,&quot; ''Cahiers Debussy'' 24 (2000): 79–112&lt;/ref&gt; The rarefaction of these works is a feature of the last set of songs, the ''Trois poèmes de Mallarmé'' (1913), and of the [[Sonata for flute, viola and harp (Debussy)|Sonata for flute, viola and harp]] (1915), though the sonata and its companions also recapture the inquisitive Verlainian classicism</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Caplet Debussy</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|[[André Caplet|Caplet]] and Debussy]]With the sonatas of 1915–1917 there is a sudden shift in the style</span>
				<span class='text'>These works recall Debussy's earlier music in part, but also look forward, with leaner, simpler structures</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite the thinner textures of the [[Violin Sonata (Debussy)|Violin Sonata]] (1917), there remains an undeniable richness in the chords themselves</span>
				<span class='text'>This shift parallels the movement commonly known as [[Neoclassicism (music)|neo-classicism]], which became popular after Debussy's death in 1918</span>
				<span class='text'>Debussy planned a set of six sonatas, but had only completed three ([[Cello Sonata (Debussy)|cello]], flute-viola-harp, and violin) before he died</span>
				<span class='text'>he final orchestral work by Debussy, the ballet ''[[Jeux]]'' (1912) written for [[Sergei Diaghilev]]'s [[Ballets Russes]], contains some of his strangest harmonies and textures in a form that moves freely over its own field of motivic connection</span>
				<span class='text'>At first, ''Jeux'' was overshadowed by [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'', which was composed in the same year as ''Jeux'', and was premiered only two weeks later by the same ballet company</span>
				<span class='text'>Decades later, composers such as [[Pierre Boulez]] and [[Jean Barraqué]] pointed out parallels to [[Anton Webern]]'s [[serialism]] in this work</span>
				<span class='text'>ther late stage works, including the ballets ''[[Khamma (ballet)|Khamma]]'' (1912) and ''[[La boîte à joujoux]]'' (1913), were left with the orchestration incomplete, and were later completed by [[Charles Koechlin]] and [[André Caplet]], who also helped Debussy with the orchestration of ''Gigues'' (from ''Images pour orchestre'') and ''Le martyre de St</span>

				<span class='text'>Debussy consciously gives titles to each prelude which amplify the preludes' tonal ambiguity and dissonance</span>
				<span class='text'>He uses scales such as the whole tone scale, musical modes, and the octatonic scale in his preludes which exaggerate this tonal ambiguity, making the key of each prelude almost indistinguishable at times</span>

				<span class='text'>ISBN 978-3-8443-1643-8&lt;/ref&gt; It can be inferred that from the Russians &quot;Debussy acquired his taste for ancient and oriental modes and for vivid colorations, and a certain disdain for academic rules</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;leshow&quot; /&gt; Specifically, Mussorgsky's opera ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris Godunov]]'' directly influenced one of Debussy's most famous works, ''[[Pelléas et Mélisande (opera)|Pelléas et Mélisande]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition to the Russian composers, one of Debussy's biggest influences was Richard Wagner</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Pierre Louys, Debussy &quot;did not see 'what anyone can do beyond Tristan</span>
				<span class='text'>{'&quot;}}&lt;ref name=&quot;leshow&quot; /&gt;After Debussy's Wagner phase, he started to become immensely interested in non-Western music and its unorthodox approaches to composition</span>
				<span class='text'>Specifically, he was drawn to the Javanese [[Gamelan]]: a musical ensemble from the island of [[Java]] that played an array of unique instrumentation, including [[gongs]] and [[metallophones]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He first heard the gamelan at the 1889 Paris Exposition</span>
				<span class='text'>Debussy was not interested in directly quoting his non-Western influences, but instead allowed this non-Western aesthetic to generally influence his own musical work, for example, by frequently using quiet, unresolved dissonances, coupled with the damper pedal, to emulate the &quot;shimmering&quot; effect created by a [[gamelan]] ensemble</span>
				<span class='text'>ebussy was just as influenced by other art forms as he was by music, if not more so</span>
				<span class='text'>He took a strong interest in literature and visual art, and used these mediums to help shape his unique musical style</span>
				<span class='text'>Debussy was heavily influenced by the French symbolist movement of the 1880s, which encompassed poetry, visual art, and theatre</span>
				<span class='text'>He shared the movement's interest in the esoteric and indefinite and their rejection of [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]] and [[Realism (arts)|realism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Specifically, &quot;the development of [[free verse]] in poetry and the disappearance of the subject or model in painting influenced Debussy to think about issues of musical form</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;leshow&quot; /&gt; Debussy became personally acquainted with writers and painters of the movement, and based some of his own works on those of the symbolists</span>
				<span class='text'>The poet [[Stéphane Mallarmé]] was a major influence, who in talking of &quot;a 'musicalization' of poetry&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;leshow&quot; /&gt; laid claim to a strong connection between music and his own poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>Debussy's &quot;[[Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune]]&quot; was directly influenced by Mallarmé's poem [[L'après-midi d'un faune (poem)|&quot;Afternoon of a Faun&quot;]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Like the symbolists in respect to their own art forms, Debussy aimed to reject common techniques and approaches to composition and attempted to evoke more of a sensorial experience for the listener with his works</span>
				<span class='text'>Since his time at the Paris Conservatoire, Debussy believed he had much more to learn from artists than from musicians, who were primarily interested in their musical careers</span>
				<span class='text'>bove all, Debussy was inspired by nature and the impression it made on the mind, making a pantheistic profession of faith when he called &quot;mysterious [[Pantheism|Nature]]&quot; his religion</span>
				<span class='text'>'I do not practice religion in accordance with the sacred rites</span>
				<span class='text'>I have made mysterious Nature my religion</span>
				<span class='text'>I do not believe that a man is any nearer to God for being clad in priestly garments, nor that one place in a town is better adapted to meditation than another</span>
				<span class='text'>When I gaze at a sunset sky and spend hours contemplating its marvellous ever-changing beauty, an extraordinary emotion overwhelms me</span>
				<span class='text'>Nature in all its vastness is truthfully reflected in my sincere though feeble soul</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1894, Debussy wrote to violinist [[Eugène Ysaÿe]] describing his ''[[Nocturnes (Debussy)|Nocturnes]]'' as &quot;an experiment in the different combinations that can be obtained from one color—what a study in grey would be in painting</span>

				<span class='text'>==Influence on later composers==={{Unreferenced section|date=November 2012}}Claude Debussy is widely regarded as one of the most influential composers of the 20th century</span>
				<span class='text'>His innovative harmonies were influential to almost every major composer of the 20th century, particularly [[Maurice Ravel]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Olivier Messiaen]], [[Béla Bartók]], [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Henri Dutilleux]], [[Ned Rorem]], [[George Gershwin]], and the [[minimalist music]] of [[Steve Reich]] and [[Philip Glass]] as well as the influential Japanese composer [[Toru Takemitsu]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also influenced many important figures in [[jazz]], most notably [[Miles Davis]], [[Duke Ellington]], [[Bix Beiderbecke]], [[George Shearing]], [[Thelonious Monk]], [[Bill Evans]], [[Jimmy Giuffre]], [[Antônio Carlos Jobim]], [[Django Reinhardt]], and [[Herbie Hancock]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also had a profound impact on contemporary soundtrack composers such as [[John Williams]], because Debussy's colourful and evocative style translated easily into an emotional language for use in motion picture scores</span>
