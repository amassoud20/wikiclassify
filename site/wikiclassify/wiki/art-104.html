				<span class='text'>Debussy always believed her although there is no independent evidence to support her claim</span>
				<span class='text'> His talents soon became evident and in 1872 at age ten Debussy entered the  where he spent the next 11 years</span>
				<span class='text'>During his time there he studied composition with  music history theory with  harmony with   piano with  organ with  and  with  as well as other significant figures of the era</span>
				<span class='text'>He also became a lifelong friend of fellow student and distinguished pianist </span>
				<span class='text'>After Debussys death many pianists sought Philipps advice on playing Debussys works</span>

				<span class='text'> Despite von Mecks closeness to Tchaikovsky the Russian master appears to have had minimal effect on Debussy</span>
				<span class='text'>In September 1880 she sent Debussys Danse bohémienne for Tchaikovskys perusal</span>
				<span class='text'>A month later Tchaikovsky wrote back to her It is a very pretty piece but it is much too short</span>
				<span class='text'>Not a single idea is expressed fully the form is terribly shriveled and it lacks unity</span>

				<span class='text'>She and her husband Parisian civil servant Henri gave Debussy emotional and professional support</span>
				<span class='text'>Henri Vasnier introduced him to the writings of influential French writers of the time which gave rise to his first songs settings of poems by  the son in law of his former teacher Mme</span>

				<span class='text'>Debussy was often depressed and unable to compose but he was inspired by  whose command of the keyboard he found admirable</span>
				<span class='text'>In June 1885 Debussy wrote of his desire to follow his own way saying I am sure the Institute would not approve for naturally it regards the path which it ordains as the only right one</span>
				<span class='text'>But there is no help for it I am too enamoured of my freedom too fond of my own ideasThompson p</span>
				<span class='text'>mpnbsp77 Debussy finally composed four pieces that were sent to the Academy the symphonic ode Zuleima based on a text by  the orchestral piece Printemps the  La damoiselle élue 1887–1888 which was criticized by the Academy as bizarre although it was the first piece in which the stylistic features of Debussys later style began to emerge and the Fantaisie for piano and orchestra which was heavily based on s music and theore eventually withdrawn by Debussy</span>
				<span class='text'>The Academy chided him for courting the unusual and hoped for something better from the gifted student</span>

				<span class='text'>mpnbsp82 During his visits to  in 1888–9 Debussy was exposed to  opera which would have a lasting impact on his work</span>
				<span class='text'>Debussy like many young musicians of the time responded positively to Richard Wagners sensuousness mastery of form and striking harmonies</span>
				<span class='text'>name leshow   Wagners extroverted emotionalism was not to be Debussys way but the German composers influence is evident in La damoiselle élue and the 1889 piece Cinq poèmes de Charles Baudelaire</span>
				<span class='text'>Other songs of the period notably the settings of Verlaine –  Trois mélodies and Fêtes galantes – are all in a more capricious style</span>
				<span class='text'>round this time Debussy met  who proved a kindred spirit in his experimental approach to composition and to naming his pieces</span>
				<span class='text'>Both musicians were bohemians during this period enjoying the same cafe society and struggling to stay afloat financially</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1889 at the  in Paris Debussy first heard nese  music</span>
				<span class='text'>He incorporated gamelan scales melodies rhythms and ensemble textures into some of his compositions most notably Pagodes from his piano collection </span>
				<span class='text'>Personal lifeDebussys private life was often turbulent</span>
				<span class='text'>At the age of 18 he began an eight year affair with Marie Blanche Vasnier the wife of Parisian civil servant Henri</span>

				<span class='text'>n his permanent return to Paris and his parents home on the rue de Berlin now rue de Liège he began a tempestuous relationship with Gabrielle Gaby Dupont a tailors daughter from  soon cohabiting with her on the rue de Londres and later the rue Gustave Doré</span>
				<span class='text'>During this time he also had an affair with the singer  to whom he was briefly engaged</span>
				<span class='text'>Such cavalier behaviour was widely condemned and precipitated the end of his long friendship with </span>

				<span class='text'>The application of the term Impressionist to Debussy and the music he influenced is a matter of intense debate within academic circles</span>
				<span class='text'>One side argues that the term is a misnomer an inappropriate label which Debussy himself opposed</span>

				<span class='text'> From the 1890s Debussy began to develop his own musical language which was largely independent of Wagners style coloured in part from the dreamy sometimes morbid romanticism of the Symbolist movement</span>
				<span class='text'>Debussy became a frequent participant at s Symbolist gatherings where Wagnerism dominated the discussion</span>
				<span class='text'>However in contrast to the enormous works of Wagner and other late romantic composers around this time Debussy chose to write in smaller more accessible forms</span>
				<span class='text'>he  is an example of one of Debussys earliest works already developing his musical language</span>
				<span class='text'> 1890 recalls  decorousness with a modern cynicism and puzzlement and contains one of Debussys most popular pieces </span>
				<span class='text'>Debussys  1893 paved the way for his later more daring harmonic exploration using the  as well as less standard scales such as the  which creates a sense of floating ethereal harmony</span>
				<span class='text'>Debussy was beginning to employ a single continuous theme breaking away from the traditional A B A form with its restatements and amplifications which had been a mainstay of classical music since </span>
				<span class='text'>ebussy wrote one of his most famous works under the influence of Mallarmé the revolutionary  which is truly original in form and execution</span>
				<span class='text'>In contrast to the large orchestras so favoured by late romanticism Debussy wrote this piece for a smaller ensemble emphasizing instrumental colour and timbre</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite Mallarmé himself and colleague and friend  having been impressed by the piece it was controversial at its premiere but nevertheless established Debussy as one of the leading composers of the era</span>

				<span class='text'>Debussys only complete opera  premiered in 1902 after ten years of work and contrasted sharply with Wagnerian opera</span>

				<span class='text'>The reviews were once again sharply divided</span>
				<span class='text'>Some critics thought the treatment to be less subtle and less mysterious than his previous works and even a step backward with  complaining I neither hear nor see nor feel the sea</span>

				<span class='text'>158–59 Debussy wrote much for the piano during this period</span>
				<span class='text'>The set of pieces entitled  1901 uses rich harmonies and textures which would later prove important in  music</span>
				<span class='text'>His first volume of Images pour piano 1904–1905 combines harmonic innovation with poetic suggestion  is a musical description of rippling water whilst second piece Hommage à Rameau is slow and yearningly nostalgic taking a melody from s 1737  as its inspiration</span>

				<span class='text'>Pagodes is the directly inspired result aiming for an evocation of the pentatonic structures employed by Javanese music</span>
				<span class='text'>Debussy wrote his famous  Suite 1908 for his beloved daughter Claude Emma whom he nicknamed Chouchou</span>
				<span class='text'>The suite recalls classicism — the opening piece Doctor Gradus ad Parnassum ers to s collection of instructional piano compositions  — as well as a new wave of American ragtime music</span>
