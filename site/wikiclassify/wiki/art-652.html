				<span class='text'>He served as [[First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|First Secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] from 1953 to 1964, and as [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union|Council of Ministers]], or Premier, from 1958 to 1964</span>
				<span class='text'>Khrushchev was responsible for the [[de-Stalinization]] of the Soviet Union, for backing the progress of the early [[Soviet space program]], and for several relatively liberal reforms in areas of domestic policy</span>
				<span class='text'>Khrushchev's party colleagues removed him from power in 1964, replacing him with [[Leonid Brezhnev]] as First Secretary and [[Alexei Kosygin]] as Premier</span>
				<span class='text'>hrushchev was born in the village of [[Kalinovka, Khomutovsky District, Kursk Oblast|Kalinovka]] in 1894, close to the present-day border between [[Russia]] and [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukraine]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was employed as a metalworker in his youth, and during the [[Russian Civil War]] was a [[political commissar]]</span>
				<span class='text'>With the help of [[Lazar Kaganovich]], he worked his way up the Soviet hierarchy</span>
				<span class='text'>He supported [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge|purges]], and approved thousands of arrests</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1938, Stalin sent him to govern Ukraine, and he continued the purges there</span>
				<span class='text'>During what was known in the Soviet Union as the [[Great Patriotic War (term)|Great Patriotic War]] ([[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front of World War II]]), Khrushchev was again a commissar, serving as an intermediary between Stalin and his generals</span>
				<span class='text'>Khrushchev was present at the bloody [[Battle of Stalingrad|defense of Stalingrad]], a fact he took great pride in throughout his life</span>
				<span class='text'>After the war, he returned to Ukraine before being recalled to Moscow as one of Stalin's close advisers</span>
				<span class='text'>n the power struggle triggered by Stalin's death in 1953, Khrushchev, after several years, emerged victorious</span>
				<span class='text'>On February 25, 1956, at the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|20th Party Congress]], he delivered the &quot;[[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|Secret Speech]]&quot;, denouncing Stalin's purges and ushering in [[Khrushchev Thaw|a less repressive era]] in the Soviet Union</span>
				<span class='text'>His domestic policies, aimed at bettering the lives of ordinary citizens, were often ineffective, especially in agriculture</span>
				<span class='text'>Hoping eventually to rely on missiles for national defense, Khrushchev ordered major cuts in conventional forces</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite the cuts, Khrushchev's rule saw the most tense years of the Cold War, culminating in the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ome of Khrushchev's policies were seen as erratic, particularly by his emerging rivals within the Party, who quietly rose in strength and deposed him in October 1964</span>
				<span class='text'>He did not suffer the deadly fate of some previous losers of Soviet power struggles, and was pensioned off with an apartment in Moscow and a ''[[dacha]]'' in the countryside</span>
				<span class='text'>His lengthy memoirs were smuggled to the West and published in part in 1970</span>
				<span class='text'>Khrushchev died in 1971 of heart disease</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=2}} Sergei Khrushchev was employed in a number of positions in the [[Donbas]] area of far eastern Ukraine, working as a railwayman, as a miner, and laboring in a brick factory</span>
				<span class='text'>Wages were much higher in the Donbas than in the Kursk region, and Sergei Khrushchev generally left his family in Kalinovka, returning there when he had enough money</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|150px| Khrushchev in 1916]]Kalinovka was a peasant village; Khrushchev's teacher, Lydia Shevchenko later stated that she had never seen a village as poor as Kalinovka had been</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=27}} Nikita worked as a [[Herder|herdsboy]] from an early age</span>
				<span class='text'>He was schooled for a total of four years, part in the village parochial school and part under Shevchenko's tutelage in Kalinovka's state school</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Khrushchev in his memoirs, Shevchenko was a freethinker who upset the villagers by not attending church, and when her brother visited, he gave the boy books which had been banned by the Imperial Government</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=26}} She urged Nikita to seek further education, but family finances did not permit this</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=26}}In 1908, Sergei Khrushchev moved to the Donbas city of [[Donetsk|Yuzovka]]; fourteen-year-old Nikita followed later that year, while Ksenia Khrushcheva and her daughter came after</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=30}} Yuzovka, which was renamed Stalino in 1924 and [[Donetsk]] in 1961, was at the heart of one of the most industrialized areas of the Russian Empire</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=30}} After the boy worked briefly in other fields, Khrushchev's parents found him a place as a metal fitter's apprentice</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon completing that apprenticeship, the teenage Khrushchev was hired by a factory</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=6–7}} He lost that job when he collected money for the families of the victims of the [[Lena Goldfields Massacre]], and was hired to mend underground equipment by a mine in nearby Rutchenkovo,{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=37–38}} where his father was the union organizer, and he helped distribute copies and organize public readings of ''[[Pravda]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=8}} He later stated that he considered emigrating to the United States for better wages, but did not do so</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Carlson|2009|p=141}}When [[World War I]] broke out in 1914, Khrushchev, as a skilled metal worker, was exempt from [[conscription]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Employed by a workshop which serviced ten mines, Khrushchev was involved in several strikes demanding higher pay, better working conditions, and an end to the war</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=8–9}} In 1914, he married Yefrosinia Pisareva, daughter of the elevator operator at the Rutchenkovo mine</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1915, they had a daughter, Yulia, and in 1917, a son, Leonid</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=38–40}}After the abdication of [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II]] in 1917, the new [[Russian Provisional Government]] in [[Petrograd]] had little influence over Ukraine</span>
				<span class='text'>Khrushchev was elected to the worker's council (or ''soviet'') in Rutchenkovo, and in May he became its chairman</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=47}} He did not join the [[Bolshevik]]s until 1918, a year in which the [[Russian Civil War]], between the Bolsheviks and a coalition of opponents known as the [[White Movement|White Army]], began in earnest</span>
				<span class='text'>His biographer, [[William Taubman]], suggests that Khrushchev's delay in affiliating himself with the Bolsheviks was because he felt closer to the [[Menshevik]]s who prioritized economic progress, whereas the Bolsheviks sought political power</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=47–48}} In his memoirs, Khrushchev indicated that he waited because there were many groups, and it was difficult to keep them all straight</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=47–48}}In March 1918, as the Bolshevik government concluded [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|a separate peace]] with the [[Central Powers]], [[Ukrainian War of Independence#German intervention and Hetmanate, 1918|the Germans occupied the Donbas]] and Khrushchev fled to Kalinovka</span>
				<span class='text'>In late 1918 or early 1919 he was mobilized into the [[Red Army]] as a [[political commissar]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=48–49}} The post of political commissar had recently been introduced as the Bolsheviks came to rely less on worker activists and more on military recruits; its functions included indoctrination of recruits in the tenets of Bolshevism, and promoting troop morale and battle readiness</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=50}} Beginning as commissar to a construction platoon, Khrushchev rose to become commissar to a construction battalion and was sent from the front for a two-month political course</span>
				<span class='text'>The young commissar came under fire many times,{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=12}} though many of the war stories he would tell in later life dealt more with his (and his troops') cultural awkwardness, rather than with combat</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=50}} In 1921, [[Russian Civil War|the civil war]] ended, and Khrushchev was demobilized and assigned as commissar to a labor brigade in the Donbas, where he and his men lived in poor conditions</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=50}}The wars had caused widespread devastation and famine, and one of the victims of the hunger and disease was Khrushchev's wife, Yefrosinia, who died of [[typhus]] in Kalinovka while Khrushchev was in the army</span>
				<span class='text'>The commissar returned for the funeral and, loyal to his [[Soviet anti-religious legislation|Bolshevik principles]], refused to allow his wife's coffin to enter the local church</span>
				<span class='text'>With the only way into the churchyard through the church, he had the coffin lifted and passed over the fence into the burial ground, shocking the village</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=50}}== Party official ===== Donbas years ===Through the intervention of a friend, Khrushchev was assigned in 1921 as assistant director for political affairs for the Rutchenkovo mine in the Donbas region, where he had previously worked</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=52}} There were as yet few Bolsheviks in the area</span>
				<span class='text'>At that time, the movement was split by [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]'s [[New Economic Policy]], which allowed for some measure of private enterprise and was seen as an ideological retreat by some Bolsheviks</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=52}} While Khrushchev's responsibility lay in political affairs, he involved himself in the practicalities of resuming full production at the mine after the chaos of the war years</span>
				<span class='text'>He helped restart the machines (key parts and papers had been removed by the pre-Soviet mineowners) and he wore his old mine outfit for inspection tours</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=54–55}}Khrushchev was highly successful at the Rutchenkovo mine, and in mid-1922 he was offered the directorship of the nearby Pastukhov mine</span>
				<span class='text'>However, he refused the offer, seeking to be assigned to [[Donetsk National Technical University|the newly established technical college]] (''tekhnikum'') in Yuzovka, though his superiors were reluctant to let him go</span>
				<span class='text'>As he had only four years of formal schooling, he applied to the training program (''rabfak'') attached to the ''tekhnikum'' that was designed to bring undereducated students to high-school level, a prerequisite for entry into the ''tekhnikum''</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=55}} While enrolled in the ''rabfak'', Khrushchev continued his work at the Rutchenkovo mine</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=14}} One of his teachers later described him as a poor student</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=55}} He was more successful in advancing in the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]]; soon after his admission to the ''rabfak'' in August 1922, he was appointed party secretary of the entire ''tekhnikum'', and became a member of the bureau—the governing council—of the party committee for the town of Yuzovka (renamed Stalino in 1924)</span>
				<span class='text'>He briefly joined supporters of [[Leon Trotsky]] against those of [[Joseph Stalin]] over the question of party democracy</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=56–57}} All of these activities left him with little time for his schoolwork, and while he later claimed to have finished his ''rabfak'' studies, it is unclear whether this was true</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=56–57}}In 1922, Khrushchev met and married his second wife, Marusia, whose maiden name is unknown</span>
				<span class='text'>The two soon separated, though Khrushchev helped Marusia in later years, especially when Marusia's daughter by a previous relationship suffered a fatal illness</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon after the abortive marriage, Khrushchev met [[Nina Petrovna Khrushcheva|Nina Petrovna Kukharchuk]], a well-educated Party organizer and daughter of well-to-do Ukrainian peasants</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=58–59}} The two lived together as husband and wife for the rest of Khrushchev's life, though they did not register their marriage until 1965</span>
				<span class='text'>They had three children together: daughter Rada was born in 1929, son [[Sergei Khrushchev|Sergei]] in 1935 and daughter Elena in 1937</span>
				<span class='text'>n mid-1925, Khrushchev was appointed Party secretary of the Petrovo-Marinsky ''raikom'', or district, near Stalino</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''raikom'' was about {{convert|400|sqmi|km2}} in area, and Khrushchev was constantly on the move throughout his domain, taking an interest in even minor matters</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=16–17}} In late 1925, Khrushchev was elected a non-voting delegate to the [[14th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (b)|14th Congress of the USSR Communist Party]] in Moscow</span>

				<span class='text'>Khrushchev is left behind Yagoda</span>
				<span class='text'>]Khrushchev met [[Lazar Kaganovich]] as early as 1917</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1925, Kaganovich became Party head in Ukraine{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=64–66}} and Khrushchev, falling under his patronage,{{sfn|Whitman|1971}} was rapidly promoted</span>
				<span class='text'>He was appointed second in command of the Stalino party apparatus in late 1926</span>
				<span class='text'>Within nine months his superior, Konstantin Moiseyenko, was ousted, which, according to Taubman, was due to Khrushchev's instigation</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=64–66}} Kaganovich transferred Khrushchev to [[Kharkov]], then the capital of Ukraine, as head of the Organizational Department of the Ukrainian Party's Central Committee</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=66}} In 1928, Khrushchev was transferred to [[Kiev]], where he served as second-in-command of the Party organization there</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=68}}In 1929, Khrushchev again sought to further his education, following Kaganovich (now in the [[Kremlin]] as a close associate of Stalin) to Moscow and enrolling in the [[Industrial Academy (Moscow)|Stalin Industrial Academy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Khrushchev never completed his studies there, but his career in the Party flourished</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=73}} When the school's Party cell elected a number of rightists to an upcoming district Party conference, the cell was attacked in ''[[Pravda]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=31–32}} Khrushchev emerged victorious in the ensuing power struggle, becoming Party secretary of the school, arranging for the delegates to be withdrawn, and afterward purging the cell of the rightists</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=31–32}} Khrushchev rose rapidly through the Party ranks, first becoming Party leader for the Bauman district, site of the Academy, before taking the same position in the Krasnopresnensky district, the capital's largest and most important</span>
				<span class='text'>By 1932, Khrushchev had become second in command, behind Kaganovich, of the [[Moscow City Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Moscow city Party organization]], and in 1934, he became Party leader for the city{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=73}} and a member of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party's Central Committee]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=78}} Khrushchev attributed his rapid rise to his acquaintance with fellow Academy student [[Nadezhda Alliluyeva]], Stalin's wife</span>
				<span class='text'>In his memoirs, Khrushchev stated that Alliluyeva spoke well of him to her husband</span>
				<span class='text'>His biographer, William Tompson, downplays the possibility, stating that Khrushchev was too low in the Party hierarchy to enjoy Stalin's patronage, and that if influence was brought to bear on Khrushchev's career at this stage, it was by Kaganovich</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=33–34}}While head of the Moscow city organization, Khrushchev superintended construction of the [[Moscow Metro]], a highly expensive undertaking, with Kaganovich in overall charge</span>
				<span class='text'>Faced with an already-announced opening date of November 7, 1934, Khrushchev took considerable risks in the construction and spent much of his time down in the tunnels</span>
				<span class='text'>When the inevitable accidents did occur, they were depicted as heroic sacrifices in a great cause</span>
				<span class='text'>The Metro did not open until May 1, 1935, but Khrushchev received the [[Order of Lenin]] for his role in its construction</span>

				<span class='text'>The two increasingly built a good relationship</span>
				<span class='text'>Khrushchev greatly admired the dictator and treasured informal meetings with him and invitations to Stalin's ''dacha'', while Stalin felt warm affection for his young subordinate</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=105–06}}Beginning in 1934, Stalin began a campaign of political repression known as the [[Great Purge]], during which millions of people were executed or sent to the [[Gulag]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Central to this campaign were [[Moscow Trials]], a series of [[show trial]]s of the purged top leaders of the party and the military</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1936, as the trials proceeded, Khrushchev expressed his vehement support:&lt;blockquote&gt;Everyone who rejoices in the successes achieved in our country, the victories of our party led by the great Stalin, will find only one word suitable for the mercenary, fascist dogs of the Trotskyite-[[Grigory Zinoviev|Zinovievite]] gang</span>
				<span class='text'>That word is execution</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=98}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;Khrushchev assisted in the purge of many friends and colleagues in Moscow ''oblast''</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=99}} Of 38&amp;nbsp;top Party officials in Moscow city and province, 35 were killed{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=99}}—the three survivors were transferred to other parts of the USSR</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=57}} Of the 146&amp;nbsp;Party secretaries of cities and districts outside Moscow city in the province, only 10 survived the purges</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=99}} In his memoirs, Khrushchev noted that almost everyone who worked with him was arrested</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=99–100}} By Party protocol, Khrushchev was required to approve these arrests, and did little or nothing to save his friends and colleagues</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=100}}Party leaders were given numerical quotas of &quot;enemies&quot; to be turned in and arrested</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=100}} In June 1937, the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] set a quota of 35,000&amp;nbsp;enemies to be arrested in Moscow province; 5,000 of these were to be executed</span>
				<span class='text'>In reply, Khrushchev asked that 2,000&amp;nbsp;wealthy peasants, or ''[[kulak]]s'' living in Moscow be killed in part fulfillment of the quota</span>
				<span class='text'>In any event, only two weeks after receiving the Politburo order, Khrushchev was able to report to Stalin that 41,305&amp;nbsp;&quot;criminal and ''kulak'' elements&quot; had been arrested</span>
				<span class='text'>Of the arrestees, according to Khrushchev, 8,500 deserved execution</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=100}}Khrushchev had no reason to think himself immune from the purges, and in 1937, confessed his own 1923 dalliance with Trotskyism to Kaganovich, who, according to Khrushchev, &quot;blanched&quot; (for his protégé's sins could affect his own standing) and advised him to tell Stalin</span>
				<span class='text'>The dictator took the confession in his stride, and, after initially advising Khrushchev to keep it quiet, suggested that Khrushchev tell his tale to the Moscow party conference</span>
				<span class='text'>Khrushchev did so, to applause, and was immediately reelected to his post</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=103–04}} Khrushchev related in his memoirs that he was also denounced by an arrested colleague</span>
				<span class='text'>Stalin told Khrushchev of the accusation personally, looking him in the eye and awaiting his response</span>
				<span class='text'>Khrushchev speculated in his memoirs that had Stalin doubted his reaction, he would have been categorized as an [[enemy of the people]] then and there</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=104}} Nonetheless, Khrushchev became a candidate member of the Politburo in January 1938 and a full member in March 1939</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=69}}In late 1937, Stalin appointed Khrushchev as head of the Communist Party in Ukraine, and Khrushchev duly left Moscow for Kiev, again the Ukrainian capital, in January 1938</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=114–15}} Ukraine had been the site of extensive purges, with the murdered including professors in Stalino whom Khrushchev greatly respected</span>
				<span class='text'>The high ranks of the Party were not immune; the Central Committee of Ukraine was so devastated that it could not convene a quorum</span>
				<span class='text'>After Khrushchev's arrival, the pace of arrests accelerated</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=116}} All but one member of the Ukrainian Politburo Organizational Bureau and Secretariat were arrested</span>
				<span class='text'>Almost all government officials and Red Army commanders were replaced</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=118}} During the first few months after Khrushchev's arrival, almost everyone arrested received the death penalty</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=60}}Biographer William Taubman suggests that, since Khrushchev was again unsuccessfully denounced while in Kiev, he must have known that some of the denunciations were not true and that innocent people were suffering</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=118}} In 1939, Khrushchev addressed the Fourteenth Ukrainian Party Congress, saying &quot;Comrades, we must unmask and relentlessly destroy all enemies of the people</span>

				<span class='text'>We must conduct a struggle against slanderers</span>

				<span class='text'>A large number of ethnic Ukrainians lived in the invaded area, much of which today forms the western portion of Ukraine</span>
				<span class='text'>Many inhabitants therefore initially welcomed the invasion, though they hoped that they would eventually become independent</span>
				<span class='text'>Khrushchev's role was to ensure that the occupied areas voted for union with the USSR</span>
				<span class='text'>Through a combination of propaganda, deception as to what was being voted for, and outright fraud, the Soviets ensured that their new territories would elect assemblies which would unanimously petition for union with the USSR</span>
				<span class='text'>When the new assemblies did so, their petitions were granted by the USSR Supreme Soviet, and Western Ukraine became a part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (SSR) on November 1, 1939</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=135–37}} Clumsy actions by the Soviets, such as staffing Western Ukrainian organizations with Eastern Ukrainians, and giving confiscated land to collective farms (''kolkhozes'') rather than to peasants, soon alienated Western Ukrainians damaging Khrushchev's efforts to achieve unity</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=72}}=== War against Germany ===When [[Operation Barbarossa|Nazi Germany invaded the USSR]], in June 1941, Khrushchev was still at his post in Kiev</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=149}} Stalin appointed him a political commissar, and Khrushchev served on a number of fronts as an intermediary between the local military commanders and the political rulers in Moscow</span>
				<span class='text'>Stalin used Khrushchev to keep commanders on a tight leash, while the commanders sought to have him influence Stalin</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=150}} As the Germans advanced, Khrushchev worked with the military in an attempt to defend and save Kiev</span>
				<span class='text'>Handicapped by orders from Stalin that under no circumstances should the city be abandoned, the Red Army was soon [[Battle of Kiev (1941)|encircled by the Germans]]</span>
				<span class='text'>While the Germans stated they took 655,000&amp;nbsp;prisoners, according to the Soviets, 150,541&amp;nbsp;men out of 677,085 escaped the trap</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=163}} Primary sources differ on Khrushchev's involvement at this point</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Marshal [[Georgy Zhukov|Georgi Zhukov]], writing some years after Khrushchev fired and disgraced him in 1957, Khrushchev persuaded Stalin not to evacuate troops from Kiev</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=162–64}} However, Khrushchev noted in his memoirs that he and Marshal [[Semyon Budyonny]] proposed redeploying Soviet forces to avoid the encirclement until Marshal [[Semyon Timoshenko]] arrived from Moscow with orders for the troops to hold their positions</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Khrushchev|2004|p=347}} Early Khrushchev biographer Mark Frankland suggested that Khrushchev's faith in his leader was first shaken by the Red Army's setbacks</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Whitman|1971}} Khrushchev stated in his memoirs:{{quote|But let me return to the enemy breakthrough in the Kiev area, the encirclement of our group, and the destruction of the 37th Army</span>

				<span class='text'>All of this was senseless, and from the military point of view, a display of ignorance, incompetence, and illiteracy</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>There you have the result of not taking a step backward</span>
				<span class='text'>We were unable to save these troops because we didn't withdraw them, and as a result we simply lost them</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>And yet it was possible to allow this not to happen</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Khrushchev|2004|pp=349–50}}}}In 1942, Khrushchev was on the Southwest Front, and he and Timoshenko proposed a massive counteroffensive in the [[Kharkov]] area</span>
				<span class='text'>Stalin approved only part of the plan, but 640,000&amp;nbsp;Red Army soldiers would still become involved in the offensive</span>
				<span class='text'>The Germans, however, had deduced that the Soviets were likely to [[Second Battle of Kharkov|attack at Kharkov]], and set a trap</span>
				<span class='text'>Beginning on May 12, 1942, the Soviet offensive initially appeared successful, but within five days the Germans had driven deep into the Soviet flanks, and the Red Army troops were in danger of being cut off</span>
				<span class='text'>Stalin refused to halt the offensive, and the Red Army divisions were soon encircled by the Germans</span>
				<span class='text'>The USSR lost about 267,000&amp;nbsp;soldiers, including more than 200,000&amp;nbsp;men captured, and Stalin demoted Timoshenko and recalled Khrushchev to Moscow</span>
				<span class='text'>While Stalin hinted at arresting and executing Khrushchev, he allowed the commissar to return to the front by sending him to [[Stalingrad]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=164–68}}[[File:RIAN archive 882837 The defenders of Stalingrad</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=168–71}} His role in the Stalingrad defense was not major—General [[Vasily Chuikov]], who led the city's defense, mentions Khrushchev only briefly in a memoir published while Khrushchev was premier—but to the end of his life, he was proud of his role</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=81}} Though he visited Stalin in Moscow on occasion, he remained in Stalingrad for much of the battle, and was nearly killed at least once</span>
				<span class='text'>He proposed a counterattack, only to find that Zhukov and other generals had already planned [[Operation Uranus|Operation ''Uranus'']], a plan to break out from Soviet positions and encircle and destroy the Germans; it was being kept secret</span>
				<span class='text'>Before ''Uranus'' was launched, Khrushchev spent much time checking on troop readiness and morale, interrogating Nazi prisoners, and recruiting some for propaganda reasons</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=168–71}}Soon after Stalingrad, Khrushchev met with personal tragedy, as his son [[Leonid Khrushchev|Leonid]], a fighter pilot, was apparently shot down and killed in action on March 11, 1943</span>
				<span class='text'>The circumstances of Leonid's death remain obscure and controversial,{{sfn|Birch|2008}} as none of his fellow fliers stated that they witnessed him being shot down, nor was his plane found or body recovered</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, Leonid's fate has been the subject of considerable speculation</span>
				<span class='text'>One theory has Leonid surviving the crash and collaborating with the Germans, and when he was recaptured by the Soviets, Stalin ordering him shot despite Nikita Khrushchev pleading for his life</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Birch|2008}} This supposed killing is used to explain why Khrushchev later denounced Stalin in the Secret Speech</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Birch|2008}}{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=157–58}} While there is no supporting evidence for this account in Soviet files, some historians allege that Leonid Khrushchev's file was tampered with after the war</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=82}} In later years, Leonid Khrushchev's wingmate stated that he saw his plane disintegrate, but did not report it</span>
				<span class='text'>Khrushchev biographer Taubman speculates that this omission was most likely to avoid the possibility of being seen as complicit in the death of the son of a Politburo member</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=158}} In mid-1943, Leonid's wife, Liuba Khrushcheva, was arrested on accusations of spying and sentenced to five years in a labor camp, and her son (by another relationship), Tolya, was placed in a series of orphanages</span>
				<span class='text'>Leonid's daughter, Yulia, was raised by Nikita Khrushchev and his wife</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=158–62}}After ''Uranus'' forced the Germans into retreat, Khrushchev served in other fronts of the war</span>
				<span class='text'>He was attached to Soviet troops at the [[Battle of Kursk]], in July 1943, which turned back the last major German offensive on Soviet soil</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=171–72}} Khrushchev related that he interrogated an [[SS]] defector, learning that the Germans intended an attack—a claim dismissed by his biographer Taubman as &quot;almost certainly exaggerated&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=177–78}} He accompanied Soviet troops as they took Kiev in November 1943, entering the shattered city as Soviet forces drove out German troops</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=177–78}} As Soviet forces met with greater success, driving the Nazis westwards towards Germany, Nikita Khrushchev became increasingly involved in reconstruction work in Ukraine</span>
				<span class='text'>He was appointed Premier of the Ukrainian SSR in addition to his earlier party post, one of the rare instances in which the Ukrainian party and civil leader posts were held by one person</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=81–82}}According to Khrushchev biographer William Tompson, it is difficult to assess Khrushchev's war record, since he most often acted as part of a military council, and it is not possible to know the extent to which he influenced decisions, rather than signing off on the orders of military officers</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Tompson points to the fact that the few mentions of Khrushchev in military memoirs published during the [[Leonid Brezhnev|Brezhnev]] era were generally favorable, at a time when it was &quot;barely possible to mention Khrushchev in print in any context&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=73}} Tompson suggests that these favorable mentions indicate that military officers held Khrushchev in high regard</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=73}}== Rise to power ===== Return to Ukraine ===Almost all of Ukraine had been occupied by the Germans, and Khrushchev returned to his domain in late 1943 to find devastation</span>
				<span class='text'>Ukraine's industry had been destroyed, and agriculture faced critical shortages</span>
				<span class='text'>Even though millions of Ukrainians had been taken to Germany as workers or prisoners of war, there was insufficient housing for those who remained</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=86}} One out of every six Ukrainians was killed in World War II</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=179}}Khrushchev sought to reconstruct Ukraine, but also desired to complete the interrupted work of imposing the Soviet system on it, though he hoped that the purges of the 1930s would not recur</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=180}} As Ukraine was recovered militarily, conscription was imposed, and 750,000&amp;nbsp;men aged between nineteen and fifty were given minimal military training and sent to join the Red Army</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=181}} Other Ukrainians joined partisan forces, seeking an independent Ukraine</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=181}} Khrushchev rushed from district to district through Ukraine, urging the depleted labor force to greater efforts</span>
				<span class='text'>He made a short visit to his birthplace of Kalinovka, finding a starving population, with only a third of the men who had joined the Red Army having returned</span>
				<span class='text'>Khrushchev did what he could to assist his hometown</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=193–95}} Despite Khrushchev's efforts, in 1945, Ukrainian industry was at only a quarter of pre-war levels, and the harvest actually dropped from that of 1944, when the entire territory of Ukraine had not yet been retaken</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=86}}In an effort to increase agricultural production, the ''[[kolkhoz]]es'' (collective farms) were empowered to expel residents who were not pulling their weight</span>
				<span class='text'>''Kolkhoz'' leaders used this as an excuse to expel their personal enemies, invalids, and the elderly, and nearly 12,000&amp;nbsp;people were sent to the eastern parts of the Soviet Union</span>
				<span class='text'>Khrushchev viewed this policy as very effective, and recommended its adoption elsewhere to Stalin</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=86}} He also worked to impose [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivization]] on Western Ukraine</span>
				<span class='text'>While Khrushchev hoped to accomplish this by 1947, lack of resources and armed resistance by partisans slowed the process</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=87–88}} The partisans, many of whom fought as the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] (UIA), were gradually defeated, as Soviet police and military reported killing 110,825 &quot;bandits&quot; and capturing a quarter million more between 1944 and 1946</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=195}} About 600,000&amp;nbsp;Western Ukrainians were arrested between 1944 and 1952, with one-third executed and the remainder imprisoned or exiled to the east</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=195}}The war years of 1944 and 1945 had seen poor harvests, and 1946 saw intense drought strike Ukraine and Western Russia</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite this, collective and state farms were required to turn over 52% of the harvest to the government</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=91}} The [[Soviet government]] sought to collect as much grain as possible in order to supply communist allies in Eastern Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=199}} Khrushchev set the quotas at a high level, leading Stalin to expect an unrealistically large quantity of grain from Ukraine</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=199–200}} Food was rationed—but non-agricultural rural workers throughout the USSR were given no ration cards</span>
				<span class='text'>The inevitable starvation was largely confined to remote rural regions, and was little noticed outside the USSR</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=91}} Khrushchev, realizing the desperate situation in late 1946, repeatedly appealed to Stalin for aid, to be met with anger and resistance on the part of the leader</span>
				<span class='text'>When letters to Stalin had no effect, Khrushchev flew to Moscow and made his case in person</span>
				<span class='text'>Stalin finally gave Ukraine limited food aid, and money to set up free [[soup kitchen]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=200–201}} However, Khrushchev's political standing had been damaged, and in February 1947, Stalin suggested that Lazar Kaganovich be sent to Ukraine to &quot;help&quot; Khrushchev</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=92}} The following month, the Ukrainian Central Committee removed Khrushchev as party leader in favor of Kaganovich, while retaining him as premier</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=203}}Soon after Kaganovich arrived in Kiev, Khrushchev fell ill, and was barely seen until September 1947</span>
				<span class='text'>In his memoirs, Khrushchev indicates he had pneumonia; some biographers have theorized that Khrushchev's illness was entirely political, out of fear that his loss of position was the first step towards downfall and demise</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=93}} However, Khrushchev's children remembered their father as having been seriously ill</span>
				<span class='text'>Once Khrushchev was able to get out of bed, he and his family took their first vacation since before the war, to a beachfront resort in [[Latvia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=203}} Khrushchev, though, soon broke the beach routine with duck-hunting trips, and a visit to newly Soviet [[Kaliningrad]], where he toured factories and quarries</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Khrushchev|2000|p=27}} By the end of 1947, Kaganovich had been recalled to Moscow and the recovered Khrushchev had been restored to the First Secretaryship</span>
				<span class='text'>He then resigned the Ukrainian premiership in favor of [[Demyan Korotchenko]], Khrushchev's protégé</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=93}}Khrushchev's final years in Ukraine were generally peaceful, with industry recovering,{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=95}} Soviet forces overcoming the partisans, and 1947 and 1948 seeing better-than-expected harvests</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=205}} Collectivization advanced in Western Ukraine, and Khrushchev implemented more policies that encouraged collectivization and discouraged private farms</span>
				<span class='text'>These sometimes backfired, however: a tax on private livestock holdings led to peasants slaughtering their stock</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=96}} With the idea of eliminating differences in attitude between town and countryside and transforming the peasantry into a &quot;rural proletariat&quot;, Khrushchev conceived the idea of the &quot;agro-town&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=96–97}} Rather than agricultural workers living in villages close to farms, they would live further away in larger towns which would offer municipal services such as utilities and libraries, which were not present in villages</span>
				<span class='text'>He completed only one such town before his December 1949 return to Moscow; he dedicated it to Stalin as a 70th birthday present</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=96–97}}In his memoirs, Khrushchev spoke highly of Ukraine, where he governed for over a decade:&lt;blockquote&gt;I'll say that the Ukrainian people treated me well</span>
				<span class='text'>I recall warmly the years I spent there</span>
				<span class='text'>This was a period full of responsibilities, but pleasant because it brought satisfaction&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>But far be it from me to inflate my significance</span>
				<span class='text'>The entire Ukrainian people was exerting great efforts&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>I attribute Ukraine's successes to the Ukrainian people as a whole</span>
				<span class='text'>I won't elaborate further on this theme, but in principle it's very easy to demonstrate</span>
				<span class='text'>I'm Russian myself, and I don't want to offend the Russians</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Khrushchev|2006|pp=16–17}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;=== Stalin's final years ===Khrushchev attributed his recall to Moscow to mental disorder on the part of Stalin, who feared conspiracies in Moscow matching those which the ruler believed to have occurred in the fabricated [[Leningrad case]], in which many of that city's Party officials had been falsely accused of treason</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Khrushchev|2006|pp=18–22}} Khrushchev again served as head of the Party in Moscow city and province</span>
				<span class='text'>Khrushchev biographer Taubman suggests that Stalin most likely recalled Khrushchev to Moscow to balance the influence of [[Georgy Malenkov]] and security chief [[Lavrentiy Beria]], who were widely seen as Stalin's heirs</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=210}}At this time, the aging leader rarely called Politburo meetings</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, much of the high-level work of government took place at dinners hosted by Stalin</span>
				<span class='text'>These sessions, which Beria, Malenkov, Khrushchev, Kaganovich, [[Kliment Voroshilov]], [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], and [[Nikolai Bulganin]], who comprised Stalin's inner circle, attended, began with showings of cowboy movies favored by Stalin</span>

				<span class='text'> and insisted that his subordinates stay with him and drink until dawn</span>
				<span class='text'>On one occasion, Stalin had Khrushchev, then aged almost sixty, dance [[hopak|a traditional Ukrainian dance]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Khrushchev did so, later stating, &quot;When Stalin says dance, a wise man dances</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=211–15}} Khrushchev attempted to nap at lunch so that he would not fall asleep in Stalin's presence; he noted in his memoirs, &quot;Things went badly for those who dozed off at Stalin's table</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Khrushchev|2006|p=43}}In 1950, Khrushchev began a large-scale housing program for Moscow</span>
				<span class='text'>A large part of the housing was in the form of five- or six-story apartment buildings, which became ubiquitous throughout the Soviet Union; many remain in use today</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=226}} These structures were completed at triple the construction rate of Moscow housing from 1946–1950, lacked elevators or balconies, and were nicknamed ''[[Khrushchyovka]]'' by the public, but because of their shoddy workmanship sometimes disparagingly called ''Khrushchoba'', a [[portmanteau]] formed from the name Khrushchev and the Russian word ''trushchoba'', meaning &quot;slum&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>This resulted in farms that were too large for one chairman to manage effectively</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=100–01}} Khrushchev also sought to implement his agro-town proposal, but when his lengthy speech on the subject was published in ''[[Pravda]]'' in March 1951, Stalin disapproved of it</span>
				<span class='text'>The periodical quickly published a note stating that Khrushchev's speech was merely a proposal, not policy</span>
				<span class='text'>In April, the Politburo disavowed the agro-town proposal</span>
				<span class='text'>Khrushchev feared that Stalin would remove him from office, but the leader mocked Khrushchev, then allowed the episode to pass</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=228–30}}On March 1, 1953, Stalin suffered a massive stroke, apparently on rising after sleep</span>
				<span class='text'>Stalin had left orders not to be disturbed, and it was twelve hours until his condition was discovered</span>
				<span class='text'>Even as terrified doctors attempted treatment, Khrushchev and his colleagues engaged in intense discussion as to the new government</span>
				<span class='text'>On March 5, Stalin died</span>
				<span class='text'>As Khrushchev and other high officials stood weeping by Stalin's bedside, Beria raced from the room, shouting for his car</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=236–41}}Khrushchev reflected on Stalin in his memoirs:&lt;blockquote&gt;Stalin called everyone who didn't agree with him an &quot;enemy of the people</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He said that they wanted to restore the old order, and for this purpose, &quot;the enemies of the people&quot; had linked up with the forces of reaction internationally</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, several hundred thousand honest people perished</span>
				<span class='text'>Everyone lived in fear in those days</span>
				<span class='text'>Everyone expected that at any moment there would be a knock on the door in the middle of the night and that knock on the door would prove fatal&amp;nbsp;</span>

				<span class='text'>&lt;nowiki&gt;[P]&lt;/nowiki&gt;eople not to Stalin's liking were annihilated, honest party members, irreproachable people, loyal and hard workers for our cause who had gone through the school of revolutionary struggle under Lenin's leadership</span>

				<span class='text'>Malenkov was the new Chairman of the Council of Ministers, with Beria (who consolidated his hold over the security agencies), Kaganovich, Bulganin, and former [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Foreign Minister]] [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] as [[First Deputy Premier of the Soviet Union|first vice-chairmen]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Those members of the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Presidium of the Central Committee]] who had been recently promoted by Stalin were demoted</span>
				<span class='text'>Khrushchev was relieved of his duties as Party head for Moscow to concentrate on unspecified duties in the Party's Central Committee</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=114}} ''The New York Times'' listed Malenkov and Beria first and second among the ten-man Presidium—and Khrushchev last</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|''The New York Times'', 1953-03-10}}However, on March 14, Malenkov resigned from the secretariat of the Central Committee</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=245}} This came due to concerns that he was acquiring too much power</span>
				<span class='text'>The major beneficiary was Khrushchev</span>
				<span class='text'>His name appeared atop a revised list of secretaries—indicating that he was now in charge of the party</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=258}}Even before Stalin had been laid to rest, Beria launched a lengthy series of reforms which rivalled those of Khrushchev during his period of power and even those of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] a third of a century later</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=245}} Beria's proposals were designed to denigrate Stalin and pass the blame for Beria's own crimes to the late leader</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=245}} One proposal, which was adopted, was an amnesty which eventually led to the freeing of over a million prisoners</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=246}} Another, which was not, was to release [[East Germany]] into a united, neutral Germany in exchange for compensation from the West{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=247}}—a proposal considered by Khrushchev to be anti-communist</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Khrushchev|2006|p=184}} Khrushchev allied with Malenkov to block many of Beria's proposals, while the two slowly picked up support from other Presidium members</span>
				<span class='text'>Their campaign against Beria was aided by fears that Beria was planning a military coup,{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=121}} and, according to Khrushchev in his memoirs, by the conviction that &quot;Beria is getting his knives ready for us</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Khrushchev|2006|p=186}}On June 26, 1953 Beria was arrested at a Presidium meeting, following extensive military preparations by Khrushchev and his allies</span>
				<span class='text'>Beria was tried in secret, and executed in December 1953 with five of his close associates</span>
				<span class='text'>The execution of Beria proved to be the last time the loser of a top-level Soviet power struggle paid with his life</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=123}}The power struggle in the Presidium was not resolved by the elimination of Beria</span>
				<span class='text'>Malenkov's power was in the central state apparatus, which he sought to extend through reorganizing the government, giving it additional power at the expense of the Party</span>
				<span class='text'>He also sought public support by lowering retail prices and lowering the level of bond sales to citizens, which had long been effectively obligatory</span>
				<span class='text'>Khrushchev, on the other hand, with his power base in the Party, sought to both strengthen the Party and his position within it</span>
				<span class='text'>While, under the Soviet system, the Party was to be preeminent, it had been greatly drained of power by Stalin, who had given much of that power to himself and to the Politburo (later, to the Presidium)</span>
				<span class='text'>Khrushchev saw that with the Presidium in conflict, the Party and its Central Committee might again become powerful</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=125–26}} Khrushchev carefully cultivated high Party officials, and was able to appoint supporters as local Party bosses, who then took seats on the Central Committee</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=259}}Khrushchev presented himself as a down-to-earth activist prepared to take up any challenge, contrasting with Malenkov who, though sophisticated, came across as colorless</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=259}} Khrushchev arranged for the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] grounds to be opened to the public, an act with &quot;great public resonance&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=263}} While both Malenkov and Khrushchev sought reforms to agriculture, Khrushchev's proposals were broader, and included the [[Virgin Lands Campaign]], under which hundreds of thousands of young volunteers would settle and farm areas of Western [[Siberia]] and Northern [[Kazakhstan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>While the scheme eventually became a tremendous disaster for Soviet agriculture,{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=262–63}} it was initially successful</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=174}} In addition, Khrushchev possessed incriminating information on Malenkov, taken from Beria's secret files</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=260}} As Soviet prosecutors investigated the atrocities of Stalin's last years, including the Leningrad case, they came across evidence of Malenkov's involvement</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=263–64}} Beginning in February 1954, Khrushchev replaced Malenkov in the seat of honor at Presidium meetings; in June, Malenkov ceased to head the list of Presidium members, which was thereafter organized in alphabetical order</span>
				<span class='text'>Khrushchev's influence continued to increase, winning the allegiance of local party heads, and with his nominee heading the [[KGB]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=264}}At a Central Committee meeting in January 1955, Malenkov was accused of involvement in atrocities, and the committee passed a resolution accusing him of involvement in the Leningrad case, and of facilitating Beria's climb to power</span>
				<span class='text'>At a meeting of the mostly ceremonial [[Supreme Soviet]] the following month, Malenkov was demoted in favor of Bulganin, to the surprise of Western observers</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Fursenko|2006|pp=15–17}} Malenkov remained in the Presidium as Minister of Electric Power Stations</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=141}} According to Khrushchev biographer William Tompson, &quot;Khrushchev's position as first among the members of the [[collective leadership]] was now beyond any reasonable doubt</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=266}} However, Khrushchev and Molotov increasingly differed on policy</span>
				<span class='text'>Molotov opposed the Virgin Lands policy, instead proposing heavy investment to increase yields in developed agricultural areas, which Khrushchev felt was not feasible due to a lack of resources and a lack of a sophisticated farm labor force</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=266–67}} The two differed on foreign policy as well; soon after Khrushchev took power, he sought a peace treaty with Austria, which would allow Soviet troops then in occupation of part of the country to leave</span>
				<span class='text'>Molotov was resistant, but Khrushchev arranged for an Austrian delegation to come to Moscow and negotiate the treaty</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Fursenko|2006|p=27}} Although Khrushchev and other Presidium members attacked Molotov at a Central Committee meeting in mid-1955, accusing him of conducting a foreign policy which turned the world against the USSR, Molotov remained in his position</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=268–69}}By the end of 1955, thousands of political prisoners had returned home, and told their experiences of the [[gulag|gulag labor camps]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=275}} Continuing investigation into the abuses brought home the full breadth of Stalin's crimes to his successors</span>
				<span class='text'>Khrushchev believed that once the stain of Stalinism was removed, the Party would inspire loyalty among the people</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=276}} Beginning in October 1955, Khrushchev fought to tell the delegates to the upcoming [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|20th Party Congress]] about Stalin's crimes</span>
				<span class='text'>Some of his colleagues, including Molotov and Malenkov, opposed the disclosure, and managed to persuade him to make his remarks in a closed session</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=279–80}}The 20th Party Congress opened on February 14, 1956</span>
				<span class='text'>In his opening words in his initial address, Khrushchev denigrated Stalin by asking delegates to rise in honor of the communist leaders who had died since the last congress, whom he named, equating Stalin with [[Klement Gottwald]] and the little-known [[Kyuichi Tokuda]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=153}} In the early morning hours of February 25, Khrushchev delivered what became known as the &quot;[[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences|Secret Speech]]&quot; to a closed session of the Congress limited to Soviet delegates</span>
				<span class='text'>In four hours, he demolished Stalin's reputation</span>
				<span class='text'>Khrushchev noted in his memoirs that the &quot;congress listened to me in silence</span>
				<span class='text'>As the saying goes, you could have heard a pin drop</span>
				<span class='text'>It was all so sudden and unexpected</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Khrushchev|2006|p=212}} Khrushchev told the delegates:{{quote|It is here that Stalin showed in a whole series of cases his intolerance, his brutality, and his abuse of power&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>he often chose the path of repression and physical annihilation, not only against actual enemies, but also against individuals who had not committed any crimes against the party or the Soviet Government</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|''The New York Times'', 1956-05-06}}}}The Secret Speech, while it did not fundamentally change Soviet society, had wide-ranging effects</span>
				<span class='text'>The speech was a factor in [[Poznań 1956 protests|unrest in Poland]] and [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|revolution in Hungary]] later in 1956, and Stalin defenders led [[1956 Georgian demonstrations|four days of rioting]] in his native Georgia in June, calling for Khrushchev to resign and Molotov to take over</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=286–91}} In meetings where the Secret Speech was read, communists would make even more severe condemnations of Stalin (and of Khrushchev), and even call for multi-party elections</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Stalin was not publicly denounced, and his portrait remained widespread through the USSR, from airports to Khrushchev's Kremlin office</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Mikhail Gorbachev]], then a [[Komsomol]] official, recalled that though young and well-educated Soviets in his district were excited by the speech, many others decried it, either defending Stalin or seeing little point in digging up the past</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=286–91}} Forty years later, after the fall of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev applauded Khrushchev for his courage in taking a huge political risk and showing himself to be &quot;a moral man after all&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=282}}The term &quot;Secret Speech&quot; proved to be an utter misnomer</span>
				<span class='text'>While the attendees at the Speech were all Soviet, Eastern European delegates were allowed to hear it the following night, read slowly to allow them to take notes</span>
				<span class='text'>By March 5, copies were being mailed throughout the Soviet Union, marked &quot;not for the press&quot; rather than &quot;top secret&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>An official translation appeared within a month in Poland; the Poles printed 12,000 extra copies, one of which soon reached the West</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=279–80}} Khrushchev's son, [[Sergei Khrushchev|Sergei]], later wrote, &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;[C]&lt;/nowiki&gt;learly, Father tried to ensure it would reach as many ears as possible</span>
				<span class='text'>It was soon read at Komsomol meetings; that meant another eighteen million listeners</span>
				<span class='text'>If you include their relatives, friends, and acquaintances, you could say that the entire country became familiar with the speech&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Spring had barely begun when the speech began circulating around the world</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Khrushchev|2000|p=200}}The anti-Khrushchev minority in the Presidium was augmented by those opposed to Khrushchev's proposals to decentralize authority over industry, which struck at the heart of Malenkov's power base</span>
				<span class='text'>During the first half of 1957, Malenkov, Molotov, and Kaganovich worked to quietly build support to dismiss Khrushchev</span>
				<span class='text'>At a June 18 Presidium meeting at which two Khrushchev supporters were absent, the plotters moved that Bulganin, who had joined the scheme, take the chair, and proposed other moves which would effectively demote Khrushchev and put themselves in control</span>
				<span class='text'>Khrushchev objected on the grounds that not all Presidium members had been notified, an objection which would have been quickly dismissed had Khrushchev not held firm control over the military, through [[List of Ministers of Defense of the Soviet Union|Minister of Defense]] Marshal Zhukov, and the security departments</span>
				<span class='text'>Lengthy Presidium meetings took place, continuing over several days</span>
				<span class='text'>As word leaked of the power struggle, members of the Central Committee, which Khrushchev controlled, streamed to Moscow, many flown there aboard military planes, and demanded to be admitted to the meeting</span>
				<span class='text'>While they were not admitted, there were soon enough Central Committee members in Moscow to call an emergency Party Congress, which effectively forced the leadership to allow a session of the Central Committee</span>
				<span class='text'>At that meeting, the three main conspirators were dubbed the [[Anti-Party Group]], accused of factionalism and complicity in Stalin's crimes</span>
				<span class='text'>The three were expelled from the Central Committee and Presidium, as was former Foreign Minister and Khrushchev client [[Dmitri Shepilov]] who joined them in the plot</span>
				<span class='text'>Molotov was sent as Ambassador to [[Mongolia]]; the others were sent to head industrial facilities and institutes far from Moscow</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=176–83}}Marshal Zhukov was rewarded for his support with full membership in the Presidium, but Khrushchev feared his popularity and power</span>
				<span class='text'>In October, the defense minister was sent on a tour of the Balkans, as Khrushchev arranged a Presidium meeting to dismiss him</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhukov learned what was happening, and hurried back to Moscow, only to be formally notified of his dismissal</span>
				<span class='text'>At a Central Committee meeting several weeks later, not a word was said in Zhukov's defense</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=361–64}} Khrushchev completed the consolidation of power by arranging for Bulganin's dismissal as premier in favor of himself (Bulganin was appointed to head the ''[[Gosbank]]'') and by establishing a USSR Defense Council, led by himself, effectively making him commander in chief</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=189}} Though Khrushchev was now preeminent, he did not enjoy Stalin's absolute power</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=189}}====Liberalization and the arts===={{main|Khrushchev Thaw}}[[File:Dwight Eisenhower Nikita Khrushchev and their wives at state dinner 1959</span>
				<span class='text'>ng|thumb|Nina Khrushchev, [[Mamie Eisenhower]], Khrushchev, and [[Dwight Eisenhower]] at a [[state dinner]] in 1959]]After assuming power, Khrushchev allowed a modest amount of freedom in the arts</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Vladimir Dudintsev]]'s ''[[Not by Bread Alone]]'',{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=307}} about an idealistic engineer opposed by rigid bureaucrats, was allowed to be published in 1956, though Khrushchev called the novel &quot;false at its base&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=308}} In 1958, however, Khrushchev ordered a fierce attack on [[Boris Pasternak]] after his novel ''[[Doctor Zhivago (novel)|Doctor Zhivago]]'' was published abroad (he was denied permission to publish it in the Soviet Union)</span>
				<span class='text'>''Pravda'' described the novel as &quot;low-grade reactionary hackwork&quot;, and the author was expelled from the Writer's Union</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=385}} To make things worse (from Khrushchev's perspective), Pasternak was awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]], which, under heavy pressure, he declined</span>
				<span class='text'>Once he did so, Khrushchev ordered a halt to the attacks on Pasternak</span>
				<span class='text'>In his memoirs, Khrushchev stated that he agonized over the novel, very nearly allowed it to be published, and later regretted not doing so</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=385}} After his fall from power, Khrushchev obtained a copy of the novel and read it (he had earlier read only excerpts) and stated, &quot;We shouldn't have banned it</span>
				<span class='text'>I should have read it myself</span>
				<span class='text'>There's nothing anti-Soviet in it</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=628}}Khrushchev believed that the USSR could match the West's living standards, and was not afraid to allow Soviet citizens to see Western achievements</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Zubok|2007|p=175}} Stalin had permitted few tourists to the Soviet Union, and had allowed few Soviets to travel</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Zubok|2007|p=172}} Khrushchev let Soviets travel (over 700,000 Soviet citizens travelled abroad in 1957) and allowed foreigners to visit the Soviet Union, where tourists became subjects of immense curiosity</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Zubok|2007|p=172}} In 1957, Khrushchev authorized the [[6th World Festival of Youth and Students]] to be held in Moscow that summer</span>
				<span class='text'>He instructed [[Komsomol]] officials to &quot;smother foreign guests in our embrace&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Zubok|2007|p=174}} The resulting &quot;socialist carnival&quot; involved over three million Moscovites, who joined with 30,000 young foreign visitors in events that ranged from discussion groups throughout the city to events at the Kremlin itself</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Zubok|2007|pp=174–75}} According to historian [[Vladislav Zubok]], the festival &quot;shattered propagandist clichés&quot; about Westerners by allowing Moscovites to see them for themselves</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Zubok|2007|p=175}}In 1962, Khrushchev, impressed by [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]]'s ''[[One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]'', persuaded the Presidium to allow publication</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=525–28}} That renewed thaw ended on December 1, 1962, when Khrushchev was taken to the [[Manezh Gallery]] to view an exhibit which included a number of [[avant-garde]] works</span>
				<span class='text'>On seeing them, Khrushchev exploded with anger, describing the artwork as &quot;dog shit&quot;,{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=257–60}} and proclaiming that &quot;a donkey could smear better art with its tail&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Neizvestny|1979}} A week later, ''Pravda'' issued a call for artistic purity</span>
				<span class='text'>When writers and filmmakers defended the painters, Khrushchev extended his anger to them</span>
				<span class='text'>However, despite the premier's rage, none of the artists were arrested or exiled</span>
				<span class='text'>The Manezh Gallery exhibit remained open for some time after Khrushchev's visit, and experienced a considerable rise in attendance after the article in ''Pravda''</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=257–60}}==== Political reform ====Under Khrushchev, the special tribunals operated by security agencies were abolished</span>
				<span class='text'>These tribunals (known as ''troikas''), had often ignored laws and procedures</span>
				<span class='text'>Under the reforms, no prosecution for a political crime could be brought even in the regular courts unless approved by the local Party committee</span>
				<span class='text'>This rarely happened; there were no major political trials under Khrushchev, and at most several hundred political prosecutions overall</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, other sanctions were imposed on dissidents, including loss of job or university place, or expulsion from the Party</span>
				<span class='text'>During Khrushchev's rule, forced hospitalization for the &quot;socially dangerous&quot; was introduced</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1978|pp=41–42}} According to author Roy Medvedev, who wrote an early analysis of Khrushchev's years in power, &quot;political terror as an everyday method of government was replaced under Khrushchev by administrative means of repression&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1978|pp=41–42}}In 1958, Khrushchev opened a Central Committee meeting to hundreds of Soviet officials; some were even allowed to address the meeting</span>
				<span class='text'>For the first time, the proceedings of the Committee were made public in book form, a practice which was continued at subsequent meetings</span>
				<span class='text'>This openness, however, actually allowed Khrushchev greater control over the Committee, since any dissenters would have to make their case in front of a large, disapproving crowd</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=198–199}}In 1962, Khrushchev divided ''oblast'' (province) level Party committees into two parallel structures, one for industry and one for agriculture</span>
				<span class='text'>This was unpopular among Party ''[[apparatchik]]s'', and led to confusions in the chain of command, as neither committee secretary had precedence over the other</span>
				<span class='text'>As there were limited numbers of Central Committee seats from each ''oblast'', the division set up the possibility of rivalry for office between factions, and, according to Medvedev, had the potential for beginning a two-party system</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1978|pp=154–157}} Khrushchev also ordered that one-third of the membership of each committee, from low-level councils to the Central Committee itself, be replaced at each election</span>
				<span class='text'>This decree created tension between Khrushchev and the Central Committee{{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1978|p=153}} and upset the party leaders upon whose support Khrushchev had risen to power</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Whitman|1971}}==== Agricultural policy ====Since the 1940s, Khrushchev had advocated the cultivation of corn ([[maize]]) in the Soviet Union</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=374}} He established a corn institute in Ukraine and ordered thousands of acres to be planted with corn in the [[Virgin Lands Campaign|Virgin Lands]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Carlson|2009|p=205}} In February 1955, Khrushchev gave a speech in which he advocated an [[Iowa]]-style corn belt in the Soviet Union, and a Soviet delegation visited the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>state that summer</span>

				<span class='text'>At the time, the main agricultural college in the USSR was in Moscow, and students did not do the manual labor of farming</span>
				<span class='text'>Khrushchev proposed to move the programs to rural areas</span>

				<span class='text'>It's a venerable old institution, a large economic unit, with skilled instructors, but it's in the city! Its students aren't yearning to work on the collective farms because to do that they'd have to go out in the provinces and live in the sticks</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Khrushchev|2007|p=154}}Khrushchev founded several academic towns, such as [[Akademgorodok]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The premier believed that Western science flourished because many scientists lived in university towns such as [[Oxford]], isolated from big city distractions, and had pleasant living conditions and good pay</span>
				<span class='text'>He sought to duplicate those conditions in the Soviet Union</span>
				<span class='text'>Khrushchev's attempt was generally successful, though his new towns and scientific centers tended to attract younger scientists, with older ones unwilling to leave Moscow or Leningrad</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1978|p=108}}Khrushchev also proposed to restructure Soviet high schools</span>
				<span class='text'>While the high schools provided a college preparatory curriculum, in fact few Soviet youths went on to university</span>
				<span class='text'>Khrushchev wanted to shift the focus of secondary schools to vocational training: students would spend much of their time at factory jobs or in apprenticeships and only a small part at the schools</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=192–193}} In practice, what occurred is that schools developed links with nearby enterprises, and students went to work for only one or two days a week; the factories and other works disliked having to teach, while students and their families complained that they had little choice in what trade to learn</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=193}}While the vocational proposal would not survive Khrushchev's downfall, a longer-lasting change was a related establishment of specialized high schools for gifted students or those wishing to study a specific subject</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Kelly|2007|p=147}} These schools were modeled after the foreign-language schools that had been established in Moscow and Leningrad beginning in 1949</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Laurent|2009}} In 1962, a special summer school was established in [[Novosibirsk]] to prepare students for a Siberian math and science Olympiad</span>

				<span class='text'>Other such schools were soon established in Moscow, Leningrad, and Kiev</span>
