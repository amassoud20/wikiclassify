				<span class='text'>His [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] theories, military strategies, and political policies are collectively known as [[Marxism–Leninism–Maoism]] or [[Maoism|Mao Zedong Thought]]</span>
				<span class='text'>orn the son of a wealthy farmer in [[Shaoshan]], [[Hunan]], Mao adopted a [[Chinese nationalism|Chinese nationalist]] and [[anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] outlook in early life, particularly influenced by the events of the [[Xinhai Revolution]] of 1911 and [[May Fourth Movement]] of 1919</span>
				<span class='text'>Mao converted to Marxism–Leninism while working at [[Peking University]] and became a founding member of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), leading the [[Autumn Harvest Uprising]] in 1927</span>
				<span class='text'>During the [[Chinese Civil War]] between the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) and the CPC, Mao helped to found the [[History of the People's Liberation Army#From the founding of the People's Liberation Army to the Korean War|Red Army]], led the [[Jiangxi Soviet]]'s radical land policies and ultimately became head of the CPC during the [[Long March]]</span>

				<span class='text'>n October 1, 1949, Mao proclaimed the foundation of the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC), a [[one-party state]] controlled by the CPC</span>
				<span class='text'>In the following years Mao solidified his control through [[land reform]] campaigns against landlords, and perceived enemies of the state he termed as &quot;[[Counter-revolutionary|counter-revolutionaries]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1957 he launched a campaign known as the [[Great Leap Forward]] that aimed to rapidly transform China's economy from an [[Agrarian society|agrarian]] economy to an [[Industrial society|industrial]] one, which led to a [[Great Chinese Famine|widespread famine]] whose death toll is estimated at between 18 and 45 million</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1966, he initiated the [[Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution]], a program to remove &quot;counter-revolutionary&quot; elements of Chinese society that lasted 10 years and which was marked by violent class struggle, widespread destruction of cultural artifacts and unprecedented elevation of Mao's [[personality cult]]</span>

				<span class='text'>A battalion led by General [[Zhu De]] was ordered to take the city of [[Nanchang]] on August 1, 1927 in what became known as the [[Nanchang Uprising]]; initially successful, they were forced into retreat after five days, marching south to [[Shantou]], and from there being driven into the wilderness of [[Fujian]]</span>

				<span class='text'>On the eve of the attack, Mao composed a poem—the earliest of his to survive—titled &quot;Changsha&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>His plan was to attack the KMT-held city from three directions on September 9, but the Fourth Regiment deserted to the KMT cause, attacking the Third Regiment</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jung Chang and Jon Halliday, ''Mao: The Unknown Story'', Random House 2005</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Chang and Halliday claim that the uprising was in fact sabotaged by Mao to allow him to snare a force of Nationalist mutineers from Nanchang who were crossing over to the CPC, prevent them from defecting to any other CPC leader, and enhance his own personal power within the CPC</span>
				<span class='text'>They claim that Mao's three-day delay in seeing the other leaders of the Hunan uprising, scheduled for August 15 but delayed by Mao until August 18, was to allow Mao to check that the mutineers would still be passing close by and that if Mao had not had the opportunity of adding this force to his own forces within the CPC he would not have gone to south Hunan</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ChangHalliday&quot;&gt;Chang, Halliday; Mao, Chapt</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt;Chang and Halliday also claim that Mao lobbied to narrow down the uprising and talked the other leaders (including Russian diplomats at the Soviet consulate in Changsha who, Chang and Halliday claim, had been controlling much of the CPC activity) into striking only at Changsha</span>
				<span class='text'>This, they say, was in order to allow Mao to also gain control of a force of 1,700 peasant rebels and defectors from the Nationalist army who were near Changsha</span>
				<span class='text'>Chang and Halliday point out that once Mao had gained control of these men, he then moved to a position 100&amp;nbsp;km east of Changsha at Wenjiashi and was there on September 11, the uprising's launch date, far from his troops, and that on September 14, before the troops had reached Changsha or met heavy resistance, Mao ordered them to abandon the assault on Changsha and converge on his position</span>
				<span class='text'>Chang and Halliday report a view sent to Moscow by the secretary of the Soviet Consulate in Changsha that the retreat was &quot;the most despicable treachery and cowardice</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ChangHalliday&quot; /&gt;Chang and Halliday allege that Mao later fabricated the version of events in order to hide the fact that far from leading a peasant uprising, he hijacked it for his own personal ends, sabotaged the organisation, and departed with the new troops before the attack on Changsha had begun</span>

				<span class='text'>Chang interviewed an eye witness to the crossing of the Dadu (Tatu) River at Luding, Mrs Zhu De, then 93 years old, who recalled no deaths, except for two people who fell from the bridge at Luding while repairing it</span>
				<span class='text'>Chang also points out the contradictions in the version of events as told by the CPC, which said the bridge was taken by a suicide attack by 22 men, but that these men were also present at a ceremony following the crossing of the bridge</span>

				<span class='text'>13&lt;/ref&gt;Chang and Halliday also dispute the Communist Party of China's official version by claiming that far from the Long March being a masterful piece of strategy by the CPC, it was in fact devised by Chiang Kai-shek, leader of the KMT</span>
				<span class='text'>Chiang's aim was to give the CPC an easy route to follow through warlord controlled areas</span>
				<span class='text'>Hemmed in by Nationalist troops on three sides, the CPC was forced to follow the route dictated by the KMT</span>
				<span class='text'>The aim of this was to allow KMT forces to follow the reds into warlord controlled areas such as Sichuan and win over warlords scared of the sudden arrival of the Communist force</span>
				<span class='text'>The only glitch in this plan came when Mao refused to follow the easy route into Sichuan where he was to meet up with a red army much larger than his own and led by a more senior CPC member, Chang Kuo Tao</span>
				<span class='text'>Mao recognised the threat Chang posed to his rising position in the CPC and doubled back to give himself time to further cement his political power, causing the needless deaths of thousands of his own troops</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ChangHalliday_a&quot; /&gt;Chang and Halliday also claim that Mao and other top CPC leaders did not walk the Long March, but were carried on litters&amp;nbsp;– Mao himself told his staff that being carried on the Long March gave him much time to read – with the litter bearers' knees being worn to the bone when forced to carry Mao up mountains</span>

				<span class='text'>The plan aimed to end Chinese dependence upon agriculture in order to become a world power</span>
				<span class='text'>With the [[Soviet Union]]'s assistance, new industrial plants were built and agricultural production eventually fell to a point where industry was beginning to produce enough capital that China no longer needed the USSR's support</span>

				<span class='text'>Mao also launched a phase of rapid [[collectivization]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The CPC introduced price controls as well as a [[Simplified Chinese character|Chinese character simplification]] aimed at increasing literacy</span>
				<span class='text'>Large-scale industrialization projects were also undertaken</span>
				<span class='text'>rograms pursued during this time include the [[Hundred Flowers Campaign]], in which Mao indicated his supposed willingness to consider different opinions about how China should be governed</span>
				<span class='text'>Given the freedom to express themselves, liberal and intellectual Chinese began opposing the Communist Party and questioning its leadership</span>
				<span class='text'>This was initially tolerated and encouraged</span>
				<span class='text'>After a few months, Mao's government reversed its policy and persecuted those, totalling perhaps {{formatnum:500000}},{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} who criticised, as well as those who were merely alleged to have criticised, the party in what is called the [[Anti-Rightist Movement]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Authors such as [[Jung Chang]] have alleged that the Hundred Flowers Campaign was merely a ruse to root out &quot;dangerous&quot; thinking</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chang|Halliday|2005|p=410}}&lt;/ref&gt;Li Zhisui, Mao's physician, suggested that Mao had initially seen the policy as a way of weakening those within his party who opposed him and was surprised by the extent of criticism and the fact that it began to be directed at his own leadership</span>

				<span class='text'>Under this economic program, the relatively small agricultural collectives which had been formed to date were rapidly merged into far larger [[people's commune]]s, and many of the peasants were ordered to work on massive infrastructure projects and on the production of iron and steel</span>
				<span class='text'>Some private food production was banned; livestock and farm implements were brought under collective ownership</span>
				<span class='text'>nder the Great Leap Forward, Mao and other party leaders ordered the implementation of a variety of unproven and unscientific new agricultural techniques by the new communes</span>
				<span class='text'>Combined with the diversion of labour to steel production and infrastructure projects, these projects combined with cyclical [[natural disasters]] led to an approximately 15% drop in grain production in 1959 followed by a further 10% decline in 1960 and no recovery in 1961</span>

				<span class='text'>Based upon the fabricated success, party cadres were ordered to requisition a disproportionately high amount of the true harvest for state use, primarily in the cities and urban areas but also for export</span>
				<span class='text'>The net result, which was compounded in some areas by drought and in others by floods, left rural peasants with little food for themselves and many millions starved to death in the largest [[famine]] known as the [[Great Chinese Famine]]</span>

				<span class='text'>rg/6196|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In the article &quot;Mao Zedong and the Famine of 1959–1960: A Study in Wilfulness&quot;, published in 2006 in ''[[The China Quarterly]]'', Professor Thomas P</span>
				<span class='text'>Bernstein also discussed Mao's change of attitudes during different phases of the Great Leap Forward:&lt;blockquote&gt;In late autumn 1958, Mao Zedong strongly condemned widespread practices of the Great Leap Forward (GLF) such as subjecting peasants to exhausting labour without adequate food and rest, which had resulted in epidemics, starvation and deaths</span>
				<span class='text'>At that time Mao explicitly recognized that anti-rightist pressures on officialdom were a major cause of &quot;production at the expense of livelihood</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; While he was not willing to acknowledge that only abandonment of the GLF could solve these problems, he did strongly demand that they be addressed</span>
				<span class='text'>After the July 1959 [[Lushan Conference|clash at Lushan]] with [[Peng Dehuai]], Mao revived the GLF in the context of a new, extremely harsh anti-rightist campaign, which he relentlessly promoted into the spring of 1960 together with the radical policies that he previously condemned</span>
				<span class='text'>Not until spring 1960 did Mao again express concern about abnormal deaths and other abuses, but he failed to apply the pressure needed to stop them</span>
				<span class='text'>Given what he had already learned about the costs to the peasants of GLF extremism, the Chairman should have known that the revival of GLF radicalism would exact a similar or even bigger price</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, he wilfully ignored the lessons of the first radical phase for the sake of achieving extreme ideological and developmental goals</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;wilfulness&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In ''[[Hungry Ghosts: Mao's Secret Famine]]'', [[Jasper Becker]] notes that Mao was dismissive of reports he received of food shortages in the countryside and refused to change course, believing that peasants were lying and that [[rightists]] and [[kulaks]] were hoarding grain</span>
				<span class='text'>He refused to open state granaries,&lt;ref name=&quot;Becker81&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Becker|1998|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; and instead launched a series of &quot;anti-grain concealment&quot; drives that resulted in numerous purges and suicides</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Becker|1998|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other violent campaigns followed in which party leaders went from village to village in search of hidden food reserves, and not only grain, as Mao issued quotas for pigs, chickens, ducks and eggs</span>
				<span class='text'>Many peasants accused of hiding food were tortured and beaten to death</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Becker|1998|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;Whatever the case, the Great Leap Forward caused Mao to lose esteem among many of the top party cadres and was eventually forced to abandon the policy in 1962, while losing some political power to moderate leaders, perhaps most notably [[Liu Shaoqi]] and [[Deng Xiaoping]] in the process</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Mao, supported by national propaganda, claimed that he was only partly to blame for the famine in China</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, he was able to remain Chairman of the Communist Party, with the Presidency transferred to Liu Shaoqi</span>
				<span class='text'>he Great Leap Forward was a tragedy for the vast majority of the Chinese</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the steel quotas were officially reached, almost all of the supposed steel made in the countryside was iron, as it had been made from assorted scrap metal in home-made furnaces with no reliable source of fuel such as coal</span>
				<span class='text'>This meant that proper [[smelting]] conditions could not be achieved</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Zhang Rongmei, a geometry teacher in rural Shanghai during the Great Leap Forward:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;We took all the furniture, pots, and pans we had in our house, and all our neighbours did likewise</span>
				<span class='text'>We put everything in a big fire and melted down all the metal</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The worst of the famine was steered towards enemies of the state</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Valentino|2004|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Jasper Becker]] explains:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The most vulnerable section of China's population, around five per cent, were those whom Mao called '[[enemies of the people]]'</span>
				<span class='text'>Anyone who had in previous campaigns of repression been labeled a 'black element' was given the lowest priority in the allocation of food</span>
				<span class='text'>Landlords, rich peasants, former members of the nationalist regime, religious leaders, rightists, counter-revolutionaries and the families of such individuals died in the greatest numbers</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;''&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Becker|1998|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;At a large Communist Party conference in Beijing in January 1962, called the &quot;Conference of the Seven Thousand&quot;, State Chairman Liu Shaoqi denounced the Great Leap Forward as responsible for widespread famine</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Chang&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Chang|Halliday|2005|pp=568, 579}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overwhelming majority of delegates expressed agreement, but Defense Minister [[Lin Biao]] staunchly defended Mao</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Chang&quot;/&gt; A brief period of liberalization followed while Mao and Lin plotted a comeback</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Chang&quot;/&gt; Liu Shaoqi and [[Deng Xiaoping]] rescued the economy by disbanding the people's communes, introducing elements of private control of peasant smallholdings and importing grain from Canada and Australia to mitigate the worst effects of famine</span>

				<span class='text'>]===Consequences===At the [[Lushan Conference]] in July/August 1959, several ministers expressed concern that the Great Leap Forward had not proved as successful as planned</span>
				<span class='text'>The most direct of these was Minister of Defence and [[Korean War]] veteran General [[Peng Dehuai]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Following Peng's criticism of the Great Leap Forward, Mao orchestrated a purge of Peng and his supporters, stifling criticism of the Great Leap policies</span>
				<span class='text'>Senior officials who reported the truth of the famine to Mao were branded as &quot;right opportunists</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Becker|1998|pp=92–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; A campaign against right-wing opportunism was launched and resulted in party members and ordinary peasants being sent to prison labor camps where many would subsequently die in the famine</span>
				<span class='text'>Years later the CPC would conclude that as many as six million people were wrongly punished in the campaign</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Valentino|2004|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;The number of deaths by starvation during the Great Leap Forward is deeply controversial</span>
				<span class='text'>Until the mid-1980s, when official census figures were finally published by the Chinese Government, little was known about the scale of the disaster in the Chinese countryside, as the handful of Western observers allowed access during this time had been restricted to model villages where they were deceived into believing that the Great Leap Forward had been a great success</span>
				<span class='text'>There was also an assumption that the flow of individual reports of starvation that had been reaching the West, primarily through Hong Kong and Taiwan, must have been localised or exaggerated as China was continuing to claim record harvests and was a net exporter of grain through the period</span>
				<span class='text'>Because Mao wanted to pay back early to the Soviets debts totalling 1</span>
				<span class='text'>73 billion [[Chinese yuan|yuan]] from 1960 to 1962,&lt;ref name=&quot;Yang Jisheng&quot;/&gt; exports increased by 50%, and fellow Communist regimes in [[North Korea]], [[North Vietnam]] and [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania|Albania]] were provided grain free of charge</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Becker81&quot;/&gt;Censuses were carried out in China in 1953, 1964 and 1982</span>
				<span class='text'>The first attempt to analyse this data to estimate the number of famine deaths was carried out by American demographer Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Judith Banister and published in 1984</span>
				<span class='text'>Given the lengthy gaps between the censuses and doubts over the reliability of the data, an accurate figure is difficult to ascertain</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, Banister concluded that the official data implied that around 15 million excess deaths incurred in China during 1958–61, and that based on her modelling of Chinese demographics during the period and taking account of assumed under-reporting during the famine years, the figure was around 30 million</span>

				<span class='text'>But as fresh and abundant archival evidence shows, coercion, terror and systematic violence were the foundation of the Great Leap, and between 1958 to 1962, by a rough approximation, some 6 to 8 per cent of those who died were tortured to death or summarily killed—amounting to at least 3 million victims</span>
				<span class='text'>ountless others were deliberately deprived of food and consequently starved to death</span>

				<span class='text'>And all of them shared an ideology in which the end justified the means</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1962, having lost millions of people in his province, [[Li Jingquan]] compared the Great Leap Forward to the [[Long March]] in which only one in ten had made it to the end: 'We are not weak, we are stronger, we have kept the backbone</span>
