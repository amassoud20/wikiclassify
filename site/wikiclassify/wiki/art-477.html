				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The theory proposes that most evolution is marked by long periods of evolutionary stability, which is punctuated by rare instances of [[Cladogenesis|branching evolution]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The theory was contrasted against [[phyletic gradualism]], the popular idea that evolutionary change is marked by a pattern of smooth and continuous change in the fossil record</span>
				<span class='text'>ost of Gould's empirical research was based on the [[land snail]] genera ''[[Poecilozonites]]'' and ''[[Cerion (gastropod)|Cerion]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>He also contributed to [[evolutionary developmental biology]], and has received wide praise for his book ''[[Ontogeny and Phylogeny (book)|Ontogeny and Phylogeny]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>In evolutionary theory he opposed strict selectionism, [[sociobiology]] as applied to humans, and [[evolutionary psychology]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He campaigned against [[creationism]] and proposed that science and religion should be considered two distinct fields (or &quot;[[Non-overlapping magisteria|magisteria]]&quot;) whose authorities do not overlap</span>

				<span class='text'>Somebody asked him: &quot;Suppose you die and your soul goes up there and it turns out the conventional story is true after all?&quot; Darrow's answer was beautiful, and I love the way he pictured it with the 12 apostles in the jury box and with his reputation for giving long speeches (he spoke two straight days to save [[Leopold and Loeb]])</span>
				<span class='text'>He said that for once in his life he wasn't going to make a long speech</span>
				<span class='text'>He was just going to walk up to them, bow low to the judge's bench, and say, &quot;Gentlemen, I was wrong</span>

				<span class='text'>After a difficult two-year recovery, Gould published a column for ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]'' magazine, entitled, &quot;The Median Isn't the Message&quot;, which discusses his reaction to discovering that people with mesothelioma had a [[median]] lifespan of only eight months after diagnosis</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He then describes the true significance behind this number, and his relief upon realizing that [[statistics|statistical averages]] are just useful abstractions, and do not encompass the full range of variation</span>
				<span class='text'>he median is the halfway point, which means that 50% of people will die before eight months, but the other half will live longer, potentially much longer</span>
				<span class='text'>He then needed to determine where his personal characteristics placed him within this range</span>
				<span class='text'>Given that the cancer was detected early, the fact he was young, optimistic, and had the best treatments available, Gould concluded that he should be in the favorable half of the [[Skewness|upper statistical range]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After an experimental treatment of [[Radiation therapy|radiation]], chemotherapy, and surgery, Gould made a full recovery, and his column became a source of comfort for many people with cancer</span>
				<span class='text'>ould was also an advocate of [[medical cannabis|medical marijuana]]</span>
				<span class='text'>When he had cancer, he smoked the drug to alleviate the nausea associated with his medical treatments</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Gould, his use of [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] had a &quot;most important effect&quot; on his eventual recovery</span>

				<span class='text'>Rather the spaces arise as &quot;necessary architectural byproducts of mounting a dome on rounded arches</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Gould and Lewontin thus defined &quot;[[spandrel (biology)|spandrels]]&quot; in the evolutionary biology context, to mean any biological feature of an organism that arises as a necessary side consequence of other features, which is not directly selected for by natural selection</span>

				<span class='text'>Gould argued that evolution's drive was not towards [[complexity]], but towards [[biodiversity|diversification]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Because life is constrained to begin with a [[abiogenesis|simple starting point]] (like bacteria), any diversity resulting from this start, by random walk, will have a skewed distribution and therefore be perceived to move in the direction of higher complexity</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|249px|Drawing of a ''Cerion'' snail]]Most of Gould's empirical research pertained to [[land snails]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He focused his early work on the [[Bermuda|Bermudian]] genus [[Bermuda Land Snail|''Poecilozonites'']], while his later work concentrated on the [[Caribbean|West Indian]] genus ''[[Cerion (gastropod)|Cerion]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Gould &quot;''Cerion'' is the land snail of maximal diversity in form throughout the entire world</span>
				<span class='text'>There are 600 described species of this single genus</span>
				<span class='text'>In fact, they're not really species, they all interbreed, but the names exist to express a real phenomenon which is this incredible morphological diversity</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Now my main subject is the evolution of form, and the problem of how it is that you can get this diversity amid so little genetic difference, so far as we can tell, is a very interesting one</span>
				<span class='text'>And if we could solve this we'd learn something general about the evolution of form</span>

				<span class='text'>A recurring theme in his writings is the history and development of pre-evolutionary and [[History of evolutionary thought|evolutionary thought]]</span>

				<span class='text'>In contrast, the evolutionary biologists with whom I have discussed his work tend to see him as a man whose ideas are so confused as to be hardly worth bothering with, but as one who should not be publicly criticized because he is at least on our side against the creationists</span>

				<span class='text'>the supposed conflict between science and religion</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=RoA&gt;Gould, S</span>

				<span class='text'>New York: Ballantine Books</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He defines the term ''magisterium'' as &quot;a domain where one form of teaching holds the appropriate tools for meaningful discourse and resolution</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=RoA/&gt; The non-overlapping magisteria (NOMA) principle therefore divides the magisterium of science to cover &quot;the empirical realm: what the Universe is made of (fact) and why does it work in this way (theory)</span>
				<span class='text'>The magisterium of religion extends over questions of ultimate meaning and moral value</span>
				<span class='text'>These two magisteria do not overlap, nor do they encompass all inquiry</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=RoA /&gt; He suggests that &quot;NOMA enjoys strong and fully explicit support, even from the primary cultural stereotypes of hard-line traditionalism&quot; and that NOMA is &quot;a sound position of general consensus, established by long struggle among people of goodwill in both magisteria</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=RoA/&gt;However, this view has not been without criticism</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, in his book ''[[The God Delusion]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]] argues that the division between religion and science is not as simple as Gould claims, as few religions exist without claiming the existence of [[miracle]]s, which &quot;by definition, violate the principles of science</span>

				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins also opposes the idea that religion has anything meaningful to say about ethics and values, and therefore has no authority to claim a [[magisterium]] of its own</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;DawkinsTGD&quot;/&gt; He goes on to say that he believes Gould is disingenuous in much of what he says in ''[[Rocks of Ages]]''</span>
