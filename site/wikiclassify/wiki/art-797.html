				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date = June 2015}}Spock advocated ideas about parenting that were, at the time, considered out of the mainstream</span>
				<span class='text'>Over time, his books helped to bring about major change</span>
				<span class='text'>Previously, experts{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} had told parents that babies needed to learn to sleep on a regular schedule, and that picking them up and holding them whenever they cried would only teach them to cry more and not to sleep through the night (a notion that borrows from [[behaviorism]])</span>
				<span class='text'>They were told{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} to feed their children on a regular schedule, and that they should not pick them up, kiss them, or hug them, because that would not prepare them to be strong and independent individuals in a harsh world</span>
				<span class='text'>Spock encouraged parents to see their children as individuals, and not to apply a one-size-fits all philosophy to them</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date = June 2015}}By the late 1960s however, Spock's public opposition to the Vietnam War would prove to have a damaging effect on his career</span>
				<span class='text'> It was reported that the 1968 revision of Baby and Child Care had sold half of what the previous edition sold</span>

				<span class='text'>Spock on Vietnam&quot; and co-wrote an autobiography entitled &quot;Spock on Spock&quot; (with Mary Morgan Spock), in which he stated his attitude toward aging: &quot;Delay and Deny&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date = June 2015}}In the seventh edition of ''Baby and Child Care,'' published a few weeks after he died, Spock advocated for a bold change in children's diets, recommending that all children switch to a [[vegan]] diet after the age of 2</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Spock himself had switched to an all-plant diet in 1991, after a series of illnesses that left him weak and unable to walk unaided</span>
				<span class='text'>After making the dietary change, he lost 50 pounds, regained his ability to walk and became healthier overall</span>
				<span class='text'>The revised edition stated children on an all-plant diet will reduce their risk of developing heart disease, obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes and certain diet-related cancers</span>
				<span class='text'>Several studies have shown that, in general, vegetarians are leaner and at lower risk of such diseases</span>
				<span class='text'>The approach to childhood nutrition was criticized by a number of experts, including his co-author, Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Steven J</span>
				<span class='text'>Parker, as too extreme and likely to result in nutritional deficiencies unless it is very carefully planned and executed, something that would be difficult for working parents</span>

				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date = June 2015}}==Views=====Sudden infant death syndrome===Spock advocated that infants should not be placed on their back when sleeping, commenting in his 1958 edition that &quot;if [an infant] vomits, he's more likely to choke on the vomitus</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; This advice was extremely influential on health-care providers, with nearly unanimous support through to the 1990s</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Later empirical studies, however, found that there is a significantly increased risk of [[sudden infant death syndrome]] (SIDS) associated with infants sleeping on their abdomens</span>
				<span class='text'> Advocates of [[evidence-based medicine]] have used this as an example of the importance of basing health-care recommendations on statistical evidence, with one researcher estimating that as many as 50,000 infant deaths in Europe, Australia, and the US could have been prevented had this advice been altered by 1970, when such evidence became available</span>

				<span class='text'>Spock himself, in his autobiography, pointed out that he had never advocated permissiveness; also, that the attacks and claims that he had ruined American youth only arose after his public opposition to the Vietnam war</span>
				<span class='text'>He regarded these claims as [[ad hominem]] attacks, whose political motivation and nature were clear</span>

				<span class='text'>'&lt;blockquote&gt;The Permissive Label: A couple weeks after my indictment [for 'conspiracy to counsel, aid and abet resistance to the military draft'], I was accused by Reverend Norman Vincent Peale, a well-known clergyman and author who supported the Vietnam War, of corrupting an entire generation</span>
				<span class='text'>In a sermon widely reported in the press, Reverend Peale blamed ''me'' for all the lack of patriotism, lack of responsibility, and lack of discipline of the young people who opposed the war</span>
				<span class='text'>All these failings, he said, were due to my having told their parents to give them &quot;instant gratification&quot; as babies</span>
				<span class='text'>I was showered with blame in dozens of editorials and columns from primarily conservative newspapers all over the country heartily agreeing with Peale's assertions</span>
				<span class='text'>any parents have since stopped me on the street or in airports to thank me for helping them to raise fine children, and they've often added, &quot;I don't see any instant gratification in ''Baby and Child Care''&quot; I answer that they're right--I've always advised parents to give their children firm, clear leadership and to ask for cooperation and politeness in return</span>
				<span class='text'>On the other hand I've also received letters from conservative mothers saying, in effect, &quot;Thank God I've never used your horrible book</span>
				<span class='text'>That's why my children take baths, wear clean clothes and get good grades in school</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{citation needed|date = June 2015}}Since I received the first accusation twenty-two years after ''Baby and Child Care'' was originally published--and since those who write about how harmful my book is invariably assure me they've never used it--I think it's clear that the hostility is to my politics rather than my pediatric advice</span>
				<span class='text'>And though I've been denying the accusation for twenty-five years, one of the first questions I get from many reporters and interviewers is, &quot;Doctor Spock, are you still permissive?&quot; You can't catch up with a false accusation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/blockquote&gt;The negative perceptions continued into the 21st Century</span>
