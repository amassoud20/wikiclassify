				<span class='text'>He had two younger sisters: Anna Maria and Maria Magdalena</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon after the birth of Leonhard, the Eulers moved from Basel to the town of [[Riehen]], where Euler spent most of his childhood</span>
				<span class='text'>Paul Euler was a friend of the [[Bernoulli family]]; [[Johann Bernoulli]], was then regarded as Europe's foremost mathematician, and would eventually be the most important influence on young Leonhard</span>
				<span class='text'>uler's formal education started in Basel, where he was sent to live with his maternal grandmother</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1720, aged thirteen, he enrolled at the [[University of Basel]], and in 1723, he received a Master of Philosophy with a dissertation that compared the philosophies of [[René Descartes|Descartes]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]</span>
				<span class='text'>At that time, he was receiving Saturday afternoon lessons from Johann Bernoulli, who quickly discovered his new pupil's incredible talent for mathematics</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;childhood&quot;/&gt; At that time Euler's main studies included theology, [[Greek language|Greek]], and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] at his father's urging in order to become a pastor, but Bernoulli convinced his father that Leonhard was destined to become a great mathematician</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1726, Euler completed a dissertation on the [[Speed of sound|propagation of sound]] with the title ''De Sono''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=17cent/&gt; At that time, he was unsuccessfully attempting to obtain a position at the University of Basel</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1727, he first entered the ''[[French Academy of Sciences|Paris Academy]] Prize Problem'' competition; the problem that year was to find the best way to place the [[mast (sailing)|masts]] on a ship</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Pierre Bouguer]], who became known as &quot;the father of naval architecture&quot;, won and Euler took second place</span>
				<span class='text'>Euler later won this annual prize twelve times</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;prize&quot;/&gt;===Saint Petersburg===Around this time Johann Bernoulli's two sons, [[Daniel Bernoulli|Daniel]] and [[Nicolaus II Bernoulli|Nicolas]], were working at the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Imperial Russian Academy of Sciences]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]</span>
				<span class='text'>On 10 July 1726, Nicolas died of [[appendicitis]] after spending a year in Russia, and when Daniel assumed his brother's position in the mathematics/physics division, he recommended that the post in physiology that he had vacated be filled by his friend Euler</span>
				<span class='text'>In November 1726 Euler eagerly accepted the offer, but delayed making the trip to Saint Petersburg while he unsuccessfully applied for a physics professorship at the University of Basel</span>

				<span class='text'>The text says: 250 years from the birth of the great mathematician, academician Leonhard Euler</span>
				<span class='text'>]Euler arrived in Saint Petersburg on 17 May 1727</span>
				<span class='text'>He was promoted from his junior post in the medical department of the academy to a position in the mathematics department</span>
				<span class='text'>He lodged with Daniel Bernoulli with whom he often worked in close collaboration</span>
				<span class='text'>Euler mastered Russian and settled into life in Saint Petersburg</span>
				<span class='text'>He also took on an additional job as a medic in the [[Russian Navy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;medic&quot;/&gt;The Academy at Saint Petersburg, established by [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]], was intended to improve education in Russia and to close the scientific gap with Western Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, it was made especially attractive to foreign scholars like Euler</span>
				<span class='text'>The academy possessed ample financial resources and a comprehensive library drawn from the private libraries of Peter himself and of the nobility</span>
				<span class='text'>Very few students were enrolled in the academy in order to lessen the faculty's teaching burden, and the academy emphasized research and offered to its faculty both the time and the freedom to pursue scientific questions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;prize&quot;/&gt;The Academy's benefactress, [[Catherine I of Russia|Catherine I]], who had continued the progressive policies of her late husband, died on the day of Euler's arrival</span>
				<span class='text'>The Russian nobility then gained power upon the ascension of the twelve-year-old [[Peter II of Russia|Peter II]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The nobility were suspicious of the academy's foreign scientists, and thus cut funding and caused other difficulties for Euler and his colleagues</span>
				<span class='text'>onditions improved slightly after the death of Peter II, and Euler swiftly rose through the ranks in the academy and was made professor of physics in 1731</span>
				<span class='text'>Two years later, Daniel Bernoulli, who was fed up with the censorship and hostility he faced at Saint Petersburg, left for Basel</span>
				<span class='text'>Euler succeeded him as the head of the mathematics department</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;promotion&quot;/&gt;On 7 January 1734, he married Katharina Gsell (1707–1773), a daughter of [[Georg Gsell]], a painter from the Academy Gymnasium</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=gekker/&gt; The young couple bought a house by the [[Neva River]]</span>

				<span class='text'>]Concerned about the continuing turmoil in Russia, Euler left St</span>
				<span class='text'>Petersburg on 19 June 1741 to take up a post at the ''[[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy]]'', which he had been offered by [[Frederick the Great of Prussia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He lived for twenty-five years in [[Berlin]], where he wrote over 380 articles</span>
				<span class='text'>In Berlin, he published the two works for which he would become most renowned: The ''[[Introductio in analysin infinitorum]]'', a text on functions published in 1748, and the ''[[Institutiones calculi differentialis]]'',&lt;ref name=dartm/&gt; published in 1755 on [[differential calculus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Friedrich&quot;/&gt; In 1755, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n addition, Euler was asked to tutor [[Friederike Charlotte of Brandenburg-Schwedt]], the Princess of [[Anhalt-Dessau]] and Frederick's niece</span>
				<span class='text'>Euler wrote over 200 letters to her in the early 1760s, which were later compiled into a best-selling volume entitled ''[[Letters to a German Princess|Letters of Euler on different Subjects in Natural Philosophy Addressed to a German Princess]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name='Digital Copy of &quot;Letters to a German Princess&quot;'/&gt; This work contained Euler's exposition on various subjects pertaining to physics and mathematics, as well as offering valuable insights into Euler's personality and religious beliefs</span>
				<span class='text'>This book became more widely read than any of his mathematical works, and was published across Europe and in the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>The popularity of the 'Letters' testifies to Euler's ability to communicate scientific matters effectively to a lay audience, a rare ability for a dedicated research scientist</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Friedrich&quot;/&gt;Despite Euler's immense contribution to the Academy's prestige, he eventually incurred the ire of [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick]] and ended up having to leave Berlin</span>
				<span class='text'>The Prussian king had a large circle of intellectuals in his court and he found the mathematician unsophisticated and ill-informed on matters beyond numbers and figures</span>
				<span class='text'>Euler was a simple, devoutly religious man who never questioned the existing social order or conventional beliefs, in many ways the polar opposite of [[Voltaire]], who enjoyed a high place of prestige at Frederick's court</span>
				<span class='text'>Euler was not a skilled debater and often made it a point to argue subjects that he knew little about, making him the frequent target of Voltaire's wit</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Friedrich&quot;/&gt; Frederick also expressed disappointment with Euler's practical engineering abilities:{{quote|I wanted to have a water jet in my garden: Euler calculated the force of the wheels necessary to raise the water to a reservoir, from where it should fall back through channels, finally spurting out in [[Sanssouci]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;blind&quot;/&gt;]]===Eyesight deterioration===Euler's [[eyesight]] worsened throughout his mathematical career</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1738, three years after nearly expiring from fever, he became almost blind in his right eye, but Euler rather blamed the painstaking work on [[cartography]] he performed for the St</span>
				<span class='text'>Petersburg Academy for his condition</span>
				<span class='text'>Euler's vision in that eye worsened throughout his stay in Germany, to the extent that Frederick referred to him as &quot;[[Cyclops]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Euler later developed a [[cataract]] in his left eye, which was discovered in 1766</span>
				<span class='text'>Just a few weeks after its discovery, he was rendered almost totally blind</span>
				<span class='text'>However, his condition appeared to have little effect on his productivity, as he compensated for it with his mental calculation skills and exceptional memory</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, Euler could repeat the [[Aeneid]] of [[Virgil]] from beginning to end without hesitation, and for every page in the edition he could indicate which line was the first and which the last</span>
				<span class='text'>With the aid of his scribes, Euler's productivity on many areas of study actually increased</span>
				<span class='text'>He produced on average, one mathematical paper every week in the year 1775</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;volumes&quot;/&gt;===Return to Russia and death===In 1760, with the [[Seven Years' War]] raging, Euler's farm in Charlottenburg was ransacked by advancing Russian troops</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon learning of this event, [[Ivan Petrovich Saltykov|General Ivan Petrovich Saltykov]] paid compensation for the damage caused to Euler's estate, later [[Empress Elizabeth|Empress Elizabeth of Russia]] added a further payment of 4000 roubles - an exorbitant amount at the time</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The political situation in Russia stabilized after [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine the Great's]] accession to the throne, so in 1766 Euler accepted an invitation to return to the St</span>
				<span class='text'>Petersburg Academy</span>
				<span class='text'>His conditions were quite exorbitant – a 3000 ruble annual salary, a pension for his wife, and the promise of high-ranking appointments for his sons</span>
				<span class='text'>All of these requests were granted</span>
				<span class='text'>He spent the rest of his life in Russia</span>
				<span class='text'>However, his second stay in the country was marred by tragedy</span>
				<span class='text'>A fire in St</span>
				<span class='text'>Petersburg in 1771 cost him his home, and almost his life</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1773, he lost his wife Katharina after 40 years of marriage</span>
				<span class='text'>hree years after his wife's death, Euler married her half-sister, Salome Abigail Gsell (1723–1794)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=gekker2/&gt; This marriage lasted until his death</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1782 he was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Boyer/&gt; The use of the Greek letter ''[[pi (letter)|π]]'' to denote the [[pi|ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter]] was also popularized by Euler, although it did not originate with him</span>

				<span class='text'>Thanks to their influence, studying calculus became the major focus of Euler's work</span>
				<span class='text'>While some of Euler's proofs are not acceptable by modern standards of [[mathematical rigor|mathematical rigour]]&lt;ref name = &quot;Basel&quot;/&gt; (in particular his reliance on the principle of the [[generality of algebra]]), his ideas led to many great advances</span>
				<span class='text'>uler is well known in [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]] for his frequent use and development of [[power series]], the expression of functions as sums of infinitely many terms, such as:&lt;math&gt;e^x = \sum_{n=0}^\infty {x^n \over n!} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(\frac{1}{0!} + \frac{x}{1!} + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \cdots + \frac{x^n}{n!}\right)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/math&gt;Notably, Euler directly proved the power series expansions for {{math|''e''}} and the [[inverse tangent]] function</span>
				<span class='text'>(Indirect proof via the inverse power series technique was given by [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] between 1670 and 1680</span>
				<span class='text'> His daring use of power series enabled him to solve the famous [[Basel problem]] in 1735 (he provided a more elaborate argument in 1741):&lt;ref name=&quot;Basel&quot;/&gt;:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty {1 \over n^2} = \lim_{n \to \infty}\left(\frac{1}{1^2} + \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{3^2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n^2}\right) = \frac{\pi ^2}{6}</span>

				<span class='text'>,&lt;/math&gt;A special case of the above formula is known as [[Euler's identity]],:&lt;math&gt;e^{i \pi} +1 = 0 \, &lt;/math&gt;called &quot;the most remarkable formula in mathematics&quot; by [[Richard P</span>
				<span class='text'>Feynman]], for its single uses of the notions of addition, multiplication, exponentiation, and equality, and the single uses of the important constants 0, 1, {{math|''e''}}, {{math|''i''}} and {{pi}}</span>

				<span class='text'>n addition, Euler elaborated the theory of higher [[transcendental function]]s by introducing the [[gamma function]] and introduced a new method for solving [[quartic equation]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>He also found a way to calculate integrals with complex limits, foreshadowing the development of modern [[complex analysis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also invented the [[calculus of variations]] including its best-known result, the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]]</span>
				<span class='text'>uler also pioneered the use of analytic methods to solve number theory problems</span>
				<span class='text'>In doing so, he united two disparate branches of mathematics and introduced a new field of study, [[analytic number theory]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In breaking ground for this new field, Euler created the theory of [[Generalized hypergeometric series|hypergeometric series]], [[q-series]], [[hyperbolic functions|hyperbolic trigonometric functions]] and the analytic theory of [[generalized continued fraction|continued fractions]]</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, he proved the [[infinitude of primes]] using the divergence of the [[harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]], and he used analytic methods to gain some understanding of the way [[prime numbers]] are distributed</span>

				<span class='text'>In doing so, he discovered the connection between the [[Riemann zeta function]] and the prime numbers; this is known as the [[Proof of the Euler product formula for the Riemann zeta function|Euler product formula for the Riemann zeta function]]</span>
				<span class='text'>uler proved [[Newton's identities]], [[Fermat's little theorem]], [[Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares]], and he made distinct contributions to [[Lagrange's four-square theorem]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also invented the [[totient function]] φ(''n''), the number of positive integers less than or equal to the integer ''n'' that are [[coprime]] to ''n''</span>
				<span class='text'>Using properties of this function, he generalized Fermat's little theorem to what is now known as [[Euler's theorem]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He contributed significantly to the theory of [[perfect number]]s, which had fascinated mathematicians since [[Euclid]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He proved that the relationship shown between perfect numbers and [[Mersenne prime]]s earlier proved by Euclid was one-to-one, a result otherwise known as the [[Euclid–Euler theorem]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Euler also conjectured the law of [[quadratic reciprocity]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The concept is regarded as a fundamental theorem of number theory, and his ideas paved the way for the work of [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;numbertheory&quot;/&gt;By 1772 Euler had proved that 2&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 = [[2147483647|2,147,483,647]] is a Mersenne prime</span>
				<span class='text'>It may have remained the [[largest known prime]] until 1867</span>

				<span class='text'>ng|frame|right|Map of [[Königsberg]] in Euler's time showing the actual layout of the [[Seven Bridges of Königsberg|seven bridges]], highlighting the river Pregel and the bridges</span>
				<span class='text'>]In 1735, Euler presented a solution to the problem known as the [[Seven Bridges of Königsberg]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;bridge&quot;/&gt; The city of [[Königsberg]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] was set on the [[Pregel]] River, and included two large islands that were connected to each other and the mainland by seven bridges</span>
				<span class='text'>The problem is to decide whether it is possible to follow a path that crosses each bridge exactly once and returns to the starting point</span>
				<span class='text'>It is not possible: there is no [[Eulerian path|Eulerian circuit]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This solution is considered to be the first theorem of [[graph theory]], specifically of [[planar graph]] theory</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;bridge&quot;/&gt;Euler also discovered the [[Planar graph#Euler's formula|formula]] {{math|V}}&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;{{math|E}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{math|F}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 relating the number of vertices, edges and faces of a [[Convex polytope|convex polyhedron]],&lt;ref name=cromw/&gt; and hence of a [[planar graph]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The constant in this formula is now known as the [[Euler characteristic]] for the graph (or other mathematical object), and is related to the [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] of the object</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=gibbons/&gt; The study and generalization of this formula, specifically by [[Augustin Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Cauchy&quot;/&gt; and [[Simon Antoine Jean L'Huillier|L'Huillier]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Lhuillier&quot;/&gt; is at the origin of [[topology]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==Applied mathematics===Some of Euler's greatest successes were in solving real-world problems analytically, and in describing numerous applications of the [[Bernoulli numbers]], [[Fourier series]], [[Venn diagrams]], [[Euler number]]s, the constants [[E (mathematical constant)|{{math|e}}]] and [[pi|{{pi}}]], continued fractions and integrals</span>
				<span class='text'>He integrated [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s [[differential calculus]] with Newton's [[Method of Fluxions]], and developed tools that made it easier to apply calculus to physical problems</span>
				<span class='text'>He made great strides in improving the [[numerical approximation]] of integrals, inventing what are now known as the [[Euler approximations]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The most notable of these approximations are [[Euler's method]] and the [[Euler–Maclaurin formula]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also facilitated the use of [[differential equations]], in particular introducing the [[Euler–Mascheroni constant]]::&lt;math&gt;\gamma = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty } \left( 1+ \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n} - \ln(n) \right)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/math&gt;One of Euler's more unusual interests was the application of mathematical ideas in music</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1739 he wrote the ''Tentamen novae theoriae musicae,'' hoping to eventually incorporate [[musical theory]] as part of mathematics</span>
				<span class='text'>This part of his work, however, did not receive wide attention and was once described as too mathematical for musicians and too musical for mathematicians</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;music&quot;/&gt;===Physics and astronomy==={{Classical mechanics|cTopic=Scientists}}Euler helped develop the [[Euler–Bernoulli beam equation]], which became a cornerstone of engineering</span>
				<span class='text'>Aside from successfully applying his analytic tools to problems in [[classical mechanics]], Euler also applied these techniques to celestial problems</span>
				<span class='text'>His work in astronomy was recognized by a number of Paris Academy Prizes over the course of his career</span>
				<span class='text'>His accomplishments include determining with great accuracy the orbits of comets and other celestial bodies, understanding the nature of comets, and calculating the [[solar parallax|parallax]] of the sun</span>
				<span class='text'>His calculations also contributed to the development of accurate [[History of longitude|longitude tables]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=yousch/&gt;In addition, Euler made important contributions in [[optics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He disagreed with Newton's [[corpuscular theory of light]] in the ''[[Opticks]]'', which was then the prevailing theory</span>
				<span class='text'>His 1740s papers on optics helped ensure that the [[wave theory of light]] proposed by [[Christiaan Huygens]] would become the dominant mode of thought, at least until the development of the [[wave-particle duality|quantum theory of light]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;optics&quot;/&gt;In 1757 he published an important set of equations for [[inviscid flow]], that are now known as the [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=euler2/&gt; In differential form, the equations are::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}&amp;{\partial\rho\over\partial t}+\nabla\cdot(\rho\bold u)=0\\[1</span>

				<span class='text'>ex]&amp;{\partial E\over\partial t}+\nabla\cdot(\bold u(E+p))=0,\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;where* ''ρ'' is the fluid [[mass density]],* '''''u''''' is the fluid [[velocity]] [[Vector (geometric)|vector]], with components ''u'', ''v'', and ''w'',* ''E'' = ''ρ e'' + ½ ''ρ'' (''u''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''v''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''w''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is the total energy per unit [[volume]], with ''e'' being the [[internal energy]] per unit mass for the fluid,* ''p'' is the [[pressure]],* ''⊗'' denotes the [[tensor product]], and* '''0''' being the [[zero vector]]</span>
				<span class='text'>uler is also well known in structural engineering for his formula giving the critical [[buckling]] load of an ideal strut, which depends only on its length and flexural stiffness:&lt;ref name=&quot;SIAM&quot;/&gt;:&lt;math&gt;F=\frac{\pi^2 EI}{(KL)^2}&lt;/math&gt;where* ''F'' = maximum or critical [[force]] (vertical load on column),* ''E'' = [[modulus of elasticity]],* ''I'' = [[area moment of inertia]],* ''L'' = unsupported length of column,* ''K'' = column effective length factor, whose value depends on the conditions of end support of the column, as follows</span>
				<span class='text'>:For both ends pinned (hinged, free to rotate), ''K'' = 1</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>:For both ends fixed, ''K'' = 0</span>
				<span class='text'>0</span>
				<span class='text'>:For one end fixed and the other end pinned, ''K'' = 0</span>
				<span class='text'>99…::For one end fixed and the other end free to move laterally, ''K'' = 2</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> ''K L'' is the effective length of the column</span>
				<span class='text'>==Logic===Euler is also credited with using [[closed curve]]s to illustrate [[syllogism|syllogistic]] reasoning (1768)</span>
				<span class='text'>These diagrams have become known as [[Euler diagram]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;logic&quot;/&gt;[[File:Euler Diagram</span>
				<span class='text'>vg|thumb|169x169px|Euler's diagram]]An Euler diagram is a [[diagram]]matic means of representing [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] and their relationships</span>
				<span class='text'>Euler diagrams consist of simple closed curves (usually circles) in the plane that depict [[Set (mathematics)|sets]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Each Euler curve divides the plane into two regions or &quot;zones&quot;: the interior, which symbolically represents the [[element (mathematics)|elements]] of the set, and the exterior, which represents all elements that are not members of the set</span>
				<span class='text'> The sizes or shapes of the curves are not important: the significance of the diagram is in how they overlap</span>
				<span class='text'>The spatial relationships between the regions bounded by each curve (overlap, containment or neither) corresponds to set-theoretic relationships ([[intersection (set theory)|intersection]], [[subset]] and [[Disjoint sets|disjointness]])</span>
				<span class='text'>  Curves whose interior zones do not intersect represent [[disjoint sets]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Two curves whose interior zones intersect represent sets that have common elements; the zone inside both curves represents the set of elements common to both sets (the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of the sets)</span>
				<span class='text'> A curve that is contained completely within the interior zone of another represents a [[subset]] of it</span>
				<span class='text'>Euler diagrams were incorporated as part of instruction in [[set theory]] as part of the [[new math]] movement in the 1960s</span>
				<span class='text'>Since then, they have also been adopted by other curriculum fields such as reading</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=quest/&gt;===Music===Even when dealing with music, Euler’s approach is mainly mathematical</span>
				<span class='text'>His writings on music are not particularly numerous (a few hundred pages, in his total production of about thirty thousand pages), but they reflect an early preoccupation and one that did not leave him throughout his life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Peter Pesic, ''Music and the Making of Modern Science'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>133</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;A first point of Euler’s musical theory is the definition of &quot;genres&quot;, i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>of possible divisions of the octave using the prime numbers 3 and 5</span>
				<span class='text'>Euler describes 18 such genres, with the general definition 2&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;A, where A is the &quot;exponent&quot; of the genre (i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>the sum of the exponents of 3 and 5) and 2&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; (where &quot;m is an indefinite number, small or large, so long as the sounds are perceptible&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Leonhard Euler, ''Tentamen novae theoriae musicae'', St Petersburg, 1739, p</span>
				<span class='text'>115&lt;/ref&gt;), expresses that the relation holds independently of the number of octaves concerned</span>
				<span class='text'>The first genre, with A = 1, is the octave itself (or its duplicates); the second genre, 2&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'>, is the octave divided by the fifth (fifth + fourth, C–G–C); the third genre is 2&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'>, major third + minor sixth (C–E–C); the fourth is 2&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, two fourths and a tone (C–F–Bb–C); the fifth is 2&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> (C–E–G–B–C); etc</span>
				<span class='text'>Genres 12 (2&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'>), 13 (2&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and 14 (2&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) are corrected versions of the diatonic, chromatic and enharmonic, respectively, of the Ancients</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Personal philosophy and religious beliefs==Euler and his friend [[Daniel Bernoulli]] were opponents of [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz's]] [[monadism]] and the philosophy of [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Euler insisted that knowledge is founded in part on the basis of precise quantitative laws, something that monadism and Wolffian science were unable to provide</span>
				<span class='text'>Euler's religious leanings might also have had a bearing on his dislike of the doctrine; he went so far as to label Wolff's ideas as &quot;heathen and atheistic&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;wolff&quot;/&gt;Much of what is known of Euler's religious beliefs can be deduced from his ''Letters to a German Princess'' and an earlier work, ''Rettung der Göttlichen Offenbahrung Gegen die Einwürfe der Freygeister'' (''Defense of the Divine Revelation against the Objections of the Freethinkers'')</span>
				<span class='text'>These works show that Euler was a devout Christian who believed the Bible to be inspired; the ''Rettung'' was primarily an argument for the [[Biblical inspiration|divine inspiration of scripture]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;theology&quot;/&gt;There is a famous legend&lt;ref name=&quot;diderot&quot;/&gt; inspired by Euler's arguments with secular philosophers over religion, which is set during Euler's second stint at the St</span>
				<span class='text'>Petersburg academy</span>
				<span class='text'>The French philosopher [[Denis Diderot]] was visiting Russia on Catherine the Great's invitation</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the Empress was alarmed that the philosopher's arguments for [[atheism]] were influencing members of her court, and so Euler was asked to confront the Frenchman</span>
				<span class='text'>Diderot was informed that a learned mathematician had produced a proof of the [[existence of God]]: he agreed to view the proof as it was presented in court</span>
				<span class='text'>Euler appeared, advanced toward Diderot, and in a tone of perfect conviction announced this [[Non sequitur (literary device)|non-sequitur]]: &quot;Sir, {{sfrac|''a+b&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''|''n''}}=''x'', hence God exists—reply!&quot;Diderot, to whom (says the story) all mathematics was gibberish, stood dumbstruck as peals of laughter erupted from the court</span>
				<span class='text'> Embarrassed, he asked to leave Russia, a request that was graciously granted by the Empress</span>
				<span class='text'>However amusing the anecdote may be, it is [[wikt:apocryphal|apocryphal]], given that Diderot himself did research in mathematics</span>
