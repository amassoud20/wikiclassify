				<span class='text'>340{{spaced ndash}}4 April 397), was a [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milan|bishop of Milan]] who became one of the most influential ecclesiastical figures of the 4th century</span>
				<span class='text'>He was [[consular prefect]] of [[Liguria]] and [[Emilia (region of Italy)|Emilia]], headquartered in Milan, before being made bishop of Milan by popular acclamation in 374</span>
				<span class='text'>Ambrose was a staunch opponent of [[Arianism]], and has been accused of fostering persecutions of Arians, [[Jew]]s, and [[pagan]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>raditionally, Ambrose is credited with promoting &quot;antiphonal chant&quot;, a style of chanting in which one side of the choir responds alternately to the other, as well as with composing ''[[Veni redemptor gentium]]'', a [[Advent]] hymn</span>

				<span class='text'>Ambrose went to the church where the election was to take place, to prevent an uproar, which was probable in this crisis</span>
				<span class='text'>His address was interrupted by a call &quot;Ambrose, bishop!&quot;, which was taken up by the whole assembly</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Butler | 1991 | p = 407}}Ambrose was known to be Catholic in belief, but also acceptable to Arians due to the charity shown in theological matters in this regard</span>
				<span class='text'>At first he energetically refused the office, for which he was in no way prepared: Ambrose was neither baptized nor formally trained in [[theology]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Attwater | John | 1993}} Upon his appointment, Ambrose fled to a colleague's home seeking to hide</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon receiving a letter from the Emperor [[Gratianus|Gratian]] praising the appropriateness of Rome appointing individuals evidently worthy of holy positions, Ambrose's host gave him up</span>
				<span class='text'>Within a week, he was baptized, ordained and duly consecrated bishop of [[Milan]]</span>

				<span class='text'>This raised his popularity even further, giving him considerable political leverage over even the emperor</span>
				<span class='text'>Ambrose also wrote a treatise by the name of &quot;The Goodness of Death&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>== Arianism ===According to legend, Ambrose immediately and forcefully stopped [[Arianism]] in Milan</span>
				<span class='text'>He studied theology with [[Simplician]], a [[presbyter]] of Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>Using his excellent knowledge of Greek, which was then rare in the West, to his advantage, he studied the Old Testament and Greek authors like [[Philo]], [[Origen]], [[Athanasius]], and [[Basil of Caesarea]], with whom he was also exchanging letters</span>

				<span class='text'>n the confrontation with Arians, Ambrose sought to theologically refute their propositions, which were contrary to the [[Nicene creed]] and thus to the officially defined orthodoxy</span>
				<span class='text'>The Arians appealed to many high level leaders and clergy in both the Western and Eastern empires</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the western Emperor [[Gratian]] supported orthodoxy, the younger [[Valentinian II]], who became his colleague in the Empire, adhered to the Arian creed</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Butler | 1991 | p = 408}} Ambrose did not sway the young prince's position</span>
				<span class='text'>In the East, Emperor [[Theodosius I]] likewise professed the Nicene creed; but there were many adherents of Arianism throughout his dominions, especially among the higher clergy</span>
				<span class='text'>n this contested state of religious opinion, two leaders of the Arians, bishops [[Palladius of Ratiaria]] and Secundianus of [[Singidunum]], confident of numbers, prevailed upon Gratian to call a general council from all parts of the empire</span>
				<span class='text'>This request appeared so equitable that he complied without hesitation</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Ambrose feared the consequences and prevailed upon the emperor to have the matter determined by a council of the Western bishops</span>
				<span class='text'>Accordingly, a [[Council of Aquileia, 381|synod]] composed of thirty-two bishops was held at [[Aquileia]] in the year 381</span>
				<span class='text'>Ambrose was elected president and Palladius, being called upon to defend his opinions, declined</span>
				<span class='text'>A vote was then taken, when Palladius and his associate Secundianus were deposed from their episcopal offices</span>
				<span class='text'>evertheless, the increasing strength of the Arians proved a formidable task for Ambrose</span>
				<span class='text'>In 385{{Sfn | Butler | 1991 | p = 408}} or 386 the emperor and his mother [[Justina (empress)|Justina]], along with a considerable number of [[clergy]] and [[laity]], especially military, professed Arianism</span>
				<span class='text'>They demanded two churches in [[Milan]], one in the city (the [[Basilica]] of the Apostles), the other in the suburbs (St Victor's), to the Arians</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Butler | 1991 | p = 408}} Ambrose refused and was required to answer for his conduct before the council</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Attwater | John | 1993}}{{Rp| needed = yes|date=August 2012}} He went, his eloquence in defense of the Church reportedly overawing the ministers of Valentinian, so he was permitted to retire without making the surrender of the churches</span>
				<span class='text'>The day following, when he was performing [[Liturgy of the Hours|divine service]] in the basilica, the prefect of the city came to persuade him to give up at least the Portian basilica in the suburbs</span>
				<span class='text'>As he still refused, certain deans or officers of the court were sent to take possession of the Portian basilica, by hanging up in it imperial escutcheons{{sfn|Butler|1991|p=408}} to prepare for the arrival of the emperor and his mother at the ensuing festival of [[Easter]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n spite of Imperial opposition, Bishop Ambrose declared:{{quote |If you demand my person, I am ready to submit: carry me to prison or to death, I will not resist; but I will never betray the church of Christ</span>
				<span class='text'>I will not call upon the people to succour me; I will die at the foot of the altar rather than desert it</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|''[[Saint Ambrose barring Theodosius from Milan Cathedral]]'' by [[Anthony van Dyck]]]]The imperial court was displeased with the religious principles of Ambrose, however his aid was soon solicited by the Emperor</span>
				<span class='text'>When [[Magnus Maximus]] usurped the supreme power in [[Gaul]], and was meditating a descent upon Italy, Valentinian sent Ambrose to dissuade him from the undertaking, and the embassy was successful</span>
				<span class='text'> second later embassy was unsuccessful</span>
				<span class='text'>The enemy entered [[Italy]] and [[Milan]] was taken</span>
				<span class='text'>Justina and her son fled but Ambrose remained at his post and did good service to many of the sufferers by causing the plate of the church to be melted for their relief</span>
				<span class='text'>n 385 Ambrose, backed by Milan's populace, refused [[Valentinian II]]'s imperial request to hand over the Portian basilica for the use of Arian troops</span>
				<span class='text'>In 386 Justina and Valentinian received the Arian bishop [[Auxentius of Durostorum|Auxentius the younger]], and Ambrose was again ordered to hand over a church in Milan for Arian usage</span>
				<span class='text'>Ambrose and his congregation barricaded themselves inside the church, and the imperial order was rescinded</span>

				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Attwater | John | 1993}}{{Rp| needed = yes|date=August 2012}} Ambrose told Theodosius to imitate [[David (biblical king)|David]] in his repentance as he had imitated him in guilt&amp;nbsp;— Ambrose readmitted the emperor to the Eucharist only after several months of penance</span>

				<span class='text'>n 392, after the death of [[Valentinian II]] and the acclamation of [[Eugenius]], Ambrose supplicated the emperor for the pardon of those who had supported Eugenius after Theodosius was eventually victorious</span>

				<span class='text'>mbrose displayed a kind of liturgical flexibility that kept in mind that liturgy was a tool to serve people in worshiping God, and ought not to become a rigid entity that is invariable from place to place</span>

				<span class='text'>&quot;When I am at Rome, I fast on a Saturday; when I am at Milan, I do not</span>

				<span class='text'>]{{Main|Ambrosian Hymnography}}Ambrose is traditionally credited but not actually known to have composed any of the repertory of [[Ambrosian chant]] also known simply as &quot;antiphonal [[chant]]&quot;, a method of chanting where one side of the choir alternately responds to the other</span>
				<span class='text'>(The later pope St</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Gregory I the Great]] is not known to have composed any [[Gregorian chant]], the [[plainsong]] or &quot;[[Romish chant]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'> However, Ambrosian chant was named in his honor due to his contributions to the music of the Church; he is credited with introducing [[hymnody]] from the Eastern Church into the West</span>
				<span class='text'>atching the impulse from [[Hilary of Arles|Hilary]] and confirmed in it by the success of Arian [[psalmody]], Ambrose composed several original [[hymn]]s as well, four of which still survive, along with music which may not have changed too much from the original melodies</span>
				<span class='text'>Each of these hymns has eight four-line [[stanza]]s and is written in strict iambic dimeter (that is 2 x 2 iambs)</span>
				<span class='text'>arked by dignified simplicity, they served as a fruitful model for later times</span>
				<span class='text'> ''Deus Creator Omnium''* ''Aeterne rerum conditor''* ''Jam surgit hora tertia''* ''Jam Christus astra ascenderat''* ''[[Veni redemptor gentium]]'' (a [[Christmas]] hymn)In his writings, Ambrose refers only to the performance of [[psalms]], in which solo singing of psalm verses alternated with a congregational refrain called an ''[[antiphon]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>t</span>
				<span class='text'>Ambrose was also traditionally credited with composing the hymn ''[[Te Deum]]'', which he is said to have composed when he baptised [[Augustine of Hippo|St</span>
				<span class='text'>Augustine of Hippo]], his celebrated convert</span>
				<span class='text'>= Augustine ==Ambrose was Bishop of Milan at the time of Augustine's conversion, and is mentioned in [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine's]] ''[[Confessions (St</span>
				<span class='text'>Augustine)|Confessions]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>It is commonly understood in the Christian Tradition that Ambrose baptized Augustine</span>
				<span class='text'>== Celibacy ===In a passage of [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine's]] ''[[Confessions (St</span>
				<span class='text'>Augustine)|Confessions]]'' in which Augustine wonders why he could not share his burden with Ambrose, he makes a comment which bears on the history of celibacy:{{quote|Ambrose himself I esteemed a happy man, as the world counted happiness, because great personages held him in honor</span>
				<span class='text'>Only his celibacy appeared to me a painful burden</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;AugustineOnAmbrose&quot;&gt;Augustine</span>
				<span class='text'>''Confessions'' Book Six, Chapter Three</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;}}=== Reading ===In this same passage of [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine's]] ''[[Confessions (St</span>
				<span class='text'>Augustine)|Confessions]]'' is a curious anecdote which bears on the history of reading:{{quote |When [Ambrose] read, his eyes scanned the page and his heart sought out the meaning, but his voice was silent and his tongue was still</span>
				<span class='text'>Anyone could approach him freely and guests were not commonly announced, so that often, when we came to visit him, we found him reading like this in silence, for he never read aloud</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;AugustineOnAmbrose&quot; /&gt;}}This is a celebrated passage in modern scholarly discussion</span>
				<span class='text'>The practice of reading to oneself without vocalizing the text was less common in antiquity than it has since become</span>
				<span class='text'>In a culture that set a high value on oratory and public performances of all kinds, in which the production of books was very labor-intensive, the majority of the population was illiterate, and where those with the leisure to enjoy literary works also had slaves to read for them, written texts were more likely to be seen as scripts for recitation than as vehicles of silent reflection</span>
				<span class='text'>However, there is also evidence that silent reading did occur in antiquity and that it was not generally regarded as unusual</span>
