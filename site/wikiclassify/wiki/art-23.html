				<span class='text'>He was  of  and  headquartered in Milan before being made bishop of Milan by popular acclamation in 374</span>
				<span class='text'>Ambrose was a staunch opponent of  and has been accused of fostering persecutions of Arians s and s</span>
				<span class='text'>raditionally Ambrose is credited with promoting antiphonal chant a style of chanting in which one side of the choir responds alternately to the other as well as with composing  a  hymn</span>
				<span class='text'>mbrose was one of the four original  and is the  of Milan</span>
				<span class='text'>He is notable for his influence on </span>

				<span class='text'>name CE  His father was Aurelius Ambrosius  the  his mother was a woman of intellect and piety</span>
				<span class='text'>Ambroses siblings  who is the subject of Ambroses De excessu fratris Satyri and  are also venerated as saints</span>
				<span class='text'> There is a legend that as an infant a swarm of s settled on his face while he lay in his cradle leaving behind a drop of </span>
				<span class='text'>His father considered this a  of his future eloquence and honeyed tongue</span>
				<span class='text'>For this reason bees and  often appear in the </span>
				<span class='text'>fter the early death of his father Ambrose followed his fathers career</span>
				<span class='text'>He was educated in Rome studying   and </span>
				<span class='text'>  first gave him a place in the council and then in about 372 made him  or Governor of  and  with headquarters at  which was then beside Rome the second capital in Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>mbrose was the Governor of Aemilia Liguria in northern Italy until 374 when he became the Bishop of Milan</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a very popular political figure and since he was the Governor in the effective capital in the Roman West he was a recognizable figure in the court of the  </span>
				<span class='text'>Ambrose never married</span>
				<span class='text'>n the late 4th century there was a deep conflict in the  between the Catholics and </span>
				<span class='text'> In 374  an Arian died and the Arians challenged the </span>
				<span class='text'>Ambrose went to the church where the election was to take place to prevent an uproar which was probable in this crisis</span>
				<span class='text'>His address was interrupted by a call Ambrose bishop which was taken up by the whole assembly</span>
				<span class='text'>mbrose was known to be Catholic in belief but also acceptable to Arians due to the charity shown in theological matters in this regard</span>
				<span class='text'>At first he energetically used the office for which he was in no way prepared Ambrose was neither baptized nor formally trained in </span>
				<span class='text'>Upon his appointment Ambrose fled to a colleagues home seeking to hide</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon receiving a letter from the Emperor  praising the appropriateness of Rome appointing individuals evidently worthy of holy positions Ambroses host gave him up</span>
				<span class='text'>Within a week he was baptized ordained and duly consecrated bishop of </span>
				<span class='text'>s bishop he immediately adopted an ascetic lifestyle apportioned his money to the poor donating all of his land making only provision for his sister  who later became a nun name   CE   and committed the care of his family to his brother</span>
				<span class='text'>This raised his popularity even further giving him considerable political leverage over even the emperor</span>
				<span class='text'>Ambrose also wrote a treatise by the name of The Goodness of Death</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to legend Ambrose immediately and forcefully stopped  in Milan</span>
				<span class='text'>He studied theology with  a  of Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>Using his excellent knowledge of Greek which was then rare in the West to his advantage he studied the Old Testament and Greek authors like    and  with whom he was also exchanging letters</span>
				<span class='text'> He applied this knowledge as preacher concentrating especially on exegesis of the Old Testament and his rhetorical abilities impressed  who hitherto had thought poorly of Christian preachers</span>
				<span class='text'>n the confrontation with Arians Ambrose sought to theologically ute their propositions which were contrary to the  and thus to the officially defined orthodoxy</span>
				<span class='text'>The Arians appealed to many high level leaders and clergy in both the Western and Eastern empires</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the western Emperor  supported orthodoxy the younger  who became his colleague in the Empire adhered to the Arian creed</span>
				<span class='text'>Ambrose did not sway the young princes position</span>
				<span class='text'>In the East Emperor  likewise professed the Nicene creed but there were many adherents of Arianism throughout his dominions especially among the higher clergy</span>
				<span class='text'>n this contested state of religious opinion two leaders of the Arians bishops  and Secundianus of  confident of numbers prevailed upon Gratian to call a general council from all parts of the empire</span>
				<span class='text'>This request appeared so equitable that he complied without hesitation</span>
				<span class='text'>However Ambrose feared the consequences and prevailed upon the emperor to have the matter determined by a council of the Western bishops</span>
				<span class='text'>Accordingly a  composed of thirty two bishops was held at  in the year 381</span>
				<span class='text'>Ambrose was elected president and Palladius being called upon to defend his opinions declined</span>
				<span class='text'>A vote was then taken when Palladius and his associate Secundianus were deposed from their episcopal offices</span>
				<span class='text'>evertheless the increasing strength of the Arians proved a formidable task for Ambrose</span>
				<span class='text'>In 385 or 386 the emperor and his mother  along with a considerable number of  and  especially military professed Arianism</span>
				<span class='text'>They demanded two churches in  one in the city the  of the Apostles the other in the suburbs St Victors to the Arians</span>
				<span class='text'>Ambrose used and was required to answer for his conduct before the council</span>
				<span class='text'>He went his eloquence in defense of the Church reportedly overawing the ministers of Valentinian so he was permitted to retire without making the surrender of the churches</span>
				<span class='text'>The day following when he was performing  in the basilica the pect of the city came to persuade him to give up at least the Portian basilica in the suburbs</span>
				<span class='text'>As he still used certain deans or officers of the court were sent to take possession of the Portian basilica by hanging up in it imperial escutcheons to prepare for the arrival of the emperor and his mother at the ensuing festival of </span>
				<span class='text'>n spite of Imperial opposition Bishop Ambrose declaredThe imperial court was displeased with the religious principles of Ambrose however his aid was soon solicited by the Emperor</span>
				<span class='text'>When  usurped the supreme power in  and was meditating a descent upon Italy Valentinian sent Ambrose to dissuade him from the undertaking and the embassy was successful</span>
				<span class='text'> second later embassy was unsuccessful</span>
				<span class='text'>The enemy entered  and  was taken</span>
				<span class='text'>Justina and her son fled but Ambrose remained at his post and did good service to many of the sufferers by causing the plate of the church to be melted for their relief</span>
				<span class='text'>n 385 Ambrose backed by Milans populace used s imperial request to hand over the Portian basilica for the use of Arian troops</span>
				<span class='text'>In 386 Justina and Valentinian received the Arian bishop  and Ambrose was again ordered to hand over a church in Milan for Arian usage</span>
				<span class='text'>Ambrose and his congregation barricaded themselves inside the church and the imperial order was rescinded</span>
				<span class='text'> the emperor of the East espoused the cause of Justina and regained the kingdom</span>
				<span class='text'>Theodosius was  by Ambrose for the  of 7000 people at  in 390 after the murder of the Roman governor there by rioters</span>
				<span class='text'>Ambrose told Theodosius to imitate  in his repentance as he had imitated him in guiltampnbsp— Ambrose readmitted the emperor to the Eucharist only after several months of penance</span>
				<span class='text'>Ambrose also forced Theodosius to retreat from compensating a Jewish community in Mesopotamia when a synagogue was burnt down by militant Christians</span>
				<span class='text'> These incidents show the strong position of a bishop in the Western part of the empire even when facing a strong emperorampnbsp— the controversy of  with a much weaker emperor a few years later in Constantinople led to a crushing defeat of the bishop</span>
				<span class='text'>n 392 after the death of  and the acclamation of  Ambrose supplicated the emperor for the pardon of those who had supported Eugenius after Theodosius was eventually victorious</span>

				<span class='text'>any circumstances in the history of Ambrose are characteristic of the general spirit of the times</span>
				<span class='text'>The chief causes of his victory over his opponents were his great popularity and the reverence paid to the episcopal character at that period</span>
				<span class='text'>But it must also be noted that he used several indirect means to obtain and support his authority with the people</span>
				<span class='text'>e was generous to the  it was his custom to comment severely in his preaching on the public characters of his times and he introduced popular orms in the order and manner of public worship</span>
				<span class='text'>It is alleged too that at a time when the influence of Ambrose required vigorous support he was admonished in a dream to search for and found under the pavement of the church the remains of two s </span>
				<span class='text'>The saints although they would have had to have been hundreds of years old looked as if they had just died</span>

				<span class='text'>Theologians compare him with  who they claim fell short of Ambroses administrative excellence but demonstrated greater  ability</span>
				<span class='text'>He succeeded as a theologian despite his juridical training and his comparatively late handling of  and  subjects</span>
				<span class='text'>mbroses intense episcopal consciousness furthered the growing  of the Church and its  ministry while the prevalent  of the day continuing the  and nian training of his youth enabled him to promulgate a lofty standard of Christian </span>
				<span class='text'>Thus we have the De officiis ministrorum De viduis De virginitate and De paenitentia</span>
				<span class='text'>mbrose displayed a kind of liturgical flexibility that kept in mind that liturgy was a tool to serve people in worshiping God and ought not to become a rigid entity that is invariable from place to place</span>
				<span class='text'>His advice to Augustine of Hippo on this point was to follow local liturgical custom</span>
				<span class='text'>When I am at Rome I fast on a Saturday when I am at Milan I do not</span>
				<span class='text'>Follow the custom of the church where you are</span>

				<span class='text'>For exampleAmbrose considered the poor not a distinct group of outsiders but a part of the united solidary people</span>
