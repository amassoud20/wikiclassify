				<span class='text'>fter  in 1956 Solzhenitsyn was freed from exile and </span>
				<span class='text'>Following his return from exile Solzhenitsyn was while teaching at a secondary school during the day spending his nights secretly engaged in writing</span>
				<span class='text'>In his Nobel Prize acceptance speech he wrote that during all the years until 1961 not only was I convinced I should never see a single line of mine in print in my lifetime but also I scarcely dared allow any of my close acquaintances to read anything I had written because I feared this would become known</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1960 aged 42 he approached  a poet and the chief editor of the Novyi Mir magazine with the manuscript of </span>
				<span class='text'>It was published in edited form in 1962 with the explicit approval of  who defended it at the presidium of the Politburo hearing on whether to allow its publication and added Theres a Stalinist in each of you theres even a Stalinist in me</span>
				<span class='text'>We must root out this evil</span>
				<span class='text'> The book quickly sold out and became an instant hit</span>
				<span class='text'>In the 1960s while he was publicly known to be writing Cancer Ward he was simultaneously writing The Gulag Archipelago</span>
				<span class='text'>During Khrushchevs tenure One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich was studied in schools in the Soviet Union as were three more short works of Solzhenitsyns including his acclaimed short story Matryonas Home published in 1963</span>
				<span class='text'>These would be the last of his works published in the Soviet Union until 1990</span>
				<span class='text'>ne Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich brought the Soviet system of prison labour to the attention of the West</span>
				<span class='text'> It caused as much of a sensation in the Soviet Union as it did in the West—not only by its striking realism and candor but also because it was the first major piece of Soviet literature since the 1920s on a politically charged theme written by a non party member indeed a man who had been to Siberia for libelous speech about the leaders and yet its publication had been officially permitted</span>
				<span class='text'>In this sense the publication of Solzhenitsyns story was an almost unheard of instance of free unrestrained discussion of politics through literature</span>
				<span class='text'>Most Soviet readers realized this but after Khrushchev had been ousted from power in 1964 the time for such raw exposing works came to an end</span>
				<span class='text'>olzhenitsyn made an unsuccessful attempt with the help of Tvardovsky to get his novel Cancer Ward legally published in the Soviet Union</span>
				<span class='text'>This had to get the approval of the </span>
				<span class='text'>Though some there appreciated it the work ultimately was denied publication unless it was to be revised and cleaned of suspect statements and anti Soviet insinuations</span>
				<span class='text'>After Krushchevs removal in 1964 the cultural climate again became more repressive</span>
				<span class='text'>Publishing of Solzhenitsyns work quickly stopped as a writer he became a  and by 1965 the  had seized some of his papers including the manuscript of The First Circle</span>
				<span class='text'>Meanwhile Solzhenitsyn continued to secretly and feverishly work upon the most subversive of all his writings The Gulag Archipelago</span>
				<span class='text'> The seizing of his novel manuscript first made him desperate and frightened but gradually he realized that it had set him free from the pretenses and trappings of being an officially acclaimed writer something which had come close to second nature but which was becoming increasingly irrelevant</span>
				<span class='text'>fter the KGB had confiscated Solzhenitsyns materials in Moscow during 1965–67 the preparatory drafts of  were turned into finished typescript in hiding at his friends homes in </span>
				<span class='text'>Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn had befriended  a lawyer and former Estonian Minister of Education in a  Prison cell</span>
				<span class='text'>After completion Solzhenitsyns original handwritten script was kept hidden from the KGB in Estonia by Arnold Susis daughter Heli Susi until the collapse of the Soviet Union</span>
				<span class='text'> In 1969 Solzhenitsyn was expelled from the Union of Writers</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1970 he was awarded the </span>
				<span class='text'>He could not receive the prize personally in  at that time since he was afraid he would not be let back into the Soviet Union</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead it was suggested he should receive the prize in a special ceremony at the Swedish embassy in Moscow</span>
				<span class='text'> The Swedish government used to accept this solution however since such a ceremony and the ensuing media coverage might upset the Soviet Union and damage Swedish Soviet relations</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead Solzhenitsyn received his prize at the 1974 ceremony after he had been expelled from the Soviet Union</span>
				<span class='text'>he Gulag Archipelago was composed during 1958–67</span>
				<span class='text'> This work was a three volume seven part work on the Soviet prison camp system Solzhenitsyn never had all seven parts of the work in front of him at any one time</span>
				<span class='text'>The Gulag Archipelago has sold over thirty million copies in thirty five languages</span>
				<span class='text'>It was based upon Solzhenitsyns own experience as well as the testimony of 256  former prisoners and Solzhenitsyns own research into the history of the penal system</span>
				<span class='text'> It discussed the systems origins from the founding of the Communist regime with  having responsibility detailing interrogation procedures prisoner transports prison camp culture  and the practice of </span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to fellow gulag historian  The Gulag Archipelagos rich and varied authorial voice its unique weaving together of personal testimony philosophical analysis and historical investigation and its unrelenting indictment of communist ideology made The Gulag Archipelago one of the most impactful books of the 20th century</span>
				<span class='text'>The Gulag Archipelago was met with extensive criticism by Party controlled Soviet press even though the book was not published in the USSR</span>
				<span class='text'>An editorial in  on 14 January 1974 accused Solzhenitsyn of supporting Hitlerites and making excuses for the crimes of the  and  gangs</span>
				<span class='text'>According to the editorial Solzhenitsyn was choking with pathological hatred for the country where he was born and grew up for the socialist system and for Soviet people</span>
				<span class='text'>During this period he was sheltered by the cellist  who suffered considerably for his support of Solzhenitsyn and was eventually forced into exile himself</span>
				<span class='text'>n August 1971 the KGB allegedly made an attempt to assassinate Solzhenitsyn using an unknown biological agent most likely  with an experimental gel based delivery method</span>
				<span class='text'>The attempt left him seriously ill but ultimately was not successful</span>
				<span class='text'> On 12 February 1974 Solzhenitsyn was arrested and deported the next day from the Soviet Union to  West Germany and stripped of his Soviet citizenship</span>

				<span class='text'>espite spending almost two decades in the United States Solzhenitsyn did not become fluent in spoken English</span>
				<span class='text'>He had however been reading English language literature since his teens encouraged by his mother</span>
				<span class='text'>More importantly he resented the idea of becoming a media star and of tempering his ideas or ways of talking in order to suit television</span>

				<span class='text'>In a major speech delivered to the International Academy of Philosophy in Liechtenstein on 14 September 1993 Solzhenitsyn implored the West not to lose sight of its own values its historically unique stability of civic life under the rule of law—a hard won stability which grants independence and space to every private citizen</span>

				<span class='text'> In Solzhenitsyns case its not racial</span>
				<span class='text'>It has nothing to do with blood</span>

				<span class='text'>According to professor of Jewish history  textological analyses of the essay indicate Solzhenitsyns authorship</span>
				<span class='text'>Solzhenitsyn responded by saying that the essay was written using manuscripts stolen from him by the KGB forty years before</span>

				<span class='text'>name young  Although Two Hundred Years Together has never been published in the  long excerpts from it appear in The Solzhenitsyn Reader</span>
				<span class='text'>The book began with a plea for patient mutual comprehension on the part of Russian Gentiles and Jews</span>

				<span class='text'>t the end of chapter 15 Solzhenitsyn expressed a belief that every people must answer morally for all of its past    including that past which is shameful</span>
				<span class='text'>In this spirit he urged the Jewish people to answer both for the revolutionary cutthroats and the ranks willing to serve them</span>

				<span class='text'>The elder political generation in communist countries is not ready for repentance while the new generation is only too happy to voice grievances and level accusations with present day Moscow as a convenient target</span>
				<span class='text'>They behave as if they heroically liberated themselves and lead a new life now while Moscow has remained communist</span>
