				<span class='text'>His experiences there became the basis of his novel ''[[Cancer Ward]]'' and also found an echo in the short story &quot;The Right Hand</span>

				<span class='text'>These would be the last of his works published in the Soviet Union until 1990</span>
				<span class='text'>'One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich'' brought the Soviet system of prison labour to the attention of the West</span>
				<span class='text'> It caused as much of a sensation in the Soviet Union as it did in the West—not only by its striking realism and candor, but also because it was the first major piece of Soviet literature since the 1920s on a politically charged theme, written by a non-party member, indeed a man who had been to Siberia for &quot;libelous speech&quot; about the leaders, and yet its publication had been officially permitted</span>

				<span class='text'>Meanwhile, Solzhenitsyn continued to secretly and feverishly work upon the most subversive of all his writings, ''The Gulag Archipelago''</span>
				<span class='text'> The seizing of his novel manuscript first made him desperate and frightened, but gradually he realized that it had set him free from the pretenses and trappings of being an &quot;officially acclaimed&quot; writer, something which had come close to second nature, but which was becoming increasingly irrelevant</span>

				<span class='text'> It discussed the system's origins from the founding of the Communist regime, with [[Vladimir Lenin]] having responsibility, detailing interrogation procedures, prisoner transports, prison camp culture, [[Kengir uprising|prisoner uprisings and revolts]], and the practice of [[internal exile]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to fellow gulag historian [[Anne Applebaum]], ''The Gulag Archipelago'''s rich and varied authorial voice, its unique weaving together of personal testimony, philosophical analysis, and historical investigation, and its unrelenting indictment of communist ideology, made ''The Gulag Archipelago'' one of the most impactful books of the 20th century</span>

				<span class='text'>The book began with a plea for &quot;patient mutual comprehension&quot; on the part of Russian Gentiles and Jews</span>
				<span class='text'>Solzhenitsyn explained that the book was conceived in the hope of promoting &quot;mutually agreeable and fruitful pathways for the future development of Russian-Jewish relations&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[#Ericson2009|Ericson (2009)]] p</span>
				<span class='text'>489&lt;/ref&gt;In Chapter 9, Solzhenitsyn said that, &quot;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>t would be quite wrong to say that the Jews 'organized' the revolutions of 1905 and 1917, just as it was not organized by any other nation as such</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;At the end of chapter 15, Solzhenitsyn expressed a belief that, &quot;every people must answer morally for all of its past -- including that past which is shameful</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; In this spirit, he urged the Jewish people to answer, &quot;both for the revolutionary cutthroats and the ranks willing to serve them</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; It is not, he insists, a matter of answering &quot;before other peoples, but to oneself, to one's consciousness, and before God</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He explains that Russian Gentiles must also repent &quot;for the [[pogrom]]s, for those merciless arsonist peasants, for those crazed revolutionary soldiers, for those savage sailors</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>To answer just as we would answer for members of our own family</span>
				<span class='text'>For if we release ourselves from any responsibility for the actions of our national kin, the very concept of ''a people'' loses any real meaning</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===On Post-Soviet Russia===In some of his later political writings, such as ''Rebuilding Russia'' (1990) and ''Russia in Collapse'' (1998), Solzhenitsyn criticized the oligarchic excesses of the new Russian 'democracy,' while opposing any nostalgia for Soviet Communism</span>
				<span class='text'>He defended moderate and self-critical patriotism (as opposed to [[Radical nationalism in Russia|extreme nationalism]]), urged local self-government to a free Russia, and expressed concerns for the fate of the 25 million ethnic Russians in the &quot;[[near abroad]]&quot; of the former Soviet Union</span>
				<span class='text'>n a 2007 interview with ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', Solzhenitsyn expressed disappointment that the &quot;conflation of 'Soviet' and 'Russian', against which I spoke so often in the 1970's, has not passed away in the West, in the ex-socialist countries, or in the former Soviet republics</span>
				<span class='text'>The elder political generation in communist countries is not ready for repentance, while the new generation is only too happy to voice grievances and level accusations, with present-day Moscow [as] a convenient target</span>
				<span class='text'>They behave as if they heroically liberated themselves and lead a new life now, while Moscow has remained communist</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, I dare [to] hope that this unhealthy phase will soon be over, that all the peoples who have lived through communism will understand that communism is to blame for the bitter pages of their history</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;According to Solzhenitsyn, Russians were not the ruling nation in the Soviet Union</span>
				<span class='text'>He believed that all the traditional culture of all ethnic groups were equally oppressed in favor of an atheism and Marxist-Leninism</span>
				<span class='text'>Russian culture was even more repressed than any other culture in the Soviet Union, since the regime was more afraid of ethnic uprisings among Russian Christians than among any other ethnicity</span>

				<span class='text'>Moreover, he attacks [[Pan-Slavism]], the idea that Russia had a mission to unite Slavic peoples and to come to the defense of the Orthodox wherever they were under threat, as a 'wretched idea'</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===World War II===Solzhenitsyn criticized the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] for not opening a new front against [[Nazi Germany]] in the west earlier in World War II</span>
				<span class='text'>This resulted in Soviet domination and oppression of the nations of Eastern Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>Solzhenitsyn claimed the Western democracies apparently cared little about how many died in the East, as long as they could end the war quickly and painlessly for themselves in the West</span>
				<span class='text'>==The Sino-Soviet Conflict===In 1973, near the height of the [[Sino-Soviet split|Sino-Soviet conflict]], Solzhenitsyn sent a ''Letter to the Soviet Leaders'' to a limited number of upper echelon Soviet officials</span>

				<span class='text'>According to him, the lie of the [[Holodomor genocide question|Holodomor being genocide]] was invented decades later after the event, and Ukrainian effort to have the famine recognized as genocide is an act of [[historical revisionism]] that has now surpassed the level of [[Bolshevik]] [[agitprop]]</span>
