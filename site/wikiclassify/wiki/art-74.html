				<span class='text'>The newly arrived family soon hired Louise Delfault, a maid who eventually became an instrumental member of the family</span>
				<span class='text'> Étienne, who never remarried, decided that he alone would educate his children, for they all showed extraordinary intellectual ability, particularly his son Blaise</span>
				<span class='text'> The young Pascal showed an amazing aptitude for mathematics and science</span>
				<span class='text'>articularly of interest to Pascal was a work of [[Gérard Desargues|Desargues]] on [[conic section]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>Following Desargues' thinking, the 16-year-old Pascal produced, as a means of proof, a short treatise on what was called the &quot;Mystic Hexagram&quot;, ''Essai pour les coniques'' (&quot;Essay on Conics&quot;) and sent it—his first serious work of mathematics—to [[Marin Mersenne|Père Mersenne]] in Paris; it is known still today as [[Pascal's theorem]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It states that if a hexagon is inscribed in a circle (or conic) then the three intersection points of opposite sides lie on a line (called the Pascal line)</span>
				<span class='text'>ascal's work was so precocious that Descartes was convinced that Pascal's father had written it</span>
				<span class='text'>When assured by Mersenne that it was, indeed, the product of the son and not the father, Descartes dismissed it with a sniff: &quot;I do not find it strange that he has offered demonstrations about conics more appropriate than those of the ancients,&quot; adding, &quot;but other matters related to this subject can be proposed that would scarcely occur to a 16-year-old child</span>

				<span class='text'>42&lt;/ref&gt; The money was invested in a [[government bond]] which provided, if not a lavish, then certainly a comfortable income which allowed the Pascal family to move to, and enjoy, Paris</span>
				<span class='text'>But in 1638 Richelieu, desperate for money to carry on the [[Thirty Years' War]], defaulted on the government's bonds</span>
				<span class='text'>Suddenly Étienne Pascal's worth had dropped from nearly 66,000 livres to less than 7,300</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|left|thumb|An early [[Pascal's calculator|Pascaline]] on display at the [[Musée des Arts et Métiers]], Paris]]Like so many others, Étienne was eventually forced to flee Paris because of his opposition to the fiscal policies of [[Cardinal Richelieu]], leaving his three children in the care of his neighbor Madame Sainctot, a great beauty with an infamous past who kept one of the most glittering and intellectual salons in all France</span>
				<span class='text'>It was only when Jacqueline performed well in a children's play with Richelieu in attendance that Étienne was pardoned</span>
				<span class='text'>In time, Étienne was back in good graces with the cardinal and in 1639 had been appointed the king's commissioner of taxes in the city of [[Rouen]]—a city whose tax records, thanks to uprisings, were in utter chaos</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1642, in an effort to ease his father's endless, exhausting calculations, and recalculations, of taxes owed and paid (into which work the young Pascal had been recruited), Pascal, not yet 19, constructed a mechanical calculator capable of addition and subtraction, called [[Pascal's calculator]] or the [[Pascaline]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Of the eight Pascalines known to have survived, four are held by the [[Musée des Arts et Métiers]] in Paris and one more by the [[Zwinger museum]] in [[Dresden]], Germany, exhibit two of his original mechanical calculators</span>

				<span class='text'>et&lt;/ref&gt; Though these machines are pioneering forerunners to a further 400 years of development of mechanical methods of calculation, and in a sense to the later field of [[computer engineering]], the calculator failed to be a great commercial success</span>
				<span class='text'>Partly because it was still quite cumbersome to use in practice, but probably primarily because it was extraordinarily expensive, the Pascaline became little more than a toy, and a [[status symbol]], for the very rich both in France and elsewhere in Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>Pascal continued to make improvements to his design through the next decade, and he refers to some 50 machines that were built to his design</span>

				<span class='text'>Pascal later (in the ''Pensées'') used a probabilistic argument, [[Pascal's Wager]], to justify belief in God and a virtuous life</span>

				<span class='text'>==Philosophy of mathematics===Pascal's major contribution to the [[philosophy of mathematics]] came with his ''De l'Esprit géométrique'' (&quot;Of the Geometrical Spirit&quot;), originally written as a preface to a geometry textbook for one of the famous &quot;''[[Petites écoles de Port-Royal|Petites-Ecoles de Port-Royal]]&quot; (&quot;Little Schools of Port-Royal&quot;)''</span>
				<span class='text'>The work was unpublished until over a century after his death</span>
				<span class='text'>Here, Pascal looked into the issue of discovering truths, arguing that the ideal of such a method would be to found all propositions on already established truths</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time, however, he claimed this was impossible because such established truths would require other truths to back them up—first principles, therefore, cannot be reached</span>
				<span class='text'>Based on this, Pascal argued that the procedure used in geometry was as perfect as possible, with certain principles assumed and other propositions developed from them</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, there was no way to know the assumed principles to be true</span>
				<span class='text'>ascal also used ''De l'Esprit géométrique'' to develop a theory of [[definition]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He distinguished between definitions which are conventional labels defined by the writer and definitions which are within the language and understood by everyone because they naturally designate their referent</span>
				<span class='text'>The second type would be characteristic of the philosophy of [[essentialism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Pascal claimed that only definitions of the first type were important to science and mathematics, arguing that those fields should adopt the philosophy of [[Formalism (philosophy)|formalism]] as formulated by Descartes</span>
				<span class='text'>n ''De l'Art de persuader'' (&quot;On the Art of Persuasion&quot;), Pascal looked deeper into geometry's [[axiomatic method]], specifically the question of how people come to be convinced of the [[axioms]] upon which later conclusions are based</span>
				<span class='text'>Pascal agreed with [[Montaigne]] that achieving certainty in these axioms and conclusions through human methods is impossible</span>
				<span class='text'>He asserted that these principles can be grasped only through intuition, and that this fact underscored the necessity for submission to God in searching out truths</span>
				<span class='text'>=Contributions to the physical sciences==[[File:Blaise Pascal 2</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|Portrait of Pascal]][[File:Pascal's Barrel</span>
				<span class='text'>ng|thumb|right|An illustration of the (apocryphal) [[Pascal's barrel]] experiment]]Pascal's work in the fields of the study of [[hydrodynamics]] and [[hydrostatics]] centered on the principles of [[hydraulic fluid]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>His inventions include the [[hydraulic press]] (using hydraulic pressure to multiply force) and the [[syringe]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He proved that hydrostatic pressure depends not on the weight of the fluid but on the elevation difference</span>
				<span class='text'>He demonstrated this principle by attaching a thin tube to a barrel full of water and filling the tube with water up to the level of the third floor of a building</span>
				<span class='text'>This caused the barrel to leak, in what became known as [[Pascal's barrel]] experiment</span>
				<span class='text'>y 1646, Pascal had learned of [[Evangelista Torricelli]]'s experimentation with [[barometer]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>Having replicated an experiment that involved placing a tube filled with mercury upside down in a bowl of mercury, Pascal questioned what force kept some mercury in the tube and what filled the space above the mercury in the tube</span>
				<span class='text'>At the time, most scientists contended that, rather than a [[vacuum]], some invisible matter was present</span>
				<span class='text'>This was based on the Aristotelian notion that creation was a thing of substance, whether visible or invisible; and that this substance was forever in motion</span>
				<span class='text'>Furthermore, &quot;Everything that is in motion must be moved by something,&quot; [[Aristotle]] declared</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Physics'', VII, 1</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, to the Aristotelian trained scientists of Pascal's time, a vacuum was an impossibility</span>
				<span class='text'>How so? As proof it was pointed out:* Light passed through the so-called &quot;vacuum&quot; in the glass tube</span>
				<span class='text'> Aristotle wrote how everything moved, and must be moved by something</span>
				<span class='text'> Therefore, since there had to be an invisible &quot;something&quot; to move the light through the glass tube, there was no vacuum in the tube</span>
				<span class='text'>Not in the glass tube or anywhere else</span>
				<span class='text'>Vacuums – the absence of any and everything – were simply an impossibility</span>
				<span class='text'>ollowing more experimentation in this vein, in 1647 Pascal produced ''Experiences nouvelles touchant le vide'' (&quot;New Experiments with the Vacuum&quot;), which detailed basic rules describing to what degree various liquids could be supported by air pressure</span>
				<span class='text'>It also provided reasons why it was indeed a vacuum above the column of liquid in a barometer tube</span>
				<span class='text'>n 19 September 1648, after many months of Pascal's friendly but insistent prodding, [[Florin Périer]], husband of Pascal's elder sister Gilberte, was finally able to carry out the fact-finding mission vital to Pascal's theory</span>
				<span class='text'>The account, written by Périer, reads:{{quote|The weather was chancy last Saturday</span>

				<span class='text'>This still fairly small sect was making surprising inroads into the French Catholic community at that time</span>

				<span class='text'> Blaise spoke with the doctors frequently, and upon his successful treatment of Étienne, borrowed from them works by Jansenist authors</span>
				<span class='text'> In this period, Pascal experienced a sort of &quot;first conversion&quot; and began to write on theological subjects in the course of the following year</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;His belief and religious commitment revitalized, Pascal visited the older of two convents at [[Port-Royal-des-Champs|Port-Royal]] for a two-week retreat in January 1655</span>
				<span class='text'>For the next four years, he regularly travelled between Port-Royal and Paris</span>
				<span class='text'> It was at this point immediately after his conversion when he began writing his first major literary work on religion, the ''Provincial Letters''</span>
				<span class='text'>==The ''Provincial Letters''==={{Main|Lettres provinciales}}{{French literature sidebar}}Beginning in 1656, Pascal published his memorable attack on [[casuistry]], a popular [[Ethics|ethical]] method used by [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] thinkers in the early modern period (especially the [[Jesuits]], and in particular [[Antonio Escobar y Mendoza|Antonio Escobar]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Pascal denounced casuistry as the mere use of complex reasoning to justify moral laxity and all sorts of [[sin]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>The 18-letter series was published between 1656 and 1657 under the pseudonym Louis de Montalte and incensed [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The king ordered that the book be shredded and burnt in 1660</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1661, in the midsts of the [[formulary controversy]], the Jansenist school at Port-Royal was condemned and closed down; those involved with the school had to sign a 1656 [[papal bull]] condemning the teachings of Jansen as heretical</span>
				<span class='text'> The final letter from Pascal, in 1657, had defied [[Alexander VII]] himself</span>
				<span class='text'> Even Pope Alexander, while publicly opposing them, nonetheless was persuaded by Pascal's arguments</span>
				<span class='text'>side from their religious influence, the ''Provincial Letters'' were popular as a literary work</span>
				<span class='text'>Pascal's use of humor, mockery, and vicious satire in his arguments made the letters ripe for public consumption, and influenced the prose of later French writers like [[Voltaire]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]</span>
				<span class='text'>harles Perrault wrote of the ''Letters'': &quot;Everything is there—purity of language, nobility of thought, solidity in reasoning, finesse in raillery, and throughout an ''agrément'' not to be found anywhere else</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===The ''Pensées''==={{wikisource|Pensées}}{{Main|Pensées}}Pascal's most influential theological work, referred to posthumously as the ''Pensées'' (&quot;Thoughts&quot;), was not completed before his death</span>
				<span class='text'> It was to have been a sustained and coherent examination and defense of the Christian faith, with the original title ''Apologie de la religion Chrétienne'' (&quot;Defense of the Christian Religion&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'> The first version of the numerous scraps of paper found after his death appeared in print as a book in 1669 titled ''Pensées de M</span>
				<span class='text'>Pascal sur la religion, et sur quelques autres sujets'' (&quot;Thoughts of M</span>
				<span class='text'>Pascal on religion, and on some other subjects&quot;) and soon thereafter became a classic</span>
				<span class='text'>One of the ''Apologie'''s main strategies was to use the contradictory philosophies of [[skepticism]] and [[stoicism]], personalized by [[Montaigne]] on one hand, and [[Epictetus]] on the other, in order to bring the unbeliever to such despair and confusion that he would embrace God</span>
				<span class='text'>ascal's ''Pensées'' is widely considered to be a masterpiece, and a landmark in French prose</span>
				<span class='text'> When commenting on one particular section (Thought #72), [[Sainte-Beuve]] praised it as the finest pages in the French language</span>

				<span class='text'>66 ISBN 1-56731-019-2&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Pensées'', Pascal surveys several philosophical paradoxes: infinity and nothing, faith and reason, soul and matter, death and life, meaning and vanity—seemingly arriving at no definitive conclusions besides humility, ignorance, and grace</span>

				<span class='text'>Aware that his health was fading quickly, he sought a move to the hospital for incurable diseases, but his doctors declared that he was too unstable to be carried</span>
				<span class='text'>In Paris on 18 August 1662, Pascal went into convulsions and received [[extreme unction]]</span>
