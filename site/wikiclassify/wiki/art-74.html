				<span class='text'>When assured by Mersenne that it was indeed the product of the son and not the father Descartes dismissed it with a sniff I do not find it strange that he has offered demonstrations about conics more appropriate than those of the ancients adding but other matters related to this subject can be proposed that would scarcely occur to a 16 year old child</span>

				<span class='text'>Pascal later in the Pensées used a probabilistic argument  to justify belief in God and a virtuous life</span>
				<span class='text'>The work done by Fermat and Pascal into the calculus of probabilities laid important groundwork for  formulation of the </span>
				<span class='text'>After a religious experience in 1654 Pascal mostly gave up work in mathematics</span>
				<span class='text'>ascals major contribution to the  came with his De lEsprit géométrique Of the Geometrical Spirit originally written as a pace to a geometry textbook for one of the famous  Little Schools of Port Royal</span>
				<span class='text'>The work was unpublished until over a century after his death</span>
				<span class='text'>Here Pascal looked into the issue of discovering truths arguing that the ideal of such a method would be to found all propositions on already established truths</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time however he claimed this was impossible because such established truths would require other truths to back them up—first principles theore cannot be reached</span>
				<span class='text'>Based on this Pascal argued that the procedure used in geometry was as perfect as possible with certain principles assumed and other propositions developed from them</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless there was no way to know the assumed principles to be true</span>
				<span class='text'>ascal also used De lEsprit géométrique to develop a theory of </span>
				<span class='text'>He distinguished between definitions which are conventional labels defined by the writer and definitions which are within the language and understood by everyone because they naturally designate their erent</span>
				<span class='text'>The second type would be characteristic of the philosophy of </span>
				<span class='text'>Pascal claimed that only definitions of the first type were important to science and mathematics arguing that those fields should adopt the philosophy of  as formulated by Descartes</span>
				<span class='text'>n De lArt de persuader On the Art of Persuasion Pascal looked deeper into geometrys  specifically the question of how people come to be convinced of the  upon which later conclusions are based</span>
				<span class='text'>Pascal agreed with  that achieving certainty in these axioms and conclusions through human methods is impossible</span>
				<span class='text'>He asserted that these principles can be grasped only through intuition and that this fact underscored the necessity for submission to God in searching out truths</span>
				<span class='text'>ontributions to the physical sciencesPascals work in the fields of the study of  and  centered on the principles of s</span>
				<span class='text'>His inventions include the  using hydraulic pressure to multiply force and the </span>
				<span class='text'>He proved that hydrostatic pressure depends not on the weight of the fluid but on the elevation difference</span>
				<span class='text'>He demonstrated this principle by attaching a thin tube to a barrel full of water and filling the tube with water up to the level of the third floor of a building</span>
				<span class='text'>This caused the barrel to leak in what became known as  experiment</span>
				<span class='text'>y 1646 Pascal had learned of s experimentation with s</span>
				<span class='text'>Having replicated an experiment that involved placing a tube filled with mercury upside down in a bowl of mercury Pascal questioned what force kept some mercury in the tube and what filled the space above the mercury in the tube</span>
				<span class='text'>At the time most scientists contended that rather than a  some invisible matter was present</span>
				<span class='text'>This was based on the Aristotelian notion that creation was a thing of substance whether visible or invisible and that this substance was forever in motion</span>
				<span class='text'>Furthermore Everything that is in motion must be moved by something  declared</span>
				<span class='text'>ristotle Physics VII 1</span>
				<span class='text'> Theore to the Aristotelian trained scientists of Pascals time a vacuum was an impossibility</span>
				<span class='text'>How so As proof it was pointed out Light passed through the so called vacuum in the glass tube</span>
				<span class='text'>Aristotle wrote how everything moved and must be moved by something</span>
				<span class='text'>Theore since there had to be an invisible something to move the light through the glass tube there was no vacuum in the tube</span>
				<span class='text'>Not in the glass tube or anywhere else</span>
				<span class='text'>Vacuums – the absence of any and everything – were simply an impossibility</span>
				<span class='text'>ollowing more experimentation in this vein in 1647 Pascal produced Experiences nouvelles touchant le vide New Experiments with the Vacuum which detailed basic rules describing to what degree various liquids could be supported by air pressure</span>
				<span class='text'>It also provided reasons why it was indeed a vacuum above the column of liquid in a barometer tube</span>

				<span class='text'>The mercury dropped two lines</span>
				<span class='text'>n the face of criticism that some invisible matter must exist in Pascals empty space Pascal in his reply to    WAIT  WAIT Before you remove the brackets consider writing a new article    gave one of the 17th centurys major statements on the scientific method which is a striking anticipation of the idea popularised by  that scientific theories are characterised by their  In order to show that a hypothesis is evident it does not suffice that all the phenomena follow from it instead if it leads to something contrary to a single one of the phenomena that suffices to establish its falsity</span>
