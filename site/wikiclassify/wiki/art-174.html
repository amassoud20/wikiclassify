				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; (December 21, 1940&amp;nbsp;– December 4, 1993) was an American musician, songwriter, composer, record producer, actor and filmmaker</span>
				<span class='text'>In a career spanning more than 30&amp;nbsp;years, Zappa composed rock, [[jazz]], orchestral and ''[[musique concrète]]'' works, and produced almost all of the more than 60&amp;nbsp;albums he released with the band [[the Mothers of Invention]] and as a solo artist</span>
				<span class='text'>He also directed feature-length films and music videos, and designed album covers</span>
				<span class='text'>appa was a self-taught composer and performer, and his diverse musical influences led him to create music that was often difficult to categorize</span>
				<span class='text'>While in his teens, he acquired a taste for 20th-century classical composers such as [[Edgard Varèse]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], and [[Anton Webern]], along with 1950s [[rhythm and blues]] music</span>
				<span class='text'>He began writing classical music in high school, while at the same time playing drums in rhythm and blues bands; later switching to electric guitar</span>
				<span class='text'>His 1966 debut album with the Mothers of Invention, ''[[Freak Out!]]'', combined songs in conventional rock and roll format with collective improvisations and studio-generated sound collages</span>
				<span class='text'>He continued this eclectic and experimental approach, irrespective of whether the fundamental format was rock, jazz or classical</span>
				<span class='text'>is lyrics—often humorously—reflected his [[iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] view of established social and political processes, structures and movements</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a strident critic of mainstream education and [[organized religion]], and a forthright and passionate advocate for [[freedom of speech]], [[autodidacticism|self-education]], political participation and the abolition of censorship</span>
				<span class='text'>e was a highly productive and prolific artist and gained widespread critical acclaim</span>
				<span class='text'>He had some commercial success, particularly in Europe, and worked as an independent artist for most of his career</span>
				<span class='text'>He also remains a major influence on musicians and composers</span>
				<span class='text'>Zappa was posthumously inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1995 and received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] in 1997</span>
				<span class='text'>In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked him at No</span>

				<span class='text'>His mother, Rose Marie (née Colimore), was of [[Italian American|Italian]] (more specifically, her family was from Naples and Sicily) and [[French American|French]] ancestry; his father, Francis Vincent Zappa, was an immigrant from [[Partinico]], Sicily, with [[Greek American|Greek]] and [[Arab American|Arab]] ancestry</span>

				<span class='text'>6&lt;/ref&gt; The family moved often because his father, a [[chemist]] and mathematician, worked in the defense industry</span>
				<span class='text'>After a time in Florida in the 1940s, the family returned to [[Maryland]], where Zappa's father worked at the [[Edgewood, Maryland|Edgewood]] Arsenal [[chemical warfare]] facility of the [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Due to their home's proximity to the arsenal, which stored [[sulfur mustard|mustard gas]], gas masks were kept in the home in case of an accident</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>8–9</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Zappa was often sick as a child, suffering from [[asthma]], [[Otalgia|earaches]] and [[Paranasal sinuses|sinus]] problems</span>
				<span class='text'>A doctor treated his sinusitis by inserting a pellet of [[radium]] into each of Zappa's nostrils</span>
				<span class='text'>At the time, little was known about the potential dangers of even small amounts of therapeutic radiation,&lt;ref name=&quot;Milesp10&quot;&gt;Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', p</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; About the same time his parents bought a phonograph, which allowed him to develop his interest in music, and to begin building his record collection</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He was interested in sounds for their own sake, particularly the sounds of drums and other percussion instruments</span>
				<span class='text'>By age 12, he had obtained a snare drum and began learning the basics of orchestral percussion</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;zappa29&quot;/&gt; Zappa's deep interest in modern classical music began&lt;ref name=&quot;idol&quot;/&gt; when he read a ''[[Look (American magazine)|LOOK]]'' magazine article about the [[Sam Goody]] record store chain that lauded its ability to sell an LP as obscure as ''The Complete Works of Edgard Varèse, Volume One''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Varese&quot;&gt;Zappa with Occhiogrosso, 1989, ''The Real Frank Zappa Book'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>30–33</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The article described [[Edgard Varèse|Varèse's]] percussion composition ''[[Ionisation (Varèse)|Ionisation]]'', produced by [[EMS Recordings]], as &quot;a weird jumble of drums and other unpleasant sounds&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Zappa decided to seek out Varèse's music</span>
				<span class='text'>After searching for over a year, Zappa found a copy (he noticed the LP because of the &quot;mad scientist&quot; looking photo of Varèse on the cover)</span>
				<span class='text'>Not having enough money with him, he persuaded the salesman to sell him the record at a discount</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Varese&quot;/&gt; Thus began his lifelong passion for Varèse's music and that of other modern classical composers</span>
				<span class='text'>appa grew up influenced by [[avant-garde]] composers such as Varèse, [[Igor Stravinsky]], and [[Anton Webern]], R&amp;B and [[doo-wop]] groups (particularly local [[pachuco]] groups), and modern jazz</span>
				<span class='text'>His own heterogeneous ethnic background, and the diverse social and cultural mix in and around greater Los Angeles, were crucial in the formation of Zappa as a practitioner of [[underground music]] and of his later distrustful and openly critical attitude towards &quot;mainstream&quot; social, political and musical movements</span>
				<span class='text'>He frequently lampooned musical fads like [[psychedelia]], [[rock opera]] and [[disco]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Among his many musical satires are the 1967 songs &quot;Flower Punk&quot; (which parodies the song &quot;[[Hey Joe]]&quot;) and &quot;Who Needs The Peace Corps?&quot;, which are critiques of the late-Sixties commercialization of the [[hippie]] phenomenon</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Television also exerted a strong influence, as demonstrated by quotations from show themes and advertising jingles found in his later works</span>

				<span class='text'>Zappa's mother encouraged him in his musical interests</span>
				<span class='text'>Although she disliked Varèse's music, she was indulgent enough to give her son a long distance call to the composer as a 15th birthday present</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Varese&quot;/&gt; Unfortunately, Varèse was in Europe at the time, so Zappa spoke to the composer's wife</span>
				<span class='text'>He later received a letter from Varèse thanking him for his interest, and telling him about a composition he was working on called &quot;[[Déserts]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Living in the desert town of Lancaster, Zappa found this very exciting</span>
				<span class='text'>Varèse invited him to visit if he ever came to New York</span>
				<span class='text'>The meeting never took place (Varèse died in 1965), but Zappa framed the letter and kept it on display for the rest of his life</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt;At [[Antelope Valley High School]], Zappa met Don Vliet (who later expanded his name to Don Van Vliet and adopted the stage name [[Captain Beefheart]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Zappa and Vliet became close friends, sharing an interest in R&amp;B records and influencing each other musically throughout their careers</span>

				<span class='text'>29–30</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, Zappa started playing drums in a local band, the Blackouts</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;watson13&quot;/&gt; The band was racially diverse, and included [[Jim Sherwood|Euclid James &quot;Motorhead&quot; Sherwood]] who later became a member of the Mothers of Invention</span>
				<span class='text'>Zappa's interest in the guitar grew, and in 1957 he was given his first instrument</span>

				<span class='text'>23</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Due to his family's frequent moves, Zappa attended at least six different high schools, and as a student he was often bored and given to distracting the rest of the class with juvenile antics</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|Frank Zappa in Paris, early 1970s]]Later in 1970, Zappa formed a new version of the Mothers (from then on, he mostly dropped the &quot;of Invention&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>It included British drummer [[Aynsley Dunbar]], jazz keyboardist [[George Duke]], [[Ian Underwood]], [[Jeff Simmons (musician)|Jeff Simmons]] (bass, rhythm guitar), and three members of [[the Turtles]]: bass player [[Jim Pons]], and singers [[Mark Volman]] and [[Howard Kaylan]], who, due to persistent legal and contractual problems, adopted the stage name &quot;The Phlorescent Leech and Eddie&quot;, or &quot;[[Flo &amp; Eddie]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>201</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;This version of the Mothers debuted on Zappa's next solo album ''[[Chunga's Revenge]]'' (1970),&lt;ref&gt;Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>205</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; which was followed by the double-album soundtrack to the movie ''200 Motels'' (1971), featuring the Mothers, the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]], [[Ringo Starr]], [[Theodore Bikel]], and [[Keith Moon]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Co-directed by Zappa and [[Tony Palmer (director)|Tony Palmer]], it was filmed in a week at [[Pinewood Studios]] outside London</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The score relied extensively on orchestral music, and Zappa's dissatisfaction with the classical music world intensified when a concert, scheduled at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] after filming, was canceled because a representative of the venue found some of the lyrics obscene</span>

				<span class='text'>]''; the latter included the 20-minute track &quot;[[Billy the Mountain]]&quot;, Zappa's satire on rock opera set in Southern California</span>
				<span class='text'>This track was representative of the band's theatrical performances—which used songs to build sketches based on ''200 Motels'' scenes, as well as new situations that often portrayed the band members' sexual encounters on the road</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;During the June 1971 Fillmore concerts Zappa was joined on stage by [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This performance was recorded, and Lennon released excerpts on his album ''[[Some Time in New York City]]'' in 1972</span>
				<span class='text'>Zappa later released his version of excerpts from the concert on ''[[Playground Psychotics]]'' in 1992, including the jam track &quot;Scumbag&quot; and an extended avant-garde vocal piece by Ono (originally called &quot;Au&quot;), which Zappa renamed &quot;A Small Eternity with Yoko Ono&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>title=Waka/Jawaka|pos=right}}In December 1971, Zappa suffered two serious setbacks</span>
				<span class='text'>While performing at [[Montreux Casino|Casino de Montreux]] in Switzerland, the Mothers' equipment was destroyed when a flare set off by an audience member started a fire that burned down the casino</span>

				<span class='text'>112–115</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Immortalized in [[Deep Purple]]'s song &quot;[[Smoke on the Water]]&quot;, the event and immediate aftermath can be heard on the bootleg album ''Swiss Cheese/Fire'', released legally as part of Zappa's ''[[Beat the Boots II]]'' compilation</span>
				<span class='text'>After a week's break, the Mothers played at the [[Rainbow (London)|Rainbow Theatre]], London, with rented gear</span>
				<span class='text'>During the encore, Trevor Howell, an audience member, pushed Zappa off the stage and into the concrete-floored orchestra pit</span>
				<span class='text'>The band thought Zappa had been killed—he had suffered serious fractures, head trauma and injuries to his back, leg, and neck, as well as a crushed [[larynx]], which ultimately caused his voice to drop a [[Major third|third]] after healing</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Rainbow&quot;/&gt;This accident resulted in an extended period of wheelchair confinement, making touring impossible for over half a year</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon return to the stage in September 1972, Zappa was still wearing a leg brace, had a noticeable limp and could not stand for very long while on stage</span>
				<span class='text'>Zappa noted that one leg healed &quot;shorter than the other&quot; (a reference later found in the lyrics of songs &quot;Zomby Woof&quot; and &quot;[[Dancin' Fool]]&quot;), resulting in chronic back pain</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Rainbow&quot;/&gt; Meanwhile, the Mothers were left in limbo and eventually formed the core of Flo and Eddie's band as they set out on their own</span>
				<span class='text'>uring 1971–72 Zappa released two strongly jazz-oriented solo LPs, ''[[Waka/Jawaka]]'' and ''[[The Grand Wazoo]]'', which were recorded during the forced layoff from concert touring, using floating line-ups of session players and Mothers alumni</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;MilesWazoo&quot;/&gt; His first effort was a series of concerts in September 1972 with a 20-piece [[big band]] referred to as the Grand Wazoo</span>
				<span class='text'>This was followed by a scaled-down version known as the Petit Wazoo that toured the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>for five weeks from October to December 1972</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Official recordings of these bands did not emerge until more than 30&amp;nbsp;years later on ''[[Wazoo (album)|Wazoo]]'' (2007) and ''[[Imaginary Diseases]]'' (2006), respectively</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===1973–75: Top 10 album===Zappa then formed and toured with smaller groups that variously included [[Ian Underwood]] (reeds, keyboards), [[Ruth Underwood]] (vibes, marimba), Sal Marquez (trumpet, vocals), [[Napoleon Murphy Brock]] (sax, flute and vocals), [[Bruce Fowler]] (trombone), [[Tom Fowler (musician)|Tom Fowler]] (bass), [[Chester Thompson]] (drums), [[Ralph Humphrey]] (drums), [[George Duke]] (keyboards, vocals), and [[Jean-Luc Ponty]] (violin)</span>

				<span class='text'>It also prevented Zappa having access to any of his previously recorded material during the trials</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In the mid-1970s Zappa prepared material for ''[[Läther]]'' (pronounced &quot;leather&quot;), a four-LP project</span>
				<span class='text'>''Läther'' encapsulated all the aspects of Zappa's musical styles—rock tunes, orchestral works, complex instrumentals, and Zappa's own trademark distortion-drenched guitar solos</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Slaven, 2003, ''Electric Don Quixote'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>248</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; A lawsuit between Zappa and Warner Bros</span>
				<span class='text'>followed, during which no Zappa material was released for more than a year</span>
				<span class='text'>Eventually, Warner Bros</span>
				<span class='text'>issued different versions of much of the ''Läther'' material in 1978 and 1979 as four individual albums (five full-length LPs) with limited [[promotion (marketing)|promotion]]</span>

				<span class='text'>''Läther'' was released posthumously in 1996</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;It remains debated whether Zappa had conceived the material as a four-LP set from the beginning, or only when approaching Mercury-Phonogram; see, e</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt;Although Zappa eventually gained the rights to all his material created under the MGM and Warner Bros</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; the various lawsuits meant that for a period Zappa's only income came from touring, which he therefore did extensively in 1975–77 with relatively small, mainly rock-oriented, bands</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;miles261&quot;/&gt; Drummer [[Terry Bozzio]] became a regular band member, Napoleon Murphy Brock stayed on for a while, and original Mothers of Invention bassist [[Roy Estrada]] joined</span>
