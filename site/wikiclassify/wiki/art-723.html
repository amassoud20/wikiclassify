				<span class='text'>810&lt;ref&gt;Eric Joseph Goldberg, ''Struggle for Empire: Kingship and Conflict Under Louis the German, 817-876'' (Ithaca, 2006), p</span>
				<span class='text'>27</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; – 28 August 876), also known as '''Louis II''', was a grandson of [[Charlemagne]] and the third son of the succeeding [[Frankish Emperor]] [[Louis the Pious]] and his first wife, [[Ermengarde of Hesbaye]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He received the appellation ''Germanicus'' shortly after his death in recognition of the fact that the bulk of his territory had been in the former [[Germania]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Louis II was made the [[Rulers of Bavaria|King of Bavaria]] from 817 following the Emperor Charlemagne's practice of bestowing a local kingdom on a family member who then served as one of his lieutenants and the local governor</span>
				<span class='text'>He ruled in Regensburg, the old capital of the Bavarii</span>
				<span class='text'>When his father, Louis I (called the Pious), partitioned the empire toward the end of his reign in 840, he was made King of [[East Francia]], a region that spanned the [[Elbe]] drainage basin from [[Jutland]] southeasterly through the [[Thuringerwald]] into modern Bavaria, from the [[Treaty of Verdun]] in 843 until his death</span>
				<span class='text'>=''Divisio imperii'' and filial rebellion==His early years were partly spent at the court of his grandfather, [[Charlemagne]], whose special affection he is said to have won</span>
				<span class='text'>When the emperor Louis divided his dominions between his sons in 817, Louis received [[Bavaria]] and the neighbouring lands but did not undertake the governing of such until 825, when he became involved in wars with the [[Wends]] and [[Sorbs]] on his eastern frontier</span>
				<span class='text'>In 827, he married [[Hemma|Emma of Altdorf]], sister of his stepmother [[Judith, daughter of Welf|Judith of Bavaria]], both daughters of [[Welf (father of Judith)|Welf]] whose possessions ranged from [[Alsace]] to Bavaria</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis soon began to interfere in the quarrels arising from Judith's efforts to secure a kingdom for her own son [[Charles the Bald|Charles]] (later known as Charles the Bald) and the consequent struggles of his brothers with their father</span>
				<span class='text'>is involvement in the first civil war of his father's reign was limited, but in the second, his elder brothers, Lothair, then [[King of Italy]], and [[Pepin I of Aquitaine|Pepin]], [[Duke of Aquitaine|King of Aquitaine]], induced him to invade [[Alamannia]] &amp;mdash; which their father had given to their half-brother Charles &amp;mdash; by promising to give him the land in the new partition they would make</span>
				<span class='text'> In 832, he led an army of [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]] into Alamannia and completely subjugated it</span>
				<span class='text'> Louis the Pious disinherited him, but to no effect; the emperor was captured by his own rebellious sons and deposed</span>
				<span class='text'> Upon his swift reinstatement, however, the Emperor Louis made peace with his son Louis and restored Bavaria (never actually lost) to him in 836</span>
				<span class='text'>n the third civil war (began 839) of his father's ruinous final decade, Louis was the instigator</span>
				<span class='text'> A strip of his land having been given to the young Charles, Louis invaded Alamannia again</span>
				<span class='text'> His father was not so sluggish in responding to him this time, and soon the younger Louis was forced into the far southeastern corner of his realm, the [[March of Pannonia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Peace had been made by force of arms</span>
				<span class='text'>=Civil war, 840&amp;ndash;843==When the elder Louis died in 840, and Lothair claimed the whole Empire, Louis allied with the half-brother, Charles the Bald, and defeated Lothair and their nephew [[Pepin II of Aquitaine]], son of Pepin, at the [[Battle of Fontenay (841)|Battle of Fontenay]] in June 841</span>
				<span class='text'>In June 842, the three brothers met on an island in the [[Saône]] to negotiate a peace, and each appointed forty representatives to arrange the boundaries of their respective kingdoms</span>
				<span class='text'>This developed into the [[Treaty of Verdun]], concluded in August 843, by which Louis received the bulk of the lands lying east of the [[Rhine]] ([[Eastern Francia]]), together with a district around [[Speyer]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], and [[Mainz]], on the left bank of the river (see also [[Oaths of Strasbourg]] 842)</span>
				<span class='text'>His territories included Bavaria (where he made [[Regensburg]] the centre of his government), [[Thuringia]], [[Franconia]], and [[Saxony]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He may truly be called the founder of the German kingdom, though his attempts to maintain the unity of the Empire proved futile</span>
				<span class='text'>Having in 842 crushed the ''[[Stellinga]]'' rising in Saxony, in 844 he compelled the [[Obotrites]] to own his authority and put their prince, Gozzmovil, to death</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Thachulf, Duke of Thuringia]], then undertook campaigns against the [[Bohemia]]ns, [[Great Moravia|Moravians]], and other tribes, but was not very successful in freeing his shores from the ravages of the [[Viking]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>=Conflict with Charles the Bald==In 852, he had sent his son [[Louis the Younger]] to Aquitaine, where the nobles had grown resentful of Charles the Bald's rule</span>
				<span class='text'>The younger Louis did not set out until 854, but he returned the following year</span>
				<span class='text'>In 853 and the following years, Louis made more than one attempt to secure the throne of [[Western Francia]], which, according to the ''Annals of [[Fulda]]'' (''[[Annales Fuldenses]]''), the people of that country offered him in their disgust with the cruel misrule of Charles the Bald</span>
				<span class='text'>Encouraged by his nephews Pepin II and [[Charles of Provence|Charles]], [[King of Burgundy|King of Provence]], Louis invaded in 858; Charles the Bald could not even raise an army to resist the invasion and fled to [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]]; in that year, Louis issued a charter dated &quot;the first year of the reign in West Francia</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Treachery and desertion in his army, and the loyalty to Charles of the Aquitanian bishops, brought about the failure of the enterprise, which Louis renounced by a treaty signed at [[Coblenz]] on 7 June 860</span>
				<span class='text'>{cn|date=June 2015}}In 855, the emperor Lothair died, and Louis and Charles for a time seem to have cooperated in plans to divide Lothair's possessions among themselves &amp;mdash; the only impediments to this being Lothair's sons: [[Lothair II of Lotharingia|Lothair II]] (who received [[Lotharingia]]), [[Louis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis II]] (who held the imperial title and the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy|Iron Crown]]), and the aforementioned Charles</span>
				<span class='text'>In 868, at [[Metz]] they agreed definitely to a partition of [[Lotharingia]]; but when Lothair II died in 869, Louis the German was lying seriously ill, and his armies were engaged with the Moravians</span>
				<span class='text'>Charles the Bald accordingly seized the whole kingdom; but Louis the German, having recovered, compelled him by a threat of war to agree to the [[Treaty of Meerssen]], which divided it between the claimants</span>
				<span class='text'>{cn|date=June 2015}}==''Divisio regni'' and his sons==The later years of Louis the German were troubled by risings on the part of his sons, the eldest of whom, [[Carloman of Bavaria|Carloman]], revolted in 861 and again two years later; an example that was followed by the second son Louis, who in a further rising was joined by his brother [[Charles the Fat|Charles]]</span>
				<span class='text'> In 864, Louis was forced to grant Carloman the kingdom of Bavaria, which he himself had once held under his father</span>
				<span class='text'> The next year (865), he divided the remainder of his lands: [[Saxony]] he gave to Louis the Younger (with [[Franconia]] and [[Thuringia]]) and [[Swabia]] (with [[Raetia]]) to Charles, called the Fat</span>
				<span class='text'>After taking [[Bari]] from the Saracens in 871, Louis was held hostage by Sergius of Naples, Waifar of Salerno, Lambert of Spoleto and Adelchis of Benevento</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  A report that the emperor Louis II (of Italy) was dead led to peace between father and sons and attempts by Louis the German to gain the imperial crown for Carloman</span>
				<span class='text'>These efforts were thwarted by Louis II, who was not in fact dead, and Louis' old adversary, Charles the Bald</span>
				<span class='text'>ouis was preparing for war when he died on 28 August 876 at [[Frankfurt]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was buried at the [[abbey]] of [[Lorsch]], leaving three sons and three daughters</span>
				<span class='text'> His sons, unusually for the times, respected the division made a decade earlier and each contented himself with his own kingdom</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis is considered by many to be the most competent of the grandsons of Charlemagne</span>
				<span class='text'>He obtained for his kingdom a certain degree of security in face of the attacks of [[Norsemen]], [[Hungarian people|Magyars]], Slavs, and others</span>
				<span class='text'>He lived in close alliance with the Church, to which he was very generous, and entered eagerly into schemes for the conversion of his [[Paganism|heathen]] neighbours</span>
				<span class='text'>{cn|date=June 2015}}==Marriage and children==He was married to [[Hemma]] (died 31 January 876)</span>
