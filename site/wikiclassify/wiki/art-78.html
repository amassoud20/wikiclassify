				<span class='text'>peg|thumb|180px|Blue-eyed [[Buddhism in Central Asia|Central Asian monk]] teaching an East Asian monk</span>
				<span class='text'>A fresco from the [[Bezeklik Thousand Buddha Caves]], dated to the 9th or 10th century</span>
				<span class='text'>]The earliest text mentioning Bodhidharma is ''The Record of the Buddhist Monasteries of [[Luoyang]]'' ({{zh|t=洛陽伽藍記}} ''Luòyáng Qiélánjì'') which was compiled in 547 by Yáng Xuànzhī (楊衒之), a writer and translator of [[Mahayana sutras]] into Chinese</span>
				<span class='text'>Yang gave the following account:{{quote|At that time there was a monk of the Western Region named Bodhidharma, a Persian Central Asian</span>
				<span class='text'>{refn|group=note|According to Jorgensen, the mentioning by Yáng Xuànzhī of Bodhidharma as Persian is mistaken, since Sassanian was not Buddhist</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Jorgensen|2000|p=159}}}} He traveled from the wild borderlands to China</span>
				<span class='text'>Seeing the golden disks [on the pole on top of Yǒngníng's [[stupa]] reflecting in the sun, the rays of light illuminating the surface of the clouds, the jewel-bells on the stupa blowing in the wind, the echoes reverberating beyond the heavens, he sang its praises</span>
				<span class='text'>He exclaimed: &quot;Truly this is the work of spirits</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He said: &quot;I am 150 years old, and I have passed through numerous countries</span>
				<span class='text'>There is virtually no country I have not visited</span>
				<span class='text'>Even the distant Buddha-realms lack this</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He chanted homage and placed his palms together in salutation for days on end</span>

				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|200px|A [[Blanc de Chine|Dehua ware]] porcelain statuette of Bodhidharma from the late [[Ming dynasty]], 17th century]]The second account was written by Tánlín (曇林; 506–574)</span>
				<span class='text'>Tánlín's brief biography of the &quot;[[Dharma]] Master&quot; is found in his preface to the ''[[Long Scroll of the Treatise on the Two Entrances and Four Practices]]'', a text traditionally attributed to Bodhidharma and the first text to identify him as [[Dravidian peoples|South Indian]]:{{quote|The Dharma Master was a South Indian of the Western Region</span>
				<span class='text'>He was the third son of a great Indian king</span>
				<span class='text'>His ambition lay in the Mahayana path, and so he put aside his white layman's robe for the black robe of a monk […] Lamenting the decline of the true teaching in the outlands, he subsequently crossed distant mountains and seas, traveling about propagating the teaching in Han and Wei</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Broughton|1999|p=8}}}}Tánlín's account was the first to mention that Bodhidharma attracted disciples,{{sfn|Broughton|1999|p=9}} specifically mentioning Dàoyù (道育) and [[Dazu Huike]] (慧可), the latter of whom would later figure very prominently in the Bodhidharma literature</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Tánlín has traditionally been considered a disciple of Bodhidharma, it is more likely that he was a student of Huìkě</span>

				<span class='text'>quot; It was created by [[Hakuin Ekaku]] (1685–1768)]]In the 7th-century historical work &quot;Further Biographies of Eminent Monks&quot; (續高僧傳 ''Xù gāosēng zhuàn''), [[Dàoxuān]] (道宣; 596-667) possibly drew on Tanlin's preface as a basic source, but made several significant additions:Firstly, Dàoxuān adds more detail concerning Bodhidharma's origins, writing that he was of &quot;South Indian [[Brahman]] stock&quot; (南天竺婆羅門種 ''nán tiānzhú póluómén zhŏng'')</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Dumoulin|Heisig|Knitter|2005|p=87}}Secondly, more detail is provided concerning Bodhidharma's journeys</span>
				<span class='text'>Tanlin's original is imprecise about Bodhidharma's travels, saying only that he &quot;crossed distant mountains and seas&quot; before arriving in Wei</span>
				<span class='text'>Dàoxuān's account, however, implies &quot;a specific itinerary&quot;:{{sfn|Broughton|1999|p=56}} &quot;He first arrived at [[Nanyue|Nan-yüeh]] during the [[Song dynasty|Sung period]]</span>
				<span class='text'>From there he turned north and came to the Kingdom of Wei&quot;{{sfn|Dumoulin|Heisig|Knitter|2005|p=87}} This implies that Bodhidharma had travelled to China by sea and that he had crossed over the [[Yangtze]]</span>
				<span class='text'>hirdly, Dàoxuān suggests a date for Bodhidharma's arrival in China</span>
				<span class='text'>He writes that Bodhidharma makes landfall in the time of the Song, thus making his arrival no later than the time of the Song's fall to the [[Southern Qi]] in 479</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Broughton|1999|p=56}}Finally, Dàoxuān provides information concerning Bodhidharma's death</span>
				<span class='text'>Bodhidharma, he writes, died at the banks of the [[Luo River (Henan)|Luo River]], where he was interred by his disciple Dazu Huike, possibly in a cave</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Dàoxuān's chronology, Bodhidharma's death must have occurred prior to 534, the date of the Northern Wei's fall, because Dazu Huike subsequently leaves Luoyang for [[Ye (ancient China)|Ye]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Furthermore, citing the shore of the Luo River as the place of death might possibly suggest that Bodhidharma died in [[Emperor Xiaozhuang of Northern Wei#The Heyin Massacre and aftermath|the mass executions at Heyin]] (河陰) in 528</span>
				<span class='text'>Supporting this possibility is a report in the [[Chinese Buddhist canon]] stating that a Buddhist monk was among the victims at Héyīn</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Broughton|1999|p=139}}=== Later accounts ===[[File:HK Museum of Art TST Bodhidharma figure 2</span>
				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|200px|Sculpture of Bodhidharma]]==== ''Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall'' ====In the ''Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall'' (祖堂集 ''Zǔtángjí'') of 952, the elements of the traditional Bodhidharma story are in place</span>
				<span class='text'>Bodhidharma is said to have been a disciple of [[Prajnatara|Prajñātāra]],{{sfn|Broughton|1999|p=2}} thus establishing the latter as the 27th patriarch in India</span>
				<span class='text'>After a three-year journey, Bodhidharma reached China in 527,{{sfn|Broughton|1999|p=2}} during the Liang (as opposed to the Song in Dàoxuān's text)</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall'' includes Bodhidharma's encounter with [[Emperor Wu of Liang]], which was first recorded around 758 in the appendix to a text by Shenhui (神會), a disciple of Huineng</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|McRae|2000}}Finally, as opposed to Daoxuan's figure of &quot;over 150 years,&quot;{{sfn|Dumoulin|Heisig|Knitter|2005|p=88}} the ''Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall'' states that Bodhidharma died at the age of 150</span>
				<span class='text'>He was then buried on Mount Xionger (熊耳山 ''Xióngĕr Shān'') to the west of Luoyang</span>
				<span class='text'>However, three years after the burial, in the [[Pamir Mountains]], Sòngyún (宋雲)—an official of one of the later Wei kingdoms—encountered Bodhidharma, who claimed to be returning to India and was carrying a single sandal</span>
				<span class='text'>Bodhidharma predicted the death of Songyun's ruler, a prediction which was borne out upon the latter's return</span>
				<span class='text'>Bodhidharma's tomb was then opened, and only a single sandal was found inside</span>
				<span class='text'>nsofar as, according to the ''Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall'', Bodhidharma left the Liang court in 527 and relocated to [[Mount Song]] near Luoyang and the Shaolin Monastery, where he &quot;faced a wall for nine years, not speaking for the entire time&quot;,{{sfn|Lin|1996|p=182}} his date of death can have been no earlier than 536</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, his encounter with the Wei official indicates a date of death no later than 554, three years before the fall of the [[Western Wei]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=== Dàoyuán – Transmission of the Lamp ====Subsequent to the ''Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall'', the only dated addition to the biography of Bodhidharma is in the ''[[Transmission of the Lamp|Jingde Records of the Transmission of the Lamp]]'' (景德傳燈錄 ''Jĭngdé chuándēng lù'', published 1004 [[Common Era|CE]]), by Dàoyuán (道原), in which it is stated that Bodhidharma's original name had been Bodhitāra but was changed by his master Prajñātāra</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Broughton|1999|p=119}} The same account is given by the Japanese master Keizan's 13th century work of the same title</span>

				<span class='text'>== Encounter with Emperor Xiāo Yǎn 蕭衍 ===The ''Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall'' says that in 527, Bodhidharma visited [[Emperor Wu of Liang]] (Xiāo Yǎn 蕭衍, posthumous name Wǔdì 武帝), a fervent patron of Buddhism:{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Emperor Wu: &quot;How much karmic merit have I earned for ordaining Buddhist monks, building monasteries, having sutras copied, and commissioning Buddha images?&quot;Bodhidharma: &quot;None</span>
