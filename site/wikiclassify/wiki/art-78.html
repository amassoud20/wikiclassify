				<span class='text'>hilippe Cornu Dictionnaire enclyclopédique du Bouddhisme  Biography There are two known extant accounts written by contemporaries of Bodhidharma</span>
				<span class='text'>The earliest text mentioning Bodhidharma is The Record of the Buddhist Monasteries of   Luòyáng Qiélánjì which was compiled in 547 by Yáng Xuànzhī 楊衒之 a writer and translator of  into Chinese</span>
				<span class='text'>Yang gave the following account The second account was written by Tánlín 曇林 506–574</span>
				<span class='text'>Tánlíns brief biography of the  Master is found in his pace to the  a text traditionally attributed to Bodhidharma and the first text to identify him as Tánlíns account was the first to mention that Bodhidharma attracted disciples specifically mentioning Dàoyù 道育 and  慧可 the latter of whom would later figure very prominently in the Bodhidharma literature</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Tánlín has traditionally been considered a disciple of Bodhidharma it is more likely that he was a student of Huìkě</span>
				<span class='text'>Tanlins pace has also been preserved in Jingjues 683 750 Lengjie Shizi ji Chronicle of the Laṅkāvatāra Masters which dates from 713 716</span>
				<span class='text'>ca</span>
				<span class='text'>715 He writes The teacher of the Dharma who came from South India in the Western Regions the third son of a great Brahman king</span>
				<span class='text'>In the 7th century historical work Further Biographies of Eminent Monks 續高僧傳 Xù gāosēng zhuàn  道宣 596 667 possibly drew on Tanlins pace as a basic source but made several significant additionsFirstly Dàoxuān adds more detail concerning Bodhidharmas origins writing that he was of South Indian  stock 南天竺婆羅門種 nán tiānzhú póluómén zhŏng</span>
				<span class='text'>econdly more detail is provided concerning Bodhidharmas journeys</span>
				<span class='text'>Tanlins original is imprecise about Bodhidharmas travels saying only that he crossed distant mountains and seas before arriving in Wei</span>
				<span class='text'>Dàoxuāns account however implies a specific itinerary He first arrived at  during the </span>
				<span class='text'>From there he turned north and came to the Kingdom of Wei This implies that Bodhidharma had travelled to China by sea and that he had crossed over the </span>
				<span class='text'>hirdly Dàoxuān suggests a date for Bodhidharmas arrival in China</span>
				<span class='text'>He writes that Bodhidharma makes landfall in the time of the Song thus making his arrival no later than the time of the Songs fall to the  in 479</span>
				<span class='text'>inally Dàoxuān provides information concerning Bodhidharmas death</span>
				<span class='text'>Bodhidharma he writes died at the banks of the  where he was interred by his disciple Dazu Huike possibly in a cave</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Dàoxuāns chronology Bodhidharmas death must have occurred prior to 534 the date of the Northern Weis fall because Dazu Huike subsequently leaves Luoyang for </span>
				<span class='text'>Furthermore citing the shore of the Luo River as the place of death might possibly suggest that Bodhidharma died in  河陰 in 528</span>
				<span class='text'>Supporting this possibility is a report in the  stating that a Buddhist monk was among the victims at Héyīn</span>
				<span class='text'>In the Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall 祖堂集 Zǔtángjí of 952 the elements of the traditional Bodhidharma story are in place</span>
				<span class='text'>Bodhidharma is said to have been a disciple of  thus establishing the latter as the 27th patriarch in India</span>
				<span class='text'>After a three year journey Bodhidharma reached China in 527 during the Liang as opposed to the Song in Dàoxuāns text</span>
				<span class='text'>The Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall includes Bodhidharmas encounter with  which was first recorded around 758 in the appendix to a text by Shenhui 神會 a disciple of Huineng</span>
				<span class='text'>inally as opposed to Daoxuans figure of over 150 years the Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall states that Bodhidharma died at the age of 150</span>
				<span class='text'>He was then buried on Mount Xionger 熊耳山 Xióngĕr Shān to the west of Luoyang</span>
				<span class='text'>However three years after the burial in the  Sòngyún 宋雲—an official of one of the later Wei kingdoms—encountered Bodhidharma who claimed to be returning to India and was carrying a single sandal</span>
				<span class='text'>Bodhidharma predicted the death of Songyuns ruler a prediction which was borne out upon the latters return</span>
				<span class='text'>Bodhidharmas tomb was then opened and only a single sandal was found inside</span>
				<span class='text'>nsofar as according to the Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall Bodhidharma left the Liang court in 527 and relocated to  near Luoyang and the Shaolin Monastery where he faced a wall for nine years not speaking for the entire time his date of death can have been no earlier than 536</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover his encounter with the Wei official indicates a date of death no later than 554 three years before the fall of the </span>
				<span class='text'>Subsequent to the Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall the only dated addition to the biography of Bodhidharma is in the  景德傳燈錄 Jĭngdé chuándēng lù published 1004  by Dàoyuán 道原 in which it is stated that Bodhidharmas original name had been Bodhitāra but was changed by his master Prajñātāra</span>
				<span class='text'>The same account is given by the Japanese master Keizans 13th century work of the same title</span>

				<span class='text'>An Indian tradition regards Bodhidharma to be the third son of a  from </span>
				<span class='text'>This is consistent with the Southeast Asian traditions which also describe Bodhidharma as a former n prince who had awakened his  and renounced royal life to become a monk</span>

				<span class='text'>After either being used entry or being ejected after a short time he lived in a nearby cave where he faced a wall for nine years not speaking for the entire time</span>
				<span class='text'>he biographical tradition is littered with apocryphal tales about Bodhidharmas life and circumstances</span>
				<span class='text'>In one version of the story he is said to have fallen asleep seven years into his nine years of wall gazing</span>
				<span class='text'>Becoming angry with himself he cut off his eyelids to prevent it from happening again</span>
				<span class='text'>According to the legend as his eyelids hit the floor the first  sprang up and thereafter  would provide a stimulant to help keep students of Chan awake during </span>
				<span class='text'>he most popular account relates that Bodhidharma was admitted into the Shaolin temple after nine years in the cave and taught there for some time</span>
				<span class='text'>However other versions report that he passed away seated upright or that he disappeared leaving behind the  or that his legs atrophied after nine years of sitting which is why s have no legs</span>

				<span class='text'>Bodhidharma then either returned to India or died</span>
				<span class='text'>ome Chinese accounts describe Bodhidharma as being disturbed by the poor physical shape of the Shaolin monks after which he instructed them in techniques to maintain their physical condition as well as teaching meditation</span>
				<span class='text'>He is said to have taught a series of external exercises called the  and an internal practice called the Sinew Metamorphosis Classic</span>

				<span class='text'>When asked why he was holding his shoe Bodhidharma answered You will know when you reach Shaolin monastery</span>
				<span class='text'>Dont mention that you saw me or you will meet with disaster</span>
				<span class='text'>After arriving at the palace Sòngyún told the emperor that he met Bodhidharma on the way</span>
				<span class='text'>The emperor said Bodhidharma was already dead and buried and had Sòngyún arrested for lying</span>
				<span class='text'>At Shaolin Monastery the monks informed them that Bodhidharma was dead and had been buried in a hill behind the temple</span>
				<span class='text'>The grave was exhumed and was found to contain a single shoe</span>
				<span class='text'>The monks then said Master has gone back home and prostrated three times For nine years he had remained and nobody knew him Carrying a shoe in hand he went home quietly without ceremony</span>

				<span class='text'>ne of the fundamental Chán texts attributed to Bodhidharma is a four line stanza whose first two verses echo the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtras disdain for words and whose second two verses stress the importance of the insight into reality achieved through self realizationThe stanza in fact is not Bodhidharmas but rather dates to the year 1108</span>

				<span class='text'>Given the present state of the sources he considers it impossible to compile a reliable account of Bodhidharmas life</span>

				<span class='text'>Given the ambiguity of geographical erences in writings of this period such a statement should not be taken too seriously</span>
				<span class='text'>Dumoulin considers Tan lins account of Bodhidharma being the third son of a great Brahman king to be a later addition and finds the exact meaning of South Indian Brahman stock unclear And when Tao hsuan speaks of origins from South Indian Brahman stock it is not clear whether he is erring to roots in nobility or to India in general as the land of the Brahmans</span>
				<span class='text'>hese Chinese sources lend themselves to make inferences about Bodhidharmas origins</span>
				<span class='text'>The third son of a Brahman king has been speculated to mean the third son of a Pallavine king</span>

				<span class='text'>According to Tsutomu Kambe Kanchi means a radiant jewel or a luxury belt with jewels and puram means a town or a state in the sense of earlier times</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus it is understood that the 香至 Kingdom corresponds to the old capital Kanchipuram</span>
