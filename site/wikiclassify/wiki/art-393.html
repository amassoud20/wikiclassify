				<span class='text'>To his admirers he was a courageous advocate for the rights of blacks, a man who indicted white America in the harshest terms for its crimes against black Americans; detractors accused him of preaching [[racism]] and violence</span>
				<span class='text'>He has been called one of the greatest and most influential [[African American]]s in history</span>

				<span class='text'>While in prison, Malcolm{{nbsp}}X became a member of the [[Nation of Islam]], and after his parole in 1952, quickly rose to become one of the organization's most influential leaders</span>
				<span class='text'>He served as the public face of the controversial group for a dozen years</span>
				<span class='text'>In his autobiography, Malcolm{{nbsp}}X wrote proudly of some of the social achievements the Nation made while he was a member, particularly its free [[Drug rehabilitation|drug rehabilitation program]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In keeping with the Nation's teachings, he promoted [[black supremacy]], advocated the [[Black separatism|separation of black and white Americans]], and rejected the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|civil rights movement]] for their emphasis on [[Racial integration|integration]]</span>

				<span class='text'>He and the Nation of Islam were described as hatemongers, black supremacists, racists, violence-seekers, segregationists, and a threat to improved race relations</span>

				<span class='text'>== NOI lack of response to LAPD violence ===In late 1961, there were violent confrontations between NOI members and police in South Central Los Angeles, and numerous Muslims were arrested</span>
				<span class='text'>They were acquitted, but tensions had been raised</span>
				<span class='text'>Just after midnight on April{{nbsp}}27, 1962, [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] officers raided Temple Number 27, randomly beating NOI members</span>
				<span class='text'>Seven Muslims were shot; one, Ronald Stokes, a Korean War veteran, was shot fatally after surrendering to police</span>
				<span class='text'>A number of Muslims were indicted after the event, but no charges were made against the police</span>
				<span class='text'>To Malcolm{{nbsp}}X, the desecration and violence demanded action, and he used what Farrakhan later called his &quot;gangsterlike past&quot; to rally the more hardened of the New York members to go to Los Angeles for direct action against the police</span>
				<span class='text'>He also spoke of the NOI starting to work with civil rights organizations, local black politicians, and religious groups</span>
				<span class='text'>Elijah Muhammad did not support him in any of these initiatives, claiming the other organizations would turn to NOI in time, and saying &quot;…you don't go to war over a provocation</span>
