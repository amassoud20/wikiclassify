				<span class='text'>Ieyasu was posthumously enshrined at [[Nikkō Tōshō-gū]] with the name {{nihongo|Tōshō Daigongen|東照大権現}}</span>
				<span class='text'>=Early life (1543–1556)==Tokugawa Ieyasu was born in [[Okazaki Castle]] in [[Mikawa Province|Mikawa]] on the 26th day of the twelfth month of the eleventh year of [[Tenbun]], according to the [[Japanese calendar]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Originally named '''Matsudaira Takechiyo''' (松平 竹千代), he was the son of [[Matsudaira Hirotada]] (松平 広忠), the [[daimyo]] of Mikawa of the [[Matsudaira clan]], and Odai-no-kata (於大の方, Lady Odai), the daughter of a neighbouring samurai lord, [[Mizuno Tadamasa]] (水野 忠政)</span>
				<span class='text'>His mother and father were step-siblings</span>
				<span class='text'>They were just 17 and 15 years old, respectively, when Ieyasu was born</span>
				<span class='text'>Two years later, Odai-no-kata was sent back to her family and the couple never lived together again</span>
				<span class='text'>As both husband and wife remarried and both went on to have further children, Ieyasu in the end had 11 half-brothers and sisters</span>
				<span class='text'>he Matsudaira family was split in 1550: one side wanted to be vassals of the [[Imagawa clan]], while the other side preferred the [[Oda clan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, much of Ieyasu's early years were spent in danger as wars with the Oda and Imagawa were fought</span>
				<span class='text'>This family feud was the reason behind the murder of Ieyasu's paternal grandfather, [[Matsudaira Kiyoyasu]] (松平 清康)</span>
				<span class='text'>Unlike his father and the majority of his branch of the family, Ieyasu's father, Hirotada, favored the Imagawa clan</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1548, when the Oda clan invaded Mikawa, Hirotada turned to Imagawa Yoshimoto, the head of the Imagawa clan, for help to repel the invaders</span>
				<span class='text'>Yoshimoto agreed under the condition that Hirotada send Ieyasu to [[Shizuoka, Shizuoka|Sunpu]] as a hostage</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Oda Nobuhide]], the leader of the Oda clan, learned of this arrangement and had Ieyasu abducted from his entourage en route to Sunpu</span>
				<span class='text'>Ieyasu was just five years old at the time</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> Screech explains&lt;blockquote&gt;Minamoto-no-Ieyasu was born in ''Tenbun'' 11, on the 26th day of the 12th month (1542) and he died in ''Genna'' 2, on the 17th day of the 4th month (1616); and thus, his contemporaries would have said that he lived 75 years</span>
				<span class='text'>In this period, children were considered one year old at birth and became two the following New Year's Day; and all people advanced a year that day, not on their actual birthday</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;Nobuhide threatened to execute Ieyasu unless his father severed all ties with the Imagawa clan</span>
				<span class='text'>Hirotada replied that sacrificing his own son would show his seriousness in his pact with the Imagawa clan</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite this refusal, Nobuhide chose not to kill Ieyasu, but instead held him for the next three years at the Mansho Temple in [[Nagoya]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1549, when Ieyasu was 6,&lt;ref name=&quot;screech85&quot;/&gt; his father Hirotada was murdered by his own treacherous vassals, who had been bribed by the Oda Clan</span>
				<span class='text'>At about the same time, Oda Nobuhide died during an epidemic</span>
				<span class='text'>The deaths dealt a heavy blow to the Oda clan</span>
				<span class='text'>An army under the command of Imagawa [[Sessai Choro|Sessai]] laid siege to the castle where [[Oda Nobuhiro]], Nobuhide's eldest son and the new head of the Oda, was living</span>
				<span class='text'>With the castle about to fall, Sessai offered a deal to [[Oda Nobunaga]], Nobuhide's second son</span>
				<span class='text'>Sessai offered to give up the siege if Ieyasu was handed over to the Imagawa</span>
				<span class='text'>Nobunaga agreed, and so Ieyasu (now nine) was taken as a hostage to Sunpu</span>
				<span class='text'>Here he lived a fairly good life as hostage and potentially useful future ally of the Imagawa clan until 1556 when he was age 13 years old</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;screech85&quot;/&gt;==Rise to power (1556–1584)==In 1556 he came of age, and, following tradition, changed his name from '''Matsudaira Takechiyo''' to '''Matsudaira Jirōsaburō Motonobu''' (松平 次郎三郎 元信)</span>
				<span class='text'>One year later, at the age of 13 (according to [[East Asian age reckoning]]), he married his first wife and changed his name again to '''Matsudaira Kurandonosuke Motoyasu''' (松平 蔵人佐 元康)</span>
				<span class='text'>Allowed to return to his native Mikawa, the Imagawa ordered him to fight the Oda clan in a series of battles</span>
				<span class='text'>Motoyasu fought his first battle at the [[Siege of Terabe]] and later succeeded in delivering supplies to a border fort through a bold night attack</span>
				<span class='text'>y 1560 the leadership of the Oda clan had passed to the brilliant leader [[Oda Nobunaga]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Imagawa Yoshimoto, leading a large Imagawa army (perhaps 20,000 strong) attacked the Oda clan territory</span>
				<span class='text'>Motoyasu with his Mikawa troops captured a fort at the border and then stayed there to defend it</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, Motoyasu and his men were not present at the [[Battle of Okehazama]] where Yoshimoto was killed by Nobunaga's surprise assault</span>
				<span class='text'>ith Yoshimoto dead, Motoyasu decided to ally with the Oda clan</span>
				<span class='text'>A secret deal was needed because Motoyasu's wife and infant son, [[Matsudaira Nobuyasu|Nobuyasu]], were held hostage in Sunpu by the Imagawa clan</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1561, Motoyasu openly broke with the Imagawa and captured the fortress of Kaminojo</span>
				<span class='text'>Motoyasu was then able to exchange his wife and son for the wife and daughter of the ruler of Kaminojo castle</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1563 Nobuyasu was married to Nobunaga's daughter [[Tokuhime]]</span>
				<span class='text'>or the next few years Motoyasu set to reform the Matsudaira clan and pacifying Mikawa</span>
				<span class='text'>He also strengthened his key vassals by awarding them land and castles in Mikawa</span>
				<span class='text'>They were: [[Honda Tadakatsu]], [[Ishikawa Kazumasa]], [[Kōriki Kiyonaga]], [[Hattori Hanzō]], [[Sakai Tadatsugu]], and [[Sakakibara Yasumasa]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Azukizaka 1564</span>
				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|An [[Ukiyo-e]] print depicting the [[Battle of Azukizaka (1564)|Battle of Azukizaka]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In his early days as daimyo of Mikawa Ieyasu had difficult relations with the Jōdō temples which escalated in 1563–64</span>
				<span class='text'>]Motoyasu defeated the military forces of the Mikawa Monto within Mikawa province at the [[Battle of Azukizaka (1564)|Battle of Azukizaka]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Monto were a warlike group of monks that were ruling [[Kaga Province]] and had many temples elsewhere in Japan</span>
				<span class='text'>They refused to obey Motoyasu's commands and so he went to war with them, defeating their troops and pulling down their temples</span>
				<span class='text'>In one battle, Motoyasu was nearly killed when he was struck by a bullet which did not penetrate his armour</span>
				<span class='text'>Both Motoyasu's Mikawa troops and the Monto forces were using the new gunpowder weapons which the Portuguese had introduced to Japan just 20 years earlier</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1567, he changed his name yet again, this time to '''Tokugawa Ieyasu'''</span>
				<span class='text'>By so doing, he claimed descent from the [[Minamoto clan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>No proof has actually been found for this alleged descent from [[Emperor Seiwa]]</span>

				<span class='text'>82</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Yet, his family name was changed with the permission of the Imperial Court, after writing a petition, and he was bestowed the title Mikawa-no-kami and the court rank of Jugoige</span>
				<span class='text'>eyasu remained an ally of Nobunaga and his Mikawa soldiers were part of Nobunaga's army which captured [[Kyoto]] in 1568</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time Ieyasu was expanding his own territory</span>
				<span class='text'>He and [[Takeda Shingen]], the head of the [[Takeda clan]] in [[Kai Province]] made an alliance for the purpose of conquering all the Imagawa territory</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1570, Ieyasu's troops captured [[Tōtōmi Province]] while Shingen's troops captured [[Suruga Province]] (including the Imagawa capital of Sunpu)</span>
				<span class='text'>eyasu ended his alliance with Takeda and sheltered their former enemy, [[Imagawa Ujizane]]; he also allied with [[Uesugi Kenshin]] of the Uesugi clan—an enemy of the Takeda clan</span>
				<span class='text'>Later that year, Ieyasu led 5,000 of his own men supporting Nobunaga at the [[Battle of Anegawa]] against the [[Azai clan|Azai]] and [[Asakura clan|Asakura]] clans</span>
				<span class='text'>n October 1571, Takeda Shingen, now allied with the [[Late Hōjō clan|Hōjō clan]], attacked the Tokugawa lands of Tōtōmi</span>
				<span class='text'>Ieyasu asked for help from Nobunaga, who sent him some 3,000 troops</span>
				<span class='text'>Early in 1573 the two armies met at the [[Battle of Mikatagahara]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Takeda army, under the expert direction of Shingen, hammered at Ieyasu's troops until they were broken</span>
				<span class='text'>Ieyasu fled with just 5 men to a nearby castle</span>
				<span class='text'>This was a major loss for Ieyasu, but Shingen was unable to exploit his victory because Ieyasu quickly gathered a new army and refused to fight Shingen again on the battlefield</span>
				<span class='text'>eyasu benefitted from the death of Takeda Shingen during a siege a year later early in 1573</span>
				<span class='text'>Shingen was succeeded by his less capable son [[Takeda Katsuyori]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1575, the Takeda army attacked Nagashino Castle in Mikawa province</span>
				<span class='text'>Ieyasu appealed to Nobunaga for help and the result was that Nobunaga personally came at the head of his very large army (about 30,000 strong)</span>
				<span class='text'>The Oda-Tokugawa force of 38,000 won a great victory on June 28, 1575, at the [[Battle of Nagashino]], though Takeda Katsuyori survived the battle and retreated back to Kai Province</span>
				<span class='text'>or the next seven years, Ieyasu and Katsuyori fought a series of small battles</span>
				<span class='text'>Ieyasu's troops managed to wrest control of Suruga province away from the Takeda clan</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1579, Ieyasu's wife, and his eldest son, [[Matsudaira Nobuyasu]], were accused by Nobunaga of conspiring with Takeda Katsuyori to assassinate Nobunaga, whose daughter [[Tokuhime]] (1559–1636) was married to Nobuyasu</span>
				<span class='text'>Ieyasu's wife was executed and Nobuyasu was forced to commit [[seppuku]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Ieyasu then named his third and favorite son, [[Tokugawa Hidetada]], as heir, since his second son was adopted by another rising power: [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], the future ruler of all Japan</span>
				<span class='text'>he end of the war with Takeda came in 1582 when a combined Oda-Tokugawa force attacked and conquered Kai Province</span>
				<span class='text'>Takeda Katsuyori, as well as his eldest son Takeda Nobukatsu, were defeated at the [[Battle of Temmokuzan]] and then committed [[seppuku]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n late 1582, Ieyasu was near [[Osaka]] and far from his own territory when he learned that Nobunaga had been assassinated by [[Akechi Mitsuhide]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Ieyasu managed the dangerous journey back to Mikawa, avoiding Mitsuhide's troops along the way, as they were trying to find and kill him</span>
				<span class='text'>One week after he arrived in Mikawa, Ieyasu's army marched out to take revenge on Mitsuhide</span>
				<span class='text'>But they were too late, as Hideyoshi—on his own—defeated and killed Akechi Mitsuhide at the [[Battle of Yamazaki]]</span>
				<span class='text'>he death of Nobunaga meant that some provinces, ruled by Nobunaga's vassals, were ripe for conquest</span>
				<span class='text'>The leader of Kai province made the mistake of killing one of Ieyasu's aides</span>
				<span class='text'>Ieyasu promptly invaded Kai and took control</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Hōjō Ujimasa]], leader of the Hōjō clan responded by sending his much larger army into [[Shinano Province|Shinano]] and then into Kai province</span>
				<span class='text'>No battles were fought between Ieyasu's forces and the large Hōjō army and, after some negotiation, Ieyasu and the Hōjō agreed to a settlement which left Ieyasu in control of both Kai and Shinano provinces, while the Hōjō took control of Kazusa province (as well as bits of both Kai and Shinano province)</span>
				<span class='text'>t the same time (1583) a war for rule over Japan was fought between [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] and [[Shibata Katsuie]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Ieyasu did not take a side in this conflict, building on his reputation for both caution and wisdom</span>
				<span class='text'>Hideyoshi defeated Katsuie at [[Battle of Shizugatake]]</span>
				<span class='text'>With this victory, Hideyoshi became the single most powerful [[daimyo]] in Japan</span>
				<span class='text'>=Ieyasu and Hideyoshi (1584–1598)=={{Main|Battle of Komaki and Nagakute}}[[File:Go board Hideyoshi Ieyasu Ryogenin M1868</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Hideyoshi and Ieyasu played [[Go (game)|Go]] on this board</span>
				<span class='text'>]In 1584, Ieyasu decided to support [[Oda Nobukatsu]], the eldest surviving son and heir of [[Oda Nobunaga]], against Hideyoshi</span>
				<span class='text'>This was a dangerous act and could have resulted in the annihilation of the Tokugawa</span>
				<span class='text'>okugawa troops took the traditional Oda stronghold of Owari; Hideyoshi responded by sending an army into Owari</span>
				<span class='text'>The Komaki Campaign was the only time any of the great unifiers of Japan fought each other</span>
				<span class='text'>The campaign proved indecisive and after months of fruitless marches and feints, Hideyoshi settled the war through negotiation</span>
				<span class='text'>First he made peace with Oda Nobukatsu, and then he offered a truce to Ieyasu</span>
				<span class='text'>The deal was made at the end of the year; as part of the terms Ieyasu's second son, O Gi Maru, became an adopted son of Hideyoshi</span>
				<span class='text'>eyasu's aide, [[Ishikawa Kazumasa]], chose to join the pre-eminent daimyo and so he moved to Osaka to be with Hideyoshi</span>
				<span class='text'>However, few other Tokugawa retainers followed this example</span>
				<span class='text'>ideyoshi was understandably distrustful of Ieyasu, and five years passed before they fought as allies</span>
				<span class='text'>The Tokugawa did not participate in Hideyoshi's successful invasions of [[Shikoku]] and [[Kyushu|Kyūshū]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1590 Hideyoshi attacked the last independent daimyo in Japan, [[Hōjō Ujimasa]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Hōjō clan ruled the eight provinces of the Kantō region in eastern Japan</span>
				<span class='text'>Hideyoshi ordered them to submit to his authority and they refused</span>
				<span class='text'>Ieyasu, though a friend and occasional ally of Ujimasa, joined his large force of 30,000 samurai with Hideyoshi's enormous army of some 160,000</span>
				<span class='text'>Hideyoshi attacked several castles on the borders of the Hōjō clan with most of his army laying siege to the castle at [[Siege of Odawara (1590)|Odawara]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Hideyoshi's army captured Odawara after six months (oddly for the time period, deaths on both sides were few)</span>
				<span class='text'>During this siege, Hideyoshi offered Ieyasu a radical deal</span>
				<span class='text'>He offered Ieyasu the eight [[Kantō region|Kantō]] provinces which they were about to take from the Hōjō in return for the five provinces that Ieyasu currently controlled (including Ieyasu's home province of Mikawa)</span>
				<span class='text'>Ieyasu accepted this proposal</span>
				<span class='text'>Bowing to the overwhelming power of the Toyotomi army, the Hōjō accepted defeat, the top Hōjō leaders killed themselves and Ieyasu marched in and took control of their provinces, so ending the clan's reign of over 100 years</span>
				<span class='text'>eyasu now gave up control of his five provinces (Mikawa, Tōtōmi, Suruga, Shinano, and Kai) and moved all his soldiers and vassals to the Kantō region</span>
				<span class='text'>He himself occupied the castle town of [[Edo]] in Kantō</span>
				<span class='text'>This was possibly the riskiest move Ieyasu ever made&amp;nbsp;— to leave his home province and rely on the uncertain loyalty of the formerly Hōjō samurai in Kantō</span>
				<span class='text'>In the end, it worked out brilliantly for Ieyasu</span>
				<span class='text'>He reformed the Kantō provinces, controlled and pacified the Hōjō samurai and improved the underlying economic infrastructure of the lands</span>
				<span class='text'>Also, because Kantō was somewhat isolated from the rest of Japan, Ieyasu was able to maintain a unique level of autonomy from Hideyoshi's rule</span>
				<span class='text'>Within a few years, Ieyasu had become the second most powerful daimyo in Japan</span>
				<span class='text'>There is a Japanese proverb which likely refers to this event: &quot;Ieyasu won the Empire by retreating</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sadler|Sadler]], p</span>
				<span class='text'>164</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In 1592, Hideyoshi invaded [[Korea]] as a prelude to his plan to attack [[China]] (see [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98)]] for more information about this campaign)</span>
				<span class='text'>The Tokugawa samurai never actually took part in this campaign, though in early 1593, Ieyasu himself was summoned to Hideyoshi's court in Nagoya (in [[Kyushu|Kyūshū]], different from the similarly spelled city in Owari Province) as a military advisor and given command of a body of troops meant as reserves for the Korean campaign</span>
				<span class='text'>He stayed in Nagoya off and on for the next five years</span>

				<span class='text'>n 1593, Hideyoshi fathered a son and [[heir]], [[Toyotomi Hideyori]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1598, with his health clearly failing, Hideyoshi called a meeting that would determine the [[Council of Five Elders]], who would be responsible for ruling on behalf of his son after his death</span>
				<span class='text'>The five that were chosen as regents ([[tairō]]) for Hideyori were [[Maeda Toshiie]], [[Mōri Terumoto]], [[Ukita Hideie]], [[Uesugi Kagekatsu]], and Ieyasu himself, who was the most powerful of the five</span>
				<span class='text'>This change in the pre-Sekigahara power structure became pivotal as Ieyasu turned his attention towards [[Kansai region|Kansai]]; and at the same time, other ambitious (albeit ultimately unrealized) plans, such as the Tokugawa initiative establishing official relations with Mexico (New Spain at the time), continued to unfold and advance</span>

				<span class='text'>He was nominally succeeded by his young son [[Toyotomi Hideyori|Hideyori]] but as he was just five years old, real power was in the hands of the regents</span>
				<span class='text'>Over the next two years Ieyasu made alliances with various daimyo, especially those who had no love for Hideyoshi</span>
				<span class='text'>Happily for Ieyasu, the oldest and most respected of the regents, Toshiie Maeda, died after just one year</span>
				<span class='text'>With the death of Toshiie in 1599, Ieyasu led an army to [[Fushimi, Kyoto|Fushimi]] and took over [[Osaka Castle]], the residence of Hideyori</span>
				<span class='text'>This angered the three remaining regents and plans were made on all sides for war</span>
				<span class='text'>It was also the last battle of one of the most loyal and powerful retainer of Ieyasu, Honda Tadakatsu</span>

				<span class='text'>It is not clear why Ieyasu protected a powerful enemy from his own men but Ieyasu was a master strategist and he may have concluded that he would be better off with Mitsunari leading the enemy army rather than one of the regents, who would have more legitimacy</span>

				<span class='text'>187&lt;/ref&gt;Nearly all of Japan's daimyo and samurai now split into two factions—The Western Army (Mitsunari's group) and The Eastern Army (anti-Mitsunari Group)</span>
				<span class='text'>Ieyasu supported the anti-Mitsunari Group, and formed them as his potential allies</span>
				<span class='text'>Ieyasu's allies were the [[Date clan]], the [[Mogami clan]], the [[Satake clan]] and the [[Maeda clan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Mitsunari allied himself with the three other regents: [[Ukita Hideie]], [[Mori Terumoto]], and [[Uesugi Kagekatsu]] as well as many daimyo from the eastern end of Honshū</span>
				<span class='text'>n June 1600, Ieyasu and his allies moved their armies to defeat the [[Uesugi clan]], which was accused of planning to revolt against Toyotomi administration</span>
				<span class='text'>Before arriving at Uesugi's territory, Ieyasu received information that Mitsunari and his allies had moved their army against Ieyasu</span>
				<span class='text'>Ieyasu held a meeting with the daimyo, and they agreed to follow Ieyasu</span>

				<span class='text'>A battle against Sanada Masayuki in [[Shinano Province]] delayed Hidetada's forces, and they did not arrive in time for the main battle</span>
				<span class='text'>his battle was the biggest and one of the most important [[List of Japanese battles|battles]] in Japanese feudal history</span>

				<span class='text'>Toyotomi Hideyori (the son of Hideyoshi) lost most of his territory which were under management of western daimyo, and he was degraded to an ordinary daimyo, not a ruler of Japan</span>
				<span class='text'>In later years the vassals who had pledged allegiance to Ieyasu before Sekigahara became known as the ''[[fudai]]'' daimyo, while those who pledged allegiance to him after the battle (in other words, after his power was unquestioned) were known as ''[[tozama]]'' daimyo</span>

				<span class='text'>ollowing a well established Japanese pattern, Ieyasu abdicated his official position as shogun in 1605</span>

				<span class='text'>There may have been several factors that contributed to his decision, including his desire to avoid being tied up in ceremonial duties, to make it harder for his enemies to attack the real power center, and to secure a smoother succession of his son</span>

				<span class='text'>He was now a young daimyo living in Osaka Castle</span>
				<span class='text'>Many samurai who opposed Ieyasu rallied around Hideyori, claiming that he was the rightful ruler of Japan</span>
				<span class='text'>Ieyasu found fault with the opening ceremony of a temple built by Hideyori; it was as if he prayed for Ieyasu's death and the ruin of the Tokugawa clan</span>
				<span class='text'>Ieyasu ordered Toyotomi to leave Osaka Castle, but those in the castle refused and summoned samurai to gather within the castle</span>
				<span class='text'>Then the Tokugawa, with a huge army led by [[Ogosho Ieyasu]] and [[Tokugawa Hidetada|Shogun Hidetada]], laid siege to Osaka castle in what is now known as &quot;the Winter Siege of Osaka&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Eventually, Tokugawa was able to precipitate negotiations and an armistice after directed cannon fire threatened Hideyori's mother, [[Yodo-dono]]</span>

				<span class='text'>]Ieyasu had a number of qualities that enabled him to rise to power</span>
				<span class='text'>He was both careful and bold—at the right times, and at the right places</span>
				<span class='text'>Calculating and subtle, Ieyasu switched alliances when he thought he would benefit from the change</span>
				<span class='text'>He allied with the [[Late Hōjō clan]]; then he joined Hideyoshi's army of conquest, which destroyed the Hōjō; and he himself took over their lands</span>
				<span class='text'>In this he was like other daimyo of his time</span>
				<span class='text'>This was an era of violence, sudden death, and betrayal</span>
				<span class='text'>He was not very well liked nor personally popular, but he was feared and he was respected for his leadership and his cunning</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, he wisely kept his soldiers out of [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592-1598)|Hideyoshi's campaign in Korea]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=February 2015}}He was capable of great loyalty: once he allied with Oda Nobunaga, he never went against him, and both leaders profited from their long alliance</span>
				<span class='text'>He was known for being loyal towards his personal friends and vassals, whom he rewarded, He was said to have a close friendship with his vassal [[Hattori Hanzo]]</span>
				<span class='text'>However, he also remembered those who had wronged him in the past</span>
				<span class='text'>It is said that Ieyasu executed a man who came into his power because he had insulted him when Ieyasu was young</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=February 2015}}Ieyasu protected many former Takeda retainers from the wrath of Oda Nobunaga, who was known to harbor a bitter grudge towards the Takeda</span>
				<span class='text'>He managed to successfully transform many of the retainers of the Takeda, Hōjō, and Imagawa clans—all whom he had defeated himself or helped to defeat—into loyal followers</span>
				<span class='text'> At the same time, he could be ruthless when crossed</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, he ordered the executions of his first wife and his eldest son—a son-in-law of [[Oda Nobunaga]]; Oda was also an uncle of Hidetada's wife Oeyo</span>
				<span class='text'>{{citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=February 2015}}He was cruel, relentless and merciless in the elimination of Toyotomi survivors after Osaka</span>

				<span class='text'>Historically, Ieyasu was away from his lord at the time and, when he heard that Nobunaga was in danger, he wanted to rush to his lord's rescue in spite of the small number of attendants with him</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Tadakatsu advised for his lord to avoid the risk and urged for a quick retreat to Mikawa</span>

				<span class='text'>While they usually accept the historically known facts about Ieyasu's actions during Mitsuhide's betrayal, theorists tend to pay more attention to the events before</span>
				<span class='text'>Ever since Ieyasu lost his wife and son due to Nobunaga's orders, they reason, he held a secret resentment against his lord</span>
				<span class='text'>Generally, there is some belief that he privately goaded Mitsuhide to take action when the two warlords were together in [[Azuchi Castle]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Together, they planned when to attack and went their separate ways</span>
				<span class='text'>When the deed was done, Ieyasu turned a blind eye to Mitsuhide's schemes and fled the scene to feign innocence</span>
