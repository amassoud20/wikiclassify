				<span class='text'>ittle is known of Bosch's life, though there are some records</span>
				<span class='text'> He spent most of it in the town of [['s-Hertogenbosch]], where he was born in his grandfather's house</span>
				<span class='text'>The roots of his forefathers are in [[Aachen]], in present-day Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>His pessimistic and fantastical style cast a wide influence on northern art of the 16th century,(7) with [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] being his best known follower</span>
				<span class='text'>His paintings have been difficult to translate from a modern point of view; attempts to associate instances of modern sexual imagery with fringe sects or the occult have largely failed</span>
				<span class='text'>Today he is seen as a hugely individualistic painter with deep insight into man's desires and deepest fears</span>
				<span class='text'>Attribution has been especially difficult; today only about 25 paintings(7) are confidently given to his hand</span>
				<span class='text'>His most acclaimed works consist of a few [[triptych]] altarpieces, the most outstanding of which is ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>=Life==[[File:Jheronimus Bosch 050</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|200px|''[[Death and the Miser]]'', [[National Gallery of Art]], DC]]Hieronymus Bosch was born Jheronimus (or Joen,&lt;ref&gt;Dijck (2000): pp</span>
				<span class='text'>43-44</span>
				<span class='text'>A variant on his Middle Dutch name is &quot;Jeroen&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Van Dijck points out that in all contemporary sources the name &quot;Jeroen&quot; is used twice, while the name &quot;Joen&quot; is used nine times, making &quot;Joen&quot; to be his probable Christian name</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; respectively the Latin and [[Middle Dutch]] form of the name &quot;Jerome&quot;) van Aken (meaning &quot;from [[Aachen]]&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>He signed a number of his paintings as ''Jheronimus Bosch''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Signed works by Bosch include ''[[The Epiphany (Bosch)|The Adoration of the Magi]]'', ''[[Saint Christopher Carrying the Christ Child]]'', ''[[St</span>
				<span class='text'>John the Evangelist on Patmos]]'', ''[[The Temptation of St Anthony (Bosch painting)|The Temptation of Saint Anthony]]'', ''[[The Hermit Saint|The Hermit Saints Triptych]]'', and ''[[The Crucifixion of St Julia]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The name derives from his birthplace, {{nowrap|[['s-Hertogenbosch]]}}, which is commonly called &quot;Den Bosch&quot; ('the forest')</span>
				<span class='text'>ittle is known of Bosch's life or training</span>
				<span class='text'>He left behind no letters or diaries, and what has been identified has been taken from brief references to him in the municipal records of {{nowrap|'s-Hertogenbosch}}, and in the account books of the local order of the [[Illustrious Brotherhood of Our Blessed Lady]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Nothing is known of his personality or his thoughts on the meaning of his art</span>
				<span class='text'>Bosch’s date of birth has not been determined with certainty</span>
				<span class='text'>It is estimated at {{nowrap|{{circa}} 1450}} on the basis of a hand drawn portrait (which may be a self-portrait) made shortly before his death in 1516</span>
				<span class='text'>The drawing shows the artist at an advanced age, probably in his late sixties</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gibson, 15-16&lt;/ref&gt;Bosch was born and lived all his life in and near {{nowrap|'s-Hertogenbosch}}, a city in the [[Duchy of Brabant]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His grandfather, Jan van Aken (died 1454), was a painter and is first mentioned in the records in 1430</span>
				<span class='text'>7) It is known that Jan had five sons, four of whom were also painters</span>
				<span class='text'>Bosch's father, Anthonius van Aken (died {{circa}} 1478), acted as artistic adviser to the [[Illustrious Brotherhood of Our Blessed Lady]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gibson, 15, 17&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally assumed that either Bosch’s father or one of his uncles taught the artist to paint, but none of their works survive</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gibson, 19&lt;/ref&gt; Bosch first appears in the municipal record on 5 April 1474, when he is named along with two brothers and a sister</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|360px|left|''[[The Crucifixion of St Julia]]'', c 1497]]'s-Hertogenbosch was a flourishing city in 15th-century [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], in the south of the present-day Netherlands, at the time part of the [[Burgundian Netherlands]], and during its lifetime passing through marriage to the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1463(7), 4,000 houses in the town were destroyed by a catastrophic fire, which the then (approximately) 13-year-old Bosch presumably witnessed</span>
				<span class='text'>He became a popular painter in his lifetime and often received commissions from abroad</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1488 he joined the highly respected Brotherhood of Our Lady, an arch-conservative religious group of some 40 influential citizens of {{nowrap|'s-Hertogenbosch}}, and 7,000 'outer-members' from around Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>7)Sometime between 1479(7) and 1481(7), Bosch married Aleyt Goyaerts van den Meerveen, who was a few years his senior</span>
				<span class='text'>The couple moved to the nearby town of Oirschot, where his wife had inherited a house and land from her wealthy family</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; An entry in the accounts of the Brotherhood of Our Lady records Bosch’s death in 1516(17)</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|400px|''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]'' in the [[Museo del Prado]] in [[Madrid]]]]Bosch produced at least sixteen triptychs, of which eight are fully intact, and another five in fragments</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, 1010&lt;/ref&gt; His most famous triptych is the ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]'' whose inner panels are intended to be read chronologically from left to right</span>
				<span class='text'>In the left hand panel God presents Eve to Adam; innovatively God is given a youthful appearance</span>
				<span class='text'>The figures are set in a landscape populated by exotic animals and unusual semi-organic hut-shaped forms</span>
				<span class='text'>The central panel is a  broad panorama teeming with socially engaged nude figures seemingly engaged in innocent, self-absorbed joy, as well as fantastical animals, oversized fruit and hybrid stone formations</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Fraenger, 10&lt;/ref&gt;The right panel presents a hellscape; a world in which humankind has succumbed to the temptations of evil and is reaping eternal damnation</span>
				<span class='text'>Set at night, the panel features cold colours, tortured figures and frozen waterways</span>
				<span class='text'>The nakedness of the human figures has lost any eroticism suggested in the central panel,&lt;ref&gt;Belting, 38&lt;/ref&gt; as large explosions in the background throw light through the city gate and spill onto the water in the panel's midground</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gibson, 92&lt;/ref&gt;Bosch painted in a comparatively sketchy manner, contrasting with the traditional [[Flemish painting|Flemish style]] of painting in which the smooth surface—achieved by the application of multiple transparent glazes—conceals the brushwork</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Last judgement Bosch</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|400px|left|''[[The Last Judgment (Bosch triptych)|The Last Judgment]]'']]Bosch's paintings with their rough surfaces, so called ''[[impasto]]'' painting, differed from the tradition of the great Netherlandish painters of the end of the 15th, and beginning of the 16th centuries, who wished to hide the work done and so suggest their paintings as more nearly divine creations</span>

				<span class='text'>About 25 paintings remain today that can be attributed to him</span>
				<span class='text'>In the late sixteenth century, [[Philip II of Spain]] acquired many of Bosch's paintings, including some probably commissioned and collected by Spaniards active in Bosch's hometown; as a result, the [[Museo del Prado|Prado Museum]] in [[Madrid]] now owns ''The Adoration of the Magi'', ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]'', the tabletop painting of ''[[The Seven Deadly Sins and the Four Last Things]]'', ''[[The Haywain Triptych]]'' and ''[[Cutting the Stone|The Stone Operation]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>Rotterdam, [[Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen]]]]In the 20th century, when changing artistic tastes made artists like Bosch more palatable to the European imagination, it was sometimes argued that Bosch's art was inspired by heretical points of view (e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> the ideas of the [[Cathars]] and putative [[Adamites]]) as well as by obscure hermetic practices</span>
				<span class='text'>Again, since [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]] had been educated at one of the houses of the [[Brethren of the Common Life]] in 's-Hertogenbosch, and the town was religiously progressive, some writers have found it unsurprising that strong parallels exist between the caustic writing of Erasmus and the often bold painting of Bosch</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Although the Brethren remained loyal to the Pope, they still saw it as their duty to denounce the abuses and scandalous behavior of many priests: the corruption which both Erasmus and Bosch satirised in their work&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''The Secret Life of Paintings''</span>
				<span class='text'>Richard Foster &amp; Pamela Tudor-Craig ISBN 0-85115-439-5&lt;/ref&gt;Others, following a strain of Bosch-interpretation datable already to the 16th century, continued to think his work was created merely to titillate and amuse, much like the &quot;[[grotesque|grotteschi]]&quot; of the [[Italian Renaissance]]</span>
				<span class='text'>While the art of the older masters was based in the physical world of everyday experience, Bosch confronts his viewer with, in the words of the art historian Walter Gibson, &quot;a world of dreams [and] nightmares in which forms seem to flicker and change before our eyes&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>In one of the first known accounts of Bosch's paintings, in 1560 (6,1,5,7)the Spaniard [[Felipe de Guevara]] wrote that Bosch was regarded merely as &quot;the inventor of [[monster]]s and [[Chimera (mythology)|chimeras]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>In the early seventeenth century, the artist-biographer [[Karel van Mander]] described Bosch’s work as comprising &quot;wondrous and strange fantasies&quot;; however, he concluded that the paintings are &quot;often less pleasant than gruesome to look at&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gibson, 9&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:The Hay Wain by Hieronymus Bosch</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|600px|left|''[[The Haywain Triptych]]'', c 1516</span>
				<span class='text'>Prado, Madrid]]In recent decades, scholars have come to view Bosch's vision as less fantastic, and accepted that his art reflects the orthodox religious belief systems of his age</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Bosing&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bosing|first1=Walter|title=Hieronymus Bosch|date=1987|publisher=Taschen}}&lt;/ref&gt; His depictions of sinful humanity and his conceptions of Heaven and Hell are now seen as consistent with those of late medieval [[didactic]] literature and sermons</span>
				<span class='text'>Most writers attach a more profound significance to his paintings than had previously been supposed, and attempt to interpret it in terms of a late medieval morality</span>
				<span class='text'>It is generally accepted that Bosch's art was created to teach specific moral and spiritual truths in the manner of other [[Northern Renaissance]] figures, such as the poet [[Robert Henryson]], and that the images rendered have precise and premeditated significance</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Dirk Bax, Bosch's paintings often represent visual translations of verbal metaphors and puns drawn from both biblical and folkloric sources</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bax, 1949</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; However, the conflict of interpretations that his works still elicit raises profound questions about the nature of &quot;ambiguity&quot; in art of his period</span>
				<span class='text'>atterly art historians have added a further dimension to the subject of ambiguity in Bosch's work, emphasizing ironic tendencies, for example in ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]'', both in the central panel (delights),&lt;ref&gt;Pokorny (2010), 23, 25, 31</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and the right panel (hell)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Boulboullé (2008), 68, 70-72, 75-76</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; They theorize that the irony offers the option of detachment, both from the real world and from the painted fantasy world, thus appealing to both conservative and progressive viewers</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; on Bosch's paintings alleges that they actually conceal a strong nationalist consciousness, censuring the foreign imperial government of the [[Burgundian Netherlands]], especially [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian Habsburg]]</span>
				<span class='text'>By systematically superimposing images and concepts, the study asserts that Bosch also made his expiatory self-punishment, for he was accepting well-paid commissions from the Habsburgs and their deputies, and therefore betraying the memory of [[Charles the Bold]]</span>

				<span class='text'>1520,(7) one of the paintings with disputed attribution, in the [[Princeton University Art Museum]]]]The exact number of Bosch's surviving works has been a subject of considerable debate</span>
				<span class='text'>He signed only seven of his paintings, and there is uncertainty whether all the paintings once ascribed to him were actually from his hand</span>
				<span class='text'>It is known that from the early 16th century onwards numerous copies and variations of his paintings began to circulate</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, his style was highly influential, and was widely imitated by his numerous followers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gibson, 163&lt;/ref&gt;Over the years, scholars have attributed to him fewer and fewer of the works once thought to be his</span>
				<span class='text'>This is partly a result of technological advances such as reflectography, which enable researchers to examine a painting's underdrawing</span>
				<span class='text'>Art historians of the early- and mid-20th century, such as [[Charles de Tolnay|Tolnay]] and [[Ludwig von Baldass|Baldass]], identified between 30 and 50 paintings that they believed to be by Bosch's hand,&lt;ref name=&quot;Muller_1997&quot;/&gt; while a later monograph by Gerd Unverfehrt (1980) attributed only 25 paintings (7) and 14 drawings to him</span>
