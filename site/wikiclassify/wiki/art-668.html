				<span class='text'> related effect was measured by economist Jennifer Brown of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] who found that other golfers played worse when competing against Woods than when he was not in the tournament</span>
				<span class='text'>The scores of highly skilled (exempt) golfers are nearly one stroke higher when playing against Woods</span>
				<span class='text'>This effect was larger when he was on winning streaks and disappeared during his well-publicized slump in 2003–04</span>
				<span class='text'>Brown explains the results by noting that competitors of similar skill can hope to win by increasing their level of effort, but that, when facing a &quot;superstar&quot; competitor, extra exertion does not significantly raise one's level of winning while increasing risk of injury or exhaustion, leading to reduced effort</span>
