				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;MacKay pp23-24&quot; /&gt; In 1836, the family moved to a larger house in Edgar Street (opposite Reid's Park), following the demand for more heavy damask from which his father, William Carnegie, benefited</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;MacKay pp23-24&quot; /&gt; His uncle, George Lauder Sr</span>
				<span class='text'> a Scottish political leader, deeply influenced him as boy by introducing him to the writings of [[Robert Burns]] and historical Scottish heroes such as [[Robert the Bruce]], [[William Wallace]], and [[Robert Roy MacGregor|Rob Roy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Lauder's son, also named [[George Lauder (Scottish industrialist)|George Lauder]], grew up with Andrew and would become his business partner</span>
				<span class='text'>When Carnegie was thirteen, his father had fallen on very hard times as a handloom weaver and with the country in starvation</span>
				<span class='text'>His mother helped support the family by assisting her brother who was a cobbler and selling potted meats at her &quot;sweetie shop&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'> She eventually became the primary breadwinner by the 1840s</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Nasaw /&gt; Struggling to make ends meet, the Carnegies then decided to move with his family to [[Allegheny, Pennsylvania]], in the United States in 1848 for the prospect of a better life</span>

				<span class='text'>He made many connections this way</span>
				<span class='text'>He also paid close attention to his work, and quickly learned to distinguish the differing sounds the incoming telegraph signals produced</span>
				<span class='text'>He developed the ability to translate signals by ear, without using the paper slip,&lt;ref&gt;''[[#Autobiography|Autobiography]]'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>56, 59&lt;/ref&gt; and within a year was promoted to operator</span>
				<span class='text'>Carnegie's education and passion for reading was given a great boost by Colonel James Anderson, who opened his personal library of 400 volumes to working boys each Saturday night</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''[[#Autobiography|Autobiography]]'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>45&lt;/ref&gt; Carnegie was a consistent borrower and a &quot;self-made man&quot; in both his economic development and his intellectual and cultural development</span>
				<span class='text'>He was so grateful to Colonel Anderson for the use of his library that he &quot;resolved, if ever wealth came to me, [to see to it] that other poor boys might receive opportunities similar to those for which we were indebted to the noble man</span>

				<span class='text'>tarting in 1853, [[Tom Scott (PRR)|Thomas A</span>
				<span class='text'>Scott]] of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad Company]] employed Carnegie as a secretary/telegraph operator at a salary of $4</span>
				<span class='text'>0 per week</span>
				<span class='text'>Carnegie accepted this job with the railroad as he saw more prospects for career growth and experience with the railroad than with the telegraph company</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Nasaw&quot; /&gt; At age 18, the precocious youth began a rapid advance through the company, becoming the superintendent of the Pittsburgh Division</span>
				<span class='text'>His employment by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company would be vital to his later success</span>
				<span class='text'>The railroads were the first big businesses in America, and the Pennsylvania was one of the largest of them all</span>
				<span class='text'>Carnegie learned much about management and cost control during these years, and from Scott in particular</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Nasaw&quot;&gt;[[#Nasaw|Nasaw]], pp</span>
				<span class='text'>54–59, 64–65</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Scott also helped him with his first investments</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of these were part of the corruption indulged in by Scott and the Pennsylvania's president, [[John Edgar Thomson]], which consisted of inside trading in companies that the railroad did business with, or payoffs made by contracting parties &quot;as part of a [[quid pro quo]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Nasaw_pg59_60&quot;&gt;[[#Nasaw|Nasaw]], pp</span>
				<span class='text'>59–60&lt;/ref&gt; In 1855, Scott made it possible for Carnegie to invest $500 in the [[Adams Express Company|Adams Express]], which contracted with the Pennsylvania to carry its messengers</span>
				<span class='text'>The money was secured by his mother's placing a $600 mortgage on the family's $700 home, but the opportunity was available only because of Carnegie's close relationship with Scott</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Nasaw_pg59_60&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[#Autobiography|Autobiography]]'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>79&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later, he received a few shares in [[Theodore Tuttle Woodruff]]'s sleeping car company, as a reward for holding shares that Woodruff had given to Scott and Thomson, as a payoff</span>
				<span class='text'>Reinvesting his returns in such inside investments in railroad-related industries: (iron, bridges, and [[Track (rail transport)|rails]]), Carnegie slowly accumulated capital, the basis for his later success</span>
				<span class='text'>Throughout his later career, he made use of his close connections to Thomson and Scott, as he established businesses that supplied rails and bridges to the railroad, offering the two men a stake in his enterprises</span>
				<span class='text'>==1860–1865: The Civil War===Before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Carnegie arranged a merger between Woodruff's company and that of [[George Pullman]], the inventor of a [[sleeping car]] for [[first class travel]] which facilitated business travel at distances over {{convert|500|mi|km}}</span>
				<span class='text'>The investment proved a great success and a source of profit for Woodruff and Carnegie</span>
				<span class='text'>The young Carnegie continued to work for the Pennsylvania's Tom Scott, and introduced several improvements in the service</span>
				<span class='text'>n spring 1861, Carnegie was appointed by Scott, who was now Assistant Secretary of War in charge of military transportation, as Superintendent of the Military Railways and the Union Government's telegraph lines in the East</span>
				<span class='text'>Carnegie helped open the rail lines into Washington D</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>that the rebels had cut; he rode the locomotive pulling the first brigade of Union troops to reach Washington D</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Following the defeat of Union forces at [[First Battle of Bull Run|Bull Run]], he personally supervised the transportation of the defeated forces</span>
				<span class='text'>Under his organization, the telegraph service rendered efficient service to the Union cause and significantly assisted in the eventual victory</span>
				<span class='text'>Carnegie later joked that he was &quot;the first casualty of the war&quot; when he gained a scar on his cheek from freeing a trapped telegraph wire</span>
				<span class='text'>efeat of the Confederacy required vast supplies of [[munition]]s, as well as railroads (and telegraph lines) to deliver the goods</span>
				<span class='text'>The war demonstrated how integral the industries were to American success</span>
				<span class='text'>==Keystone Bridge Company===In 1864, Carnegie invested $40,000 in Story Farm on Oil Creek in [[Venango County, Pennsylvania]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In one year, the farm yielded over $1,000,000 in cash dividends, and petroleum from oil wells on the property sold profitably</span>
				<span class='text'>The demand for iron products, such as armor for gunboats, cannons, and shells, as well as a hundred other industrial products, made Pittsburgh a center of wartime production</span>
				<span class='text'>Carnegie worked with others in establishing a steel [[rolling mill]], and steel production and control of industry became the source of his fortune</span>
				<span class='text'>Carnegie had some investments in the iron industry before the war</span>
				<span class='text'>fter the war, Carnegie left the railroads to devote all his energies to the ironworks trade</span>
				<span class='text'>Carnegie worked to develop several iron works, eventually forming The Keystone Bridge Works and the Union Ironworks, in Pittsburgh</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he had left the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, he remained closely connected to its management, namely Thomas A</span>
				<span class='text'>Scott and J</span>
				<span class='text'>Edgar Thomson</span>
				<span class='text'>He used his connection to the two men to acquire contracts for his [[Keystone Bridge Company]] and the rails produced by his [[ironworks]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also gave stock to Scott and Thomson in his businesses, and the Pennsylvania was his best customer</span>
				<span class='text'>When he built his first steel plant, he made a point of naming it after Thomson</span>
				<span class='text'>As well as having good business sense, Carnegie possessed charm and literary knowledge</span>
				<span class='text'>He was invited to many important social functions—functions that Carnegie exploited to his own advantage</span>

				<span class='text'>In the following year, Carnegie gave $40,000 for the establishment of a free library in Dunfermline</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1884, he gave $50,000 to [[Bellevue Hospital Medical College]] (now part of [[New York University Medical Center]]) to found a [[histology|histological]] laboratory, now called the [[Carnegie Laboratory]]</span>

				<span class='text'>They toured Scotland by coach, and enjoyed several receptions en route</span>
				<span class='text'>The highlight was a return to Dunfermline, where Carnegie's mother laid the foundation stone of a [[Carnegie library]] which he funded</span>
				<span class='text'>Carnegie's criticism of British society did not mean dislike; on the contrary, one of Carnegie's ambitions was to act as a [[catalyst]] for a close association between English-speaking peoples</span>
				<span class='text'>To this end, in the early 1880s in partnership with [[Samuel Storey]], he purchased numerous newspapers in England, all of which were to advocate the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of &quot;the British Republic&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Carnegie's charm, aided by his wealth, afforded him many British friends, including Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1886, Carnegie's younger brother Thomas died at age 43</span>
				<span class='text'>While owning steel works, Carnegie had purchased at low cost the most valuable of the iron ore fields around [[Lake Superior]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The same year Carnegie became a figure of controversy</span>
				<span class='text'>Following his tour of the UK, he wrote about his experiences in a book entitled ''[[An American Four-in-hand in Britain]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Although actively involved in running his many businesses, Carnegie had become a regular contributor to numerous magazines, most notably ''[[Nineteenth Century (periodical)|The Nineteenth Century]]'', under the editorship of [[James Knowles (architect)|James Knowles]], and the influential ''North American Review'', led by editor [[Lloyd Bryce]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1886, Carnegie wrote his most radical work to date, entitled ''[[Triumphant Democracy]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Liberal in its use of statistics to make its arguments, the book argued his view that the American republican system of government was superior to the British [[monarchy|monarchical]] system</span>
				<span class='text'>It gave a highly favorable and idealized view of American progress and criticized the British royal family</span>
				<span class='text'>The cover depicted an upended royal [[Crown (headgear)|crown]] and a broken scepter</span>
				<span class='text'>The book created considerable controversy in the UK</span>
				<span class='text'>The book made many Americans appreciate their country's economic progress and sold over 40,000 copies, mostly in the US</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1889, Carnegie published &quot;Wealth&quot; in the June issue of the ''North American Review''</span>

				<span class='text'>He strongly opposed the annexation of the Philippines, almost to the point of supporting [[William Jennings Bryan]] against McKinley in 1900</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1898, Carnegie tried to arrange for independence for the Philippines</span>
				<span class='text'>As the end of the [[Spanish American War]] neared, the United States bought the Philippines from Spain for $20 million</span>
				<span class='text'>To counter what he perceived as imperialism on the part of the United States, Carnegie personally offered $20 million to the Philippines so that the [[Filipino people]] could buy their independence from the United States</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;!--ref? In all his ideas, Carnegie intensely believed in the future and influence of the English-speaking people, in their democratic government and alliance for the purpose of peace and the abolition of war, and in the progress of education on non-sectarian lines</span>
				<span class='text'>-&gt;He was a powerful supporter of the movement for [[spelling reform]] as a means of promoting the spread of the English language</span>
				<span class='text'>=== 3000 Public Libraries ====Among his many philanthropic efforts, the establishment of [[public library|public libraries]] throughout the United States, Britain, Canada and other English-speaking countries was especially prominent</span>
				<span class='text'>In this special driving interest and project of his he was inspired by a visit and tour he made with Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Enoch Pratt]] (1808–1896), formerly of Massachusetts but who made his fortune in [[Baltimore]] and ran his various mercantile and financial businesses very thriftily</span>
				<span class='text'>Pratt in turn had been inspired and helped by his friend and fellow Bay Stater, [[George Peabody]], (1795–1869) who also had made his fortune in the &quot;Monumental City&quot; of Baltimore before moving to New York and London to expand his empire as the richest man in America before the Civil War</span>
				<span class='text'>Later he too endowed several institutions, schools, libraries and foundations in his home commonwealth, and also in Baltimore with his [[Peabody Institute]] in 1857, completed in 1866, with added library wings a decade later and several educational foundations throughout the Old South</span>
				<span class='text'>Several decades later, Carnegie's visit with Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Pratt for several days; resting and dining in his city mansion, then touring, visiting and talking with staff and ordinary citizen patrons of the newly established [[Enoch Pratt Free Library]] (1886) impressed the Scotsman deeply and years later he was always heard to proclaim that &quot;Pratt was my guide and inspiration&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The first [[Carnegie library]] opened in 1883 in Dunfermline</span>
				<span class='text'>His method was to build and equip, but only on condition that the local authority matched that by providing the land and a budget for operation and maintenance</span>
				<span class='text'>To secure local interest, in 1885, he gave $500,000 to Pittsburgh for a public library, and in 1886, he gave $250,000 to Allegheny City for a music hall and library; and $250,000 to [[Edinburgh]] for a free library</span>
				<span class='text'>In total Carnegie funded some 3,000 libraries, located in 47 US states, and also in Canada, the United Kingdom, what is now the [[Republic of Ireland]], Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, the [[West Indies]], and [[Fiji]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also donated £50,000 to help set up the [[University of Birmingham]] in 1899</span>

				<span class='text'>Pratt's death, when expansion and city revenues grew tight, Carnegie returned the favor and endowed a large sum to permit the building of many Carnegie Libraries in the Enoch Pratt system in Baltimore and enabled EPFL to expand through the next quarter-century to meet the needs of the growing city and supply neighborhood branches for its annexed suburbs</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left| [[Syracuse University|Carnegie Library at Syracuse University]]]]As Van Slyck (1991) showed, the last years of the 19th century saw acceptance of the idea that free libraries should be available to the American public</span>
				<span class='text'>But the design of the idealized free library was the subject of prolonged and heated debate</span>
				<span class='text'>On one hand, the library profession called for designs that supported efficiency in administration and operation; on the other, wealthy philanthropists favored buildings that reinforced the paternalistic metaphor and enhanced civic pride</span>

				<span class='text'>tm}}&lt;/ref&gt;At the suggestion of his friend Benjamin Ruff, Carnegie's partner [[Henry Clay Frick]] had formed the exclusive South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club high above Johnstown, Pennsylvania</span>
				<span class='text'>The sixty-odd club members were the leading business tycoons of Western Pennsylvania and included among their number Frick's best friend, [[Andrew W</span>
				<span class='text'>Mellon|Andrew Mellon]], his attorneys [[Philander Knox]] and James Hay Reed, as well as Frick's business partner, Carnegie</span>
				<span class='text'>High above the city, near the small town of South Fork, the [[South Fork Dam]] was originally built between 1838 and 1853 by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as part of a canal system to be used as a reservoir for a canal basin in Johnstown</span>
				<span class='text'>With the coming-of-age of railroads superseding canal barge transport, the lake was abandoned by the Commonwealth, sold to the Pennsylvania Railroad, and sold again to private interests and eventually came to be owned by the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club in 1881</span>
				<span class='text'>Prior to the flood, speculators had purchased the abandoned reservoir, made less than well-engineered repairs to the old dam, raised the lake level, built cottages and a clubhouse, and created the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club</span>
				<span class='text'>Less than 20 miles downstream from the dam sat the city of Johnstown</span>
				<span class='text'>he dam was {{convert|72|ft|m}} high and {{convert|931|ft|m}} long</span>
				<span class='text'>Between 1881 when the club was opened, and 1889, the dam frequently sprang leaks and was patched, mostly with mud and straw</span>
				<span class='text'>Additionally, a previous owner removed and sold for scrap the 3 [[cast iron]] discharge pipes that previously allowed a controlled release of water</span>
				<span class='text'>There had been some speculation as to the dam's integrity, and concerns had been raised by the head of the Cambria Iron Works downstream in Johnstown</span>
				<span class='text'>Such repair work, a reduction in height, and unusually high snowmelt and heavy spring rains combined to cause the dam to give way on May 31, 1889 resulting in twenty million tons of water sweeping down the valley causing the Johnstown Flood</span>

				<span class='text'>This strategy was a success, and Knox and Reed were able to fend off all lawsuits that would have placed blame upon the club's members</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough Cambria Iron and Steel's facilities were heavily damaged by the flood, they returned to full production within a year</span>
				<span class='text'>After the flood, Carnegie built Johnstown a new library to replace the one built by Cambria's chief legal counsel Cyrus Elder, which was destroyed in the flood</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|The Homestead Strike]]The [[Homestead Strike]] was a bloody labor confrontation lasting 143 days in 1892, one of the most serious in U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>history</span>
				<span class='text'>The conflict was centered on Carnegie Steel's main plant in [[Homestead, Pennsylvania]], and grew out of a dispute between the National Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers of the United States and the Carnegie Steel Company</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Carnegie, Andrew 1920&quot;&gt;''[[#Autobiography|Autobiography]]'', Ch</span>
				<span class='text'>17&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so, Carnegie left mediation of the dispute in the hands of his associate and partner [[Henry Clay Frick]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Frick was well known in industrial circles for maintaining staunch anti-union sensibilities</span>
				<span class='text'>fter a recent increase in profits by 60%, the company refused to raise workers' pay by more than 30%</span>
				<span class='text'>When some of the workers demanded the full 60%, management locked the union out</span>
				<span class='text'>Workers considered the stoppage a &quot;[[lockout (industry)|lockout]]&quot; by management and not a &quot;strike&quot; by workers</span>
				<span class='text'>As such, the workers would have been well within their rights to protest, and subsequent government action would have been a set of criminal procedures designed to crush what was seen as a pivotal demonstration of the growing [[Labor history of the United States|labor rights movement]], strongly opposed by management</span>
				<span class='text'>Frick brought in thousands of strikebreakers to work the steel mills and [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkerton]] agents to safeguard them</span>
				<span class='text'>n July 6, the arrival of a force of 300 Pinkerton agents from New York City and Chicago resulted in a fight in which 10 men—seven strikers and three Pinkertons—were killed and hundreds were injured</span>
				<span class='text'>Pennsylvania Governor [[Robert E</span>
				<span class='text'>Pattison|Robert Pattison]] ordered two brigades of state militia to the strike site</span>
				<span class='text'>Then, allegedly in response to the fight between the striking workers and the Pinkertons, [[Anarchism|anarchist]] [[Alexander Berkman]] shot at Frick in an attempted assassination, wounding Frick</span>
				<span class='text'>While not directly connected to the strike, Berkman was tied in for the assassination attempt</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''[[#Autobiography|Autobiography]]'', Ch</span>
				<span class='text'>21, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>282–283&lt;/ref&gt; His motto, &quot;All is well since all grows better&quot;, served not only as a good rationalization of his successful business career but also in his view of international relations</span>
				<span class='text'>espite his efforts towards international peace, Carnegie faced many dilemmas on his quest</span>
				<span class='text'>These dilemmas are often regarded as conflicts between his view on international relations and his other loyalties</span>
				<span class='text'>Throughout the 1880s and 1890s, for example, Carnegie allowed his steel works to fill large orders of armor plate for the building of an enlarged and modernized United States Navy; while he opposed American oversea expansion</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Carnegie, ''An American Four-in-Hand in Britain'' (New York, 1883), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>14–15&lt;/ref&gt;On the matter of American colonial expansion, Carnegie had always thought it is an unwise gesture for the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>He did not oppose the annexation of the Hawaiian islands or Puerto Rico, but he opposed the annexation of the Philippines</span>
				<span class='text'>Carnegie believed that it involved a denial of the fundamental democratic principle, and he also urged [[William McKinley]] to withdraw American troops and allow the Filipinos to live with their independence</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Carnegie, ''Americanism Versus Imperialism'', esp</span>
				<span class='text'>pp</span>
				<span class='text'>12–13&lt;/ref&gt; This act strongly impressed the other American anti-imperialists, who soon elected him vice-president of the Anti-Imperialist League</span>
				<span class='text'>fter he sold his steel company in 1901, Carnegie was able to get fully involved in the peace cause, both financially and personally</span>
				<span class='text'>He gave away much of his fortunes to various peace-keeping agencies in order to keep them growing</span>
				<span class='text'>When his friend, the British writer [[William T</span>
				<span class='text'>Stead]], asked him to create a new organization for the goal of a peace and arbitration society, his reply was:{{quote|I do not see that it is wise to devote our efforts to creating another organization</span>
				<span class='text'>Of course I may be wrong in believing that, but I am certainly not wrong that if it were dependent on any millionaire's money it would begin as an object of pity and end as one of derision</span>
				<span class='text'>I wonder that you do not see this</span>
				<span class='text'>There is nothing that robs a righteous cause of its strength more than a millionaire's money</span>
				<span class='text'>Its life is tainted thereby</span>

				<span class='text'>Money is just a push for the act</span>
				<span class='text'>If world peace depended solely on financial support, it would not seem a goal, but more like an act of pity</span>
				<span class='text'>ike Stead, he believed that the United States and the British Empire would merge into one nation, telling him &quot;We are heading straight to the Re-United States&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Carnegie believed that the combined country's power would maintain world peace and disarmament</span>

				<span class='text'>Beyond a gift of $10 million for peace promotion, Carnegie also encouraged the &quot;scientific&quot; investigation of the various causes of war, and the adoption of judicial methods that should eventually eliminate them</span>
				<span class='text'>He believed that the Endowment exists to promote information on the nations' rights and responsibilities under existing international law and to encourage other conferences to codify this law</span>

				<span class='text'>Through the CPU, Carnegie hoped to mobilize the world's churches, religious organizations, and other spiritual and moral resources to join in promoting moral leadership to put an end to war forever</span>
				<span class='text'>For its inaugural international event, the CPU sponsored a conference to be held on August 1, 1914, on the shores of Lake Constance in southern Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>As the delegates made their way to the conference by train, Germany was invading Belgium</span>
				<span class='text'>espite its inauspicious beginning, the CPU thrived</span>
				<span class='text'>Today its focus is on ethics and it is known as the [[Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs]], an independent, nonpartisan, nonprofit organization, whose mission is to be the voice for ethics in international affairs</span>
				<span class='text'>he outbreak of the First World War was clearly a shock to Carnegie and his optimistic view on world peace</span>
				<span class='text'>Although his promotion of [[anti-imperialism]] and world peace had all failed, and the Carnegie Endowment had not fulfilled his expectations, his beliefs and ideas on international relations had helped build the foundation of the [[League of Nations]] after his death, which took world peace to another level</span>
