				<span class='text'>ume's empiricist approach to philosophy places him with [[John Locke]], [[George Berkeley]], [[Francis Bacon]], and [[Thomas Hobbes]] as a [[British Empiricism|British Empiricist]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Atherton|1999|p= ?}} Beginning with his ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' (1739), Hume strove to create a total [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] [[science of man]] that examined the psychological basis of human nature</span>
				<span class='text'>Against [[rationalism|rationalists]], Hume held that passion rather than reason governs human behaviour</span>
				<span class='text'>He argued against the existence of [[innatism|innate ideas]], postulating that humans can have knowledge only of the objects of experience, and the [[Relation of Ideas|relations of ideas]], calling the rest &quot;nothing but sophistry and illusion&quot;,{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=166}} a dichotomy later given the name ''[[Hume's fork]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>He also argued that [[inductive reasoning]], and therefore [[causality]], cannot, ultimately, be justified rationally: our belief in causality and induction instead results from custom, habit, and experience of &quot;[[constant conjunction]]&quot; rather than [[logic]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Contemporary scholars view Hume's moral theory as a unique attempt to synthesize the modern sentimentalist moral tradition to which Hume belonged, with the [[virtue ethics]] tradition of [[ancient philosophy]], with which Hume concurred in regarding traits of character, rather than [[deontological ethics|acts]] or their [[consequentialism|consequences]], as ultimately the proper objects of moral evaluation</span>

				<span class='text'>His tenure there, and the access to research materials it provided, ultimately resulted in Hume's writing the massive six-volume ''[[The History of England (Hume)|The History of England]]'', which became a bestseller and the standard history of England in its day</span>

				<span class='text'>=Biography=====Early life and education===David Hume was the second of two sons born to Joseph Home of [[Chirnside#Ninewells House|Ninewells]], an advocate, and his wife Katherine (''née'' Falconer)</span>
				<span class='text'>He was born on 26 April 1711 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]]) in a tenement on the north side of the [[Lawnmarket]] in Edinburgh</span>
				<span class='text'> Hume's father died when he was a child, just after the author's second birthday, and he was raised by his mother, who never re-married</span>

				<span class='text'>rg}}&lt;/ref&gt; He changed the spelling of his name in 1734, because of the fact that his surname ''Home,'' pronounced ''Hume,'' was not known in England</span>
				<span class='text'>Throughout his life Hume, who never married, spent time occasionally at his family home at Ninewells in [[Berwickshire]], which had belonged to his family since the sixteenth century</span>
				<span class='text'>His finances as a young man were very &quot;slender&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>His family was not rich and, as a younger son, he had little [[wikt:patrimony|patrimony]] to live on</span>
				<span class='text'>He was therefore forced to make a living somehow</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Hume|1778|p=3}}Hume attended the [[University of Edinburgh]] at the unusually early age of twelve (possibly as young as ten) at a time when fourteen was normal</span>
				<span class='text'>At first, because of his family, he considered a career in [[Scots law|law]], but came to have, in his words, &quot;an insurmountable aversion to everything but the pursuits of Philosophy and general Learning; and while [my family] fanceyed I was poring over [[Johannes Voet|Voet]] and [[Arnold Vinnius|Vinnius]], [[Cicero]] and [[Virgil]] were the Authors which I was secretly devouring&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Hume|1778|p=3}} He had little respect for the professors of his time, telling a friend in 1735 that &quot;there is nothing to be learnt from a Professor, which is not to be met with in Books&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>35]}}Aged around 18, he made a philosophical discovery that opened up to him &quot;a new Scene of Thought&quot;, which inspired him &quot;to throw up every other Pleasure or Business to apply entirely to it&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Hume|1993|p=346}} He did not recount what this scene was, and commentators have offered a variety of speculations</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Johnson|1995|pp=8–9}} One popular interpretation, prominent in contemporary Hume scholarship, is that the new &quot;scene of thought&quot; was Hume's realization that Francis Hutcheson's &quot;moral sense&quot; theory of morality could be applied to the understanding as well</span>
				<span class='text'>Due to this inspiration, Hume set out to spend a minimum of ten years reading and writing</span>
				<span class='text'>He soon came to the verge of a [[mental breakdown]], suffering from what a doctor diagnosed as the &quot;Disease of the Learned&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Hume wrote that it started with a coldness, which he attributed to a &quot;Laziness of Temper&quot;, that lasted about nine months</span>
				<span class='text'>Later, some [[scurvy]] spots broke out on his fingers</span>
				<span class='text'>This was what persuaded Hume's physician to make his diagnosis</span>
				<span class='text'>Hume wrote that he &quot;went under a Course of Bitters and Anti-Hysteric Pills&quot;, taken along with a pint of claret every day</span>
				<span class='text'>Hume also decided to have a more active life to better continue his learning</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Mossner|1950|p=193}} His health improved somewhat, but, in 1731, he was afflicted with a ravenous appetite and palpitations of the heart</span>
				<span class='text'>After eating well for a time, he went from being &quot;tall, lean and raw-bon'd&quot; to being &quot;sturdy, robust [and] healthful-like&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Hume|2011|pp=13–15}} Indeed, Hume would become well known in his time for his &quot;corpulence&quot;, and his fondness for good port and cheese</span>
				<span class='text'>==Career===At 25 years of age, Hume, although of noble ancestry, had no source of income and no learned profession</span>
				<span class='text'>As was common at his time, he became a merchant's assistant, but he had to leave his native Scotland</span>
				<span class='text'>He travelled via [[Bristol]] to [[La Flèche]] in Anjou, France</span>

				<span class='text'>Although many scholars today consider the ''Treatise'' to be Hume's most important work and one of the most important books in Western philosophy, the critics in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] at the time did not agree, describing it as &quot;abstract and unintelligible&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Mossner|1950|p=195}} As Hume had spent most of his savings during those four years,{{sfn|Mossner|1950|p=193}} he resolved &quot;to make a very rigid frugality supply my deficiency of fortune, to maintain unimpaired my independency, and to regard every object as contemptible except the improvements of my talents in literature&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Hume|1993|p=352}} Despite the disappointment, Hume later wrote, &quot;Being naturally of a cheerful and [[Humorism|sanguine]] temper, I soon recovered from the blow and prosecuted with great ardour my studies in the country</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Hume|1993|p=352}} There, in an attempt to make his larger work better known and more intelligible, he published the ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature (Abstract)|An Abstract of a Book lately Published]]'' as a summary of the main doctrines of the ''Treatise'', without revealing its authorship</span>

				<span class='text'>quot; One such disappointment Hume discusses in the mini-autobiography was his disappointment that  with the initial literary reception of the ''Treatise'', which he claims to have overcome by means of the success of the ''Essays'': &quot;the work was favourably received, and soon made me entirely forget my former disappointment&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Perhaps most notable is Hume's revelation of his own retrospective judgment that his philosophical debut's apparent failure &quot;had proceeded more from the manner than the matter</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Hume thus suggests that  &quot;I had been guilty of a very usual indiscretion, in going to the press too early</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Hume provides an unambiguous self-assessment of the relative value of his works: &quot;my Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals; which, in my own opinion (who ought not to judge on that subject) is of all my writings, historical, philosophical, or literary, incomparably the best</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;  Hume also makes a number of self-assessments in the essay, writing of his social relations that &quot;My company was not unacceptable to the young and careless, as well as to the studious and literary&quot;, noting of his complex relation to religion, as well as the state, that &quot;though I wantonly exposed myself to the rage of both civil and religious factions, they seemed to be disarmed in my behalf of their wonted fury&quot;, and professing of his character that &quot;My friends never had occasion to vindicate any one circumstance of my character and conduct</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Hume concludes the essay with the frank admission: &quot; I cannot say there is no vanity in making this funeral oration of myself, but I hope it is not a misplaced one; and this is a matter of fact which is easily cleared and ascertained</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Hume|1789|p=xxi}}==Writings==In the introduction to ''A Treatise of Human Nature'', Hume wrote, &quot;'Tis evident, that all the sciences have a relation, more or less, to human nature&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Even Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, and Natural Religion, are in some measure dependent on the science of Man</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He also wrote that the [[science of man]] is the &quot;only solid foundation for the other sciences&quot; and that the method for this science requires both experience and observation as the foundations of a logical argument</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Hume|1739|p=7}} On this aspect of Hume's thought, philosophical historian [[Frederick Copleston]] wrote that it was Hume's aim to apply to the science of man the method of experimental philosophy (the term that was current at the time to imply [[Natural philosophy]]), and that &quot;Hume's plan is to extend to philosophy in general the methodological limitations of [[classical mechanics|Newtonian physics]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Copleston|1999|pp=405–406}}Until recently, Hume was seen as a forerunner of [[logical positivism]]; a form of anti-[[metaphysics|metaphysical]] empiricism</span>

				<span class='text'>Hume, on this view, was a proto-positivist, who, in his philosophical writings, attempted to demonstrate how ordinary propositions about objects, causal relations, the self, and so on, are [[logical equivalence|semantically equivalent]] to propositions about one's experiences</span>

				<span class='text'>Hume thought that we can form beliefs about that which extends beyond any possible experience, through the operation of faculties such as custom and the imagination, but he was sceptical about claims to knowledge on this basis</span>
				<span class='text'>==Impressions and Ideas===One of the most central doctrines of Hume's philosophy, stated in the very first lines of the ''Treatise'', is his notion that the mind consists of its mental perceptions, or the mental objects which are present to it, and which divide into two categories: ''impressions,'' and ''ideas''</span>
				<span class='text'>Hume's Treatise thus opens with the words: 'All the perceptions of the human mind resolve themselves into two distinct kinds, which I shall call IMPRESSIONS and IDEAS</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;  Hume states that &quot;I believe it will not be very necessary to employ many words in explaining this distinction&quot; and commentators have generally taken Hume to mean the distinction between [[feeling]] and [[thinking]]</span>

				<span class='text'>This may be the area of Hume's thought where his scepticism about human powers of reason is most pronounced</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn| Kenyon|Craig|1985|p= ?}} The problem revolves around the plausibility of [[inductive reasoning]], that is, reasoning from the observed behaviour of objects to their behaviour when unobserved</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Hume|1777|p= 26}} Hume argues that we tend to believe that things behave in a regular manner, meaning that patterns in the behaviour of objects seem to persist into the future, and throughout the unobserved present</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Millican|1996|p= ?}}|group=note}}—and both of these are inadequate</span>
				<span class='text'>With regard to demonstrative reasoning, Hume argues that the uniformity principle cannot be demonstrated, as it is &quot;consistent and conceivable&quot; that nature might stop being regular</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Hume|1777|p= 111}} Turning to probable reasoning, Hume argues that we cannot hold that nature will continue to be uniform because it has been in the past</span>
				<span class='text'>As this is using the very sort of reasoning (induction) that is under question, it would be [[circular reasoning]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Hume|1777|p= 115}} Thus, no form of justification will rationally warrant our inductive inferences</span>
				<span class='text'>ume's solution to this problem is to argue that, rather than reason, natural instinct explains the human practice of making inductive inferences</span>
				<span class='text'>He asserts that &quot;Nature, by an absolute and uncontroulable {{sic}} necessity has determin'd us to judge as well as to breathe and feel</span>

				<span class='text'>There are at least three interpretations of Hume's theory of causation represented in the literature: (1) the logical positivist; (2) the sceptical realist; and (3) the quasi-realist</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Read|Richman|2002|pp=13–14 and 69}}The [[logical positivism|logical positivist]] interpretation is that Hume analyses causal propositions, such as &quot;A caused B&quot;, in terms of regularities in perception: &quot;A causes B&quot; is equivalent to &quot;Whenever A-type events happen, B-type ones follow&quot;, where &quot;whenever&quot; refers to all possible perceptions</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Ayer|1946|pp=135–136}} A modern-day version of the bundle theory of the mind has been advanced by [[Derek Parfit]] in his ''[[Reasons and Persons]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>They argue that distinct selves can have perceptions that stand in relations of similarity and causality with one another</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, perceptions must already come parcelled into distinct &quot;bundles&quot; before they can be associated according to the relations of similarity and causality</span>
				<span class='text'>In other words, the mind must already possess a unity that cannot be generated, or constituted, by these relations alone</span>

				<span class='text'>Buridan was said to believe that the donkey would die, because he has no [[autonomy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The donkey is incapable of forming a rational decision as there is no motive to choose one bale of hay over the other</span>
				<span class='text'>However, human beings are different, because a human who is placed in a position where he is forced to choose one loaf of bread over another will make a decision to take one in lieu of the other</span>
				<span class='text'>For Buridan, humans have the capacity of autonomy, and he recognises the choice that is ultimately made will be based on chance, as both loaves of bread are exactly the same</span>

				<span class='text'>Furthermore, people by nature enjoy relating miracles they have heard without caring for their veracity and thus miracles are easily transmitted even where false</span>
				<span class='text'>Also, Hume notes that miracles seem to occur mostly in &quot;ignorant and barbarous nations&quot;{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=119}} and times, and the reason they do not occur in the civilised societies is such societies are not awed by what they know to be natural events</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally, the miracles of each religion argue against all other religions and their miracles, and so even if a proportion of all reported miracles across the world fit Hume's requirement for belief, the miracles of each religion make the other less likely</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bailey|O'Brien|2006|pp=105–108}}Hume was extremely pleased with his argument against miracles in his ''Enquiry''</span>
				<span class='text'>He states &quot;I flatter myself, that I have discovered an argument of a like nature, which, if just, will, with the wise and learned, be an everlasting check to all kinds of superstitious delusion, and consequently, will be useful as long as the world endures</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=110}} Thus, Hume's argument against miracles had a more abstract basis founded upon the scrutiny, not just primarily of miracles, but of all forms of belief systems</span>
				<span class='text'>It is a common sense notion of veracity based upon epistemological evidence, and founded on a principle of rationality, proportionality and reasonability</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bailey|O'Brien|2006|pp=105–108}}The criterion for assessing a belief system for Hume is based on the balance of probability whether something is more likely than not to have occurred</span>
				<span class='text'>Since the weight of empirical experience contradicts the notion for the existence of miracles, such accounts should be treated with scepticism</span>
				<span class='text'>Further, the myriad of accounts of miracles contradict one another, as some people who receive miracles will aim to prove the authority of Jesus, whereas others will aim to prove the authority of Muhammad or some other religious prophet or deity</span>
				<span class='text'>These various differing accounts weaken the overall evidential power of miracles</span>

				<span class='text'>rg/campbell-george/]&lt;/ref&gt;Hume's main argument concerning miracles is that miracles by definition are singular events that differ from the established laws of nature</span>
				<span class='text'>Such natural laws are codified as a result of past experiences</span>
				<span class='text'>Therefore, a miracle is a violation of all prior experience and thus incapable on this basis of reasonable belief</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the probability that something has occurred in contradiction of all past experience should always be judged to be less than the probability that either ones senses have deceived one, or the person recounting the miraculous occurrence is lying or mistaken</span>
				<span class='text'>Hume would say, all of which he had past experience of</span>
				<span class='text'>For Hume, this refusal to grant credence does not guarantee correctness</span>
				<span class='text'>He offers the example of an Indian Prince, who, having grown up in a hot country, refuses to believe that water has frozen</span>
				<span class='text'>By Hume's lights, this refusal is not wrong and the Prince &quot;reasoned justly&quot;; it is presumably only when he has had extensive experience of the freezing of water that he has warrant to believe that the event could occur</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Hume|1777|p=113}}So for Hume, either the miraculous event will become a recurrent event or else it will never be rational to believe it occurred</span>
				<span class='text'>The connection to religious belief is left unexplained throughout, except for the close of his discussion where Hume notes the reliance of Christianity upon testimony of miraculous occurrences</span>
				<span class='text'>He makes an ironic remark that anyone who &quot;is moved by faith to assent&quot; to revealed testimony &quot;is conscious of a continued miracle in his own person, which subverts all principles of his understanding, and gives him a determination to believe what is most contrary to custom and experience</span>

				<span class='text'>Inspired by [[Voltaire]]'s sense of the breadth of history, Hume widened the focus of the field away from merely kings, parliaments, and armies, to literature and science as well</span>
