				<span class='text'>As a school teacher, Ohm began his research with the new [[electrochemical cell]], invented by Italian scientist [[Alessandro Volta]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Using equipment of his own creation, Ohm found that there is a direct proportionality between the potential difference ([[voltage]]) applied across a conductor and the resultant [[electric current]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This relationship is known as [[Ohm's law]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Biography=====Early years===Georg Simon Ohm was born into a [[Protestant]] family in [[Erlangen]], [[Brandenburg-Bayreuth]] (then a part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]), son to Johann Wolfgang Ohm, a locksmith and Maria Elizabeth Beck, the daughter of a tailor in Erlangen</span>
				<span class='text'>Although his parents had not been formally educated, Ohm's father was a respected man who had educated himself to a high level and was able to give his sons an excellent education through his own teachings</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Keithley, Joseph F</span>
				<span class='text'>(1999)</span>
				<span class='text'>''The Story of Electrical and Magnetic Measurements: From 500 BC to the 1940s''</span>
				<span class='text'>John Wiley &amp; Sons&lt;/ref&gt; Of the seven children of the family only three survived to adulthood: Georg Simon, his younger brother [[Martin Ohm|Martin]], who later became a well-known mathematician, and his sister Elizabeth Barbara</span>
				<span class='text'>His mother died when he was ten</span>
				<span class='text'>rom early childhood, Georg and Martin were taught by their father who brought them to a high standard in [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]] and [[philosophy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Georg Simon attended Erlangen Gymnasium from age eleven to fifteen where he received little in the area of scientific training, which sharply contrasted with the inspired instruction that both Georg and Martin received from their father</span>
				<span class='text'>This characteristic made the Ohms bear a resemblance to the [[Bernoulli family]], as noted by [[Karl Christian von Langsdorf]], a professor at the [[Friedrich-Alexander-University, Erlangen-Nuremberg|University of Erlangen]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==Life in university===Georg Ohm's father, concerned that his son was wasting his educational opportunity, sent Ohm to Switzerland</span>
				<span class='text'>There in September 1806 Ohm accepted a position as a mathematics teacher in a school in Gottstadt bei Nidau</span>
				<span class='text'>[Karl Christian von Langsdorf]] left the University of Erlangen in early 1809 to take up a post in the [[Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg|University of Heidelberg]] and Ohm would have liked to have gone with him to [[Heidelberg]] to restart his mathematical studies</span>
				<span class='text'>Langsdorf, however, advised Ohm to continue with his studies of mathematics on his own, advising Ohm to read the works of [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]], [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace]] and [[Sylvestre François Lacroix|Lacroix]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Rather reluctantly Ohm took his advice but he left his teaching post in [[Gottstatt Monastery]] in March 1809 to become a private tutor in [[Neuchâtel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>For two years he carried out his duties as a tutor while he followed Langsdorf's advice and continued his private study of mathematics</span>
				<span class='text'>Then in April 1811 he returned to the University of Erlangen</span>
				<span class='text'>==Teaching career===Ohm's own studies prepared him for his [[doctorate]] which he received from the University of Erlangen on October 25, 1811</span>
				<span class='text'> He immediately joined the faculty there as a lecturer in mathematics but left after three semesters because of unpromising prospects</span>
				<span class='text'>He could not survive on his salary as a lecturer</span>
				<span class='text'>The  [[Bavaria|Bavarian government]] offered him a post as a teacher of mathematics and physics at a poor quality school in [[Bamberg]] which Ohm accepted in January 1813</span>
				<span class='text'>Unhappy with his job, Georg began writing an elementary textbook on [[geometry]] as a way to prove his abilities</span>
				<span class='text'>Ohm's school was closed down in February 1816</span>
				<span class='text'>The Bavarian government then sent him to an overcrowded school in Bamberg to help out with the teaching of mathematics</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Denkmal Ohm TU München</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Memorial for Ohm (by [[Wilhelm von Rümann]]) at the [[Technical University of Munich]], Campus Theresienstrasse]]After his assignment in Bamberg, Ohm sent his completed manuscript to [[Frederick William III of Prussia|King Wilhelm III of Prussia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The King was satisfied with Ohm's book, and offered Ohm a position at the [[Dreikönigsgymnasium|Jesuit Gymnasium]] of [[Cologne]] on 11 September 1817</span>
				<span class='text'>This school had a reputation for good science education and Ohm was required to teach [[physics]] in addition to mathematics</span>
				<span class='text'>The physics laboratory was well equipped, allowing Ohm to begin experiments in physics</span>
				<span class='text'>As the son of a locksmith, Ohm had some practical experience with mechanical devices</span>
				<span class='text'>hm published ''Die galvanische Kette, mathematisch bearbeitet'' (''The Galvanic Circuit Investigated Mathematically'') in 1827</span>
				<span class='text'>Ohm's college did not appreciate his work and Ohm resigned from his position</span>
				<span class='text'>He then made an application to, and was employed by, the Polytechnic School of [[Nuremberg]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Ohm arrived at the Polytechnic School of Nuremberg in 1833, and in 1852 he became a professor of experimental physics at the [[University of Munich]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=34}}In 1849, Ohm published ''Beiträge zur Molecular-Physik'', (in English: Molecular Physics)</span>
				<span class='text'>In the preface of this work he stated he hoped to write a second and third volume &quot;and if God gives me length of days for it, a fourth&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>However, on finding that an original discovery recorded in it was being anticipated by a Swedish scientist he did not publish it, stating: &quot;The episode has given a fresh and deep sense for my mind to the saying 'Man proposes, and God disposes'</span>
				<span class='text'>The project that gave the first impetus to my inquiry has been dissipated into mist, and a new one, undesigned by me, has been accomplished in its place</span>

				<span class='text'>17–18&lt;/ref&gt;He died in Munich in 1854,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=34}} and is buried in the [[Alter Südfriedhof]]</span>
				<span class='text'>A collection of his family letters would be compiled in a German book, which shows that he used to sign some of his letters with the expression ''&quot;Gott befohlen, G S Ohm,&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;Georg Simon Ohm (2002), ''Georg Simon Ohm: nachgelassene Schriften und Dokumente aus seinem Leben : mit Schriftstücken seiner Vorfahren und Briefen seines Bruders Martin''</span>

				<span class='text'>Thus the law came to bear the name of Ohm</span>
				<span class='text'>} in the famous book '''Die galvanische Kette, mathematisch bearbeitet''' (tr</span>
				<span class='text'> '''The Galvanic Circuit Investigated Mathematically''') (1827) in which he gave his complete theory of electricity</span>
				<span class='text'>{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=34}}In this work, he stated his law for [[electromotive force]] acting between the extremities of any part of a [[electrical circuit|circuit]] is the product of the strength of the [[electric current|current]], and the [[electrical resistance|resistance]] of that part of the circuit</span>

				<span class='text'>While his work greatly influenced the theory and applications of current electricity, it was coldly received at that time</span>
				<span class='text'>It is interesting that Ohm presents his theory as one of contiguous action, a theory which opposed the concept of action at a distance</span>
				<span class='text'>Ohm believed that the communication of electricity occurred between &quot;contiguous particles&quot; which is the term he himself used</span>
				<span class='text'>The paper is concerned with this idea, and in particular with illustrating the differences in this scientific approach of Ohm's and the approaches of [[Joseph Fourier]] and [[Claude-Louis Navier]]</span>

				<span class='text'>The most important was his pamphlet published in [[Berlin]] in 1827, with the title ''Die galvanische Kette mathematisch bearbeitet''</span>
				<span class='text'>This work, the germ of which had appeared during the two preceding years in the journals of Schweigger and Poggendorff, has exerted an important influence on the development of the theory and applications of [[electric current]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Ohm's name has been incorporated in the terminology of [[Electrical engineering|electrical science]] in Ohm's Law (which he first published in ''Die galvanische Kette''</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>, the [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportionality]] of current and [[voltage]] in a [[resistor]], and adopted as the [[SI]] unit of [[electrical resistance|resistance]], the [[ohm (unit)|ohm]] (symbol Ω)</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough Ohm's work strongly influenced theory, at first it was received with little enthusiasm</span>
				<span class='text'>However, his work was eventually recognized by the [[Royal Society]] with its award of the [[Copley Medal]] in 1841</span>
