				<span class='text'>Baudelaire also absorbed much of Delacroixs aesthetic ideas as expressed in his journals</span>
				<span class='text'>As Baudelaire elaborated in his Salon of 1846 As one contemplates his series of pictures one seems to be attending the celebration of some grievous mystery</span>

				<span class='text'>In private correspondence Delacroix stated that Baudelaire really gets on my nerves and he expressed his unhappiness with Baudelaires persistent comments about melancholy and feverishness</span>
				<span class='text'>Baudelaire had no formal musical training and knew little of composers beyond  and </span>
				<span class='text'>Weber was in some ways s precursor using the  and conceiving the idea of the total art work Gesamtkunstwerk both of which gained Baudelaires admiration</span>
				<span class='text'>Before even hearing Wagners music Baudelaire studied reviews and essays about him and formulated his impressions</span>

				<span class='text'> Gautiers frequent meditations on death and the horror of life are themes which influenced Baudelaire writings</span>
				<span class='text'>In gratitude for their friendship and commonality of vision Baudelaire dedicated Les Fleurs du mal to Gautier</span>
