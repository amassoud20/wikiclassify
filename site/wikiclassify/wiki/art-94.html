				<span class='text'>is most famous work, ''[[Les Fleurs du mal]]'' (''The Flowers of Evil''), expresses the changing nature of beauty in modern, industrializing Paris during the 19th century</span>
				<span class='text'>Baudelaire's highly original style of prose-poetry influenced a whole generation of poets including [[Paul Verlaine]], [[Arthur Rimbaud]] and [[Stéphane Mallarmé]] among many others</span>
				<span class='text'>He is credited with coining the term &quot;[[modernity]]&quot; (''modernité'') to designate the fleeting, ephemeral experience of life in an urban metropolis, and the responsibility art has to capture that experience</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Baudelaire the poet=={{quote|Who among us has not dreamt, in moments of ambition, of the miracle of a poetic prose, musical without rhythm and rhyme, supple and staccato enough to adapt to the lyrical stirrings of the soul, the undulations of dreams, and sudden leaps of consciousness</span>
				<span class='text'>This obsessive idea is above all a child of giant cities, of the intersecting of their myriad relations</span>
				<span class='text'>Dedication of ''[[Le Spleen de Paris]]}}Baudelaire is one of the major innovators in [[French literature]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His poetry is influenced by the French romantic poets of the earlier 19th century, although its attention to the formal features of verse connects it more closely to the work of the contemporary &quot;Parnassians&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>As for theme and tone, in his works we see the rejection of the belief in the supremacy of nature and the fundamental goodness of man as typically espoused by the romantics and expressed by them in rhetorical, effusive and public voice in favor of a new urban sensibility, an awareness of individual moral complexity, an interest in vice (linked with [[Decadent movement|decadence]]) and refined sensual and aesthetic pleasures, and the use of urban subject matter, such as the city, the crowd, individual passers-by, all expressed in highly ordered verse, sometimes through a cynical and ironic voice</span>
				<span class='text'>Formally, the use of sound to create atmosphere, and of &quot;symbols&quot;, (images that take on an expanded function within the poem), betray a move towards considering the poem as a self-referential object, an idea further developed by the Symbolists [[Paul Verlaine|Verlaine]] and [[Stéphane Mallarmé|Mallarmé]], who acknowledge Baudelaire as a pioneer in this regard</span>
				<span class='text'>eyond his innovations in versification and the theories of symbolism and &quot;correspondences&quot;, an awareness of which is essential to any appreciation of the literary value of his work, aspects of his work that regularly receive (or have received) much critical discussion include the role of women, the theological direction of his work and his alleged advocacy of &quot;satanism&quot;, his experience of drug-induced states of mind, the figure of the dandy, his stance regarding democracy and its implications for the individual, his response to the spiritual uncertainties of the time, his criticisms of the bourgeois, and his advocacy of modern music and painting (e</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; His father, François Baudelaire, a senior civil servant and amateur artist, was 34 years older than Baudelaire's mother</span>
				<span class='text'>François died during Baudelaire's childhood, in 1827</span>
				<span class='text'>The following year, Caroline married Lieutenant Colonel Jacques Aupick, who later became a French ambassador to various noble courts</span>
				<span class='text'>Biographers have often seen this as a crucial moment, considering that finding himself no longer the sole focus of his mother's affection left him with a trauma, which goes some way to explaining the excesses later apparent in his life</span>
				<span class='text'>He stated in a letter to her that, &quot;There was in my childhood a period of passionate love for you</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1994, p</span>
				<span class='text'>16&lt;/ref&gt; Baudelaire regularly begged his mother for money throughout his career, often promising that a lucrative publishing contract or journalistic commission was just around the corner</span>
				<span class='text'>audelaire was educated in [[Lyon]], where he boarded</span>
				<span class='text'>Baudelaire at fourteen was described by a classmate: &quot;He was much more refined and distinguished than any of our fellow pupils [</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> we are bound to one another [</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> by shared tastes and sympathies, the precocious love of fine works of literature</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1994, p</span>
				<span class='text'>35&lt;/ref&gt; Baudelaire was erratic in his studies, at times diligent, at other times prone to &quot;idleness&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Later, he attended the [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand]] in Paris, studying law, a popular course for those not yet decided on any particular career</span>
				<span class='text'>Baudelaire began to frequent prostitutes and may have contracted [[gonorrhea]] and [[syphilis]] during this period</span>
				<span class='text'>Baudelaire began to run up debts, mostly for clothes</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon gaining his [[Academic degree|degree]] in 1839, he told his brother &quot;I don't feel I have a vocation for anything</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; His stepfather had in mind a career in law or diplomacy, but instead Baudelaire decided to embark upon a literary career</span>
				<span class='text'>His mother later recalled: &quot;Oh, what grief! If Charles had let himself be guided by his stepfather, his career would have been very different</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> He would not have left a name in literature, it is true, but we should have been happier, all three of us</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Baudelaire, painted in 1844 by Emile Deroy (1820–1846)]]His stepfather sent him on a voyage to [[Calcutta, India]], in 1841 in the hope of ending his dissolute habits</span>
				<span class='text'>The trip provided strong impressions of the sea, sailing, and exotic ports, that he later employed in his poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1994, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>67–68&lt;/ref&gt; (Baudelaire later exaggerated his aborted trip to create a legend about his youthful travels and experiences, including &quot;riding on elephants&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'> Baudelaire returned to the taverns where he began to compose some of the poems of &quot;Les Fleurs du Mal&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>At 21, he received a good-sized inheritance but squandered much of it within a few years</span>
				<span class='text'>His family obtained a decree to place his property in trust,&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1994, p</span>
				<span class='text'>71&lt;/ref&gt; which he resented bitterly, at one point arguing that allowing him to fail alone financially would have been the one sure way of teaching him the value of maintaining well-ordered finances</span>
				<span class='text'>audelaire became known in artistic circles as a [[dandy]] and free-spender</span>
				<span class='text'>During this time, [[Jeanne Duval]] became his mistress</span>
				<span class='text'>His mother thought Duval a &quot;Black Venus&quot; who &quot;tortured him in every way&quot; and drained him of money at every opportunity</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1994, p</span>
				<span class='text'>75&lt;/ref&gt; She was rejected by his family</span>
				<span class='text'>He made a suicide attempt during this time</span>
				<span class='text'>audelaire took part in the [[Revolutions of 1848 in France|Revolutions of 1848]] and wrote for a revolutionary newspaper</span>
				<span class='text'>However, his interest was passing, as he was later to note in his political writings in his journals</span>
				<span class='text'>n the early 1850s, Baudelaire struggled with poor health, pressing debts, and irregular literary output</span>
				<span class='text'>He often moved from one lodging to another to escape creditors</span>
				<span class='text'>He received many projects that he was unable to complete, though he did finish translations of stories by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]</span>
				<span class='text'>pon the death of his stepfather in 1857, Baudelaire received no mention in the will but he was heartened nonetheless that the division with his mother might now be mended</span>
				<span class='text'>At 36 he wrote her: &quot;believe that I belong to you absolutely, and that I belong only to you&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1994, p</span>
				<span class='text'>219</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Published career===His first published work was his art review &quot;Salon of 1845&quot;, which attracted immediate attention for its boldness</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of his critical opinions were novel in their time, including his championing of [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]], and some of his views seem remarkably in tune with the future theories of the Impressionist painters</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1846, Baudelaire wrote his second Salon review, gaining additional credibility as an advocate and critic of [[Romanticism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His support of [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]] as the foremost Romantic artist gained widespread notice</span>

				<span class='text'>The effect on fellow artists was, as [[Théodore de Banville]] stated, &quot;immense, prodigious, unexpected, mingled with admiration and with some indefinable anxious fear&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1994, p</span>
				<span class='text'>236</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; [[Gustave Flaubert]], recently attacked in a similar fashion for ''[[Madame Bovary]]'' (and acquitted), was impressed and wrote to Baudelaire: &quot;You have found a way to rejuvenate Romanticism</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> You are as unyielding as marble, and as penetrating as an English mist</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1994, p</span>
				<span class='text'>241</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The principal themes of [[Human sexuality|sex]] and death were considered scandalous</span>
				<span class='text'>He also touched on lesbianism, sacred and profane love, metamorphosis, melancholy, the corruption of the city, lost innocence, the oppressiveness of living, and wine</span>
				<span class='text'>Notable in some poems is Baudelaire's use of imagery of the sense of smell and of fragrances, which is used to evoke feelings of [[nostalgia]] and past intimacy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1994, p</span>
				<span class='text'>231</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The book, however, quickly became a byword for unwholesomeness among mainstream critics of the day</span>
				<span class='text'>Some critics called a few of the poems &quot;masterpieces of passion, art and poetry&quot; but other poems were deemed to merit no less than legal action to suppress them</span>

				<span class='text'>232–237&lt;/ref&gt; J</span>
				<span class='text'>Habas writing in ''[[Le Figaro]]'', led the charge against Baudelaire, writing: &quot;Everything in it which is not hideous is incomprehensible, everything one understands is putrid</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Then Baudelaire responded to the outcry, in a prophetic letter to his mother:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;You know that I have always considered that literature and the arts pursue an aim independent of morality</span>
				<span class='text'>Beauty of conception and style is enough for me</span>
				<span class='text'>But this book, whose title (''Fleurs du mal'') says everything, is clad, as you will see, in a cold and sinister beauty</span>
				<span class='text'>It was created with rage and patience</span>
				<span class='text'>Besides, the proof of its positive worth is in all the ill that they speak of it</span>
				<span class='text'>The book enrages people</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, since I was terrified myself of the horror that I should inspire, I cut out a third from the proofs</span>

				<span class='text'>Another edition of ''Les Fleurs du mal'', without these poems, but with considerable additions, appeared in 1861</span>

				<span class='text'>Weber was in some ways [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s precursor, using the [[leitmotif]] and conceiving the idea of the &quot;total art work&quot; (&quot;Gesamtkunstwerk&quot;), both of which gained Baudelaire's admiration</span>
				<span class='text'>Before even hearing Wagner's music, Baudelaire studied reviews and essays about him, and formulated his impressions</span>
				<span class='text'>Later, Baudelaire put them into his non-technical analysis of Wagner, which was highly regarded, particularly his essay &quot;Richard Wagner et Tannhäuser à Paris&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;yhkyza&quot;/&gt; After attending three Wagner concerts in Paris in 1860, Baudelaire wrote to the composer: &quot;I had a feeling of pride and joy in understanding, in being possessed, in being overwhelmed, a truly sensual pleasure like that of rising in the air</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hyslop (1980), p</span>
				<span class='text'>69&lt;/ref&gt; Baudelaire's writings contributed to the elevation of Wagner and to the cult of [[Wagnerism]] that swept Europe in the following decades</span>
				<span class='text'>==Théophile Gautier===[[Théophile Gautier|Gautier]], writer and poet, earned Baudelaire's respect for his perfection of form and his mastery of language, though Baudelaire thought he lacked deeper emotion and spirituality</span>
				<span class='text'>Both strove to express the artist's inner vision, which [[Heinrich Heine]] had earlier stated: &quot;In artistic matters, I am a supernaturalist</span>
				<span class='text'>I believe that the artist can not find all his forms in nature, but that the most remarkable are revealed to him in his soul</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hyslop (1980), p</span>
				<span class='text'>131</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Gautier's frequent meditations on death and the horror of life are themes which influenced Baudelaire writings</span>
				<span class='text'>In gratitude for their friendship and commonality of vision, Baudelaire dedicated ''Les Fleurs du mal'' to Gautier</span>
				<span class='text'>==Édouard Manet===[[Édouard Manet|Manet]] and Baudelaire became constant companions from around 1855</span>
				<span class='text'>In the early 1860s, Baudelaire accompanied Manet on daily sketching trips and often met him socially</span>
				<span class='text'>Manet also lent Baudelaire money and looked after his affairs, particularly when Baudelaire went to Belgium</span>
				<span class='text'>Baudelaire encouraged Manet to strike out on his own path and not succumb to criticism</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Manet has great talent, a talent which will stand the test of time</span>
				<span class='text'>But he has a weak character</span>

				<span class='text'>Baudelaire praised the modernity of Manet's subject matter: &quot;almost all our originality comes from the stamp that 'time' imprints upon our feelings</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hyslop (1980), p</span>
				<span class='text'>53</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; When Manet's famous ''[[Olympia (painting)|Olympia]]'' (1863), a portrait of a nude prostitute, provoked a scandal for its blatant realism mixed with an imitation of [[Sleeping Venus (Giorgione)|Renaissance motifs]], Baudelaire worked privately to support his friend, though he offered no public defense (he was, however, ill at the time)</span>
				<span class='text'>When Baudelaire returned from Belgium after his stroke, Manet and his wife were frequent visitors at the nursing home and she would play passages from Wagner for Baudelaire on the piano</span>

				<span class='text'>51</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Nadar===[[Nadar (photographer)|Nadar]] (Félix Tournachon) was a noted caricaturist, scientist and important early photographer</span>
				<span class='text'>Baudelaire admired Nadar, one of his closest friends, and wrote: &quot;Nadar is the most amazing manifestation of vitality</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hyslop (1980), p</span>
				<span class='text'>65</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; They moved in similar circles and Baudelaire made many social connections through him</span>
				<span class='text'>Nadar's ex-mistress [[Jeanne Duval]] became Baudelaire's mistress around 1842</span>
				<span class='text'>Baudelaire became interested in photography in the 1850s and, denouncing it as an art form, advocated its return to &quot;its real purpose, which is that of being the servant to the sciences and arts&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Photography should not, according to Baudelaire, encroach upon &quot;the domain of the impalpable and the imaginary&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>63</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Nadar remained a stalwart friend right to Baudelaire's last days and wrote his obituary notice in ''[[Le Figaro]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>=Philosophy==Many of Baudelaire's philosophical proclamations were considered scandalous and intentionally provocative in his time</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote on a wide range of subjects, drawing criticism and outrage from many quarters</span>
