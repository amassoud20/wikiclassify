				<span class='text'>Upon his return to India, he enrolled at the [[Allahabad High Court]], and took an interest in national politics, which eventually replaced his legal practice</span>
				<span class='text'>A committed nationalist since his teenage years, he became a rising figure in Indian politics during the upheavals of the 1910s</span>
				<span class='text'>He became the prominent leader of the left-wing factions of the [[Indian National Congress]] during the 1920s, and eventually of the entire Congress, with the tacit approval of his mentor, Gandhi</span>
				<span class='text'>As [[Congress President]] in 1929, Nehru called for [[Purna Swaraj|complete independence]] from the [[British Raj]] and instigated the Congress's decisive shift towards the left</span>
				<span class='text'>ehru and the Congress dominated Indian politics during the 1930s as the country moved towards independence</span>
				<span class='text'>His idea of a secular nation-state was seemingly validated when the Congress, under his leadership, swept the [[Indian provincial elections, 1937|1937 provincial elections]] and formed the government in several provinces; on the other hand, the separatist [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] fared much poorer</span>
				<span class='text'>But these achievements were seriously compromised in the aftermath of the [[Quit India Movement]] in 1942, which saw the British effectively crush the Congress as a political organisation</span>
				<span class='text'>Nehru, who had reluctantly heeded Gandhi's call for immediate independence, for he had desired to support the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] war effort during the [[Second World War]], came out of a lengthy prison term to a much altered political landscape</span>
				<span class='text'>The Muslim League under his old Congress colleague and now ''bête noire'', [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], had come to dominate Muslim politics in India</span>
				<span class='text'>Negotiations between Nehru and Jinnah for power sharing failed and gave way to the independence and bloody [[partition of India]] in 1947</span>
				<span class='text'>ehru was elected by the Congress to assume office as independent India's first Prime Minister, although the question of leadership had been settled as far back as 1941, when Gandhi acknowledged Nehru as his political heir and successor</span>
				<span class='text'>As Prime Minister, he set out to realise his vision of India</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Constitution of India]] was enacted in 1950, after which he embarked on an ambitious program of economic, social and political reforms</span>
				<span class='text'>Chiefly, he oversaw India's transition from a colony to a republic, while nurturing a plural, [[multi-party democracy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In foreign policy, he took a leading role in [[Non-Aligned Movement|Non-Alignment]] while projecting India as a regional hegemon in South Asia</span>
				<span class='text'>nder Nehru's leadership, the Congress emerged as a catch-all party, dominating national and state-level politics and winning consecutive elections in [[Indian general election, 1951|1951]], [[Indian general election, 1957|1957]], and [[Indian general election, 1962|1962]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He remained popular with the people of India in spite of political troubles in his final years and failure of leadership during the 1962 [[Sino-Indian War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In India, his birthday is celebrated as ''[[Children's Day (India)|Children's Day]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>Trevelyan]]'s [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]] books, which he had received as prizes for academic merit</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Moraes|2008|p=36}} He viewed Garibaldi as a revolutionary hero</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Moraes|2008|p=47}}After returning to India in August 1912, Nehru enrolled himself as an advocate of the [[Allahabad High Court]] and tried to settle down as a barrister</span>
				<span class='text'>But, unlike his father, he had only a desultory interest in his profession and did not relish either the practice of law or the company of lawyers</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Ghose|1993|p=25}} He was disconcerted with what he saw as a &quot;very much an English-knowing upper class affair&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Moraes|2008|p=49}} The Congress in 1912 had been the party of moderates and elites</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Ghose|1993|p=25}} Nehru harboured doubts regarding the ineffectualness of the Congress but agreed to work for the party in support of the Indian civil rights movement in South Africa</span>

				<span class='text'>Although educated Indians &quot;by and large took a vicarious pleasure&quot; in seeing the British rulers humbled, the ruling upper classes sided with the [[Triple Entente|Allies]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Nehru confessed that he viewed the war with mixed feelings</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Ghose|1993|p=26}} He ridiculed the [[British India Civil Service|Indian Civil Service]] (ICS) for its support of British policies</span>

				<span class='text'>Nehru, however, was not satisfied with the pace of the national movement</span>
				<span class='text'>He became involved with aggressive nationalists leaders who were demanding [[Home Rule]] for Indians</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Moraes|2008|p=56}}The influence of the moderates on Congress politics began to wane after Gokhale died in 1915</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Ghose|1993|p=25}} Anti-moderate leaders such as Annie Beasant and [[Lokmanya Tilak]] took the opportunity to call for a [[Indian Home Rule Movement|national movement for Home Rule]]</span>
				<span class='text'>But, in 1915, the proposal was rejected because of the reluctance of the moderates to commit to such a radical course of action</span>
				<span class='text'>Besant nevertheless formed a league for advocating Home Rule in 1916; and Tilak, on his release from a prison term, had in April 1916 formed his own league</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Ghose|1993|p=25}} Nehru joined both leagues but worked especially for the former</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Moraes|2008|p=55}} He remarked later: &quot;[Besant] had a very powerful influence on me in my childhood</span>

				<span class='text'>even later when I entered political life her influence continued</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Moraes|2008|p=55}} Another development which brought about a radical change in Indian politics was the espousal of Hindu-Muslim unity with the [[Lucknow pact]] at the annual meeting of the Congress in December 1916</span>
				<span class='text'>The pact had been initiated earlier in the year at Allahabad at a meeting of the [[All-India Congress Committee]] which was held at the Nehru residence at Anand Bhawan</span>

				<span class='text'>But as the drafting of the constitution progressed and the idea of forming a republic took concrete shape (because of the efforts of Nehru), it was decided that all the Princely states/Covenanting States would merge with the Indian republic</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Gandhi and Nehru in 1942]]Nehru elaborated the policies of the Congress and a future Indian nation under his leadership in 1929</span>
				<span class='text'>He declared that the aims of the congress were freedom of religion, right to form associations, freedom of expression of thought, equality before law for every individual without distinction of caste, colour, creed or religion, protection to regional languages and cultures, safeguarding the interests of the peasants and labour, abolition of untouchability, introduction of adult franchise, imposition of prohibition, nationalisation of industries, socialism, and establishment of a secular India</span>
				<span class='text'>All these aims formed the core of the &quot;Fundamental Rights and Economic Policy&quot; resolution drafted by Nehru in 1929–31 and were ratified by the All India Congress Committee under Gandhi's leadership</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Moraes|2008|p=196}} However, some Congress leaders objected to the resolution and decided to oppose Nehru</span>
				<span class='text'>he espousal of socialism as the Congress goal was most difficult to achieve</span>
				<span class='text'>Nehru was opposed in this by the right-wing Congressmen [[Vallabhbhai Patel|Sardar Patel]], [[Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Rajendra Prasad]] and [[Chakravarthi Rajagopalachari]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He had the support of the left-wing Congressmen [[Abul Kalam Azad|Maulana Azad]] and [[Subhas Chandra Bose]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The trio combined to oust Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Prasad as Congress President in 1936</span>
				<span class='text'>Nehru was elected in his place and held the presidency for two years (1936–37)</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Moraes|2008|p=234-238}} He was then succeeded by his socialist colleagues Bose (1938–39) and Azad (1940–46)</span>
				<span class='text'>After the fall of Bose from the mainstream of Indian politics (because of his support of violence in driving the British out of India), the power struggle between the socialists and conservatives balanced out</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Sardar Patel died in 1950, leaving Nehru as the sole remaining iconic national leader, and soon the situation became such that Nehru was able to implement many of his basic policies without hindrance</span>
				<span class='text'>The conservative right-wing of the Congress (composed of India's upper class elites) would continue opposing the socialists until the great schism in 1969</span>
				<span class='text'>Nehru's daughter, [[Indira Gandhi]], was able to fulfill her father's dream by the 42nd amendment (1976) of the Indian constitution by which India officially became &quot;socialist&quot; and &quot;secular&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Nehru's real interest in Marxism and his socialist pattern of thought stem from that tour</span>
				<span class='text'>His subsequent sojourns in prison enabled him to study Marxism in more depth</span>
				<span class='text'>Interested in its ideas but repelled by some of its methods, he could never bring himself to accept Karl Marx's writings as revealed scripture</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet from then on, the yardstick of his economic thinking remained Marxist, adjusted, where necessary, to Indian conditions</span>
				<span class='text'>hen the [[Indian National Congress|Congress party]] under Nehru chose to contest elections and accept power under the Federation scheme, Gandhi resigned from party membership</span>
				<span class='text'>Gandhi did not disagree with Nehru's move, but felt that if he resigned, his popularity with Indians would cease to stifle the party's membership</span>
				<span class='text'>When the elections following the introduction of provincial autonomy (under the government of India act 1935) brought the [[Indian National Congress|Congress party]] to power in a majority of the provinces, Nehru's popularity and power was unmatched</span>
				<span class='text'>The Muslim League under [[Mohammed Ali Jinnah]] (who was to become the creator of Pakistan) had fared badly at the polls</span>
				<span class='text'>Nehru declared that the only two parties that mattered in India were the British Raj and Congress</span>
				<span class='text'>Jinnah statements that the Muslim League was the third and &quot;equal partner&quot; within Indian politics was widely rejected</span>
				<span class='text'>Nehru had hoped to elevate [[Abul Kalam Azad|Maulana Azad]] as the pre-eminent leaders of Indian Muslims, but in this, he was undermined by Gandhi, who continued to treat Jinnah as the voice of Indian Muslims</span>
				<span class='text'>==World War II and Quit India movement===When World war II started, Viceroy Linlithgow had unilaterally declared India a belligerent on the side of the Britain, without consulting the elected Indian representatives</span>
				<span class='text'>Nehru hurried back from a visit to China, announcing that, in a conflict between democracy and Fascism, &quot;our sympathies must inevitably be on the side of democracy</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> I should like India to play its full part and throw all her resources into the struggle for a new order</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;After much deliberation the Congress under Nehru informed the government that it would co-operate with the British but on certain conditions</span>
				<span class='text'>First, Britain must give an assurance of full independence for India after the war and allow the election of a constituent assembly to frame a new constitution; second, although the Indian armed forces would remain under the British Commander-in-Chief, Indians must be included immediately in the central government and given a chance to share power and responsibility</span>
				<span class='text'>When Nehru presented Lord Linlithgow with the demands, he chose to reject them</span>
				<span class='text'>A deadlock was reached</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;The same old game is played again&quot;, Nehru wrote bitterly to Gandhi, &quot;the background is the same, the various epithets are the same and the actors are the same and the results must be the same&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>n 23 October 1939, the Congress condemned the Viceroy's attitude and called upon the Congress ministries in the various provinces to resign in protest</span>
				<span class='text'>Before this crucial announcement, Nehru urged Jinnah and the Muslim League to join the protest but the latter declined</span>
				<span class='text'>n March 1940 Jinnah passed what would come to be known as the &quot;Pakistan Resolution&quot;, declaring &quot;Muslims are a nation according to any definition of a nation, and they must have their homelands, their territory and their State</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;  This state was to be known as Pakistan, meaning &quot;Land of the Pure&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Nehru angrily declared that &quot;all the old problems </span>

				<span class='text'>pale into insignificance before the latest stand taken by the Muslim League leader in Lahore&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Linlithgow made Nehru an offer on 8 October 1940</span>
				<span class='text'>It stated that Dominion status for India was the objective of the British government</span>
				<span class='text'>However, it referred neither to a date nor method of accomplishment</span>

				<span class='text'>&quot;The British would not contemplate transferring power to a Congress-dominated national government the authority of which was &quot;denied by large and powerful elements in India's national life&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>n October 1940, Gandhi and Nehru, abandoning their original stand of supporting Britain, decided to launch a limited civil disobedience campaign in which leading advocates of Indian independence were selected to participate one by one</span>
				<span class='text'>Nehru was arrested and sentenced to four years' imprisonment</span>

				<span class='text'>Following the Quit India resolution passed by the [[Indian National Congress|Congress party]] in Bombay (now Mumbai) on 8 August 1942, the entire Congress working committee, including Gandhi and Nehru, was arrested and imprisoned</span>
				<span class='text'>Nehru emerged from this—his ninth and last detention—only on 15 June 1945</span>

				<span class='text'>In April 1943, the League captured the governments of Bengal and, a month later, that of the North West Frontier Province</span>
				<span class='text'>In none of these provinces had the League previously had a majority – only the arrest of Congress members made it possible</span>
				<span class='text'>With all the Muslim dominated provinces except the Punjab under Jinnah's control, the artificial concept of a separate Muslim State was turning into a reality</span>
				<span class='text'>However, by 1944, Jinnah's power and prestige were on the wane</span>
				<span class='text'>A general sympathy towards the jailed Congress leaders was developing among Muslims, and much of the blame for the disastrous Bengal famine of 1943–44 during which two million died, had been laid on the shoulders of the province's Muslim League government</span>
				<span class='text'>The numbers at Jinnah's meetings, once counted in thousands soon numbered only a few hundreds</span>
				<span class='text'>In despair, Jinnah left the political scene for a stay in Kashmir</span>
				<span class='text'>is prestige was restored unwittingly by Gandhi, who had been released from prison on medical grounds in May 1944 and had met Jinnah in Bombay in September</span>
				<span class='text'>There he offered the Muslim leader a plebiscite in the Muslim areas after the war to see whether they wanted to separate from the rest of India</span>
				<span class='text'>Essentially, it was an acceptance of the principle of Pakistan – but not in so many words</span>
				<span class='text'>Jinnah demanded that the exact words be said; Gandhi refused and the talks broke down</span>

				<span class='text'>]{{See also|States Reorganisation Act}}The British Indian Empire, which included present-day India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, was divided into two types of territories: the Provinces of British India, which were governed directly by British officials responsible to the Governor-General of India; and princely states, under the rule of local hereditary rulers who recognised British suzerainty in return for local autonomy, in most cases as established by treaty</span>
				<span class='text'>Between 1947 and about 1950, the territories of the princely states were politically integrated into the Indian Union under Nehru and Sardar Patel</span>
				<span class='text'>Most were merged into existing provinces; others were organised into new provinces, such as Rajputana, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Bharat, and Vindhya Pradesh, made up of multiple princely states; a few, including Mysore, Hyderabad, Bhopal, and Bilaspur, became separate provinces</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Government of India Act 1935]] remained the constitutional law of India pending adoption of a new Constitution</span>
				<span class='text'>he new Constitution of India, which came into force on 26 January 1950, made India a sovereign democratic republic</span>
				<span class='text'>Nehru declared the new republic to be a &quot;Union of States&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The constitution of 1950 distinguished between three main types of states: Part A states, which were the former governors' provinces of British India, were ruled by an elected governor and state legislature</span>
				<span class='text'>The Part B states were former princely states or groups of princely states, governed by a rajpramukh, who was usually the ruler of a constituent state, and an elected legislature</span>
				<span class='text'>The rajpramukh was appointed by the President of India</span>
				<span class='text'>The Part C states included both the former chief commissioners' provinces and some princely states, and each was governed by a chief commissioner appointed by the President of India</span>
				<span class='text'>The sole Part D state was the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, which were administered by a lieutenant governor appointed by the central government</span>
				<span class='text'>n December 1953, Nehru appointed the [[States Reorganisation Commission]] to prepare for the creation of states on linguistic lines</span>
				<span class='text'>This was headed by Justice [[Fazal Ali]] and the commission itself was also known as the Fazal Ali Commission</span>
				<span class='text'>The efforts of this commission were overseen by [[Govind Ballabh Pant]], who served as Nehru's Home Minister from December 1954</span>
				<span class='text'>The commission created a report in 1955 recommending the reorganisation of India's states</span>
				<span class='text'>Under the Seventh Amendment, the existing distinction between Part A, Part B, Part C, and Part D states was abolished</span>
				<span class='text'>The distinction between Part A and Part B states was removed, becoming known simply as &quot;states&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>A new type of entity, the union territory, replaced the classification as a Part C or Part D state</span>
				<span class='text'>Nehru stressed commonality among Indians and promoted pan-Indianism</span>

				<span class='text'>Nehru also championed secularism and religious harmony, increasing the representation of minorities in government</span>
				<span class='text'>ehru specifically wrote Article 44 of the Indian constitution under the Directive Principles of State Policy which states : 'The State shall endeavour to secure for the citizens a uniform civil code throughout the territory of India</span>

				<span class='text'>128&lt;/ref&gt; However, Nehru has been criticised for the inconsistent application of the law</span>
				<span class='text'>Most notably, Nehru allowed Muslims to keep their personal law in matters relating to marriage and inheritance</span>
				<span class='text'>Also in the small state of Goa, a civil code based on the old Portuguese Family Laws was allowed to continue, and Muslim Personal law was prohibited by Nehru</span>
				<span class='text'>This was the result of the annexation of Goa in 1961 by India, when Nehru promised the people that their laws would be left intact</span>
				<span class='text'>This has led to accusations of selective secularism</span>
				<span class='text'>hile Nehru exempted Muslim law from legislation and they remained unreformed, he did pass the Special Marriage Act in 1954</span>
				<span class='text'>The idea behind this act was to give everyone in India the ability to marry outside the personal law under a civil marriage</span>
				<span class='text'>As usual the law applied to all of India, except Jammu and Kashmir (again leading to accusations of selective secularism)</span>
				<span class='text'>In many respects, the act was almost identical to the Hindu Marriage Act of 1955, which gives some idea as to how secularised the law regarding Hindus had become</span>
				<span class='text'>The Special Marriage Act allowed Muslims to marry under it and thereby retain the protections, generally beneficial to Muslim women, that could not be found in the personal law</span>
				<span class='text'>Under the act polygamy was illegal, and inheritance and succession would be governed by the Indian Succession Act, rather than the respective Muslim Personal Law</span>
				<span class='text'>Divorce also would be governed by the secular law, and maintenance of a divorced wife would be along the lines set down in the civil law</span>
				<span class='text'>ehru led the faction of the [[Indian National Congress|Congress party]] which promoted Hindi as the lingua-franca of the Indian nation</span>
				<span class='text'>After an exhaustive and divisive debate with the non-Hindi speakers, Hindi was adopted as the official language of India in 1950 with English continuing as an associate official language for a period of fifteen years, after which Hindi would become the sole official language</span>
				<span class='text'>Efforts by the Indian Government to make Hindi the sole official language after 1965 were not acceptable to many non-Hindi Indian states, who wanted the continued use of English</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (DMK), a descendant of Dravidar Kazhagam, led the opposition to Hindi</span>
				<span class='text'>To allay their fears, Nehru enacted the Official Languages Act in 1963 to ensure the continuing use of English beyond 1965</span>
				<span class='text'>The text of the Act did not satisfy the DMK and increased their scepticism that his assurances might not be honoured by future administrations</span>
				<span class='text'>The issue was resolved during the premiership of [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]], who under great pressure from Nehru's daughter, [[Indira Gandhi]], was made to give assurances that English would continue to be used as the official language as long the non-Hindi speaking states wanted</span>
				<span class='text'>The Official Languages Act was eventually amended in 1967 by the Congress Government headed by [[Indira Gandhi]] to guarantee the indefinite use of Hindi and English as official languages</span>
				<span class='text'>This effectively ensured the current &quot;virtual indefinite policy of bilingualism&quot; of the Indian Republic</span>

				<span class='text'>n 1954 Nehru signed with China the [[Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence]], known in India as the Panchsheel (from the Sanskrit words, panch: five, sheel: virtues), a set of principles to govern relations between the two states</span>
				<span class='text'>Their first formal codification in treaty form was in an agreement between China and India in 1954</span>
				<span class='text'>They were enunciated in the preamble to the &quot;Agreement (with exchange of notes) on trade and intercourse between Tibet Region of China and India&quot;, which was signed at Peking on 29 April 1954</span>
				<span class='text'>Negotiations took place in Delhi from December 1953 to April 1954 between the Delegation of the PRC Government and the Delegation of the Indian Government on the relations between the two countries with respect to the disputed territories of [[Aksai Chin]] and South Tibet</span>
				<span class='text'>The treaty was disregarded in the 1960s, but in the 1970s, the Five Principles again came to be seen as important in [[Sino-Indian relations]], and more generally as norms of relations between states</span>

				<span class='text'>The role of Nehru, both as Indian Prime Minister and a leader of the [[Non Aligned Movement]] was significant; he tried to be even-handed between the two sides, while denouncing Eden and co-sponsors of the invasion vigorously</span>
				<span class='text'>Nehru had a powerful ally in the US president Dwight Eisenhower who, if relatively silent publicly, went to the extent of using America's clout in the [[IMF]] to make Britain and France back down</span>
				<span class='text'>The episode greatly raised the prestige of Nehru and India amongst the third world nations</span>
				<span class='text'>During the [[Suez crisis]], Nehru's right-hand man, Menon attempted to persuade a recalcitrant [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Gamal Nasser]] to compromise with the West, and was instrumental in moving Western powers towards an awareness that Nasser might prove willing to compromise</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1957, Menon was instructed to deliver an unprecedented eight-hour speech defending India's stand on Kashmir; to date, the speech is the longest ever delivered in the [[United Nations Security Council]], covering five hours of the 762nd meeting on 23 January, and two hours and forty-eight minutes on the 24th, reportedly concluding with Menon's collapse on the Security Council floor</span>
				<span class='text'>During the [[filibuster]], Nehru moved swiftly and successfully to consolidate Indian power in Kashmir (then under great unrest)</span>
				<span class='text'>Menon's passionate defence of Indian sovereignty in Kashmir enlarged his base of support in India, and led to the Indian press temporarily dubbing him the 'Hero of Kashmir'</span>
				<span class='text'>Nehru was then at the peak of his popularity in India; the only (minor) criticism came from the far-right</span>

				<span class='text'>However, [[Cold War]] suspicions and the American distrust of Nehruvian socialism cooled relations between India and the US, which suspected Nehru of tacitly supporting the Soviet Union</span>
				<span class='text'>Nehru maintained good relations with Britain even after the Suez Crisis</span>
				<span class='text'>Nehru accepted the arbitration of the UK and World Bank, signing the [[Indus Water Treaty]] in 1960 with Pakistani ruler [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] to resolve long-standing disputes about sharing the resources of the major rivers of the Punjab region</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough the [[Pancha Sila]] (Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence) was the basis of the 1954 Sino-Indian border treaty, in later years, Nehru's foreign policy suffered through increasing Chinese assertiveness over border disputes and Nehru's decision to grant [[political asylum]] to the [[14th Dalai Lama]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After years of failed negotiations, Nehru authorised the [[Indian Army]] to [[Invasion of Goa|invade]] Portuguese controlled [[Portuguese India|Goa]] in 1961, and then he formally annexed it to India</span>
				<span class='text'>It increased his popularity in India, but he was criticised by the communist opposition in India for the use of military force</span>

				<span class='text'>The war exposed the unpreparedness of India's military which could send only 14,000 troops to the war zone in opposition to the many times larger Chinese army, and Nehru was widely criticised for his government's insufficient attention to defence</span>

				<span class='text'>he aftermath of the war saw sweeping changes in the Indian military to prepare it for similar conflicts in the future, and placed pressure on Nehru, who was seen as responsible for failing to anticipate the Chinese attack on India</span>
				<span class='text'>Under American advice (by American envoy John Kenneth Galbraith who made and ran American policy on the war as all other top policy makers in USA were absorbed in coincident Cuban Missile Crisis) Nehru refrained, not according to the best choices available, from using the Indian air force to beat back the Chinese advances</span>
				<span class='text'>The CIA later revealed that at that time the Chinese had neither the fuel nor runways long enough for using their air force effectively in Tibet</span>
				<span class='text'>Indians in general became highly sceptical of China and its military</span>

				<span class='text'>The war also put an end to Nehru's earlier hopes that India and China would form a strong Asian Axis to counteract the increasing influence of the Cold War bloc superpowers</span>
