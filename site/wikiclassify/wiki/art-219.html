				<span class='text'>erdi was born near [[Busseto]] to a provincial family of moderate means, and developed a musical education with the help of a local patron</span>
				<span class='text'> Verdi came to dominate the Italian opera scene after the era of [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]] and [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]], whose works significantly influenced him, becoming one of the pre-eminent opera composers in history</span>
				<span class='text'>n his early operas Verdi demonstrated a sympathy with the [[Risorgimento]] movement which sought the unification of Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>He also participated briefly as an elected politician</span>
				<span class='text'>The chorus &quot;[[Va, pensiero]]&quot; from his early opera ''[[Nabucco]]'' (1842), and similar choruses in later operas, were much in the spirit of the unification movement, and the composer himself became esteemed as a representative of these ideals</span>
				<span class='text'>An intensely private person, Verdi however did not seek to ingratiate himself with popular movements and as he became professionally successful was able to reduce his operatic workload and sought to establish himself as a landowner in his native region</span>
				<span class='text'>He surprised the musical world by returning, after his success with the opera ''[[Aida]]'' (1871), with three late masterpieces: his [[Requiem (Verdi)|Requiem]] (1874), and the operas ''[[Otello]]'' (1887) and ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]'' (1893)</span>
				<span class='text'>is operas remain extremely popular, especially the three peaks of his 'middle period': ''[[Rigoletto]], [[Il trovatore]]'' and ''[[La traviata]]'', and the bicentenary of his birth in 2013 was widely celebrated in broadcasts and performances</span>

				<span class='text'>-&gt;]]Verdi, the first child of Carlo Giuseppe Verdi (1785–1867) and Luigia Uttini (1787–1851), was born at their home in [[Le Roncole]], a village near [[Busseto]], then in the [[Taro (département)|Département Taro]] and within the borders of  the [[First French Empire]] following the annexation of the [[Duchy of Parma and Piacenza]] in 1808</span>
				<span class='text'>The baptismal register, prepared on 11 October 1813, lists his parents Carlo and Luigia as &quot;innkeeper&quot; and  &quot;spinner&quot; respectively</span>
				<span class='text'> Additionally, it lists Verdi as being &quot;born yesterday&quot;, but since days were often considered to begin at sunset, this could have meant either 9 or 10 October</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Parker|n</span>

				<span class='text'>loc= §2}} Verdi himself, following his mother, always celebrated his birthday on 9 October</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Rosselli|2000|p=12}}Verdi had a younger sister, Giuseppa, who died aged 17 in 1833</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Rosselli|2000|p=12}} From the age of four, Verdi was given private lessons in Latin and Italian by the village schoolmaster, Baistrocchi, and at six he attended the local school</span>
				<span class='text'>After learning to play the [[organ (music)|organ]], he showed so much interest in music that his parents finally provided him with a [[spinet]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Rosselli|2000|p=14}} Verdi's gift for music was already apparent by 1820–21 when he began his association with the local church, serving in the choir, acting as an [[altar boy]] for a while, and taking organ lessons</span>
				<span class='text'>After Baistrocchi's death, Verdi, at the age of eight, became the official paid organist</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Parker|1998|p=933}}In 1823, when he was 10, Verdi's parents arranged for the boy to attend school in Busseto, enrolling him in a ''Ginnasio''—an upper school for boys—run by Don Pietro Seletti, while they continued to run their inn at Le Roncole</span>
				<span class='text'>Verdi returned to Busseto regularly to play the organ on Sundays, covering the distance of several kilometres on foot</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Phillips-Matz|1993|p=20–21}} At age 11, Verdi received schooling in Italian, Latin, the humanities, and rhetoric</span>
				<span class='text'>By the time he was 12, he began lessons with [[Ferdinando Provesi]], ''maestro di cappella'' at San Bartolomeo, director of the municipal music school and co-director of the local ''Società Filarmonica'' (Philharmonic Society)</span>
				<span class='text'>Verdi later stated: &quot;From the ages of 13 to 18 I wrote a motley assortment of pieces: marches for band by the hundred, perhaps as many little ''sinfonie'' that were used in church, in the theatre and at concerts, five or six [[concerto]]s and sets of [[variation (music)|variations]] for pianoforte, which I played myself at concerts, many [[serenade]]s, [[cantata]]s ([[aria]]s, duets, very many trios) and various pieces of church music, of which I remember only a ''[[Stabat Mater]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>The young Verdi did not immediately become involved with the Philharmonic</span>
				<span class='text'>By June 1827, he had graduated with honours from the ''Ginnasio'' and was able to focus solely on music under Provesi</span>
				<span class='text'>By chance, when he was 13, Verdi was asked to step in as a replacement to play in what became his first public event in his home town; he was an immediate success mostly playing his own music to the surprise of many and receiving strong local recognition</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Phillips-Matz|1993|p=27–30}}By 1829–30, Verdi had established himself as a leader of the Philharmonic: &quot;none of us could rival him&quot; reported the secretary of the organisation, Giuseppe Demaldè</span>
				<span class='text'>An eight-movement cantata, ''I deliri di Saul'', based on a drama by [[Vittorio Alfieri]], was written by Verdi when he was 15 and performed in [[Bergamo]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It was acclaimed by both Demaldè and Barezzi, who commented: &quot;He shows a vivid imagination, a philosophical outlook, and sound judgment in the arrangement of instrumental parts</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Phillips-Matz|1993|p=32}} In late 1829, Verdi had completed his studies with Provesi, who declared that he had no more to teach him</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Phillips-Matz|1993|p=35}} At the time, Verdi had been giving singing and piano lessons to Barezzi's daughter Margherita; by 1831, they were unofficially engaged</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Parker|2007|p=1}} Verdi began making connections in the Milanese world of music that were to stand him in good stead</span>
				<span class='text'>These included an introduction by Lavigna to an amateur choral group, the ''Società Filarmonica'', led by Pietro Massini</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Werfel|Stefan|1973|p=80–93}} Attending the ''Società'' frequently in 1834, Verdi soon found himself functioning as rehearsal director (for Rossini's ''[[La cenerentola]]'') and continuo player</span>
				<span class='text'>It was Massini who encouraged him to write his first opera, originally titled ''Rocester'', to a libretto by the journalist Antonio Piazza</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Phillips-Matz|1993|p=67}} Eventually in 1835 Verdi became director of the Busseto school with a three-year contract</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Werfel|Stefan|1973|p=87–92}} By the autumn of 1841 it was complete, originally under the title ''Nabucodonosor''</span>
				<span class='text'>Well received at its first performance on 9 March 1842, ''Nabucco'' underpinned Verdi's success until his retirement from the theatre, twenty-nine operas (including some revised and updated versions) later</span>

				<span class='text'>This period was not without its frustrations and setbacks for the young composer, and he was frequently demoralised</span>
				<span class='text'>In April 1845, in connection with ''[[I due Foscari]]'', he wrote: &quot;I am happy, no matter what reception it gets, and I am utterly indifferent to everything</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Phillips-Matz|1993|p=379}}After the initial success of ''Nabucco'', Verdi settled in Milan, making a number of influential acquaintances</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Parker|n</span>

				<span class='text'>loc= §3}} A revival of ''Nabucco'' followed in 1842 at La Scala where it received a run of fifty-seven performances,{{sfn|Phillips-Matz|1993|p=139}} and this led to a commission from Merelli for a new opera for the 1843 season</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[I Lombardi alla prima crociata]]'' was based on a libretto by Solera and premiered in February 1843</span>
				<span class='text'>Inevitably, comparisons were made with ''Nabucco''; but one contemporary writer noted: &quot;If [''Nabucco''] created this young man's reputation, ''I Lombardi'' served to confirm it</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Budden|1984a|p=116}}Verdi paid close attention to his financial contracts, making sure he was appropriately remunerated as his popularity increased</span>
				<span class='text'>For ''I Lombardi'' and ''[[Ernani]]'' (1844) in Venice he was paid 12,000 lire (including supervision of the productions); ''[[Attila (opera)|Attila]]'' and ''[[Macbeth (opera)|Macbeth]]'' (1847), each brought him 18,000 lire</span>
				<span class='text'>His contracts with the publishers [[Casa Ricordi|Ricordi]] in 1847 were very specific about the amounts he was to receive for new works, first productions, musical arrangements, and so on</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Porter|1980|p=649}} He began to use his growing prosperity to invest in land near his birthplace</span>

				<span class='text'>Later that year, he also bought the Palazzo Cavalli (now known as the Palazzo Orlandi) on the via Roma, Busseto's main street</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Phillips-Matz|1993|p=160–161}} In May 1848, Verdi signed a contract for land and houses at Sant'Agata in Busseto, which had once belonged to his family</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Budden|1993|p=45}} It was here he built his own house, completed in 1880, now known as the [[Villa Verdi]], where he lived from 1851 until his death</span>

				<span class='text'>Verdi remained in Parma for some weeks beyond his intended departure date</span>
				<span class='text'>This fuelled speculation that the delay was due to Strepponi (who stated that their relationship began in 1843)</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Phillips-Matz|1993|p=150–151}} Strepponi was in fact known for her amorous relationships (and many illegitimate children) and her history was an awkward factor in their relationship until they eventually agreed on marriage</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Kerman|2006|p=23}}After successful stagings of ''Nabucco'' in Venice (with twenty-five performances in the 1842/43 season), Verdi began negotiations with the impresario of [[La Fenice]] to stage ''I Lombardi'', and to write a new opera</span>

				<span class='text'></span>

				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Rosselli|2000|p=1}}That is not to say his operas did not come as great innovations</span>
				<span class='text'>What sounds to a modern listener as derivative of the bel canto, his first major success, ''[[Nabucco]]'', came as a something entirely new</span>

				<span class='text'>No longer was there the empty vocal display of the [[bel canto]] period composers</span>
				<span class='text'>Granted, there is a significant amount of vocal fireworks, but they exist for the purpose of drama, not to show off singers</span>

				<span class='text'>Before ''Nabucco'', an opera's chorus was limited to be only a background voice, another instrument</span>
				<span class='text'>In Nabucco, this is abolished; he uses the chorus as character, to show the suffering and consensus of the people</span>

				<span class='text'>==Periods===The earliest study of Verdi's music, published in 1859 by the Italian critic Abraham Basevi, already distinguished four periods in Verdi's music</span>
				<span class='text'>The early, 'grandiose' period, ended according to Basevi with ''La battaglia di Legnano'' (1849), and a 'personal' style began with the next opera ''Luisa Miller</span>
				<span class='text'>' These two operas are generally agreed today by critics to mark the division between Verdi's 'early' and 'middle' periods</span>
				<span class='text'>The 'middle' period is felt to end with ''La traviata'' (1853) and ''[[Les vêpres siciliennes]]'' (1855), with a 'late' period commencing with ''[[Simon Boccanegra]]'' (1857) running through to ''[[Aida]]'' (1871)</span>
				<span class='text'>The last two operas, ''[[Otello]]'' and ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]'', together with the [[Requiem (Verdi)|Requiem]] and the ''Four Sacred Pieces,'' then represent a 'final' period</span>

				<span class='text'>The success of &quot;Va, pensiero&quot; in ''Nabucco'' (which Rossini approvingly denoted as &quot;a grand aria sung by sopranos, contraltos, tenors and basses&quot;), was replicated in the similar &quot;O Signor, dal tetto natio&quot; in ''I lombardi'' and in 1844 in the chorus &quot;Si ridesti il Leon di Castiglia&quot; in ''Ernani'', the battle hymn of the conspirators seeking freedom{{sfn|Taruskin|2010|p=570–75}}{{sfn|Budden|1993|p=21}} In ''I due Foscari'' Verdi first uses recurring themes identified with main characters; here and in future operas the accent moves away from the '[[oratorio]]' characteristics of the first operas towards individual action and intrigue</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>loc=§4 (vii)}}From this period onwards Verdi also develops his instinct for &quot;tinta&quot; (literally 'colour'), a term which he used for characterising elements of an individual opera score – Parker gives as an example &quot;the rising [[Major sixth|6th]] that begins so many lyric pieces in ''[[Ernani]]''&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>nd an acute attention to fine detail</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Chusid|1997|p=1}} Others echo those feelings</span>
				<span class='text'>Julian Budden expresses the impact of ''Rigoletto'' and its place in Verdi's output as follows: &quot;Just after 1850 at the age of 38, Verdi closed the door on a period of Italian opera with ''Rigoletto''</span>
				<span class='text'>The so-called ''ottocento'' in music is finished</span>
				<span class='text'>Verdi will continue to draw on certain of its forms for the next few operas, but in a totally new spirit</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Budden|1984a|p=510}} One example of Verdi's wish to move away from &quot;standard forms&quot; appears in his feelings about the structure of ''Il trovatore''</span>
				<span class='text'>To his librettist, Cammarano, Verdi plainly states in a letter of April 1851 that if there were no standard forms – &quot;cavatinas, duets, trios, choruses, finales, etc</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>and if you could avoid beginning with an opening chorus</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;, he would be quite happy</span>
				<span class='text'>{{sfn|Budden|1984b|p=61}}Two external factors had their impacts on Verdi's compositions of this period</span>
				<span class='text'>One is that with increasing reputation and financial security he no longer needed to commit himself to the productive treadmill, had more freedom to choose his own subjects, and had more time to develop them according to his own ideas</span>
				<span class='text'>In the years 1849 to 1859 he wrote eight new operas, compared with fourteen in the previous ten years</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Chusid|1997|p=3}}Another factor was the changed political situation; the failure of the 1848 revolutions led both to some diminution of the Risorgimento ethos (at least initially) and a significant increase in theatre censorship</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Chusid|1997|p=3}}  This is reflected both in Verdi's choices of plots dealing more with personal relationships than political conflict, and in a (partly consequent) dramatic reduction in the operas of this period in the  number of choruses (of the type which had first made him famous) – not only are there on average 40% fewer choruses in the 'middle' period operas compared to the 'early' period', but whereas virtually all the 'early' operas commence with a chorus, only one (''Luisa Miller'') of the 'middle' period operas begin this way</span>

				<span class='text'>They also reflect a shift towards the French genre of grand opera, notable in more colorful orchestration, counterpointing of serious and comic scenes, and greater spectacle</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Parker|n</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>loc=§6 (i)}} The opportunities of transforming Italian opera by utilising such resources appealed to him</span>
				<span class='text'>For a commission from the Paris Opéra he expressly demanded a libretto from [[Eugène Scribe]], the favorite librettist of Meyerbeer, telling him: &quot;I want – in fact, I must have – a grandiose, impassioned and original subject</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The result was ''Les vêpres siciliennes'', and the scenarios of ''Simon Boccanegra'' (1857), ''Un ballo in maschera'' (1859), ''La forza del destino'' (1862), ''Don Carlos'' (1865) and ''Aida'' (1872) all meet the same criteria</span>
				<span class='text'>Porter notes that ''Un ballo'' marks an almost complete synthesis of Verdi's style with the grand opera hallmarks, such that &quot;huge spectacle is not mere decoration but essential to the drama</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>usical and theatrical lines remain taut [and] the characters still sing as warmly, passionately and personally as in ''Il trovatore''</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Porter|1980|p=653–655}}''Aida'' marks a return to earlier days in many ways</span>
				<span class='text'>The plot as in the first operas centers on love and heroism; the music is relatively 'four-square' and oriented to sensation and spectacle</span>
				<span class='text'>When the composer [[Ferdinand Hiller]] asked Verdi whether he preferred ''Aida'' or ''Don Carlos'', Verdi replied that ''Aida'' had &quot;more bite and (if you'll forgive the word), more ''theatricality''</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Budden|1993|p=272}} During the rehearsals for the Naples production of ''Aida'' Verdi amused himself by writing his only string quartet, a sprightly work which shows in its last movement that he had not lost the skill for fugue-writing that he had learned with Lavigna</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Rosselli|2000|p=161–2}} Verdi's tone painting at the opening of the Requiem is vividly described by the Italian composer [[Ildebrando Pizzetti]],  writing in 1941: &quot;in [the words] murmured by an invisible crowd over the slow swaying of a few simple chords, you straightaway sense the fear and sadness of a vast multitude before the mystery of death</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taruskin|2010|p=602–603}} Budden points out that there is little in the music of ''Otello'' that relates either to the ''[[verismo]]'' opera of the younger Italian composers, and little if anything which can be construed as a homage to the [[New German School]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Budden|1993|p=281}} Nonetheless there is still much originality, building on the strengths which Verdi had already demonstrated; the powerful storm which opens the opera ''[[in medias res]]'', the recollection of the love duet of Act I in Otello's dying words (more an aspect of ''tinta'' than ''[[leitmotif]]''), imaginative touches of harmony in Iago's &quot;Ero la notte&quot; (Act II)</span>
