				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt;===''The Dark Tower'' books==={{Main|The Dark Tower (series)}}In the late 1970s, King began what became a series of interconnected stories about a lone gunslinger, Roland, who pursues the &quot;Man in Black&quot; in an alternate-reality universe that is a cross between [[J</span>
				<span class='text'>R</span>
				<span class='text'>R</span>
				<span class='text'>Tolkien]]'s [[Middle-earth]] and the American [[Wild West]] as depicted by [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[Sergio Leone]] in their [[spaghetti Western]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>The first of these stories, ''[[The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger]]'', was initially published in five installments by ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction]]'' under the editorship of [[Edward L</span>
				<span class='text'>Ferman]], from 1977 to 1981</span>
				<span class='text'>''The Gunslinger'' was continued as an eight-book epic series called ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]]'', which books King wrote and published infrequently over four decades</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1982, the fantasy small-press [[Donald M</span>
				<span class='text'>Grant, Publisher, Inc</span>
				<span class='text'>Donald M</span>
				<span class='text'>Grant]] (known for publishing the entire canon of [[Robert E</span>
				<span class='text'>Howard]]) printed these stories for the first time together in hardcover form with color and black-and-white illustrations by fantasy artist [[Michael Whelan]], as ''[[The Gunslinger]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Each chapter was named for the story previously published in magazine form</span>
				<span class='text'>King dedicated the hardcover edition to his editor at ''F&amp;SF'', Ed Ferman, who &quot;took a chance on these stories&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The original [[print run]] was only 10,000 copies, which was, by this time, a comparatively low run for a first printing of a King novel in hardcover</span>
				<span class='text'>His 1980 novel, ''[[Firestarter (novel)|Firestarter]]'', had an initial print run in trade hardcover of 100,000 copies, and his 1983 novel, ''[[Christine (novel)|Christine]]'', had a trade hardcover print run of 250,000 copies, both by the much larger publisher [[Viking Press|Viking]]</span>
				<span class='text'>''The Gunslinger'''s initial release was not highly publicized, and only specialty science-fiction and related bookstores carried it on their shelves</span>
				<span class='text'>The book was generally unavailable in the larger chain stores, except by special order</span>
				<span class='text'>Rumors spread among avid fans that there was a King book out that few readers knew about, let alone had actually read</span>
				<span class='text'>When the initial 10,000 copies sold out, Grant printed another 10,000 copies in 1984, but these runs were still far short of the growing demand among fans for this book</span>
				<span class='text'> Both the first and second printings of ''The Gunslinger'' garner premium prices on the collectible book market, notably among avid readers and collectors of Stephen King, horror literature, fantasy literature, and American western literature, and fans of Michael Whelan's artwork</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=May 2012}}In 1987, King released the second installment, ''[[The Dark Tower II: The Drawing of the Three]]'', in which Roland draws three people from 20th-century United States into his world through magical doors</span>
				<span class='text'>Grant published ''The Drawing of the Three'', with illustrations by [[Phil Hale]], in a slightly larger run of 30,000 copies, which was still well below King's typical initial hardcover print run of a new book</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[It (novel)|It]]'', published in 1986, had an initial print run of 1,000,000 copies, King's largest to date</span>
				<span class='text'>{clarify|date=August 2013}} King had believed that the ''Dark Tower'' books would be of interest to only a select group of his fans, and he had resisted releasing it on a larger scale</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally, in the late 1980s, bowing to pressure from his publishers and fans who were searching for the books (at this point fewer than 50,000 of his millions of readers would have been able to own any of the ''Dark Tower'' books), King agreed to release ''The Gunslinger'' and all subsequent ''Dark Tower'' books in trade paperback and mass-market formats</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=May 2012}}In the early 2000s, King revised the original book, ''The Gunslinger'', because he felt the voice and imagery of the original stories of the late 1970s did not seem to fit the voice of the final installment of 2004; King felt the style of the work had markedly changed during the intervening 27 years</span>
				<span class='text'>The revised version was published in 2003 by his former hardcover publisher Viking</span>
				<span class='text'>Grant published its hardcover limited edition of the revised version of ''The Gunslinger'' along with a prequel story set in the Dark Tower world called &quot;[[The Little Sisters of Eluria]]&quot; (originally published in 1998 in the collection ''[[Legends (book)|Legends: Short Novels by the Masters of Modern Fantasy]]'') in 2009</span>
				<span class='text'>===Adaptations====In October 2005, King signed a deal with [[Marvel Comics]] to publish a seven-issue [[limited series]] spin-off of the series called ''[[The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger Born|The Gunslinger Born]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The series, which focuses on a young [[Roland Deschain]], was plotted by Robin Furth, with dialogue by [[Peter David]], and illustrated by [[Eisner Award]]-winning artist [[Jae Lee]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The first issue was published on February 7, 2007, and King, David, Lee, and Marvel Editor-in-Chief [[Joe Quesada]] appeared at a midnight signing at a [[Times Square]], New York comic book store to promote it</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;In his book ''The Philosophy of Horror'' (1990), [[NoÃ«l Carroll]] discusses King's work as an exemplar of modern horror fiction</span>
				<span class='text'>Analyzing both the narrative structure of King's fiction and King's non-fiction ruminations on the art and craft of writing, Carroll writes that for King, &quot;the horror story is always a contest between the normal and the abnormal such that the normal is reinstated and, therefore, affirmed</span>

				<span class='text'>Despite these criticisms, Joshi argues that since ''[[Gerald's Game]]'' (1993), King has been tempering the worst of his writing faults, producing books that are leaner, more believable and generally better written</span>
				<span class='text'>Joshi suggests that King's strengths as a writer include the accessible &quot;[[everyman]]&quot; quality of his prose, and his unfailingly insightful observations about the pains and joys of adolescence</span>
				<span class='text'>Joshi cites two early non-supernatural novelsâ€”''[[Rage (Stephen King novel)|Rage]]'' (1977) and ''[[The Running Man (novel)|The Running Man]]'' (1982)â€”as King's best, suggesting both are riveting and well-constructed [[suspense thriller]]s, with believable characters</span>

				<span class='text'> While conceding that he saw no artistic merit in some violent video games, King also opined that such games reflect the violence that already exists in society, which would not be lessened by such a law, and would be redundant in light of the ratings system that already exists for video games</span>
