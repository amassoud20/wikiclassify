				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This three-dimensional structure accounted for the [[isomer]]s found in nature</span>
				<span class='text'>He shares credit for this  with the French chemist [[Joseph Le Bel]], who independently came up with the same idea</span>
				<span class='text'>hree months before his doctoral degree was awarded Van 't Hoff published this theory, which today is regarded as the foundation of [[stereochemistry]], first in a Dutch pamphlet in the fall of 1874, and then in the following May in a small French book entitled ''La chimie dans l'espace''</span>
				<span class='text'>A German translation appeared in 1877, at a time when the only job van 't Hoff could find was at the Veterinary School in Utrecht</span>
				<span class='text'> In these early years his theory was largely ignored by the scientific community, and was sharply criticized by one prominent chemist, [[Hermann Kolbe]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Kolbe wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;A Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>J</span>
				<span class='text'>H</span>
				<span class='text'>van ’t Hoff of the Veterinary School at Utrecht has no liking, apparently, for exact chemical investigation</span>
				<span class='text'>He has considered it more convenient to mount Pegasus (apparently borrowed from the Veterinary School) and to proclaim in his ''‘La chimie dans l’espace’'' how, in his bold flight to the top of the chemical Parnassus, the atoms appeared to him to be arranged in cosmic space</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  However, by about 1880 support for van 't Hoff's theory by such important chemists as [[Johannes Wislicenus]] and [[Viktor Meyer]] brought recognition</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1884, Van 't Hoff published his research on chemical kinetics, titled ''Études de Dynamique chimique'' (''&quot;Studies in Chemical Dynamics&quot;''), in which he described a new method for determining the [[Order (chemistry)|order of a reaction]] using [[graphics]] and applied the laws of [[thermodynamics]] to chemical equilibria</span>
				<span class='text'>He also introduced the modern concept of [[chemical affinity]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1886, he showed a similarity between the behaviour of dilute solutions and gases</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1887, he and German chemist [[Wilhelm Ostwald]] founded an influential scientific magazine named  ''Zeitschrift für physikalische Chemie'' (&quot;''Journal of Physical Chemistry''&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>He worked on [[Svante Arrhenius]]'s theory of the dissociation of [[electrolytes]] and in 1889 provided physical justification for the [[Arrhenius equation]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1896, he became a professor at the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in Berlin</span>
				<span class='text'>His studies of the salt deposits at [[Stassfurt]] were an important contribution to Prussia's chemical industry</span>
				<span class='text'>an 't Hoff became a lecturer in chemistry and physics at the [[Veterinary medicine|Veterinary]] College in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He then worked as a professor of chemistry, [[mineralogy]], and [[geology]] at the [[University of Amsterdam]] for almost 18 years before eventually becoming the chairman of the chemistry department</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1896, Van 't Hoff moved to Germany, where he finished his career at the [[University of Berlin]] in 1911</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1901, he received the first [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for his work with solutions</span>
				<span class='text'>His work showed that very dilute solutions follow mathematical laws that closely resemble the laws describing the behavior of [[gas]]es</span>

				<span class='text'>He was awarded the [[Davy Medal]] of the [[Royal Society]] in 1893 (along with [[Joseph Le Bel|Le Bel]]), and elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1897|Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1897]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was awarded the Helmholtz Medal of the Prussian Academy of Sciences (1911) and appointed ''Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur'' (1894) and ''Senator der Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gesellschaft'' (1911)</span>
				<span class='text'>Van 't Hoff became an honorary member of the [[British Chemical Society]] in London, the [[Royal Dutch Academy of Sciences]] (1892), [[American Chemical Society]] (1898), and the [[Académie des Sciences]], in Paris (1905)</span>
