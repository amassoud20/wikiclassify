				<span class='text'>Both the Duke of Kent and King George III died in 1820, and Victoria was raised under close supervision by her German-born mother [[Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld]]</span>
				<span class='text'>She inherited the throne aged 18, after her father's three elder brothers had all died, leaving no surviving legitimate children</span>
				<span class='text'>The United Kingdom was already an established [[constitutional monarchy]], in which the sovereign held relatively little direct political power</span>
				<span class='text'>Privately, Victoria attempted to influence government policy and ministerial appointments; publicly, she became a national icon who was identified with strict standards of personal morality</span>
				<span class='text'>ictoria married her first cousin, [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]], in 1840</span>
				<span class='text'>Their [[#Issue|nine children]] married into royal and noble families across the continent, tying them together and earning her the sobriquet &quot;the grandmother of Europe&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>After Albert's death in 1861, Victoria plunged into deep mourning and avoided public appearances</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result of her seclusion, [[Republicanism in the United Kingdom|republicanism]] temporarily gained strength, but in the latter half of her reign her popularity recovered</span>

				<span class='text'>Until 1817, Edward's niece, [[Princess Charlotte of Wales]], was the only legitimate grandchild of George III</span>
				<span class='text'>Her death in 1817 precipitated a succession crisis that brought pressure on the Duke of Kent and his unmarried brothers to marry and have children</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1818 he married [[Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld]], a widowed German princess with two children—[[Carl, 3rd Prince of Leiningen|Carl]] (1804–1856) and [[Princess Feodora of Leiningen|Feodora]] (1807–1872)—by her first marriage to the [[Emich Carl, 2nd Prince of Leiningen|Prince of Leiningen]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Her godparents were Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia]] (represented by her uncle the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]]), her uncle the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]], her aunt [[Charlotte, Princess Royal|Queen Charlotte of Württemberg]] (represented by Victoria's aunt [[Princess Augusta Sophia of the United Kingdom|Princess Augusta]]) and Victoria's maternal grandmother the [[Countess Augusta of Reuss-Ebersdorf|Dowager Duchess of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld]] (represented by Victoria's aunt [[Princess Mary, Duchess of Gloucester and Edinburgh]])</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; She was baptised ''Alexandrina'', after one of her godparents, Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia]], and ''Victoria'' after her mother</span>
				<span class='text'>Additional names proposed by her parents—Georgina (or Georgiana), Charlotte, and Augusta—were dropped on the instructions of the Duke's elder brother, the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]] (later George IV)</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Longford, p</span>
				<span class='text'>24&lt;/ref&gt; The Prince Regent and the Duke of York were estranged from their wives, who were both past child-bearing age, so the two eldest brothers were unlikely to have any further children</span>
				<span class='text'>The Dukes of Kent and Clarence married on the same day 12 months before Victoria's birth, but both of Clarence's daughters (born in 1819 and 1820 respectively) died as infants</span>
				<span class='text'>Victoria's grandfather and father died in 1820, within a week of each other, and the Duke of York died in 1827</span>
				<span class='text'>On the death of her uncle George IV in 1830, Victoria became [[heir presumptive|heiress presumptive]] to her next surviving uncle, William IV</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Regency Act 1830]] made special provision for the Duchess of Kent to act as regent in case William died while Victoria was still a minor</span>

				<span class='text'>25&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother was extremely protective, and Victoria was raised largely isolated from other children under the so-called &quot;[[Kensington System]]&quot;, an elaborate set of rules and protocols devised by the Duchess and her ambitious and domineering [[comptroller]], Sir [[John Conroy]], who was rumoured to be the Duchess's lover</span>

				<span class='text'>The rumours were false in the opinion of these biographers</span>
