				<span class='text'>{{note|term}} Formally allied with the [[Iron Guard]] (1940–41)}}'''Ion Victor Antonescu''' ({{IPA-ro|iˈon antoˈnesku|-|Ro-Ion Antonescu</span>
				<span class='text'>gg}}; June 15, 1882 – June 1, 1946) was a [[Romania]]n soldier and [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] politician who, as the [[Prime Minister of Romania|Prime Minister]] and ''[[Conducător]]'' during most of [[World War II]], presided over two successive [[Romania during World War II|wartime dictatorships]]</span>
				<span class='text'> After the war, he was convicted of [[war crime]]s and executed</span>
				<span class='text'> [[Romanian Army]] career officer who made his name during the [[1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt|1907 peasants' revolt]] and the [[World War I]] [[Romania during World War I|Romanian Campaign]], the [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] Antonescu sympathized with the [[far right]] and [[Fascism|fascist]] [[National Christian Party|National Christian]] and [[Iron Guard]] groups for much of the [[interwar period]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a [[military attaché]] to [[France]] and later [[Chief of the Romanian General Staff|Chief of the General Staff]], briefly serving as [[Ministry of National Defense (Romania)|Defense Minister]] in the National Christian cabinet of [[Octavian Goga]]</span>
				<span class='text'>During the late 1930s, his political stance brought him into conflict with [[King of Romania|King]] [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]] and led to his detainment</span>
				<span class='text'>Antonescu nevertheless rose to political prominence during the political crisis of 1940, and established the [[National Legionary State]], an uneasy partnership with the Iron Guard's leader [[Horia Sima]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After entering Romania into an alliance with [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Axis powers|Axis]] and ensuring [[Adolf Hitler]]'s confidence, he eliminated the Guard during the [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom|Legionary Rebellion]] of 1941</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition to leadership of the executive, he assumed the offices of [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Romania)|Foreign Affairs]] and Defense Minister</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon after Romania joined the Axis in [[Operation Barbarossa]], recovering [[Bessarabia]] and [[Northern Bukovina]], Antonescu also became [[Marshal of Romania]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n atypical figure among [[Holocaust]] perpetrators, Antonescu enforced policies independently responsible for the deaths of as many as 400,000 people, most of them [[Bessarabian Jews|Bessarabian]], [[History of the Jews in Ukraine|Ukrainian]] and [[History of the Jews in Romania|Romanian Jews]], as well as [[Roma minority in Romania|Romanian Romani]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The regime's [[Holocaust in Romania|complicity in the Holocaust]] combined [[pogrom]]s and [[mass murder]]s such as the [[1941 Odessa massacre|Odessa massacre]] with [[ethnic cleansing]], systematic deportations to occupied [[Transnistria (World War II)|Transnistria]] and widespread [[criminal negligence]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The system in place was nevertheless characterized by singular inconsistencies, prioritizing plunder over killing, showing leniency toward most Jews in the [[Romanian Old Kingdom|Old Kingdom]], and ultimately refusing to adopt the [[Final Solution]] as applied throughout [[Nazi-occupied Europe]]</span>
				<span class='text'>onfronted with heavy losses on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], Antonescu embarked on inconclusive negotiations with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], just before a political coalition, formed around the young monarch [[Michael I of Romania|Michael I]], toppled him during the [[King Michael's Coup|August 23, 1944, Coup]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After a brief detention in the [[Soviet Union]], the deposed ''Conducător'' was handed back to Romania, where he was tried by a special [[Romanian People's Tribunals|People's Tribunal]] and executed</span>
				<span class='text'>This was part of a series of trials that also passed sentences on his various associates, as well as his wife [[Maria Antonescu|Maria]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The judicial procedures earned much criticism for responding to the [[Romanian Communist Party]]'s ideological priorities, a matter that fueled [[Nationalism|nationalist]] and far right attempts to have Antonescu posthumously exonerated</span>
				<span class='text'>While these groups elevated Antonescu to the status of hero, his involvement in the Holocaust was officially reasserted and condemned following the 2003 [[Wiesel Commission]] report</span>
				<span class='text'>=Biography=====Early life and career===Born in the town of [[Pitești]], north-west of the capital [[Bucharest]], Antonescu was the scion of an [[upper-middle class]] [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] family with some military tradition</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=d37&gt;Deletant, p</span>
				<span class='text'>7&lt;/ref&gt; He was especially close to his mother, Lița Baranga, who survived his death</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Deletant, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>0, 257&lt;/ref&gt; His father, an army officer, wanted Ion to follow in his footsteps and thus sent him to attend the Infantry and Cavalry School in [[Craiova]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=d37/&gt; During his childhood, his father divorced his mother to marry a woman who was a Jewish convert to Orthodoxy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ancel pages 463-479&quot;&gt;Ancel, Jean &quot;Antonescu and the Jews&quot; pages 463-479 from ''The Holocaust and History The Known, the Unknown, the Disputed and the Reexamined'' edited by Michael Berenbaum and Abraham Peck, Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1998 page 465</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The breakup of his parents' marriage was a traumatic event for the young Antonescu, and he made no secret of his dislike of his stepmother, whom he always depicted as a ''femme fatale'' who destroyed what he saw as his parents' happy marriage</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ancel pages 463-479&quot;/&gt;According to one account, Ion Antonescu was briefly a classmate of [[Wilhelm Filderman]], the future [[History of the Jews in Romania|Romanian Jewish community]] activist whose interventions with ''Conducător'' Antonescu helped save a number of his coreligionists</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Penkower, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>52–153&lt;/ref&gt; After graduation, in 1904, Antonescu joined the Romanian Army with the rank of Second Lieutenant</span>
				<span class='text'>He spent the following two years attending courses at the Special Cavalry Section in [[Târgoviște]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=d37/&gt; Reportedly, Antonescu was a zealous and goal-setting student, upset by the slow pace of promotions, and compensated for his diminutive stature through toughness</span>

				<span class='text'>html &quot;Serialul 'Ion Antonescu și asumarea istoriei' (1)&quot;], [[BBC]] Romanian edition, August 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In time, the reputation of being a tough and ruthless commander, together with his reddish hair, earned him the nickname ''Câinele Roșu'' (&quot;The Red Dog&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=r1/&gt; Antonescu also developed a reputation for questioning his commanders and for appealing over their heads whenever he felt they were wrong</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=r1/&gt;During the repression of the [[1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt|1907 peasants' revolt]], he headed a cavalry unit in [[Covurlui County]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=d37/&gt;&lt;ref name=r1/&gt; Opinions on his role in the events diverge: while some historians believe Antonescu was a particularly violent participant in quelling the revolt,&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;&lt;ref name=fv301&gt;Veiga, p</span>
				<span class='text'>01&lt;/ref&gt; others equate his participation with that of regular officers&lt;ref name=r1/&gt; or view it as outstandingly tactful</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=d37/&gt; In addition to restricting peasant protests, Antonescu's unit subdued [[Socialism|socialist]] activities in [[Galați]] port</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=fv301/&gt; His handling of the situation earned him praise from [[King of Romania|King]] [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]], who sent Crown Prince (future monarch) [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand]] to congratulate him in front of the whole garrison</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=d37/&gt; The following year, Antonescu was promoted to Lieutenant, and, between 1911 and 1913, he attended the [[Academia de Înalte Studii Militare din București|Advanced War School]], receiving the rank of Captain upon graduation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=d37/&gt; In 1913, during the [[Second Balkan War]] against [[Bulgaria]], Antonescu served as a [[Staff (military)|staff officer]] in the First Cavalry Division in [[Dobruja]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=d37/&gt;===World War I===After 1916, when the [[Kingdom of Romania]] entered [[World War I]] on the [[Allies of World War I|Entente side]], Ion Antonescu acted as [[chief of staff]] for General [[Constantin Prezan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=d37/&gt; In August 1916, upon the start of the [[Romania during World War I|Romanian campaign]], Romanian troops crossed the [[Carpathian Mountains]], marching into the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]]-ruled region of [[Transylvania]], but their effort was halted when the [[Central Powers]] opened new fronts</span>
				<span class='text'>Bulgarian and [[German Empire|Imperial German]] armies decisively defeated their ill-equipped and poorly defended Romanian adversaries in the [[Battle of Turtucaia]] on (August 24) and advanced into Dobruja</span>
				<span class='text'>When enemy troops crossed the mountains from Transylvania into [[Wallachia]], Antonescu was ordered to design a defense plan for Bucharest</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=d37/&gt;The Romanian royal court, army, and administration were subsequently forced to retreat into [[Moldavia]], the last portion of territory still under Romanian control</span>
				<span class='text'>Henceforth, Antonescu took part in an important decision involving defensive efforts, an unusual promotion which probably stoked his ambitions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=r1/&gt; In December, as Prezan became the [[Chief of the Romanian General Staff|Chief of the General Staff]], Antonescu, who was by now a major, was named the head of operations, being involved in the defense of Moldavia</span>
				<span class='text'>He contributed to the tactics used during the [[Battle of Mărășești]] (July–August 1917), when Romanians under General [[Alexandru Averescu]] managed to stop the advance of German forces under the command of Field Marshal [[August von Mackensen]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Deletant, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>7–38&lt;/ref&gt; Antonescu lived in Prezan's proximity for the remainder of the war and influenced his decisions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=d38&gt;Deletant, p</span>
				<span class='text'>8&lt;/ref&gt;That autumn, the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|October Revolution]] in Russia removed Romania's main ally, the [[Russian Provisional Government]], from the conflict</span>
				<span class='text'>Its successor, [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Bolshevik Russia]], made peace with the Central Powers under the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], leaving Romania the only enemy of the Central Powers on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In these conditions, the Romanian government signed, and the [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]] ratified, Romania's own [[Treaty of Bucharest, 1918|peace treaty with the Central Powers]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Romania broke the treaty later in the year, on the grounds that King Ferdinand I had not signed it</span>
				<span class='text'>During the interval, Antonescu, who viewed the [[separate peace]] as &quot;the most rational solution&quot;, was assigned command over a cavalry regiment</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=d38/&gt; The renewed offensive played a part in ensuring the [[union of Transylvania with Romania]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After the war, Antonescu's merits as an operations officer were noticed by, among others, politician [[Ion G</span>
				<span class='text'>Duca]], who wrote that &quot;his [Antonescu's] intelligence, skill and activity, brought credit on himself and invaluable service to the country&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=d38/&gt; Another event occurring late in the war is also credited with having played a major part in Antonescu's life: in 1918, Crown Prince [[Carol II of Romania|Carol]] (the future King Carol II) eloped and technically [[Desertion|deserted]] his army posting, to marry the commoner [[Zizi Lambrino]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=r1/&gt; This outraged Antonescu, who developed enduring contempt for the future king</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=r1/&gt;===Diplomatic assignments and General Staff positions===[[File:AntonescuYCodreanu1935</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|General Antonescu (left) and ''Capitanul'' of the Iron Guard, [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]], at a skiing event in 1935]]Lieutenant Colonel Ion Antonescu retained his visibility in the public eye during the [[interwar period]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He participated in the political campaign to earn recognition at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] of 1919 for Romania's gains in Transylvania</span>
				<span class='text'>His [[Nationalism|nationalist]] argument about a future state of the [[Romanians]] was published as the essay ''Românii</span>
				<span class='text'>Origina&lt;!-- sic --&gt;, trecutul, sacrificiile și drepturile lor'' (&quot;The Romanians</span>
				<span class='text'>Their Origin, Their Past, Their Sacrifices and Their Rights&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>The booklet advocated extension of Romanian rule beyond the confines of [[Greater Romania]], and recommended, at the risk of war with the emerging [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], the annexation of all [[Banat]] areas and the [[Timočka Krajina|Timok Valley]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Haynes, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>13, 115&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1920, Antonescu was one of three people nominated by the new Averescu executive to be a [[military attaché]] of Romania in [[France]], but a report issued by the French military observer in Romania, General [[Victor Pétin]], was negative enough to make the French side choose a certain Colonel Șuțu instead (the text referred to Antonescu as &quot;extremely vain&quot;, &quot;[[Chauvinism|chauvinistic]]&quot; and &quot;[[Xenophobia|xenophobic]]&quot;, while acknowledging his &quot;great military worth&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=d38/&gt; Antonescu was known for his frequent and erratic changes of mood, going from being extremely angry to being calm to angry again to being calm again within minutes, something that often disoriented those who had to work with Antonescu</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ancel pages 463-479&quot;/&gt; The Israeli historian [[Jean Ancel]] wrote that Antonescu's frequent changes of mood were due to the syphilis he contacted as an young man, and which he suffered from for the rest of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ancel pages 463-479&quot;/&gt;Nevertheless, Șuțu had to leave [[Paris]] in 1922, and when the Romanian government nominated Antonescu again, the French government felt obliged to accept his nomination, despite renewed criticism from Pétin's part</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Deletant, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>8–39&lt;/ref&gt; At the moment of his reassignment, Antonescu was handling military instruction in the Transylvanian city of [[Sibiu]], where his rebellious attitude was causing irritation among his commanders</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=d39&gt;Deletant, p</span>
				<span class='text'>9&lt;/ref&gt; From 1923, Antonescu was also the Romanian attaché in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Belgium]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=d39/&gt; After embarking on his mission, he negotiated a credit worth 100 million [[French franc]]s to for Romania to purchase French weaponry, and worked together with Romanian [[League of Nations]] diplomat [[Nicolae Titulescu]]; the two became personal friends</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=d39/&gt; According to one account, he was also in contact with the Romanian-born [[Conservatism|conservative]] aristocrat and writer [[Marthe Bibesco]], who is reported to have introduced Antonescu to the ideas of [[Gustave Le Bon]], a researcher of [[crowd psychology]] who had an influence on [[Fascism|fascist]] leaders</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=jvg186&gt;[[Jaap van Ginneken]], ''Crowds, Psychology, and Politics, 1871–1899'', [[Cambridge University Press]], Cambridge, 1992, p</span>
				<span class='text'>86</span>
				<span class='text'>ISBN 0-521-40418-5&lt;/ref&gt; The same story has it that Bibesco saw the Romanian officer as a new version of 19th century nationalist rebel [[Georges Boulanger]], introducing him as such to Le Bon</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=jvg186/&gt; In 1923, he made the acquaintance of lawyer [[Mihai Antonescu]], who was to become his close friend, legal representative and political associate</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Deletant, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>01–302&lt;/ref&gt;After returning to Romania in 1926, Antonescu returned to his teaching position in Sibiu, and, in autumn 1928, was Secretary-General of the [[Ministry of National Defense (Romania)|Defense Ministry]] in the [[Vintilă Brătianu]] cabinet</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=d39/&gt; He married [[Maria Antonescu|Maria Niculescu]], for long a resident of France, who had been married twice before: to a [[Romanian Police]] officer, with whom she had a son, Gheorghe (died 1944), and to a Frenchman of Jewish origin</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Deletant, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>9, 45, 290&lt;/ref&gt; After a period as Deputy Chief of the General Staff,&lt;ref name=d39/&gt; he was appointed its Chief (1933–1934)</span>
				<span class='text'>These assignments coincided with the rule of Carol's underage son [[Michael I of Romania|Michael I]] and his [[regent]]s, and with Carol's seizure of power in 1930</span>
				<span class='text'>During this period Antonescu first grew interested in the [[Iron Guard]], an [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] and fascist-related movement headed by [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In his capacity as Deputy Chief of Staff, he ordered the Army's intelligence unit to compile a report on the faction, and made a series of critical notes on Codreanu's various statements</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=d39/&gt;As Chief of Staff, Antonescu reportedly had his first confrontation with the political class and the monarch</span>
				<span class='text'>His projects for weapon modernization were questioned by Defense Minister [[Paul Angelescu]], leading Antonescu to present his resignation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=d39/&gt; According to another account, he completed an official report on the [[embezzlement]] of Army funds, which indirectly implicated Carol and his ''[[camarilla]]'' (''see [[Škoda Affair]]'')</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=r1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Veiga, p</span>
				<span class='text'>81&lt;/ref&gt; The king consequently ordered him out of office, provoking indignation among sections of the political mainstream</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=r1/&gt; On Carol's orders, Antonescu was placed under surveillance by the ''[[Siguranța Statului]]'' intelligence service, and closely monitored by the [[Ministry of Administration and Interior (Romania)|Interior Ministry]] Undersecretary [[Armand Călinescu]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=d40&gt;Deletant, p</span>
				<span class='text'>0&lt;/ref&gt; The officer's political credentials were on the rise, and he had contacts with all sides of the political spectrum, while support for Carol plummeted</span>
				<span class='text'>Antonescu maintained contacts with the two main democratic groups, the [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal]] and the [[National Peasants' Party|National Peasants']] parties (known respectively as PNL and PNȚ)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=r1/&gt; He was also engaged in discussions with the rising [[far right]], antisemitic and fascist movements: although in competition with each other, both the [[National Christian Party]] (PNC) of [[Octavian Goga]] and the Iron Guard sought to attract Antonescu to their side</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=r1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deletant, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>4, 40–41; Veiga, p</span>
				<span class='text'>81&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, to the authorities' alarm, Army General and Iron Guard member [[Gheorghe Cantacuzino-Grănicerul]] arranged a meeting between Ion Antonescu and the movement's leader: Antonescu is reported to have found Codreanu arrogant, but to have welcomed his revolutionizing approach to politics</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=d40/&gt;===Defense portfolio and the Codreanu trials===In late 1937, after the [[Romanian general election, 1937|December general election]] came to an inconclusive result, Carol appointed Goga [[Prime Minister of Romania|Prime Minister]] over a far right cabinet that was the first executive to impose [[racial discrimination]] in its treatment of the [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish community]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Goga's appointment was meant to curb the rise of the more popular and even more radical Codreanu</span>
				<span class='text'>Initially given the [[Ministry of Communications and Information Society (Romania)|Communications portfolio]] by his rival, Interior Minister [[Armand Călinescu]], Antonescu repeatedly demanded the office of Defense Minister, which he was eventually granted</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Deletant, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>0–41&lt;/ref&gt; His mandate coincided with a troubled period, and saw Romania having to choose between its traditional alliance with France, Britain, the crumbling [[Little Entente]] and the League of Nations or moving closer to [[Nazi Germany]] and its [[Anti-Comintern Pact]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Antonescu's own contribution is disputed by historians, who variously see him as either a supporter of the Anglo-French alliance or, like the PNC itself, more favorable to cooperation with [[Adolf Hitler]]'s Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=r1/&gt; At the time, Antonescu viewed Romania's alliance with the Entente as insurance against Hungarian and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[revanchism]], but, as an [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]], he was suspicious of the [[Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance|Franco-Soviet rapprochement]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Veiga, p</span>
				<span class='text'>81, 296&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly concerned about Hungarian demands in Transylvania, he ordered the General Staff to prepare for a western attack</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Deletant, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>2–43&lt;/ref&gt; However, his major contribution in office was in relation to an internal crisis: as a response to violent clashes between the Iron Guard and the PNC's own fascist militia, the ''[[Lăncieri]]'', Antonescu extended the already imposed [[martial law]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Deletant, p</span>
				<span class='text'>1&lt;/ref&gt;The Goga cabinet ended when the tentative rapprochement between Goga and Codreanu&lt;ref&gt;''Final Report'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>3; Deletant, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>4, 42; Veiga, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>46–247&lt;/ref&gt; prompted Carol to overthrow the democratic system and proclaim his own authoritarian regime (''see [[1938 Constitution of Romania]], [[National Renaissance Front]]'')</span>
				<span class='text'>The deposed Premier died in 1938, and Antonescu remained a close friend of his widow, [[Veturia Goga]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=d70&gt;Deletant, p</span>
				<span class='text'>0&lt;/ref&gt; By that time, revising his earlier stance, Antonescu had also built a close relationship with Codreanu, and was even said to have become his confidant</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1940, two of Romania's regions, Bessarabia and [[Northern Bukovina]], were lost to a [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|Soviet occupation]] consented to by the king</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Deletant, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>5–46&lt;/ref&gt; Angered by the territorial losses of 1940, General Antonescu sent Carol a general note of protest, and, as a result, was arrested and interned at [[Bistrița Monastery]]</span>

				<span class='text'>The latter grant caused consternation among large sections of Romania's population, causing Carol's popularity to fall to a record low and provoking large-scale protests in Bucharest, the capital</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=r1/&gt; The regime of King Carol had been notorious for been the most corrupt regime in Europe during the 1930s, and when Carol fled Romania, he took with him the better part of the Romanian treasury, leaving the new government with enormous financial problems</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Antonescu had expected-perhaps naively-that Carol would take with him enough money to provide for a comfortable exile, and was surprised that Carol had cleared out almost the entire national treasury</span>
				<span class='text'>For the next four years, a major concern of Antonescu's government was attempting to have the Swiss banks where Carol had slashed much of the loot to return the money to Romania; this effort did not meet with success</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Crampton, Richard pages 117-118&quot;/&gt; Horia Sima's subsequent cooperation with Antonescu was endorsed by high-ranking Nazi German officials, many of whom feared the Iron Guard was too weak to rule on its own</span>

				<span class='text'>1–63, 75–76, 304; ''Final Report'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>3–64&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, Romania's relationship with the United Kingdom (at the time the only major adversary of Nazi Germany) aggravated into conflict: on February 10, 1941, [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Premier]] [[Winston Churchill]] recalled [[List of diplomats from the United Kingdom to Romania|His Majesty's Ambassador]] [[Reginald Hoare]], and approved the [[blockade]] of Romanian ships in British-controlled ports</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Deletant, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>6–27, 75&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 June 1941 during another summit with Hitler, Antonescu first learned of the &quot;special&quot; nature of Operation Barbarossa, namely that the war against the Soviet Union was to be an ideological war to &quot;annihilate&quot; the forces of &quot;Judo-Bolshevism&quot;, a &quot;war of extermination&quot; to be fought without any mercy and Hitler even showed Antonescu a copy of the &quot;Guidelines for the Conduct of the Troops in Russia&quot; he had issued to his forces about the &quot;special treatment&quot; to be handed out to Soviet Jews</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Antonescu completely accepted Hitler's ideas about Operation Barbarossa as a &quot;race war&quot; between the Aryans represented by the Nordic Germans and Latin Romanians on the Axis side vs</span>
				<span class='text'>the Slavs and Asians commanded by the Jews on the Soviet side</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ancel, Jean page 325&quot;&gt;Ancel, Jean ''The History of the Holocaust in Romania'', Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2011  page 325&lt;/ref&gt; During his summit with Hitler in June 1941, Antonescu told the ''Führer'' that he believed it was necessary to &quot;once and for all&quot; eliminate Russia as a power because the Russians was the most powerful Slavic nation and that as a Latin people, the Romanians had an inborn hatred of all Slavs and Jews</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ancel, Jean page 325&quot;/&gt; Antonescu went on to tell Hitler: &quot;Because of its racial qualities, Romania can continue to play its role as an anti-Slavic buffer for the benefit of Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ancel, Jean page 325&quot;/&gt; Ancel wrote that Romanian anti-Slavic racism differed from the German variety in that the Romanians had traditionally feared the Slavic peoples whereas the Germans had traditionally held the Slavic peoples in contempt</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ancel, Jean ''The History of the Holocaust in Romania'', Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2011  page 326&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the Romanians assigned to Barbarossa were to learn that as a Latin people, the Germans considered them to be their inferiors, albeit not as inferior as the Slavs, Asians and Jews who were viewed as ''untermensch'' (&quot;sub-humans&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ancel, Jean pages 325-326&quot;/&gt; Hitler's promise to Antonescu that after the war, the Germanic and Latin races would rule the world in a partnership turned out to be meaningless</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ancel, Jean page 325&quot;/&gt;In June of that year, Romania joined the attack on the Soviet Union, led by Germany in coalition with Hungary, [[Finland]], the [[Slovak Republic (1939–1945)|State of Slovakia]], the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] and the [[Independent State of Croatia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Antonescu had been made aware of the plan by German envoys, and supported it enthusiastically even before Hitler extended Romania an offer to participate</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Deletant, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>8–80, 83&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 June 1941, Antonescu gave orders to his generals about &quot;cleansing the ground&quot; of Jews when Romanian forces entered Bessarabia and Bukovina</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Right from the start, Antonescu proclaimed the war against the Soviet Union to be a &quot;holy war&quot;, a &quot;crusade&quot; in the name of Eastern Orthodox faith and the Romanian race against the forces of &quot;Judo-Bolshevism&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ancel, Jean ''The History of the Holocaust in Romania'', Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2011  page 436</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The propaganda of the Antonescu regime demonized everything Jewish as Antonescu believed that Communism was invented by the Jews, and all of the Soviet leaders were really Jews</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Antonescu made it clear that his regime rejected the moral principles of the &quot;demo-liberal world&quot; and he saw the war as an ideological struggle between his spiritually pure &quot;national-totalitarian regime&quot; vs</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; Despite his quarrel with Sima, much of Antonescu's speech clearly reflected the influence of the ideas of the Iron Guard that Antonescu had absorbed in the 1930s</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; Antonescu's anti-Semitism and sexism went so far that he tacitly condoned the rape of Jewish women and girls in Bessarabia and northern Bukovinia by his forces under the grounds that he was going take away all of the property that the Jews had &quot;stolen&quot; from the Romanians, and as far he was concerned, Jewish females were just another piece of property</span>

				<span class='text'>7–88; Trașcă, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>85–387&lt;/ref&gt; Antonescu's popularity again rose in October, when the fall of Odessa was celebrated triumphantly with a parade through Bucharest's ''[[Arcul de Triumf]]'', and when many Romanians reportedly believed the war was as good as won</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=r2/&gt; In Odessa itself, the aftermath included a [[1941 Odessa massacre|large-scale massacre]] of the Jewish population, ordered by the Marshal as retaliation for a bombing which killed a number of Romanian officers and soldiers (General [[Ioan Glogojeanu]] among them)</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Antonescu planned on attacking Hungary to recover Transylvania at the first opportunity and regarded Romanian involvement on the Eastern Front in part as a way of proving to Hitler that Romania was a better German ally than Hungary, and thus deserving of German support when the planned Romanian-Hungarian war began</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=r3/&gt; The Romanian force engaged in the war reportedly exceeded German demands</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Nicholls, p</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt; As a sign of his satisfaction, Hitler presented his Romanian counterpart with a luxury car</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=r3/&gt; On December 7, 1941, after reflecting on the possibility for Romania, Hungary and Finland to change their stance, the British government responded to repeated Soviet requests and declared war on all three countries</span>

				<span class='text'>0–92&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[Japan]]'s [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] and in compliance with its Axis commitment, Romania declared war on the [[United States]] within five days</span>

				<span class='text'>2&lt;/ref&gt;A crucial change in the war came with the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in June 1942 – February 1943, a major defeat for the Axis</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Romanian Armies in the Battle of Stalingrad|Romania's armies]] alone lost some 150,000 men (either dead, wounded or captured)&lt;ref name=r3/&gt; and more than half of the country's divisions were wiped out</span>

				<span class='text'>61&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of two entire Romanian armies who all either killed or captured by the Soviets produced a major crisis in German-Romanian relations in the winter of 1943 with many people in the Romanian government for the first time questioning the wisdom of fighting on the side of the Axis</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Weinberg, Gerhard pages 460-461&quot;&gt;Weinberg, Gerhard ''A World At Arms'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 pages 460-461</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Outside of the elites, by 1943 the continuing heavy losses on the Eastern Front, anger at the contempt which the Wehrmacht treated their Romanian allies and declining living standards within Romania made the war unpopular with the Romanian people, and consequently the ''Conducător'' himself</span>
				<span class='text'>The American historian [[Gerhard Weinberg]] wrote that: &quot;The string of broken German promises of equipment and support, the disregard of warnings about Soviet offensive preparations, the unfriendly treatment of retreating Romanian units by German officers and soldiers and the general German tendency to blame their own miscalculations and disasters on their allies all combined to produce a real crisis in German-Romanian relations</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Weinberg, Gerhard pages 460-461&quot;/&gt; For part of that interval, the Marshal had withdrawn from public life, owing to an unknown affliction, which is variously rumored to have been a [[mental breakdown]], a [[foodborne illness]] or a symptom of the [[syphilis]] he had contracted earlier in life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Deletant, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>09–210, 335&lt;/ref&gt; He is known to have been suffering from digestive problems, treating himself with food prepared by Marlene von Exner, an [[Austria]]n-born [[dietitian]] who moved into [[Adolf Hitler's vegetarianism|Hitler's service]] after 1943</span>

				<span class='text'>ISBN 85-00-01682-5&lt;/ref&gt;Upon his return, Antonescu blamed the Romanian losses on German overseer [[Arthur Hauffe]], whom Hitler agreed to replace</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Deletant, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>8–99&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel with the military losses, Romania was confronted with large-scale economic problems</span>
				<span class='text'>Romania's oil was the ''Reich'''s only source of natural oil after the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 to August 1944 (Germany also had synthetic oil plants operating from 1942 onwards), and as such for economic reasons, Romania was always treated as a major ally by Hitler</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Deletant, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>6–27&lt;/ref&gt; A recurring problem for Antonescu was attempting to obtain payments for all of the oil he shipped to Germany while resisting German demands for increased oil production</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Weinberg, Gerhard page 521&quot;/&gt; The situation was further aggravated in 1942, as [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] and [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] were able to bomb the oil fields in [[Prahova County]] (''see [[Bombing of Romania in World War II]], [[Operation Tidal Wave]]'')</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Deletant, pp</span>

				<span class='text'>80–382&lt;/ref&gt; American political scientist [[Charles King (professor of international affairs)|Charles King]] writes: &quot;There was never any attempt to annex the occupied territory [of Transnistria], for it was generally considered by the Romanian government to be a temporary [[buffer zone]] between Greater Romania and the Soviet front line</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;King, p</span>
				<span class='text'>3&lt;/ref&gt; At his 1946 trial, Antonescu claimed that Transnistria had been occupied to prevent Romania being caught in a &quot;pincer&quot; between Germany's ''[[Drang nach Osten]]'' and the ''[[Volksdeutsche|Volksdeutsch]]'' communities to the east, while denying charges of having exploited the region for Romania's benefit</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Deletant, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>53–254&lt;/ref&gt;Romanian historian [[Lucian Boia]] believes that Ion Antonescu may have nevertheless had [[Expansionism|expansionist]] goals to the east, and that he implicitly understood [[Operation Barbarossa]] as a tool for containing [[Slavic peoples]]</span>

				<span class='text'>46–247, 248, 322–323&lt;/ref&gt; His earliest thoughts on Codreanu's ideology criticize the Legionary leader for advocating &quot;brutal measures&quot; in dealing with the &quot;invasion of Jews&quot;, and instead propose &quot;the organization of Romanian classes&quot; as a method for reaching the same objective</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=d39/&gt; Politician [[Aureliu Weiss]], who met General Antonescu during that interval, recalled that, although antisemitic &quot;to the core&quot;, he was capable of restraint in public</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=fr243&gt;''Final Report'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>43&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Mihail Ionescu]], the ''Conducător'' was not averse to the Iron Guard's &quot;Legionary principles&quot;, but wanted antisemitism to be &quot;applied in an orderly fashion&quot;, as opposed to [[Horia Sima]]'s revolutionary ways</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=r1/&gt; Historian [[Ioan Scurtu]] believes that, during the [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom|Legionary Rebellion]], Antonescu deliberately waited before stepping in, in order for the Guard to be &quot;profoundly discredited&quot; and for himself to be perceived as a &quot;savior&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=r1/&gt; In April 1941, he let his ministers know that he was considering letting &quot;the mob&quot; deal with the Jews, &quot;and after the slaughter, I will restore order</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=fr243/&gt; Lucian Boia notes that the Romanian leader was indeed motivated by antisemitic beliefs, but that these need to be contextualized in order to understand what separates Antonescu from Hitler in terms of radicalism</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Boia, p</span>
				<span class='text'>60&lt;/ref&gt; However, various other researchers assess that, by aligning himself with Hitler before and during [[Operation Barbarossa]], Antonescu implicitly agreed with his thoughts on the &quot;[[Jewish Question]]&quot;, choosing [[Racial antisemitism|racial]] over [[religious antisemitism]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kelso, p</span>
				<span class='text'>8&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so, Antonescu offered some credit to a marginal and [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] trend in Romanian sociology, which, basing itself on [[Eugenics|eugenic]] theories, recommended the marginalization, deportation or [[compulsory sterilization]] of the Romani people, whose numeric presence it usually exaggerated</span>

				<span class='text'>ISBN 0-631-20933-6&lt;/ref&gt; For Schulze, the defining elements of such governments is the presence of a &quot;[[The Establishment|conservative establishment]]&quot; which ensured &quot;social stability&quot; by extending the control of a &quot;traditional state&quot; (thus effectively blocking &quot;revolutionary suggestions&quot; from the [[far left]] and the [[far right]] alike)</span>

				<span class='text'>[[Routledge]]'s 2002 ''Companion to Fascism and the Far Right'' uses the terms &quot;para-fascist&quot; to define Antonescu, adding: &quot;generally regarded as an authoritarian conservative [Antonescu] incorporated fascism into his regime, in the shape of the Iron Guard, rather than embodying fascism himself</span>

				<span class='text'>18–120, 276&lt;/ref&gt;The policies applied in respect to the Romani population were ambivalent: while ordering the deportation of those he considered criminals, Ion Antonescu was taking some interest in improving the lives of Romani laborers of the [[Bărăgan Plain]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The principle reasons for his change of mind were signs of disapproval from court circles, an warning from the American government passed on by the Swiss ambassador that he would prosecuted for war crimes and crimes against humanity after the Allies had won if the deportation went ahead, and most importantly because Hitler would not undo the Second Vienna Award and return northern Transylvania to Romania</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Antonescu saw the deportation of the Jews of the ''Regat'' as the ''pro quid quo'' for the return of Transylvania and unable to obtain satisfactory promises from the German Ambassador Baron [[Manfred Freiherr von Killinger|Manfred von Killinger]] that Romania would be rewarded with the return of Transylvania in exchange for handing over its Jews, Antonescu cancelled the deportation until the Germans would make him a better offer</span>

				<span class='text'>According to Gledhill and King: &quot;Romanian liberals had been critical of their government's warm relationship with Hitler, which had been developing throughout the 1930s, but the [1940] Soviet attack on Romanian territory left them with little chance but to support Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union</span>

				<span class='text'>35&lt;/ref&gt; One such early example was [[Iuliu Maniu]], by then one of the country's prominent [[Anti-communism|anti-communists]], who was accused of being a fascist and an Antonescu sympathizer, mainly for having shaken his hand during the trial</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=r3/&gt; The enlistment of [[Germans of Romania|ethnic Germans]] into Nazi German units, as approved by Antonescu, was used as a pretext for a Soviet-led [[Expulsion of Germans from Romania after World War II|expulsion of Germans from Romania]]</span>

				<span class='text'>73&lt;/ref&gt; As part of its deteriorating relationship with [[Roman Catholicism in Romania|Romanian Roman Catholics]], and urged on by the Soviets, the communist cabinet of [[Petru Groza]] also deemed [[Apostolic Nuncio]] [[Andrea Cassulo]] a collaborator of Antonescu and a ''[[persona non grata]]'', based on transcripts of the Cassulo-Antonescu conversations</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kent, pp</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=k224/&gt;Nevertheless, Romanian-born Holocaust historian [[Radu Ioanid]] notes, few Romanians involved in organizing the Holocaust were prosecuted, and, of those, none were executed after the Antonescu trial</span>
				<span class='text'>He attributes this to nationalist resistance within the administrative and judicial apparatus, to communist fears of alienating a too large number of people, to the emigration of [[Zionism|Zionist]] survivors, and to the open hostility of some communists toward liberal Jewish community leaders</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ioanid, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>35–236&lt;/ref&gt; Jews also faced conflict with the new authorities and with the majority population, as described by other researchers</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; There were, nonetheless, sporadic trials for Holocaust-related crimes, including one of [[Maria Antonescu]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Arrested in September 1944 and held 1945–1946 in Soviet custody, she was re-arrested at home in 1950, tried and ultimately found guilty of economic crimes for her collaboration with the [[Central Jewish Office (Romania)|Central Jewish Office]]</span>
