				<span class='text'>]Jack Kerouac was born on March 12, 1922 in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], to [[French Canadian]] parents, Léo-Alcide Kéroack and Gabrielle-Ange Lévesque, of [[Saint-Hubert-de-Rivière-du-Loup, Quebec|St-Hubert-de-Rivière-du-Loup]] in the province of [[Québec]], Canada</span>
				<span class='text'>There is some confusion surrounding his name, partly because of variations on the spelling of Kerouac, and because of Kerouac's own statement of his name as Jean-Louis Lebris de Kerouac</span>
				<span class='text'>His reason for that statement seems to be linked to an old family legend that the Kerouacs had descended from Baron François Louis Alexandre Lebris de Kerouac</span>
				<span class='text'>Kerouac's baptism certificate lists his name simply as Jean Louis Kirouac, and this is the most common spelling of the name in Quebec</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1983&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Nicosia|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that Kerouac's roots were indeed in [[Brittany]], and he was descended from a middle-class merchant colonist, Urbain-François Le Bihan, Sieur de [[Lanmeur|Kervoac]], whose sons married French Canadians</span>

				<span class='text'>Kerouac's method was heavily influenced by the prolific explosion of[[Jazz]], especially the [[Bebop]] genre established by [[Charlie Parker]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Thelonious Monk]], and others</span>
				<span class='text'>Later, Kerouac included ideas he developed from his [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] studies that began with [[Gary Snyder]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He often referred to his style as ''spontaneous prose''{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Kerouac’s prose was spontaneous and purportedly without edits, he primarily wrote [[autobiographical novel]]s (or [[Roman à clef]]) based upon actual events from his life and the people with whom he interacted</span>
				<span class='text'>[Image:TheAirWasSoftTheStarsSoFineThePromiseOfEveryCobbledAlleySoGreatByJackKerouacInJackKerouacAlley</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|''On the Road'' excerpt in the center of [[Jack Kerouac Alley]] ]]Many of his books exemplified this spontaneous approach, including  ''On the Road'' (which was written as a stream of consciousness), ''Visions of Cody'', ''Visions of Gerard'', ''Big Sur'', and ''The Subterraneans''</span>
				<span class='text'>The central features of this writing method were the ideas of breath (borrowed from Jazz and from Buddhist meditation breathing), improvising words over the inherent structures of mind and language, and not editing a single word (much of his work was edited by Donald Merriam Allen, a major figure in Beat Generation poetry who edited some of Ginsberg's work as well)</span>
				<span class='text'>Connected with his idea of breath was the elimination of the [[Full stop|period]], preferring to use a long, connecting dash instead</span>
				<span class='text'>As such, the phrases occurring between dashes might resemble [[improvisation|improvisational jazz]] licks</span>
				<span class='text'>When spoken, the words might take on a certain kind of rhythm, though none of it pre-meditated</span>
				<span class='text'>erouac greatly admired Snyder, many of whose ideas influenced him</span>
				<span class='text'> ''[[The Dharma Bums]]'' contains accounts of a mountain climbing trip Kerouac took with Snyder, and also whole paragraphs from letters Snyder had written to Kerouac</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Suiter| 2002|p=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While living with Snyder outside [[Mill Valley, California]] in 1956, Kerouac worked on a book about him, which he considered calling ''Visions of Gary''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Suiter| 2002|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (This eventually became ''Dharma Bums'', which Kerouac described as &quot;mostly about [Snyder]</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Suiter| 2002|p=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That summer, Kerouac took a job as a [[fire lookout]] on [[Desolation Peak (Washington)|Desolation Peak]] in the [[North Cascades]] in Washington, after hearing Snyder's and Whalen's accounts of their own lookout stints</span>
				<span class='text'>Kerouac described the experience in his novel ''Desolation Angels''</span>
				<span class='text'>e would go on for hours, often drunk, to friends and strangers about his method</span>
				<span class='text'> Allen Ginsberg, initially unimpressed,  would later be one of its great proponents, and indeed, he was apparently influenced by Kerouac's free-flowing prose method of writing in the composition of his masterpiece &quot;[[Howl]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>It was at about the time that Kerouac wrote ''The Subterraneans'' that he was approached by Ginsberg and others to formally explicate his style</span>
				<span class='text'>Among the writings he set down specifically about his Spontaneous Prose method, the most concise would be ''Belief and Technique for Modern Prose'', a list of 30 &quot;essentials&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{Quote box|width=45%|align=right|fontsize=12|quote=The only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn, like fabulous yellow Roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars, and in the middle, you see the blue center-light pop, and everybody goes ahh</span>

				<span class='text'>source=''[[On the Road]]''|quoted=1}}Some believed that at times Kerouac's writing technique did not produce lively or energetic prose</span>

				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}Although the body of Kerouac's work has been published in English, recent research has suggested that, aside from already known correspondence and letters written to friends and family, he also wrote unpublished works of fiction in French</span>
				<span class='text'> A manuscript entitled ''Sur le Chemin'' (''On the Road'') was discovered in 2008 by Québécois journalist Gabriel Anctil</span>

				<span class='text'>tml |publisher=''Le Devoir'' |date=September 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novella, completed in five days in Mexico during December 1952, is a telling example of Kerouac's attempts at writing in [[Joual]],&lt;ref group=note&gt;He refers to it in a letter addressed to Neil Cassady (who is commonly known as his inspiration for the character of Dean Moriarty) written on January 10, 1953</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; a dialect typical of the French Canadian working class of the time</span>
				<span class='text'>It can be summarized as a form of expression utilizing both old [[patois]] and modern French mixed with modern English words (''windshield'' being a modern English expression used casually by some French Canadians even today)</span>
				<span class='text'> Set in 1935, mostly on the American east coast, the short manuscript (50 pages) explores some of the recurring themes of Kerouac's literature by way of a narrative very close to, if not identical to, the spoken word</span>
				<span class='text'> It tells the story of a group of men who agree to meet in New York, including a 13-year-old Kerouac refers to as &quot;Ti-Jean&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'> Ti-Jean and his father Leo (Kerouac's father's real name) leave Boston by car, traveling to assist friends looking for a place to stay in the city</span>
				<span class='text'> The story actually follows two cars and their passengers, one driving out of Denver and the other from Boston, until they eventually meet in a dingy bar in New York's Chinatown</span>
				<span class='text'>In it, Kerouac's &quot;French&quot; is written in a form  which has little regard for grammar or spelling,  relying often on phonetics in order to render an authentic reproduction of his French-Canadian vernacular</span>
				<span class='text'>The novel starts: ''Dans l'mois d'Octobre 1935, y'arriva une machine du West, de Denver, sur le chemin pour New York</span>

				<span class='text'>''Sur le Chemin'' is Kerouac's second known French manuscript, the first being ''La nuit est ma Femme'' written in early 1951 and completed a few days before he began the original English version of ''On the Road'', as revealed by journalist Gabriel Anctil in the Montreal daily ''[[Le Devoir]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Suiter| 2002|p=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, he began an intensive study of this sutra, in a repeating weekly cycle, devoting one day to each of the six [[Pāramitā]]s, and the seventh to the concluding passage on  [[Samādhi]]</span>
				<span class='text'> This was his sole reading on Desolation Peak, and he hoped by this means to condition his mind to  [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]], and possibly to have a vision</span>

				<span class='text'>rg |date= |accessdate=2013-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Kerouac's poems follow the style of his free-flowing, uninhibited prose, also incorporating elements of jazz and Buddhism</span>
				<span class='text'> &quot;Mexico City Blues,&quot; a collection of poems published in 1959, is made up of 242 choruses following the rhythms of jazz</span>
				<span class='text'>In much of his poetry, to achieve a jazz-like rhythm, Kerouac made use of the long dash in place of a period</span>
				<span class='text'>Several examples of this can be seen in &quot;Mexico City Blues&quot;:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;EverythingIs Ignorant of its own emptiness—AngerDoesnt like to be reminded of fits—(fragment from 113th Chorus)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kerouac |first=Jack |date=1959 |title=Mexico City Blues (242 Choruses) |url= |location= |publisher=Grove Press |page=113 |isbn= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Other well-known poems by Kerouac, such as &quot;Bowery Blues,&quot; incorporate jazz rhythms with Buddhist themes of [[Saṃsāra]], the cycle of life and death, and [[Samadhi]], the concentration of composing the mind</span>
