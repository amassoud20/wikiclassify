				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Henrik Ibsen]] and [[August Strindberg]], Chekhov is often referred to as one of the three seminal figures in the birth of early modernism in the theater</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Harold Bloom, ''Genius: A Study of One Hundred Exemplary Authors''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Chekhov renounced the theatre after the disastrous reception of ''[[The Seagull]]'' in 1896, but the play was revived to acclaim in 1898 by [[Constantin Stanislavski]]'s [[Moscow Art Theatre]], which subsequently also produced Chekhov's ''[[Uncle Vanya]]'' and premiered his last two plays, ''[[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]]'' and ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>These four works present a challenge to the acting ensemble&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Actors climb up Chekhov like a mountain, roped together, sharing the glory if they ever make it to the summit&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Actor [[Ian McKellen]], quoted in Miles, 9</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; as well as to audiences, because in place of conventional action Chekhov offers a &quot;theatre of mood&quot; and a &quot;submerged life in the text&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;&quot;Chekhov's art demands a theatre of mood</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]], quoted in Allen, 13; &quot;A richer submerged life in the text is characteristic of a more profound drama of realism, one which depends less on the externals of presentation</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Styan, 84</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Chekhov had at first written stories only for financial gain, but as his artistic ambition grew, he made formal innovations which have influenced the evolution of the modern short story</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;&quot;Chekhov is said to be the father of the modern short story&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He made no apologies for the difficulties this posed to readers, insisting that the role of an artist was to ask questions, not to answer them</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;&quot;You are right in demanding that an artist should take an intelligent attitude to his work, but you confuse two things: solving a problem and stating a problem correctly</span>
				<span class='text'>It is only the second that is obligatory for the artist</span>

				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt; On his return, he began the novella-length short story &quot;[[s:The Steppe|The Steppe]],&quot; which he called &quot;something rather odd and much too original,&quot; and which was eventually published in ''[[Severny Vestnik]]'' (''The Northern Herald'')</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Letter to Grigorovich, 12 January 1888</span>
				<span class='text'>Quoted by Malcolm, 137</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In a narrative that drifts with the thought processes of the characters, Chekhov evokes a [[chaise]] journey across the steppe through the eyes of a young boy sent to live away from home, and his companions, a priest and a merchant</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;The Steppe&quot; has been called a &quot;dictionary of Chekhov's poetics&quot;, and it represented a significant advance for Chekhov, exhibiting much of the quality of his mature fiction and winning him publication in a literary journal rather than a newspaper</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;&quot;'The Steppe,' as Michael Finke suggests, is 'a sort of dictionary of Chekhov's poetics,' a kind of sample case of the concealed literary weapons Chekhov would deploy in his work to come</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Malcolm, 147</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In autumn 1887, a theatre manager named Korsh commissioned Chekhov to write a play, the result being ''[[Ivanov (play)|Ivanov]]'', written in a fortnight and produced that November</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;From the biographical sketch, adapted from a memoir by Chekhov's brother Mikhail, which prefaces [[Constance Garnett]]'s translation of Chekhov's letters, 1920</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Though Chekhov found the experience &quot;sickening&quot; and painted a comic portrait of the chaotic production in a letter to his brother Alexander, the play was a hit and was praised, to Chekhov's bemusement, as a work of originality</span>

				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt; Although Chekhov did not fully realize it at the time, Chekhov's plays, such as &quot;The Seagull&quot; (written in 1895), &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; (written in 1897), &quot;The Three Sisters&quot; (written in 1900), and &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; (written in 1903) served as a revolutionary backbone to what is common sense to the medium of acting to this day: an effort to recreate and express the &quot;realism&quot; of how people truly act and speak with each other and translating it to the stage in order to manifest the human condition as accurately as possible in hopes to make the audience reflect upon their own definition of what it means to be human, warts and all</span>
				<span class='text'>This philosophy of approaching the art of acting has stood not only steadfast, but as the cornerstone of acting for much of the 20th century to this day</span>

				<span class='text'>As well as organising relief for victims of the [[famine]] and [[cholera]] outbreaks of 1892, he went on to build three schools, a fire station, and a clinic, and to donate his medical services to peasants for miles around, despite frequent recurrences of his tuberculosis</span>

				<span class='text'>In the two years since he had moved to the estate, he had refurbished the house, taken up agriculture and horticulture, tended the orchard and the pond, and planted many trees, which, according to Mikhail, he &quot;looked after&amp;nbsp;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Rayfield, 394–8</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; But the play so impressed the theatre director [[Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko]] that he convinced his colleague [[Constantin Stanislavski]] to direct a new production for the innovative [[Moscow Art Theatre]] in 1898</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;Ben&quot;&gt;Benedetti, ''Stanislavski: An Introduction'', 25</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Chekhov and the Art Theatre, in Stanislavski's words, were united in a common desire &quot;to achieve artistic simplicity and truth on the stage</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Allen, 11</span>

				<span class='text'>Rayfield draws from his critical study ''Chekhov's &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; and the &quot;Wood Demon&quot;'' (1995), which anatomised the evolution of the ''Wood Demon'' into ''Uncle Vanya''—&quot;one of Chekhov's most furtive achievements</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt;===Yalta===In March 1897, Chekhov suffered a major hemorrhage of the lungs while on a visit to Moscow</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1902, Olga suffered a miscarriage; and [[Donald Rayfield]] has offered evidence, based on the couple's letters, that conception may have occurred when Chekhov and Olga were apart, although Russian scholars have rejected that claim</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The literary legacy of this long-distance marriage is a correspondence that preserves gems of theatre history, including shared complaints about Stanislavski's directing methods and Chekhov's advice to Olga about performing in his plays</span>

				<span class='text'>The ovations for the play ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]'' in the year of his death served to demonstrate the Russian public's acclaim for the writer, which placed him second in literary celebrity only to [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]], who outlived him by six years</span>
				<span class='text'>Tolstoy was an early admirer of Chekhov's short stories and had a series that he deemed &quot;first quality&quot; and &quot;second quality&quot; bound into a book</span>
				<span class='text'>In the first category were: &quot;Children&quot;, &quot;The Chorus Girl&quot;, &quot;A Play&quot;, &quot;Home&quot;, &quot;Misery&quot;, &quot;The Runaway&quot;, &quot;In Court&quot;, &quot;Vanka&quot;, &quot;Ladies&quot;, &quot;The Malefactors&quot;, &quot;The Boys&quot;, &quot;Darkness&quot;, &quot;Sleepy&quot;, &quot;The Helpmate&quot;, and &quot;[[The Darling (Chekhov)|The Darling]]&quot;; in the second: &quot;A Transgression&quot;, &quot;Sorrow&quot;, &quot;The Witch&quot;, &quot;Verochka&quot;, &quot;In a Strange Land&quot;, &quot;The Cook's Wedding&quot;, &quot;A Tedious Business&quot;, &quot;An Upheaval&quot;, &quot;Oh!

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In Russia itself, Chekhov's drama fell out of fashion after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|revolution]], but it was later incorporated into the Soviet canon</span>
				<span class='text'>The character of Lopakhin, for example, was reinvented as a hero of the new order, rising from a modest background to eventually possess the gentry's estates</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;One of the first non-Russians to praise Chekhov's plays was [[George Bernard Shaw]], who subtitled his ''Heartbreak House'' &quot;A Fantasia in the Russian Manner on English Themes,&quot; and pointed out similarities between the predicament of the British landed class and that of their Russian counterparts as depicted by Chekhov: &quot;the same nice people, the same utter futility</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Anna Obraztsova in &quot;Bernard Shaw's Dialogue with Chekhov&quot;, from Miles, 43–4</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In the United States, Chekhov's reputation began its rise slightly later, partly through the influence of [[Stanislavski's system]] of acting, with its notion of [[subtext]]: &quot;Chekhov often expressed his thought not in speeches,&quot; wrote Stanislavski, &quot;but in pauses or between the lines or in replies consisting of a single word&amp;nbsp;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Eßlin&quot;&gt;&quot;It was Chekhov who first deliberately wrote dialogue in which the mainstream of emotional action ran underneath the surface</span>
				<span class='text'>It was he who articulated the notion that human beings hardly ever speak in explicit terms among each other about their deepest emotions, that the great, tragic, climactic moments are often happening beneath outwardly trivial conversation</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The [[Group Theatre (New York)|Group Theatre]], in particular, developed the subtextual approach to drama, influencing generations of [[Theater in the United States|American playwrights]], screenwriters, and actors, including [[Clifford Odets]], [[Elia Kazan]] and, in particular, [[Lee Strasberg]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In turn, Strasberg's [[Actors Studio]] and the [[Method acting|&quot;Method&quot; acting]] approach influenced many actors, including [[Marlon Brando]] and [[Robert De Niro]], though by then the Chekhov tradition may have been distorted by a preoccupation with realism</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;&quot;Lee Strasberg became in my opinion a victim of the traditional idea of Chekhovian theatre&amp;nbsp;</span>

				<span class='text'>One of Anton's nephews, [[Michael Chekhov]] would also contribute heavily to modern theatre, particularly through his unique acting methods which differed from Stanislavski's</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; But he also declared &quot;[[The Lady with the Dog]]&quot; &quot;one of the greatest stories ever written&quot; in its depiction of a problematic relationship, and described Chekhov as writing &quot;the way one person relates to another the most important things in his life, slowly and yet without a break, in a slightly subdued voice</span>

				<span class='text'>In so doing we raise the question of our own fitness as readers</span>
				<span class='text'>Where the tune is familiar and the end emphatic—lovers united, villains discomfited, intrigues exposed—as it is in most [[Victorian literature|Victorian fiction]], we can scarcely go wrong, but where the tune is unfamiliar and the end a note of interrogation or merely the information that they went on talking, as it is in Tchekov, we need a very daring and alert sense of literature to make us hear the tune, and in particular those last notes which complete the harmony</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Chekhov is comic in a very special, paradoxical way</span>
				<span class='text'>His plays depend, as comedy does, on the vitality of the actors to make pleasurable what would otherwise be painfully awkward -- inappropriate speeches, missed connections, ''faux pas'', stumbles, childishness -- but as part of a deeper pathos; the stumbles are not pratfalls but an energized, graceful dissolution of purpose</span>
