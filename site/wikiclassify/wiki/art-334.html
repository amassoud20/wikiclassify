				<span class='text'>Other German contemporaries, [[Gottlieb Daimler]] and [[Wilhelm Maybach]] working as partners, also worked on similar types of inventions, without knowledge of the work of the other, but Benz received a [[patent]] for his work first, and, subsequently patented all the processes that made the [[internal combustion engine]] feasible for use in an automobile</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1879, his first engine patent was granted to him, and in 1886, Benz was granted a patent for his first automobile</span>

				<span class='text'>On September 30, 1860, at age fifteen, he passed the entrance exam for [[mechanical engineering]] at the [[University of Karlsruhe]], which he subsequently attended</span>
				<span class='text'>Benz was graduated July 9, 1864 at nineteen</span>
				<span class='text'>uring these years, while riding his [[bicycle]], he started to envision concepts for a vehicle that would eventually become the ''[[horseless carriage]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>ollowing his formal education, Benz had seven years of [[professional]] training in several companies, but did not fit well in any of them</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[training]] started in Karlsruhe with two years of varied jobs in a [[mechanical engineering]] company</span>

				<span class='text'>They had five children: Eugen (1873), Richard (1874), Clara (1877), Thilde (1882), and Ellen (1890)</span>
				<span class='text'>espite the business misfortunes, Karl Benz led in the development of new engines in the early factory he and his wife owned</span>
				<span class='text'>To get more revenues, in 1878 he began to work on new [[patent]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>First, he concentrated all his efforts on creating a reliable petrol [[two-stroke cycle|two-stroke engine]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Benz finished his two-stroke engine on December 31, 1878, New Year's Eve, and was granted a patent for it in 1879</span>
				<span class='text'>arl Benz showed his real genius, however, through his successive inventions registered while designing what would become the production standard for his two-stroke engine</span>
				<span class='text'>Benz soon patented the [[accelerator (car)|speed regulation]] system, the [[ignition system|ignition]] using sparks with [[battery (electricity)|battery]], the [[spark plug]], the [[carburetor]], the [[clutch]], the [[gear shift]], and the water [[radiator]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Benz's Gasmotoren-Fabrik Mannheim (1882–1883)==Problems arose again when the [[bank]]s at Mannheim demanded that Bertha and Karl Benz's enterprise be [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] due to the high production costs it maintained</span>
				<span class='text'>The Benzes were forced to improvise an association with [[photographer]] Emil Bühler and his brother (a [[cheese]] merchant), in order to get additional bank support</span>
				<span class='text'>The company became the [[joint-stock company]] ''[[Gasmotoren Fabrik Mannheim]]'' in 1882</span>
				<span class='text'>fter all the necessary incorporation agreements, Benz was unhappy because he was left with merely five percent of the [[Share (finance)|shares]] and a modest position as director</span>
				<span class='text'>Worst of all, his ideas weren't considered when designing new products, so he withdrew from that corporation just one year later, in 1883</span>

				<span class='text'>he success of the company gave Benz the opportunity to indulge in his old passion of designing a ''horseless carriage''</span>
				<span class='text'>Based on his experience with, and fondness for, bicycles, he used similar technology when he created an [[automobile]]</span>

				<span class='text'>t was the first [[automobile]] entirely designed as such to generate its own power, not simply a motorized-stage coach or horse carriage, which is why Karl Benz was granted his patent and is regarded as its inventor</span>
				<span class='text'>he Motorwagen was patented on January 29, 1886 as DRP-37435: &quot;automobile fueled by gas&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The 1885 version was difficult to control, leading to a collision with a wall during a public demonstration</span>
				<span class='text'>The first successful tests on public roads were carried out in the early summer of 1886</span>
				<span class='text'>The next year Benz created the Motorwagen Model 2, which had several modifications, and in 1887, the definitive Model 3 with wooden wheels was introduced, showing at the Paris Expo the same year</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Georgano&quot;/&gt;Benz began to sell the vehicle (advertising it as the Benz Patent Motorwagen) in the late summer of 1888, making it the first commercially available automobile in history</span>
				<span class='text'>The second customer of the Motorwagen was a Parisian [[bicycle]] manufacturer &lt;ref name=&quot;Georgano&quot;/&gt; [[Emile Roger]], who had already been building Benz engines under license from Karl Benz for several years</span>
				<span class='text'>Roger added the Benz automobiles (many built in France) to the line he carried in Paris and initially most were sold there</span>

				<span class='text'>This limitation was rectified after [[Bertha Benz]] made her famous trip driving one of the vehicles a great distance and suggested to her husband the addition of another gear</span>
				<span class='text'>n important part in the Benz story is this '''first long distance automobile trip''', where the entrepreneurial Bertha Benz, supposedly without the knowledge of her husband, on the morning of August 5, 1888, took this vehicle on a {{convert|106|km|mi|abbr=on}} trip from Mannheim to [[Pforzheim]] to visit her mother, taking her sons Eugen and Richard with her</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition to having to locate pharmacies on the way to fuel up, she repaired various technical and mechanical problems and invented brake lining</span>
				<span class='text'>After some longer downhill slopes, she ordered a shoemaker to nail leather on the brake blocks</span>

				<span class='text'>''Benz &amp; Cie</span>
				<span class='text'>' had grown in the interim from 50 employees in 1889 to 430 in 1899</span>
				<span class='text'>uring the last years of the nineteenth century, ''Benz'' was the largest automobile company in the world with 572 units produced in 1899</span>
				<span class='text'>ecause of its size, in 1899, ''Benz &amp; Cie</span>
				<span class='text'>' became a [[joint-stock company]] with the arrival of [[Friedrich von Fischer]] and [[Julius Ganß]], who came aboard as members of the [[Board of directors|Board of Management]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Ganß worked in the commercialization department, which is somewhat similar to [[marketing]] in contemporary corporations</span>
				<span class='text'>he new directors recommended that Benz should create a less expensive automobile suitable for [[mass production]]</span>

				<span class='text'>n 1895, Benz designed the first [[truck]] in history, with some of the units later modified by the first motor [[bus]] company: the ''[[Netphener]]'', becoming the first motor buses in history</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1896, Karl Benz was granted a [[patent]] for his design of the first '''[[flat engine]]'''</span>
				<span class='text'>It had horizontally opposed [[piston]]s, a design in which the corresponding pistons reach top dead centre simultaneously, thus balancing each other with respect to [[momentum]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Flat engines with four or fewer cylinders are most commonly called '''boxer''' engines, ''boxermotor'' in German, and also are known as ''horizontally opposed engines''</span>
				<span class='text'>This design is still used by [[Porsche]], [[Subaru]], and some high performance engines used in [[racing cars]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In motorcycles, the most famous boxer engine is found in [[History of BMW motorcycles|BMW motorcycles]],{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} though the boxer engine design was used in many other models, including [[Zundapp]], [[History of BMW motorcycles|Wooler]], [[Douglas Dragonfly]], [[Ratier]], Universal, [[IMZ-Ural]], [[Dnepr (motorcycle)|Dnepr]], [[Gnome et Rhône]], [[Chang Jiang (motorcycle)|Chang Jiang]], [[Marusho]], and the [[Honda Gold Wing]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough [[Gottlieb Daimler]] died in March 1900—and there is no evidence that Benz and [[Gottlieb Daimler|Daimler]] knew each other nor that they knew about each other's early achievements—eventually, competition with [[Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft]] (DMG) in [[Stuttgart]] began to challenge the leadership of Benz &amp; Cie</span>
				<span class='text'>In October 1900, the main designer of DMG, [[Wilhelm Maybach]], built the engine that would later be used in the  ''[[Mercedes 35hp|Mercedes-35hp]]'' of 1902</span>
				<span class='text'>The engine was built to the specifications of [[Emil Jellinek]] under a contract for him to purchase thirty-six vehicles with the engine, and for him to become a dealer of the special series</span>
				<span class='text'>Jellinek stipulated the new engine be named Daimler-''Mercedes'' (for his daughter)</span>
				<span class='text'>Maybach would quit DMG in 1907, but he designed the model and all of the important changes</span>
				<span class='text'>After testing, the first was delivered to Jellinek on December 22, 1900</span>
				<span class='text'>Jellinek continued to make suggestions for changes to the model and obtained good results racing the automobile in the next few years, encouraging DMG to engage in commercial production of automobiles, which they did in 1902</span>

				<span class='text'>At first, the production models were raced and the Benz ''Velo'' participated in the first automobile race: [[Auto racing#Paris–Rouen: the world's first motoring contest|Paris to Rouen 1894]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Later, investment in developing [[racecar]]s for [[motorsports]] produced returns through sales generated by the association of the name of the automobile with the winners</span>
				<span class='text'>Unique race vehicles were built at the time, as seen in the photograph here of the Benz, the first [[mid-engine]] and [[aerodynamically]] designed, ''Tropfenwagen'', a &quot;teardrop&quot; body introduced at the 1923 [[European Grand Prix]] at [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]]</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1923 ''Benz &amp; Cie</span>

				<span class='text'>Negotiations between the two companies resumed and in 1924 they signed an &quot;Agreement of Mutual Interest&quot; valid until the year 2000</span>
				<span class='text'>Both enterprises standardized design, production, purchasing, sales, and advertising—marketing their automobile models jointly—although keeping their respective brands</span>
				<span class='text'>n June 28, 1926, Benz &amp; Cie</span>
				<span class='text'>and DMG finally merged as the ''[[Daimler-Benz]]'' company, baptizing all of its automobiles, ''[[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes Benz]]'', honoring the most important model of the DMG automobiles, the 1902 ''[[Mercedes 35 hp]]'', along with the Benz name</span>
				<span class='text'>The name of that DMG model had been selected after ten-year-old [[Mercédès Jellinek]], the daughter of [[Emil Jellinek]] who had set the specifications for the new model</span>
