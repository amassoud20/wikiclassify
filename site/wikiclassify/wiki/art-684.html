				<span class='text'>Ulugh Beg was born in [[Sultaniyeh]] in [[Persia]] during Timur's invasion</span>
				<span class='text'>As a child he wandered through a substantial part of the Middle East and [[India]] as his grandfather expanded his conquests in those areas</span>
				<span class='text'>After Timur's death, however, and the accession of Ulugh Beg's father to much of the [[Timurid Empire]], he settled in [[Samarkand]], which had been Timur's capital</span>
				<span class='text'>After Shah Rukh moved the capital to [[Herat, Afghanistan|Herat]] (in modern [[Afghanistan]]), sixteen-year-old Ulugh Beg became his governor in Samarkand in 1409</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1411, he became the sovereign ruler of the whole [[Transoxiana|Mavarannahr]] [[khanate]]</span>
				<span class='text'>= Science ==The teenaged ruler set out to turn the city into an intellectual center for the empire</span>
				<span class='text'>Between 1417 and 1420, he built a ''[[Madrasah|madrasa]]'' (&quot;university&quot; or &quot;institute&quot;) on [[Registan|Registan Square]] in Samarkand (currently in [[Uzbekistan]]), and he invited numerous [[Islamic astronomy|Islamic astronomers]] and [[Islamic mathematics|mathematicians]] to study there</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''madrasa'' building still survives</span>
				<span class='text'>Ulugh Beg's most famous pupil in [[astronomy]] was [[Ali Qushji|Ali Qushchi]] (died in 1474)</span>
				<span class='text'>e was also famous in the fields of medicine and poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>He used to debate with other poets about contemporary social issues</span>
				<span class='text'>He liked to debate in a poetic style, called &quot;Bahribayt&quot; among local poets</span>
				<span class='text'>According to the medical book &quot;Mashkovskiy&quot; which is in the Russian language, Ulugh Beg discovered the mixture of alcohol with garlic, apparently preserving it to help treat conditions like diarrhea, headache, stomach ache and intestine illnesses</span>
				<span class='text'>He also offered advice for newly married couples: Indicating recipes contains nuts, dried apricot, dried grape etc</span>
				<span class='text'>that he claimed to be useful to increase men`s virility</span>
				<span class='text'>This recipe has been given in Ibn Sina`s books also</span>

				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|250px|left|[[Ulugh Beg Observatory]] in [[Samarkand]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In Ulugh Beg's time, these walls were lined with polished [[marble]]</span>
				<span class='text'>]]=== Astronomy ===His own particular interests concentrated on [[astronomy]], and, in 1428, he built an enormous [[observatory]], called the ''Gurkhani Zij'', similar to [[Tycho Brahe]]'s later [[Uraniborg]] as well as [[Taqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf|Taqi al-Din]]'s [[Istanbul observatory of Taqi al-Din|observatory in Istanbul]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Lacking [[telescope]]s to work with, he increased his accuracy by increasing the length of his [[sextant (astronomical)|sextant]]; the so-called [[Sextant (astronomical)|''Fakhri'' sextant]] had a radius of about {{convert|36|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} and the [[Angular resolution|optical separability]] of 180&quot; (seconds of arc)</span>
				<span class='text'>sing it, he compiled the 1437 ''[[Zij-i-Sultani]]'' of 994 [[star]]s, generally considered{{Who|date=November 2009}} the greatest [[star catalogue]] between those of [[Ptolemy]] and Brahe, a work that stands alongside [[Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi]]'s ''[[Book of Fixed Stars]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The serious errors which he found in previous Arabian star catalogues (many of which had simply updated Ptolemy's work, adding the effect of [[precession of the equinoxes|precession]] to the longitudes) induced him to redetermine the positions of 992 fixed stars, to which he added 27 stars from [[Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi]]'s catalogue ''[[Book of Fixed Stars]]'' from the year 964, which were too far south for observation from Samarkand</span>
				<span class='text'>This catalogue, one of the most original of the Middle Ages, was first edited by [[Thomas Hyde]] at Oxford in 1665 under the title ''Tabulae longitudinis et latitudinis stellarum fixarum ex observatione Ulugbeighi'' and reprinted in 1767 by G</span>
				<span class='text'>Sharpe</span>
				<span class='text'>More recent editions are those by [[Francis Baily]] in 1843 in ''vol</span>
				<span class='text'>xiii'' of the ''Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society'' and by [[Edward Ball Knobel]] in ''Ulugh Beg's Catalogue of Stars, Revised from all Persian Manuscripts Existing in Great Britain, with a Vocabulary of Persian and Arabic Words'' (1917)</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Ulugh Beg and his astronomical observatory scheme, depicted on the 1987 [[USSR]] stamp</span>
				<span class='text'>He was one of Islam's greatest astronomers during the [[Middle Ages]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The stamp says &quot;Uzbek astronomer and mathematician Ulugbek&quot; in Russian</span>
				<span class='text'>]In 1437, Ulugh Beg determined the length of the [[sidereal year]] as 365</span>
				<span class='text'>570370</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; = 365&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; 6&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; 8&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt; (an error of +58&amp;nbsp;seconds)</span>
				<span class='text'>In his measurements within many years he used a 50&amp;nbsp;m high [[gnomon]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This value was improved by 28&amp;nbsp;seconds in 1525 by [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], who appealed to the estimation of [[Thabit ibn Qurra]] (826‚Äì901), which had an error of +2&amp;nbsp;seconds</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Beg later measured another more precise value as 365&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; 5&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt; 49&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; 15&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;, which has an error of +25&amp;nbsp;seconds, making it more accurate than Copernicus' estimate which had an error of +30&amp;nbsp;seconds</span>
				<span class='text'>Beg also determined the Earth's [[axial tilt]] as 23</span>
				<span class='text'>2 degrees, which remained the most accurate measurement for hundreds of years</span>
				<span class='text'>It was more accurate than later measurements by Copernicus and [[Tycho Brahe]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;=== Mathematics ===In [[Islamic mathematics|mathematics]], Ulugh Beg wrote accurate [[Trigonometry|trigonometric]] tables of [[Trigonometric function|sine]] and [[tangent (trigonometric function)|tangent]] values correct to at least eight decimal places</span>
				<span class='text'>= Death ==Ulugh Beg's scientific expertise was not matched by his skills in governance</span>
				<span class='text'>When he heard of the death of his father [[Shahrukh Mirza]], Ulugh Beg went to [[Balkh]], where he heard that his nephew [[Ala-ud-Daulah Mirza bin Baysonqor]], son of Ulugh's brother [[Baysonqor]], had claimed the emirship of the [[Timurid Empire]] in [[Herat]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Consequently, Ulugh Beg marched against Ala-ud-Daulah and met him in battle at [[Bala Murghab|Murghab]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Having won this battle, Ulugh Beg advanced toward Herat and massacred its people in 1448, but Ala-ud-Daulah's brother [[Mirza Abul-Qasim Babur bin Baysonqor]] came to his aid, defeating Ulugh Beg</span>
				<span class='text'>Ulugh Beg retreated to Balkh, where he found that its governor, his oldest son [[Abdal-Latif Mirza]], had rebelled against him</span>
				<span class='text'>Another civil war ensued</span>
				<span class='text'>Within two years, he was beheaded by the order of his own eldest son while on his way to [[Mecca]]</span>

				<span class='text'>'&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, his reputation was rehabilitated by his nephew, [[Abdallah Mirza]] (1450‚Äì1451), who placed Ulugh Beg's remains in the mausoleum of [[Timur]] in Samarkand, where they were found by archeologists in 1941</span>
