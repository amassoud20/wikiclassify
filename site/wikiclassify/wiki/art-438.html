				<span class='text'>He was pope for nine years, from 1503 to 1513</span>
				<span class='text'>From the beginning, Julius II set to rid himself of the various powers by which his temporal authority was almost overwhelmed</span>
				<span class='text'>By a series of complicated stratagems he first succeeded in rendering it impossible for the [[House of Borgia|Borgias]] to retain their power over the [[Papal States]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Indeed, on the day of his election, he declared: &quot;I will not live in the same rooms as the Borgias lived</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;NC2&quot;/&gt;Julius II then used his influence to reconcile the two powerful Roman families of [[Orsini family|Orsini]] and [[Colonna family|Colonna]], and, by decrees made in their interest, he also attached to himself the remainder of the Roman nobility</span>
				<span class='text'>eing thus secure in Rome and the surrounding country, he next set himself to oust the [[Republic of Venice]] from [[Faenza]], [[Rimini]], and the other towns and fortresses of Italy which it occupied after the death of Pope Alexander</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1504, finding it impossible to succeed with the [[Doge of Venice]] by remonstrance, he brought about a union of the conflicting interests of [[France]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and sacrificed temporarily to some extent the independence of Italy to conclude with them an offensive and defensive alliance against [[Venice]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The combination was, however, at first little more than nominal, and was not immediately effective in compelling the Venetians to deliver up more than a few unimportant places in the [[Romagna]]</span>
				<span class='text'>With a campaign in 1506, Julius succeeded in freeing [[Perugia]] and [[Bologna]] from their despots (Giampolo Baglioni and [[Giovanni II Bentivoglio]], respectively)</span>
				<span class='text'>n December 1503, Julius issued a dispensation allowing [[Henry VIII of England]] to marry [[Catherine of Aragon]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Catherine had previously been briefly married to Henry's brother [[Arthur Tudor|Prince Arthur]], who had died, but maintained that she had remained a virgin for the six months of the marriage</span>
				<span class='text'>Some twenty years later, when Henry was in love with [[Anne Boleyn]], he sought to have his marriage annulled, claiming that the dispensation should never have been issued</span>
				<span class='text'>The refusal of Pope [[Clement VII]] to grant the annulment led to the [[English Reformation]]</span>
				<span class='text'>is ''[[Ea quae pro bono pacis]]'' of January 24, 1506, confirmed papal approval of the ''[[mare clausum]]'' policy being pursued by [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] and [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal]] amid their [[Age of Discovery|explorations]] and approved the changes of the 1494 [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] to previous papal bulls</span>
				<span class='text'>The same year, he founded the [[Swiss Guard]] to provide a constant corps of soldiers to protect the Pope</span>

				<span class='text'>The League fought against the [[Republic of Venice]] during the &quot;[[War of the League of Cambrai|War of the Holy League]]&quot; (also known as the &quot;War of the League of Cambrai&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'> Among other things, Julius wanted the Venetian possession of [[Romagna]]; Emperor Maximilian I wanted [[Friuli]] and [[Veneto]]; Louis XII wanted Cremona; and Ferdinand II wanted the [[Apulia]]n ports</span>
				<span class='text'> This war was a conflict in what was collectively known as the &quot;[[Italian Wars]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>n the spring of 1509, the Republic of Venice was placed under an [[interdict]] by Julius</span>

				<span class='text'> For example, in 1510 Venice and France switched places</span>
				<span class='text'> By 1513, Venice had joined France</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Sisto della Rovere</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|[[Sisto Gara della Rovere]], the fifth and final cardinal-nephew of Julius II was the Prior in Rome of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights Hospitaller of Malta]] ]]The achievements of the League soon outstripped the primary intention of Julius</span>
				<span class='text'>By one single battle, the [[Battle of Agnadello]] on 14 May 1509, the dominion of Venice in Italy was practically lost</span>
				<span class='text'> But, as neither the King of France nor the Holy Roman Emperor were satisfied with merely effecting the purposes of the Pope, the latter found it necessary to enter into an arrangement with the Venetians to defend himself from those who immediately before had been his allies</span>
				<span class='text'> The Venetians, on making humble submission, were absolved at the beginning of 1510, and shortly afterward France was placed under papal [[interdict]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Attempts to cause a rupture between France and [[England]] proved unsuccessful</span>
				<span class='text'> On the other hand, at a [[synod]] convened by Louis at [[Tours]] in September 1510, the French bishops withdrew from papal obedience, and resolved, with Emperor Maximilian's co-operation, to seek the deposition of the pope</span>
				<span class='text'> In November 1511, a council met for this objective at [[Pisa]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ulius thereupon entered into the &quot;[[Holy League (1511)|Holy League of 1511]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'> He allied with Ferdinand II of Aragon and the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] against France</span>
				<span class='text'>In short time, both [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII, King of England]] (1509–47), and [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] also joined the &quot;Holy League of 1511</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; During his last months of life, he engaged in negotiations with Ferdinand's diplomats, who obtained from him the ideological back-up necessary for [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]]'s [[Spanish conquest of Iberian Navarre|invasion of Navarre]] in the form of papal bulls</span>
				<span class='text'>ulius convened a general council (that afterward was known as the [[Fifth Council of the Lateran]]) to be held at Rome in 1512, which, according to an oath taken on his election, he had bound himself to summon, but which had been delayed, he affirmed, because of the occupation of Italy by his enemies</span>
				<span class='text'>=Death==In 1512 the French were driven across the [[Alps]], but it was at the cost of the occupation of Italy by the other powers, and Julius, though he had securely established the papal authority in the states immediately around Rome, was practically as far as ever from realizing his dream of an independent Italian kingdom when he died of fever in February 1513</span>
				<span class='text'>t is a common error that many associate the burial place of Julius as being in [[San Pietro in Vincoli]] as the location for the so-called &quot;[[Tomb of Pope Julius II|Tomb of Julius]]&quot; by [[Michelangelo]]</span>
				<span class='text'>However, this tomb was not completed until 1545 and represents a much abbreviated version of the planned original, which was initially intended for the new [[St</span>
				<span class='text'>Peter's Basilica]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, as was always intended, Julius was buried in St</span>
				<span class='text'>Peter's in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]</span>
				<span class='text'>is remains, along with those of his uncle, [[Pope Sixtus IV]], were later desecrated during the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]] in 1527</span>
				<span class='text'>Today, the remains of both lie in St</span>

				<span class='text'>Peter's Basilica</span>
				<span class='text'>However, he also demolished the old St</span>
				<span class='text'>Peter's Basilica, which had stood for more than 1,100 years</span>
				<span class='text'> He was a friend and patron of [[Donato Bramante|Bramante]] and [[Raphael]], and a patron of [[Michelangelo]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Several of Michelangelo's greatest works (including the painting of the ceiling of the [[Sistine Chapel]]) were commissioned by Julius</span>
				<span class='text'>== Character =======Appearance====Julius II is usually depicted with a beard, after his appearance in the celebrated [[Portrait of Pope Julius II (Raphael)|portrait]] by [[Raphael]]</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the pope only wore his beard from 27 June 1511 to March 1512, as a sign of mourning at the loss of the city of [[Bologna]] by the [[Papal States]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was nevertheless the first pope since antiquity to wear a beard, a practice otherwise forbidden by [[canon law]] since the 13th century</span>
				<span class='text'>Julius shaved his beard again before his death, and his immediate successors were clean-shaven; however, [[Pope Clement VII]] again adopted the beard as a sign of mourning after the 1527 [[sack of Rome (1527)|sack of Rome]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Thenceforward, all popes were bearded until the death of [[Pope Innocent XII]] in 1700</span>

				<span class='text'>[[Felice della Rovere]] survived into adulthood</span>
				<span class='text'>Pompeo Litta&lt;ref&gt;Litta, &quot;Famiglie Celebri Italiane&quot; (Celebrated Italian Families), 1833&lt;/ref&gt; mistakenly ascribed Felice's two daughters, Giulia and Clarice, to him as well</span>
				<span class='text'>Shortly after Felice was born, Julius arranged for Lucrezia to marry Bernardino de Cupis</span>
				<span class='text'>Bernardino was the chamberlain of Julius's cousin, Cardinal [[Girolamo Basso della Rovere]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;A definitive life of Felice della Rovere is in Caroline P</span>

				<span class='text'>' (Oxford University Press, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;Despite an illegitimate daughter (and at least one mistress), it was also suggested that Julius may have had [[homosexual]] lovers - although there is no evidence that he was sexually active as pope</span>
				<span class='text'>His confrontational style inevitably created enemies and [[sodomy]] was the &quot;common currency of insult and innuendo&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Christine Ward, ''Julius II: Warrior Pope''&lt;/ref&gt; Such accusations were made to discredit him, but perhaps in doing so accusers were attacking a perceived weak point</span>
				<span class='text'>The Venetians — who were opposed to the pope's new military policy - were among the most vocal; most notably the diarist [[Girolamo Priuli (1476-1547)|Girolamo Priuli]],&lt;ref&gt;G</span>

				<span class='text'>Jan Sperna Weil, ''Erasmus of Rotterdam: The Man and the Scholar'', 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism was furthermore made of the sinister influence exerted by his advisor, [[Francesco Alidosi]], who Julius had made a cardinal in 1505</span>
				<span class='text'>However, it is likely that the closeness was down to the fact that he simply knew how to handle him well</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Majanlahti, ''The families who made Rome''&lt;/ref&gt; This sexual reputation survived Julius, and the accusation continued to be made without reservation by Protestant opponents in their polemics against &quot;papism&quot; and Catholic decadence</span>
				<span class='text'>The French writer [[Philippe de Mornay]] (1549-1623) accused all Italians of being sodomites, but added specifically: &quot;This horror is ascribed to good Julius</span>
