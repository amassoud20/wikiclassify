				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|alt=slender, middle-aged man, clean-shaven with full head of hair, seen in profile|right|Ravel in 1925]]'''Joseph Maurice Ravel''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒɔzɛf mɔʁis ʁavɛl|lang}}; 7 March 1875 – 28 December 1937) was a French composer, pianist and conductor</span>
				<span class='text'>He is often associated with [[Impressionism in music|impressionism]] along with his elder contemporary [[Claude Debussy]], although both composers rejected the term</span>
				<span class='text'>In the 1920s and '30s Ravel was internationally regarded as France's greatest living composer</span>
				<span class='text'>orn to a music-loving family, Ravel attended France's premier music college, the [[Paris Conservatoire]]; he was not well regarded by its conservative establishment, whose biased treatment of him caused a scandal</span>
				<span class='text'>After leaving the conservatoire Ravel found his own way as a composer, developing a style of great clarity, incorporating elements of [[baroque music|baroque]], [[Neoclassicism (music)|neoclassicism]] and, in his later works, jazz</span>
				<span class='text'>He liked to experiment with musical form, as in his best-known work, ''[[Boléro]]'' (1928), in which repetition takes the place of development</span>
				<span class='text'>He made some orchestral arrangements of other composers' music, of which his 1922 version of [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]'s ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]'' is the best known</span>
				<span class='text'>s a slow and painstaking worker, Ravel composed fewer pieces than many of his contemporaries</span>
				<span class='text'>Among his works to enter the repertoire are pieces for piano, chamber music, two piano concertos, ballet music, two operas, and eight song cycles; he wrote no symphonies or religious works</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of his works exist in two versions: a first, piano score and a later orchestration</span>
				<span class='text'>Some of his piano music, such as ''[[Gaspard de la nuit]]'' (1908), is exceptionally difficult to play, and his complex orchestral works such as ''[[Daphnis et Chloé]]'' (1912) require skilful balance in performance</span>
				<span class='text'>avel was among the first composers to recognise the potential of recording to bring their music to a wider public</span>
				<span class='text'>From the 1920s, despite limited technique as a pianist or conductor, he took part in recordings of several of his works; others were made under his supervision</span>

				<span class='text'>His father, [[Pierre-Joseph Ravel]], was an educated and successful engineer, inventor and manufacturer, born in [[Versoix]] near the Franco-Swiss border</span>

				<span class='text'>1&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Joseph's family is described in some sources as French and in others as Swiss; Versoix is in present-day (2015) Switzerland, but as the historian Philippe Morant observes, the nationality of families from the area changed several times over the generations as borders were moved; Joseph held a French passport,&lt;ref name=n390&gt;Nichols (2011), p</span>
				<span class='text'>390&lt;/ref&gt; but Ravel preferred to say simply that his paternal ancestors came from the [[Jura Mountains|Jura]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Quoted'' in Nichols (2011), p</span>
				<span class='text'>3&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} His mother, Marie, ''née'' Delouart, was [[Basque people|Basque]] but had grown up in Madrid</span>
				<span class='text'>In 19th-century terms, Joseph had married beneath his status – Marie was illegitimate and barely literate – but the marriage was a happy one</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Nichols (2011), p</span>
				<span class='text'>6&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Joseph's inventions were successful, including an early [[internal combustion engine]] and a notorious circus machine, the &quot;Whirlwind of Death&quot;, an automotive loop-the-loop that was a big draw until a fatal accident at [[Ringling Bros</span>
				<span class='text'>and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus|Barnum and Bailey's Circus]] in 1903</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;James, p</span>
				<span class='text'>13&lt;/ref&gt;Both Ravel's parents were [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]]; Marie was also something of a [[Freethought|free-thinker]], a trait inherited by her elder son, who was always politically and socially progressive in outlook in adult life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Orenstein (1991), p</span>
				<span class='text'>9&lt;/ref&gt; He was baptised in the Ciboure parish church six days after he was born</span>
				<span class='text'>The family moved to Paris three months later, and there a younger son, Édouard, was born</span>
				<span class='text'>He was close to his father, whom he eventually followed into the engineering profession</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Orenstein, 1991, p</span>
				<span class='text'>8&quot;/&gt; Maurice was particularly devoted to their mother; her Basque-Spanish heritage was a strong influence on his life and music</span>

				<span class='text'>91–92&lt;/ref&gt;Ravel senior delighted in taking his sons to factories to see the latest mechanical devices, but he also had a keen interest in music and culture in general</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Orenstein (1991), p</span>
				<span class='text'>10&lt;/ref&gt; In later life, Ravel recalled, &quot;Throughout my childhood I was sensitive to music</span>
				<span class='text'>My father, much better educated in this art than most amateurs are, knew how to develop my taste and to stimulate my enthusiasm at an early age</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Quoted'' in Goss, p</span>
				<span class='text'>23&lt;/ref&gt; There is no record that Ravel received any formal general schooling in his early years; his biographer Roger Nichols suggests that the boy may have been chiefly educated by his father</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=n9/&gt;When he was seven Ravel started piano lessons with Henry Ghys, a friend of [[Emmanuel Chabrier]]; five years later, in 1887, he began studying [[harmony]], [[counterpoint]] and composition with Charles-René, a pupil of [[Léo Delibes]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=n9&gt;Nichols (2011), p</span>
				<span class='text'>9&lt;/ref&gt; Without being anything of a child prodigy, he was a highly musical boy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Goss, p</span>
				<span class='text'>23&lt;/ref&gt; Charles-René found that Ravel's conception of music was natural to him &quot;and not, as in the case of so many others, the result of effort&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Goss, p</span>
				<span class='text'>24&lt;/ref&gt; Ravel's earliest known compositions date from this period: variations on a chorale by [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], variations on a theme by [[Edvard Grieg|Grieg]] and a single movement of a piano sonata</span>

				<span class='text'>475&lt;/ref&gt;In 1888 Ravel met the young pianist [[Ricardo Viñes]], who became not only a lifelong friend, but also one of the foremost interpreters of his works, and an important link between Ravel and Spanish music</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;James, p</span>
				<span class='text'>15&lt;/ref&gt; The two shared an appreciation of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], Russian music, and the writings of [[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]], [[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]], and [[Stéphane Mallarmé|Mallarmé]]</span>

				<span class='text'>16&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Exposition Universelle]] in Paris in 1889, Ravel was much struck by the [[Russian Symphony Concerts|new Russian works]] conducted by [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]]</span>

				<span class='text'>11–12; and Nichols (2011), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>10–11&lt;/ref&gt; This music had a lasting effect on both Ravel and his older contemporary [[Claude Debussy]], as did the exotic sound of the Javanese [[gamelan]], also heard during the Exposition</span>

				<span class='text'>11&lt;/ref&gt;===Paris Conservatoire===With the encouragement of his parents, Ravel applied for entry to France's most important musical college, the [[Conservatoire de Paris]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In November 1889, playing music by [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]], he passed the examination for admission to the preparatory piano class run by Eugène Anthiòme</span>

				<span class='text'>11 and 390&lt;/ref&gt; Ravel won the first prize in the Conservatoire's piano competition in 1891, but otherwise he did not stand out as a student</span>
