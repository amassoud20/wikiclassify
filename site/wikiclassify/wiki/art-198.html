				<span class='text'>After victory had been finalized in 1783, Washington resigned as commander-in-chief rather than seize power, proving his opposition to dictatorship and his commitment to [[Republicanism in the United States|American republicanism]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Thanks also to Lawrence's involvement in the [[Ohio Company]], a land investment company funded by Virginia investors, and Lawrence's position as commander of the Virginia militia, Washington came to the notice of the new lieutenant governor of Virginia, [[Robert Dinwiddie]]</span>

				<span class='text'>NG|thumb|left|An engraving depicting the evening council of George Washington at Fort Necessity]]Dinwiddie sent Washington back to the [[Ohio Country]] to safeguard an Ohio Company's construction of a fort at present-day [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania</span>
				<span class='text'>However, before he reached the area, a French force drove out colonial traders and began construction of [[Fort Duquesne]]</span>
				<span class='text'>A small detachment of French troops led by [[Joseph Coulon de Jumonville]], was discovered by Tanacharison and a few warriors east of present-day [[Uniontown, Pennsylvania]]</span>
				<span class='text'>On May 28, 1754, Washington and some of his militia unit, aided by their [[Mingo]] allies, ambushed the French in what has come to be called the [[Battle of Jumonville Glen]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Exactly what happened during and after the battle is a matter of contention, but several primary accounts agree that the battle lasted about 15 minutes, that Jumonville was killed, and that most of his party were either killed or taken prisoner</span>

				<span class='text'>Historian [[Joseph Ellis]] concludes that the episode demonstrated Washington's bravery, initiative, inexperience and impetuosity</span>

				<span class='text'>17&quot;&gt;{{harvtxt|Ellis|2004|pp=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; These events had international consequences; the French accused Washington of assassinating Jumonville, who they claimed was on a diplomatic mission</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ellis, 2004 pp</span>
				<span class='text'>17&quot;/&gt; Both France and Great Britain were ready to fight for control of the region and both sent troops to North America in 1755; war was formally declared in 1756</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Anderson|2005|pp=100–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;===Braddock disaster 1755==={{main|Braddock Expedition}}In 1755 Washington became the senior American aide to British General [[Edward Braddock]] on the ill-fated Braddock expedition</span>
				<span class='text'>This was the largest British expedition to the colonies, and was intended to expel the French from the Ohio Country; the first objective was the capture of [[Fort Duquesne]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Alden|1993|pp=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Washington initially sought an appointment as a major from Braddock, but upon advice that no rank above captain could be given except by London, he agreed to serve as a staff volunteer</span>
				<span class='text'>During the passage of the expedition, Washington fell ill with severe headaches and fever; nevertheless, when the pace of the troops continued to slow, Washington recommended to Braddock that the army be split into two divisions – a primary and more lightly, but adequately equipped, &quot;flying column&quot; offensive which could move at a more rapid pace, to be followed by a more heavily armed reinforcing division</span>
				<span class='text'>Braddock accepted the recommendation (likely made in a [[council of war]] including other officers) and took command of the lead division</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Alden|1993|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ferling|2010|pp=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;In the [[Battle of the Monongahela]] the French and their Indian allies ambushed Braddock's reduced forces and the general was mortally wounded</span>
				<span class='text'>After suffering devastating casualties, the British panicked and retreated in disarray; however, Washington rode back and forth across the battlefield, rallying the remnants of the British and Virginian forces into an organized retreat</span>
				<span class='text'>In the process, despite his lingering illness, he demonstrated much bravery and stamina—he had two horses shot from underneath him, while his coat was pierced with four bullets</span>
				<span class='text'>In his report, Washington chiefly blamed the disaster on the conduct of the redcoats while praising that of the Virginia contingent</span>
				<span class='text'>Whatever responsibility rested on him for the defeat as a result of his recommendation to Braddock, Washington was not included by the succeeding commander, Col</span>
				<span class='text'>Thomas Dunbar, in planning subsequent force movements</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Alden|1993|pp=37–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;===Commander of Virginia Regiment===Lt</span>
				<span class='text'>Governor Dinwiddie rewarded Washington in 1755 with a commission as &quot;Colonel of the Virginia Regiment and Commander in Chief of all forces now raised in the defense of His Majesty's Colony&quot; and gave him the task of defending Virginia's frontier</span>
				<span class='text'>The Virginia Regiment was the first full-time American military unit in the colonies (as opposed to part-time militias and the British regular units)</span>
				<span class='text'>Washington was ordered to &quot;act defensively or offensively&quot; as he thought best</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Flexner|1965|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Washington happily accepted the commission, the coveted redcoat of a British officer as well as the accompanying pay continued to elude him</span>
				<span class='text'>Dinwiddie as well pressed in vain for the British military to incorporate the Virginia regiment into its ranks</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Alden|2010|pp=47, 54}}&lt;/ref&gt;In command of a thousand soldiers, Washington was a disciplinarian who emphasized training</span>
				<span class='text'>He led his men in brutal campaigns against the Indians in the west; in 10 months his regiment fought 20 battles, and lost a third of its men</span>
				<span class='text'>Washington's strenuous efforts meant that Virginia's frontier population suffered less than that of other colonies; Ellis concludes &quot;it was his only unqualified success&quot; in the war</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Fischer|2004|pp=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ellis|2004|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;In 1758 Washington participated in the [[Forbes Expedition]] to capture Fort Duquesne</span>
				<span class='text'>He was embarrassed by a friendly fire episode in which his unit and another British unit thought the other was the French enemy and opened fire, with 14 dead and 26 wounded in the mishap</span>
				<span class='text'>Washington was not involved in any other major fighting on the expedition, and the British scored a major strategic victory, gaining control of the Ohio Valley, when the French abandoned the fort</span>
				<span class='text'>Following the expedition, he retired from his Virginia Regiment commission in December 1758</span>
				<span class='text'>Washington did not return to military life until the outbreak of the revolution in 1775</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lengel|2005|pp=75–76, 81}}&lt;/ref&gt;===Lessons learned===Although Washington never gained the commission in the British army he yearned for, in these years the young man gained valuable military, political, and leadership skills</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He closely observed British military tactics, gaining a keen insight into their strengths and weaknesses that proved invaluable during the Revolution</span>
				<span class='text'>Washington learned to organize, train, drill, and discipline his companies and regiments</span>
				<span class='text'>From his observations, readings and conversations with professional officers, he learned the basics of battlefield tactics, as well as a good understanding of problems of organization and logistics</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Higginbotham|1985|pp=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gained an understanding of overall strategy, especially in locating strategic geographical points</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lengel|2005|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;He demonstrated his toughness and courage in the most difficult situations, including disasters and retreats</span>
				<span class='text'>He developed a command presence—given his size, strength, stamina, and bravery in battle, he appeared to soldiers to be a natural leader and they followed him without question</span>

				<span class='text'>Biographer John R</span>
				<span class='text'>Alden contends Washington offered &quot;fulsome and insincere flattery to British generals in vain attempts to win great favor&quot; and on occasion showed youthful arrogance, as well as jealousy and ingratitude in the midst of impatience</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Alden|1993|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;Historian [[Ron Chernow]] is of the opinion that his frustrations in dealing with government officials during this conflict led him to advocate the advantages of a strong national government and a vigorous executive agency that could get results;&lt;ref name=&quot;ch8&quot;/&gt; other historians tend to ascribe Washington's position on government to his later [[American Revolutionary War]] service</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Ellis and Ferling, for example, do not discuss this stance in reference to Washington's French and Indian War service, and cast it almost exclusively in terms of his negative experiences dealing with the Continental Congress during the Revolution</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He developed a very negative idea of the value of militia, who seemed too unreliable, too undisciplined, and too short-term compared to regulars</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Higginbotham|1985|pp=22–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, his experience was limited to command of at most 1000 men, and came only in remote frontier conditions that were far removed from the urban situations he faced during the Revolution at Boston, New York, Trenton and Philadelphia</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The British then articulated the peril of Washington and his army—on August 23, 1775 Britain issued a Royal proclamation labeling American rebels as traitors; if they resorted to force, they faced confiscation of their property</span>

				<span class='text'>peg|thumb|upright|''General George Washington at Trenton'' by [[John Trumbull]], [[Yale University Art Gallery]] (1792)]]General Washington essentially assumed three roles during the war</span>
				<span class='text'>First, in 1775–77, and again in 1781 he provided leadership of troops against the main British forces</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he lost many of his battles, he never surrendered his army during the war, and he continued to fight the British relentlessly until the war's end</span>
				<span class='text'>He plotted the overall strategy of the war, in cooperation with Congress</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ch3&quot;&gt;{{harvtxt|Higginbotham|1985|loc=ch</span>
				<span class='text'>3}}&lt;/ref&gt;Secondly, he was charged with organizing and training the army</span>
				<span class='text'>He recruited regulars and assigned [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben|Baron von Steuben]], a veteran of the Prussian general staff, to train them</span>
				<span class='text'>The war effort and getting supplies to the troops were under the purview of Congress,&lt;ref name=&quot;War Department&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wardepartmentpapers</span>
				<span class='text'>rg/blog/?m=201101|title=Creation of the War Department|work=Papers of the War Department, 1784–1800|publisher=[[Center for History and New Media]]|location=Fairfax, Virginia|date=January 20, 2011|accessdate=June 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Washington pressured the Congress to provide the essentials</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Carp|1990|p=220}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1776 Congress' first attempt at running the war effort was established with the committee known as &quot;Board of War and Ordnance&quot;, succeeded by the Board of War in July 1777, a committee which eventually included members of the military</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;War Department&quot;/&gt; The command structure of the armed forces was a hodgepodge of Congressional appointees (and Congress sometimes made those appointments without Washington's input) with state-appointments filling the lower ranks and of all of the militia-officers</span>
				<span class='text'> The results of his general staff were mixed, as some of his favorites (like [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan]]) never mastered the art of command</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ch3&quot;/&gt;Eventually, he found capable officers, such as General [[Nathanael Greene]], General [[Daniel Morgan]] - &quot;the old wagoner&quot; that he had served with in [[The French and Indian War]], [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Henry Knox]] - chief of artillery, and [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Alexander Hamilton]] - chief-of-staff</span>
				<span class='text'>The American officers never equaled their opponents in tactics and maneuver, and consequently they lost most of the pitched battles</span>
				<span class='text'>The great successes, at Boston (1776), [[Battles of Saratoga|Saratoga]] (1777) and [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] (1781), came from trapping the British far from base with much larger numbers of troops</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ch3&quot;/&gt; [[Daniel Morgan]]'s annihilation of [[Banastre Tarleton]]'s legion of dragoons at [[Battle of Cowpens|Cowpens]] in February 1781, came as a result of Morgan's employment of superior line tactics against his British opponent, resulting in one of the very few [[pincer movement|double envelopments]] in military history, another being [[Hannibal]]'s defeat of the Romans at [[Cannae]] in 216 b</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>The decisive defeat of Col</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Patrick Ferguson]]'s Tory Regiment at [[Battle of Kings Mountain|King's Mountain]] demonstrated the superiority of the riflery of American &quot;over mountain men&quot; over British-trained troops armed with musket and bayonet</span>
				<span class='text'>These &quot;over-mountain men&quot; were led by a variety of elected officers, including the 6'6&quot; [[William Campbell (general)|William Campbell]] who had become one of Washington's officers by the time of Yorktown</span>
				<span class='text'>Similarly, Morgan's Virginia riflemen proved themselves superior to the British at Saratoga, a post-revolutionary war development being the creation of trained &quot;rifle battalions&quot; in the European armies</span>
				<span class='text'>ashington's third, and most important role in the war effort, was the embodiment of armed resistance to the Crown—the representative man of the Revolution</span>
				<span class='text'>His long-term strategy was to maintain an army in the field at all times, and eventually this strategy worked</span>
				<span class='text'>His enormous personal and political stature and his political skills kept Congress, the army, the French, the militias, and the states all pointed toward a common goal</span>
				<span class='text'>Furthermore, by voluntarily resigning his commission and disbanding his army when the war was won (rather than declaring himself monarch), he permanently established the principle of civilian supremacy in military affairs</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet his constant reiteration of the point that well-disciplined professional soldiers counted for twice as much as erratic militias (clearly demonstrated in the rout at [[Battle of Camden|Camden]], where only the Maryland and Delaware Continentals under [[Baron DeKalb]] held firm), helped overcome the ideological distrust of a standing army</span>

				<span class='text'>The Continental Army under Washington engaged the enemy for the first time as an army of the newly independent United States at the [[Battle of Long Island]], the largest battle of the entire war</span>
				<span class='text'>The Americans were heavily outnumbered, many men deserted, and Washington was badly beaten</span>
				<span class='text'>Subsequently, Washington was forced to retreat across the [[East River]] at night</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Alden|1993|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;Washington then continued his flight across New Jersey; the future of the Continental Army was in doubt due to expiring enlistments and the string of losses</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ketchum|1999|p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the night of December 25, 1776, Washington staged a comeback with a [[Battle of Trenton|surprise attack on a Hessian outpost in western New Jersey]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He led his army [[Washington's crossing of the Delaware River|across the Delaware River]] to capture nearly 1,000 [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessians]] in Trenton, New Jersey</span>

				<span class='text'>The British retreated to New York City and its environs, which they held until the peace treaty of 1783</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Fischer|2004|p=367}}&lt;/ref&gt; These victories alone were not enough to ensure ultimate Patriot victory, however, since many soldiers did not reenlist or deserted during the harsh winter</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; While his southern commander Greene in 1780–81 did use Fabian tactics, Washington did so only in fall 1776 to spring 1777, after losing New York City and seeing much of his army melt away</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Battle of Trenton|Trenton]] and Princeton were Fabian examples</span>
				<span class='text'>By summer 1777, however, Washington had rebuilt his strength and his confidence; he stopped using raids and went for large-scale confrontations, as at Brandywine, Germantown, Monmouth and Yorktown</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Buchanan|2004|p=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;===1777 campaigns===In late summer of 1777, British General [[John Burgoyne]] led a [[Saratoga campaign|major invasion army]] south from Quebec, with the intention of splitting off rebellious New England; but General Howe in New York took his army [[Philadelphia campaign|south to Philadelphia]] instead of going up the Hudson River to join with Burgoyne near Albany—a major strategic mistake</span>
				<span class='text'>Meanwhile, Washington rushed to Philadelphia to engage Howe, while closely following the action in upstate New York, where the patriots were led by General [[Philip Schuyler]] and his successor [[Horatio Gates]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The ensuing pitched battles at Philadelphia were too complex for Washington's relatively inexperienced men and they were defeated</span>
				<span class='text'>At the [[Battle of Brandywine]] on September 11, 1777, Howe outmaneuvered Washington, and marched into the American capital at Philadelphia unopposed on September 26</span>
				<span class='text'>Washington's army [[Battle of Germantown|unsuccessfully attacked]] the British garrison at [[Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Germantown]] in early October</span>
				<span class='text'>Meanwhile to the north, Burgoyne, beyond the reach of help from Howe, was trapped and forced to surrender after the [[Battles of Saratoga]]</span>

				<span class='text'>8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a major turning point militarily and diplomatically—the French responded to Burgoyne's defeat by entering the war, allying with America and expanding the Revolutionary War into a major worldwide affair</span>

				<span class='text'>Although third-hand reports say he took [[Eucharist|communion]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Johnson|1919|pp=87–195}}&lt;/ref&gt; he is usually characterized as never or rarely participating in the rite</span>

				<span class='text'>Before the Revolutionary War he was Anglican—Church of England—which meant after the war, he was Episcopalian</span>
				<span class='text'>So, he was clearly Christian </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>He was quite intensely religious, because even though he uses the word Providence, he constantly sees Providence as an active force in life, particularly in American life</span>
				<span class='text'>I mean, every single victory in war he credits to Providence</span>
				<span class='text'>The miracle of the Constitutional Convention he credits to Providence</span>
				<span class='text'>The creation of the federal government and the prosperity of the early republic, he credits to Providence </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>I was struck at how frequently in his letters he's referring to Providence, and it's Providence where there's a sense of design and purpose, which sounds to me very much like religion </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Unfortunately, this particular issue has become very very politicized</span>
