				<span class='text'>One could do worse than be a swinger of birches</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/poem&gt;}}In 2003, the critic Charles McGrath noted that critical views on Frost's poetry have changed over the years (as has his public image)</span>
				<span class='text'>In an article called &quot;The Vicissitudes of Literary Reputation,&quot; McGrath wrote, &quot;Robert Frost&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>at the time of his death in 1963 was generally considered to be a New England folkie&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>In 1977, the third volume of Lawrance Thompson's biography suggested that Frost was a much nastier piece of work than anyone had imagined; a few years later, thanks to the reappraisal of critics like William H</span>
				<span class='text'>Pritchard and [[Harold Bloom]] and of younger poets like [[Joseph Brodsky]], he bounced back again, this time as a bleak and unforgiving modernist</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, Charles</span>

				<span class='text'>15 June 2003</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In ''The Norton Anthology of Modern Poetry'', editors [[Richard Ellmann]] and Robert O'Clair compared and contrasted Frost's unique style to the work of the poet [[Edwin Arlington Robinson]] since they both frequently used New England settings for their poems</span>
				<span class='text'>However, they state that Frost's poetry was &quot;less [consciously] literary&quot; and that this was possibly due to the influence of English and Irish writers like [[Thomas Hardy]] and [[W</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Yeats]]</span>
				<span class='text'>They note that Frost's poems &quot;show a successful striving for utter colloquialism&quot; and always try to remain down to earth, while at the same time using traditional forms despite the trend of American poetry towards free verse which Frost famously said was &quot;'like playing tennis without a net</span>

				<span class='text'>New York: Norton, 1988</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In providing an overview of Frost's style, the [[Poetry Foundation]] makes the same point, placing Frost's work &quot;at the crossroads of nineteenth-century American poetry [with regard to his use of traditional forms] and modernism [with his use of idiomatic language and ordinary, every day subject matter]</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; They also note that Frost believed that &quot;the self-imposed restrictions of meter in form&quot; was more helpful than harmful because he could focus on the content of his poems instead of concerning himself with creating &quot;innovative&quot; new verse forms</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;An earlier 1963 study by the poet [[James Radcliffe Squires]] spoke to the distinction of Frost as a poet whose verse soars more for the difficulty and skill by which he attains his final visions, than for the philosophical purity of the visions themselves</span>
				<span class='text'> &quot;'He has written at a time when the choice for the poet seemed to lie among the forms of despair: Science, solipsism, or the religion of the past century…Frost has refused all of these and in the refusal has long seemed less dramatically committed than others…But no, he must be seen as dramatically uncommitted to the single solution…Insofar as Frost allows to both fact and intuition a bright kingdom, he speaks for many of us</span>
				<span class='text'> Insofar as he speaks through an amalgam of senses and sure experience so that his poetry seems a nostalgic memory with overtones touching some conceivable future, he speaks better than most of us</span>
				<span class='text'>That is to say, as a poet must</span>

				<span class='text'>Whipple focused in on this bleakness in Frost's work, stating that &quot;in much of his work, particularly in ''North of Boston'', his harshest book, he emphasizes the dark background of life in rural New England, with its degeneration often sinking into total madness</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Stine 1983 110 129&quot;/&gt;In sharp contrast, the founding publisher and editor of ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]]'', [[Harriet Monroe]], emphasized the folksy New England persona and characters in Frost's work, writing that &quot;perhaps no other poet in our history has put the best of the Yankee spirit into a book so completely</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Stine 1983 110 129&quot;/&gt; She notes his frequent use of rural settings and farm life, and she likes that in these poems, Frost is most interested in &quot;showing the human reaction to nature's processes</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; She also notes that while Frost's narrative, character-based poems are often satirical, Frost always has a &quot;sympathetic humor&quot; towards his subjects</span>
