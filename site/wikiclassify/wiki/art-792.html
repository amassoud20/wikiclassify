				<span class='text'>He was the [[List of popes by length of reign|longest-reigning]] elected [[pope]] in the history of the Catholic Church – over 31 years (the longest serving, un-elected pope was [[Peter the Apostle]], posthumously considered the first pope, who was confirmed by [[Christ]] in 33 AD and killed by Emperor [[Nero]] in 67 AD)</span>
				<span class='text'>During his pontificate, he convened the [[First Vatican Council]] (1869–70), which decreed [[papal infallibility]], but the council was cut short due to the [[Italian unification|loss of the Papal States]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ius IX defined the [[dogma (Roman Catholic)|dogma]] of the [[Immaculate Conception]] of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Blessed Virgin Mary]], meaning that Mary was [[fertilisation|conceived]] without [[original sin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Pius IX also conferred the title [[Our Mother of Perpetual Help]] on a famous Byzantine icon from [[Crete]] entrusted to the [[Redemptorist]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>e was also the last pope to rule as the Sovereign of the [[Papal States]], which fell completely to the [[Regio Esercito|Italian army]] in 1870 and were incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After this, he was referred to – chiefly by himself – as the &quot;[[Prisoner in the Vatican|Prisoner of the Vatican]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>fter his death in 1878, his [[canonization]] process was opened on 11 February 1907 by [[Pope Pius X]] and it drew considerable controversy over the years</span>
				<span class='text'>It was closed on several occasions during the pontificates of [[Pope Benedict XV]] and [[Pope Pius XI]]</span>
				<span class='text'>On 7 December 1954, [[Pope Pius XII]] re-opened the cause and [[Pope John Paul II]] proclaimed him Venerable on 6 July 1985</span>
				<span class='text'>Together with [[Pope John XXIII]] he was [[beatified]] on 3 September 2000 after the recognition of a miracle and was assigned the liturgical feast day of February 7 which is the date of his death</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|150px|left|Pope Pius IX]]Europe, including the Italian peninsula, was in the midst of considerable political ferment when the bishop of Spoleto, Cardinal Giovanni Maria Mastai-Ferretti, was elected pope</span>
				<span class='text'>He took the name [[Pope Pius|Pius]], after his generous patron and the long-suffering prisoner of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], [[Pius VII]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He had been elected by the faction of cardinals sympathetic to the political liberalization coursing across Europe, and his initial governance of the Papal States gives evidence of his own liberal sympathies: Under his direction various sorts of political prisoners in the Papal States were released and the city of Rome was granted a constitutional framework under guidance of his friend, philosopher-prince [[Antonio Rosmini-Serbati]]</span>
				<span class='text'>A series of terrorist acts sponsored by Italian liberals and nationalists, which included the assassination of his Minister of the Interior, [[Pellegrino Rossi]], among others, and which forced him briefly to flee Rome in 1848 led to his growing skepticism towards the liberal, nationalist agenda</span>
				<span class='text'>Through the 1850s and 1860s, Italian nationalists made military gains against the Papal States, which culminated in the seizure of the city of Rome in 1870</span>
				<span class='text'>Thereafter, Pius IX refused to accept the [[Law of Guarantees]] from the Italian government, which would have made the Holy See dependent on legislation that the Italian parliament could modify at any time</span>
				<span class='text'>His Church policies towards other countries, such as Russia, Germany and France, were not always successful, due in part, to changing secular institutions and internal developments within these countries</span>
				<span class='text'>However, [[concordat]]s were concluded with numerous states such as [[Austria-Hungary]], Portugal, Spain, Canada, [[Tuscany]], Ecuador, Venezuela, Honduras, El Salvador and Haiti</span>

				<span class='text'>e was a [[Roman Catholic Mariology|Marian]] pope, who in his encyclical ''[[Ubi primum (Pius IX, 1849)|Ubi primum]]'' described Mary as a [[Mediatrix]] of salvation</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1854, he promulgated the [[Dogma (Roman Catholic)|dogma]] of the [[Immaculate Conception]], articulating a long-held Catholic belief that Mary, the Mother of God, was conceived without original sin</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1862, he convened 300 bishops to the Vatican for the canonization of [[Twenty-six Martyrs of Japan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His most important legacy is the [[First Vatican Council]], which convened in 1869</span>
				<span class='text'>This Council discussed many issues, especially the dogma of [[papal infallibility]], which Pius was eager to have officially defined by the council; but the council was interrupted as Italian nationalist troops threatened Rome</span>

				<span class='text'>He was educated at the [[Piarist]] College in [[Volterra]] and in Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>As a theology student in his hometown Sinigaglia, in 1814 he met [[Pope Pius VII]], who had returned from French captivity</span>

				<span class='text'>He was thus the first pope ever to have been in America</span>
				<span class='text'>When he returned to Rome, the successor of Pius VII, [[Pope Leo XII]] appointed him head of the hospital of San Michele in Rome (1825–1827) and [[canon (priest)|canon]] of Santa Maria in Via Lata</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Schmidlin 8&quot;/&gt; In 1831, the abortive revolution that had begun in Parma and Modena spread to Spoleto; the Archbishop obtained a general pardon after it was suppressed, gaining him a reputation for being liberal</span>

				<span class='text'>As in Spoleto, his episcopal priorities were the formation of priests through improved education and charities</span>
				<span class='text'>He became known for visiting prisoners in jail, and for programs for street children</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Schmidlin 10&lt;/ref&gt; According to historians, Cardinal Mastai-Ferretti was considered a liberal during his episcopate in Spoleto and Imola because he supported administrative changes in the [[Papal States]] and sympathized with the nationalist movement in Italy</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|An 1846 picture of Pope Pius IX soon after his election to the papacy</span>
				<span class='text'>]The [[Papal conclave|conclave]] of 1846, following the death of [[Pope Gregory XVI]] (1831–46), took place in an unsettled political climate within Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>Because of this, many foreign [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]]s decided not to attend the conclave</span>
				<span class='text'>At its start, only 46 out of 62 cardinals were present</span>
				<span class='text'>oreover, the conclave of 1846 was steeped in a factional division between [[conservatism|conservatives]] and [[modernism|liberals]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The conservatives supported [[Luigi Lambruschini]], [[Pope Gregory XVI|Gregory XVI]]'s [[Cardinal Secretary of State]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Liberals supported two candidates: [[Pasquale Tommaso Gizzi]] and the then 54-year-old Mastai-Ferretti</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Duffy 222&quot;&gt;Duffy 222&lt;/ref&gt; A fourth ''papabile'' was Cardinal [[Ludovico Micara]] the Dean of the College of Cardinals who was favored by the residents of Rome itself but he never gained support among the cardinals</span>

				<span class='text'>tm|author=Valérie Pirie}}&lt;/ref&gt;During the first ballot, Mastai-Ferretti received 15 votes, the rest going to Cardinal Lambruschini and Cardinal Gizzi</span>
				<span class='text'> Lambruschini received a majority of the votes in the early ballots, but failed to achieve the required two-thirds majority</span>
				<span class='text'>Cardinal Gizzi was favored by the French government but failed to get further support from the cardinals and the conclave ended up ultimately as a contest between Cardinals Lambruschini and Mastai-Ferretti</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pirie – Pius 09&quot;/&gt;  In the meantime, Cardinal Tommaso Bernetti reportedly received information that [[Carlo Gaetano Gaisruck|Karl Kajetan von Gaisruck]] the Austrian Archbishop of Milan was on his way to the conclave to veto the election of Mastai-Ferretti</span>
				<span class='text'> According to historian Valèrie Pirie, Cardinal Bernetti realized that if Lambruschini was to be stopped and Mastai-Ferretti was to be elected he had to convince the cardinals within a few hours or accept the election of Lambruschini</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pirie – Pius 09&quot;/&gt; Bernetti then on his own initiative personally convinced the majority of the electors to switch their support to Mastai-Ferretti</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pirie – Pius 09&quot;/&gt;  Cardinal Mastai-Ferretti himself however made no effort to campaign for the papacy, made no promises and maintained aloofness throughout the process</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pirie – Pius 09&quot;/&gt;Faced with deadlock and persuaded by Bernetti to keep Lambruschini from being elected pope, liberals and moderates decided to cast their votes for Mastai-Ferretti in a move that contradicted the general mood throughout Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>By the second day of the conclave, on 16 June 1846, during an evening ballot, Mastai-Ferretti was elected pope</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;He was a glamorous candidate, ardent, emotional with a gift for friendship and a track-record of generosity even towards anti-Clericals and [[Carbonari]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a patriot, known to be critical of [[Gregory XVI]] &quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Duffy 222&quot;/&gt; Because it was night, no formal announcement was given, just the signal of white smoke</span>
				<span class='text'>Many Catholics had assumed that Gizzi had been elected successor of St</span>
				<span class='text'>Peter</span>
				<span class='text'>In fact, celebrations began to take place in his hometown, and his personal staff, following a long-standing tradition, burned his cardinalitial vestments</span>
				<span class='text'>n the following morning, the [[protodeacon|senior Cardinal-Deacon]], Tommaso Riario Sforza, announced the election of Mastai-Ferretti before a crowd of faithful Catholics</span>
				<span class='text'>When Mastai-Ferretti appeared on the balcony, the mood became joyous</span>
				<span class='text'>Mastai-Ferretti chose the name of Pius IX in honor of [[Pope Pius VII]] (1800–23), who had encouraged his vocation to the priesthood despite his childhood [[epilepsy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>owever, Mastai-Ferretti, now Pope Pius IX, had little diplomatic and no curial experience at all, which did cause some controversy</span>
				<span class='text'>The government of the Empire of Austria as represented by [[Clemens von Metternich|Prince Metternich]] in its foreign affairs objected to even the possible election of Mastai-Ferretti</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, [[Cardinal Gaisruck]], [[Archbishop of Milan]], was sent to present the Austrian official [[Jus exclusivae|veto]] against Mastai-Ferretti</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Gaisruck arrived too late; the new Pope was already elected</span>

				<span class='text'>The ''Ambrosian Circle'' in Italy, the ''Union of Catholic Workers'' in France and the ''Pius Verein'' and the ''Deutsche Katholische Gesellschaft'' in Germany all tried to bring the Catholic faith in its fullness to people outside of the Church</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Franzen, 340&lt;/ref&gt; However, this decision, which he formulated as an infallible [[dogma]], raised a question: Can a pope make such decisions without the bishops?

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Franzen 340&quot;&gt;Franzen 340&lt;/ref&gt;  The Pope did consult the bishops beforehand with his encyclical ''[[Ubi primum (Pius IX, 1849)|Ubi primum]]'' (see below), but insisted on having this issue clarified nevertheless</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Franzen 340&quot;/&gt; The role of the bishops was to be dealt with at the Council, but it was disbanded because of the imminent attack by Italy against the Papal States</span>

				<span class='text'>Yet he was most popular with the faithful in all these countries, in many of which Pope Pius associations were formed in his support</span>

				<span class='text'>His other lasting contribution is the invocation of the [[ecumenical council]] [[First Vatican Council|Vatican One]], which promulgated the definition of Papal [[infallibility]]</span>
