				<span class='text'>His maternal great-uncle [[Julius Caesar]] was [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|assassinated]] in 44 BC, and Octavian was named in Caesar's will as his [[Adoption in ancient Rome|adopted]] son and heir</span>
				<span class='text'>He, [[Mark Antony]], and [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Lepidus]] formed the [[Second Triumvirate]] to defeat the assassins of Caesar</span>
				<span class='text'>Following their victory at [[Battle of Philippi|Philippi]], the Triumvirate divided the [[Roman Republic]] among themselves and ruled as [[military dictatorship|military dictators]]</span>

				<span class='text'>In reality, however, he retained his autocratic power over the Republic as a military dictator</span>
				<span class='text'>By law, Augustus held a collection of powers granted to him for life by the Senate, including [[commander-in-chief|supreme military command]], and those of [[tribune]] and [[Roman censor|censor]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It took several years for Augustus to develop the framework within which a formally republican state could be led under his sole rule</span>
				<span class='text'>He rejected monarchical titles, and instead called himself ''[[Princeps|Princeps Civitatis]]'' (&quot;First Citizen of the State&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>The resulting [[Constitution of the Roman Empire|constitutional framework]] became known as the [[Principate]], the first phase of the Roman Empire</span>
				<span class='text'>he reign of Augustus initiated an era of relative peace known as the ''[[Pax Romana]]'' (''The Roman Peace'')</span>
				<span class='text'>The Roman world was largely free from large-scale conflict for more than two centuries, despite continuous wars of imperial expansion on the Empire's frontiers and one [[Year of Four Emperors|year-long civil war]] over the imperial succession</span>
				<span class='text'>Augustus dramatically enlarged the Empire, annexing [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]], [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]], [[Pannonia]], [[Noricum]], and [[Raetia]]; expanding possessions in [[Africa Province|Africa]]; expanding into [[Germania]]; and completing the conquest of [[Hispania]]</span>
				<span class='text'>eyond the frontiers, he secured the Empire with a buffer region of [[client state]]s and made peace with the [[Parthian Empire]] through diplomacy</span>
				<span class='text'>He reformed the Roman system of taxation, developed [[Roman roads|networks of roads]] with an official [[courier]] system, established a standing army, established the [[Praetorian Guard]], created official [[Cohortes urbanae|police]] and [[Vigiles|fire-fighting services]] for Rome, and rebuilt much of the city during his reign</span>

				<span class='text'>3-94&lt;/ref&gt; and added '''Divi Filius''' (''Son of the Divine'') to his name in order to strengthen his political ties to Caesar's former soldiers by following the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|deification]] of Caesar, becoming '''Gaius Julius Caesar Divi Filius'''</span>
				<span class='text'> In 38 BC, Octavian replaced his ''[[praenomen]]'' &quot;Gaius&quot; and ''[[Roman naming conventions|nomen]]'' &quot;Julius&quot; with '''Imperator''', the [[Imperator|title by which troops hailed their leader after military success]], officially becoming '''Imperator Caesar Divi Filius'''</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;eck 11&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 11</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Octavian failed to persuade Antony to relinquish Caesar's money to him</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Syme (1939), 114‚Äì120</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Octavian began to make common cause with the [[Optimates]], the former enemies of Caesar</span>
				<span class='text'>In September, the leading Optimate orator [[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]] began to attack Antony in a [[Philippicae|series of speeches]] portraying him as a threat to the Republican order</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;eck 15&quot; /&gt; This explicit arrogation of special powers lasting five years was then supported by law passed by the [[plebs]], unlike the unofficial [[First Triumvirate]] formed by [[Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus |Pompey]], Julius Caesar, and [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The triumvirs then set in motion [[proscription]]s in which 300 senators and 2,000 ''[[Equestrian (Roman)|equites]]'' allegedly were branded as [[outlaw]]s and deprived of their property and, for those who failed to escape, their lives</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;eck 16&quot; /&gt;The estimation that 300 senators were proscribed was presented by [[Appian]], although his earlier contemporary [[Livy]] asserted that only 130 senators had been proscribed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Southern (1998), 52‚Äì53</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This decree issued by the triumvirate was motivated in part by a need to raise money to pay the salaries of their troops for the upcoming conflict against Caesar's assassins, [[Marcus Junius Brutus]] and [[Gaius Cassius Longinus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Scullard 1982 164&quot;&gt;Scullard (1982), 164</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;eck 16&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 16</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Contemporary Roman historians provide conflicting reports as to which triumvir was more responsible for the proscriptions and killing</span>
				<span class='text'> However, the sources agree that enacting the proscriptions was a means by all three factions to eliminate political enemies</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;scott 1933 19 20&quot;&gt;Scott (1933), 19‚Äì20</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcus Velleius Paterculus]] asserted that Octavian tried to avoid proscribing officials whereas Lepidus and Antony were to blame for initiating them</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;scott 1933 19&quot; /&gt; [[Cassius Dio]] defended Octavian as trying to spare as many as possible, whereas Antony and Lepidus, being older and involved in politics longer, had many more enemies to deal with</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;scott 1933 19&quot; /&gt;This claim was rejected by Appian, who maintained that Octavian shared an equal interest with Lepidus and Antony in eradicating his enemies</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;scott 1933 20&quot;&gt;Scott (1933), 20</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Suetonius presented the case that Octavian, although reluctant at first to proscribe officials, nonetheless pursued his enemies with more rigor than the other triumvirs</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;scott 1933 19 20&quot; /&gt; [[Plutarch]] described the proscriptions as a ruthless and cutthroat swapping of friends and family among Antony, Lepidus, and Octavian</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, Octavian allowed the proscription of his ally Cicero, Antony the proscription of his maternal uncle [[Lucius Julius Caesar (consul 64 BC)|Lucius Julius Caesar]] (the consul of 64 BC), and Lepidus his brother [[Lucius Aemilius Lepidus Paullus|Paullus]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;eck 17 18&quot; /&gt;After Philippi, a new territorial arrangement was made among the members of the Second Triumvirate</span>

				<span class='text'>This new conflict proved untenable for both Octavian and Antony, however</span>

				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|''Anthony and Cleopatra'', by [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]]]]Meanwhile, Antony's campaign turned disastrous against Parthia, tarnishing his image as a leader, and the mere 2,000 legionaries sent by Octavian to Antony were hardly enough to replenish his forces</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The breach between Antony and Octavian prompted a large portion of the Senators, as well as both of that year's consuls, to leave Rome and defect to Antony</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;eck 49&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 49</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;eck 49&quot; /&gt; According to Roman religious beliefs, the title symbolized a stamp of authority over humanity‚Äîand in fact nature‚Äîthat went beyond any constitutional definition of his status</span>
				<span class='text'>After the harsh methods employed in consolidating his control, the change in name served to demarcate his benign reign as Augustus from his reign of terror as Octavian</span>
				<span class='text'>His new title of Augustus was also more favorable than ''Romulus'', the previous one which he styled for himself in reference to the story of [[Romulus and Remus]] (founders of Rome), which symbolized a second founding of Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;eck 49&quot; /&gt; The title of ''Romulus'' was associated too strongly with notions of monarchy and kingship, an image that Octavian tried to avoid</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;eck 149&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 149&lt;/ref&gt; ''Princeps'' comes from the Latin phrase ''primum caput'', &quot;the first head&quot;, originally meaning the oldest or most distinguished senator whose name would appear first on the senatorial [[roster]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In the case of Augustus, however, it became an almost regnal title for a leader who was first in charge</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Eck (2003), 3, 149</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; ''Princeps'' had also been a title under the Republic for those who had served the state well; for example, Pompey had held the title</span>
				<span class='text'>Augustus also styled himself as ''Imperator Caesar divi filius'', &quot;Commander Caesar son of the deified one&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;eck 50&quot; /&gt; With this title, he boasted his familial link to deified Julius Caesar, and the use of ''[[Imperator]]'' signified a permanent link to the Roman tradition of victory</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;eck 50&quot; /&gt; The word ''Caesar'' was merely a cognomen for one branch of the [[Julius|Julian family]], yet Augustus transformed ''Caesar'' into a new family line that began with him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;eck 50&quot; /&gt;Augustus was granted the right to hang the ''[[corona civica]]'' above his door, the &quot;civic crown&quot; made from oak, and to have laurels drape his doorposts</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 24&quot;&gt;Eder (2005), 24</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This crown was usually held above the head of a Roman general during a [[Roman triumph|triumph]], with the individual holding the crown charged to continually repeat to the general &quot;''[[memento mori]]''&quot;, or &quot;Remember that you are mortal&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Additionally, laurel wreaths were important in several state ceremonies, and crowns of laurel were rewarded to champions of athletic, racing, and dramatic contests</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, both the laurel and the oak were integral symbols of Roman religion and statecraft; placing them on Augustus' doorposts was tantamount to declaring his home the capital</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Augustus renounced flaunting insignia of power such as holding a [[scepter]], wearing a [[diadem (personal wear)|diadem]], or wearing the golden crown and purple [[toga]] of his predecessor Julius Caesar</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 13&quot;&gt;Eder (2005), 13</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; If he refused to symbolize his power by donning and bearing these items on his person, the Senate nonetheless awarded him with a golden shield displayed in the meeting hall of the [[Curia]], bearing the inscription ''virtus'', ''pietas'', ''clementia'', ''iustitia''‚Äî&quot;valor, piety, clemency, and justice</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Davies, p</span>
				<span class='text'>259&quot; /&gt; This was a clever ploy by Augustus; his ceasing to perennially be one of two annual consuls allowed aspiring senators a better chance to fill that position, while at the same time Augustus could exercise wider patronage within the senatorial class</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 36&quot; /&gt; Although Augustus had resigned as consul, he desired to retain his consular ''[[imperium]]'' not just in his provinces but throughout the empire</span>
				<span class='text'>This desire, along with the Marcus Primus Affair, led to a second compromise between him and the Senate known as the Second Settlement</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;eck 57&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 57</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;=== Primary reasons for the Second settlement ===The primary reasons for the Second Settlement were as follows</span>
				<span class='text'>First, after Augustus relinquished the annual consulship, he was no longer in an official position to rule the state, yet his dominant position remained unchanged over his Roman, 'imperial' provinces where he was still a [[proconsul]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;eck 56&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 37&quot;&gt;Gruen (2005), 37</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; When he annually held the office of consul, he had the power to intervene with the affairs of the other provincial proconsuls appointed by the Senate throughout the empire, when he deemed necessary</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;eck 56 57&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 56‚Äì57</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; When he relinquished his annual consulship, he legally lost this power because his proconsular powers applied only to his imperial provinces</span>
				<span class='text'>Augustus wanted to keep this power</span>
				<span class='text'> second problem later arose showing the need for the Second Settlement in what became known as the &quot;Marcus Primus Affair&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>109; Holland, p</span>
				<span class='text'>299&lt;/ref&gt; In late 24 or early 23&amp;nbsp;BC, charges were brought against Marcus Primus, the former proconsul (governor) of Macedonia, for waging a war without prior approval of the Senate on the [[Odrysian]] kingdom of [[Thrace]], whose king was a Roman ally</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wells, p</span>
				<span class='text'>53&lt;/ref&gt; He was defended by [[Lucius Lucinius Varro Murena]], who told the trial that his client had received specific instructions from Augustus, ordering him to attack the client state</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, p</span>
				<span class='text'>108&quot;&gt;Southern, p</span>
				<span class='text'>108&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Primus testified that the orders came from the recently deceased Marcellus</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Holland, p</span>
				<span class='text'>300&lt;/ref&gt; Such orders, had they been given, would have been considered a breach of the Senate's prerogative under the Constitutional settlement of 27 BC and its aftermath ‚Äî i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> before Augustus was granted ''imperium proconsulare maius'' ‚Äî as Macedonia was a Senatorial province under the Senate's jurisdiction, not an imperial province under the authority of Augustus</span>
				<span class='text'>Such an action would have ripped away the veneer of Republican restoration as promoted by Augustus, and exposed his fraud of merely being the first citizen, a first among equals</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, p</span>
				<span class='text'>108&quot; /&gt; Even worse, the involvement of Marcellus provided some measure of proof that Augustus's policy was to have the youth take his place as Princeps, instituting a form of monarchy&amp;nbsp;‚Äì accusations that had already played out</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Stern, Gaius p</span>
				<span class='text'>23&quot; /&gt;The situation was so serious that Augustus himself appeared at the trial, even though he had not been called as a witness</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Syme, p</span>
				<span class='text'>333&lt;/ref&gt; Murena disbelieved Augustus's testimony and resented his attempt to subvert the trial by using his ''[[auctoritas]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>He rudely demanded to know why Augustus had turned up to a trial to which he had not been called; Augustus replied that he came in the public interest</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Syme, p</span>
				<span class='text'>333; Holland, p</span>
				<span class='text'>300; Southern, pg, 108&lt;/ref&gt; Although Primus was found guilty, some jurors voted to acquit, meaning that not everybody believed Augustus's testimony, an insult to the 'August One'</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wells, p</span>
				<span class='text'>53; Raaflaub, p</span>
				<span class='text'>426&lt;/ref&gt;The Second Constitutional Settlement was completed in part to allay confusion and formalize Augustus' legal authority to intervene in Senatorial provinces</span>
				<span class='text'>The Senate granted Augustus a form of general ''imperium proconsulare'', or proconsular imperium (power) that applied throughout the empire, not solely to his provinces</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, the Senate augmented Augustus' proconsular imperium into ''imperium proconsulare maius'', or proconsular imperium applicable throughout the empire that was more (maius) or greater than that held by the other proconsuls</span>
				<span class='text'>This in effect gave Augustus constitutional power superior to all other proconsuls in the empire</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;eck 57&quot; /&gt; Augustus stayed in Rome during the renewal process and provided veterans with lavish donations to gain their support, thereby ensuring that his status of proconsular imperium maius was renewed in 13&amp;nbsp;BC</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 26&quot; /&gt;=== Additional powers ===During the second settlement, Augustus was also granted the power of a [[tribune of the plebs|tribune]] (''tribunicia potestas'') for life, though not the official title of tribune</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;eck 57&quot; /&gt; For some years, Augustus had been awarded ''tribunicia sacrosanctitas'', or the immunity from physical attack given to a [[tribune of the plebs|Tribune of the Plebeians]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Now he decided to assume the full powers of the magistracy in perpetuity</span>
				<span class='text'>Legally, it was closed to [[Patrician (Ancient Rome)|patricians]], a status that Augustus had acquired some years earlier when adopted by Julius Caesar</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 36&quot;&gt;Gruen (2005), 36</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This power allowed him to convene the Senate and people at will and lay business before them, to veto the actions of either the Assembly or the Senate, to preside over elections, and to speak first at any meeting</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 26&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 57 58&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 57‚Äì58</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Also included in Augustus' tribunician authority were powers usually reserved for the [[Roman censor]]; these included the right to supervise public morals and scrutinize laws to ensure that they were in the public interest, as well as the ability to hold a [[census]] and determine the membership of the Senate</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;eck 59&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 59</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;With the powers of a censor, Augustus appealed to virtues of Roman patriotism by banning all attire but the classic toga while entering the Forum</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 30&quot;&gt;Eder (2005), 30</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; There was no precedent within the Roman system for combining the powers of the tribune and the censor into a single position, nor was Augustus ever elected to the office of censor</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 80&quot;&gt;Bunson (1994), 80</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Julius Caesar had been granted similar powers, wherein he was charged with supervising the morals of the state</span>
				<span class='text'>  However, this position did not extend to the censor's ability to hold a census and determine the Senate's roster</span>
				<span class='text'>The office of the ''tribunus plebis'' began to lose its prestige due to Augustus' amassing of tribunal powers, so he revived its importance by making it a mandatory appointment for any plebeian desiring the [[praetor]]ship</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 427&quot;&gt;Bunson (1994), 427</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;[[File:CaesarAugustusPontiusMaximusCloseup</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|upright|The ''[[Via Labicana Augustus]]''‚ÄîAugustus as [[Pontifex Maximus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>]Augustus was granted sole ''imperium'' within the city of Rome itself, in addition to being granted proconsular imperium maius and tribunician authority for life</span>
				<span class='text'>Traditionally, proconsuls (Roman province governors) lost their proconsular &quot;imperium&quot; when they crossed the Pomerium - the sacred boundary of Rome - and entered the city</span>
				<span class='text'>In these situations, Augustus would have power as part of his tribunician authority but his constitutional imperium within the Pomerium would be less than that of a serving consul</span>
				<span class='text'>That would mean that, when he was in the city, he might not be the constitutional magistrate with the most authority</span>
				<span class='text'>Thanks to his prestige or ''auctoritas'', his wishes would usually be obeyed, but there might be some difficulty</span>
				<span class='text'>To fill this power vacuum, the Senate voted that Augustus's imperium proconsulare maius (superior proconsular power) should not lapse when he was inside the city walls</span>
				<span class='text'>All armed forces in the city had formerly been under the control of the urban praetors and consuls, but this situation now placed them under the sole authority of Augustus</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;eck 60&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 60</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In addition, the credit was given to Augustus for each subsequent Roman military victory after this time, because the majority of Rome's armies were stationed in imperial provinces commanded by Augustus through the [[legatus]] who were deputies of the princeps in the provinces</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;eck 61&quot; /&gt; Moreover, if a battle was fought in a Senatorial province, Augustus' proconsular imperium maius allowed him to take command of (or credit for) any major military victory</span>
				<span class='text'>This meant that Augustus was the only individual able to receive a triumph, a tradition that began with Romulus, Rome's first King and first triumphant general</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;eck 61&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 61</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucius Cornelius Balbus the Younger|Lucius Cornelius Balbus]] was the last man outside Augustus' family to receive this award in 19&amp;nbsp;BC</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;eck 61&quot; /&gt; (Balbus was the nephew of Julius Caesar's great agent, who was governor of Africa and conqueror of the [[Garamantes]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;=== Conspiracy ===Many of the political subtleties of the Second Settlement seem to have evaded the comprehension of the Plebeian class, who were Augustus' greatest supporters and clientele</span>
				<span class='text'>This caused them to insist upon Augustus' participation in imperial affairs from time to time</span>
				<span class='text'>Augustus failed to stand for election as consul in 22&amp;nbsp;BC, and fears arose once again that he was being forced from power by the aristocratic Senate</span>
				<span class='text'>In 22, 21, and 19&amp;nbsp;BC, the people rioted in response, and only allowed a single consul to be elected for each of those years, ostensibly to leave the other position open for Augustus</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, there was a food shortage in Rome in 22&amp;nbsp;BC which sparked panic, while many urban plebs called for Augustus to take on dictatorial powers to personally oversee the crisis</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 26&quot; /&gt; After a theatrical display of refusal before the Senate, Augustus finally accepted authority over Rome's grain supply &quot;by virtue of his proconsular ''imperium''&quot;, and ended the crisis almost immediately</span>

				<span class='text'>The conspirators were tried in absentia with Tiberius acting as prosecutor; the jury found them guilty, but it was not a unanimous verdict</span>

				<span class='text'>301&lt;/ref&gt; Augustus ensured that the facade of Republican government continued with an effective cover-up of the events</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Holland, p</span>
				<span class='text'>301&lt;/ref&gt;In 19&amp;nbsp;BC, the Senate granted Augustus a form of 'general consular imperium', which was probably 'imperium consulare maius', like the proconsular powers that he received in 23 BC</span>
				<span class='text'>Like his tribune authority, the consular powers were another instance of gaining power from offices that he did not actually hold</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 43&quot; /&gt; In addition, Augustus was allowed to wear the consul's insignia in public and before the Senate,&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 60&quot; /&gt; as well as to sit in the symbolic chair between the two consuls and hold the [[fasces]], an emblem of consular authority</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 43&quot;&gt;Gruen (2005), 43</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This seems to have assuaged the populace; regardless of whether or not Augustus was a consul, the importance was that he both appeared as one before the people and could exercise consular power if necessary</span>
				<span class='text'>On 6 March 12&amp;nbsp;BC, after the death of [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Lepidus]], he additionally took up the position of pontifex maximus, the high priest of the collegium of the Pontifices, the most important position in Roman religion</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;=== Stability and staying power ===A final reason for the Second Settlement was to give the Principate constitutional stability and staying power in case something happened to Princeps Augustus</span>
				<span class='text'>His illness of early 23 BC and the Caepio conspiracy showed that the regime's existence hung by the thin thread of the life of one man, Augustus himself, who suffered from several severe and dangerous illnesses throughout his life</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; If he were to die from natural causes or fall victim to assassination, Rome could be subjected to another round of civil war</span>
				<span class='text'>The memories of Pharsalus, the Ides of March, the proscriptions, Philippi, and Actium, barely twenty-five years distant, were still vivid in the minds of many citizens</span>
				<span class='text'>Proconsular imperium was conferred upon [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] for five years, similar to Augustus' power, in order to accomplish this constitutional stability</span>
				<span class='text'>The exact nature of the grant is uncertain but it probably covered Augustus' imperial provinces, east and west, perhaps lacking authority over the provinces of the Senate</span>
				<span class='text'>That came later, as did the jealously guarded tribunicia potestas</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Syme (1939), 337-338</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Augustus' powers were now complete</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Everett (2006), 217</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Almost as importantly, the Principate now had constitutional stability</span>
				<span class='text'>Later Roman Emperors were generally limited to the powers and titles originally granted to Augustus, though often newly appointed Emperors would decline one or more of the honorifics given to Augustus in order to display humility</span>
				<span class='text'>Just as often, as their reign progressed, Emperors would appropriate all of the titles, regardless of whether they had been granted them by the Senate</span>
				<span class='text'>Later Emperors took to wearing the civic crown, consular insignia, and the purple robes of a Triumphant general (''[[toga picta]]''), which became the imperial insignia well into the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] era</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;rowell 13&quot;&gt;Rowell (1962), 13</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Victory in battle was not always a permanent success, as newly conquered territories were constantly retaken by Rome's enemies in Germania</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;eck 96&quot; /&gt;A prime example of Roman loss in battle was the [[Battle of Teutoburg Forest]] in AD 9, where three entire legions led by [[Publius Quinctilius Varus]] were destroyed by [[Arminius]], leader of the [[Cherusci]], an apparent Roman ally</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;eck 101 102&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 101‚Äì102</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 417&quot;&gt;Bunson (1994), 417</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bunson 31&quot;&gt;Bunson (1994), 31</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;== Death and succession ==The illness of Augustus in 23&amp;nbsp;BC brought the problem of succession to the forefront of political issues and the public</span>
				<span class='text'>To ensure stability, he needed to designate an heir to his unique position in Roman society and government</span>
				<span class='text'>This was to be achieved in small, undramatic, and incremental ways that did not stir senatorial fears of monarchy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 50&quot; /&gt; If someone was to succeed Augustus' unofficial position of power, he would have to earn it through his own publicly proven merits</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 50&quot;&gt;Gruen (2005), 50</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Some Augustan historians argue that indications pointed toward his sister's son [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus (Julio-Claudian dynasty)|Marcellus]], who had been quickly married to Augustus' daughter [[Julia the Elder]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;eck 114 115&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 114‚Äì115</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Other historians dispute this due to Augustus' will read aloud to the Senate while he was seriously ill in 23&amp;nbsp;BC,&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 115&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 115</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; instead indicating a preference for Marcus Agrippa, who was Augustus' second in charge and arguably the only one of his associates who could have controlled the legions and held the Empire together</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 44&quot; /&gt;After the death of Marcellus in 23&amp;nbsp;BC, Augustus married his daughter to Agrippa</span>
				<span class='text'>This union produced five children, three sons and two daughters: [[Gaius Caesar]], [[Lucius Caesar]], [[Vipsania Julia]], [[Agrippina the Elder]], and [[Agrippa Postumus|Postumus Agrippa]], so named because he was born after Marcus Agrippa died</span>
				<span class='text'>Shortly after the Second Settlement, Agrippa was granted a five-year term of administering the eastern half of the Empire with the ''imperium'' of a proconsul and the same ''tribunicia potestas'' granted to Augustus (although not trumping Augustus' authority), his seat of governance stationed at [[Samos]] in the eastern [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 58&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 58</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This granting of power showed Augustus' favor for Agrippa, but it was also a measure to please members of his Caesarian party by allowing one of their members to share a considerable amount of power with him</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Augustus also showed favor to his stepsons, Livia's children from her first marriage [[Nero Claudius Drusus Germanicus]] (henceforth referred to as Drusus) and [[Tiberius|Tiberius Claudius]] (henceforth Tiberius), granting them military commands and public office, though seeming to favor Drusus</span>
				<span class='text'>After Agrippa died in 12&amp;nbsp;BC, Tiberius was ordered to divorce his own wife Vipsania and marry Agrippa's widow, Augustus' daughter Julia&amp;nbsp;‚Äî as soon as a period of mourning for Agrippa had ended</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; No specific reason is known for his departure, though it could have been a combination of reasons, including a failing marriage with Julia,&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 117&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 46&quot; /&gt; as well as a sense of envy and exclusion over Augustus' apparent favouring of his young grandchildren-turned-sons Gaius and Lucius</span>

				<span class='text'>]]&lt;/ref&gt; Had Augustus died earlier (in 23&amp;nbsp;BC, for instance), matters might have turned out differently</span>
				<span class='text'>The attrition of the civil wars on the old Republican oligarchy and the longevity of Augustus, therefore, must be seen as major contributing factors in the transformation of the Roman state into a [[de facto]] monarchy in these years</span>
				<span class='text'>Augustus' own experience, his patience, his tact, and his political acumen also played their parts</span>
				<span class='text'>He directed the future of the Empire down many lasting paths, from the existence of a standing professional army stationed at or near the frontiers, to the dynastic principle so often employed in the imperial succession, to the embellishment of the capital at the emperor's expense</span>
				<span class='text'>Augustus' ultimate legacy was the peace and prosperity the Empire enjoyed for the next two centuries under the system he initiated</span>
				<span class='text'>His memory was enshrined in the political ethos of the Imperial age as a paradigm of the good emperor</span>
				<span class='text'>Every Emperor of Rome adopted his name, Caesar Augustus, which gradually lost its character as a name and eventually became a title</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;eck 124&quot; /&gt; The Augustan era poets Virgil and Horace praised Augustus as a defender of Rome, an upholder of moral justice, and an individual who bore the brunt of responsibility in maintaining the empire</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;However, for his rule of Rome and establishing the principate, Augustus has also been subjected to criticism throughout the ages</span>
				<span class='text'>The contemporary Roman jurist [[Marcus Antistius Labeo]] (d</span>
				<span class='text'>AD 10/11), fond of the days of pre-Augustan republican [[liberty]] in which he had been born, openly criticized the Augustan regime</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;starr 5&quot;&gt;Starr (1952), 5</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning of his ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'', the Roman historian [[Tacitus]] (c</span>
				<span class='text'>56‚Äìc</span>
				<span class='text'>17) wrote that Augustus had cunningly subverted Republican Rome into a position of slavery</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;starr 5&quot; /&gt; He continued to say that, with Augustus' death and swearing of loyalty to Tiberius, the people of Rome simply traded one slaveholder for another</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;starr 5&quot; /&gt; Tacitus, however, records two contradictory but common views of Augustus:[[File:0005MAN-OctAugusto</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|Fragment of a bronze equestrian statue of Augustus, 1st century AD]]{{quote|Intelligent people praised or criticized him in varying ways</span>
				<span class='text'>One opinion was as follows</span>

				<span class='text'>He had made many concessions to Anthony and to Lepidus for the sake of vengeance on his father's murderers</span>
				<span class='text'>When Lepidus grew old and lazy, and Anthony's self-indulgence got the better of him, the only possible cure for the distracted country had been government by one man</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Augustus had put the state in order not by making himself king or dictator, but by creating the Principate</span>
				<span class='text'>The Empire's frontiers were on the ocean, or distant rivers</span>
				<span class='text'>Armies, provinces, fleets, the whole system was interrelated</span>

				<span class='text'>The story of his career shows that Augustus was indeed ruthless, cruel, and ambitious for himself</span>
				<span class='text'>This was only in part a personal trait, for upper-class Romans were educated to compete with one another and to excel</span>
				<span class='text'>However, he combined an overriding concern for his personal interests with a deep-seated patriotism, based on a nostalgia of Rome's antique virtues</span>
				<span class='text'>In his capacity as ''princeps'', selfishness and selflessness coexisted in his mind</span>
				<span class='text'>While fighting for dominance, he paid little attention to legality or to the normal civilities of political life</span>
				<span class='text'>He was devious, untrustworthy, and bloodthirsty</span>
				<span class='text'>But once he had established his authority, he governed efficiently and justly, generally allowed freedom of speech, and promoted the rule of law</span>
				<span class='text'>He was immensely hardworking and tried as hard as any [[Democracy in Ancient Rome|democratic]] parliamentarian to treat his senatorial colleagues with respect and sensitivity</span>
				<span class='text'>He suffered from no delusions of grandeur</span>

				<span class='text'>[[British Museum]]]]Augustus' public [[revenue]] reforms had a great impact on the subsequent success of the Empire</span>
				<span class='text'>Augustus brought a far greater portion of the Empire's expanded land base under consistent, direct taxation from Rome, instead of exacting varying, intermittent, and somewhat arbitrary tributes from each local province as Augustus' predecessors had done</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;eck 83 84&quot; /&gt; This reform greatly increased Rome's net revenue from its territorial acquisitions, stabilized its flow, and regularized the financial relationship between Rome and the provinces, rather than provoking fresh resentments with each new arbitrary exaction of tribute</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;eck 83 84&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 83‚Äì84</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The measures of taxation in the reign of Augustus were determined by population census, with fixed quotas for each province</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 404&quot;&gt;Bunson (1994), 404</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Citizens of Rome and Italy paid indirect taxes, while direct taxes were exacted from the provinces</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 404&quot; /&gt; Indirect taxes included a 4% tax on the price of slaves, a 1% tax on goods sold at auction, and a 5% tax on the inheritance of estates valued at over 100,000 sesterces by persons other than the [[next of kin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 404&quot; /&gt;An equally important reform was the abolition of private [[tax farming]], which was replaced by salaried civil service tax collectors</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;eck 83 84&quot; /&gt; The tax farmers had gained great infamy for their depredations, as well as great private wealth, by winning the right to tax local areas</span>
