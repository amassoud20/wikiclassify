				<span class='text'>426 The Second Constitutional Settlement was completed in part to allay confusion and formalize Augustus legal authority to intervene in Senatorial provinces</span>
				<span class='text'>The Senate granted Augustus a form of general imperium proconsulare or proconsular imperium power that applied throughout the empire not solely to his provinces</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover the Senate augmented Augustus proconsular imperium into imperium proconsulare maius or proconsular imperium applicable throughout the empire that was more maius or greater than that held by the other proconsuls</span>
				<span class='text'>This in effect gave Augustus constitutional power superior to all other proconsuls in the empire</span>
				<span class='text'>name eck 57   Augustus stayed in Rome during the renewal process and provided veterans with lavish donations to gain their support thereby ensuring that his status of proconsular imperium maius was renewed in 13ampnbspBC</span>
				<span class='text'>name ccaa 26  During the second settlement Augustus was also granted the power of a  tribunicia potestas for life though not the official title of tribune</span>
				<span class='text'>name eck 57   For some years Augustus had been awarded tribunicia sacrosanctitas or the immunity from physical attack given to a </span>
				<span class='text'>Now he decided to assume the full powers of the magistracy in perpetuity</span>
				<span class='text'>Legally it was closed to  a status that Augustus had acquired some years earlier when adopted by Julius Caesar</span>
				<span class='text'>name ccaa 36Gruen 2005 36</span>
				<span class='text'> This power allowed him to convene the Senate and people at will and lay business before them to veto the actions of either the Assembly or the Senate to preside over elections and to speak first at any meeting</span>

				<span class='text'>name eck 59Eck 2003 59</span>
				<span class='text'>With the powers of a censor Augustus appealed to virtues of Roman patriotism by banning all attire but the classic toga while entering the Forum</span>
				<span class='text'>name ccaa 30Eder 2005 30</span>
				<span class='text'> There was no precedent within the Roman system for combining the powers of the tribune and the censor into a single position nor was Augustus ever elected to the office of censor</span>
				<span class='text'>name bunson 80Bunson 1994 80</span>
				<span class='text'> Julius Caesar had been granted similar powers wherein he was charged with supervising the morals of the state</span>
				<span class='text'>  However this position did not extend to the censors ability to hold a census and determine the Senates roster</span>
				<span class='text'>The office of the tribunus plebis began to lose its prestige due to Augustus amassing of tribunal powers so he revived its importance by making it a mandatory appointment for any plebeian desiring the ship</span>
				<span class='text'>name bunson 427Bunson 1994 427</span>
				<span class='text'>Augustus was granted sole imperium within the city of Rome itself in addition to being granted proconsular imperium maius and tribunician authority for life</span>
				<span class='text'>Traditionally proconsuls Roman province governors lost their proconsular imperium when they crossed the Pomerium   the sacred boundary of Rome   and entered the city</span>
				<span class='text'>In these situations Augustus would have power as part of his tribunician authority but his constitutional imperium within the Pomerium would be less than that of a serving consul</span>
				<span class='text'>That would mean that when he was in the city he might not be the constitutional magistrate with the most authority</span>
				<span class='text'>Thanks to his prestige or auctoritas his wishes would usually be obeyed but there might be some difficulty</span>
				<span class='text'>To fill this power vacuum the Senate voted that Augustuss imperium proconsulare maius superior proconsular power should not lapse when he was inside the city walls</span>
				<span class='text'>All armed forces in the city had formerly been under the control of the urban praetors and consuls but this situation now placed them under the sole authority of Augustus</span>
				<span class='text'>name eck 60Eck 2003 60</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition the credit was given to Augustus for each subsequent Roman military victory after this time because the majority of Romes armies were stationed in imperial provinces commanded by Augustus through the  who were deputies of the princeps in the provinces</span>
				<span class='text'>name eck 61   Moreover if a battle was fought in a Senatorial province Augustus proconsular imperium maius allowed him to take command of or credit for any major military victory</span>
				<span class='text'>This meant that Augustus was the only individual able to receive a triumph a tradition that began with Romulus Romes first King and first triumphant general</span>
				<span class='text'>name eck 61Eck 2003 61</span>

				<span class='text'>Many of the political subtleties of the Second Settlement seem to have evaded the comprehension of the Plebeian class who were Augustus greatest supporters and clientele</span>
				<span class='text'>This caused them to insist upon Augustus participation in imperial affairs from time to time</span>
				<span class='text'>Augustus failed to stand for election as consul in 22ampnbspBC and fears arose once again that he was being forced from power by the aristocratic Senate</span>
				<span class='text'>In 22 21 and 19ampnbspBC the people rioted in response and only allowed a single consul to be elected for each of those years ostensibly to leave the other position open for Augustus</span>

				<span class='text'> Likewise there was a food shortage in Rome in 22ampnbspBC which sparked panic while many urban plebs called for Augustus to take on dictatorial powers to personally oversee the crisis</span>
				<span class='text'>name ccaa 26   After a theatrical display of usal before the Senate Augustus finally accepted authority over Romes grain supply by virtue of his proconsular imperium and ended the crisis almost immediately</span>

				<span class='text'>Nevertheless there were some who were concerned by the expansion of powers granted to Augustus by the Second Settlement and this came to a head with the apparent conspiracy of Fannius Caepio</span>

				<span class='text'>olland p</span>
				<span class='text'>301 In 19ampnbspBC the Senate granted Augustus a form of general consular imperium which was probably imperium consulare maius like the proconsular powers that he received in 23 BC</span>
				<span class='text'>Like his tribune authority the consular powers were another instance of gaining power from offices that he did not actually hold</span>

				<span class='text'> This seems to have assuaged the populace regardless of whether or not Augustus was a consul the importance was that he both appeared as one before the people and could exercise consular power if necessary</span>

				<span class='text'>Proconsular imperium was conferred upon  for five years similar to Augustus power in order to accomplish this constitutional stability</span>

				<span class='text'> Almost as importantly the Principate now had constitutional stability</span>
				<span class='text'>Later Roman Emperors were generally limited to the powers and titles originally granted to Augustus though often newly appointed Emperors would decline one or more of the honorifics given to Augustus in order to display humility</span>
				<span class='text'>Just as often as their reign progressed Emperors would appropriate all of the titles regardless of whether they had been granted them by the Senate</span>
