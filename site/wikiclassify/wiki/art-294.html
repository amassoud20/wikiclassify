				<span class='text'>n his second day in office, Carter pardoned all evaders of the [[Vietnam War]] drafts</span>
				<span class='text'>During his term as President, Carter created two new cabinet-level departments, the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] and the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He established a [[Energy policy of the United States|national energy policy]] that included conservation, price control, and new technology</span>
				<span class='text'>In foreign affairs, Carter pursued the [[Camp David Accords]], the [[Panama Canal Treaties]], the second round of [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]] (SALT II), and the return of the [[Panama Canal Zone]] to Panama</span>
				<span class='text'>On the economic front he confronted  persistent [[stagnation and inflation|&quot;stagflation&quot;]], a combination of high inflation, high unemployment and slow growth</span>
				<span class='text'>The end of his presidential tenure was marked by the 1979–1981 [[Iran hostage crisis]], the [[1979 energy crisis]], the [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island nuclear accident]], and the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]]</span>

				<span class='text'>He has also traveled extensively to conduct peace negotiations, observe elections, and advance disease prevention and [[Eradication of infectious diseases|eradication]] in developing nations</span>
				<span class='text'>Additionally, Carter is a key figure in the [[Habitat for Humanity]] project</span>
				<span class='text'>Regarding current political views, he has criticized of some of Israel's actions and policies in regards to the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Numerous generations of Carters lived as cotton farmers in Georgia</span>
				<span class='text'>Established in [[Sumter County, Georgia|Sumter County]], Plains was a [[boomtown]] of 600 people when Carter was born</span>
				<span class='text'>Carter's father, [[James Earl Carter, Sr</span>
				<span class='text'>], was a successful local businessman who ran a general store and had begun to invest in farmland</span>
				<span class='text'>He had been a reserve second lieutenant in the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Army's [[Quartermaster Corps (United States Army)|Quartermaster Corps]] during [[World War I]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Carter's mother, [[Bessie Lillian Gordy]], was a nurse at the Wise hospital</span>

				<span class='text'>11–32</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The Carters settled on a dirt road in nearby Archery, which was almost entirely populated by impoverished [[African American]] families</span>
				<span class='text'>They eventually had three more children—[[Gloria Carter Spann|Gloria]], [[Ruth Carter Stapleton|Ruth]], and [[Billy Carter|Billy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Carter got along well with his parents, although his mother worked long hours and was often absent in his childhood</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Earl was staunchly pro-segregation, he allowed his son to befriend the black farmhands' children</span>
				<span class='text'>An enterprising teenager, Carter was given his own acre of Earl's farmland where he grew, packaged, and sold peanuts</span>
				<span class='text'>Carter also rented out a section of tenant housing he had purchased</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;bourne-11-32&quot; /&gt;Carter attended the Plains High School from 1930, first grade, to 1941</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] had by then impoverished Archery and Plains, but the family benefited from [[New Deal]] farming subsidies, and Earl took a position as a community leader</span>
				<span class='text'>Young Carter was a diligent student with a fondness for reading</span>
				<span class='text'>{refn|A popular anecdote holds that he was passed over for [[valedictorian]] after he and his friends skipped school to venture downtown in a [[hot rod]]</span>

				<span class='text'>As an adolescent, Carter played on the Plains High School basketball team; he also joined the [[Future Farmers of America]] and developed a lifelong interest in woodworking</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;bourne-33-43&quot; /&gt;==Naval career==Carter had long dreamed of attending the [[United States Naval Academy|U</span>

				<span class='text'> He initially started undergraduate coursework in engineering at [[Georgia Southwestern College]] in nearby [[Americus, Georgia|Americus]] in 1941, transferred to [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] in Atlanta in 1942, and finally achieved admission to the Naval Academy in 1943</span>
				<span class='text'>With his diminutive stature, Carter barely met the minimum physical requirements for entry</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a good student but was seen as reserved and quiet, in contrast to the academy's culture of aggressive hazing of freshmen</span>
				<span class='text'>While at the academy, Carter fell in love with his sister Ruth's friend Rosalynn Smith, whom he would marry shortly after his graduation in 1946</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bourne, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>44–55</span>

				<span class='text'>for three month temporary duty, while Rosalynn moved with their children to Schenectady, New York</span>
				<span class='text'> On December 12, 1952, an accident with the experimental NRX reactor at [[Atomic Energy of Canada]]'s [[Chalk River Laboratories]] caused a partial meltdown resulting in millions of liters of radioactive water to flood the reactor building's basement and leaving the reactor's core ruined</span>

				<span class='text'>nuclear submarines, at the [[Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory]]  which supports the  U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>naval nuclear propulsion program</span>
				<span class='text'> In March 1953 he began nuclear power school, a six-month non-credit course covering nuclear power plant operation at [[Union College]] in Schenectady&lt;ref name=&quot;zelizer-11&quot; /&gt; and would lead to becoming an engineering officer for a nuclear power plant</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;naval service&quot; /&gt;  But in July his father died and the family business became his</span>
				<span class='text'> Deciding to leave Schenectady proved difficult</span>
				<span class='text'> Settling after moving so much Rosalynn had grown comfortable with their life</span>
				<span class='text'> Returning to small-town life in Plains seemed &quot;a monumental step backward,&quot; she said later</span>
				<span class='text'> On the other hand, Carter felt restricted by the rigidity of the military and yearned to assume a path more like his father's</span>
				<span class='text'> Thus resigning his commission, Carter was honorably discharged from the Navy on October 9, 1953</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Farming==Earl Carter died a relatively wealthy man, having also recently been elected to the [[Georgia House of Representatives]]</span>
				<span class='text'>However, between his forgiveness of debts and the division of his wealth among heirs, his son Jimmy inherited comparatively little</span>
				<span class='text'>For a year, Jimmy, Rosalynn, and their three sons lived in [[public housing]] in Plains; Carter is the only U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>president to have lived in housing subsidized for the poor</span>
				<span class='text'>Knowledgeable in scientific and technological subjects, however, Carter set out to expand the family's peanut-growing business</span>
				<span class='text'>The transition from Navy to agribusinessman was difficult, as the harvest his first year failed due to drought; Carter was compelled to open several bank lines of credit to keep the farm afloat</span>
				<span class='text'>Meanwhile, he also took classes and read up on agriculture while Rosalynn learned accounting to manage the business's books</span>
				<span class='text'>Though they barely broke even the first year, the Carters grew the business and became quite successful</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Supreme Court]]'s anti-segregation ruling in ''[[Brown v</span>
				<span class='text'>Board of Education]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Carter was in favor of racial tolerance and integration—at one point, the local [[Citizens' Councils|White Citizens' Council]] boycotted his peanut warehouse when he refused to join them—but he often kept those feelings to himself to avoid making enemies</span>
				<span class='text'>By 1961 he was a prominent member of the community and the Baptist Church as well as chairman of the Sumter County school board, where he began to speak more loudly in favor of school integration</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bourne, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>92–108</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; A [[Georgia Senate|state Senate]] seat was opened by the dissolution of Georgia's [[County Unit System]] in 1962; Carter announced his run for the seat 15 days before the election</span>
				<span class='text'>Rosalynn, who had an instinct for politics and organization, was instrumental to his campaign</span>
				<span class='text'>The initial results showed Carter losing, but this was the result of fraudulent voting orchestrated by Joe Hurst, the sheriff of [[Quitman County, Georgia|Quitman County]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Carter challenged the results; when fraud was confirmed, a new election was held, which he won</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bourne, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>108–132</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1954–68)|Civil Rights Movement]] was well underway as Carter took office</span>
				<span class='text'>He and his family had become staunch [[John F</span>
				<span class='text'>Kennedy]] supporters</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1962, the town of Americus was the site of mass beatings and incarcerations of black protesters, echoing similar unrest throughout the country</span>
				<span class='text'>Carter remained relatively quiet on the issue at first, even as it polarized much of the county, to avoid alienating his segregationist colleagues</span>
				<span class='text'>He did speak up on a few divisive issues, giving speeches against [[literacy tests]] and against a change to the Georgia Constitution which, he felt, implied a compulsion to practice religion</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bourne, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>132–140</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; A diligent legislator, Carter took speed-reading courses to keep up with the workload</span>
				<span class='text'>Within two years his connections landed him on the state Democratic Executive Committee, where he helped rewrite the state party's rules</span>
				<span class='text'>He became chairman of the West Central Georgia Planning and Development Commission, which oversaw the disbursement of federal and state grants for projects such as historic site restoration</span>
				<span class='text'>When [[Bo Callaway]] was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives|U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>House of Representatives]] in November 1964, Carter immediately began planning to unseat him</span>
				<span class='text'>The two had previously clashed over which two-year college would be expanded to a four-year college program by the state; Carter wanted it to go to [[Georgia Southwestern College]] in Americus, but Callaway wanted the funding to go to downtown [[Columbus, Georgia|Columbus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Carter saw Callaway, a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], as a rival who represented the inherited wealth and selfishness he despised in politics</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bourne, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>132–145</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Carter was re-elected in 1964 to serve a second two-year term</span>
				<span class='text'>For a time in the State Senate, he chaired its Education Committee; he also sat on the Appropriations Committee toward the end of his second term</span>
				<span class='text'>Before his term ended he contributed to a bill expanding statewide education funding and getting Georgia Southwestern a four-year program</span>
				<span class='text'>He leveraged his regional planning work, giving speeches around the district to make himself more visible to potential voters</span>
				<span class='text'>The last day of the term, he announced his run for Congress</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bourne, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>145–149</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===1966 and 1970 campaigns for governor==={{See also|Georgia gubernatorial election, 1966|Georgia gubernatorial election, 1970}}The congressional race was shaken up in mid-May when Callaway dropped out and decided to run for Governor of Georgia instead</span>
				<span class='text'>Callaway was a very strong candidate, and state Democrats panicked over the prospect of losing the governorship they had held since [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Carter soon decided to follow Callaway and run for governor himself</span>
				<span class='text'>In the Democratic primary he ran as a moderate alternative to both the liberal former governor [[Ellis Arnall]] and the conservative [[Lester Maddox]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In a press conference he described his ideology as &quot;Conservative, moderate, liberal and middle-of-the-road</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;</span>

				<span class='text'>I believe I am a more complicated person than that</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bourne, pp</span>

				<span class='text'>While he met with black figures such as [[Martin Luther King, Sr</span>
				<span class='text'>] and [[Andrew Young]], and visited many black-owned businesses, he also praised Wallace and promised to invite him to give a speech in Georgia</span>
				<span class='text'>He implied support or dislike of private schools depending on the audience</span>
				<span class='text'>The appeal to racism became more blatant over time; Carter's senior campaign aides handed out a photograph of his opponent Sanders celebrating with black basketball players</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;bourne-180&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hayward-46&quot; /&gt;That September, Carter came ahead of Sanders in the first ballot by 49 to 38 percent, leading to a runoff</span>

				<span class='text'>] Carter won the runoff election with 60 percent of the vote—winning 7 percent of the black vote—and went on to win the general election easily over the Republican [[Hal Suit]], a local news anchor</span>
				<span class='text'>Once he was elected, Carter began to speak confidently against Georgia's racist politics</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Leroy Johnson (senator)|Leroy Johnson]], a black state Senator, voiced his support for Carter, saying, &quot;I understand why he ran that kind of ultra-conservative campaign</span>

				<span class='text'>quot; Carter stated:{{quote|The truth is that male religious leaders have had—and still have—an option to interpret holy teachings either to exalt or subjugate women</span>
				<span class='text'>They have, for their own selfish ends, overwhelmingly chosen the latter</span>
				<span class='text'>Their continuing choice provides the foundation or justification for much of the pervasive persecution and abuse of women throughout the world</span>
