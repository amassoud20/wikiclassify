				<span class='text'>Though her personal contact with Alfred Nobel had been brief, she corresponded with him until his death in 1896, and it is believed that she was a major influence in his decision to include a peace prize among those prizes provided in his will</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Bertha von Suttner]] was awarded the 1905 Nobel Peace prize, 'for her sincere peace activities'</span>
				<span class='text'>obel's third and longest-lasting relationship was with Sofie Hess from [[Vienna]], whom he met in 1876</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Portrait of Nobel by Gösta Florman (1831–1900)]]Nobel found that when [[nitroglycerin]] was incorporated in an absorbent inert substance like ''kieselguhr'' ([[diatomaceous earth]]) it became safer and more convenient to handle, and this mixture he patented in 1867 as 'dynamite'</span>
				<span class='text'>Nobel demonstrated his explosive for the first time that year, at a quarry in [[Redhill, Surrey|Redhill]], [[Surrey]], England</span>
				<span class='text'>In order to help reestablish his name and improve the image of his business from the earlier controversies associated with the dangerous explosives, Nobel had also considered naming the highly powerful substance &quot;Nobel's Safety Powder&quot;, but settled with Dynamite instead, referring to the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for 'power' (''δύναμις'')</span>
				<span class='text'>obel later on combined nitroglycerin with various nitrocellulose compounds, similar to [[collodion]], but settled on a more efficient recipe combining another nitrate explosive, and obtained a transparent, jelly-like substance, which was a more powerful explosive than dynamite</span>
				<span class='text'>'[[Gelignite]]', or blasting gelatin, as it was named, was patented in 1876; and was followed by a host of similar combinations, modified by the addition of potassium nitrate and various other substances</span>
				<span class='text'>Gelignite was more stable, transportable and conveniently formed to fit into bored holes, like those used in drilling and mining, than the previously used compounds and was adopted as the standard technology for mining in the ''Age of Engineering'' bringing Nobel a great amount of financial success, though at a significant cost to his health</span>
				<span class='text'>An offshoot of this research resulted in Nobel's invention of [[ballistite]], the precursor of many modern smokeless powder explosives and still used as a rocket propellant</span>
				<span class='text'>=Nobel Prizes=={{Main|Nobel Prize}}In 1888 Alfred's brother Ludvig died while visiting [[Cannes]] and a [[France|French]] newspaper erroneously published Alfred's [[List of premature obituaries|obituary]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{r|Brit1}} It condemned him for his invention of dynamite and is said to have brought about his decision to leave a better legacy after his death</span>
				<span class='text'>{r|Brit1}}{{r|HistC}} The obituary stated, ''{{lang|fr|Le marchand de la mort est mort}}'' (&quot;The merchant of death is dead&quot;){{r|Brit1}} and went on to say, &quot;Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Alfred Nobel, who became rich by finding ways to kill more people faster than ever before, died yesterday</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{r|Nobel}} Alfred (who never had a wife or children) was disappointed with what he read and concerned with how he would be remembered</span>
				<span class='text'>n 27 November 1895, at the [[Sweden|Swedish]]-[[Norway|Norwegian]] Club in Paris, Nobel signed his last will and testament and set aside the bulk of his estate to establish the [[Nobel Prize]]s, to be awarded annually without distinction of nationality</span>
				<span class='text'>After taxes and bequests to individuals, Nobel's will allocated 94% of his total assets, 31,225,000 [[Swedish kronor]], to establish the five Nobel Prizes</span>
				<span class='text'>This converted to £1,687,837 (GBP) at the time</span>

				<span class='text'>he formulation for the literary prize being given for a work &quot;in an ideal direction&quot; (''{{lang|sv|i idealisk riktning}}'' in Swedish), is cryptic and has caused much confusion</span>
				<span class='text'>For many years, the Swedish Academy interpreted &quot;ideal&quot; as &quot;idealistic&quot; (''{{lang|sv|idealistisk}}'') and used it as a reason not to give the prize to important but less romantic authors, such as [[Henrik Ibsen]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This interpretation has since been revised, and the prize has been awarded to, for example, [[Dario Fo]] and [[José Saramago]], who do not belong to the camp of literary idealism</span>
				<span class='text'>here was room for interpretation by the bodies he had named for deciding on the physical sciences and chemistry prizes, given that he had not consulted them before making the will</span>
				<span class='text'>In his one-page testament, he stipulated that the money go to discoveries or inventions in the physical sciences and to discoveries or improvements in chemistry</span>
				<span class='text'>He had opened the door to technological awards, but had not left instructions on how to deal with the distinction between science and technology</span>
				<span class='text'>Since the deciding bodies he had chosen were more concerned with the former, the prizes went to scientists more often than engineers, technicians or other inventors</span>
				<span class='text'>n 2001, Alfred Nobel's great-great-nephew, Peter Nobel (b</span>
				<span class='text'>1931), asked the Bank of Sweden to differentiate its award to economists given &quot;in Alfred Nobel's memory&quot; from the five other awards</span>
