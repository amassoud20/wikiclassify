				<span class='text'>12</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He was the only child of [[Apollo Korzeniowski]] and his wife Ewa Bobrowska</span>
				<span class='text'>His father was a writer, translator, political activist, and would-be revolutionary</span>
				<span class='text'>Conrad was christened ''Józef Teodor Konrad'' after his maternal grandfather Józef, his paternal grandfather Teodor, and the heroes (both named &quot;Konrad&quot;) of two poems by [[Adam Mickiewicz]], ''[[Dziady (poem)|Dziady]]'' and ''[[Konrad Wallenrod]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>He was subsequently known to his family as &quot;Konrad&quot;, rather than &quot;Józef&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Conrad's biographer [[Zdzisław Najder]] writes in a 2-page on-line article, [http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>l/aktualnosci/wiadomosci_2007/conradzn</span>
				<span class='text'>df] &quot;''Jak się nazywał Joseph Conrad?''&quot; (&quot;What Was Joseph Conrad's Name?&quot;):::&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> When he was baptized at the age of two days, on 5 December 1857 in [[Berdyczów]], no [[birth certificate]] was recorded because the baptism was only 'of water</span>
				<span class='text'>  And during his official, documented baptism (in [[Żytomierz]]) five years later, he himself was absent, as he was in [[Warsaw]], awaiting exile into [[Russia]] together with his parents</span>
				<span class='text'>:&quot;Thus there is much occasion for confusion</span>
				<span class='text'> This is attested by errors on tablets and monuments</span>
				<span class='text'> But examination of documents—not many, but quite a sufficient number, survive—permits an entirely certain answer to the title question</span>
				<span class='text'>:&quot;On 5 December 1857 the future writer was christened with three given names:  ''Józef'' (in honor of his maternal grandfather), ''Teodor'' (in honor of his paternal grandfather) and ''Konrad'' (doubtless in honor of the hero of part III of [[Adam Mickiewicz]]'s ''[[Dziady (poem)|Dziady]]'')</span>
				<span class='text'> These given names, in this order (they appear in no other order in any records), were given by Conrad himself in an extensive autobiographical letter to his friend [[Edward Garnett]] of 20 January 1900 (Polish text in ''Listy J</span>
				<span class='text'>Conrada'' [''Letters of J</span>
				<span class='text'>Conrad''], edited by Zdzisław Najder, Warsaw, 1968)</span>
				<span class='text'>:&quot;However, in the official birth certificate (a copy of which is found in the [[Jagiellonian University]] Library in [[Kraków]], manuscript no</span>
				<span class='text'>6391), only one given name appears:  ''Konrad''</span>
				<span class='text'> And that sole given name was used in their letters by his parents, Ewa, ''née'' Bobrowska, and [[Apollo Korzeniowski]], as well as by all members of the family</span>
				<span class='text'>:&quot;He himself signed himself with this single given name in letters to Poles</span>
				<span class='text'> And this single given name, and the surname 'Korzeniowski,' figured in his passport and other official documents</span>
				<span class='text'> For example, when 'Joseph Conrad' visited his native land after a long absence in 1914, just at the outbreak of [[World War I]], the papers issued to him by the military authorities of the Imperial-Royal [[Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]] called him 'Konrad Korzeniowski</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;Though the vast majority of the surrounding area's inhabitants were Ukrainians, and the great majority of Berdychiv's residents were Jewish, almost all the countryside was owned by the Polish ''[[szlachta]]'' (nobility), to which Conrad's family belonged as bearers of the [[Nałęcz coat-of-arms]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;John Stape, ''The Several Lives of Joseph Conrad'', p 2</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Polish literature, particularly patriotic literature, was held in high esteem by the area's Polish population</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;stewart&quot; /&gt;{{rp|1}}The Korzeniowski family played a significant role in Polish attempts to regain independence</span>
				<span class='text'>Conrad's paternal grandfather served under Prince [[Józef Poniatowski]] during [[French invasion of Russia|Napoleon's Russian campaign]] and formed his own cavalry squadron during the [[November Uprising|November 1830 Uprising]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Meyers, ''Joseph Conrad: a Biography'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>2-3</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Conrad's fiercely patriotic father belonged to the &quot;Red&quot; political faction, whose goal was to re-establish the pre-partition boundaries of Poland, but which also advocated land reform and the abolition of serfdom</span>
				<span class='text'>Conrad's subsequent refusal to follow in Apollo's footsteps, and his choice of exile over resistance, were a source of lifelong guilt for Conrad</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;&quot;Russia's defeat by Britain, France and Turkey [in the Crimean War] had once again raised hopes of Polish independence</span>
				<span class='text'> Apollo celebrated his son's christening with a characteristic patriotic–religious poem: &quot;To my son born in the 85th year of Muscovite oppression&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>It alluded to the [[First Partition of Poland|partition of 1772]], burdened the new-born [</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> with overwhelming obligations, and urged him to sacrifice himself as Apollo would for the good of his country:&lt;br /&gt; 'Bless you, my little son:&lt;br /&gt; Be a Pole! Though foes&lt;br /&gt; May spread before you&lt;br /&gt; A web of happiness&lt;br /&gt; Renounce it all: love your poverty</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>lt;br /&gt; Baby, son, tell yourself&lt;br /&gt; You are without land, without love,&lt;br /&gt; Without country, without people,&lt;br /&gt; While Poland - your Mother is in her grave&lt;br /&gt; For only your Mother is dead - and yet&lt;br /&gt; She is your faith, your palm of martyrdom</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Because of the father's attempts at farming and his political activism, the family moved repeatedly</span>
				<span class='text'>In May 1861 they moved to [[Warsaw]], where Apollo joined the resistance against the Russian Empire</span>
				<span class='text'>This led to his imprisonment in Pavilion X&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;&quot;X&quot; is the [[Roman numeral]] for &quot;Ten&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;najder&quot; /&gt;{{rp|19–25}}Apollo did his best to home-school Conrad</span>
				<span class='text'>The boy's early reading introduced him to the two elements that later dominated his life: in [[Victor Hugo]]'s ''[[Toilers of the Sea]]'' he encountered the sphere of activity to which he would devote his youth; [[Shakespeare]] brought him into the orbit of English literature</span>
				<span class='text'>Most of all, though, he read [[Polish Romanticism|Polish Romantic poetry]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Half a century later he explained that &quot;The Polishness in my works comes from [[Adam Mickiewicz|Mickiewicz]] and [[Juliusz Słowacki|Słowacki]]</span>
				<span class='text'>My father read [Mickiewicz's] ''[[Pan Tadeusz]]'' aloud to me and made me read it aloud</span>

				<span class='text'>Since he showed little inclination to study, it was essential that he learn a trade; his uncle saw him as a sailor-cum-businessman who would combine maritime skills with commercial activities</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;najder&quot; /&gt;{{rp|44–46}} In fact, in the autumn of 1871, thirteen-year-old Conrad announced his intention to become a sailor</span>
				<span class='text'>He later recalled that as a child he had read (apparently in French translation) [[Leopold McClintock]]'s book about his 1857–59 expeditions in the ''Fox'', in search of Sir [[John Franklin]]'s lost ships ''[[HMS Erebus (1826)|Erebus]]'' and ''[[HMS Terror (1813)|Terror]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;It was still an age of exploration, in which Poles participated:  [[Paweł Edmund Strzelecki]] mapped the Australian interior; the writer [[:pl:Sygurd Wiśniowski|Sygurd Wiśniowski]], having sailed twice around the world, described his experiences in Australia, Oceania and the United States; [[Jan Kubary]], a veteran of the [[January Uprising|1863 Uprising]], explored the Pacific islands</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;najder&quot; /&gt;{{rp|41–42}} A playmate of his adolescence recalled that Conrad spun fantastic yarns, always set at sea, presented so realistically that listeners thought the action was happening before their eyes</span>
				<span class='text'>n August 1873 Bobrowski sent fifteen-year-old Conrad to [[Lwów]] to a cousin who ran a small boarding house for boys orphaned by the [[January Uprising|1863 Uprising]]; group conversation there was in French</span>

				<span class='text'>In December 1867, with the Russian government's permission, his father Apollo had taken him to the Austrian part of the former Commonwealth, which enjoyed considerable internal freedom and a degree of self-government</span>
				<span class='text'>After the father's death, Conrad's uncle Bobrowski had attempted to secure Austrian citizenship for him – to no avail, probably because Conrad had not received permission from Russian authorities to remain abroad permanently and had not been released from being a Russian subject</span>
				<span class='text'>Conrad could not return to Ukraine, in the Russian Empire&amp;nbsp;– he would have been liable to many years' military service and, as the son of political exiles, to harassment</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;najder&quot; /&gt;{{rp|41}}In a letter of 9 August 1877, Conrad's uncle Bobrowski broached two important subjects:&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Conrad's own letters to his uncle [[Tadeusz Bobrowski]] were destroyed during World War I</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Zdzisław Najder]], ''Joseph Conrad:  A Life'', 2007</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; the desirability of Conrad's naturalisation abroad (tantamount to release from being a Russian subject) and Conrad's plans to join the British merchant marine</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;[D]o you speak English?</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>I never wished you to become naturalized in France, mainly because of the compulsory military service</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>I thought, however, of your getting naturalized in Switzerland</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot;  In his next letter, Bobrowski supported Conrad's idea of seeking citizenship of the United States or of &quot;one of the more important Southern Republics&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;najder&quot; /&gt;{{rp|57–58}}Eventually Conrad would make his home in England</span>
				<span class='text'>On 2 July 1886 he applied for British nationality, which was granted on 19 August 1886</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet, in spite of having become a subject of [[Queen Victoria]], Conrad had not ceased to be a subject of [[Tsar Alexander III]]</span>
				<span class='text'>To achieve the latter, he had to make many visits to the Russian Embassy in London and politely reiterate his request</span>
				<span class='text'>He would later recall the Embassy's home at [[Belgrave Square]] in his novel ''[[The Secret Agent]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;najder&quot; /&gt;{{rp|112}} Finally, on 2 April 1889, the Russian Ministry of Home Affairs released &quot;the son of a Polish man of letters, captain of the British merchant marine&quot; from the status of Russian subject</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;najder&quot; /&gt;{{rp|132}}===Merchant marine==={{main|Joseph Conrad's career at sea}}In 1874 Conrad left [[Poland]] to start a merchant-marine career</span>
				<span class='text'>After nearly four years in France and on French ships, he joined the British merchant marine and for the next fifteen years served under the [[Red Ensign]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He worked on a variety of ships as crew member (steward, apprentice, [[able-bodied seaman]]) and then as third, second and first mate, until eventually achieving captain's rank</span>
				<span class='text'>Of his 19-year merchant-marine career, only about half was spent actually at sea</span>
				<span class='text'>ost of Conrad's stories and novels, and many of their characters, were drawn from his seafaring career and persons whom he had met or heard about</span>
				<span class='text'>For his fictional characters he often borrowed the authentic names of actual persons</span>
				<span class='text'>The historic trader William Charles Olmeijer, whom Conrad encountered on four short visits to Berau in [[Borneo]], appears as &quot;Almayer&quot; (possibly a simple misspelling) in Conrad's first novel, ''[[Almayer's Folly]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Other authentic names include those of Captain McWhirr (in ''[[Typhoon (novel)|Typhoon]]''), Captain Beard and Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Mahon (''[[Youth (Conrad short story)|Youth]]''), Captain Lingard (''Almayer's Folly'' and elsewhere), and Captain Ellis (''[[The Shadow Line]]'')</span>
				<span class='text'>Conrad also preserves, in ''[[The Nigger of the 'Narcissus']]'', the authentic name of the ''Narcissus'', a ship in which he sailed in 1884</span>
				<span class='text'>onrad's three-year appointment with a Belgian trading company included service as captain of a [[steamboat|steamer]] on the [[Congo River]], an episode that would inspire his novella, ''[[Heart of Darkness]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:John galsworthy</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|[[John Galsworthy]], whom Conrad met on the ''[[Torrens (clipper ship)|Torrens]]'']]During a brief call in India in 1885–86, 28-year-old Conrad sent five letters to Joseph Spiridion,&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Joseph Spiridion's full name was &quot;Joseph Spiridion Kliszczewski&quot; but he used the abbreviated form, presumably from deference to British ignorance of Polish pronunciation</span>
				<span class='text'>Conrad seems to have picked up this idea from Spiridion: in his fourth letter, he signed himself &quot;J</span>
				<span class='text'>Conrad&quot;&amp;nbsp;— the first recorded use of his future pen name</span>
				<span class='text'> [[Zdzisław Najder]], ''Joseph Conrad:  A Life'', pp</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; a Pole eight years his senior whom he had befriended at [[Cardiff]] in June 1885 just before sailing for Singapore in the [[clipper ship]] ''Tilkhurst''</span>
				<span class='text'>These letters are Conrad's first preserved texts in English</span>
				<span class='text'>His English is generally correct but stiff to the point of artificiality; many fragments suggest that his thoughts ran along the lines of Polish [[syntax]] and [[phraseology]]</span>
				<span class='text'>More importantly, the letters show a marked change in views from those implied in his earlier correspondence of 1881–83</span>
				<span class='text'>He had departed from &quot;hope for the future&quot; and from the conceit of &quot;sailing [ever] toward Poland&quot;, and from his [[Panslavism|Panslavic]] ideas</span>
				<span class='text'>He was left with a painful sense of the hopelessness of the Polish question and an acceptance of England as a possible refuge</span>
				<span class='text'>While he often adjusted his statements to accord to some extent with the views of his addressees, the theme of hopelessness concerning the prospects for Polish independence often occurs authentically in his correspondence and works before 1914</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;najder&quot; /&gt;{{rp|104–5}}When Conrad left London on 25 October 1892 aboard the [[clipper ship]] ''[[Torrens (clipper ship)|Torrens]]'',  one of the passengers was William Henry Jacques, a [[tuberculosis|consumptive]] [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] graduate who died less than a year later (19 September 1893) and was, according to Conrad's ''[[A Personal Record]]'', the first reader of the still-unfinished manuscript of his ''[[Almayer's Folly]]''</span>
				<span class='text'> Jacques encouraged Conrad to continue writing the novel</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;najder&quot; /&gt;{{rp|181}}Conrad completed his last long-distance voyage as a seaman on 26 July 1893 when the ''Torrens'' docked at London and &quot;J</span>
				<span class='text'>Conrad Korzemowin&quot; (per the certificate of discharge) debarked</span>
				<span class='text'> When the ''Torrens'' had left Adelaide on 13 March 1893, the passengers had included two young Englishmen returning from [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]:  25-year-old lawyer and future novelist [[John Galsworthy]]; and Edward Lancelot Sanderson, who was going to help his father run a boys' preparatory school at [[Elstree School|Elstree]]</span>
				<span class='text'> They were probably the first Englishmen and non-sailors with whom Conrad struck up a friendship; he would remain in touch with both</span>
				<span class='text'> The protagonist of one of Galsworthy's first literary attempts, &quot;The Doldrums&quot; (1895–96), the first mate Armand, is obviously modeled on Conrad</span>
				<span class='text'> At Cape Town, where the ''Torrens'' remained from 17 to 19 May, Galsworthy left the ship to look at the local mines</span>
				<span class='text'> Sanderson continued his voyage and seems to have been the first to develop closer ties with Conrad</span>

				<span class='text'>His first novel, ''[[Almayer's Folly]]'', set on the east coast of [[Borneo]], was published in 1895</span>
				<span class='text'>Its appearance marked his first use of the pen name &quot;Joseph Conrad&quot;; &quot;Konrad&quot; was, of course, the third of his Polish [[given name]]s, but his use of it&amp;nbsp;– in the anglicised version, &quot;Conrad&quot;&amp;nbsp;– may also have been an [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to the Polish [[Romanticism in Poland|Romantic]] poet [[Adam Mickiewicz]]'s patriotic narrative poem, ''[[Konrad Wallenrod]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>quot; Garnett had shown the novel to his wife, [[Constance Garnett]], later a well-known translator of Russian literature</span>
				<span class='text'>She had thought Conrad's foreignness a positive merit</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;najder&quot; /&gt;{{rp|197}}While Conrad had only limited personal acquaintance with the peoples of [[Maritime Southeast Asia]], the region looms large in his early work</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Najder, Conrad, the exile and wanderer, was aware of a difficulty that he confessed more than once: the lack of a common cultural background with his [[:wikt:Anglophone|Anglophone]] readers meant he could not compete with English-language authors writing about the [[Anglosphere]]</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time, the choice of a non-English colonial setting freed him from an embarrassing division of loyalty: ''Almayer's Folly'', and later &quot;[[An Outpost of Progress]]&quot; (1897, set in a [[Congo Free State|Congo]] exploited by King [[Leopold II of Belgium]]) and ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' (1899, likewise set in the Congo), contain bitter reflections on [[colonialism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Malay states came theoretically under the suzerainty of the Dutch government; Conrad did not write about the area's British dependencies, which he never visited</span>
				<span class='text'>He &quot;was apparently intrigued by</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>struggles aimed at preserving national independence</span>
				<span class='text'>The prolific and destructive richness of tropical nature and the dreariness of human life within it accorded well with the pessimistic mood of his early works</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;''Almayer's Folly'', together with its successor, ''[[An Outcast of the Islands]]'' (1896), laid the foundation for Conrad's reputation as a romantic teller of exotic tales&amp;nbsp;– a misunderstanding of his purpose that was to frustrate him for the rest of his career</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;After ''[[The Mirror of the Sea]]'' was published on 4 October 1906 to good, sometimes enthusiastic reviews by critics and fellow writers, Conrad wrote his French translator:  &quot;The critics have been vigorously swinging the [[censer]] to me</span>
				<span class='text'></span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Financial success long eluded Conrad, who often asked magazine and book publishers for advances, and acquaintances (notably John Galsworthy) for loans</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In the first and longest, from the 1890s to World War I, Conrad writes most of his great novels, including ''[[The Nigger of the 'Narcissus']]'' (1897), ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' (1899), ''[[Lord Jim]]'' (1900), ''[[Nostromo]]'' (1904), ''[[The Secret Agent]]'' (1907) and ''[[Under Western Eyes]]'' (1911)</span>
				<span class='text'>The second phase, spanning the war and following the popular success of ''[[Chance (novel)|Chance]]'' (1913), is marked by the advent of Conrad's public [[persona]] as &quot;great writer&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>An old friend, Captain Gabriel Renouf of the French merchant marine, introduced him to the family of his brother-in-law</span>
				<span class='text'>Renouf's eldest sister was the wife of Louis Edward Schmidt, a senior official in the colony; with them lived two other sisters and two brothers</span>
				<span class='text'>Though the island had been taken over in 1810 by Britain, many of the inhabitants were descendants of the original French colonists, and Conrad's excellent French and perfect manners opened all local salons to him</span>
				<span class='text'>He became a frequent guest at the Schmidts', where he often met the Misses Renouf</span>
				<span class='text'>A couple of days before leaving Port Louis, Conrad asked one of the Renouf brothers for the hand of his 26-year-old sister Eugenie</span>
				<span class='text'>She was already, however, engaged to marry her pharmacist cousin</span>

				<span class='text'>]The 1914 vacation with his wife and sons in Poland, at the urging of [[Józef Retinger]], coincided with the outbreak of World War I</span>
				<span class='text'>On 28 July 1914, the day war broke out between [[Austro-Hungary]] and [[Serbia]], Conrad and the Retingers arrived in [[Kraków]] (then in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]), where Conrad visited childhood haunts</span>
				<span class='text'>As the city lay only a few miles from the Russian border, there was a risk of getting stranded in a battle zone</span>
				<span class='text'>With wife Jessie and younger son John ill, Conrad decided to take refuge in the mountain resort town of Zakopane</span>
				<span class='text'>They left Kraków on 2 August</span>
				<span class='text'>A few days after arrival in Zakopane, they moved to the Konstantynówka ''[[pension (lodging)|pension]]'' operated by Conrad's cousin Aniela Zagórska; it had been frequented by celebrities including the statesman [[Józef Piłsudski]] and Conrad's acquaintance, the young concert pianist [[Artur Rubinstein]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;najder&quot; /&gt;{{rp|458–63}}Zagórska introduced Conrad to Polish writers, intellectuals and artists who had also taken refuge in Zakopane, including novelist [[Stefan Żeromski]] and Tadeusz Nalepiński, a writer friend of anthropologist [[Bronisław Malinowski]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Conrad roused interest among the Poles as a famous writer and an exotic compatriot from abroad</span>
				<span class='text'>He charmed new acquaintances, especially women</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the double [[Nobel laureate]] [[Maria Skłodowska-Curie]]'s physician sister, [[Bronisława Dłuska]], scolded him for having used his great talent for purposes other than bettering the future of his native land&lt;ref name=&quot;najder&quot; /&gt;{{rp|463–64}}&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Fifteen years earlier, in 1899, Conrad had been greatly upset when the novelist [[Eliza Orzeszkowa]], responding to a misguided article by [[Wincenty Lutosławski]], had expressed views similar to Dłuska's</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;But thirty-two-year-old [[Aniela Zagórska]] (daughter of the ''pension'' keeper), Conrad's niece who would translate his works into Polish in 1923–39, idolised him, kept him company, and provided him with books</span>
				<span class='text'>He particularly delighted in the stories and novels of the ten-years-older, recently deceased [[Bolesław Prus]],&lt;ref name=&quot;najder&quot; /&gt;{{rp|463}}&lt;ref&gt;Zdzisław Najder, ''Conrad under Familial Eyes'', 1984, p</span>

				<span class='text'>Zdzisław Najder, ''Joseph Conrad: A Life'', 2007, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>463, 403, 454</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Conrad, who was noted by his Polish acquaintances to be fluent in his native tongue, participated in their impassioned political discussions</span>
				<span class='text'>He declared presciently, as Piłsudski had earlier in 1914 in Paris, that in the war, for Poland to regain independence, Russia must be beaten by the [[Central Powers]] (the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires), and the latter must in turn be beaten by [[French Third Republic|France]] and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;najder&quot; /&gt;{{rp|464}}After many travails and vicissitudes, at the beginning of November 1914 Conrad managed to bring his family back to England</span>
				<span class='text'>On his return, he was determined to work on swaying British opinion in favour of restoring Poland's sovereignty</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;najder&quot; /&gt;{{rp|464–68}}Jessie Conrad would later write in her memoirs: &quot;I understood my husband so much better after those months in Poland</span>
				<span class='text'>So many characteristics that had been strange and unfathomable to me before, took, as it were, their right proportions</span>
				<span class='text'>I understood that his temperament was that of his countrymen</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;najder&quot; /&gt;{{rp|466}}====Politics===={{blockquote|Conrad [writes Najder] was passionately concerned with politics</span>
				<span class='text'> [This] is confirmed by several of his works, starting with ''[[Almayer's Folly]]''</span>
				<span class='text'> [</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>  ''[[Nostromo]]'' revealed his concern with these matters more fully; it was, of course, a concern quite natural for someone from a country [Poland] where politics was a matter not only of everyday existence but also of life and death</span>
				<span class='text'> Moreover, Conrad himself came from a social class that claimed exclusive responsibility for state affairs, and from a very politically active family</span>
				<span class='text'> [[Norman Douglas]] sums it up:  &quot;Conrad was first and foremost a Pole and like many Poles a politician and moralist ''malgré lui'' [French:  &quot;in spite of himself&quot;]</span>
				<span class='text'> These are his fundamentals</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;  [What made] Conrad see political problems in terms of a continuous struggle between law and violence, anarchy and order, freedom and autocracy, material interests and the noble idealism of individuals [</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> was Conrad's historical awareness</span>
				<span class='text'> His Polish experience endowed him with the perception, exceptional in the Western European literature of his time, of how winding and constantly changing were the front lines in these struggles</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[Zdzisław Najder]], ''Joseph Conrad:  A Life'', 2007, p</span>
				<span class='text'>352</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;}}The most extensive and ambitious political statement that Conrad ever made was his 1905 essay, &quot;Autocracy and War&quot;, whose starting point was the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (he finished the article a month before the [[Battle of Tsushima Strait]])</span>
				<span class='text'>The essay begins with a statement about Russia's incurable weakness and ends with warnings against [[Prussia]], the dangerous aggressor in a future European war</span>
				<span class='text'>For Russia he predicted a violent outburst in the near future, but Russia's lack of democratic traditions and the backwardness of her masses made it impossible for the revolution to have a salutary effect</span>
				<span class='text'>Conrad regarded the formation of a representative government in Russia as unfeasible and foresaw a transition from autocracy to dictatorship</span>
				<span class='text'>He saw western Europe as torn by antagonisms engendered by economic rivalry and commercial selfishness</span>
				<span class='text'>In vain might a Russian revolution seek advice or help from a materialistic and egoistic western Europe that armed itself in preparation for wars far more brutal than those of the past</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;najder&quot; /&gt;{{rp|351–54}}Conrad's &quot;Autocracy and War&quot;, Najder points out, showed a historical awareness &quot;exceptional in the Western European literature of his time&quot; – an awareness that Conrad had drawn from his membership in a very politically active family of a country that had for over a century been daily reminded of the consequences of neglecting the broad enlightened interests of the national [[polity]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;najder&quot; /&gt;{{rp|352}}Conrad's distrust of democracy sprang from his doubts whether the propagation of democracy as an aim in itself could solve any problems</span>
				<span class='text'>He thought that, in view of the weakness of [[human nature]] and of the &quot;criminal&quot; character of society, democracy offered boundless opportunities for [[demagogue]]s and [[charlatan]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;najder&quot; /&gt;{{rp|290}}He accused [[social democrats]] of his time of acting to weaken &quot;the national sentiment, the preservation of which [was his] concern&quot; – of attempting to dissolve national identities in an impersonal melting-pot</span>
				<span class='text'> &quot;I look at the future from the depth of a very black past and I find that nothing is left for me except fidelity to a cause lost, to an idea without future</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;  It was Conrad's hopeless fidelity to the memory of [[Poland]] that prevented him from believing in the idea of &quot;international fraternity,&quot; which he considered, under the circumstances, just a verbal exercise</span>
				<span class='text'>He resented some socialists' talk of freedom and world brotherhood while keeping silent about his own partitioned and oppressed Poland</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;najder&quot; /&gt;{{rp|290}}Before that, in the early 1880s, letters to Conrad from his uncle [[Tadeusz Bobrowski|Tadeusz]]&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Conrad's own letters to his uncle in Ukraine, writes Najder, were destroyed during World War I</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; show Conrad apparently having hoped for an improvement in Poland's situation not through a liberation movement but by establishing an alliance with neighbouring Slavic nations</span>
				<span class='text'>This had been accompanied by a faith in the [[Panslavism|Panslavic]] ideology – &quot;surprising,&quot; Najder writes, &quot;in a man who was later to emphasize his hostility towards Russia, a conviction that</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Poland's [superior] civilization and</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>historic</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>traditions would [let] her play a leading role</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>in the Panslavic community, [and his] doubts about Poland's chances of becoming a fully sovereign nation-state</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;najder&quot; /&gt;{{rp|88–89}}Conrad's alienation from ''partisan'' politics went together with an abiding sense of the thinking man's burden imposed by his personality, as described in an 1894 letter of Conrad's to a relative-by-marriage and fellow author, Marguerite Poradowska (''née'' Gachet, and cousin of [[Vincent van Gogh]]'s physician, [[Paul Gachet]]) of Brussels:{{blockquote|We must drag the chain and ball of our personality to the end</span>
				<span class='text'>This is the price one pays for the infernal and divine privilege of thought; so in this life it is only the chosen who are convicts – a glorious band which understands and groans but which treads the earth amidst a multitude of phantoms with maniacal gestures and idiotic grimaces</span>
				<span class='text'>Which would you rather be:  idiot or convict?&lt;ref name=&quot;najder&quot; /&gt;{{rp|195}} }}In a 23 October 1922 letter to mathematician-philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]], in response to the latter's book, ''The Problem of China'', which advocated socialist reforms and an [[oligarchy]] of sages who would reshape Chinese society, Conrad explained his own distrust of political panaceas:{{blockquote|I have never [found] in any man's book or</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>talk anything</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>to stand up</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>against my deep-seated sense of fatality governing this man-inhabited world</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> The only remedy for Chinamen and for the rest of us is [a] change of hearts, but looking at the history of the last 2000 years there is not much reason to expect [it], even if man has taken to flying – a great &quot;uplift&quot; no doubt but no great change</span>

				<span class='text'>He used his sailing experiences as a backdrop for many of his works, but he also produced works of similar [[world view]], without the nautical motifs</span>
				<span class='text'>The failure of many critics to appreciate this caused him much frustration</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;najder&quot; /&gt;{{rp|377, 562}}He wrote oftener about life at sea and in exotic parts than about life on British land because—unlike, for example, his friend [[John Galsworthy]], author of ''[[The Forsyte Saga]]''—he knew little about everyday domestic relations in Britain</span>
				<span class='text'> When Conrad's ''The Mirror of the Sea'' was published in 1906 to critical acclaim, he wrote his French translator:  &quot;The critics have been vigorously swinging the censer to me</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;najder&quot; /&gt;He also borrowed from other, Polish- and French-language authors, to an extent sometimes skirting [[plagiarism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>When the Polish translation of his 1915 novel ''[[Victory (novel)|Victory]]'' appeared in 1931, readers noted striking similarities to [[Stefan Żeromski]]'s kitschy novel, ''The History of a Sin'' (''Dzieje grzechu'', 1908), including their endings</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Comparative literature|Comparative-literature]] scholar Yves Hervouet has demonstrated in the text of ''Victory'' a whole mosaic of influences, borrowings, similarities and allusions</span>
				<span class='text'>He further lists hundreds of concrete borrowings from other, mostly French authors in nearly all of Conrad's works, from ''Almayer's Folly'' (1895) to his unfinished ''Suspense''</span>
				<span class='text'>Conrad seems to have used eminent writers' texts as raw material of the same kind as the content of his own memory</span>
				<span class='text'>Materials borrowed from other authors often functioned as [[allusion]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, he had a phenomenal memory for texts and remembered details, &quot;but [writes Najder] it was not a memory strictly categorized according to sources, marshalled into homogeneous entities; it was, rather, an enormous receptacle of images and pieces from which he would draw</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;najder&quot; /&gt;{{rp|454–7}}{{blockquote|But [writes Najder] he can never be accused of outright plagiarism</span>
				<span class='text'>Even when lifting sentences and scenes, Conrad changed their character, inserted them within novel structures</span>
				<span class='text'>He did not imitate, but (as Hervouet says) &quot;continued&quot; his masters</span>
				<span class='text'>He was right in saying:  &quot;I don't resemble anybody</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;  [[Ian Watt]] put it succinctly:  &quot;In a sense, Conrad is the least derivative of writers; he wrote very little that could possibly be mistaken for the work of anyone else</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;  (Preface to ''[[Major Barbara]]'', 1905</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt;}}Conrad, like other artists, faced constraints arising from the need to propitiate his audience and confirm its own favourable self-regard</span>
				<span class='text'>This may account for his describing the admirable crew of the ''Judea'' in his 1898 story &quot;[[Youth (Conrad short story)|Youth]]&quot; as &quot;[[Liverpool]] hard cases&quot;, whereas the crew of the ''Judea'''s actual 1882 prototype, the ''Palestine'', had included not a single Liverpudlian, and half the crew had been non-Britons;&lt;ref name=&quot;najder&quot; /&gt;{{rp|94}} and for Conrad's turning the real-life 1880 criminally negligent British Captain J</span>
				<span class='text'>L</span>
				<span class='text'>Clark, of the {{SS|Jeddah}}, in his 1900 novel ''[[Lord Jim]]'', into the captain of the fictitious ''Patna''&amp;nbsp;– &quot;a sort of renegade [[New South Wales]] German&quot; so monstrous in physical appearance as to suggest &quot;a trained baby elephant</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;stewart&quot; /&gt;{{rp|98–103}} Similarly, in his letters Conrad&amp;nbsp;– during most of his literary career, struggling for sheer financial survival&amp;nbsp;– often adjusted his views to the predilections of his correspondents</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;najder&quot; /&gt;{{rp|105}} And when he wished to criticise the conduct of European [[imperialism]] in what would later be termed the &quot;[[Third World]]&quot;, he turned his gaze upon the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] and [[Congo Free State|Belgian colonies]], not upon the [[British Empire]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;najder&quot; /&gt;{{rp|119}}The singularity of the universe depicted in Conrad's novels, especially compared to those of near-contemporaries like his friend and frequent benefactor [[John Galsworthy]], is such as to open him to criticism similar to that later applied to [[Graham Greene]]</span>

				<span class='text'>In the view of [[Evelyn Waugh]] and [[Kingsley Amis]], it was not until the first volumes of [[Anthony Powell]]'s sequence, ''[[A Dance to the Music of Time]]'', were published in the 1950s, that an English novelist achieved the same command of atmosphere and precision of language with consistency, a view supported by later critics like [[A</span>

				<span class='text'>Leo Gurko, too, remarks, as &quot;one of Conrad's special qualities, his abnormal awareness of place, an awareness magnified to almost a new dimension in art, an ecological dimension defining the relationship between earth and man</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> goes on sounding in waves, like the note of a tenor bell, after it stops</span>
				<span class='text'>It's not built in the rhythm of ordinary prose, but on something existing only in his head, and as he can never say what it is he wants to say, all his things end in a kind of hunger, a suggestion of something he can't say or do or think</span>
				<span class='text'>So his books always look bigger than they are</span>

				<span class='text'>Yet, as his ideas were borne out by ensuing 20th-century events, in due course he came to be admired for beliefs that seemed to accord more closely with subsequent times than with his own</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|175px|Conrad's friend [[Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham|Cunninghame Graham]]]]In a letter of late December 1897 to [[Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham|Cunninghame Graham]], Conrad metaphorically described the [[universe]] as a huge machine:{{blockquote|It evolved itself (I am severely scientific) out of a chaos of scraps of iron and behold! – it knits</span>
				<span class='text'>I am horrified at the horrible work and stand appalled</span>
				<span class='text'>I feel it ought to embroider – but it goes on knitting</span>
				<span class='text'>You come and say: &quot;this is all right; it's only a question of the right kind of oil</span>
				<span class='text'>Let us use this&amp;nbsp;– for instance&amp;nbsp;– celestial oil and the machine shall embroider a most beautiful design in purple and gold</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;  Will it?  Alas no</span>
				<span class='text'>You cannot by any special lubrication make embroidery with a knitting machine</span>
				<span class='text'>And the most withering thought is that the infamous thing has made itself; made itself without thought, without conscience, without foresight, without eyes, without heart</span>
				<span class='text'>It is a tragic accident&amp;nbsp;–and it has happened</span>
				<span class='text'>You can't interfere with it</span>
				<span class='text'>The last drop of bitterness is in the suspicion that you can't even smash it</span>
				<span class='text'>In virtue of that truth one and immortal which lurks in the force that made it spring into existence it is what it is&amp;nbsp; – and it is indestructible!}}{{blockquote|It knits us in and it knits us out</span>
				<span class='text'>It has knitted time space, pain, death, corruption, despair and all the illusions&amp;nbsp; – and nothing matters</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;najder&quot; /&gt;{{rp|253}} }}Conrad is the novelist of man in extreme situations</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Those who read me,&quot; he wrote in the preface to ''[[A Personal Record]]'', &quot;know my conviction that the world, the temporal world, rests on a few very simple ideas; so simple that they must be as old as the hills</span>
				<span class='text'>It rests, notably, among others, on the idea of Fidelity</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{blockquote|For Conrad fidelity is the barrier man erects against nothingness, against corruption, against the evil that is all about him, insidious, waiting to engulf him, and that in some sense is within him unacknowledged</span>
				<span class='text'>But what happens when fidelity is submerged, the barrier broken down, and the evil without is acknowledged by the evil within? At his greatest, that is Conrad's theme</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;encyclo_bio&quot; /&gt;}}What is the essence of Conrad's art?  It surely is not the plot, which he&amp;nbsp;– like Shakespeare&amp;nbsp;– often borrows from public sources and which could be duplicated by lesser authors; the plot serves merely as the vehicle for what the author has to say</span>
				<span class='text'>A focus on plot leads to the absurdity of [[Charles Lamb|Charles]] and [[Mary Lamb]]'s 1807 ''[[Tales from Shakespeare]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Rather, Conrad's essence is to be sought in his depiction of the world open to our senses, and in the [[world view]] that he has evolved in the course of experiencing that outer, and his own inner, world</span>
				<span class='text'>An evocative part of that view is expressed in an August 1901 letter that Conrad wrote to the editor of ''The New York Times Saturday Book Review'':{{blockquote|Egoism, which is the moving force of the world, and altruism, which is its morality, these two contradictory instincts, of which one is so plain and the other so mysterious, cannot serve us unless in the incomprehensible alliance of their irreconcilable antagonism</span>

				<span class='text'>447–48</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; }}===Language===Conrad spoke both his native Polish language and the French language fluently from childhood and only acquired English in his twenties</span>
				<span class='text'>Why then did he choose to write his books in, effectively, his third language?  He states in his preface to ''[[A Personal Record]]'' that writing in English was for him &quot;natural&quot;, and that the idea of his having made a deliberate choice between English and French, as some had suggested, was in error</span>
				<span class='text'>He explained that, though he was familiar with French from childhood, &quot;I would have been afraid to attempt expression in a language so perfectly 'crystallized'</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|iv-x}} In a 1915 conversation with American sculptor [[Jo Davidson]], as he posed for his bust, in response to Davidson's question Conrad said: &quot;Ah… to write French you have to know it</span>
				<span class='text'>English is so plastic—if you haven't got a word you need you can make it, but to write French you have to be an artist like Anatole France</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; These statements, as so often happens in Conrad's &quot;autobiographical&quot; writings, are subtly disingenuous</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;najder&quot; /&gt; In 1897 Conrad was paid a visit by a fellow Pole, [[Wincenty Lutosławski]], who was intent on imploring Conrad to write in Polish and &quot;to win Conrad for Polish literature&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Lutosławski recalls that during their conversation Conrad explained why he did not write in Polish: &quot;I value too much our beautiful Polish literature to introduce into it my worthless twaddle</span>
				<span class='text'>But for Englishmen my capacities are just sufficient: they enable me to earn my living&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Perhaps revealingly, Conrad later wrote to Lutosławski to keep his visit a secret</span>

				<span class='text'>91–93</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;More to the point is Conrad's remark in ''A Personal Record'' that English was &quot;the speech of my secret choice, of my future, of long friendships, of the deepest affections, of hours of toil and hours of ease, and of solitary hours, too, of books read, of thoughts pursued, of remembered emotions—of my very dreams!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;conrad_personal&quot; /&gt;{{rp|252}} In 1878 Conrad's four-year experience in the French merchant marine had been cut short when the French discovered that he did not have a permit from the Imperial Russian consul to sail with the French</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;At this juncture, Conrad attempted to join the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Navy</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Zdzisław Najder|Najder]], ''Joseph Conrad: A Life'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>65</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This, and some typically disastrous Conradian investments, had left him destitute and had precipitated a suicide attempt</span>
				<span class='text'>With the concurrence of his uncle Bobrowski, who had been summoned to Marseilles, Conrad decided to seek employment with the British merchant marine, which did not require Russia's permission</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;najder&quot; /&gt;{{rp|64–66}} Thus began Conrad's sixteen years' seafarer's acquaintance with the British and with the English language</span>
				<span class='text'>ad Conrad remained in the [[wikt:Francophone|Francophone]] sphere or had he returned to Poland, the son of the Polish poet, playwright and translator [[Apollo Korzeniowski]]&amp;nbsp;– from childhood exposed to Polish and foreign literature, and ambitious to himself become a writer&lt;ref name=&quot;najder&quot; /&gt;{{rp|43–44}} –might have ended writing in French or Polish instead of English</span>
				<span class='text'>Certainly his mentor-uncle [[Tadeusz Bobrowski]] thought Conrad might write in Polish; in an 1881 letter he advised his 23-year-old nephew:{{blockquote|As, thank God, you do not forget your Polish</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>and your writing is not bad, I repeat what I have</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>written and said before – you would do well to write</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>for ''Wędrowiec'' [The Wanderer] in Warsaw</span>
				<span class='text'>We have few travelers, and even fewer genuine correspondents: the words of an eyewitness would be of great interest and in time would bring you</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>money</span>
				<span class='text'>It would be an exercise in your native tongue—that thread which binds you to your country and countrymen—and finally a tribute to the memory of your father who always wanted to and did serve his country by his pen</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;najder&quot; /&gt;{{rp|86}} }}Inescapably, Conrad's third language, English, remained under the influence of his first two languages&amp;nbsp;– Polish and French</span>
				<span class='text'>This makes his English seem unusual</span>
				<span class='text'>Najder observes:{{blockquote|[H]e was a man of three cultures:  Polish, French, and English</span>
				<span class='text'> Brought up in a Polish family and cultural environment</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>he learned French as a child, and at the age of less than seventeen went to France, to serve</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>four years in the French merchant marine</span>
				<span class='text'> At school he must have learned German, but French remained the language he spoke with greatest fluency (and no foreign accent) until the end of his life</span>
				<span class='text'> He was well versed in French history and literature, and French novelists were his artistic models</span>
				<span class='text'> But he wrote all his books in English—the tongue he started to learn at the age of twenty</span>
				<span class='text'> He was thus an English writer who grew up in other linguistic and cultural environments</span>
				<span class='text'> His work can be seen as located in the borderland of ''auto-translation'' [emphasis added by Wikipedia]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;najder&quot; /&gt;{{rp|IX}} }}Inevitably for a trilingual Polish–French–English-speaker, Conrad's writings occasionally show examples of &quot;[[Franglais]]&quot; and &quot;[[Poglish]]&quot;&amp;nbsp;– of the inadvertent use of French or Polish vocabulary, grammar or syntax in his English compositions</span>
				<span class='text'>In one instance, [[Zdzisław Najder|Najder]] uses &quot;several slips in vocabulary, typical for Conrad ([[Gallicism]]s) and grammar (usually Polonisms)&quot; as part of [[internal evidence]] against Conrad's sometime literary collaborator [[Ford Madox Ford]]'s claim to have written a certain instalment of Conrad's novel ''[[Nostromo]]'', for serialised publication in ''T</span>
				<span class='text'>P</span>
				<span class='text'>s Weekly'', on behalf of an ill Conrad</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;najder&quot; /&gt;{{rp|341–42}}The impracticality of working with a language which has long ceased to be one's principal language of daily use is illustrated by Conrad's 1921 attempt at translating into English the Polish columnist and comedy-writer [[Bruno Winawer]]'s short play, ''The Book of Job''</span>
				<span class='text'>Najder writes:{{blockquote|[T]he [play's] language is easy, colloquial, slightly individualized</span>
				<span class='text'>Particularly Herup and a snobbish Jew, &quot;Bolo&quot; Bendziner, have their characteristic ways of speaking</span>
				<span class='text'>Conrad, who had had little contact with everyday spoken Polish, simplified the dialogue, left out Herup's scientific expressions, and missed many amusing nuances</span>
				<span class='text'>The action in the original is quite clearly set in contemporary Warsaw, somewhere between elegant society and the demimonde; this specific cultural setting is lost in the translation</span>
				<span class='text'>Conrad left out many accents of topical satire in the presentation of the dramatis personae and ignored not only the ungrammatical speech (which might have escaped him) of some characters but even the Jewishness of two of them, Bolo and Mosan</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;najder&quot; /&gt;{{rp|538–39}} }}As a practical matter, by the time Conrad set about writing fiction, he had little choice but to write in English</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Still, Conrad retained a fluency in Polish and French that was more than adequate for ordinary purposes</span>
				<span class='text'>When at a loss for an English expression, he would use a French one or describe a Polish one, and he often spoke and corresponded with Anglophones and others in French; while speaking and corresponding with Poles in Polish</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Zdzisław Najder|Najder]], ''Joseph Conrad: A Life'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>441 ''et passim</span>
				<span class='text'>'&lt;/ref&gt; Poles who accused Conrad of cultural [[apostasy]] because he wrote in English instead of Polish,&lt;ref name=&quot;najder&quot; /&gt;{{rp|292–95, 463–64}} missed the point&amp;nbsp;– as do [[Anglosphere|Anglophone]]s who see, in Conrad's default choice of English as his artistic medium, a testimonial to some sort of innate superiority of the English language</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Some shortcomings of English (which had earlier been noted by writers and scholars including [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Noah Webster]], [[Melville Dewey]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]]) have been described by linguist [[Mario Pei]]:  &quot;English spelling is by far the worst, the most inconsistent, of all spellings on earth</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> Other defects of English are its uncertain [[syllabification]] and unpredictable stress</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;  [[Mario Pei]], ''The Story of Language'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>455</span>
				<span class='text'>The atrocious spelling of English, stems from the language's promiscuous construction from elements of French, Latin and Germanic languages</span>
				<span class='text'>On the other hand, Conrad's knowledge of French, Latin, German – the root stocks of the English language – and of Polish (since the Middle Ages, much-[[calque]]d on Latin) would have been a great assist to him in acquiring the English language (except, notoriously, for its pronunciation)</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Zdzisław Najder|Najder]], ''Joseph Conrad: A Life'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>46–47</span>
				<span class='text'> Conrad's knowledge of Polish, an essentially [[phonetic]] language, would have helped him master French and English spelling, much as [[Mario Pei]]'s knowledge of Italian gave him an &quot;advantage to be able to memorize the written form of an English word in the phonetic pronunciation that such a written form would have had in my native Italian</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;  Mario Pei, ''The Story of Language'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>422</span>
				<span class='text'>This ability would, of course, by itself have done nothing to ensure Conrad's command of English pronunciation, which remained always strange to Anglophone ears; it is difficult to master the pronunciation of an unfamiliar language after [[puberty]], and Conrad was 20 before he first stepped onto English soil</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; According to Conrad's close friend and literary assistant [[Richard Curle]], the fact of Conrad writing in English was &quot;obviously misleading&quot; because Conrad &quot;is no more completely English in his art than he is in his nationality&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Impressions==A striking portrait of Conrad, aged about 46, was drawn by the historian and poet [[Henry Newbolt]], who met him about 1903:{{blockquote|One thing struck me at once—the extraordinary difference between his expression in profile and when looked at full face</span>
				<span class='text'>[W]hile the profile was aquiline and commanding, in the front view the broad brow, wide-apart eyes and full lips produced the effect of an intellectual calm and even at times of a dreaming philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>Then [a]s we sat in our little half-circle round the fire, and talked on anything and everything, I saw a third Conrad emerge—an artistic self, sensitive and restless to the last degree</span>
				<span class='text'>The more he talked the more quickly he consumed his cigarettes</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>And presently, when I asked him why he was leaving London after</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>only two days, he replied that</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>the crowd in the streets</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>terrified him</span>
				<span class='text'> &quot;Terrified?  By that dull stream of obliterated faces?&quot;  He leaned forward with both hands raised and clenched</span>
				<span class='text'> &quot;Yes, terrified:  I see their personalities all leaping out at me like ''tigers''!&quot;  He acted the tiger well enough almost to terrify his hearers:  but the moment after he was talking again wisely and soberly as if he were an average Englishman with not an irritable nerve in his body</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;najder&quot; /&gt;{{rp|331}} }}On 12 October 1912, American music critic [[James Huneker]] visited Conrad and later recalled being received by &quot;a man of the world, neither sailor nor novelist, just a simple-mannered gentleman, whose welcome was sincere, whose glance was veiled, at times far-away, whose ways were French, Polish, anything but 'literary,' bluff or English</span>

				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|150px|[[Lady Ottoline Morrell]]]]After respective separate visits to Conrad in August and September 1913, two British aristocrats, the socialite [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]] and the mathematician and philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]]&amp;nbsp;– who were lovers at the time&amp;nbsp;– recorded their impressions of the novelist</span>
				<span class='text'>In her diary, Morrell wrote:{{blockquote|I found Conrad himself standing at the door of the house ready to receive me</span>
				<span class='text'>How different from the [disparaging] picture [[Henry James]] had evoked [in conversation with Morrell], for Conrad's appearance was really that of a Polish nobleman</span>
				<span class='text'>His manner was perfect, almost too elaborate; so nervous and sympathetic that every fibre of him seemed electric</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>He talked English with a strong accent, as if he tasted his words in his mouth before pronouncing them; but he talked extremely well, though he had always the talk and manner of a foreigner</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>He was dressed very carefully in a blue double-breasted jacket</span>
				<span class='text'>He talked</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>apparently with great freedom about his life – more ease and freedom indeed than an Englishman would have allowed himself</span>
				<span class='text'>He spoke of the horrors of the [[Congo (area)|Congo]], from the moral and physical shock of which he said he had never recovered</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>[His wife Jessie] seemed a nice and good-looking fat creature, an excellent cook, as Henry James [had] said, and was indeed a good and reposeful mattress for this hypersensitive, nerve-wracked man, who did not ask from his wife high intelligence, only an assuagement of life's vibrations</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> He made me feel so natural and very much myself, that I was almost afraid of losing the thrill and wonder of being there, although I was vibrating with intense excitement inside; and even now, as I write this, I feel almost the same excitement, the same thrill of having been in the presence of one of the most remarkable men I have known</span>
				<span class='text'>His eyes under their pent-house lids revealed the suffering and the intensity of his experiences; when he spoke of his work, there came over them a sort of misty, sensuous, dreamy look, but they seemed to hold deep down the ghosts of old adventures and experiences – once or twice there was something in them one almost suspected of being wicked</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> But then I believe whatever strange wickedness would tempt this super-subtle Pole, he would be held in restraint by an equally delicate sense of honour</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> In his talk he led me along many paths of his life, but I felt that he did not wish to explore the jungle of emotions that lay dense on either side, and that his apparent frankness had a great reserve</span>
				<span class='text'>This may perhaps be characteristic of Poles as it is of the Irish</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;najder&quot; /&gt;{{rp|447}} }}A month later, [[Bertrand Russell]] visited Conrad at Capel House, and the same day on the train wrote down his impressions:[[File:Honourable Bertrand Russell</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|120px|[[Bertrand Russell]]]]{{blockquote|It was ''wonderful'' – I ''loved'' him &amp; I think he liked me</span>

				<span class='text'> I got him on to Henry James</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Then we went for a little walk, &amp; somehow grew very intimate</span>
				<span class='text'>I plucked up courage to tell him what I find in his work – the boring down into things to get to the very bottom below the apparent facts</span>
				<span class='text'>He seemed to feel I had understood him; then I stopped &amp; we just looked into each other's eyes for some time, &amp; then he said he had grown to wish he could live on the surface and write differently, that he had grown frightened</span>
				<span class='text'>His eyes at the moment expressed the inward pain &amp; terror that one feels him always fighting</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> Then he talked a lot about Poland, &amp; showed me an album of family photographs of the [18]60's – spoke about how dream-like all that seems, &amp; how he sometimes feels he ought not to have had any children, because they have no roots or traditions or relations</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;najder&quot; /&gt;{{rp|448}} }}Russell's insights, so resonant with Morrell's, reveal the profundity of Conrad's existential loneliness</span>
				<span class='text'>Russell's ''Autobiography'', published over half a century later in 1968, vividly confirms his original experience:{{blockquote|My first impression was one of surprise</span>
				<span class='text'>He spoke English with a very strong foreign accent, and nothing in his demeanour in any way suggested the sea</span>
				<span class='text'>He was an aristocratic Polish gentleman to his fingertips</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> At our very first meeting, we talked with continually increasing intimacy</span>
				<span class='text'>We seemed to sink through layer after layer of what was superficial, till gradually both reached the central fire</span>
				<span class='text'>It was an experience unlike any other</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>I have known</span>
				<span class='text'>We looked into each other's eyes, half appalled and half intoxicated to find ourselves together in such a region</span>
				<span class='text'>The emotion was as intense as passionate love, and at the same time all-embracing</span>
				<span class='text'>I came away bewildered, and hardly able to find my way among ordinary affairs</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;najder&quot; /&gt;{{rp|448–49}} }}The two men's subsequent friendship and correspondence lasted, with long intervals, to the end of Conrad's life</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;najder&quot; /&gt;{{rp|449}}  Conrad in his correspondence often used the [[Latin]] expression meaning &quot;to the very end&quot;, which he seems to have adopted from his faithful guardian, mentor and benefactor, his maternal uncle [[Tadeusz Bobrowski]]</span>
