				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ce&quot;&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Pope St</span>
				<span class='text'>Leo I (the Great)}}&lt;/ref&gt;He was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[aristocracy|aristocrat]], and was the first pope to have been called &quot;the Great&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He is perhaps best known for having met [[Attila the Hun]] in 452 and persuading him to turn back from his invasion of Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>He is also a [[Doctor of the Church]], most remembered theologically for issuing the [[Tome of Leo]], a document which was foundational to the debates of the [[Ecumenical Council]] of [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedon]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Council of Chalcedon, the fourth ecumenical council, dealt primarily with [[Christology]], and elucidated the [[orthodoxy|orthodox]] definition of [[Christ]]'s being as the [[hypostatic union]] of two natures—divine and human—united in one person, &quot;with neither confusion nor division&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>It was followed by a major [[schism (religion)|schism]] associated with [[Monophysitism]], [[Miaphysitism]] and [[Dyophysitism]]</span>

				<span class='text'>By 431, as a [[deacon]], he occupied a sufficiently important position for [[Cyril of Alexandria]] to apply to him in order that Rome's influence should be thrown against the claims of [[Juvenal of Jerusalem]] to patriarchal jurisdiction over [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]—unless this letter is addressed rather to [[Pope Celestine I]]</span>
				<span class='text'>About the same time [[John Cassian]] dedicated to him the treatise against [[Nestorius]] written at his request</span>
				<span class='text'>But nothing shows more plainly the confidence felt in him than his being chosen by the emperor to settle the dispute between [[Flavius Aëtius|Aëtius]] and [[Caecina Decius Aginatius Albinus (consul 444)|Caecina Decius Aginatius Albinus]], the two highest officials in [[Gaul]]</span>
				<span class='text'>uring his absence on this mission, [[Pope Sixtus III]] died (11 August 440), and Leo was unanimously elected by the people to succeed him</span>
				<span class='text'>On 29 September he entered upon a pontificate which was to be epoch-making for the centralization of the government of the Roman Church</span>
				<span class='text'>=Leo's Theology=====Teaching on Christ===Leo's writings (both the sermons and the letters) are mostly concerned with theological questions concerning the person of Jesus Christ (Christology) and his role as mediator and savior (Soteriology)</span>
				<span class='text'>This is partially connected to the Council of Chalcedon in which Roman legates participated in Leo's name</span>
				<span class='text'>Subsequently, through numerous letters addressed to bishops and members of the imperial family, Leo incessantly worked for the propagation and universal reception of the faith in Christ as defined by Chalcedon, also in the eastern part of the Roman empire</span>
				<span class='text'>Leo defends the true divinity and the true humanity of the one Christ against heretical one-sidedness</span>
				<span class='text'>He takes up this topic also in many of his sermons, and over the years he further develops his own original concepts</span>
				<span class='text'>A central idea around which Leo deepens and explains his theology is Christ's presence in the Church, more specifically in the teaching and preaching of the faith (Scripture, Tradition and their interpretation), in the liturgy (sacraments and celebrations), in the life of the individual believer and of the organized Church, especially in a council</span>
				<span class='text'>==The Apostle Peter and his heir===Leo contributed to the development of the doctrine on papal primacy, based on his personal devotion to St Peter and on the veneration for the Apostle and his tomb in Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>Besides recourse to biblical language, Leo also describes his own special relationship with St Peter in terms derived from Roman law</span>
				<span class='text'>He calls himself the (unworthy) heir and deputy (''vicarius'') of Peter, having received his apostolic authority and being obliged to follow his example</span>
				<span class='text'>On the one hand, Peter stands before him with a claim on how Leo is to exercise his office; on the other hand, Leo, as the Roman bishop, represents the Apostle, whose authority he holds</span>
				<span class='text'>Christ, however, always comes out as the source of all grace and authority, and Leo is responsible to him for how he fulfills his duties (cf</span>
				<span class='text'>sermon 1)</span>
				<span class='text'>Peter is indeed the example for Leo's relationship to Christ</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, the office of the Roman bishop, with its universal significance, is grounded on the special relationship between Christ and St Peter, a relationship that per se cannot be repeated; therefore, Leo depends on St Peter's mediation, his assistance and his example in order to be able to adequately fulfill his role and exercise his authority as the Bishop of Rome, both in the city and beyond</span>
				<span class='text'>=Papal authority=={{Infobox popestyles|image      = |dipstyle   = [[His Holiness]]|offstyle   = Your Holiness|relstyle   = Holy Father|deathstyle = Saint}}===Decree of Valentinian===[[File:Priest celebrating Mass at Altar of Leo I in St</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|Priest celebrating Mass at Altar of Leo the Great in St</span>
				<span class='text'>Peter's Basilica]]Leo was a significant contributor to the centralisation of spiritual authority within the Church and in reaffirming papal authority</span>
				<span class='text'>The bishop of Rome had gradually become viewed as the chief patriarch in the Western church</span>
				<span class='text'>Leo would push that authority into a new realm</span>
				<span class='text'>Not without serious opposition did he succeed in asserting his authority in Gaul</span>
				<span class='text'>Patroclus of Arles (d</span>
				<span class='text'>426) had received from [[Pope Zosimus]] the recognition of a subordinate [[primate (bishop)|primacy]] over the Gallican Church which was strongly asserted by his successor [[Hilary of Arles]]</span>
				<span class='text'>An appeal from Chelidonius of Besançon gave Leo the opportunity to assert the pope's authority over Hilary, who defended himself stoutly at Rome, refusing to recognize Leo's judicial status</span>
				<span class='text'>Feeling that the primatial rights of the bishop of Rome were threatened, Leo appealed to the civil power for support, and obtained from [[Valentinian III]] the famous decree of 6 June 445, which recognized the primacy of the bishop of Rome based on the merits of Peter, the dignity of the city, and the legislation of the [[First Council of Nicaea]]; and provided for the forcible extradition by provincial governors of any bishop who refused to answer a summons to Rome</span>

				<span class='text'>24]&lt;/ref&gt; Faced with this decree, Hilary submitted to the pope, although under his successor, [[Ravennius]], Leo divided the metropolitan rights between Arles and Vienne (450)</span>
				<span class='text'>==Dispute with Dioscorus of Alexandria===In 445, Leo disputed with [[Dioscorus of Alexandria|Patriarch Dioscorus]], St Cyril's successor as [[Patriarch of Alexandria]], insisting that the ecclesiastical practice of his see should follow that of Rome on the basis that [[Mark the Evangelist]], the disciple of [[St Peter]] and founder of the Alexandrian Church, could have had no other tradition than that of the prince of the apostles</span>
				<span class='text'> This, of course, was not the position of the [[Copts]], who saw the ancient patriarchates as equals</span>
				<span class='text'>==Other regions===Regarding Africa, the fact that the African province of [[Mauretania Caesariensis]] had been preserved to the empire and thus to the [[Nicene Creed|Nicene]] faith during the [[Vandal]] invasion, and in its isolation was disposed to rest on outside support, gave Leo an opportunity to assert his authority there, which he did decisively in regard to a number of questions of discipline</span>
				<span class='text'>egarding Italy, in a letter to the bishops of [[Campania]], [[Picenum]], and [[Tuscany]] (443) he required the observance of all his precepts and those of his predecessors; and he sharply rebuked the bishops of [[Sicily]] (447) for their deviation from the Roman custom as to the time of [[baptism]], requiring them to send delegates to the Roman synod to learn the proper practice</span>
				<span class='text'>egarding Greece, because of the earlier line of division between the western and eastern parts of the [[Roman Empire]], [[Illyria]] was ecclesiastically subject to Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Pope Innocent I]] had constituted the [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] of [[Thessalonica]] his [[vicar]], in order to oppose the growing influence of the [[patriarch of Constantinople]] in the area</span>
				<span class='text'>In a letter of about 446 to a successor bishop of Thessalonica, Anastasius, Leo reproached him for the way he had treated one of the metropolitan bishops subject to him; after giving various instructions about the functions entrusted to Anastasius and stressing that certain powers were reserved to the pope himself, Leo wrote: &quot;The care of the universal Church should converge towards Peter's one seat, and nothing anywhere should be separated from its Head</span>

				<span class='text'>tml Extract from the Acts of the Council]&lt;/ref&gt;==Battling heresies==An uncompromising foe of [[heresy]], Leo found that in the diocese of [[Aquileia]], [[Pelagianism|Pelagians]] were received into church communion without formal repudiation of their errors; he wrote to rebuke them, making accusations of culpable negligence, and required a solemn [[abjuration]] before a [[synod]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[Manicheism|Manichaeans]] fleeing before the [[Vandals]] had come to Rome in 439 and secretly organized there; Leo learned of this around 443, and proceeded against them by holding a public debate with their representatives, burning their books{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}, and warning the Roman Christians against them</span>
				<span class='text'>or was his attitude less decided against the [[Priscillian]]ists</span>
				<span class='text'>Bishop [[Turibius of Astorga]], astonished at the spread of this sect in [[Spain]], had addressed the other Spanish bishops on the subject, sending a copy of his letter to Leo, who took the opportunity to exercise Roman policy in Spain</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote an extended treatise (21 July 447), against the sect, examining its false teaching in detail, and calling for a Spanish general council to investigate whether it had any adherents in the episcopate, but this was prevented by the political circumstances of Spain</span>
				<span class='text'>=The ''Tome''=={{Main|Leo's Tome}}At the [[Second Council of Ephesus]] in 449, Leo's representatives delivered his famous ''Tome'' (Latin text, a letter), or statement of the faith of the Roman Church in the form of a letter addressed to [[Archbishop Flavian of Constantinople]], which repeats, in close adherence to [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], the formulas of western [[Christology]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The council did not read the letter, and paid no attention to the protests of Leo's legates, but deposed Flavian and [[Eusebius of Dorylaeum]], who appealed to Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>Partially due to this, the council was never recognized as ecumenical, and was later repudiated by the Council of Chalcedon</span>
				<span class='text'>t was presented again at the subsequent Council of Chalcedon as offering a solution to the Christological controversies still raging between East and West</span>
				<span class='text'>This time it was read out</span>
				<span class='text'>The acts of the council report: &quot;After the reading of the foregoing epistle, the most reverend bishops cried out: This is the faith of the fathers, this is the faith of the Apostles</span>
				<span class='text'>So we all believe, thus the orthodox believe</span>
				<span class='text'>Anathema to him who does not thus believe</span>
				<span class='text'>Peter has spoken thus through Leo</span>
				<span class='text'>So taught the Apostles</span>
				<span class='text'>Piously and truly did Leo teach, so taught Cyril</span>
				<span class='text'>Everlasting be the memory of Cyril</span>
				<span class='text'>Leo and Cyril taught the same thing, anathema to him who does not so believe</span>
				<span class='text'>This is the true faith</span>
				<span class='text'>Those of us who are orthodox thus believe</span>
				<span class='text'>This is the faith of the fathers</span>
				<span class='text'>Why were not these things read at Ephesus? These are the things Dioscorus hid away</span>

				<span class='text'>246]&lt;/ref&gt;==Politics of East and West==Leo demanded of the emperor that an [[ecumenical]] council should be held in Italy, and in the meantime, at a Roman synod in October 449, repudiated all the decisions of the &quot;[[Robber Synod]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Without going into a critical examination of its dogmatic decrees, in his letters to the emperor and others he demanded the deposition of Eutyches as a [[Manichaean]] and [[Docetic]] heretic</span>
				<span class='text'>ith the death of [[Theodosius II]] in 450 and the sudden change in the Eastern situation, [[Patriarch Anatolius of Constantinople|Anatolius]], the new patriarch of Constantinople fulfilled Leo's requirements, and his ''Tome'' was everywhere read and recognized</span>
				<span class='text'>eo was now no longer desirous of having a council, especially since it was not to be held in Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, it was called to meet at Nicaea, then subsequently transferred to [[Chalcedon]], where his legates held at least an honorary presidency, and where the bishops recognized him as the interpreter of the voice of Peter and as the head of their body, requesting of him the confirmation of their decrees</span>
				<span class='text'>e firmly declined to confirm their disciplinary arrangements, which seemed to allow Constantinople a practically equal authority with Rome and regarded the civil importance of a city as a determining factor in its ecclesiastical position; but he strongly supported its dogmatic decrees, especially when, after the accession of [[Leo I the Thracian]] (457), there seemed to be a disposition toward compromise with the Eutychians</span>
				<span class='text'>e succeeded in having an imperial patriarch, and not the [[Oriental Orthodox]] [[Pope Timothy II of Alexandria|Pope Timotheus Aelurus]], chosen as [[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox Pope of Alexandria]] on the murder of [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Alexandria|Greek Patriarch]] [[Proterius of Alexandria]]</span>

				<span class='text'>=Leo and Attila==[[Image:Leoattila-Raphael</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|260px|[[Raffaello Santi|Raphael]]'s ''The Meeting between Leo the Great and Attila'' depicts Leo, escorted by [[Saint Peter]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]], meeting with the [[Hun]] king outside Rome]]Despite his defeat at the [[Battle of Chalons]] in 451, [[Attila the Hun|Attila]] invaded [[Italy]] in 452, sacking cities such as [[Sack of Aquileia|Aquileia]] and heading for Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>He allegedly demanded that the sister of the reigning Emperor Valentinian III be sent to him with a dowry</span>
				<span class='text'>In response, the emperor sent three envoys to negotiate with Attila: [[Gennadius Avienus]], one of the [[Roman consul|consul]]s of 450, Memmius Aemilius Trygetius, the former [[urban prefect]], and Leo</span>
				<span class='text'>Little is known of the specifics of the negotiations, as a result of which Attila withdrew</span>
				<span class='text'>Most ancient and medieval historians celebrated Leo's actions, giving him all the credit for this successful embassy</span>
				<span class='text'>According to [[Prosper of Aquitaine]] who was alive at the time of the event, Attila was so impressed by Leo that he withdrew</span>

				<span class='text'>du/halsall/source/attila2</span>
				<span class='text'>tml Medieval Sourcebook: Leo I and Attila]&lt;/ref&gt; Another near-contemporary was the historian [[Priscus]] who records that Attila was dissuaded from attacking Rome by his own men because they feared he would share the fate of the Visigothic king [[Alaric I|Alaric]], who died shortly after sacking the city in 410</span>

				<span class='text'>107]&lt;/ref&gt; Paul the Deacon, in the late 8th century, relates that an enormously huge man dressed in priestly robes and armed with a naked sword, visible only to Attila, threatened him and his army with death during his discourse with Leo, and this prompted Attila to submit to his request</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Paul the Deacon, Historia Romana 14</span>
				<span class='text'>2&lt;/ref&gt;More modern historians debate other possible reasons for Attila's sudden withdrawal</span>
				<span class='text'>The pope may have offered Attila a large sum of gold or Attila may have had logistical and strategic concerns: an army probably laden with booty from plunder; a plague in northern Italy; food shortages; military actions of the Eastern Emperor [[Marcianus]] on the Danube frontier</span>
				<span class='text'>Besides, the whereabouts of Aëtius at that time are unknown, and Attila or his warriors may have felt endangered by their arch-enemy from the [[Battle of the Catalaunian Plains|Catalaunian plains]]</span>
				<span class='text'>riting in the early 20th century, [[John B</span>
				<span class='text'>Bury]] remarked: &lt;br /&gt;&quot;The fact of the embassy cannot be doubted</span>
				<span class='text'>The distinguished ambassadors visited the Hun's camp near the south shore of [[Lake Garda]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It is also certain that Attila suddenly retreated</span>
				<span class='text'>But we are at a loss to know what considerations were offered him to induce him to depart</span>
				<span class='text'>It is unreasonable to suppose that this heathen king would have cared for the thunders or persuasions of the Church</span>
				<span class='text'>The Emperor refused to surrender [[Justa Grata Honoria|Honoria]], and it is not recorded that money was paid</span>
				<span class='text'>A trustworthy chronicle hands down another account which does not conflict with the fact that an embassy was sent, but evidently furnishes the true reasons which moved Attila to receive it favourably</span>
				<span class='text'>Plague broke out in the barbarian host and their food ran short, and at the same time troops arrived from the east, sent by Marcian to the aid of Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>If his host was suffering from pestilence, and if troops arrived from the east, we can understand that Attila was forced to withdraw</span>
				<span class='text'>But whatever terms were arranged, he did not pretend that they meant a permanent peace</span>
				<span class='text'>The question of Honoria was left unsettled, and he threatened that he would come again and do worse things in Italy unless she were given up with the due portion of the Imperial possessions</span>

				<span class='text'>Leo did, however, assist in rebuilding the city of Rome; restoring key places such as Saint Peter's</span>
				<span class='text'>He died in 461 and, as he wished to be buried as close as possible to the tomb of St Peter, his body was placed in a tomb in the portico of Saint Peter's basilica on 10 November of that year and in 688 was moved inside the basilica itself</span>

				<span class='text'>For there is no proper place for sadness, when we keep the birthday of the Life, which destroys the fear of mortality and brings to us the joy of promised eternity</span>

				<span class='text'>Let the gentile take courage in that he is called to life</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;br&gt;Let us put off then the old man with his deeds: and having obtained a share in the birth of Christ let us renounce the works of the flesh</span>

				<span class='text'>Remember the Head and the Body of which thou art a member</span>
				<span class='text'>Recollect that thou wert rescued from the power of darkness and brought out into God’s light and kingdom</span>
				<span class='text'>By the mystery of Baptism thou wert made the temple of the Holy Ghost: do not put such a denizen to flight from thee by base acts, and subject thyself once more to the devil’s thraldom:  because thy purchase money is the blood of Christ, because He shall judge thee in truth Who ransomed thee in mercy, who with the Father and the Holy Spirit reigns for ever and ever</span>

				<span class='text'>Leo_the_Great_on_the_incarnation]&lt;/ref&gt;}}==Leo's significance==The significance of Leo's pontificate lies in his assertion of the universal jurisdiction of the Roman bishop, as expressed in his letters, and still more in his 96 extant orations</span>
				<span class='text'>This assertion is commonly referred to as the doctrine of [[Petrine supremacy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to Leo and several [[Church Fathers]], as well as certain interpretations of the [[Scriptures]], the Church is built upon Peter, in pursuance of the promise of [[Confession of Peter|Matthew 16:16–19]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Peter participates in everything which is Christ's; what the other apostles have in common with him they have through him</span>
				<span class='text'>What is true of Peter is true also of his successors</span>
				<span class='text'>Every other bishop is charged with the care of his particular flock, the Roman pontiff with that of the whole Church</span>
				<span class='text'>Other bishops are his assistants in this great task</span>
				<span class='text'>In Leo's eyes the decrees of the Council of Chalcedon acquired their validity from his confirmation</span>
				<span class='text'>eo's letters and sermons reflect the many aspects of his career and personality,and are invaluable historical sources</span>
				<span class='text'>His rhythmic prose style, called ''cursus leonicus'', influenced ecclesiastical language for centuries</span>
				<span class='text'>he [[Roman Catholic Church]] marks 10 November as the feast day of Saint Leo, given in the [[Martyrologium Hieronymianum]] and the 8th-century Calendar of Saint Willibrord as the date of his death and entry to heaven</span>
				<span class='text'>His feast was once celebrated in Rome on 28 June, the anniversary of the placing of his relics in [[Saint Peter's Basilica]], but in the 12th century, the [[Gallican Rite]] feast of 11 April was admitted to the [[General Roman Calendar]], which maintained that date until 1969</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Calendarium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana), p</span>
				<span class='text'>107&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[traditionalist Catholic]]s continue to observe pre-1970 versions of that calendar</span>
				<span class='text'>he [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] as well as the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] celebrate Saint Leo on 18 February</span>
				<span class='text'>=Burial==Leo was originally buried in his own monument</span>
				<span class='text'>However, some years after his death, his remains were put into a tomb that contained the first four Pope Leos</span>
				<span class='text'>In the 18th century, Leo the Great's relics were separated from those of the other Leos and he was given his own chapel</span>
