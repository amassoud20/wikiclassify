				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|200px|Johannes Brahms]]'''Johannes Brahms''' ({{IPA-de|joˈhanəs ˈbʁaːms|lang}}; 7 May 1833 – 3 April 1897) was a German composer and pianist</span>
				<span class='text'>Born in [[Hamburg]] into a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] family, Brahms spent much of his professional life in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In his lifetime, Brahms's popularity and influence were considerable</span>
				<span class='text'>He is sometimes grouped with [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] as one of the &quot;[[Three Bs]]&quot;, a comment originally made by the nineteenth-century conductor [[Hans von Bülow]]</span>
				<span class='text'>rahms composed for piano, chamber ensembles, symphony orchestra, and for voice and chorus</span>
				<span class='text'>A virtuoso pianist, he premiered many of his own works</span>
				<span class='text'>He worked with some of the leading performers of his time, including the pianist [[Clara Schumann]] and the violinist [[Joseph Joachim]] (the three were close friends)</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of his works have become staples of the modern concert repertoire</span>
				<span class='text'>Brahms, an uncompromising [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionist]], destroyed some of his works and left others unpublished</span>

				<span class='text'>His music is firmly rooted in the structures and compositional techniques of the Baroque and Classical masters</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a master of [[counterpoint]], the complex and highly disciplined art for which Johann Sebastian Bach is famous, and of [[Musical development|development]], a compositional ethos pioneered by [[Joseph Haydn]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], Ludwig van Beethoven, and other composers</span>
				<span class='text'>Brahms aimed to honour the &quot;purity&quot; of these venerable &quot;German&quot; structures and advance them into a [[Romantic music|Romantic idiom]], in the process creating bold new approaches to harmony and melody</span>
				<span class='text'>While many contemporaries found his music too academic, his contribution and craftsmanship have been admired by subsequent figures as diverse as [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and [[Edward Elgar]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The diligent, highly constructed nature of Brahms's works was a starting point and an inspiration for a generation of composers</span>
				<span class='text'> Within his meticulous structures is embedded, however, a highly romantic nature</span>
				<span class='text'>=Life=====Early years===Brahms's father, Johann Jakob Brahms (1806–72), came to Hamburg from [[Dithmarschen]], seeking a career as a town musician</span>
				<span class='text'>He was proficient on several instruments, but found employment mostly playing the [[natural horn|horn]] and [[double bass]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1830, he married Johanna Henrika Christiane Nissen (1789–1865), a seamstress never previously married, who was seventeen years older than he was</span>
				<span class='text'>Johannes Brahms had an older sister and a younger brother</span>
				<span class='text'>Initially, they lived near the city docks, in the Gängeviertel quarter of Hamburg's [[Neustadt, Hamburg|Neustadt]], for six months, before moving to a small house on the Dammtorwall, a small street near the [[Binnenalster|Inner Alster]]</span>

				<span class='text'>He studied piano from the age of seven with Otto Friedrich Willibald Cossel</span>
				<span class='text'>Owing to the family's poverty, the adolescent Brahms had to contribute to the family's income by playing the piano in dance halls</span>
				<span class='text'>Early biographers found this shocking and played down this portion of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>Some modern writers have suggested that this early experience warped Brahms's later relations with women,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Richard A</span>

				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;9&lt;/ref&gt; After his early piano lessons with Otto Cossel, Brahms studied piano with [[Eduard Marxsen]], who had studied in Vienna with [[Ignaz von Seyfried]] (a pupil of Mozart) and [[Carl Maria von Bocklet]] (a close friend of [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]])</span>
				<span class='text'>The young Brahms gave a few public concerts in Hamburg, but did not become well known as a pianist until he made a concert tour at the age of nineteen</span>
				<span class='text'>(In later life, he frequently took part in the performance of his own works, whether as soloist, accompanist, or participant in chamber music</span>
				<span class='text'> He conducted choirs from his early teens, and became a proficient choral and orchestral conductor</span>
				<span class='text'>==Meeting Joachim and Liszt===[[File:Johannes Brahms 1853</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|Brahms in 1853]]He began to compose quite early in life, but later destroyed most copies of his first works; for instance, {{ill|de|Louise Japha}}, a fellow-pupil of Marxsen, reported a piano sonata, that Brahms had played or improvised at the age of 11, had been destroyed</span>
				<span class='text'>His compositions did not receive public acclaim until he went on a concert tour as accompanist to the Hungarian violinist [[Ede Reményi|Eduard Reményi]] in April and May 1853</span>
				<span class='text'>On this tour he met Joseph Joachim at [[Hanover]], and went on to the Court of [[Weimar]] where he met [[Franz Liszt]], [[Peter Cornelius]], and [[Joachim Raff]]</span>
				<span class='text'>According to several witnesses of Brahms's meeting with Liszt (at which Liszt performed Brahms's [[Scherzo]], Op</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;4, at sight), Reményi was offended by Brahms's failure to praise Liszt's [[Sonata in B minor (Liszt)|Sonata in B minor]] wholeheartedly (Brahms supposedly fell asleep during a performance of the recently composed work), and they parted company shortly afterwards</span>
				<span class='text'>Brahms later excused himself, saying that he could not help it, having been exhausted by his travels</span>
				<span class='text'>==Brahms and the Schumanns===Joachim had given Brahms a letter of introduction to [[Robert Schumann]], and after a walking tour in the [[Rhineland]], Brahms took the train to [[Düsseldorf]], and was welcomed into the Schumann family on arrival there</span>
				<span class='text'>Schumann, amazed by the 20-year-old's talent, published an article entitled &quot;{{lang|de|Neue Bahnen}}&quot; (New Paths) in the 28 October 1853 issue of the journal ''[[Neue Zeitschrift für Musik]]'' alerting the public to the young man, who, he claimed, was &quot;destined to give ideal expression to the times</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;schumannideal&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|first=Robert|last=Schumann|authorlink=Robert Schumann|title=Neue Bahnen|journal=[[Neue Zeitschrift für Musik]]|url=http://de</span>

				<span class='text'>33&lt;/ref&gt; but it was received with some skepticism by others</span>
				<span class='text'>It may have increased Brahms's self-critical need to perfect his works</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote to Robert, &quot;Revered Master,&quot; in November 1853, that his praise &quot;Will arouse such extraordinary expectations by the public that I don't know how I can begin to fulfil them </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;Avins, p</span>
				<span class='text'>24&lt;/ref&gt; While he was in Düsseldorf, Brahms participated with Schumann and [[Albert Dietrich]] in writing a sonata for Joachim; this is known as the &quot;[[F-A-E Sonata|F–A–E Sonata – Free but Lonely]]&quot; ({{Lang-de|links=no|Frei aber einsam}})</span>
				<span class='text'>Schumann's wife, the composer and pianist [[Clara Schumann|Clara]], wrote in her diary about his first visit that Brahms{{quote|is one of those who comes as if straight from God</span>
				<span class='text'>– He played us sonatas, scherzos etc</span>
				<span class='text'>of his own, all of them showing exuberant imagination, depth of feeling, and mastery of form </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>what he played to us is so masterly that one cannot but think that the good God sent him into the world ready-made</span>
				<span class='text'>He has a great future before him, for he will first find the true field for his genius when he begins to write for the orchestra</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Litzmann, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>42–43&lt;/ref&gt;}}After Robert Schumann's attempted suicide and subsequent confinement in a mental sanatorium near [[Bonn]] in February 1854, Clara was &quot;in despair,&quot; expecting the Schumanns' eighth child</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gál, p</span>
				<span class='text'>9&lt;/ref&gt; Brahms hurried to Düsseldorf</span>
				<span class='text'>He and/or Joachim, Dietrich, and [[Julius Otto Grimm]] visited Clara often in March 1854, to divert her mind from Robert's tragedy by playing music for or with her</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Litzmann, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>61–62, 69, 71&lt;/ref&gt; Clara wrote in her diary{{quote|that good Brahms always shows himself a most sympathetic friend</span>
				<span class='text'>He does not say much, but one can see in his face … how he grieves with me for the loved one whom he so highly reveres</span>
				<span class='text'>Besides, he is so kind in seizing every opportunity of cheering me by means of anything musical</span>
				<span class='text'>From so young a man I cannot but be doubly conscious of the sacrifice, for a sacrifice it undoubtedly is for anyone to be with me now</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Litzmann, p</span>
				<span class='text'>69&lt;/ref&gt;}}Later, to help Clara and her many children, Brahms lodged above the Schumann apartment in a three-storey house, setting his musical career aside temporarily</span>
				<span class='text'>Clara was not allowed to visit Robert until two days before his death</span>
				<span class='text'>Brahms was able to visit him several times&lt;ref&gt;Gál, p</span>
				<span class='text'>10&lt;/ref&gt; and so could act as a go-between</span>
				<span class='text'>The Schumanns employed a housekeeper, &quot;Bertha&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Litzmann, p</span>
				<span class='text'>58; she first noticed Robert had left the house, when he went to throw himself into the Rhine&lt;/ref&gt; in Düsseldorf, later Elisabeth Werner in Berlin</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Litzmann, p</span>
				<span class='text'>183&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a hired cook, in Berlin &quot;Josephine</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=Eugenierehouseh&gt;Eugenie Schumann, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>149–150&lt;/ref&gt; When the Schumanns' oldest child and daughter, Marie, born 1841, was of age, she took over as housekeeper and when needed, as cook</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Eugenierehouseh /&gt; Clara was often away on concert tours, some lasting months, or sometimes in the summer for cures, and in 1854–1856 Brahms also was away part of the time, leaving the staff to manage the household</span>
				<span class='text'>Clara much appreciated Brahms's support as a kindred musical spirit</span>
				<span class='text'>n a concert in Leipzig in October 1854, Clara played the Andante and Scherzo from Brahms's [[Piano Sonata No</span>
				<span class='text'>3 (Brahms)|Sonata in F minor]], Op</span>
				<span class='text'>5, &quot;the first time his music was played in public</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Avins, p</span>
				<span class='text'>65</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Brahms and Clara had a very close and lifelong but unusual relationship</span>
				<span class='text'>They had great affection but also respect for one another</span>
				<span class='text'>Brahms urged in 1887 that all his and Clara's letters to each other should be destroyed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Gál, p</span>
				<span class='text'>89&quot;&gt;Gál, p</span>
				<span class='text'>89&lt;/ref&gt; Actually Clara kept quite a number of letters Brahms had sent her, and at Marie's urging, refrained from destroying many of the letters Brahms had returned</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Gál, p</span>
				<span class='text'>89&quot; /&gt; Eventually correspondence between Clara and Brahms in German was published</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;Clara Schumann and Brahms, &quot;Briefe&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Brahms's earliest letters to Clara show him deeply in love with her</span>
				<span class='text'>Clara's preserved letters to Brahms, except for one, begin much later, in 1858</span>
				<span class='text'>Selected letters or excerpts from them, some to or from Brahms, and diary entries of Clara's have been translated into English</span>
				<span class='text'>The earliest excerpted and translated letter from Brahms to Clara was in October 1854</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Litzmann, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>87, 89&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hans Gál]] cautions that the preserved correspondence may have &quot;passed through Clara's censorship</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gál, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>89–90&lt;/ref&gt;Brahms felt a strong conflict between love of Clara and respect for her and Robert, leading him to allude at one point to suicidal thoughts</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gál, p</span>
				<span class='text'>117&lt;/ref&gt; Not long after Robert died, Brahms decided he had to break away from the Schumann household</span>
				<span class='text'>He took leave rather brusquely, leaving Clara feeling hurt</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Eugenie Schumann, p</span>
				<span class='text'>154&lt;/ref&gt; But Brahms and Clara kept up correspondence</span>
				<span class='text'>Brahms joined Clara and some of her children for some summer sojourns</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1862, Clara bought a house in Lichtental, then adjoining, but since 1909 included in [[Baden-Baden]], and lived there with her remaining family from 1863 to 1873</span>
				<span class='text'>Brahms from 1865 to 1874 spent parts of some summers living in an apartment nearby in a house which is now a museum, the &quot;Brahmshaus&quot; (Brahms house)</span>

				<span class='text'>chumann-portal</span>
				<span class='text'>om/baden-baden</span>
				<span class='text'>tml&lt;/ref&gt; Brahms appears in later years as a rather avuncular figure in Eugenie Schumann's account</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Eugenie Schumann, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>141–151, 159–166&lt;/ref&gt; Clara and Brahms took a concert tour together, in November–December 1868 in Vienna, then in early 1869 to England, then Holland; the tour ended in April 1869</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Briefe, Band I, p</span>
				<span class='text'>603, footnote&lt;/ref&gt; After Clara moved from Lichtental to Berlin in 1873, the two saw each other less often, as Brahms had his home in Vienna since 1863</span>
				<span class='text'>lara was 14 years older than Brahms</span>
				<span class='text'>In a letter to her 24 May 1856, two and a half years after meeting her, and after two years either together or corresponding, Brahms wrote that he continued to call her the German polite form &quot;Sie&quot; of &quot;you&quot; and hesitated to use the familiar form &quot;Du</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Briefe, no</span>
				<span class='text'>101&lt;/ref&gt; Clara agreed that they call one another &quot;Du,&quot; writing in her diary &quot;I could not refuse, for indeed I love him like a son&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Litzmann, p</span>
				<span class='text'>94&lt;/ref&gt; Brahms wrote on 31 May:&quot;I wish I could write to you as tenderly as I love you, and do as many good things for you, as you would like</span>
				<span class='text'>You are so infinitely dear to me that I can hardly express it</span>
				<span class='text'>I should like to call you darling and lots of other names, without ever getting enough of adoring you</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=Gal90&gt;Gál, p</span>
				<span class='text'>90&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Briefe, no</span>
				<span class='text'>102</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The rest of that letter, and most later preserved letters, are about music and musical people, updating one another about their travels and experiences</span>
				<span class='text'>Brahms much valued Clara's opinions as a composer</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;There was no composition by Brahms that was not shown to Clara the moment it was in shape to be communicated</span>
				<span class='text'>She remained his faithfully devoted adviser</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gál, p</span>
				<span class='text'>91&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to Joachim in 1859, three years after Robert's death, Brahms wrote about Clara:&quot;I believe that I do not respect and admire her so much as I love her and am under her spell</span>
				<span class='text'>Often I must forcibly restrain myself from just quietly putting my arms around her and even—I don't know, it seems so natural that she would not take it ill</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=Gal90 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gál writes that this letter was not in the published (1908) two volumes of Brahms-Joachim correspondence but was &quot;brought to light by Arthur Holde in ''The Musical Quarterly'' (New York: July, 1959)</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Avins, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>46-48, gives a translation of the whole letter, saying that most of it had been published, but not the just quoted passage, which she says is &quot;restored here [with a little different translation] from the autograph</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt;Brahms never married, despite strong feelings for several women and despite entering into an engagement, soon broken off, with Agathe von Siebold in [[Göttingen]] in 1859</span>
				<span class='text'>It seems that Brahms was rather indiscreet about the relationship while it lasted, which troubled his friends</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Agathe&gt;Gál, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>94-95,&lt;/ref&gt; After breaking off the engagement, Brahms wrote to Agathe: &quot;I love you! I must see you again, but I am incapable of bearing fetters</span>
				<span class='text'>Please write me whether I may come again to clasp you in my arms, to kiss you, and tell you that I love you</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; But they never saw one another again</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Agathe /&gt;===Detmold and Hamburg===After Robert Schumann's death at the sanatorium in 1856, Brahms divided his time between Hamburg, where he formed and conducted a ladies' choir, and [[Detmold]] in the [[Principality of Lippe]], where he was court music-teacher and conductor</span>
				<span class='text'>He was the soloist at the premiere of his [[Piano Concerto No</span>
				<span class='text'>1 (Brahms)|Piano Concerto No</span>
				<span class='text'>1]], his first orchestral composition to be performed publicly, in 1859</span>
				<span class='text'>He first visited Vienna in 1862, staying there over the winter, and, in 1863, was appointed conductor of the [[Wiener Singakademie|Vienna Singakademie]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Though he resigned the position the following year, and entertained the idea of taking up conducting posts elsewhere, he based himself increasingly in Vienna and soon made his home there</span>
				<span class='text'>From 1872 to 1875, he was director of the concerts of the Vienna [[Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde]]; afterwards, he accepted no formal position</span>
				<span class='text'>He declined an honorary doctorate of music from the University of Cambridge in 1877, but accepted one from the [[University of Wrocław|University of Breslau]] in 1879, and composed the ''[[Academic Festival Overture]]'' as a gesture of appreciation</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=May 2015}}He had been composing steadily throughout the 1850s and 60s, but his music had evoked divided critical responses, and the first Piano Concerto had been badly received in some of its early performances</span>
				<span class='text'>His works were labelled old-fashioned by the '[[New German School]]' whose principal figures included Franz Liszt, [[Richard Wagner]], and [[Hector Berlioz]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Brahms admired some of Wagner's music and admired Liszt as a great pianist, but the conflict between the two schools, known as the [[War of the Romantics]], soon embroiled all of musical Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>In the Brahms camp were his close friends: Clara Schumann, Joachim, the influential music critic [[Eduard Hanslick]], and the leading Viennese surgeon [[Theodor Billroth]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1860, Brahms attempted to organize a public protest against some of the wilder excesses of the Wagnerians' music</span>
				<span class='text'>This took the form of a manifesto, written by Brahms and Joachim jointly</span>
				<span class='text'>The manifesto, which was published prematurely with only three supporting signatures, was a failure, and he never engaged in public polemics again</span>

				<span class='text'>This may have given him the confidence finally to complete a number of works that he had wrestled with over many years such as the cantata [[Rinaldo (cantata)|''Rinaldo'']], his first string quartet, third piano quartet, and most notably his first symphony</span>

				<span class='text'>1 (Brahms)|No</span>
				<span class='text'>1 in D minor]]; [[Piano Concerto No</span>
				<span class='text'>2 (Brahms)|No</span>
				<span class='text'>2 in B-flat major]]), a [[Violin Concerto (Brahms)|Violin Concerto]], a [[Double Concerto (Brahms)|Double Concerto]] for violin and cello, and two companion orchestral overtures, the ''Academic Festival Overture'' and the ''[[Tragic Overture]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>is large choral work ''[[A German Requiem (Brahms)|A German Requiem]]'' is not a setting of the liturgical ''Missa pro defunctis'' but a setting of texts which Brahms selected from the [[Luther Bible]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The work was composed in three major periods of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>An early version of the second movement was first composed in 1854, not long after Robert Schumann's attempted suicide, and this was later used in his first piano concerto</span>
				<span class='text'>The majority of the Requiem was composed after his mother's death in 1865</span>
				<span class='text'>The fifth movement was added after the official premiere in 1868, and the work was published in 1869</span>
				<span class='text'>rahms's works in [[variation (music)|variation]] form include, among others, the ''[[Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Handel]]'' and the ''[[Variations on a Theme of Paganini|Paganini Variations]]'', both for solo piano, and the ''[[Variations on a Theme by Haydn]]'' (now sometimes called the ''Saint Anthony Variations'') in versions for two pianos and for orchestra</span>
				<span class='text'>The final movement of the [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>4 (Brahms)|Fourth Symphony]], Op</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;98, is formally a [[passacaglia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>is [[chamber music|chamber]] works include three string quartets, two string quintets, two string sextets, a clarinet quintet, a clarinet trio, a [[Horn Trio (Brahms)|horn trio]], a piano quintet, three piano quartets, and four piano trios (the [[Piano Trio in A major (Brahms)|fourth]] being published posthumously)</span>
				<span class='text'>He composed several instrumental sonatas with piano, including three for violin, two for cello, and two for clarinet (which were subsequently arranged for viola by the composer)</span>
				<span class='text'>His solo piano works range from his early [[piano sonata]]s and [[ballade (classical music)|ballades]] to his late sets of character pieces</span>
				<span class='text'>Brahms was a significant [[Lied]]er composer, who wrote over 200 of them</span>
				<span class='text'>His [[Eleven Chorale Preludes|chorale preludes for organ]], Op</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;122, which he wrote shortly before his death, have become an important part of the organ repertoire</span>
				<span class='text'>rahms was an extreme [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionist]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He destroyed many early works – including a violin sonata he had performed with Reményi and violinist [[Ferdinand David (musician)|Ferdinand David]] – and once claimed to have destroyed 20 string quartets before he issued his official First in 1873</span>
				<span class='text'>Over the course of several years, he changed an original project for a symphony in D minor into his [[Piano Concerto No</span>
				<span class='text'>1 (Brahms)|first piano concerto]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In another instance of devotion to detail, he laboured over the official First Symphony for almost fifteen years, from about 1861 to 1876</span>
				<span class='text'>Even after its first few performances, Brahms destroyed the original slow movement and substituted another before the score was published</span>
				<span class='text'>(A conjectural restoration of the original slow movement has been published by Robert Pascall</span>
				<span class='text'>Another factor that contributed to Brahms's perfectionism was that Schumann had announced early on that Brahms was &quot;destined to give ideal expression to the times&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;schumannideal&quot;/&gt; a prediction that Brahms was determined to live up to</span>
				<span class='text'>This prediction hardly added to the composer's self-confidence, and may have contributed to the delay in producing the First Symphony</span>
				<span class='text'>rahms strongly preferred writing [[absolute music]] that does not refer to an explicit scene or narrative, and he never wrote an opera or a symphonic poem</span>
				<span class='text'>espite his reputation as a serious composer of large, complex musical structures, some of Brahms's most widely known and most commercially successful compositions during his life were small-scale works of popular intent aimed at the thriving contemporary market for domestic music-making</span>
				<span class='text'>During the 20th century, the influential American critic [[B</span>
				<span class='text'>H</span>
				<span class='text'>Haggin]], rejecting more mainstream views, argued in his various guides to recorded music that Brahms was at his best in such works and much less successful in larger forms</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} Among the most cherished of these lighter works by Brahms are his sets of popular dances, the ''[[Hungarian Dances (Brahms)|Hungarian Dances]]'', the ''Waltzes'' for piano duet (Op</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;39), and the ''[[Liebeslieder Walzer, Op</span>
				<span class='text'>52 (Brahms)|Liebeslieder Waltzes]]'' for vocal quartet and piano, and some of his many songs, notably the ''Wiegenlied'' (Op</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;49, No</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;4, published in 1868)</span>
				<span class='text'>This last was written (to a folk text) to celebrate the birth of a son to Brahms's friend Bertha Faber and is universally known as ''[[Brahms's Lullaby]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>==Style and influences===[[File:Johannes Brahms portrait</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|left|Brahms in mid-career]]Brahms maintained a classical sense of form and order in his works, in contrast to the opulence of the music of many of his contemporaries</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, many admirers (though not necessarily Brahms himself) saw him as the champion of traditional forms and &quot;pure music&quot;, as opposed to the &quot;New German&quot; embrace of [[programme music]]</span>
				<span class='text'>rahms venerated Beethoven; in the composer's home, a marble bust of Beethoven looked down on the spot where he composed, and some passages in his works are reminiscent of Beethoven's style</span>
				<span class='text'>Brahms's [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>1 (Brahms)|First Symphony]] bears strongly the influence of Beethoven's [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphony]], as the two works are both in [[C&amp;nbsp;minor]] and end in the struggle towards a [[C&amp;nbsp;major]] triumph</span>
				<span class='text'>The main theme of the finale of the First Symphony is also reminiscent of the main theme of the finale of Beethoven's [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>9 (Beethoven)|Ninth]], and when this resemblance was pointed out to Brahms he replied that any dunce&lt;ref&gt;Brahms used the German word &quot;Esel&quot;, of which one translation is &quot;donkey&quot; and another is &quot;dunce&quot;: ''Cassell's New German Dictionary'', Funk and Wagnalls, New York and London, 1915&lt;/ref&gt; could see that</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1876, when the work was premiered in Vienna, it was immediately hailed as &quot;Beethoven's Tenth&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the similarity of Brahms's music to that of late Beethoven had first been noted as early as November 1853 in a letter from [[Albert Dietrich]] to [[Ernst Naumann]]</span>

				<span class='text'>He once wrote that the Requiem &quot;belonged to Schumann&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The first movement of this abandoned symphony was re-worked as the first movement of the First Piano Concerto</span>
				<span class='text'>rahms loved the classical composers Mozart and Haydn</span>
				<span class='text'>He collected first editions and autographs of their works and edited performing editions</span>
				<span class='text'>He studied the music of pre-classical composers, including [[Giovanni Gabrieli]], [[Johann Adolph Hasse]], [[Heinrich Schütz]], [[Domenico Scarlatti]], [[George Frideric Handel]], and, especially, [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His friends included leading musicologists, and, with [[Friedrich Chrysander]], he edited an edition of the works of [[François Couperin]]</span>

				<span class='text'>he early Romantic composers had a major influence on Brahms, particularly Schumann, who encouraged Brahms as a young composer</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The latter's influence may be identified in works by Brahms dating from the period, such as the two piano quartets Op</span>

				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;26, and the [[Piano Quintet (Brahms)|Piano Quintet]] which alludes to Schubert's [[String Quintet (Schubert)|String Quintet]] and [[Sonata in C major for piano four-hands, D 812 (Schubert)|Grand Duo]] for piano four hands</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The influence of [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]] and [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]] on Brahms is less obvious, although occasionally one can find in his works what seems to be an allusion to one of theirs (for example, Brahms's Scherzo, Op</span>

				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;310–311</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Brahms considered giving up composition when it seemed that other composers' innovations in extended tonality would result in the rule of tonality being broken altogether</span>
				<span class='text'>Although [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] became fiercely critical of Brahms as the latter grew in stature and popularity, he was enthusiastically receptive of the early ''Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Handel''; Brahms himself, according to many sources,&lt;ref&gt;Swafford (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; deeply admired Wagner's music, confining his ambivalence only to the dramaturgical precepts of Wagner's theory</span>
				<span class='text'>rahms wrote settings for piano and voice of 144 German folk songs, and many of his lieder reflect folk themes or depict scenes of rural life</span>
				<span class='text'>His ''Hungarian Dances'' were among his most profitable compositions</span>
				<span class='text'>==Influence===Brahms's point of view looked both backward and forward; his output was often bold in its exploration of harmony and rhythm</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, he was an influence on composers of both conservative and modernist tendencies</span>
				<span class='text'>Within his lifetime, his idiom left an imprint on several composers within his personal circle, who strongly admired his music, such as [[Heinrich von Herzogenberg]], [[Robert Fuchs]], and [[Julius Röntgen]], as well as on [[Gustav Jenner]], who was Brahms's only formal composition pupil</span>
				<span class='text'>Antonín Dvořák, who received substantial assistance from Brahms, deeply admired his music and was influenced by it in several works, such as the [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>7 (Dvořák)|Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>7 in D minor]] and the F minor Piano Trio</span>
				<span class='text'>Features of the &quot;Brahms style&quot; were absorbed in a more complex synthesis with other contemporary (chiefly Wagnerian) trends by [[Hans Rott]], [[Wilhelm Berger]], [[Max Reger]] and [[Franz Schmidt]], whereas the British composers [[Hubert Parry]] and [[Edward Elgar]] and the Swede [[Wilhelm Stenhammar]] all testified to learning much from Brahms's example</span>
				<span class='text'>As Elgar said, &quot;I look at the Third Symphony of Brahms, and I feel like a pygmy</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Brahms'' (1990), p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;406</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;[[Ferruccio Busoni]]'s early music shows much Brahmsian influence, and Brahms took an interest in him, though Busoni later tended to disparage Brahms</span>
				<span class='text'>Towards the end of his life, Brahms offered substantial encouragement to [[Ernő Dohnányi]] and to [[Alexander von Zemlinsky]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Their early chamber works (and those of [[Béla Bartók]], who was friendly with Dohnányi) show a thoroughgoing absorption of the Brahmsian idiom</span>
				<span class='text'>Zemlinsky, moreover, was in turn the teacher of Arnold Schoenberg, and Brahms was apparently impressed by two movements of Schoenberg's early [[String quartets (Schoenberg)|Quartet in D major]] which Zemlinsky showed him</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1933, Schoenberg wrote an essay &quot;Brahms the Progressive&quot; (re-written 1947), which drew attention to Brahms's fondness for motivic saturation and irregularities of rhythm and phrase; in his last book (''Structural Functions of Harmony'', 1948), he analysed Brahms's &quot;enriched harmony&quot; and exploration of remote tonal regions</span>
				<span class='text'>These efforts paved the way for a re-evaluation of Brahms's reputation in the 20th century</span>
				<span class='text'>Schoenberg went so far as to orchestrate one of Brahms's piano quartets</span>
				<span class='text'>Schoenberg's pupil [[Anton Webern]], in his 1933 lectures, posthumously published under the title ''The Path to the New Music'', claimed Brahms as one who had anticipated the developments of the [[Second Viennese School]], and Webern's own Op</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;1, an orchestral [[passacaglia]], is clearly in part a homage to, and development of, the variation techniques of the passacaglia-finale of Brahms's Fourth Symphony</span>
				<span class='text'>rahms was honoured in the German hall of fame, the [[Walhalla memorial]]</span>
				<span class='text'>On 14 September 2000, he was introduced there as the 126th &quot;''rühmlich ausgezeichneter Teutscher''&quot; and 13th composer among them, with a bust by sculptor {{ill|de|Milan Knobloch}}</span>

				<span class='text'>He often brought penny candy with him to hand out to children</span>
				<span class='text'>To adults Brahms was often brusque and sarcastic, and he often alienated other people</span>
				<span class='text'>His pupil Gustav Jenner wrote, &quot;Brahms has acquired, not without reason, the reputation for being a grump, even though few could also be as lovable as he</span>

				<span class='text'>Those who remained his friends were very loyal to him, however, and he reciprocated with equal loyalty and generosity</span>
				<span class='text'>rahms had amassed a small fortune in the second half of his career, around 1860, when his works sold widely, but despite his wealth, he lived very simply, with a modest apartment, a mess of music papers and books, and a single housekeeper who cleaned and cooked for him</span>
				<span class='text'>He was often the butt of jokes for his long beard, his cheap clothes and often not wearing socks</span>
				<span class='text'>Brahms gave away large sums of money to friends and to aid various musical students, often with the term of strict secrecy</span>
				<span class='text'>Brahms' domicile was hit during World War II, destroying his piano and other possessions that were still kept there for posterity by the Viennese</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|[[Johann Strauss II]] (left) and Johannes Brahms (right) photographed in Vienna]]Brahms was a lifelong friend of [[Johann Strauss II]], though they were very different as composers</span>
				<span class='text'>Brahms even struggled to get to the [[Theater an der Wien]] in Vienna for the premiere of Strauss's operetta ''Die Göttin der Vernunft'' in March 1897 before his death</span>
				<span class='text'>Perhaps the greatest tribute that Brahms paid to Strauss was his remark that he would have given anything to have written ''[[The Blue Danube]]'' [[waltz]]</span>
				<span class='text'>An old anecdote recounts that when Strauss's wife Adele asked Brahms to autograph her fan, he wrote the first few notes of the &quot;Blue Danube&quot; waltz, and then wrote the words &quot;Unfortunately not by Johannes Brahms!&quot; underneath</span>
				<span class='text'>==Religious beliefs===Brahms' personal views tended to be humanistic and skeptical, though one of his influences was undoubtedly the Bible as rendered in German by [[Martin Luther]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His Requiem employs biblical texts primarily to speak words of comfort to the bereaved, yet it also cites Hebrews 13:14 (&quot;here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come&quot;) and 1 Corinthians 15:51–52 (&quot;the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>Composer [[Walter Niemann (composer)|Walter Niemann]] declared &quot;The fact that Brahms began his creative activity with the German folk song and closed with the Bible reveals</span>

				<span class='text'>On the other hand, I have chosen one thing or another because I am a musician, because I needed it, and because with my venerable authors I can't delete or dispute anything</span>
