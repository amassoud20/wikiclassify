				<span class='text'>His performance in ''No Way Out'', as a doctor treating a Caucasian bigot (played by [[Richard Widmark]]), was noticed and led to more roles, each considerably more interesting and more prominent than those most African American actors of the time were offered</span>

				<span class='text'>oitier began to be criticized for being typecast as over-idealized African American characters who were not permitted to have any sexuality or personality faults, such as his character in ''Guess Who's Coming To Dinner''</span>
				<span class='text'>Poitier was aware of this pattern himself, but was conflicted on the matter</span>
				<span class='text'>He wanted more varied roles; but he also felt obliged to set an example with his characters, by challenging old stereotypes as he was the only major actor of African descent being cast in leading roles in the American film industry, at that time</span>
