				<span class='text'>In collaboration with [[Frederick Loewe]], and later [[Burton Lane]], he created some of the world's most popular and enduring works of [[musical theatre]] for both the stage and on film</span>
				<span class='text'>He won three [[Tony Award]]s and three [[Academy Award]]s, among other honors</span>
				<span class='text'>=Biography==Born in [[New York City]], he was the son of Edith Adelson Lerner and Joseph Jay Lerner, whose brother, Samuel Alexander Lerner, was founder and owner of the [[Lerner Stores]], a chain of dress shops</span>
				<span class='text'>One of Lerner's cousins was the radio comedian/television game show panelist [[Henry Morgan (comedian)|Henry Morgan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Lerner was educated at [[Bedales School]] in England, [[Choate Rosemary Hall|The Choate School]] (now Choate Rosemary Hall) in Wallingford, Connecticut, (where he wrote &quot;The Choate Marching Song&quot;) and [[Harvard University|Harvard]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He attended both [[Camp Androscoggin]] and [[Camp Greylock]]</span>

				<span class='text'>om, accessed August 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Like [[Cole Porter]] at [[Yale]] and [[Richard Rodgers]] at [[Columbia University|Columbia]], his career in musical theater began with his collegiate contributions, in Lerner's case to the annual Harvard [[Hasty Pudding Theatricals|Hasty Pudding]] musicals</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Green, p</span>
				<span class='text'>38&lt;/ref&gt; During the summers of 1936 and 1937, Lerner studied music composition at [[Juilliard]]</span>
				<span class='text'>While attending Harvard, he lost his sight in his left eye due to an accident in the boxing ring</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1957, Lerner and [[Leonard Bernstein]], another of Lerner's college classmates, collaborated on &quot;Lonely Men of Harvard,&quot; a tongue-in-cheek salute to their alma mater</span>
				<span class='text'>ue to his injury, Lerner could not serve in [[World War II]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead he wrote [[radio]] scripts, including ''[[Your Hit Parade]]'', until he was introduced to [[Austria]]n composer [[Frederick Loewe]], who needed a partner, in 1942 at the [[Lamb's Club]]</span>
				<span class='text'>While at the Lamb's, he also came upon [[Lorenz Hart]], and he helped transform Lerner into his protégé</span>
				<span class='text'>{cn|date=July 2015}}Lerner and Loewe's first collaboration was a musical adaptation of Barry Conners's farce ''The Patsy'' called ''Life of the Party'' for a [[Detroit]] [[Stock company (acting)|stock company]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The lyrics were mostly written by Earle Crooker, but he had left the project, with the score needing vast improvement</span>
				<span class='text'>It enjoyed a nine-week run and encouraged the duo to join forces with Arthur Pierson for ''[[What's Up? (musical)|What's Up?]]'', which opened on Broadway in 1943</span>
				<span class='text'>It ran for 63 performances and was followed two years later by ''[[The Day Before Spring]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Green, p</span>
				<span class='text'>239&lt;/ref&gt;Their first hit was ''[[Brigadoon (musical)|Brigadoon]]'' (1947), a romantic fantasy set in a mystical Scottish village, directed by [[Robert Lewis (actor)|Robert Lewis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It was followed in 1951 by the less successful [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush]] story ''[[Paint Your Wagon (musical)|Paint Your Wagon]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>{cn|date=July 2015}}Lerner worked with [[Kurt Weill]] on the stage musical ''[[Love Life (musical)|Love Life]]'' (1948) and [[Burton Lane]] on the movie musical ''[[Royal Wedding]]'' (1951)</span>
				<span class='text'>In that same year Lerner also wrote the [[Academy Awards|Oscar-winning]] original [[screenplay]] for ''[[An American in Paris (Movie)|An American in Paris]]'', produced by [[Arthur Freed]] and directed by [[Vincente Minnelli]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This was the same team who would later join with Lerner and Loewe to create ''[[Gigi (1958 film)|Gigi]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1956, Lerner and Loewe unveiled ''[[My Fair Lady]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Before finishing the musical, Lerner was eager to write while ''My Fair Lady'' was taking so long to complete</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Burton Lane]] and Lerner were working on a musical about [[Li'l Abner]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Gabriel Pascal]] owned the rights to ''Pygmalion'', which had been unsuccessful with other composers who tried to adapt it into a musical</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Arthur Schwartz]] and [[Howard Dietz]] first tried, and then [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Oscar Hammerstein II]] attempted, but gave up and Hammerstein told Lerner &quot;'''Pygmalion''' had no subplot&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Lerner and Loewe's adaptation of [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'' retained his social commentary and added appropriate songs for the characters of Henry Higgins and Liza Doolittle, played originally by [[Rex Harrison]] and [[Julie Andrews]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It set box-office records in [[New York]] and [[London]]</span>
				<span class='text'>When brought to the screen in 1964, the movie version would win eight [[Academy Awards|Oscars]], including Best Picture and Best Actor for [[Rex Harrison]]</span>
				<span class='text'>erner and Loewe's run of success continued with their next project, a film adaptation of stories from [[Colette]], the [[Academy Award]] winning film musical ''[[Gigi (1958 film)|Gigi]]'', starring [[Leslie Caron]], [[Louis Jourdan]] and [[Maurice Chevalier]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The film won all of its nine Oscar nominations, a record at that point in time, and a special Oscar for co-star Maurice Chevalier</span>
				<span class='text'>he Lerner-Loewe partnership cracked under the stress of producing the Arthurian ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]'' in 1960, with Loewe resisting Lerner's desire to direct as well as write when original director [[Moss Hart]] suffered a heart attack in the last few months of rehearsals, and would die shortly after the show's premiere</span>
				<span class='text'>Lerner was hospitalized with [[bleeding ulcer]]s while Loewe continued to have heart troubles</span>
				<span class='text'>''Camelot'' was a hit nonetheless, with a poignant coda; immediately following the assassination of [[John F</span>
				<span class='text'>Kennedy]], his widow told ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine that JFK's administration reminded her of the &quot;one brief shining moment&quot; of Lerner and Loewe's ''Camelot''</span>
				<span class='text'>To this day, ''Camelot'' is invoked to describe the [[idealism]], [[Romanticism|romance]], and [[tragedy]] of the Kennedy years</span>
				<span class='text'>{cn|date=July 2015}}Loewe retired to [[Palm Springs, California]] while Lerner went through a series of  musicals,some successful,some not, with such composers as [[André Previn]] (''[[Coco (musical)|Coco]]''), [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]] (''[[Lolita, My Love]]''), [[Leonard Bernstein]] (''[[1600 Pennsylvania Avenue (musical)|1600 Pennsylvania Avenue]]''), [[Burton Lane]] (''[[Carmelina]]'') and [[Charles Strouse]] (''[[Dance a Little Closer]]'', based on the film, ''[[Idiot's Delight (film)|Idiot's Delight]]'', nicknamed ''Close A Little Faster'' by Broadway wags because it closed on opening night)</span>
				<span class='text'>Most biographers{{who|date=July 2015}} blame Lerner's professional decline on the lack of a strong director with whom Lerner could collaborate, as [[Neil Simon]] did with [[Mike Nichols]] or [[Stephen Sondheim]] with [[Harold Prince]] ([[Moss Hart]], who had directed ''[[My Fair Lady]],'' died shortly after ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]'' opened)</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1965 Lerner collaborated again with [[Burton Lane]] on the musical ''[[On a Clear Day You Can See Forever]]'', which was adapted for film in 1970</span>
				<span class='text'>At this time, Lerner was hired by film producer [[Arthur P</span>
				<span class='text'>Jacobs]] to write a treatment for an upcoming film project, ''[[Doctor Dolittle (film)|Doctor Dolittle]]'', but Lerner abrogated his contract after several non-productive months of non-communicative procrastination and was replaced with [[Leslie Bricusse]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harris|first=Mark|title=Pictures at a Revolution|year=2008|publisher=Penguin Press|pages=77–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lerner was inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1971</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1973, Lerner coaxed Fritz Loewe out of retirement to augment the ''Gigi'' score for a [[Gigi (musical)|musical stage adaptation]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The following year they collaborated on a musical film version of ''[[The Little Prince (1974 film)|The Little Prince]]'', based on the classic children's tale by [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This film was a critical and box office failure, but has gained a modern following</span>
				<span class='text'>{cn|date=July 2015}}Lerner's autobiography ''The Street Where I Live'' (1978), was an account of three of his and Loewe's successful collaborations, ''My Fair Lady'', ''Gigi'', and ''Camelot'' along with personal information</span>
				<span class='text'>In the last year of his life he published ''The Musical Theatre:  A Celebration'', a well-reviewed history of the theatre replete with personal anecdotes and his trademark wit</span>
				<span class='text'>{cn|date=July 2015}} A book of Lerner's lyrics entitled ''A Hymn To Him'', edited by British writer [[Benny Green (saxophonist)|Benny Green]], was published in 1987</span>
				<span class='text'>t the time of Lerner's death, he had just begun to write lyrics for ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'', and was replaced by [[Charles Hart (lyricist)|Charles Hart]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also had been working with [[Gerard Kenny]] and [[Kristi Kane (libretto)]] in London on a musical version of the classic film ''[[My Man Godfrey]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>He received an urgent call from [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] who wanted him to write the lyrics to ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'', for which he wrote &quot;[[Masquerade (The Phantom of the Opera song)|Masquerade]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He then informed Webber that he wanted to leave the project, as he was losing his memory (due to an undiagnosed brain tumor)</span>

				<span class='text'>The show ran for only 10 days at the [[Herbst Theatre]] in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Personal life==Lerner's personal foibles were the stuff of tabloid legend</span>
				<span class='text'>For nearly twenty years he battled an [[amphetamine]] [[Substance use disorder|addiction]]; during the 1960s he was a patient of [[Max Jacobson]], known as &quot;Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Feelgood&quot;, who administered injections of &quot;vitamins with enzymes&quot; that were in fact laced with amphetamines</span>
				<span class='text'>Lerner's addiction is believed to have been the result of Jacobson's  practice</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Lerner had four children: three daughters, Susan (by Boyd), Liza and Jennifer (by Olson); and one son, screenwriter and journalist [[Michael Alan Lerner]] (by di Borgo)</span>
				<span class='text'>=Songwriting=={{refimprove section|date=July 2015}}Lerner would often struggle with writing his lyrics</span>
				<span class='text'>He was surprisingly able to complete &quot;[[I Could Have Danced All Night]]&quot; from ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' in one 24 hour period</span>
				<span class='text'>He usually spent months on one song and was constantly rewriting them</span>
				<span class='text'>Lerner was said to have insecurity about his talent</span>
				<span class='text'>He would sometimes write songs with someone in mind, for instance, &quot;[[I've Grown Accustomed To Her Face]]&quot; from ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' was written with [[Rex Harrison]] in mind to complement his very limited vocal range</span>
				<span class='text'>erner said of writing:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;You have to keep in mind that there is no such thing as realism or naturalism in the theater</span>
				<span class='text'>That is a myth</span>
				<span class='text'>If there was realism in the theater, there would never be a third act</span>
				<span class='text'>Nothing ends that way</span>
				<span class='text'>A man's life is made up of thousands and thousands of little pieces</span>
				<span class='text'>In writing fiction, you select 20 or 30 of them</span>
				<span class='text'>In a musical, you select even fewer than that</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &quot;First, we decide where a song is needed in a play</span>
				<span class='text'>Second, what is it going to be about? Third, we discuss the mood of the song</span>
				<span class='text'>Fourth, I give (Loewe) a title</span>
				<span class='text'>Then he writes the music to the title and the general feeling of the song is established</span>
				<span class='text'>After he's written the melody, then I write the lyrics</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; &lt;/blockquote&gt;In a 1979 interview on [[NPR]]'s ''[[All Things Considered]]'', Lerner went into some depth about his lyrics for ''[[My Fair Lady]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Professor Henry Higgins sings, &quot;Look at her, a prisoner of the gutters / Condemned by every syllable she utters / By right she should be taken out and hung / For the cold-blooded murder of the English tongue</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Lerner said he knew the lyric used incorrect grammar for the sake of a rhyme</span>
				<span class='text'>He was later approached about it by another famous lyricist:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I thought, oh well, maybe nobody will notice it, but not at all</span>
				<span class='text'>Two nights after it opened, I ran into [[Noël Coward]] in a restaurant, and he walked over and he said, &quot;Dear boy, it is ''hanged'', not ''hung''</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; I said, &quot;Oh, Noel, I know it, I know it! You know, shut up!&quot; So, and there's another, &quot;Than to ever let a woman in my life</span>
