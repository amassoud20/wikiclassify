				<span class='text'>n 8 January 1913, Tolkien travelled by train to Cheltenham and was met on the platform by Edith</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Tolkien found himself commanding  enlisted men who were drawn mainly from the mining, milling, and weaving towns of Lancashire</span>

				<span class='text'>148–149</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;According to John Garth,  Tolkien &quot;felt an affinity for these working class men&quot;,  but military protocol forbade him from developing friendships with &quot;other ranks&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, he was required to &quot;take charge of them, discipline them, train them, and probably censor their letters</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>If possible, he was supposed to inspire their love and loyalty</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Garth (2003), page 149</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Tolkien later lamented, &quot;The most improper job of any man</span>

				<span class='text'>To get around the [[British Army]]'s [[postal censorship]], the Tolkiens developed a secret code for his letters home</span>
				<span class='text'>By using the code, Edith could track her husband's movements on a map of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]</span>

				<span class='text'>After his wife's death in 1971, Tolkien remembered, &lt;blockquote&gt;I never called Edith ''Luthien'' – but she was the source of the story that in time became the chief part of the ''Silmarillion''</span>
				<span class='text'>It was first conceived in a small woodland glade filled with hemlocks&lt;ref&gt;Following rural English usage, Tolkien used the name &quot;hemlock&quot; for various plants with white flowers in umbels, resembling [[poison hemlock|hemlock]] (''Conium maculatum''); the flowers Edith danced among were more probably [[cow parsley]] (''Anthriscus sylvestris'') or [[wild carrot]] (''Daucus carota'')</span>

(The first word of this and several other Old English poems), which some undergraduates took to be 'Quiet!' It was not so much a recitation as a dramatic performance, an impersonation of an Anglo-Saxon bard in a mead hall, and it impressed generations of students because it brought home to them that ''Beowulf'' was not just a set text to be read for the purposes of examination, but a powerful piece of dramatic poetry</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;According to his grandson [[Simon Tolkien]], Tolkien in the last years of his life was disappointed by some of the liturgical reforms and changes implemented after the [[Second Vatican Council]]:  &lt;blockquote&gt;I vividly remember going to church with him in [[Bournemouth]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a devout Roman Catholic and it was soon after the Church had changed the [[liturgy]] from Latin to English</span>
				<span class='text'>My grandfather obviously didn't agree with this and made all the responses very loudly in Latin while the rest of the congregation answered in English</span>
				<span class='text'>I found the whole experience quite excruciating, but my grandfather was oblivious</span>
				<span class='text'>He simply had to do what he believed to be right</span>

				<span class='text'>quot; (Other critics such as [[Tom Shippey]] and [[Michael D</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Drout]] disagree with such clear-cut generalizations of Tolkien's &quot;white&quot; and &quot;dark&quot; men into good and bad</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;====Opposition to National Socialism====Tolkien vocally opposed [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]] prior to the [[Second World War]], and was known to especially despise [[Nazi]] racist and anti-Semitic ideology</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1938, the publishing house Rütten &amp; Loening Verlag was preparing to release ''The Hobbit'' in [[Nazi Germany]]</span>
				<span class='text'>To Tolkien's outrage, he was asked beforehand whether he was of [[Aryan race|Aryan]] origin</span>
				<span class='text'>In a letter to his British publisher [[Stanley Unwin (publisher)|Stanley Unwin]], he condemned Nazi &quot;race-doctrine&quot; as &quot;wholly pernicious and unscientific&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He added that he had many [[Jewish]] friends and was considering &quot;letting a German translation go hang&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no</span>
				<span class='text'>29, to Stanley Unwin, 25 July 1938</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He provided two letters to Rütten &amp; Loening and instructed Unwin to send whichever he preferred</span>
				<span class='text'>The more tactful letter was sent and was lost during the later bombing of Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>In the unsent letter, Tolkien makes the point that &quot;[[Aryan]]&quot; is a linguistic term, denoting speakers of [[Indo-Iranian languages]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He continued,&lt;blockquote&gt; But if I am to understand that you are enquiring whether I am of ''Jewish'' origin, I can only reply that I regret that I appear to have ''no'' ancestors of that gifted people</span>
				<span class='text'>My great-great-grandfather came to England in the 18th century from Germany: the main part of my descent is therefore purely English, and I am an English subject—which should be sufficient</span>
				<span class='text'>I have been accustomed, nonetheless, to regard my German name with pride, and continued to do so throughout the period of the late regrettable war, in which I served in the English army</span>
				<span class='text'>I cannot, however, forbear to comment that if impertinent and irrelevant inquiries of this sort are to become the rule in matters of literature, then the time is not far distant when a German name will no longer be a source of pride</span>

				<span class='text'>30</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In a 1941 letter to his son Michael, he expressed his resentment at the distortion of Germanic history in &quot;Nordicism&quot;:&lt;blockquote&gt;You have to understand the good in things, to detect the real evil</span>
				<span class='text'>But no one ever calls on me to 'broadcast' or do a postscript</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet I suppose I know better than most what is the truth about this 'Nordic' nonsense</span>
				<span class='text'>Anyway, I have in this war a burning private grudge</span>

				<span class='text'>45</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In 1968, he objected to a description of Middle-earth as &quot;[[Nordic race|Nordic]]&quot;, a term he said he disliked because of its association with [[Nordic theory|racialist theories]]</span>

				<span class='text'>294</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;====Total war====Tolkien criticized Allied use of [[total war]] tactics against civilians from [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Imperial Japan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In a 1945 letter to his son Christopher, he wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;We were supposed to have reached a stage of civilization in which it might still be necessary to execute a criminal, but not to gloat, or to hang his wife and child by him while the orc-crowd hooted</span>
				<span class='text'>The destruction of Germany, be it 100 times merited, is one of the most appalling world-catastrophes</span>
				<span class='text'>Well, well,—you and I can do nothing about it</span>
				<span class='text'>And that [should] be a measure of the amount of guilt that can justly be assumed to attach to any member of a country who is not a member of its actual Government</span>
				<span class='text'>Well the first War of the Machines seems to be drawing to its final inconclusive chapter—leaving, alas, everyone the poorer, many bereaved or maimed and millions dead, and only one thing triumphant: the Machines</span>

				<span class='text'>96</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;He also reacted with anger at the excesses of [[Anti-German sentiment|anti-German]] propaganda during the war</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1944, he wrote in a letter to his son Christopher:&lt;blockquote&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>it is distressing to see the press grovelling in the gutter as low as Goebbels in his prime, shrieking that any German commander who holds out in a desperate situation (when, too, the military needs of his side clearly benefit) is a drunkard, and a besotted fanatic</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>There was a solemn article in the local paper seriously advocating systematic exterminating of the entire German nation as the only proper course after military victory: because, if you please, they are rattlesnakes, and don't know the difference between good and evil! (What of the writer?) The Germans have just as much right to declare the Poles and Jews exterminable vermin, subhuman, as we have to select the Germans: in other words, no right, whatever they have done</span>

				<span class='text'>He cites many examples in ''The Lord of the Rings'', such as Sauron's &quot;Lidless Eye&quot;: &quot;the black slit of its pupil opened on a pit, a window into nothing</span>

				<span class='text'>Shippey contends that this Christian view of evil is most clearly stated by Boethius: &quot;evil is nothing</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Another interesting argument is Stratford Caldecott's theological view on the Ring and what it represents</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;The Ring of Power exemplifies the dark magic of the corrupted will, the assertion of self in disobedience to God</span>
				<span class='text'>It appears to give freedom, but its true function is to enslave the wearer to the Fallen Angel</span>
				<span class='text'>It corrodes the human will of the wearer, rendering him increasingly &quot;thin&quot; and unreal; indeed, its gift of invisibility symbolizes this ability to destroy all natural human relationships and identity</span>
				<span class='text'>You could say the Ring is sin itself: tempting and seemingly harmless to begin with, increasingly hard to give up and corrupting in the long run&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>The essay remains highly influential in the study of Old English literature to this day</span>
				<span class='text'>''Beowulf'' is one of the most significant influences upon Tolkien's later fiction, with major details of both ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' being adapted from the poem</span>
				<span class='text'>The piece reveals many of the aspects of ''Beowulf'' which Tolkien found most inspiring, most prominently the role of monsters in literature, particularly that of the dragon which appears in the final third of the poem:&lt;blockquote&gt;As for the poem, one dragon, however hot, does not make a summer, or a host; and a man might well exchange for one good dragon what he would not sell for a wilderness</span>

				<span class='text'>''Roverandom'' and ''Smith of Wootton Major'', like ''The Hobbit'', borrowed ideas from his ''legendarium''</span>
				<span class='text'>===''The Hobbit''====Tolkien never expected his stories to become popular, but by sheer accident a book called ''[[The Hobbit]]'', which he had written some years before for his own children, came in 1936 to the attention of Susan Dagnall, an employee of the London publishing firm [[George Allen &amp; Unwin]], who persuaded Tolkien to submit it for publication</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes obit&quot;/&gt; However, the book attracted adult readers as well as children, and it became popular enough for the publishers to ask Tolkien to produce a sequel</span>
				<span class='text'>===''The Lord of the Rings''====The request for a sequel prompted Tolkien to begin what would become his most famous work: the epic novel ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (originally published in three volumes 1954–1955)</span>
				<span class='text'>Tolkien spent more than ten years writing the primary narrative and appendices for ''The Lord of the Rings'', during which time he received the constant support of the [[Inklings]], in particular his closest friend [[C</span>

				<span class='text'>Lewis]], the author of ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Both ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' are set against the background of ''The Silmarillion'', but in a time long after it</span>

				<span class='text'>It tells the story of Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Bliss and his first ride in his new motor-car</span>
				<span class='text'>Many adventures follow: encounters with bears, angry neighbours, irate shopkeepers, and assorted collisions</span>
				<span class='text'>The story was inspired by Tolkien's own vehicular mishaps with his first car, purchased in 1932</span>
				<span class='text'>The bears were based on toy bears owned by Tolkien's sons</span>
				<span class='text'>Tolkien was both author and illustrator of the book</span>
				<span class='text'>He submitted it to his publishers as a balm to readers who were hungry for more from him after the success of ''The Hobbit''</span>

The beginning of the Quenya poem [[Namárië]] written in [[Tengwar]] and in [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] script]]Parallel to Tolkien's professional work as a philologist, and sometimes overshadowing this work, to the effect that his academic output remained rather thin, was his affection for [[constructed languages|constructing languages]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The most developed of these are [[Quenya]] and [[Sindarin]], the etymological connection between which formed the core of much of Tolkien's ''legendarium''</span>
				<span class='text'>Language and grammar for Tolkien was a matter of [[aesthetics]] and [[euphony]], and Quenya in particular was designed from &quot;phonaesthetic&quot; considerations; it was intended as an &quot;Elvenlatin&quot;, and was phonologically based on Latin, with ingredients from Finnish, Welsh, English, and Greek</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; A notable addition came in late 1945 with [[Adûnaic]] or [[Númenórean]], a language of a &quot;faintly [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] flavour&quot;, connected with Tolkien's [[Atlantis]] legend, which by ''[[The Notion Club Papers]]'' ties directly into his ideas about the inability of language to be inherited, and via the &quot;[[Second Age]]&quot; and the story of [[Eärendil]] was grounded in the ''legendarium'', thereby providing a link of Tolkien's 20th-century &quot;real primary world&quot; with the legendary past of his Middle-earth</span>
				<span class='text'>olkien considered languages inseparable from the mythology associated with them, and he consequently took a dim view of [[International auxiliary language|auxiliary languages]]: in 1930 a congress of Esperantists were told as much by him, in his lecture ''[[A Secret Vice]]'', &quot;Your language construction will breed a mythology&quot;, but by 1956 he had concluded that &quot;[[Volapük]], [[Esperanto]], [[Ido (language)|Ido]], [[Novial]], &amp;c, &amp;c, are dead, far deader than ancient unused languages, because their authors never invented any Esperanto legends&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The popularity of Tolkien's books has had a small but lasting effect on the use of language in fantasy literature in particular, and even on mainstream dictionaries, which today commonly accept Tolkien's idiosyncratic spellings ''dwarves'' and ''dwarvish'' (alongside ''dwarfs'' and ''dwarfish''), which had been little used since the mid-19th century and earlier</span>
				<span class='text'>(In fact, according to Tolkien, had the [[Old English]] plural survived, it would have been ''dwarrows'' or ''dwerrows''</span>
				<span class='text'> He also coined the term ''[[eucatastrophe]]'', though it remains mainly used in connection with his own work</span>

				<span class='text'>vg|thumb|Tolkien rarely signed his works and his autograph has become highly valued by collectors</span>
				<span class='text'>]Unlike other authors of the genre, Tolkien never favoured signing his works</span>
				<span class='text'>Owing to his popularity, handsigned copies of his letters or of the first editions of his individual writings have however achieved high values at auctions, and forged autographs may occur on the market</span>
				<span class='text'>In particular, the signed first hardback edition of ''The Hobbit'' from 1937 has reportedly been offered for $85,000</span>
