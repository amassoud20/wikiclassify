				<span class='text'>As a strong advocate of Swaraj, he was against [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]]'s policy of Total-[[ahimsa]] (non-violence), satyagraha and advocated the use of force where necessary</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;He organised the [[Deccan Education Society]] with a few of his college friends, including [[Gopal Ganesh Agarkar]], Mahadev Ballal Namjoshi and [[Vishnushastri Chiplunkar]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Their goal was to improve the quality of education for India's youth</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Deccan Education Society]] was set up to create a new system that taught young Indians nationalist ideas through an emphasis on Indian culture</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;== Political career ==Tilak had a long political career agitating for Indian autonomy from the British rule</span>
				<span class='text'>Before Gandhi, he was the most widely known Indian political leader</span>
				<span class='text'>Unlike his fellow Maharashtrian contemporary, [[Gopal Krishna Gokhale|Gokhale]], Tilak was considered a radical leader and was imprisoned on a number of occasions that included a long stint at Mandalay</span>
				<span class='text'>At one stage in his political life he was called &quot;the father of Indian unrest&quot; by the British authorities</span>
				<span class='text'>Towards the end of his life, Tilak became more moderate and campaigned for Indian Home rule with leaders like [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah|Jinnah]] and [[Annie Beasant]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==Indian National Congress===Tilak joined the [[Indian National Congress]] in 1890</span>
				<span class='text'>He opposed its moderate attitude, especially towards the fight for self-government</span>
				<span class='text'>He was one of the most-eminent radicals at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Despite being personally opposed to early marriage, Tilak was against the 1891 [[1891 Age of Consent Act|Age of Consent bill]], seeing it as interference with Hinduism and a dangerous precedent</span>
				<span class='text'>The act raised the age at which a girl could get married from 10 to 12 years</span>
				<span class='text'>During late 1896, a Bubonic [[Mumbai plague epidemic|plague]] spread from [[Bombay]] to [[Pune]], and by January 1897, it reached epidemic proportions</span>
				<span class='text'>British troops were brought in to deal with the emergency and harsh measures were employed including forced entry into private houses, examination of occupants, evacuation to hospitals and segregation camps, removing and destroying personal possessions, and preventing patients from entering or leaving the city</span>
				<span class='text'>By the end of May, the epidemic was under control</span>
				<span class='text'>ven if, though the British authorities' measures were well-meant, they were widely regarded as acts of tyranny and oppression</span>
				<span class='text'>Tilak took up this issue by publishing inflammatory articles in his paper ''[[Kesari (newspaper)|Kesari]]'' (''Kesari'' was written in [[Marathi language|Marathi]], and ''Mahratta'' was written in English), quoting the Hindu scripture, the [[Bhagavad Gita]], to say that no blame could be attached to anyone who killed an oppressor without any thought of reward</span>
				<span class='text'>Following this, on 22 June 1897, Commissioner Rand and another British officer, Lt</span>
				<span class='text'>Ayerst were shot and killed by the [[Chapekar brothers]] and their other associates</span>
				<span class='text'>According to [[Barbara Metcalf|Barbara]] and [[Thomas R</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;Following the [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|Partition of Bengal]], which was a strategy set out by [[Lord Curzon]] to weaken the nationalist movement, Tilak encouraged the [[Swadeshi movement]] and the Boycott movement</span>

				<span class='text'>The Swadeshi movement consisted of the usage of natively produced goods</span>
				<span class='text'>Once foreign goods were boycotted, there was a gap which had to be filled by the production of those goods in India itself</span>
				<span class='text'>Tilak said that the Swadeshi and Boycott movements are two sides of the same coin</span>
				<span class='text'>ilak opposed the moderate views of [[Gopal Krishna Gokhale]], and was supported by fellow Indian nationalists [[Bipin Chandra Pal]] in [[Bengal]] and [[Lala Lajpat Rai]] in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]]</span>
				<span class='text'>They were referred to as the &quot;[[Lal Bal Pal|Lal-Bal-Pal]] [[triumvirate]]&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Trouble broke out over the selection of the new president of the Congress between the moderate and the radical sections of the party </span>

				<span class='text'>The jury by a majority of 7:2 convicted him</span>
				<span class='text'>On being asked by the judge whether he had anything to say, Tilak said: &lt;blockquote&gt; All that I wish to say is that, in spite of the verdict of the jury, I still maintain that I am innocent</span>
				<span class='text'> There are higher powers that rule the destinies of men and nations; and I think, it may be the will of Providence that the cause I represent may be benefited more by my suffering than by my pen and tongue</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/blockquote&gt;In passing sentence, the judge indulged in some scathing strictures against Tilak's conduct</span>
				<span class='text'>He threw off the judicial restraint which, to some extent, was observable in his charge to the jury</span>
				<span class='text'>He condemned the articles as &quot;seething with sedition&quot;, as preaching violence, speaking of murders with approval</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; While imprisoned, he continued to read and write, further developing his ideas on the Indian nationalist movement</span>
				<span class='text'>While in the prison he wrote the ''[[Shrimadh Bhagvad Gita Rahasya|Gita Rahasya]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>This and the general ordeal of prison life had mellowed him at his release on 16 June 1914</span>
				<span class='text'> When [[World War I]] started in August of that year, Tilak cabled the King-Emperor [[George V]] of his support and turned his oratory to find new recruits for war efforts</span>
				<span class='text'>He welcomed The Indian Councils Act, popularly known as [[Minto-Morley Reforms]], which had been passed by British Parliament in May 1909, terming it as &quot;a marked increase of confidence between the Rulers and the Ruled&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>It was his conviction that acts of violence actually diminished, rather than hastening, the pace of political reforms</span>
				<span class='text'>He was eager for reconciliation with Congress and had abandoned his demand for direct action and settled for agitations &quot;strictly by constitutional means&quot; – a line advocated by his rival Gokhale</span>
