				<span class='text'>Domitian was the third and last emperor of the [[Flavian dynasty]]</span>
				<span class='text'>omitian's youth and early career were largely spent in the shadow of his brother [[Titus]], who gained military renown during the [[First Jewish–Roman War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This situation continued under the rule of his father [[Vespasian]], who became emperor in 69 following the [[civil war]] known as the [[Year of the Four Emperors]]</span>
				<span class='text'>While Titus held a great many offices under the rule of his father, Domitian was left with honours but no responsibilities</span>
				<span class='text'>Vespasian died in 79 and was succeeded by Titus, whose own reign came to an unexpected end when he was struck by a fatal illness in 81</span>
				<span class='text'>The following day Domitian was declared Emperor by the [[Praetorian Guard]], commencing a reign that lasted fifteen years&amp;nbsp;– longer than any man who had ruled since [[Tiberius]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;cf</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Roman Emperor (Principate)]] although several came within a year or two of 15-year reigns&lt;/ref&gt;As Emperor, Domitian strengthened the economy by revaluing the [[Roman currency|Roman coinage]], expanded the border defenses of the Empire, and initiated a massive building program to restore the damaged city of [[Rome]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Significant wars were fought in Britain, where his general [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola|Agricola]] attempted to conquer [[Caledonia]] ([[Scotland]]), and in [[Dacia]], where Domitian was unable to procure a decisive victory against king [[Decebalus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Domitian's government exhibited [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] characteristics; he saw himself as the new [[Augustus]], an enlightened despot destined to guide the Roman Empire into a new era of brilliance</span>
				<span class='text'>Religious, military, and cultural [[propaganda]] fostered a [[cult of personality]], and by nominating himself perpetual [[Roman censor|censor]], he sought to control public and private morals</span>
				<span class='text'>As a consequence, Domitian was popular with the people and army but considered a tyrant by members of the [[Roman Senate]]</span>
				<span class='text'>omitian's reign came to an end in 96 when he was assassinated by court officials</span>
				<span class='text'>The same day he was succeeded by his advisor [[Nerva]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After his death, Domitian's memory was [[damnatio memoriae|condemned to oblivion]] by the Roman Senate, while senatorial authors such as [[Tacitus]], [[Pliny the Younger]] and [[Suetonius]] published histories propagating the view of Domitian as a cruel and paranoid tyrant</span>
				<span class='text'>Modern revisionists have instead characterized Domitian as a ruthless but efficient autocrat whose cultural, economic and political program provided the foundation of the peaceful 2nd century</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;jones-domitian-1&quot;&gt;Jones (1992), p</span>

				<span class='text'>62&lt;/ref&gt;Decades of civil war during the 1st century BC had contributed greatly to the demise of the old aristocracy of Rome, which a new Italian nobility gradually replaced in prominence during the early part of the 1st century</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;jones-domitian-3&quot;&gt;Jones (1992), p</span>
				<span class='text'>3&lt;/ref&gt; One such family, the Flavians, or ''gens [[Flavia (gens)|Flavia]]'', rose from relative obscurity to prominence in just four generations, acquiring wealth and status under the emperors of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Domitian's great-grandfather, [[Titus Flavius Petro]], had served as a [[centurion]] under [[Pompey]] during [[Caesar's civil war]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His military career ended in disgrace when he fled the battlefield at the [[Battle of Pharsalus]] in 48 BC</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;jones-domitian-1&quot;/&gt;Nevertheless, Petro managed to improve his status by marrying the extremely wealthy Tertulla, whose fortune guaranteed the upwards mobility of Petro's son [[Titus Flavius Sabinus (father of Vespasian)|Titus Flavius Sabinus I]], Domitian's grandfather</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;jones-domitian-2&quot;&gt;Jones (1992), p</span>
				<span class='text'>2&lt;/ref&gt; Sabinus himself amassed further wealth and possible [[equestrian (Roman)|equestrian]] status through his services as [[tax collector]] in Asia and banker in [[Helvetia]] (modern Switzerland)</span>
				<span class='text'>By marrying [[Vespasia Polla]] he allied the Flavian family to the more prestigious ''gens Vespasia'', ensuring the elevation of his sons [[Titus Flavius Sabinus (consul 47)|Titus Flavius Sabinus II]] and Vespasian to [[Roman Senate|senatorial]] rank</span>

				<span class='text'>tml#4 4]&lt;/ref&gt; Modern history has refuted these claims, suggesting these stories later circulated under Flavian rule as part of a [[propaganda]] campaign to diminish success under the less reputable Emperors of the Julio-Claudian dynasty and to maximize achievements under Emperor Claudius (41–54) and his son [[Britannicus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jones (1992), p</span>
				<span class='text'>7&lt;/ref&gt;By all appearances, the Flavians enjoyed high imperial favour throughout the 40s and 60s</span>
				<span class='text'>While Titus received a court education in the company of Britannicus, Vespasian pursued a successful political and military career</span>
				<span class='text'>Following a prolonged period of retirement during the 50s, he returned to public office under Nero, serving as [[proconsul]] of the [[Africa Province|Africa province]] in 63, and accompanying the emperor during an official tour of [[Greece]] in 66</span>

				<span class='text'>Vespasian was assigned to lead the [[Roman army]] against the insurgents, with Titus — who had completed his military education by this time — in charge of a legion</span>

				<span class='text'>52–53&lt;/ref&gt; while his father and brother were continuously active in the Roman military, commanding armies in [[Germania]] and Judaea</span>
				<span class='text'>For Domitian, this meant that a significant part of his adolescence was spent in the absence of his near relatives</span>
				<span class='text'>During the Jewish-Roman wars, he was likely taken under the care of his uncle Titus Flavius Sabinus II, at the time serving as [[Praefectus urbi|city prefect]] of Rome; or possibly even [[Nerva|Marcus Cocceius Nerva]], a loyal friend of the Flavians and the future successor to Domitian</span>

				<span class='text'>his ambiguity of character was further exacerbated by his remoteness, and as he grew older, he increasingly displayed a preference for solitude, which may have stemmed from his isolated upbringing</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;jones-domitian-13&quot;/&gt; Indeed, by the age of eighteen nearly all of his closest relatives had died by war or disease</span>

				<span class='text'>[[Batavians|Batavian]] auxiliaries of the [[Rhine]] legions, led by [[Gaius Julius Civilis]], had rebelled with the aid of a faction of [[Treveri]] under the command of [[Julius Classicus]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=jones-33/&gt; Despite its initial recklessness, the alliance was very prestigious for both families</span>
				<span class='text'>Domitia Longina was the younger daughter of [[Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo]], a respected general and honoured politician</span>
				<span class='text'>Following the failed [[Pisonian conspiracy]] against Nero in 65, he had been forced to commit suicide</span>
				<span class='text'>The new marriage not only re-established ties to senatorial opposition, but also served the broader Flavian propaganda of the time, which sought to diminish Vespasian's political success under Nero</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead connections to Claudius and Britannicus were emphasised, and Nero's victims, or those otherwise disadvantaged by him, rehabilitated</span>

				<span class='text'>22&lt;/ref&gt; By moving the centre of government (more or less formally) to the imperial [[court]], Domitian openly rendered the Senate's powers obsolete</span>

				<span class='text'>]{{Main|Roman conquest of Britain}}One of the most detailed reports of military activity under the Flavian dynasty was written by Tacitus, whose biography of his father-in-law Gnaeus Julius Agricola largely concerns the conquest of Britain between 77 and 84</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=jones-132&gt;Jones (1992), p</span>
				<span class='text'>132&lt;/ref&gt; He had given refuge to an exiled Irish king whom he hoped he might use as the excuse for conquest</span>

				<span class='text'>307/525804 }}&lt;/ref&gt;Turning his attention from Ireland, the following year Agricola raised a fleet and pushed beyond the [[River Forth|Forth]] into Caledonia</span>
				<span class='text'>To aid the advance, a large legionary fortress was constructed at [[Inchtuthil]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=jones-132/&gt; In the summer of 84, Agricola faced the armies of the Caledonians, led by [[Calgacus]], at the [[Battle of Mons Graupius]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=jones-132/&gt;In 85, Agricola was recalled to Rome by Domitian, having served for more than six years as governor, longer than normal for consular legates during the Flavian era</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=jones-132/&gt; Tacitus claims that Domitian ordered his recall because Agricola's successes outshone the Emperor's own modest victories in Germania</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=tacitus-agricola-39/&gt; The relationship between Agricola and the Emperor is unclear: on the one hand, Agricola was awarded triumphal decorations and a statue, on the other, Agricola never again held a civil or military post in spite of his experience and renown</span>
				<span class='text'>He was offered the governorship of the province of Africa but declined it, either due to ill health or, as Tacitus claims, the machinations of Domitian</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=tacitus-agricola-24-3&gt;Tacitus, ''Agricola'' [[s:Agricola#42|42]]&lt;/ref&gt;Not long after Agricola's recall from Britain, the Roman Empire entered into war with the [[Dacia|Kingdom of Dacia]] in the East</span>
				<span class='text'>Reinforcements were needed, and in 87 or 88, Domitian ordered a large-scale strategic [[Withdrawal (military)|withdrawal]] of troops in the British province</span>
				<span class='text'>The fortress at Inchtuthil was dismantled and the Caledonian forts and watchtowers abandoned, moving the Roman frontier some 120&amp;nbsp;kilometres (75&amp;nbsp;mi) further south</span>

				<span class='text'>vg|thumb|The Roman province of [[Dacia]] (purple area) after the conquest of Trajan in 106, with the [[Black Sea]] to the far right</span>
				<span class='text'>]The most significant threat the Roman Empire faced during the reign of Domitian arose from the northern provinces of Illyricum, where the Suebi, the Sarmatians and the Dacians continuously harassed Roman settlements along the Danube river</span>
				<span class='text'>Of these, the Sarmatians and the Dacians posed the most formidable threat</span>
				<span class='text'>In approximately 84 or 85 the Dacians, led by King [[Decebalus]], crossed the Danube into the province of [[Moesia]], wreaking havoc and killing the Moesian governor [[Oppius Sabinus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=jones-138&gt;Jones (1992), p</span>
				<span class='text'>138&lt;/ref&gt;Domitian quickly launched a [[counterattack|counteroffensive]], personally travelling to the region accompanied by a large force commanded by his praetorian prefect [[Cornelius Fuscus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Fuscus successfully drove the Dacians back across the border in mid-85, prompting Domitian to return to Rome and celebrate his second triumph</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=jones-139&gt;Jones (1992), p</span>
				<span class='text'>139&lt;/ref&gt;The victory proved short-lived, however: as early in 86 Fuscus embarked on an ill-fated expedition into Dacia, which resulted in the complete destruction of the fifth legion, [[Legio V Alaudae]], in the [[First Battle of Tapae]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Fuscus was killed, and the [[Aquila (Roman)|battle standard]] of the Praetorian Guard was lost</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=jones-141&gt;Jones (1992), p</span>
				<span class='text'>141&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of the battle standard, or ''aquila'', was indicative of a crushing defeat and a serious affront to Roman national pride</span>
				<span class='text'>omitian returned to Moesia in August 86</span>
				<span class='text'>He divided the province into Lower Moesia and Upper Moesia, and transferred three additional legions to the Danube</span>
				<span class='text'>In 87, the Romans invaded Dacia once more, this time under the command of [[Tettius Julianus]], and finally defeated Decebalus in late 88 at the same site where Fuscus had previously perished</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=jones-142&gt;Jones (1992), p</span>
				<span class='text'>142&lt;/ref&gt; An attack on the Dacian capital [[Sarmizegetusa Regia|Sarmizegetusa]] was forestalled when new troubles arose on the German frontier in 89</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=jones-150&gt;Jones (1992), p</span>
				<span class='text'>150&lt;/ref&gt;In order to avert having to conduct a war on two fronts, Domitian agreed to terms of peace with Decebalus, negotiating free access of Roman troops through the Dacian region while granting Decebalus an annual subsidy of 8 million sesterces</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=jones-150&gt;Jones (1992), p</span>
				<span class='text'>150&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary authors severely criticized this treaty, which was considered shameful to the Romans and left the deaths of Sabinus and Fuscus unavenged</span>

				<span class='text'>195&lt;/ref&gt; For the remainder of Domitian's reign Dacia remained a relatively peaceful [[client state|client kingdom]], but Decebalus used the Roman money to fortify his defenses</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Salmon/&gt;Domitian probably wanted a new war against the Dacians, and reinforced Upper Moesia with two more cavalry units brought from Syria and with at least five cohorts brought from Pannonia</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Trajan]] continued Domitian's policy and added two more units to the auxiliary forces of Upper Moesia, and then he used the build up of troops for his Dacian wars</span>

				<span class='text'>307/283229 }}&lt;/ref&gt;===Religious policy===Domitian firmly believed in the traditional [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]], and personally saw to it that ancient customs and morals were observed throughout his reign</span>
				<span class='text'>In order to justify the divine nature of the Flavian rule, Domitian emphasized connections with the chief deity [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]],&lt;ref name=jones-99/&gt; perhaps most significantly through the impressive restoration of the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill</span>
				<span class='text'>A small [[chapel]] dedicated to ''Jupiter Conservator'' was also constructed near the house where Domitian had fled to safety on 20 December 69</span>
				<span class='text'>Later in his reign, he replaced it with a more expansive building, dedicated to ''Jupiter Custos''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=jones-88&gt;Jones (1992), p</span>
				<span class='text'>88&lt;/ref&gt;The goddess he worshipped the most zealously, however, was [[Minerva]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Not only did he keep a personal shrine dedicated to her in his bedroom, she regularly appeared on his coinage—in four different attested reverse types—and he founded a legion, Legio I Minervia, in her name</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=jones-100&gt;Jones (1992), p</span>
				<span class='text'>100&lt;/ref&gt;Domitian also revived the practice of the [[imperial cult (ancient Rome)|imperial cult]], which had fallen somewhat out of use under Vespasian</span>
				<span class='text'>Significantly, his first act as an Emperor was the deification of his brother Titus</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon their deaths, his infant son, and niece, Julia Flavia, were likewise enrolled among the gods</span>
				<span class='text'>With regards to the emperor himself as a religious figure, both Suetonius and [[Cassius Dio]] allege that Domitian officially gave himself the title of ''Dominus et Deus''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Domitian'', 13:2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dio, ''Roman History'', 67:4:7&lt;/ref&gt; However, not only did he reject the title of ''Dominus'' during his reign,&lt;ref name=jones-108&gt;Jones (1992), p</span>
				<span class='text'>108&lt;/ref&gt; but since he issued no official documentation or coinage to this effect, historians such as Brian Jones contend that such phrases were addressed to Domitian by flatterers who wished to earn favors from the emperor</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=jones-109&gt;Jones (1992), p</span>
				<span class='text'>109&lt;/ref&gt;To foster the worship of the imperial family, he erected a dynastic [[mausoleum]] on the site of Vespasian's former house on the [[Quirinal Hill|Quirinal]],&lt;ref name=jones-87&gt;Jones (1992), p</span>
				<span class='text'>87&lt;/ref&gt; and completed the Temple of Vespasian and Titus, a shrine dedicated to the worship of his deified father and brother</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=jones-93/&gt; To memorialize the military triumphs of the Flavian family, he ordered the construction of the Templum Divorum and the Templum Fortuna Redux, and completed the Arch of Titus</span>
				<span class='text'>onstruction projects such as these constituted only the most visible part of Domitian's religious policy, which also concerned itself with the fulfilment of religious law and public morals</span>
				<span class='text'>In 85, he nominated himself perpetual censor, the office that held the task of supervising Roman morals and conduct</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=jones-106&gt;Jones (1992), p</span>
				<span class='text'>106&lt;/ref&gt; Once again, Domitian acquitted himself of this task dutifully, and with care</span>
				<span class='text'>He renewed the ''[[Lex Julia|Lex Iulia de Adulteriis Coercendis]]'', under which adultery was punishable by exile</span>
				<span class='text'>From the list of jurors he struck an equestrian who had divorced his wife and taken her back, while an ex-quaestor was expelled from the Senate for acting and dancing</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=jones-107/&gt;Domitian also heavily prosecuted corruption among public officials, removing jurors if they accepted bribes and rescinding legislation when a [[conflict of interest]] was suspected</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=jones-107/&gt; He ensured that [[libel]]lous writings, especially those directed against himself, were punishable by exile or death</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=jones-107/&gt; Actors were likewise regarded with suspicion, as their performances provided an opportunity for [[satire]] at the expense of the government</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Grainger (2003), p</span>
				<span class='text'>54&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, he forbade [[mime]]s from appearing on stage in public</span>
				<span class='text'>n 87, [[Vestal Virgin]]s were found to have broken their sacred vows of lifelong public chastity</span>
				<span class='text'>As the Vestals were regarded as daughters of the community, this offense essentially constituted [[incest]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Accordingly, those found guilty of any such transgression were condemned to death, either by a manner of their choosing, or according to the ancient fashion, which dictated that Vestals should be [[Premature burial|buried alive]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=jones-101&gt;Jones (1992), p</span>
				<span class='text'>101&lt;/ref&gt;Foreign religions were tolerated insofar as they did not interfere with public order, or could be assimilated with the traditional Roman religion</span>
				<span class='text'>The worship of Egyptian deities in particular flourished under the Flavian dynasty, to an extent not seen again until the reign of [[Commodus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Veneration of [[Serapis]] and Isis, who were identified with Jupiter and Minerva respectively, was especially prominent</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=jones-100/&gt;4th century writings by [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] maintain that Jews and [[Christianity|Christians]] were heavily [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire#Under Domitian|persecuted]] toward the end of Domitian's reign</span>

				<span class='text'>]On 1 January 89, the governor of [[Germania Superior]], [[Lucius Antonius Saturninus]], and his two legions at [[Mainz]], [[Legio XIV Gemina]] and [[Legio XXI Rapax]], revolted against the Roman Empire with the aid of the Germanic Chatti people</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=jones-144/&gt; The precise cause for the rebellion is uncertain, although it appears to have been planned well in advance</span>

				<span class='text'>The [[Roman governors of Germania Inferior|governor of Germania Inferior]], Lappius Maximus, moved to the region at once, assisted by the procurator of [[Rhaetia]], Titus Flavius Norbanus</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=jones-146&gt;Jones (1992), p</span>
				<span class='text'>146&lt;/ref&gt; Within twenty-four days the rebellion was crushed, and its leaders at Mainz savagely punished</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=jones-149&gt;Jones (1992), p</span>
				<span class='text'>149&lt;/ref&gt;Lappius Maximus received the governorship of the province of Syria, a consulship in May 95, and finally a priesthood, which he still held in 102</span>
				<span class='text'>Titus Flavius Norbanus may have been appointed to the prefecture of Egypt, but almost certainly became prefect of the Praetorian Guard by 94, with [[Titus Petronius Secundus]] as his colleague</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=jones-148&gt;Jones (1992), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>148–149&lt;/ref&gt; Domitian opened the year following the revolt by sharing the consulship with Marcus Cocceius Nerva, suggesting the latter had played a part in uncovering the conspiracy, perhaps in a fashion similar to the one he played during the Pisonian conspiracy under Nero</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=jones-160/&gt; Furthermore, contemporary historians such as [[Pliny the Younger]], Tacitus and Suetonius all wrote down the information on his reign after it had ended, and his memory had been condemned to oblivion</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jones (1992), p</span>
				<span class='text'>32&lt;/ref&gt;The most extensive account of the life of Domitian to survive was written by the historian Suetonius, who was born during the reign of Vespasian, and published his works under Emperor [[Hadrian]] (117–138)</span>
				<span class='text'>His ''[[De Vita Caesarum]]'' is the source of much of what is known of Domitian</span>

				<span class='text'>Other passages, alluding to Domitian's love of [[epigram]]matic expression, suggest that he was in fact familiar with classic writers, while he also patronized poets and architects, founded artistic Olympics, and personally restored the library of Rome at great expense after it had burned down</span>

				<span class='text'>tml#22 22]&lt;/ref&gt;Modern historians consider this highly implausible however, noting that malicious rumours such as those concerning Domitia's alleged infidelity were eagerly repeated by post-Domitianic authors, and used to highlight the hypocrisy of a ruler publicly preaching a return to Augustan morals, while privately indulging in excesses and presiding over a corrupt court</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Levick (2002), p</span>
				<span class='text'>211&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the account of Suetonius has dominated imperial historiography for centuries</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough Tacitus is usually considered to be the most reliable author of this era, his views on Domitian are complicated by the fact that his father-in-law, Gnaeus Julius Agricola, may have been a personal enemy of the Emperor</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=jones-58&gt;Jones (1992), p</span>
				<span class='text'>58&lt;/ref&gt; In his biographical work ''[[Agricola (book)|Agricola]]'', Tacitus maintains that Agricola was forced into retirement because his triumph over the Caledonians highlighted Domitian's own inadequacy as a military commander</span>
				<span class='text'>Several modern authors such as Dorey have argued the opposite: that Agricola was in fact a close friend of Domitian, and that Tacitus merely sought to distance his family from the fallen dynasty once Nerva was in power</span>

				<span class='text'>Juvenal savagely satirized the Domitianic court in his ''[[Satires of Juvenal|Satires]]'', depicting the Emperor and his entourage as corrupt, violent and unjust</span>
				<span class='text'>As a consequence, the anti-Domitianic tradition was already well established by the end of the 2nd century, and by the 3rd century, even expanded upon by early Church historians, who identified Domitian as an early persecutor of Christians, such as in the [[Acts of John]]</span>
