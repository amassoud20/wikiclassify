				<span class='text'>Instead he sought a middle ground, the [[pastoral]] realm that integrates both nature and culture</span>
				<span class='text'>His philosophy required that he be a didactic arbitration between the wilderness he based so much on and the spreading mass of North American humanity</span>

				<span class='text'>The wildness he enjoyed was the nearby swamp or forest, and he preferred &quot;partially cultivated country</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; His idea of being &quot;far in the recesses of the wilderness&quot; of Maine was to &quot;travel the logger's path and the Indian trail&quot;, but he also hiked on pristine untouched land</span>

				<span class='text'>But contact with real wilderness in Maine affected him far differently than had the idea of wilderness in Concord</span>

				<span class='text'>Although he was hopeful that mankind could potentially have, through self-betterment, the kind of government which &quot;governs not at all&quot;, he distanced himself from contemporary &quot;no-government men&quot; ([[anarchists]]), writing: &quot;I ask for, not at once no government, but at once a better government</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;resistance&quot; /&gt;Thoreau deemed the evolution from [[absolute monarchy]] to [[limited monarchy]] to [[democracy]] as &quot;a progress toward true respect for the individual&quot; and theorized about further improvements &quot;towards recognizing and organizing the rights of man</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;resistance&quot; /&gt;Although Thoreau believed resistance to unjustly exercised authority could be both violent (exemplified in his support for John Brown) and nonviolent (his own example of [[tax resistance]] displayed in ''Resistance to Civil Government''), he regarded [[Pacifism|pacifist]] [[nonresistance]] as temptation to passivity,&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;[http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt;Thoreau was [[ambivalent]] towards [[industrialization]] and [[capitalism]]</span>

				<span class='text'>The condition of the operatives is becoming every day more like that of the English; and it cannot be wondered at, since, as far as I have heard or observed, the principal object is, not that mankind may be well and honestly clad, but, unquestionably, that corporations may be enriched</span>

				<span class='text'>urthermore, in &quot;The Pond in Winter&quot;, he equates Walden Pond with the sacred [[Ganges in Hinduism|Ganges river]], writing:{{quote|In the morning I bathe my intellect in the stupendous and cosmogonal philosophy of the Bhagvat Geeta since whose composition years of the gods have elapsed, and in comparison with which our modern world and its literature seem puny and trivial; and I doubt if that philosophy is not to be referred to a previous state of existence, so remote is its sublimity from our conceptions</span>
				<span class='text'>I lay down the book and go to my well for water, and lo! there I meet the servant of the Brahmin, priest of Brahmaand Vishnu and Indra, who still sits in his temple on the Ganges reading the Vedas, or dwells at the root of a tree with his crust and water jug</span>

				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt;==Criticism==Although his writings would receive widespread acclaim, Thoreau's ideas were not universally applauded</span>
				<span class='text'>Scottish author [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] judged Thoreau's endorsement of living alone and apart from modern society in natural simplicity to be a mark of &quot;unmanly&quot; [[effeminacy]] and &quot;womanish solitude&quot;, while deeming him a self-indulgent &quot;skulker</span>

				<span class='text'>Cornhill Magazine</span>
				<span class='text'>June 1880</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] was also critical of Thoreau, writing that he &quot;repudiated all regular modes of getting a living, and seems inclined to lead a sort of Indian life among civilized men</span>

				<span class='text'>Hall, 1992</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In a similar vein, poet [[John Greenleaf Whittier]] detested what he deemed to be the &quot;wicked&quot; and &quot;heathenish&quot; message of ''Walden'', claiming that Thoreau wanted man to &quot;lower himself to the level of a [[woodchuck]] and walk on four legs</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In response to such criticisms, English novelist [[George Eliot]], writing for the ''[[Westminster Review]]'', characterized such critics as uninspired and narrow-minded:{{quote|People—very wise in their own eyes—who would have every man's life ordered according to a particular pattern, and who are intolerant of every existence the utility of which is not palpable to them, may pooh-pooh Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Thoreau and this episode in his history, as unpractical and dreamy</span>

				<span class='text'>6, No</span>
				<span class='text'>4 (Dec</span>
				<span class='text'> 1933), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>733–746&lt;/ref&gt;}}Thoreau himself also responded to the criticism in a paragraph of his work &quot;Walden&quot; (1854), by illustrating the irrelevance of their inquiries:{{quote|I should not obtrude my affairs so much on the notice of my readers if very particular inquiries had not been made by my townsmen concerning my mode of life, which some would call impertinent, though they do not appear to me at all impertinent, but, considering the circumstances, very natural and pertinent</span>
				<span class='text'>Some have asked what I got to eat; if I did not feel lonesome; if I was not afraid; and the like</span>
				<span class='text'>Others have been curious to learn what portion of my income I devoted to charitable purposes; and some, who have large families, how many poor children I maintained</span>
				<span class='text'>[</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> Unfortunately, I am confined to this theme by the narrowness of my experience</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, I, on my side, require of every writer, first or last, a simple and sincere account of his own life, and not merely what he has heard of other men's lives; [</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> I trust that none will stretch the seams in putting on the coat, for it may do good service to him whom it fits</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Thoreau ''Walden'' (1854)&lt;/ref&gt;}}Recent criticism has accused Thoreau of hypocrisy, misanthropy and being sanctimonious, based on his writings in [[Walden]],&lt;ref name=neworker1&gt;{{cite web |url=https://web</span>
