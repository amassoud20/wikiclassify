				<span class='text'>He is best known for his comics about [[Donald Duck]] and as the creator of [[Scrooge McDuck]]</span>
				<span class='text'> He worked anonymously until late in his career; fans dubbed him '''The Duck Man''' and '''The Good Duck Artist'''</span>

				<span class='text'>He had an older brother named Clyde</span>
				<span class='text'>Barks once stated that his paternal ancestors were Dutch and his maternal ancestors were Scottish</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=September 2012}} His paternal grandparents were David Barks and his wife Ruth Shrum</span>
				<span class='text'>His maternal grandparents were Carl Johnson and his wife Suzanna Massey, but little else is known about his ancestors</span>
				<span class='text'>Barks was the descendant of Jacob Barks who came to Missouri from North Carolina around 1800</span>
				<span class='text'>They lived in Marble Hill in Bollinger County</span>
				<span class='text'>Jacob Barks' son Isaac was the father of the David Barks noted above</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Source: 1850 census; ''Goodspeed's History of Southeast Missouri'', Southern Historical Press, 1888</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Childhood===According to Barks' description of his childhood, he was a rather lonely child</span>
				<span class='text'>His parents owned one square mile (2</span>
				<span class='text'>&amp;nbsp;km²) of land that served as their farm</span>
				<span class='text'>The nearest neighbor lived half a mile (800 m) away, but he was more an acquaintance to Barks' parents than a friend</span>
				<span class='text'>The closest school was about two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) away and Barks had to walk that distance every day</span>
				<span class='text'>The rural area had few children, though, and Barks later remembered that his school had only about eight or ten students including him</span>
				<span class='text'>He had high praise for the quality of the education he received in that small school</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Schools were good in those days,&quot; he used to say</span>
				<span class='text'>he lessons lasted from nine o'clock in the morning to four o'clock in the afternoon and then he had to return to the farm</span>
				<span class='text'>There he remembered not having anybody to talk to, as his parents were busy and he had little in common with his brother</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1908, William Barks (in an attempt to increase the family income) moved with his family to [[Midland, Oregon|Midland]], Oregon, some miles north of Merrill, to be closer to the new railway lines</span>
				<span class='text'>He established a new stock-breeding farm and sold his produce to the local slaughterhouses</span>
				<span class='text'>ine-year-old Clyde and seven-year-old Carl worked long hours there</span>
				<span class='text'>But Carl later remembered that the crowd which gathered at Midland's market place made a strong impression on him</span>
				<span class='text'>This was expected, as he was not used to crowds up until then</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Barks, his attention was mostly drawn to the [[cowboy]]s that frequented the market with their revolvers, strange nicknames for each other and sense of humor</span>
				<span class='text'>y 1911, they had been successful enough to move to [[Santa Rosa, California|Santa Rosa]], [[California]]</span>
				<span class='text'>There they started cultivating vegetables and set up some orchards</span>
				<span class='text'>Unfortunately, the profits were not as high as William expected and they started having financial difficulties</span>
				<span class='text'>William's anxiety over them was probably what caused his first nervous breakdown</span>
				<span class='text'>s soon as William recovered, he made the decision to move back to Merrill</span>
				<span class='text'>The year was 1913, and Barks was already 12 years old; but, due to the constant moving, he had not yet managed to complete grade school</span>
				<span class='text'>He resumed his education at this point and finally managed to graduate in 1916</span>
				<span class='text'>916 served as a turning point in Barks' life for various reasons</span>
				<span class='text'>First, Arminta, his mother, died in this year</span>
				<span class='text'>Second, his hearing problems, which had already appeared earlier, had at the time become severe enough for him to have difficulties listening to his teachers talking</span>
				<span class='text'>His hearing would continue to get worse later, but at that point he had not yet acquired a hearing aid</span>
				<span class='text'>Later in life, he couldn't do without one</span>
				<span class='text'>Third, the closest high school to their farm was five miles (8&amp;nbsp;km) away and even if he did enroll in it, his bad hearing was likely to contribute to his learning problems</span>
				<span class='text'>He had to decide to stop his school education, much to his disappointment</span>
				<span class='text'>==From job to job===Barks started taking various jobs but had little success in such occupations as a farmer, woodcutter, turner, mule driver, cowboy and printer</span>
				<span class='text'>From his jobs he learned, he later averred, how eccentric, stubborn and unpredictable men, animals and machines can be</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time he interacted with colleagues, fellow breadwinners who had satirical disposition towards even their worst troubles</span>
				<span class='text'>Barks later declared that he was sure that if not for a little humor in their troubled lives, they would certainly go insane</span>
				<span class='text'>It was an attitude towards life that Barks would adopt</span>
				<span class='text'>Later he would say it was natural for him to satirize the secret yearnings and desires, the pompous style and the disappointments of his characters</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Barks, this period of his life would later influence his best known fictional characters: [[Walt Disney]]'s [[Donald Duck]] and his own [[Scrooge McDuck]]</span>
				<span class='text'>onald's drifting from job to job was reportedly inspired by Barks' own experiences</span>
				<span class='text'>So was his usual lack of success</span>
				<span class='text'>And even in those that he was successful this would be temporary, just until a mistake or chance event caused another failure, another disappointment for the frustrated duck</span>
				<span class='text'>Barks also reported that this was another thing he was familiar with</span>
				<span class='text'>crooge's main difference to Donald, according to Barks, was that he too had faced the same difficulties in his past but through intelligence, determination and hard work, he was able to overcome them</span>
				<span class='text'>Or, as Scrooge himself would say to [[Huey, Dewey and Louie]]: by being &quot;tougher than the toughies and smarter than the smarties</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Even in the present of his stories Scrooge would work to solve his many problems, even though the stories would often point out that his constant efforts seemed futile at the end</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, Scrooge was quite similar to his creator in appearing often to be as melancholic, introspective and secretive as he was</span>
				<span class='text'>hrough both characters Barks would often exhibit his rather sarcastic sense of humor</span>
				<span class='text'>It seems that this difficult period for the artist helped shape many of his later views in life that were expressed through his characters</span>
				<span class='text'>==Professional artist===At the same time Barks had started thinking about turning a hobby that he always enjoyed into a profession: that of drawing</span>
				<span class='text'>Since his early childhood he spent his free time by drawing on any material he could find</span>
				<span class='text'>He had attempted to improve his style by copying the drawings of his favorite [[comic strip]] artists from the newspapers where he could find them</span>
				<span class='text'>As he later said, he wanted to create his own facial expressions, figures and comical situations in his drawings but wanted to study the master comic artists' use of the pen and their use of color and shading</span>
				<span class='text'>mong his early favorites were [[Winsor McCay]] (mostly known for ''[[Little Nemo]]'') and [[Frederick Burr Opper]] (mostly known for ''[[Happy Hooligan]]'') but he would later study any style that managed to draw his attention</span>
				<span class='text'>t 16 he was mostly self-taught but at this point he decided to take some lessons through correspondence</span>
				<span class='text'>He only followed the first four lessons and then had to stop because his working left him with little free time</span>
				<span class='text'>But as he later said, the lessons proved very useful in improving his style</span>
				<span class='text'>y December 1918, he left his father's home to attempt to find a job in [[San Francisco]], California</span>
				<span class='text'>He worked for a while in a small publishing house while attempting to sell his drawings to newspapers and other printed material with little success</span>
				<span class='text'>==First and second marriages===While he continued drifting through various jobs, he met Pearl Turner (1904–1987)</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1921 they married and had two daughters:* Peggy Barks, born in 1923 and deceased in 1963</span>
				<span class='text'> Dorothy Barks, born in 1924</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1923 he returned to his paternal farm in Merrill in an attempt to return to the life of a farmer, but that ended soon</span>
				<span class='text'>He continued searching for a job while attempting to sell his drawings</span>
				<span class='text'>He soon managed to sell some of them to ''Judge'' magazine and then started having success submitting to the Minneapolis-based ''Calgary-Eye-Opener'', a racy men's cartoon magazine of the era</span>
				<span class='text'>He was eventually hired as editor and scripted and drew most of the contents while continuing to sell occasional work to other magazines</span>
				<span class='text'>His salary of 90 dollars a month was considered respectable enough for the time</span>
				<span class='text'>A facsimile of one of the racy magazines he did cartoons for in this period, ''Coo Coo'' #1, was published by Hamilton Comics in 1997</span>
				<span class='text'>eanwhile, he had his first divorce</span>
				<span class='text'>He and Pearl were separated in 1929 and divorced in 1930</span>
				<span class='text'>After he moved to [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], where ''Calgary-Eye-Opener'' had its offices he met Clara Balken who in 1938 became his second wife</span>
				<span class='text'>==Disney===In November 1935, when he learned that Walt Disney was seeking more artists for his studio, Barks decided to apply</span>
				<span class='text'>He was approved for a try-out which entailed a move to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was one of two in his class of trainees who was hired</span>
				<span class='text'>His starting salary was 20 dollars a week</span>
				<span class='text'>He started at Disney Studios in 1935, more than a year after the debut of Donald Duck on June 9, 1934 in the short animated film ''[[The Wise Little Hen]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>arks initially worked as an [[animator#Inbetweeners and cleanup artists|inbetweener]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This involved being teamed and supervised by one of the head animators who did the key poses of character action (often known as extremes) for which the inbetweeners did the drawings between the extremes to create the illusion of movement</span>
				<span class='text'>While an inbetweener, Barks submitted gag ideas for cartoon story lines being developed and showed such a knack for creating comical situations that by 1937 he was transferred to the story department</span>
				<span class='text'>His first story sale was the climax of [[Modern Inventions]], for a sequence where a robot barber chair gives Donald Duck a haircut on his bottom</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1937 when Donald Duck became the star of his own series of cartoons instead of co-starring with [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Goofy]] as previously, a new unit of storymen and animators was created devoted solely to this series</span>
				<span class='text'>Though he originally just contributed gag ideas to some duck cartoons by 1937 Barks was (principally with partner [[Jack Hannah]]) originating story ideas that were storyboarded and (if approved by Walt) put into production</span>
				<span class='text'>He collaborated on such cartoons as ''[[Donald's Nephews]]'' (1938), ''[[Donald's Cousin Gus]]'' (1939), ''[[Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Duck Steps Out]]'' (1940),''[[Timber (film)|Timber]]'' (1941), ''[[The Vanishing Private]]'' (1942) and ''[[The Plastics Inventor]]'' (1944)</span>
				<span class='text'>==The Good Duck Artist===[[File:Omelet</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Omelet opening page]]Unhappy at the emerging wartime working conditions at Disney, and bothered by ongoing sinus problems caused by the studio's air conditioning, Barks quit in 1942</span>
				<span class='text'>Shortly before quitting, he moonlighted as a comic book artist, contributing half the artwork for a one-shot [[comic book]] (the other half of the art being done by story partner [[Jack Hannah]]) titled ''[[Donald Duck Finds Pirate Gold]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>This 64-page story was adapted by Donald Duck comic strip writer [[Bob Karp]] from an unproduced feature, and published in October 1942 in [[Dell Comics]] ''[[Four Color|Four Color Comics]]'' #9</span>
				<span class='text'>It was the first Donald Duck story originally produced for an American comic book and also the first involving Donald and his nephews in a treasure hunting expedition, in this case for the treasure of [[Henry Morgan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Barks would later use the treasure hunting theme in many of his stories</span>
				<span class='text'>This actually was not his first work in comics, as earlier the same year Barks along with Hannah and fellow storyman Nick George scripted ''[[Pluto Saves the Ship]]'', which was among the first original Disney comic book stories published in the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>fter quitting the Disney Studio, Barks relocated to the [[Hemet, California|Hemet]]/[[San Jacinto, California|San Jacinto]] area in the semi-desert [[Inland Empire (California)|inland empire]] region east of Los Angeles where he hoped to start a chicken farm</span>
				<span class='text'>hen asked which of his stories was a favorite in several interviews Barks cited the ten-pager in ''Walt Disney's Comics and Stories'' #146 (Nov</span>
				<span class='text'>1952) in which Donald tells the story of the chain of unfortunate events that took place when he owned a chicken farm in a town which subsequently was renamed Omelet</span>
				<span class='text'>Likely one reason it was a favorite is that it was inspired by Barks' own experiences in the poultry business</span>
				<span class='text'>ut to earn a living in the meantime he inquired whether [[Western Publishing]], which had published ''Pirate Gold'', had any need for artists for Donald Duck comic book stories</span>
				<span class='text'>He was immediately assigned to illustrate the script for a ten-page Donald Duck story for the monthly ''[[Walt Disney's Comics and Stories]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>At the publisher's invitation he revised the storyline and the improvements impressed the editor sufficiently to invite Barks to try his hand at contributing both the script and the artwork of his follow-up story</span>
				<span class='text'>This set the pattern for Barks' career in that (with rare exceptions) he provided art (pencil, inking, solid blacks and lettering) and scripting for his stories</span>
				<span class='text'>'[[The Victory Garden (comic book)|The Victory Garden]]'', that initial ten-page story published in April, 1943 was the first of about 500 stories featuring the Disney ducks Barks would produce for Western Publishing over the next three decades, well into his purported retirement</span>
				<span class='text'>These can be mostly divided into three categories:* One-page gag stories like &quot;[[Coffee for Two]]&quot; and &quot;[[Sorry to be Safe]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>These one-pagers were usually printed in black and white (or black and white and red) on the inside front, inside back, and outside back covers</span>
				<span class='text'>These stories focused on one joke</span>
				<span class='text'>* Ten-pagers, comedic Donald Duck stories that were the lead for the monthly flagship title ''Walt Disney's Comics and Stories'', whose circulation peaked in the mid-1950s at 3 million copies sold a month</span>
				<span class='text'> Humorous adventure stories, usually 24-32 pages in length</span>
				<span class='text'>In the 1940s these were one-shots in the ''Four Color'' series (issued 4–6 times a year) that starred Donald and his nephews</span>
				<span class='text'>Starting in the early 1950s (and through his retirement) Barks' longer stories were almost exclusively published in Uncle Scrooge's own quarterly title</span>
				<span class='text'>arks' artistic growth during his first decade in comics saw a transformation from rather rudimentary storytelling derived from his years as an animation artist and storyman into a virtuoso creator of complex narratives, notably in his longer adventure tales</span>
				<span class='text'>According to critic Geoffrey Blum, the process that saw its beginnings in 1942's Pirate Gold first bore its full fruit in 1950's '[[Vacation Time]],' which he describes as 'a visual primer for reading comics and understanding</span>

				<span class='text'>1990|issue=18|pages=[46]}}&lt;/ref&gt;He surrounded [[Donald Duck]] and nephews [[Huey, Dewey and Louie]] with a cast of eccentric and colorful characters, such as the aforementioned [[Scrooge McDuck]], the wealthiest [[duck]] in the world; [[Gladstone Gander]], Donald's obscenely lucky cousin; inventor [[Gyro Gearloose]]; the persistent [[Beagle Boys]]; the sorceress [[Magica De Spell]]; Scrooge's rivals [[Flintheart Glomgold]] and [[John D</span>
				<span class='text'>Rockerduck]]; Daisy's nieces [[April, May and June]]; Donald's neighbor Jones, and [[The Junior Woodchucks]] organization</span>
				<span class='text'>arks's stories (whether humorous adventures or domestic comedies) often exhibited a wry, dark irony born of hard experience</span>
				<span class='text'>The ten-pagers showcased Donald as everyman, struggling against the cruel bumps and bruises of everyday life with the nephews often acting as a [[Greek chorus]] commenting on the unfolding disasters Donald wrought upon himself</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet while seemingly defeatist in tone, the humanity of the characters shines through in their persistence despite the obstacles</span>
				<span class='text'>These stories found popularity not only among young children but adults as well</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite the fact that Barks had done little traveling his adventure stories often had the duck clan globe-trotting to the most remote or spectacular of places</span>
				<span class='text'>This allowed Barks to indulge his penchant for elaborate backgrounds that hinted at his thwarted ambitions of doing realistic stories in the vein of [[Hal Foster]]'s ''[[Prince Valiant]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>==Third marriage===As Barks blossomed creatively, his marriage to Clara deteriorated</span>
				<span class='text'>This is the period referred to in Barks' famed quip that he could feel his creative juices flowing while the whiskey bottles hurled at him by a tipsy Clara flew by his head</span>
				<span class='text'>They were divorced in 1951, his second and last divorce</span>
				<span class='text'>In this period Barks dabbled in fine art, exhibiting paintings at local art shows</span>
				<span class='text'>It was at one of these in 1952 he became acquainted with fellow exhibitor Margaret Wynnfred Williams (1917 – March 10, 1993), nicknamed Garé</span>
				<span class='text'>She was an accomplished landscape artist, some of whose paintings are in the collection of the [[Leanin' Tree Museum of Western Art]]</span>
				<span class='text'>During her lifetime, and to this day, note cards of her paintings are available from Leanin' Tree</span>
				<span class='text'>Her nickname appears as a store name in the story &quot;Christmas in Duckburg&quot;, featured on page 1 of Walt Disney’s Christmas Parade #9, published in 1958</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon after they met, she started assisting Barks, handling the solid blacks and lettering, both of which he had found onerous</span>
				<span class='text'>They married in 1954 and the union lasted until her death</span>
				<span class='text'>==No longer anonymous===People who worked for Disney (and its comic book licensees) generally did so in relative anonymity; stories would only carry Walt Disney's name and (sometimes) a short identification number</span>
				<span class='text'>Prior to 1960 Barks' identity remained a mystery to his readers</span>
				<span class='text'>However, many readers recognized Barks' work and drawing style—he &quot;signed&quot; many stories with a small image of a barking dog—and began to call him the Good Duck Artist, a label that stuck even after his true identity was discovered by fans in the late 1950s</span>
				<span class='text'>Malcolm Willits was the first person to learn Barks's name and address, but two brothers named John and [[Bill Spicer]] became the first fans to contact Barks after independently discovering the same information</span>
				<span class='text'>After Barks received a 1960 visit from the Spicer brothers and Ron Leonard, he was no longer anonymous, as word of his identity spread through the emerging network of comic book fandom [[fanzine]]s and [[Fan convention|conventions]]</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|Carl Barks visiting [[Finland]] in June, 1994</span>
				<span class='text'>thumb]]Carl Barks retired in 1966, but was persuaded by editor [[Chase Craig]] to continue to script stories for Western</span>
				<span class='text'>The last new comic book story drawn by Carl Barks was a [[Daisy Duck]] tale (&quot;The Dainty Daredevil&quot;) published in ''[[Walt Disney Comics Digest]]'' issue 5 (Nov</span>
				<span class='text'>1968)</span>

				<span class='text'>The latter included environmental themes that Barks first explored in 1957 [&quot;Land of the Pygmy Indians&quot;, Uncle Scrooge #18]</span>
				<span class='text'>Barks also sold a few sketches to Western that were redrawn as covers</span>
				<span class='text'>For a time the Barkses lived in [[Goleta, California]] before returning to the Inland Empire by moving to [[Temecula, California|Temecula]]</span>
				<span class='text'>o make a little extra money beyond what his pension and scripting earnings brought in, Barks started doing oil paintings to sell at the local art shows where he and Garé exhibited</span>

				<span class='text'>This prompted Barks to contact [[George Sherman (comics)|George Sherman]] at Disney's Publications Department to request permission to produce and sell oil paintings of scenes from his stories</span>

				<span class='text'>By September 1974 Barks had discontinued taking commissions</span>

				<span class='text'>pg&lt;/ref&gt;At Boston's NewCon convention, in October 1975, the first Carl Barks oil painting auctioned at a comic book convention (&quot;She Was Spangled and Flashy&quot;) sold for $2,500</span>
				<span class='text'>Subsequent offerings saw an escalation in the prices realized</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1976, Barks and Garé went to Boston for the NewCon show, their first comic convention appearance</span>
				<span class='text'>Among the other attendees was famed [[Little Lulu]] comic book scripter [[John Stanley (comics)|John Stanley]]; despite both having worked for [[Western Publishing]] this was the first time they met</span>
				<span class='text'>The highlight of the convention was the auctioning of what was to that time the largest duck oil painting Barks had done, &quot;July Fourth in Duckburg&quot;, which included depictions of several prominent Barks fans and collectors</span>
				<span class='text'>It sold for a then record high amount: $6,400</span>
				<span class='text'>oon thereafter a fan sold unauthorized prints of some of the Scrooge McDuck paintings, leading Disney to withdraw permission for further paintings</span>
				<span class='text'>To meet demand for new work Barks embarked on a series of paintings of non-Disney ducks and fantasy subjects such as Beowulf and Xerxes</span>
				<span class='text'>These were eventually collected in the limited-edition book ''Animal Quackers''</span>
				<span class='text'>s the result of heroic efforts by ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' producer [[Gary Kurtz]] and screenwriter [[Edward Summer]], Disney relented and in 1981, allowed Barks to do a now seminal oil painting called &quot;Wanderers of Wonderlands&quot; for a breakthrough limited edition book entitled ''[[Uncle Scrooge McDuck: His Life and Times]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The book collected 11 classic Barks stories of Uncle Scrooge colored by artist [[Peter Ledger]] along with a new Scrooge story by Barks done storybook style with watercolor illustrations, &quot;Go Slowly, Sands of Time&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>After being turned down by every major publisher in New York City, Kurtz and Summer published the book through [[Celestial Arts]], which Kurtz acquired partly for this purpose</span>
				<span class='text'>The book went on to become the model for virtually every important collection of comic book stories</span>
				<span class='text'>It was the first book of its kind ever reviewed in ''[[Time Magazine]] ''and subsequently in ''[[Newsweek]]'', and the first book review in ''Time Magazine'' with large color illustrations</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1977 and 1982, Barks attended the San Diego Comic Con</span>
				<span class='text'>As with his appearance in Boston, the response to his presence was overwhelming, with long lines of fans waiting to meet Barks and get his autograph</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1981, Bruce Hamilton and Russ Cochran, two long-time Disney comics fans, decided to combine forces to bring greater recognition to the works of Carl Barks</span>
				<span class='text'>Their first efforts went into establishing [[Another Rainbow]] Publishing, the banner under which they produced and issued the award-winning book, &quot;The Fine Art of Walt Disney´s Donald Duck by Carl Barks&quot;, a comprehensive collection of the Disney duck paintings of this artist and storyteller</span>
				<span class='text'>Not long after, the company began producing fine art lithographs of many of these paintings, in strictly limited editions, all signed by Barks, who eventually produced many original works for the series</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1983 Another Rainbow took up the daunting task of collecting the entire Disney comic book ouvré of Barks—over 500 stories in all—in the ten-set, thirty-volume ''[[Carl Barks Library]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>These oversized hardbound volumes reproduced Barks´ pages in pristine black and white line art, as close as possible to the way he would originally drawn them, and included mountains of special features, articles, reminiscences, interviews, storyboards, critiques, and more than a few surprises</span>
				<span class='text'>This monumental project was finally completed in mid-1990</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1985 a new division was founded, [[Gladstone Publishing]], which took up the then-dormant Disney comic book license</span>
				<span class='text'>Gladstone introduced a whole new generation of Disney comic book readers to the wondrous storytelling of such luminaries as Barks, Paul Murry, and Floyd Gottfredson, as well as presenting the first works of modern Disney comics masters Don Rosa and William Van Horn</span>
				<span class='text'>Seven years after Gladstone's founding, the ''Carl Barks Library'' was revived as the ''Carl Barks Library in Color'', a full-color, high-quality squarebound comic albums (including the first-ever Carl Barks trading cards)</span>
				<span class='text'>arks relocated one last time to Grants Pass, Oregon near where he grew up, partly at the urging of friend and ''[[Broom Hilda]]'' artist [[Russell Myers]], who lived in the area</span>
				<span class='text'>The move also was motivated, Barks stated in another famous quip, by Temecula being too close to Disneyland and thus facilitating a growing torrent of drop-in visits by vacationing fans</span>
				<span class='text'>In this period Barks made only one public appearance, at a comic book shop near Grants Pass</span>
				<span class='text'>rom 1993 to 1998, Barks' career was managed by the &quot;Carl Barks Studio&quot; (Bill Grandey and Kathy Morby—They had sold Barks original art since 1979)</span>
				<span class='text'>This involved numerous art projects and activities, including a tour of 11 European countries in 1994, Iceland being the first foreign country he ever visited</span>
				<span class='text'>Barks appeared at the first of many Disneyana conventions in 1993</span>
				<span class='text'>Silk screen prints of paintings along with high-end art objects (such as original water colors, bronze figurines and ceramic tiles) were produced based on designs by Barks</span>
				<span class='text'>uring the summer of 1994 and until his death, Carl Barks &amp; his studio personally assigned Peter Reichelt, a museum exhibition producer from [[Mannheim]], Germany, as his agent for Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>Publisher &quot;Edition 313&quot; put out numerous lithographs</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1997, tensions between Barks and the Studio eventually resulted in a lawsuit that was settled with an agreement that included the disbanding of the Studio</span>
				<span class='text'>Barks never traveled to make another Disney appearance</span>
				<span class='text'>He was represented by Rev</span>
				<span class='text'>Ed Bergen, as he completed a final project</span>
				<span class='text'>Gerry Tank and Jim Mitchell were to assist Barks in his final years</span>
				<span class='text'>uring his Carl Barks Studio years, Barks created two more stories: the script for the final Uncle Scrooge story &quot;Horsing Around with History&quot;, which was first published in Denmark in 1994 with Bill Van Horn art</span>
				<span class='text'>The Barks outlines for Barks final Donald Duck story &quot;Somewhere in Nowhere&quot;, were first published in 1997, in Italy, with art by Pat Block</span>
				<span class='text'>ustrian artist [[Gottfried Helnwein]] curated and organized the first solo museum-exhibition of Carl Barks</span>
				<span class='text'>Between 1994 and 1998 the retrospective was shown in ten European museums and seen by more than 400,000 visitors</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>I used a #356 Esterbrook art and drafting pen which could do everything from thin 'fadeaways' to broad accented curve sweeps on foreground circles such as the ducks' forms</span>
				<span class='text'>The trick of breaking in a new pen, I discovered, is to soak it for several minutes in the ink bottle</span>
				<span class='text'>Then wipe off the ink and the pen's varnish</span>
				<span class='text'>For some weird reason most new pens then start out flexible and free-flowing&amp;nbsp;</span>
