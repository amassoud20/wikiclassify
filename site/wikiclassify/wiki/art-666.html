				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Mack was casting his play ''[[The Noose (play)|The Noose]]'' and LaHiff suggested that the part of the chorus girl be played by a real chorus girl</span>

				<span class='text'>quot; In [[Arthur Hopkins]]' autobiography, ''To a Lonely Boy,'' he describes how he came about casting Stanwyck, saying: &quot;After some search for the girl, I interviewed a nightclub dancer who had just scored in a small emotional part in a play that did not run (''The Noose'')</span>
				<span class='text'>She seemed to have the quality I wanted, a sort of rough poignancy</span>
				<span class='text'>She at once displayed more sensitive, easily expressed emotion than I had encountered since [[Pauline Lord]]</span>

				<span class='text'>I had great plans for her, but the Hollywood offers kept coming</span>
				<span class='text'>There was no competing with them</span>
				<span class='text'>She became a picture star</span>
				<span class='text'>She is Barbara Stanwyck</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He also describes Stanwyck as &quot;The greatest natural actress of our time,&quot; noting with sadness, &quot;One of the theater's great potential actresses was embalmed in celluloid</span>
