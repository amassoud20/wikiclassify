				<span class='text'> 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The Emperor quickly chose to send Cyril, accompanied by his brother Methodius</span>
				<span class='text'>The request provided a convenient opportunity to expand Byzantine influence</span>
				<span class='text'>Their first work seems to have been the training of assistants</span>
				<span class='text'>In 863, they began the task of translating the [[Bible]] into the language now known as [[Old Church Slavonic]] and travelled to Great Moravia to promote it</span>
				<span class='text'>They enjoyed considerable success in this endeavour</span>
				<span class='text'>However, they came into conflict with German ecclesiastics who opposed their efforts to create a specifically Slavic liturgy</span>
				<span class='text'>or the purpose of this mission, they devised the [[Glagolitic alphabet|Glagolitic]] [[alphabet]], the first alphabet to be used for Slavonic manuscripts</span>
				<span class='text'>The Glagolitic alphabet was suited to match the specific features of the Slavic language</span>
				<span class='text'>Its descendant script, the Cyrillic, is still used by many languages today</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brit/&gt;They wrote the first Slavic [[Civil Code]], which was used in Great Moravia</span>
				<span class='text'>The language derived from Old Church Slavonic, known as [[Church Slavonic]], is still used in [[liturgy]] by several [[Orthodox Church]]es and also in some [[Eastern Catholic]] churches</span>
				<span class='text'>t is impossible to determine with certainty what portions of the Bible the brothers translated</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[New Testament]] and the [[Psalms]] seem to have been the first, followed by other lessons from the [[Old Testament]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''&quot;Translatio&quot;'' speaks only of a version of the [[Gospels]] by Cyril, and the ''&quot;Vita Methodii&quot;'' only of the ''&quot;evangelium Slovenicum,&quot;'' though other liturgical selections may also have been translated</span>
				<span class='text'>or is it known for sure which liturgy, that of Rome or that of Constantinople, they took as a source</span>
				<span class='text'>They may well have used the [[Latin alphabet|Roman alphabet]], as suggested by liturgical fragments which adhere closely to the Latin type</span>
				<span class='text'>This view is confirmed by the &quot;Prague Fragments&quot; and by certain Old [[Glagolitic]] liturgical fragments brought from [[Jerusalem]] to [[Kiev]] and discovered there by Saresnewsky—probably the oldest document for the Slavonic tongue; these adhere closely to the Latin type, as is shown by the words ''&quot;Mass,&quot;'' ''&quot;Preface,&quot;'' and the name of one Felicitas</span>
				<span class='text'>In any case, the circumstances were such that the brothers could hope for no permanent success without obtaining the authorization of Rome</span>

				<span class='text'>Fresco in San Clemente]]In 867, [[Pope Nicholas I]] invited the brothers to Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>Their evangelizing mission in Moravia had by this time become the focus of a dispute with [[Dietmar I, Archbishop of Salzburg|Theotmar]], the [[Archbishop of Salzburg]] and [[bishop of Passau]], who claimed ecclesiastical control of the same territory and wished to see it use the Latin liturgy exclusively</span>
				<span class='text'>Travelling with the relics of [[Pope Clement I|Saint Clement]] and a retinue of disciples, and passing through [[Pannonia]] (the [[Balaton Principality]]), where they were well received by Prince [[Koceľ]] (Kocelj, Kozel), they arrived in Rome in 868, where they were warmly received</span>
				<span class='text'>This was partly due to their bringing with them the relics of Saint Clement; the rivalry with Constantinople as to the jurisdiction over the territory of the Slavs would incline Rome to value the brothers and their influence</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brit/&gt;The brothers were praised for their learning and cultivated for their influence in Constantinople</span>

				<span class='text'>There is some question as to assertion of the ''Translatio'' (ix</span>
				<span class='text'> that he was made a bishop</span>
				<span class='text'>==Methodius alone===Methodius now continued the work among the Slavs alone; not at first in Great Moravia, but in Pannonia (in the [[Balaton Principality]]), owing to the political circumstances of the former country, where Rastislav had been taken captive by his nephew [[Svatopluk I|Svatopluk]], then delivered over to Carloman, and condemned in a [[Reichstag (Holy Roman Empire)|diet]] of the empire at the end of 870</span>
				<span class='text'>riendly relations had been established with Koceľ on the journey to Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>This activity in Pannonia made a conflict inevitable with the German episcopate, and especially with the bishop of [[Salzburg]], to whose jurisdiction Pannonia had belonged for seventy-five years</span>
				<span class='text'>In 865 Bishop Adalwin is found exercising all Episcopal rights there, and the administration under him was in the hands of the archpriest Riehbald</span>
				<span class='text'>The latter was obliged to retire to Salzburg, but his superior was naturally disinclined to abandon his claims</span>
				<span class='text'>Methodius sought support from Rome; the ''Vita'' asserts that Koceľ sent him thither with an honorable escort to receive Episcopal consecration</span>
				<span class='text'>he letter given as Adrian's in chap</span>
				<span class='text'>viii</span>
				<span class='text'> with its approval of the Slavonic mass, is a pure invention</span>
				<span class='text'>The pope named Methodius archbishop of Sirmium with jurisdiction over Great Moravia and Pannonia, thus superseding the claims of Salzburg by an older title</span>
				<span class='text'>The statement of the ''&quot;Vita&quot;'' that Methodius was made bishop in 870 and not raised to the dignity of an archbishop until 873 is contradicted by the brief of [[Pope John VIII]], written in June 879, according to which Adrian consecrated him archbishop; John includes in his jurisdiction not only Great Moravia and Pannonia, but Serbia as well</span>
				<span class='text'>==Methodius' final years==={{Unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}The archiepiscopal claims of Methodius were considered such an injury to the rights of Salzburg that he was forced to answer for them at a synod held at [[Regensburg]] in the presence of King Louis</span>
				<span class='text'>The assembly, after a heated discussion, declared the deposition of the intruder, and ordered him to be sent to Germany, where he was kept prisoner in [[Ellwangen]] for two and a half years</span>
				<span class='text'>In spite of the strong representations of the ''[[Conversio Bagoariorum et Carantanorum]]'', written in 871 to influence the pope, though not avowing this purpose, Rome declared emphatically for Methodius, and sent a bishop, Paul of Ancons, to reinstate him and punish his enemies, after which both parties were commanded to appear in Rome with the legate</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Stanislav Dospavski - Saints Cyril and Methodius</span>
				<span class='text'>ng|thumb|upright|[[Saint]] Cyril and Methodius by [[Stanislav Dospevski]], [[Bulgaria]]n painter]]The papal will prevailed, and Methodius secured his freedom and his archiepiscopal authority over both Great Moravia and Pannonia, though the use of Slavonic for the mass was still denied to him</span>
				<span class='text'>His authority was restricted in Pannonia when after Koceľ's death the principality was administered by German nobles; but [[Svatopluk I|Svatopluk]] now ruled with practical independence in Great Moravia, and expelled the German clergy</span>
				<span class='text'>This apparently secured an undisturbed field of operation for Methodius, and the ''Vita'' (x</span>
				<span class='text'> depicts the next few years (873–879) as a period of fruitful progress</span>
				<span class='text'>Methodius seems to have disregarded, wholly or in part, the prohibition of the Slavonic liturgy; and when [[Franks|Frankish]] clerics again found their way into the country, and the archbishop's strictness had displeased the licentious Svatopluk, this was made a cause of complaint against him at Rome, coupled with charges regarding the ''[[Filioque clause|Filioque]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>ethodius vindicated his orthodoxy at Rome, the more easily as the creed was still recited there without the ''Filioque'', and promised to obey in regard to the liturgy</span>
				<span class='text'>The other party was conciliated by giving him a [[Swabia]]n, {{Not a typo|Wiching}}, as his coadjutor</span>
				<span class='text'>When relations were strained between the two, John VIII steadfastly supported Methodius; but after his death (December 882) the archbishop's position became insecure, and his need of support induced Goetz to accept the statement of the ''Vita'' (xiii</span>
				<span class='text'> that he went to visit the Eastern emperor</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|left|thumb|The [[Baška tablet]] is an early example of the Glagolitic from [[Croatia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>]The Glagolitic and Cyrillic alphabets are the oldest known Slavic [[alphabet]]s, and were created by the two brothers and their students, to translate the [[Bible]] and other texts into the [[Slavic languages]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=BritGlago&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Major alphabets of the world, Cyrillic and Glagolitic alphabets'', 2008, O</span>
				<span class='text'>d</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;The two early Slavic alphabets, the Cyrillic and the Glagolitic, were invented by St</span>
				<span class='text'>Cyril, or Constantine (c</span>
				<span class='text'>827–869), and St</span>
				<span class='text'>Methodius (c</span>
				<span class='text'>825–884)</span>
				<span class='text'>These men were Greeks from Thessalonica who became apostles to the southern Slavs, whom they converted to Christianity</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The early Glagolitic alphabet was used in Great Moravia between 863 (the arrival of Cyril and Methodius) and 885 (the expulsion of their students) for government and religious documents and books, and at the Great Moravian Academy (''Veľkomoravské učilište'') founded by Cyril, where followers of Cyril and Methodius were educated, by Methodius himself among others</span>
				<span class='text'>The alphabet has been traditionally attributed to Cyril</span>
				<span class='text'>That attribution has been confirmed explicitly by the papal letter ''Industriae tuae'' (880) approving the use of Old Church Slavonic, which says that the alphabet was &quot;invented by Constantine the Philosopher&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The term invention need not exclude the possibility of the brothers having made use of earlier letters, but implies only that before that time the Slavic languages had no distinct script of their own</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; as a simplification of the Glagolitic alphabet which more closely resembled the [[Greek language|Greek]] alphabet</span>
				<span class='text'>It was developed  by the disciples of Saints Cyril and Methodius at the [[Preslav Literary School]] at the end of the 9th century</span>
				<span class='text'>fter the death of Cyril, [[Clement of Ohrid]] accompanied Methodius from Rome to Pannonia and Great Moravia</span>
				<span class='text'>After the death of Methodius in 885, Clement headed the struggle against the German clergy in Great Moravia along with Gorazd</span>
				<span class='text'>After spending some time in jail, he was expelled from Great Moravia, and in 885 or 886 reached the borders of the Bulgarian Empire together with [[Saint Naum|Naum]] of [[Preslav]], Angelarius, and possibly Gorazd (according to other sources, Gorazd was already dead by that time)</span>
				<span class='text'>The four of them were afterwards sent to the Bulgarian capital of [[Pliska]], where they were commissioned by Tsar [[Boris I]] of Bulgaria to instruct the future clergy of the state in the Slavonic language</span>
				<span class='text'>fter the adoption of Christianity in 865, religious ceremonies in Bulgaria were conducted in Greek by clergy sent from the Byzantine Empire</span>
				<span class='text'>Fearing growing Byzantine influence and weakening of the state, Boris viewed the adoption of the Old Slavonic language as a way to preserve the political independence and stability of Bulgaria, so he established two literary schools (academies), in Pliska and [[Ohrid]], where theology was to be taught in the Slavonic language</span>
				<span class='text'>While [[Naum of Preslav]] stayed in Pliska working on the foundation of the [[Pliska Literary School]], Clement was commissioned by Boris I to organise the teaching of theology to future clergymen in Old Church Slavonic at the [[Ohrid Literary School]]</span>
				<span class='text'>For seven years (886-893)  Clement taught some 3,500 students in the Slavonic language and the Glagolitic alphabet</span>
