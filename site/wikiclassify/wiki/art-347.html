				<span class='text'>He was born in [[Switzerland]] and became a [[France|French citizen]] in 1930</span>
				<span class='text'>His career spanned five decades, with his buildings constructed throughout Europe, India, and the [[Americas]]</span>
				<span class='text'>edicated to providing better living conditions for the residents of crowded cities, Le Corbusier was influential in [[urban planning]], and was a founding member of the ''[[Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne|Congrès international d'architecture moderne]]'' (CIAM)</span>
				<span class='text'>Corbusier prepared the master plan for the city of [[Chandigarh]] in [[India]], and contributed specific designs for several buildings there</span>

				<span class='text'>He attended a [[kindergarten]] that used [[Friedrich Fröbel|Fröbelian]] methods</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}Young Jeanneret was attracted to the visual arts and studied at the La-Chaux-de-Fonds Art School under [[Charles L'Eplattenier]], who had studied in [[Budapest]] and Paris</span>
				<span class='text'>His architecture teacher in the Art School was the architect René Chapallaz, who had a large influence on Le Corbusier's earliest house designs</span>
				<span class='text'>n his early years he would frequently escape the somewhat [[Provincialism|provincial atmosphere]] of his hometown by traveling around Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>In September 1907, he made his first trip outside of Switzerland, going to Italy; then that winter traveling through Budapest to Vienna, where he would stay for four months and meet [[Gustav Klimt]] and [[Josef Hoffman]]</span>

				<span class='text'>It was both his trip to Italy and his employment at Perret's office that began to form his own ideas about architecture</span>
				<span class='text'>Between October 1910 and March 1911, he worked near [[Berlin]] for the renowned architect [[Peter Behrens]], where he may have met [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] and [[Walter Gropius]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He became fluent in German</span>
				<span class='text'>More than anything during this period, it was his visit to the Charterhouse of the Valley of Ema that influenced his architectural philosophy profoundly for the rest of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>He believed that all people should have the opportunity to live as beautifully and peacefully as the monks he witnessed in the sanctuaries at the charterhouse</span>

				<span class='text'>This model proposed an open floor plan consisting of concrete slabs supported by a minimal number of thin [[reinforced concrete column]]s around the edges, with a stairway providing access to each level on one side of the floor plan</span>
				<span class='text'>his design became the foundation for most of his architecture over the next ten years</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon he began his own architectural practice with his cousin, [[Pierre Jeanneret]] (1896–1967), a partnership that would last until the 1950s, with an interruption in the [[World War II]] years, because of Le Corbusier's ambivalent position towards the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1918, Le Corbusier met the [[Cubism|Cubist]] painter [[Amédée Ozenfant]], in whom he recognised a kindred spirit</span>
				<span class='text'>Ozenfant encouraged him to paint, and the two began a period of collaboration</span>
				<span class='text'>Rejecting Cubism as irrational and &quot;romantic&quot;, the pair jointly published their manifesto, ''Après le cubisme'' and established a new artistic movement, [[Purism (arts)|Purism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Ozenfant and Le Corbusier established the Purist journal ''L'Esprit nouveau''</span>
				<span class='text'>He was good friends with the Cubist artist [[Fernand Léger]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Pseudonym adopted, 1920==[[File:Le Corbusier (Charles-Édouard Jeanneret), 1920, Guitare verticale (2ème version), oil on canvas, 100 x 81 cm, Fondation Le Corbusier, Paris</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Le Corbusier (Charles-Édouard Jeanneret), 1920, ''Guitare verticale'' (2ème version), oil on canvas, 100 x 81 cm, Fondation Le Corbusier, Paris]]In the first issue of the journal, in 1920, Charles-Edouard Jeanneret adopted '''''Le Corbusier''''' (an altered form of his maternal grandfather's name, Lecorbésier) as a pseudonym, reflecting his belief that anyone could reinvent themselves</span>
				<span class='text'>Adopting a single name to identify oneself was in vogue by artists in many fields during that era, especially in Paris</span>
				<span class='text'>etween 1918 and 1922, Le Corbusier did not build anything, concentrating his efforts on Purist theory and painting</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1922, he and his cousin Pierre Jeanneret opened a studio in Paris at 35 rue de Sèvres</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Choay&quot;/&gt;His theoretical studies soon advanced into several different single-family house models</span>
				<span class='text'>Among these was the Maison &quot;Citrohan&quot;, a pun on the name of the French [[Citroën]] automaker, for the modern industrial methods and materials Le Corbusier advocated using for the house</span>
				<span class='text'>Here, Le Corbusier proposed a three-floor structure, with a double-height living room, bedrooms on the second floor, and a kitchen on the third floor</span>
				<span class='text'>The roof would be occupied by a sun terrace</span>
				<span class='text'>On the exterior Le Corbusier installed a stairway to provide second-floor access from ground level</span>
				<span class='text'>Here, as in other projects from this period, he also designed the facades to include large uninterrupted banks of windows</span>
				<span class='text'>The house used a rectangular plan, with exterior walls that were not filled by windows but left as white, stuccoed spaces</span>
				<span class='text'>Le Corbusier and Jeanneret left the interior aesthetically spare, with any movable furniture made of tubular metal frames</span>
				<span class='text'>Light fixtures usually comprised single, bare bulbs</span>
				<span class='text'>Interior walls also were left white</span>
				<span class='text'>Between 1922 and 1927, Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret designed many of these private houses for clients around Paris</span>
				<span class='text'>In [[Boulogne-sur-Seine]] and the 16th arrondissement of Paris, Le Corbusier and Jeanneret designed and built the [[Jacques Lipchitz|Villa Lipschitz]], [[Maison Cook]], [[Maison Planeix]], and the [[Maison La Roche|Maison La Roche/Albert Jeanneret]], which now houses the Fondation Le Corbusier</span>
				<span class='text'>=Relationship with the USSR=={{main|Le Corbusier in the USSR}}Le Corbusier had a short relationship with the [[Soviet Union]], starting with his first trip to [[Moscow]] in 1928, and ending with the rejection of his proposal for the [[Palace of the Soviets]] in 1932</span>
				<span class='text'>=Personal life==While returning in 1929 from South America to Europe, Le Corbusier met entertainer and actress [[Josephine Baker]] on board the ocean liner ''Lutétia''</span>
				<span class='text'>Le Corbusier made several nude sketches of Baker</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon after his return to France, Le Corbusier married Yvonne Gallis, a dressmaker and fashion model</span>
				<span class='text'>She died in 1957</span>
				<span class='text'>Le Corbusier also had a long extramarital affair with Swedish-American heiress Marguerite Tjader Harris</span>
				<span class='text'>e Corbusier became a French citizen in 1930</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|200px|Portrait on [[Banknotes of the Swiss franc#Eighth series|Swiss ten franc banknote]] ]]==Urbanism==For a number of years, French officials had been unsuccessful in dealing with the squalor of the growing Parisian slums, and Le Corbusier sought efficient ways to house large numbers of people in response to the urban housing crisis</span>
				<span class='text'>He believed that his new, modern architectural forms would provide an organizational solution that would raise the quality of life for the lower classes</span>
				<span class='text'>His Immeubles Villas (1922) was such a project, calling for large blocks of cell-like individual apartments stacked one on top of one another, with plans that included a living room, bedrooms, and kitchen, as well as a garden terrace</span>
				<span class='text'>ot merely content with designs for a few housing blocks, Le Corbusier soon moved into studies for entire cities</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1922 he presented his scheme for a &quot;Contemporary City&quot; for three million inhabitants ([[Ville Contemporaine]])</span>
				<span class='text'>The centerpiece of this plan was the group of sixty-story [[cruciform]] skyscrapers, steel-framed office buildings encased in huge curtain walls of glass</span>
				<span class='text'>Referred to as [[towers in a park]], these skyscrapers were set within large, rectangular, park-like green spaces</span>
				<span class='text'>At the center was a huge transportation hub that on different levels included depots for buses and trains, as well as highway intersections, and at the top, an airport</span>
				<span class='text'>Le Corbusier had the fanciful notion that commercial airliners would land between the huge skyscrapers</span>
				<span class='text'>He segregated pedestrian circulation paths from the roadways and glorified the automobile as a means of transportation</span>
				<span class='text'>As one moved out from the central skyscrapers, smaller low-story, zig-zag apartment blocks (set far back from the street amid green space) housed the inhabitants</span>
				<span class='text'>Le Corbusier hoped that politically minded industrialists in France would lead the way with their efficient [[Scientific management|Taylorist]] and [[Fordism|Fordist]] strategies adopted from American industrial models to reorganize society</span>
				<span class='text'>As Norma Evenson has put it, &quot;the proposed city appeared to some an audacious and compelling vision of a brave new world, and to others a frigid megalomaniacally scaled negation of the familiar urban ambient</span>

				<span class='text'>Published by Éditions de l'Esprit Nouveau, Paris]]In this new industrial spirit, Le Corbusier contributed to a new journal called ''L'Esprit Nouveau'' that advocated the use of modern industrial techniques and strategies to transform society into a more efficient environment with a higher standard of living on all socioeconomic levels</span>
				<span class='text'>He forcefully argued that this transformation was necessary to avoid the spectre of revolution that would otherwise shake society</span>
				<span class='text'>His dictum &quot;Architecture or Revolution&quot;, developed in his articles in this journal, became his rallying cry for the book ''Vers une architecture'' (''Toward an Architecture,'' previously mistranslated into English as ''Towards a New Architecture''), which comprised selected articles he contributed to ''L'Esprit Nouveau'' between 1920 and 1923</span>
				<span class='text'>In this book, Le Corbusier followed the influence of [[Walter Gropius]] and reprinted several photographs of North American factories and [[grain elevators]]</span>

				<span class='text'>He exhibited his &quot;Plan Voisin&quot;, sponsored by an automobile manufacturer, in 1925</span>
				<span class='text'>In it, he proposed to bulldoze most of central Paris north of the Seine and replace it with his sixty-story cruciform towers from the Contemporary City, placed within an orthogonal street grid and park-like green space</span>
				<span class='text'>His scheme was met with criticism and scorn from French politicians and industrialists, although they were favorable to the ideas of Taylorism and Fordism underlying his designs</span>
				<span class='text'>Nonetheless, it did provoke discussion concerning how to deal with the cramped, dirty conditions that enveloped much of the city</span>
				<span class='text'>n the 1930s, Le Corbusier expanded and reformulated his ideas on urbanism, eventually publishing them in ''[[Ville Radieuse|La Ville radieuse]]'' (The Radiant City) in 1935</span>
				<span class='text'>Perhaps the most significant difference between the Contemporary City and the Radiant City is that the latter abandoned the class-based stratification of the former; housing was now assigned according to family size, not economic position</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;  He dreamed of &quot;cleaning and purging&quot; the city, bringing &quot;a calm and powerful architecture&quot;—referring to steel, plate glass, and reinforced concrete</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Le Corbusier's designs for Stockholm did not succeed, later architects took his ideas and partly &quot;destroyed&quot; the city with them</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|[[Villa Savoye]]]]It was Le Corbusier's [[Villa Savoye]] (1929–31) that most succinctly summed up the five points of architecture that he had elucidated in ''L'Esprit Nouveau'' and the book ''[[Toward an Architecture|Vers une architecture]]'', which he had been developing throughout the 1920s</span>
				<span class='text'>First, Le Corbusier lifted the bulk of the structure off the ground, supporting it by ''[[piloti]]s'', reinforced concrete stilts</span>
				<span class='text'>These ''pilotis'', in providing the structural support for the house, allowed him to elucidate his next two points: a free facade, meaning non-supporting walls that could be designed as the architect wished, and an [[free plan|open floor plan]], meaning that the floor space was free to be configured into rooms without concern for supporting walls</span>
				<span class='text'>The second floor of the Villa Savoye includes long strips of ribbon windows that allow unencumbered views of the large surrounding garden, and which constitute the fourth point of his system</span>
				<span class='text'>The fifth point was the [[roof garden]] to compensate for the green area consumed by the building and replacing it on the roof</span>
				<span class='text'>A ramp rising from ground level to the third-floor roof terrace allows for an architectural promenade through the structure</span>
				<span class='text'>The white tubular railing recalls the industrial &quot;ocean-liner&quot; aesthetic that Le Corbusier much admired</span>
				<span class='text'>==Modulor==={{Main|Modulor}}Le Corbusier explicitly used the [[golden ratio]] in his [[Modulor]] system for the [[scale (ratio)|scale]] of [[proportion (architecture)|architectural proportion]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He saw this system as a continuation of the long tradition of [[Vitruvius]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s &quot;[[Vitruvian Man]]&quot;, the work of [[Leon Battista Alberti]], and others who used the proportions of the human body to improve the appearance and function of architecture</span>

				<span class='text'>e took Leonardo's suggestion of the golden ratio in human proportions to an extreme: he sectioned his model human body's height at the navel with the two sections in golden ratio, then subdivided those sections in golden ratio at the knees and throat; he used these golden ratio proportions in the [[Modulor]] system</span>

				<span class='text'>==Furniture==={{main|Le Corbusier's Furniture}}Corbusier said: &quot;Chairs are architecture, sofas are [[bourgeois]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>e Corbusier began experimenting with furniture design in 1928 after inviting the architect, [[Charlotte Perriand]], to join his studio</span>
				<span class='text'>His cousin, [[Pierre Jeanneret]], also collaborated on many of the designs</span>
				<span class='text'>Before the arrival of Perriand, Le Corbusier relied on ready-made furniture to furnish his projects, such as the simple pieces manufactured by [[Thonet]], the company that manufactured his designs in the 1930s</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1928, Le Corbusier and Perriand began to put the expectations for furniture Le Corbusier outlined in his 1925 book ''L'Art Décoratif d'aujourd'hui'' into practice</span>
				<span class='text'>In the book he defined three different furniture types: ''type-needs'', ''type-furniture'', and ''human-limb objects''</span>
				<span class='text'>He defined human-limb objects as: &quot;Extensions of our limbs and adapted to human functions that are type-needs and type-functions, therefore type-objects and type-furniture</span>
				<span class='text'>The human-limb object is a docile servant</span>
				<span class='text'>A good servant is discreet and self-effacing in order to leave his master free</span>
				<span class='text'>Certainly, works of art are tools, beautiful tools</span>
				<span class='text'>And long live the good taste manifested by choice, subtlety, proportion, and harmony&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>he first results of the collaboration were three chrome-plated tubular steel chairs designed for two of his projects, The ''Maison la Roche'' in Paris and a pavilion for Barbara and Henry Church</span>
				<span class='text'>The line of furniture was expanded for Le Corbusier's 1929 ''[[Salon d'Automne]]'' installation, 'Equipment for the Home'</span>
				<span class='text'>hese chairs included the LC-1, LC-2, LC-3, and [[Chaise Longue (Le Corbusier)|LC-4]], originally entitled &quot;''Basculant''&quot; (LC-1), &quot;''[[Fauteuil]] grand confort, petit modèle''&quot; (LC-2, &quot;great comfort sofa, small model&quot;), &quot;''Fauteuil grand confort, grand modèle''&quot; (LC-3, &quot;great comfort sofa, large model&quot;), and &quot;''[[Chaise Longue (Le Corbusier)|Chaise longue]]''&quot; (LC-4, &quot;Long chair&quot;)</span>

				<span class='text'>==Politics===In the 1930s, Le Corbusier associated with the [[Faisceau]] of [[Georges Valois]] and [[Hubert Lagardelle]] and briefly edited the [[syndicalist]] journals ''Plans'' and ''Prélude''</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1934, he lectured in Rome on architecture, by invitation of [[Benito Mussolini]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He sought out a position in urban planning in the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] regime and received an appointment on a committee studying urbanism</span>
				<span class='text'>He drew up plans for the redesign of Algiers in which he criticized the perceived differences in living standards between Europeans and Africans in the city, describing a situation in which &quot;the civilised live like rats in holes&quot; yet &quot;the barbarians live in solitude, in well-being</span>

				<span class='text'>After this defeat, Le Corbusier largely eschewed politics</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough the politics of Lagardelle and Valois included elements of fascism, anti-semitism, and ultra-nationalism, Le Corbusier's own affiliation with these movements remains uncertain</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''La Ville radieuse'', he conceives an essentially apolitical society, in which the bureaucracy of economic administration effectively replaces the state</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Fishman|1982|page=228}}Le Corbusier was heavily indebted to the thought of the 19th-century French utopians [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]] and [[Charles Fourier]]</span>

				<span class='text'>=Criticism==Since his death, Le Corbusier's contribution has been hotly contested, as the [[architectural design values|architecture values]] and its accompanying aspects within modern architecture vary, both between different schools of thought and among practising architects</span>

				<span class='text'>[:Category:Historians of technology|Technological historian]] and architecture critic [[Lewis Mumford]] wrote in ''Yesterday's City of Tomorrow'' that the extravagant heights of Le Corbusier's skyscrapers had no reason for existence apart from the fact that they had become technological possibilities</span>
				<span class='text'>The open spaces in his central areas had no reason for existence either, Mumford wrote, since on the scale he imagined there was no motive during the business day for pedestrian circulation in the office quarter</span>
				<span class='text'>By &quot;mating utilitarian and financial image of the skyscraper city to the romantic image of the organic environment, Le Corbusier had, in fact, produced a sterile hybrid</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;The public housing projects influenced by his ideas are seen by some as having had the effect of isolating poor communities in monolithic high-rises and breaking the social ties integral to a community's development</span>
				<span class='text'>One of his most influential detractors has been [[Jane Jacobs]], who delivered a scathing critique of Le Corbusier's urban design theories in her seminal work ''[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>==Influence===[[File:MESP4</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|[[Gustavo Capanema Palace]], Rio de Janeiro ([[Brazil]])]]Le Corbusier was at his most influential in the sphere of [[urban planning]], and was a founding member of the ''[[Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne]]'' (CIAM)</span>
				<span class='text'> One of the first to realize how the [[automobile]] would change human agglomerations, Le Corbusier described the city of the future as consisting of large [[apartment building]]s isolated in a park-like setting on [[piloti]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>Le Corbusier's theories were adopted by the builders of public housing in Europe and the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>In Great Britain urban planners turned to Le Corbusier's &quot;Cities in the Sky&quot; as a cheaper method of providing public housing from the late 1950s</span>

				<span class='text'>k/blog/contemporary-designers/le-corbusier-enfant-terrible-of-modernist-architecture</span>
				<span class='text'>tml&lt;/ref&gt;  For the design of the buildings themselves, Le Corbusier criticized any effort at ornamentation</span>
				<span class='text'>The large spartan structures in cities, but not 'of' cities, have been widely criticized for being boring and unfriendly to pedestrians</span>
				<span class='text'>hroughout the years, many architects worked for Le Corbusier in his studio, and a number of them became notable in their own right, including painter-architect [[Nadir Afonso]], who absorbed Le Corbusier's ideas into his own aesthetics theory</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Lúcio Costa]]'s [[urban planning|city plan]] of [[Brasília]] and the industrial city of [[Zlín]] planned by [[František Lydie Gahura]] in the Czech Republic are notable plans based on his ideas, while the architect himself produced the plan for [[Chandigarh]] in India</span>
				<span class='text'>Le Corbusier's thinking also had profound effects on the philosophy of city planning and architecture in the [[Soviet Union]], particularly in the [[Constructivist architecture|Constructivist]] era</span>
				<span class='text'>e Corbusier was heavily influenced by problems he saw in industrial cities at the turn of the 20th century</span>
				<span class='text'>He thought that industrial housing techniques led to crowding, dirtiness, and a lack of a moral landscape</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a leader of the [[modernism|modernist]] movement to create better living conditions and a better society through housing concepts</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Ebenezer Howard]]'s ''Garden Cities of Tomorrow'' heavily influenced Le Corbusier and his contemporaries</span>
				<span class='text'>e Corbusier also harmonized and lent credence to the idea of space as a set of destinations which mankind moved between, more or less continuously</span>
				<span class='text'> He was therefore able to give credence and credibility to the automobile (as a transporter); and most importantly to freeways in urban spaces</span>
				<span class='text'> His philosophies were useful to urban real estate development interests in the American Post World War II period because they justified and lent architectural and intellectual support to the desire to destroy traditional urban space for high density high profit urban concentration, both commercial and residential</span>
				<span class='text'> Le Corbusier's ideas also sanctioned further destruction of traditional urban spaces to build freeways that connected this new urbanism to low density, low cost (and highly profitable), suburban and rural locales which were free to be developed as middle class single-family (dormitory) housing</span>
				<span class='text'>otably missing from this scheme of movement were connectivity between isolated urban villages created for lower-middle and working classes and other destination points in Le Corbusier's plan: suburban and rural areas, and urban commercial centers</span>
				<span class='text'> This was because, as designed, the freeways traveled over, at, or beneath grade levels of the living spaces of the urban poor (one modern example: the [[Cabrini–Green]] housing project in Chicago)</span>
				<span class='text'>Such projects and their areas, having no freeway exit ramps, cut off by freeway rights-of-way, became isolated from jobs and services concentrated at Le Corbusier's nodal transportation end points</span>
				<span class='text'>As jobs increasingly moved to the suburban end points of the freeways, urban village dwellers found themselves without convenient freeway access points in their communities and without public mass transit connectivity that could economically reach suburban job centers</span>
				<span class='text'>Very late in the Post-War period, suburban job centers found this to be such a critical problem (labor shortages) that they, on their own, began sponsoring urban-to-suburban shuttle bus services between urban villages and suburban job centers, to fill working class and lower-middle class jobs which had gone wanting, and which did not normally pay the wages that car ownership required</span>

				<span class='text'> Le Corbusier deliberately created a myth about himself and was revered in his lifetime, and after death, by a generation of followers who believed Le Corbusier was a prophet who could do no wrong</span>
				<span class='text'>But in the 1950s the first doubts began to appear, notably in some essays by his greatest admirers such as [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]] and [[Colin Rowe]], who denounced as catastrophic his ideas on the city</span>
				<span class='text'>Later critics revealed his technical incompetence as an architect</span>
				<span class='text'>In his book ''Armée du Salut'', Brian Brace Taylor went into great detail about Le Corbusier's Machiavellian activities to create this commission for himself, his many ill-judged design decisions about building technologies, and the sometimes absurd solutions he then proposed</span>

				<span class='text'>We cannot says &quot;there has been much discussion&quot; -- we have to say WHO discussed this and GIVE A CITATION</span>
				<span class='text'>  More recently still there has been much discussion about Le Corbusier's right-wing politics, and his open flirtation with Fascism in the 1930s, when he tried to persuade Benito Mussolini to commission him to design a new capital city for Ethiopia after Mussolini invaded Ethiopia in 1935 using nerve-gas, in breach of League of Nations rules</span>
