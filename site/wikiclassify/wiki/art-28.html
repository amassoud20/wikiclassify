				<span class='text'> Supervision of bureaus and departments whose operations were outside of Washington such as the New York Customs House the Postal Service the Departments of Navy and War and the Bureau of Indian Affairs whose budget had enormously increased in the past two decades proved to be difficult</span>

				<span class='text'>Another notable crisis during Jacksons period of office was the  or secession crisis of 1828–1832 which merged issues of sectional strife with disagreements over tariffs</span>
				<span class='text'>Critics alleged that high tariffs the  on imports of common manufactured goods made in Europe made those goods more expensive than ones from the northern U</span>

				<span class='text'>raising the prices paid by planters in the South</span>
				<span class='text'>Southern politicians argued that tariffs benefited northern industrialists at the expense of southern farmers</span>
				<span class='text'>he issue came to a head when Vice President Calhoun in the  of 1828 supported the claim of his home state  that it had the right to nullify—declare void—the tariff legislation of 1828 and more generally the right of a state to nullify any Federal laws that went against its interests</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Jackson sympathized with the South in the tariff debate he also vigorously supported a strong union with effective powers for the central government</span>

				<span class='text'>During the summer of 1835 controversy over slavery was rekindled throughout the nation as had similarly taken place during the divisive 1819–1820  debates</span>
				<span class='text'>Northern abolitionists were sending anti slavery tracts through the U</span>

				<span class='text'>Postal system into the South</span>
				<span class='text'> Pro slavery Southerners objected believing the tracts were incendiary literature and demanded that the postal service unconditionally ban the sending of any anti slavery tracts into the South</span>
				<span class='text'>On July 29 a pro slavery mob of 300 people led by former governor  broke into the Post Office in Charleston South Carolina and proceeded to seize and destroy abolitionist tracts</span>
				<span class='text'>The Jackson Administration had Southern sympathies over slavery and was hostile to abolitionism</span>
				<span class='text'>However Jackson who demanded sectional peace desired to placate Southerners at the same time resisting antislavery demands without ignoring the interests of Northern Democrats</span>
				<span class='text'>Jacksons Postmaster General  gave Southern postmasters discretionary powers to either send or detain the anti slavery tracts</span>
				<span class='text'>Jackson angrily denounced Northern abolitionists and suggested that the names of abolitionist authors should be published</span>
				<span class='text'>Jackson who wanted the matter quickly resolved also suggested the tracts be mailed only to subscribers</span>
				<span class='text'>In February 1836 Senator  Jacksons former Vice President authored a bill that would prohibit the sending of any anti slavery tracts via the federal mail service</span>

				<span class='text'>Northern Whigs objected that anti slavery petitions were constitutional and should not be forbidden</span>
				<span class='text'> Jackson wanted the issue of these petitions resolved quickly</span>
				<span class='text'>South Carolina Representative  drafted and introduced a resolution that denounced the petitions as sickly sentimentality declared that Congress had no right to interfere with slavery and tabled  all further anti slavery petitions</span>
				<span class='text'>Jackson leaders in Congress supported the measure which was passed quickly and without any debate temporarily suppressing pro abolitionist activities in Congress</span>

				<span class='text'> The new Texas government legalized slavery and demanded recognition from President Jackson and annexation into the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>However Jackson was hesitant with recognizing Texas unconvinced that the new republic could maintain independence from Mexico and not wanting to make Texas an anti slavery issue during the 1836 election</span>
