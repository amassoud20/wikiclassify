				<span class='text'>He was born near the end of the [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial era]], somewhere near the then-unmarked border between [[North Carolina|North]] and [[South Carolina]], into a recently immigrated [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] farming family of relatively modest means</span>
				<span class='text'>During the [[American Revolutionary War]] Jackson, whose family supported the revolutionary cause, acted as a courier</span>
				<span class='text'>He was captured, at age 13, and mistreated by his British captors</span>
				<span class='text'>He later became a lawyer</span>
				<span class='text'>He was elected to the [[U</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1801, Jackson was appointed colonel in the Tennessee militia, which became his political as well as military base</span>
				<span class='text'>Jackson owned hundreds of slaves who worked on the [[The Hermitage (Nashville, Tennessee)|Hermitage plantation]] which he acquired in 1804</span>
				<span class='text'>He killed a man in a duel in 1806, over a matter of honor regarding his wife [[Rachel Jackson|Rachel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Jackson gained national fame through his role in the [[War of 1812]], most famously where he won a decisive victory over the main British invasion army at the [[Battle of New Orleans]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Jackson's army was then sent to Florida where he deposed the small Spanish garrison</span>
				<span class='text'>This led directly to [[Adams–Onís Treaty|the treaty]] which formally transferred Florida from Spain to the United States</span>

				<span class='text'>The Adams campaigners called him and his wife [[Rachel Jackson]] &quot;bigamists&quot;; she died just after the election and he called the slanderers &quot;murderers,&quot; swearing never to forgive them</span>
				<span class='text'>His struggles with Congress were personified in his personal rivalry with Clay, whom Jackson deeply disliked, and who led the opposition (the emerging [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]])</span>
				<span class='text'>As president, he faced a threat of secession from [[South Carolina]] over the &quot;[[Tariff of Abominations]]&quot; which Congress had enacted under Adams</span>
				<span class='text'>In contrast to several of his immediate successors, he denied the right of a state to secede from the union, or to nullify federal law</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Nullification Crisis]] was defused when the tariff was amended and Jackson [[Force Bill|threatened]] the use of military force if South Carolina (or any other state) attempted to secede</span>
				<span class='text'>ongress attempted to reauthorize the [[Second Bank of the United States]] several years before the expiration of its charter, which he opposed</span>
				<span class='text'>He vetoed the renewal of its charter in 1832, and dismantled it by the time its charter expired in 1836</span>
				<span class='text'>Jackson's presidency marked the beginning of the ascendancy of the &quot;[[spoils system]]&quot; in American politics</span>
				<span class='text'>Also, he supported, signed, and enforced the [[Indian Removal Act]], which relocated a number of native tribes to [[Indian Territory]] (now [[Oklahoma]])</span>
				<span class='text'>He faced and defeated Henry Clay in the [[United States presidential election, 1832|1832 Presidential Election]], and opposed Clay generally</span>
				<span class='text'>Jackson supported his vice president [[Martin Van Buren]], who was elected president in 1836</span>

				<span class='text'>But he may have claimed to be a South Carolinian because the state was considering nullification of the [[Tariff of 1824]], which Jackson opposed</span>

				<span class='text'>ng|thumb|right|Jackson's Indian Removal Act and subsequent treaties resulted in the forced removal of several [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian tribes]] from their traditional territories, including  [[Trail of Tears]]]]Throughout his eight years in office, Jackson made about 70 treaties with Native American tribes both in the [[Old Southwest|South]] and the [[Old Northwest|Northwest]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Latner 2002|p=109}} Jackson's presidency marked a new era in Indian-[[European American|Anglo]] American relations initiating a policy of Indian removal</span>
				<span class='text'>{{sfn|Latner 2002|p=108}} Jackson himself sometimes participated in the treaty negotiating process with various Indian tribes, though other times he left the negotiations to his subordinates</span>
				<span class='text'>The southern tribes included the [[Choctaw]], [[Muscogee|Creek]], [[Chickasaw]], [[Seminole]] and the [[Cherokee]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The northwest tribes include the [[Chippewa]], [[Ottawa]], and the [[Potawatomi]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Though conflict between Indians and American settlers took place in the north and in the south, the problem was worse in the south where the Indian populations were larger</span>
				<span class='text'>Indian wars broke out repeatedly, often when native tribes, especially the [[Muscogee]] and [[Seminole]] Indians, refused to abide by the treaties for various reasons</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Latner 2002|p=110}} The [[Second Seminole War]], started in December 1835, lasted over six years finally ending in August 1842 under President [[John Tyler]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Latner 2002|p=110}}Though relations between Europeans (and later Americans) and Indians were always complicated, they grew increasingly complicated once American settlements began pushing further west in the years after the [[American Revolution]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Often these relations were peaceful, though they increasingly grew tense and sometimes even violent, both on the part of American settlers and the Indians</span>
				<span class='text'>From [[George Washington]] to John Quincy Adams, the problem was typically ignored or dealt with lightly; though by Jackson's time the earlier policy had grown unsustainable</span>
				<span class='text'>The problem was especially acute in the south (in particular the lands near the state of [[Georgia (U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>state)|Georgia]]), where Indian populations were larger, denser, and more Americanized than those of the north</span>
				<span class='text'>As such, there had developed a growing popular and political movement to deal with the problem, and out of this developed a policy to relocate certain Indian populations</span>
				<span class='text'>Jackson, never one known for timidity, became an advocate for this relocation policy in what is considered by some historians to be the most controversial aspect of his presidency</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Latner 2002|p=108}} This contrasted from his immediate predecessor, President [[John Quincy Adams|John Q</span>
				<span class='text'>Adams]], who tended to follow the policy of his own predecessors, that of letting the problem play itself out with minimal intervention</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Latner 2002|p=108}} Jackson's presidency thus took place in a new era in Indian-[[European American|Anglo]] American relations, in that it marked federal action and a policy of relocation</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Latner 2002|p=108}} As such, during Jackson's presidency, Indian relations between the Southern tribes and the state governments had reached a critical juncture</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Latner 2002|p=109}}In his December 8, 1829, First Annual Message to Congress, Jackson advocated land west of the [[Mississippi River]] be set aside for Indian tribes</span>
				<span class='text'>Congress had been developing its own Indian relocation bill, and Jackson had many supporters in both the Senate and House who agreed with his goal</span>
				<span class='text'>On May 26, 1830 Congress passed the [[Indian Removal Act]], and Jackson signed it into law</span>
				<span class='text'>The Act authorized the President to negotiate treaties to buy tribal lands in the east in exchange for lands further west, outside of existing U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>state borders</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Latner 2002|p=109}} The passage of the bill was Jackson's first successful legislative triumph and marked the Democratic party's emergence into American political society</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Latner 2002|p=109}} The passage of the act was especially popular in the [[Southern United States|South]] where population growth and the discovery of gold on [[Cherokee]] land had increased pressure on tribal lands</span>
				<span class='text'>he state of [[Georgia (U</span>

				<span class='text'>In that decision, [[U</span>

				<span class='text'>{{sfn|Ellis 1974|p=62}}===Nullification crisis==={{Main|Nullification Crisis}}Another notable crisis during Jackson's period of office was the &quot;[[Nullification Crisis]]&quot;, or &quot;secession crisis&quot;, of 1828–1832, which merged issues of sectional strife with disagreements over tariffs</span>
				<span class='text'>Critics alleged that high tariffs (the &quot;[[Tariff of Abominations]]&quot;) on imports of common manufactured goods made in Europe made those goods more expensive than ones from the northern U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> raising the prices paid by planters in the South</span>
				<span class='text'>Southern politicians argued that tariffs benefited northern industrialists at the expense of southern farmers</span>
				<span class='text'>he issue came to a head when Vice President Calhoun, in the [[South Carolina Exposition and Protest]] of 1828, supported the claim of his home state, [[South Carolina]], that it had the right to &quot;nullify&quot;—declare void—the tariff legislation of 1828, and more generally the right of a state to nullify any Federal laws that went against its interests</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Jackson sympathized with the South in the tariff debate, he also vigorously supported a strong union, with effective powers for the central government</span>
				<span class='text'>Jackson attempted to face down Calhoun over the issue, which developed into a bitter rivalry between the two men</span>
				<span class='text'>articularly notable was an incident at the April 13, 1830, Jefferson Day dinner, involving after-dinner toasts</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Robert Hayne]] began by toasting to &quot;The Union of the States, and the Sovereignty of the States&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Jackson then rose, and in a booming voice added &quot;Our federal Union: It must be preserved!&quot;&amp;nbsp;– a clear challenge to Calhoun</span>
				<span class='text'>Calhoun clarified his position by responding &quot;The Union: Next to our Liberty, the most dear!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ogg, 164</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;At the [[1832 Democratic National Convention|first Democratic National Convention]], which was privately engineered by members of the Kitchen Cabinet, Calhoun and Jackson broke from each other politically and Van Buren replaced Calhoun as Jackson's running mate in the [[United States presidential election, 1832|1832 presidential election]]</span>

				<span class='text'>n response to South Carolina's nullification claim, Jackson vowed to send troops to [[South Carolina]] to enforce the laws</span>
				<span class='text'>In December 1832, he issued a resounding proclamation against the &quot;nullifiers&quot;, stating that he considered &quot;the power to annul a law of the United States, assumed by one State, incompatible with the existence of the Union, contradicted expressly by the letter of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], unauthorized by its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded, and destructive of the great object for which it was formed&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>South Carolina, the President declared, stood on &quot;the brink of insurrection and treason&quot;, and he appealed to the people of the state to reassert their allegiance to that Union for which their ancestors had fought</span>
				<span class='text'>Jackson also denied the right of secession: &quot;The Constitution&amp;nbsp;</span>

				<span class='text'>Finally, he told his interrogators that he was a deposed English King—specifically, [[Richard III of England|Richard III]], dead since 1485—and that Jackson was his clerk</span>
				<span class='text'>He was deemed insane and was institutionalized</span>

				<span class='text'>==Slavery controversies=======Anti-slavery tracts====During the summer of 1835, controversy over slavery was rekindled throughout the nation, as had similarly taken place during the divisive 1819–1820 [[Missouri Compromise]] debates</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Latner 2002|page=117}} Northern abolitionists were sending anti-slavery tracts through the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Postal system into the South</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Latner 2002|page=117}}  Pro slavery Southerners objected believing the tracts were &quot;incendiary literature&quot; and demanded that the postal service unconditionally ban the sending of any anti-slavery tracts into the South</span>
				<span class='text'>On July 29, a pro-slavery mob of 300 people led by former governor [[Robert Y</span>
				<span class='text'>Hayne]] broke into the Post Office in Charleston, South Carolina and proceeded to seize and destroy abolitionist tracts</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Eaton 1942|page=358}} The Jackson Administration had Southern sympathies over slavery and was hostile to abolitionism</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Latner 2002|page=117}} However, Jackson, who demanded sectional peace, desired to placate Southerners; at the same time resisting antislavery demands without ignoring the interests of Northern Democrats</span>
				<span class='text'>Jackson's Postmaster General [[Amos Kendall]] gave Southern postmasters discretionary powers to either send or detain the anti-slavery tracts</span>
				<span class='text'>Jackson angrily denounced Northern abolitionists and suggested that the names of abolitionist authors should be published</span>
				<span class='text'>Jackson, who wanted the matter quickly resolved, also suggested the tracts be mailed only to subscribers</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Latner 2002|page=117}} In February 1836, Senator [[John C</span>
				<span class='text'>Calhoun]], Jackson's former Vice President, authored a bill that would prohibit the sending of any anti-slavery tracts via the federal mail service</span>
				<span class='text'>The bill however failed to gain enough votes to pass in the House</span>
				<span class='text'>Many Southern postmasters, however, disregarded matters of federal law and simply refused to send the anti-slavery tracts</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Latner 2002|page=117}}====Anti-slavery Congressional petitions====In the same year another controversy took place, when abolitionists sent the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>House of Representatives petitions to end the slave trade and slavery in Washington, D</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Latner 2002|page=118}} This infuriated pro-slavery Southerners, who attempted to prevent acknowledgement or discussion of the petitions</span>
				<span class='text'>On December 18, 1835 South Carolina congressman [[James Henry Hammond|James H</span>
				<span class='text'>Hammond]] strongly denounced abolitionists as &quot;ignorant fanatics&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Northern Whigs objected that anti-slavery petitions were constitutional and should not be forbidden</span>
				<span class='text'>{{sfn|Latner 2002|page=118}} Jackson wanted the issue of these petitions resolved quickly</span>
				<span class='text'>South Carolina Representative [[Henry L</span>
				<span class='text'>Pinckney]] drafted and introduced a resolution that denounced the petitions as &quot;sickly sentimentality&quot;, declared that Congress had no right to interfere with slavery, and tabled (''[[gag rule]]'') all further anti-slavery petitions</span>
				<span class='text'>Jackson leaders in Congress supported the measure, which was passed quickly and without any debate; temporarily suppressing pro-abolitionist activities in Congress</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Latner 2002|page=118}}====Recognition of Republic of Texas====In 1835, pro-slavery American settlers in Texas fought the Mexican government; by May 1836, they had routed the Mexican military for the time being, establishing an independent [[Republic of Texas]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{{sfn|Latner 2002|page=120}} The new Texas government legalized slavery and demanded recognition from President Jackson and annexation into the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Jackson was hesitant with recognizing Texas, unconvinced that the new republic could maintain independence from Mexico, and not wanting to make Texas an anti-slavery issue during the 1836 election</span>
				<span class='text'>{{sfn|Latner 2002|page=120}} The strategy worked; the Democratic Party and national loyalties were held intact, while Democratic candidate Van Buren was elected President</span>

				<span class='text'>However, wanting to establish his presidential legacy, similar to [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]], Jackson finally sponsored scientific exploration during his second  term</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Mills 2003|page=705}}   On May 18, 1836 Jackson signed a law creating and funding the oceanic [[United States Exploring Expedition]]</span>
