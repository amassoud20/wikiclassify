				<span class='text'>gg|'|s|t|e|f|a|n|-|'|b|a|n|a|x}}; 30 March 1892 – 31 August 1945) was a [[Poles|Polish]] [[mathematician]] who is generally considered one of the world's most important and influential 20th-century mathematicians</span>
				<span class='text'> He was one of the founders of modern [[functional analysis]], and an original member of the [[Lwów School of Mathematics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His major work was the 1932 book, ''Théorie des opérations linéaires'' (Theory of Linear Operations), the first monograph on the general theory of functional analysis</span>
				<span class='text'>orn in [[Kraków]], Banach attended Henryk Sienkiewicz [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]], a secondary school, and worked on mathematics problems with his friend Witold Wiłkosz</span>
				<span class='text'>After graduating in 1910, Banach and Wiłkosz moved to [[Lwów]]</span>
				<span class='text'>However, during [[World War I]] Banach returned to Kraków, where he befriended [[Hugo Steinhaus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After Banach solved some mathematics problems which Steinhaus considered difficult, they published their first joint work</span>
				<span class='text'> In 1919, with several other mathematicians, Banach formed a mathematical society</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1920 he received an assistantship at the [[Jagiellonian University]]</span>
				<span class='text'> He soon became a professor at the [[Lwów Polytechnic]], and a member of the [[Polish Academy of Learning]]</span>
				<span class='text'> He organized the &quot;[[Lwów School of Mathematics]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'> Around 1929 he began writing his ''Théorie des opérations linéaires''</span>
				<span class='text'>fter the outbreak of [[World War II]], in September 1939, Lwów was taken over by the [[Soviet Union]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Banach became a member of the [[Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]] and was dean of Lwów University's Department of Mathematics and Physics</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1941, when the Germans took over Lwów, all institutions of higher education were closed to Poles</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, Banach was forced to earn a living as a [[feeder of lice]] at [[Rudolf Weigl]]'s [[Institute for Study of Typhus and Virology]]</span>
				<span class='text'>While the job carried the risk of infection with [[typhus]], it protected him from being sent to slave labor in Germany and from other forms of repression</span>
				<span class='text'>When the Soviets recaptured Lwów in 1944, Banach reestablished the University</span>
				<span class='text'>However, because the Soviets were removing Poles from Soviet-annexed formerly-Polish territories, Banach prepared to return to Kraków</span>
				<span class='text'> Before he could do so, he died in August 1945, having been diagnosed seven months earlier with lung cancer</span>
				<span class='text'>ome of the notable [[mathematical]] [[concept]]s that bear Banach's name include [[Banach space]]s, [[Banach algebra]]s, the [[Banach–Tarski paradox]], the [[Hahn–Banach theorem]], the [[Banach–Steinhaus theorem]], the [[Banach-Mazur game]], the [[Banach–Alaoglu theorem]], and the [[Banach fixed-point theorem]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Life=====Early life===Stefan Banach was born on 30 March 1892 at St</span>
				<span class='text'>Lazarus General Hospital in [[Kraków]], then part of the [[Austria–Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Banach's parents were Stefan Greczek and Katarzyna Banach, both natives of the [[Podhale]] region</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Waksmundzka-Hajnos&quot;/&gt; Greczek was a soldier in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] stationed in Kraków</span>
				<span class='text'>Little is known about Banach's mother</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;MacTutor Banach&quot;/&gt;Unusually, Stefan's surname was that of his mother instead of his father, though he received his father's given name, Stefan</span>
				<span class='text'>Since Stefan Greczek was a [[private (rank)|private]] and was prevented by military regulations from [[marriage|marrying]], and the mother was too poor to support the child, the couple decided that he should be reared by family and friends</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Kałuża-2–4&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kałuża|1996|pp=2–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stefan spent the first few years of his life with his grandmother, but when she took ill Greczek arranged for his son to be raised by Franciszka Płowa and her niece Maria Puchalska in Kraków</span>
				<span class='text'>Young Stefan would regard Franciszka as his foster mother and Maria as his older sister</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Kałuża-1-3&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kałuża|1996|pp=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his early years Banach was tutored by Juliusz Mien, a French intellectual and friend of the Płowa family, who had emigrated to Poland and supported himself with photography and translations of Polish literature into French</span>
				<span class='text'>Mien taught Banach French and most likely encouraged him in his early mathematical pursuits</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Kałuża-3&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kałuża|1996|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;In 1902 Banach, aged 10, enrolled in Kraków's ''Henryk Sienkiewicz Gymnasium'' (also known as the ''[[Jan Albin Goetz|Goetz Gymnasium]]'')</span>
				<span class='text'>While the school specialized in the [[humanities]], Banach and his best friend Witold Wiłkosz (also a future mathematician) spent most of their time working on mathematics problems during breaks and after school</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Kałuża-137&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kałuża|1996|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in life Banach would credit Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Kamil Kraft, the mathematics and physics teacher at the gymnasium with kindling his interests in mathematics</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;rem4&quot;/&gt; While generally Banach was a diligent student he did on occasion receive low grades (he failed Greek during his first semester at the gymnasium) and would later speak critically of the school's math teachers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Kałuża-3-4&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kałuża|1996|pp=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;After obtaining his ''[[matura]]'' (high school degree) at age 18 in 1910, Banach and his friend Wiłkosz moved to [[Lwów]] with the intention of studying at the [[Lwów Polytechnic]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He initially chose engineering as his field of study since at the time he was convinced that there was nothing new to discover in mathematics</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;rem5&quot;/&gt; At some point he also attended [[Jagiellonian University]] in Kraków on a part-time basis</span>
				<span class='text'>As Banach had to earn money to support his studies it was not until 1914 that he finally, at age 22, passed his high school graduation exams</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Kałuża-13&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kałuża|1996|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;When [[World War I]] broke out, Banach was excused from military service due to his left-handedness and poor vision</span>
				<span class='text'>When the [[Imperial Russian Army|Russian Army]] opened its offensive toward Lwów, Banach left for Kraków, where he spent the rest of the war</span>
				<span class='text'>He made his living as a [[tutor]] at the local gymnasiums, worked in a bookstore and as a foreman of road building crew</span>
				<span class='text'>He may have attended lectures at the [[Jagiellonian University]] at that time, including those of the famous Polish mathematician [[Stanisław Zaremba (mathematician)|Stanisław Zaremba]], but little is known of that period of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Kałuża-16&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kałuża|1996|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;===Discovery by Steinhaus===In 1916, in Kraków's ''[[Planty Park|Planty]]'' gardens, Banach encountered Professor [[Hugo Steinhaus]], one of the renowned mathematicians of the time</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Steinhaus, while he was strolling through the gardens he was surprised to overhear the term ''&quot;Lebesgue measure&quot;'' ([[Lebesgue integration]] was at the time still a fairly new idea in mathematics) and walked over to investigate</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result he met Banach, as well as [[Otto Nikodym]] and Wilkosz</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;rem6&quot;/&gt; Steinhaus became fascinated with the self-taught young mathematician</span>
				<span class='text'>The encounter resulted in a long-lasting collaboration and friendship</span>
				<span class='text'>In fact, soon after the encounter Steinhaus invited Banach to solve some problems he had been working on but which had proven difficult</span>
				<span class='text'>Banach solved them within a week and the two soon published their first joint work (''On the Mean Convergence of Fourier Series'')</span>
				<span class='text'>Steinhaus, Banach and Nikodym, along with several other Kraków mathematicians ([[Władysław Ślebodziński]], [[Leon Chwistek]], [[Jan Kroć]], and [[Włodzimierz Stożek]]) also established a mathematical society, which eventually became the [[Polish Mathematical Society]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Kaluza-23&quot;/&gt; The society was officially founded on April 2, 1919</span>
				<span class='text'>It was also through Steinhaus that Banach met his future wife, Łucja Braus</span>
				<span class='text'>==Interbellum===[[File:Lwow - Kawiarnia Szkocka</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|200px|[[Scottish Café]], meeting place of many famous Lwów mathematicians]]Steinhaus introduced Banach to academic circles and substantially accelerated his career</span>
				<span class='text'>After [[Second Polish Republic|Poland regained independence]], in 1920 Banach was given an assistantship at Kraków's Jagiellonian University</span>
				<span class='text'>Steinhaus' backing also allowed him to receive a [[doctorate]] without actually graduating from a university</span>
				<span class='text'>The doctoral thesis, accepted by [[Lviv University|King John II Casimir University of Lwów]] in 1920 &lt;ref name=&quot;Jahnke&quot;/&gt; and published in 1922,&lt;ref name=&quot;Fundamenta&quot;/&gt; included the basic ideas of functional analysis, which was soon to become an entirely new branch of mathematics</span>
				<span class='text'>The thesis was widely discussed in academic circles and allowed him in 1922 to become a professor at the Lwów Polytechnic</span>
				<span class='text'>Initially an assistant to Professor [[Antoni Łomnicki]], in 1927 Banach received his own chair</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1924 he was also accepted as a member of the [[Polish Academy of Learning]]</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time, from 1922, Banach also headed the second Chair of Mathematics at [[Lviv University|University of Lwów]]</span>
				<span class='text'>oung and talented, Banach gathered around him a large group of mathematicians</span>
				<span class='text'>The group, meeting in the [[Scottish Café]], soon gave birth to the &quot;Lwów School of Mathematics&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1929 the group began publishing its own journal, ''[[Studia Mathematica]]'', devoted primarily to Banach's field of study — functional analysis</span>
				<span class='text'>Around that time, Banach also began working on his best-known work, the first monograph on the general theory of [[linear space|linear]]-[[metric space]]</span>
				<span class='text'>First published in Polish in 1931,&lt;ref name=&quot;Teoria&quot;/&gt; the following year it was also translated into French and gained wider recognition in European academic circles</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Theorie&quot;/&gt; The book was also the first in a long series of mathematics monographs edited by Banach and his circle</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|200px|Banach's grave, [[Lychakiv Cemetery]], [[Lviv]] (''[[Lwów]]'', in [[Polish language|Polish]])]]Following the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invasion of Poland]] by [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]], Lwów came under the control of the [[Soviet Union]] for almost two years</span>
				<span class='text'>Banach, from 1939 a [[corresponding member]] of the [[Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]], and on good terms with [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] mathematicians,&lt;ref name=&quot;MacTutor Banach&quot;/&gt; had to promise to learn Ukrainian to be allowed to keep his chair and continue his academic activities</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Urbaniak&quot;/&gt; Following the German takeover of Lwów in 1941 during [[Operation Barbarossa]], all universities were closed and Banach, along with many colleagues and his son, was employed as [[Feeder of lice|lice feeder]] at Professor [[Rudolf Weigl]]'s [[Typhus]] Research Institute</span>
				<span class='text'>Employment in Weigl's Institute provided many unemployed university professors and their associates protection from random arrest and deportation to [[Nazi concentration camps]]</span>
				<span class='text'>fter the [[Red Army]] recaptured [[Lwów|Lviv]] in the [[Lvov–Sandomierz Offensive]] of 1944, Banach returned to the University and helped re-establish it after the war years</span>
				<span class='text'>However, because the Soviets were [[Repatriation of Poles (1944–1946)|removing Poles]] from annexed formerly Polish territories, Banach began preparing to leave the city and settle in [[Kraków]], [[Poland]], where he had been promised a chair at the [[Jagiellonian University]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;MacTutor Banach&quot;/&gt; He was also considered a candidate for Minister of Education of Poland</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;remark&quot;/&gt; In January 1945, however, he was diagnosed with lung cancer and was allowed to stay in Lwów</span>
				<span class='text'>He died on August 31, 1945, aged 53</span>
				<span class='text'>His funeral at the [[Lychakiv Cemetery]] was attended by hundreds of people</span>

				<span class='text'>]Banach's dissertation, completed in 1920 and published in 1922, formally axiomatized the concept of a [[complete metric space|complete]] [[normed vector space]] and laid the foundations for the area of [[functional analysis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In this work Banach called such spaces ''&quot;class E-spaces&quot;'', but in his 1932 book, ''Théorie des opérations linéaires'', he changed terminology and referred to them as ''&quot;spaces of type B&quot;'', which most likely contributed to the subsequent [[eponym]]ous naming of these spaces after him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Mac&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|MacCluer|2008|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of what came to be known as [[Banach spaces]] had antecedents in the work of the Hungarian mathematician [[Frigyes Riesz]] (published in 1916) and contemporaneous contributions from [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]] and [[Norbert Wiener]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Jahnke&quot;/&gt; For a brief period in fact, complete normed linear spaces were referred to as &quot;Banach-Wiener&quot; spaces in mathematical literature, based on terminology introduced by Wiener himself</span>
				<span class='text'>However, because Wiener's work on the topic was limited, the established name became just ''Banach spaces''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Mac&quot;/&gt;Likewise, [[Banach fixed-point theorem|Banach's fixed point theorem]], based on earlier methods developed by [[Charles Émile Picard]], was included in his dissertation, and was later extended by his students (for example in the [[Banach–Schauder theorem]]) and other mathematicians (in particular Brouwer and [[Poincaré–Birkhoff theorem|Poincaré and Birkhoff]])</span>
