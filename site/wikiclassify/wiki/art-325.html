				<span class='text'>irby grew up poor in New York City, and learned to draw cartoon figures by tracing characters from comic strips and editorial cartoons</span>
				<span class='text'>He entered the nascent comics industry in the 1930s, drawing various comics features under different [[pen name]]s, including Jack Curtiss, before ultimately settling on Jack Kirby</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1940, he and writer-editor [[Joe Simon]] created the highly successful [[superhero]] character [[Captain America]] for [[Timely Comics]], predecessor of [[Marvel Comics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>During the 1940s, Kirby, generally teamed with Simon, created numerous characters for that company and for National Comics, later to become [[DC Comics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>fter serving in [[World War II]], Kirby produced work for a number of publishers, including DC, [[Harvey Comics]], [[Hillman Periodicals]]</span>
				<span class='text'>At [[Crestwood Publications]] he and Simon created the genre of [[romance comics]] and later founded their own short-lived comic company, [[Mainline Publications]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Ultimately, Kirby  found himself at Timely's 1950s iteration, [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], which in the next decade became Marvel</span>
				<span class='text'>There, in the 1960s, Kirby and writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] co-created many of the company's major characters, including the [[Fantastic Four]], the [[X-Men]], and the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Lee-Kirby titles garnered high sales and critical acclaim, but in 1970, feeling he had been treated unfairly, Kirby left the company for rival DC</span>
				<span class='text'>t DC, Kirby created his [[Fourth World (comics)|Fourth World]] saga, which spanned several comics titles</span>
				<span class='text'>While these series proved commercially unsuccessful and were canceled, the Fourth World's [[New Gods]] have continued as a significant part of the [[DC Universe]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Kirby returned to Marvel briefly in the mid-to-late 1970s, then ventured into [[television animation]] and [[independent comics]]</span>
