				<span class='text'>]Tipu Sultan's father had expanded on [[Mysorean rockets|Mysore's use of rocketry]], making critical innovations in the rockets themselves and the military logistics of their use</span>
				<span class='text'>He deployed as many as 1,200 specialised troops in his army to operate rocket launchers</span>
				<span class='text'>These men were skilled in operating the weapons and were trained to launch their rockets at an angle calculated from the diameter of the cylinder and the distance to the target</span>
				<span class='text'>The rockets had blades mounted on them, and could wreak significant damage when fired ''en masse'' against a large army</span>
				<span class='text'>Tipu greatly expanded the use of rockets after Hyder's death, deploying as many as 5,000 rocketeers at a time</span>
				<span class='text'>The rockets deployed by Tipu during the Battle of Pollilur were much more advanced than those the British East India Company had previously seen, chiefly because of the use of iron tubes for holding the propellant; this enabled higher thrust and longer range for the missiles (up to 2&amp;nbsp;km range)</span>

				<span class='text'>During the climactic battle at Srirangapatna in 1799, British shells struck a magazine containing rockets, causing it to explode and send a towering cloud of black smoke with cascades of exploding white light rising up from the battlements</span>
				<span class='text'>After Tipu's defeat in the fourth war the British captured a number of the Mysorean rockets</span>

				<span class='text'>On few occasions Tippu's army managed to reach Madikeri(Capital of Kodagu) but the Kodavas always ambushed the contingent left behind by Tippu</span>

				<span class='text'>For instance, there were a significant number of forced conversions of British captives between 1780 and 1784</span>
				<span class='text'>Following their disastrous defeat at the 1780 [[Battle of Pollilur]], 7,000 British men along with an unknown number of women were held captive by Tipu in the fortress of Seringapatnam</span>
				<span class='text'>Of these, over 300 were circumcised and given Muslim names and clothes and several British regimental drummer boys were made to wear ''[[ghagra cholis]]'' and entertain the court as ''nautch'' girls or dancing girls</span>
				<span class='text'>After the 10-year-long captivity ended, James Scurry, one of those prisoners, recounted that he had forgotten how to sit in a chair and use a knife and fork</span>
				<span class='text'>His English was broken and stilted, having lost all his vernacular idiom</span>
				<span class='text'>His skin had darkened to the swarthy complexion of [[negro]]es, and moreover, he had developed an aversion to wearing European clothes</span>

				<span class='text'>8&lt;/ref&gt;During the surrender of the Mangalore fort which was delivered in an armistice by the British and their subsequent withdrawal, all the [[Mestizos]] and remaining non-British foreigners were killed, together with 5,600 Mangalorean Catholics</span>
				<span class='text'>Those condemned by Tipu Sultan for treachery were hanged instantly, the gibbets being weighed down by the number of bodies they carried</span>
				<span class='text'>The Netravati River was so putrid with the stench of dying bodies, that the local residents were forced to leave their riverside homes</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Lobo&quot;/&gt;The Archbishop of Goa wrote in 1800, ''&quot;It is notoriously known in all Asia and all other parts of the globe of the oppression and sufferings experienced by the Christians in the Dominion of the King of Kanara, during the usurpation of that country by Tipu Sultan from an implacable hatred he had against them who professed Christianity</span>

				<span class='text'>Many churches in the [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]] and [[Cochin]] were damaged</span>
				<span class='text'>The old Syrian Nasrani seminary at Angamaly which had been the center of Catholic religious education for several centuries was razed to the ground by Tipu's soldiers</span>
				<span class='text'>A lot of centuries old religious manuscripts were lost forever</span>
				<span class='text'>The church was later relocated to Kottayam where it still exists to this date</span>
				<span class='text'>The Mor Sabor church at Akaparambu and the Martha Mariam Church attached to the seminary were destroyed as well</span>
				<span class='text'>Tipu's army set fire to the church at Palayoor and attacked the Ollur Church in 1790</span>
				<span class='text'>Furthernmore, the Arthat church and the Ambazhakkad seminary was also destroyed</span>
				<span class='text'>Over the course of this invasion, many Syrian Malabar Nasrani were killed or forcibly converted to Islam</span>
				<span class='text'>Most of the coconut, arecanut, pepper and cashew plantations held by the Syrian Malabar farmers were also indiscriminately destroyed by the invading army</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, when Tipu's army invaded Guruvayur and adjacent areas, the Syrian Christian community fled Calicut and small towns like Arthat to new centres like Kunnamkulam, Chalakudi, Ennakadu, Cheppadu, Kannankode, [[Mavelikkara]], etc</span>
				<span class='text'>where there were already Christians</span>
				<span class='text'>They were given refuge by Sakthan Tamburan, the ruler of Cochin and Karthika Thirunal, the ruler of Travancore, who gave them lands, plantations and encouraged their businesses</span>

				<span class='text'>Tipu Sultan's Account of the last Phase of the Second War with the English, 1783-4&quot; ''State and Diplomacy Under Tipu Sultan'' (Delhi) 2001 p5; Mohibbul Hasan writes &quot;The reasons why Tipu was reviled are not far to seek</span>
				<span class='text'>Englishmen were prejudiced against him because they regarded him as their most formidable rival and an inveterate enemy, and because, unlike other Indian rulers, he refused to become a tributary of the English Company</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of the atrocities of which he has been accused were allegedly fabricated either by persons embittered and angry on account of the defeats which they had sustained at his hands, or by the prisoners of war who had suffered punishments which they thought they did not deserve</span>
				<span class='text'>He was also misrepresented by those who were anxious to justify the wars of aggression which the Company's Government had waged against him</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, his achievements were deliberately belittled and his character blackened in order that the people of Mysore might forget him and rally round the Raja, thus helping in the consolidation of the new regime&quot; ''The History of Tipu Sultan'' (Delhi) 1971 p368&lt;/ref&gt; This assessment is echoed by Brittlebank in her recent work where she writes that Wilks and Kirkpatrick must be used with particular care as both authors had taken part in the wars against Tipu Sultan and were closely connected to the administrations of [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]] and [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley]]</span>
