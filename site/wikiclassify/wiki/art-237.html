				<span class='text'>The rhetorician [[Quintillian]] regarded his ''[[Odes (Horace)|Odes]]'' as just about the only Latin lyrics worth reading: &quot;He can be lofty sometimes, yet he is also full of charm and grace, versatile in his figures, and felicitously daring in his choice of words</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Quintilian 10</span>

				<span class='text'>The only other lyrical poet Quintillian thought comparable with Horace was the now obscure poet/metrical theorist, [[Caesius Bassus]] (R</span>
				<span class='text'>Tarrant, ''Ancient receptions of Horace'', 280)&lt;/ref&gt;Horace also crafted elegant [[Prosody (Latin)|hexameter verses]] (''[[Satires (Horace)|Sermones]]'' and ''[[Epistles (Horace)|Epistles]]'') and caustic [[Iambus (genre)|iambic poetry]] (''[[Epodes]]'')</span>
				<span class='text'>The hexameters are amusing yet serious works, friendly in tone, leading the ancient satirist [[Persius]] to comment: &quot;as his friend laughs, Horace slyly puts his finger on his every fault; once let in, he plays about the heartstrings&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Translated from Persius' own 'Satires' 1</span>
				<span class='text'>16–17: &quot;omne vafer vitium ridenti Flaccus amico / tangit et admissus circum praecordia ludit</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt;His career coincided with Rome's momentous change from Republic to Empire</span>
				<span class='text'>An officer in the republican army defeated at the [[Battle of Philippi]] in 42 BC, he was befriended by Octavian's right-hand man in civil affairs, [[Maecenas]],  and became a spokesman for the new regime</span>
				<span class='text'>For some commentators, his association with the regime was a delicate balance in which he maintained a strong measure of independence (he was &quot;a master of the graceful sidestep&quot;)&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;J</span>

				<span class='text'>Kiernan, ''Horace: Poetics and Politics'', 24&lt;/ref&gt; One of the works he probably studied in school was the ''Odyssia'' of [[Livius Andronicus]], crammed into Italian boys with threats and floggings by teachers like the '[[Orbilius]]' mentioned in one of his poems</span>

				<span class='text'>Fraenkel, ''Horace'', 2–3&lt;/ref&gt; Such state-sponsored migration must have added still more linguistic variety to the area</span>

				<span class='text'>4&lt;/ref&gt; a colony of Romans or Latins had been installed in Venusia after the [[Samnites]] had been driven out early in the third century</span>
				<span class='text'>In that case, young Horace could have felt himself to be a Roman&lt;ref&gt;T</span>
				<span class='text'>Frank, ''Catullus and Horace'', 133–34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A</span>
				<span class='text'>Campbell, ''Horace: A New Interpretation'', 84&lt;/ref&gt; though there are also indications that he regarded himself as a Samnite or [[Sabellus]] by birth</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Epistles'' 1</span>
				<span class='text'>6</span>
				<span class='text'>9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R</span>
				<span class='text'>Nisbet, ''Horace: life and chronology'', 7&lt;/ref&gt; Italians in modern and ancient times have always been devoted to their home towns, even after success in the wider world, and Horace was no different</span>
				<span class='text'>Images of his childhood setting and references to it are found throughout his poems</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;E</span>
				<span class='text'>Fraenkel, ''Horace'', 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;Horace's father was probably a Venutian taken captive by Romans in the Social War, or possibly he was descended from a [[Sabine]] captured in the [[Samnite Wars]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Either way, he was a slave for at least part of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>He was evidently a man of strong abilities however and managed to gain his freedom and improve his social position</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus Horace claimed to be the free-born son of a prosperous 'coactor'</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Kiernan&quot;/&gt; The term 'coactor' could denote various roles, such as tax collector, but its use by Horace&lt;ref&gt;''Satires'' 1</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>6&lt;/ref&gt; was explained by [[scholia]] as a reference to 'coactor argentareus' i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>an auctioneer with some of the functions of a banker, paying the seller out of his own funds and later recovering the sum with interest from the buyer</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;E</span>
				<span class='text'>Fraenkel, ''Horace'', 4–5&lt;/ref&gt;The father spent a small fortune on his son's education, eventually accompanying him to [[Rome]] to oversee his schooling and moral development</span>
				<span class='text'>The poet later paid tribute to him in a poem&lt;ref name=&quot;Satires 1</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;&gt;''Satires'' 1</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt; that one modern scholar considers the best memorial by any son to his father</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;&quot;No son ever set a finer monument to his father than Horace did in the sixth satire of Book I</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>orace's description of his father is warm-hearted but free from sentimentality or exaggeration</span>
				<span class='text'>We see before us one of the common people, a hard-working, open-minded, and thoroughly honest man of simple habits and strict convictions, representing some of the best qualities that at the end of the Republic could still be found in the unsophisticated society of the Italian ''municipia''&quot;{{emdash}}E</span>
				<span class='text'>Fraenkel, ''Horace'', 5–6&lt;/ref&gt; The poem includes this passage:&lt;blockquote&gt;If my character is flawed by a few minor faults, but is otherwise decent and moral, if you can point out only a few scattered blemishes on an otherwise immaculate surface, if no one can accuse me of greed, or of prurience, or of profligacy, if I live a virtuous life, free of defilement (pardon, for a moment, my self-praise), and if I am to my friends a good friend, my father deserves all the credit</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>As it is now, he deserves from me unstinting gratitude and praise</span>
				<span class='text'>I could never be ashamed of such a father, nor do I feel any need, as many people do, to apologize for being a freedman's son</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[Satire]]s 1</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>5–92''&lt;/blockquote&gt;He never mentioned his mother in his verses and he might not have known much about her</span>
				<span class='text'>Perhaps she also had been a slave</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Kiernan&quot;/&gt;===Adulthood===Horace left Rome, possibly after his father's death, and continued his formal education in Athens, a great centre of learning in the ancient world, where he arrived at nineteen years of age, enrolling in [[Platonic Academy|The Academy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Founded by [[Plato]], The Academy was now dominated by [[Epicureans]] and [[Stoics]], whose theories and practises made a deep impression on the young man from Venusia</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;V</span>
				<span class='text'>Kiernan, ''Horace: Poetics and Politics'', 25&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, he mixed and lounged about with the elite of Roman youth, such as Marcus, the idle son of [[Cicero]], and the Pompeius to whom he later addressed a poem</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Odes'' 2</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt; It was in Athens too that he probably acquired deep familiarity with the ancient tradition of Greek lyric poetry, at that time largely the preserve of grammarians and academic specialists (access to such material was easier in Athens than in Rome, where the public libraries had yet to be built by [[Asinius Pollio]] and Augustus)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;E</span>
				<span class='text'>Fraenkel, ''Horace'', 8–9&lt;/ref&gt;Rome's troubles following the assassination of [[Julius Caesar]] were soon to catch up with him</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Marcus Junius Brutus]] came to Athens seeking support for a republican cause</span>
				<span class='text'>Brutus was fêted around town in grand receptions and he made a point of attending academic lectures, all the while recruiting supporters among the impressionable young men studying there, including Horace</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;E</span>
				<span class='text'>Fraenkel, ''Horace'', 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; An educated young Roman could begin military service high in the ranks and Horace was made [[tribunus militum]] (one of six senior officers of a typical legion), a post usually reserved for men of  senatorial or equestrian rank and which seems to have inspired jealousy among his well-born confederates</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Satires'' 1</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nisbet&quot;&gt;R</span>
				<span class='text'>Nisbet, ''Horace: life and chronology'', 8&lt;/ref&gt; He learned the basics of military life while on the march, particularly in the wilds of northern Greece, whose rugged scenery became a backdrop to some of his later poems</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;V</span>
				<span class='text'>Kiernan, ''Horace'', 25&lt;/ref&gt; It was there in 42 BC that [[Octavian]] (later [[Augustus]]) and his associate [[Mark Antony]] crushed the republican forces at the [[Battle of Philippi]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Horace later recorded it as a day of embarrassment for himself, when he fled without his shield,&lt;ref&gt;''Odes'' 2</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>0&lt;/ref&gt; but allowance should be made for his self-deprecating humour</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, the incident allowed him to identify himself with some famous poets who had long ago abandoned their shields in battle, notably his heroes [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]] and [[Archilochus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The comparison with the latter poet is uncanny: Archilochus lost his shield in a part of Thrace near Philippi, and he was deeply involved in the Greek colonization of [[Thasos]], where Horace's die-hard comrades finally surrendered</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Nisbet&quot;/&gt;Octavian offered an early amnesty to his opponents and Horace quickly accepted it</span>
				<span class='text'>On returning to Italy, he was confronted with yet another loss: his father's estate in Venusia was one of many throughout Italy to be confiscated for the settlement of veterans ([[Virgil]] lost his estate in the north about the same time)</span>
				<span class='text'>Horace later claimed that he was reduced to poverty and this led him to try his hand at poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Epistles'' 2</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>1–2&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, there was no money to be had from versifying</span>
				<span class='text'>At best, it offered future prospects through contacts with other poets and their patrons among the rich</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;V</span>
				<span class='text'>Kiernan, ''Horace: Poetics and politics''&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, he obtained the sinecure of ''scriba quaestorius'', a civil service position at the ''aerarium'' or Treasury, profitable enough to be purchased even by members of the ''ordo equester'' and not very demanding in its work-load, since tasks could be delegated to ''scribae'' or permanent clerks</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;E</span>
				<span class='text'>Fraenkel, ''Horace'', 14–15&lt;/ref&gt; It was about this time that he began writing his ''Satires'' and ''Epodes''</span>
				<span class='text'>===Poet====[[File:Fedor Bronnikov 014</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Horace reads before Maecenas, by [[Fyodor Bronnikov]]]]The ''Epodes'' belong to the iambic genre of 'blame poetry', written to shame fellow citizens into a sense of their social obligations</span>
				<span class='text'>Horace modelled these poems on the work of Archilochus</span>
				<span class='text'>Social bonds in Rome had been decaying since the destruction of [[Carthage]] a little more than a hundred years earlier, due to the vast wealth that could be gained by plunder and corruption,&lt;ref&gt;D</span>
				<span class='text'>Mankin, ''Horace: Epodes'', 6&lt;/ref&gt; and the troubles were magnified by rivalry between Julius Caesar, Mark Antony and confederates like [[Sextus Pompey]], all jockeying for a bigger share of the spoils</span>
				<span class='text'>One modern scholar has counted a dozen civil wars in the hundred years leading up to 31 BC, including the [[Spartacus]] rebellion, eight years before Horace's birth</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;R</span>
				<span class='text'>Conway, ''New Studies of a Great Inheritance'', 49–50&lt;/ref&gt; As the heirs to Hellenistic culture, Horace and his fellow Romans were not well prepared to deal with these problems:{{Quotation|&quot;At bottom, all the problems that the times were stirring up were of a social nature, which the Hellenistic thinkers were ill qualified to grapple with</span>
				<span class='text'>Some of them censured oppression of the poor by the rich, but they gave no practical lead, though they may have hoped to see well-meaning rulers doing so</span>
				<span class='text'>Philosophy was drifting into absorption in self, a quest for private contentedness, to be achieved by self-control and restraint, without much regard for the fate of a disintegrating community</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{emdash}}V</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Kiernan&lt;ref&gt;V</span>
				<span class='text'>Kiernan, ''Horace: Poetics and Politics'', 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;}}Horace's Hellenistic background is clear in his Satires, even though the genre was unique to Latin literature</span>
				<span class='text'>He brought to it a style and outlook suited to the social and ethical issues confronting Rome but he changed its role from public, social engagement to private meditation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;F</span>
				<span class='text'>Muecke, ''The Satires'', 109–10&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, he was beginning to interest Octavian's supporters, a gradual process described by him in one of his satires</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Satires 1</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;/&gt; The way was opened for him by his friend, the poet Virgil, who had gained admission into the privileged circle around Maecenas, Octavian's lieutenant, following the success of his  ''[[Eclogues]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>An introduction soon followed and, after a discreet interval, Horace too was accepted</span>
				<span class='text'>He depicted the process as an honourable one, based on merit and mutual respect, eventually leading to true friendship, and there is reason to believe that his relationship was genuinely friendly, not just with Maecenas but afterwards with Augustus as well</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;R</span>
				<span class='text'>Lyne, ''Augustan Poetry and Society'', 599&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the poet has been unsympathetically described by one scholar as &quot;a sharp and rising young man, with an eye to the main chance</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;J</span>
				<span class='text'>Griffin, ''Horace in the Thirties'', 6&lt;/ref&gt; There were advantages on both sides: Horace gained encouragement and material support, the politicians gained a hold on a potential dissident</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;R</span>
				<span class='text'>Nisbet, ''Horace: life and chronology'', 10&lt;/ref&gt; His republican sympathies, and his role at Philippi, may have caused him some pangs of remorse over his new status</span>
				<span class='text'>However most Romans considered the civil wars to be the result of ''contentio dignitatis'', or rivalry between the foremost families of the city, and he too seems to have accepted the principate as Rome's last hope for much needed peace</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;D</span>
				<span class='text'>Mankin, ''Horace: Epodes'', 5&lt;/ref&gt;In 37 BC, Horace accompanied Maecenas on a journey to [[Brundisium]], described in one of his poems&lt;ref&gt;''Satires'' 1</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt; as a series of amusing incidents and charming encounters with other friends along the way, such as Virgil</span>
				<span class='text'>In fact the journey was political in its motivation, with Maecenas en route to negotiatie the [[Treaty of Tarentum]] with Antony, a fact Horace artfully keeps from the reader (political issues are largely avoided in the first book of satires)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; Horace was probably also with Maecenas on one of Octavian's naval expeditions against the piratical Sextus Pompeius, which ended in a disastrous storm off [[Palinurus]] in 36 BC, briefly alluded to by Horace in terms of near-drowning</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Odes'' 3</span>
				<span class='text'></span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>8: &quot;nec (me extinxit) Sicula Palinurus unda&quot;; &quot;nor did Palinurus extinguish me with Sicilian waters&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Maecenas' involvement is recorded by [[Appian]] ''Bell</span>
				<span class='text'>Civ</span>
				<span class='text'>' 5</span>
				<span class='text'>9 but Horace's ode is the only historical reference to his own presence there, depending however on interpretation</span>
				<span class='text'>(R</span>
				<span class='text'>Nisbet, ''Horace: life and chronology'', 10)&lt;/ref&gt; There are also some indications in his verses that he was with Maecenas at the [[Battle of Actium]] in 31 BC, where Octavian defeated his great rival, Antony</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Epodes'' 1 and 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;The point is much disputed among scholars and hinges on how the text is interpreted</span>
				<span class='text'>''Epodes'' 9 for example may offer proof of Horace's presence if 'ad hunc frementis' ('gnashing at this' man i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>the traitrous Roman ) is a misreading of 'at huc</span>
				<span class='text'></span>

				<span class='text'>Nisbet, ''Horace: life and chronology'', 12)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; By then Horace had already received from Maecenas the famous gift of his [[Horace's villa|Sabine farm]], probably not long after the publication of the first book of ''Satires''</span>
				<span class='text'>The gift, which included income from five tenants, may have ended his career at the Treasury, or at least allowed him to give it less time and energy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;E</span>
				<span class='text'>Fraenkel, ''Horace'', 15&lt;/ref&gt; It signalled his identification with the Octavian regime yet, in the second book of ''Satires'' that soon followed, he continued the apolitical stance of the first book</span>
				<span class='text'>By this time, he had attained the status of ''eques Romanus'',&lt;ref&gt;''Satires'' 2</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>3&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps as a result of his work at the Treasury</span>

				<span class='text'>, on the gravestone of Elliot Charles Bovill, Chief Justice of the [[Straits Settlements]], in [[Fort Canning|Fort Canning Green]], Singapore]]''Odes'' 1–3 were the next focus for his artistic creativity</span>
				<span class='text'>He adapted their forms and themes from Greek lyric poetry of the seventh and sixth centuries BC</span>
				<span class='text'>The fragmented nature of the Greek world had enabled his literary heroes to express themselves freely and his semi-retirement from the Treasury in Rome to his own estate in the Sabine hills perhaps empowered him to some extent also&lt;ref&gt;V</span>
				<span class='text'>Kiernan, ''Horace: Poetics and Politics'', 61–2&lt;/ref&gt; yet even when his lyrics touched on public affairs they reinforced the importance of private life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Nevertheless, his work in the period 30–27 BC began to show his closeness to the regime and his sensitivity to its developing ideology</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''Odes'' 1</span>
				<span class='text'>, for example, he eulogized Octavian in hyperboles that echo Hellenistic court poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>The name ''Augustus'', which Octavian assumed in January 27 BC, is first attested in ''Odes'' 3</span>
				<span class='text'> and 3</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>In the period 27–24 BC, political allusions in the ''Odes'' concentrated on foreign wars in Britain (1</span>
				<span class='text'>5), Arabia (1</span>
				<span class='text'>9) Spain (3</span>
				<span class='text'>) and Parthia (2</span>
				<span class='text'>)</span>
				<span class='text'>He greeted Augustus on his return to Rome in 24 BC as a beloved ruler upon whose good health he depended for his own happiness (3</span>
				<span class='text'>4)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;R</span>
				<span class='text'>Nisbet, ''Horace: life and chronology'', 13&lt;/ref&gt;The public reception of ''Odes'' 1–3 disappointed him however</span>
				<span class='text'>He attributed the lack of success to jealousy among imperial courtiers and to his isolation from literary cliques</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Epistles'' 1</span>
				<span class='text'>9</span>
				<span class='text'>5–44&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps it was disappointment that led him to put aside the genre in favour of verse letters</span>
				<span class='text'>He addressed his first book of ''Epistles'' to a variety of friends and acquaintances in an urbane style reflecting his new social status as a knight</span>
				<span class='text'>In the opening poem, he professed a deeper interest in moral philosophy than poetry&lt;ref&gt;''Epistles'' 1</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>0&lt;/ref&gt; but, though the collection demonstrates a leaning towards stoic theory, it reveals no sustained thinking about ethics</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;V</span>
				<span class='text'>Kiernan, ''Horace: Poetics and Politics'', 149, 153&lt;/ref&gt; Maecenas was still the dominant confidante but Horace had now begun to assert his own independence, suavely declining constant invitations to attend his patron</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Epistles'' 1</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt; In the final poem of the first book of ''Epistles'', he revealed himself to be forty-four years old in the consulship of Lollius and Lepidus i</span>

				<span class='text'>Nisbet, ''Horace: life and chronology'', 14–15&lt;/ref&gt;According to Suetonius, the second book of ''Epistles'' was  prompted by Augustus, who desired a verse epistle to be addressed to himself</span>
				<span class='text'>Augustus was in fact a prolific letter-writer and he once asked Horace to be his personal secretary</span>
				<span class='text'>Horace refused the secretarial role but complied with the emperor's request for a verse letter</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;E</span>
				<span class='text'>Fraenkel, ''Horace'', 17–18&lt;/ref&gt; The letter to Augustus may have been slow in coming, being published possibly as late as 11 BC</span>
				<span class='text'>It celebrated, among other things, the 15 BC military victories of his stepsons, Drusus and Tiberius, yet it and the following letter&lt;ref&gt;''Epistles'' 2</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt; were largely devoted to literary theory and criticism</span>
				<span class='text'>The literary theme was explored still further in ''Ars Poetica'', published separately but written in the form of an epistle and sometimes referred to as ''Epistles'' 2</span>
				<span class='text'> (possibly the last poem he ever wrote)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;R</span>
				<span class='text'>Ferri, ''The Epistles'', 121&lt;/ref&gt; He was also commissioned to write odes commemorating the victories of Drusus and Tiberius&lt;ref&gt;''Odes'' 4</span>

				<span class='text'>4&lt;/ref&gt; and one to be sung in a temple of Apollo for the [[Secular Games]], a long abandoned festival that Augustus revived in accordance with his policy of recreating ancient customs (''Carmen Saeculare'')</span>
				<span class='text'>uetonius recorded some gossip about Horace's sexual activities late in life, involving mirrors</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Suetonius signals that the report is based on rumours by employing the terms &quot;traditur</span>

				<span class='text'>The distinction has little relevance for Horace{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} however since his personal and literary experiences are implicated in each other</span>
				<span class='text'>''Satires'' 1</span>
				<span class='text'>, for example, recounts in detail a real trip Horace made with Virgil and some of his other literary friends, and which parallels a Satire by Lucilius, his predecessor</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;E</span>
				<span class='text'>Fraenkel, ''Horace'', 106–7&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike much Hellenistic-inspired literature, however, his poetry was not composed for a small coterie of admirers and fellow poets, nor does it rely on abstruse allusions for many of its effects</span>
				<span class='text'>Though elitist in its literary standards, it was written for a wide audience, as a public form of art</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;E</span>
				<span class='text'>Fraenkel, ''Horace'', 74&lt;/ref&gt; Ambivalence also characterizes his literary persona, since his presentation of himself as part of a small community of philosophically aware people, seeking true peace of mind while shunning vices like greed, was well adapted to Augustus's plans to reform public morality, corrupted by greed{{spaced ndash}}is personal plea for moderation was part of the emperor's grand message to the nation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;E</span>
				<span class='text'>Fraenkel, ''Horace'', 95–6&lt;/ref&gt;Horace generally followed the examples of poets established as classics in different genres, such as [[Archilochus]] in ''Epodes'', [[Lucilius]] in ''Satires'' and [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]] in the ''Odes'', later broadening his scope for the sake of variation and because his models weren't actually suited to the realities confronting him</span>
				<span class='text'>Archilochus and Alcaeus were aristocratic Greeks whose poetry had a social and religious function that was immediately intelligible to their audiences but which became a mere artifice or literary motif when transposed to Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the artifice of the ''Odes'' is also integral to their success, since they could now accommodate a wide range of emotional effects, and the blend of Greek and Roman elements adds a sense of detachment and universality</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;J</span>
				<span class='text'>Griffin, ''Gods and Religion'', 182&lt;/ref&gt; Horace proudly claimed to introduce into Latin the spirit and iambic poetry of Archilochus but (unlike Archilochus) without persecuting anyone (''Epistles'' 1</span>
				<span class='text'>9</span>
				<span class='text'>3–5)</span>
				<span class='text'>It was no idle boast</span>
				<span class='text'>His ''Epodes'' were modeled on the verses of the Greek poet, as 'blame poetry', yet he avoided targeting real [[scapegoat]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>Whereas Archilochus presented himself as a serious and vigorous opponent of wrong-doers, Horace aimed for comic effects and adopted the persona of a weak and ineffectual critic of his times (as symbolized for example in his surrender to the witch Canidia in the final epode)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;S</span>
				<span class='text'>Harrison, ''Lyric and Iambic'', 192&lt;/ref&gt; He also claimed to be the first to introduce into Latin the lyrical methods of Alcaeus (''Epistles'' 1</span>
				<span class='text'>9</span>
				<span class='text'>2–3) and he actually was the first Latin poet to make consistent use of Alcaic meters and themes: love, politics and the [[symposium]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He imitated other Greek lyric poets as well, employing a 'motto' technique, beginning each ode with some reference to a Greek original and then diverging from it</span>

				<span class='text'>Harrison, ''Lyric and Iambic'', 194–6&lt;/ref&gt;The satirical poet Lucilius was a senator's son who could castigate his peers with impunity</span>

				<span class='text'>Fraenkel, ''Horace'', 32, 80&lt;/ref&gt; Lucilius was a rugged patriot and a significant voice in Roman self-awareness, endearing himself to his countrymen by his blunt frankness and explicit politics</span>
				<span class='text'>His work expressed genuine freedom or [[libertas]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His style included  'metrical vandalism'  and looseness of structure</span>

				<span class='text'>Lucilius had composed a satire in the form of a letter, and some epistolary poems were composed by [[Catullus]] and [[Propertius]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Fraenkel, ''Horace'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>309&lt;/ref&gt; Such refinement of style was not unusual for Horace</span>
				<span class='text'>His craftsmanship as a wordsmith is apparent even in his earliest attempts at this or that kind of poetry, but his handling of each genre tended to improve over time as he adapted it to his own needs</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;E</span>
				<span class='text'>Fraenkel, Horace, 32, 80&quot;/&gt; Thus for example it is generally agreed that his second book of ''Satires'', where human folly is revealed through dialogue between characters, is superior to the first, where he propounds his ethics in monologues</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, the first book includes some of his most popular poems</span>

				<span class='text'>Kiernan, ''Horace: Poetics and Politics'', 28&lt;/ref&gt;===Themes===Horace developed a number of inter-related themes throughout his poetic career, including politics, love, philosophy and ethics, his own social role, as well as poetry itself</span>
				<span class='text'>His ''Epodes'' and ''Satires'' are forms of 'blame poetry' and both have a natural affinity with the moralising and diatribes of [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynicism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This often takes the form of allusions to the work and philosophy of [[Bion of Borysthenes]] &lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;There is one reference to Bion by name in ''Epistles'' 2</span>

				<span class='text'>0, and the clearest allusion to him is in ''Satire'' 1</span>
				<span class='text'>, which parallels Bion fragments 1, 2, 16 ''Kindstrand''&lt;/ref&gt; but it is as much a literary game as a philosophical alignment</span>
				<span class='text'>By the time he composed his ''Epistles'', he was a critic of Cynicism along with all impractical and &quot;high-falutin&quot; philosophy in general</span>

				<span class='text'>In it, Horace addresses the emperor Augustus directly with more confidence and proclaims his power to grant poetic immortality to those he praises</span>
				<span class='text'>It is the least philosophical collection of his verses, excepting the twelfth ode, addressed to the dead Virgil as if he were living</span>

				<span class='text'>179&lt;/ref&gt; The first poem of the ''Epistles'' sets the philosophical tone for the rest of the collection: &quot;So now I put aside both verses and all those other games: What is true and what befits is my care, this my question, this my whole concern</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; His poetic renunciation of poetry in favour of philosophy is intended to be ambiguous</span>
				<span class='text'>Ambiguity is the hallmark of the ''Epistles''</span>
				<span class='text'>It is uncertain if those being addressed by the self-mocking poet-philosopher are being honoured or criticized</span>
				<span class='text'>Though he emerges as an Epicurean, it is on the understanding that philosophical preferences, like political and social choices, are a matter of personal taste</span>

				<span class='text'>Tarrant, ''Ancient receptions of Horace'', 282–3&lt;/ref&gt;These preliminary comments touch on a small sample of developments in the reception of Horace's work</span>
				<span class='text'>More developments are covered epoch by epoch in the following sections</span>
				<span class='text'>==Antiquity===Horace's influence can be observed in the work of his near contemporaries, [[Ovid]] and [[Propertius]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Ovid followed his example in creating a completely natural style of expression in hexameter verse, and Propertius cheekily mimicked him in his third book of elegies</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Propertius published his third book of elegies within a year or two of Horace's Odes 1–3 and mimicked him, for example, in the opening lines, characterizing himself in terms borrowed from Odes 3</span>

				<span class='text'>3–14, as a priest of the Muses and as an adaptor of Greek forms of poetry (R</span>
				<span class='text'>Tarrant, ''Ancient receptions of Horace'', 227)&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Epistles'' provided them both with a model for their own verse letters and it also shaped Ovid's exile poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Ovid for example probably borrowed from Horace's ''Epistle'' 1</span>
				<span class='text'>0 the image of a poetry book as a slave boy eager to leave home, adapting it to the opening poems of ''Tristia'' 1 and 3 (R</span>
				<span class='text'>Tarrant, ''Ancient receptions of Horace''), and ''Tristia'' 2 may be understood as a counterpart to Horace's ''Epistles'' 2</span>
				<span class='text'>, both being letters addressed to Augustus on literary themes (A</span>
				<span class='text'>Barchiesi, ''Speaking Volumes'', 79–103)&lt;/ref&gt;His influence had a perverse aspect</span>
				<span class='text'>As mentioned before, the brilliance of his ''Odes'' may have discouraged imitation</span>
				<span class='text'>Conversely, they may have created a vogue for the lyrics of the archaic Greek poet [[Pindar]], due to the fact that Horace had neglected that style of lyric (see [[Pindar#Influence and legacy]])</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;R</span>
				<span class='text'>Tarrant, Ancient receptions of Horace, 280&lt;/ref&gt; The iambic genre seems almost to have disappeared after publication of Horace's ''Epodes''</span>
				<span class='text'>Ovid's ''Ibis'' was a rare attempt at the form but it was inspired mainly by [[Callimachus]], and there are some iambic elements in [[Martial]] but the main influence there was [[Catullus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;R</span>
				<span class='text'>Tarrant, ''Ancient receptions of Horace'', 278&lt;/ref&gt; A revival of popular interest in the satires of [[Lucillius]] may have been inspired by Horace's criticism of his unpolished style</span>
				<span class='text'>Both Horace and Lucilius were considered good role-models by [[Persius]], who critiqued his own satires as lacking both the acerbity of Lucillius and the gentler touch of Horace</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;The comment is in Persius 1</span>
				<span class='text'>14–18, yet that same satire has been found to have nearly 80 reminiscences of Horace; see D</span>
				<span class='text'>Hooley, ''The Knotted Thong'', 29&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juvenal]]'s caustic satire was influenced mainly by Lucilius but Horace by then was a school classic and Juvenal could refer to him respectfully and in a round-about way as &quot;''the Venusine lamp''&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;The allusion to ''Venusine'' comes via Horace's ''Sermones'' 2</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>5, while ''lamp'' signifies the lucubrations of a conscientious poet</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Quintillian (93), however, many people in Flavian Rome preferred Lucilius not only to Horace but to all other Latin poets (R</span>
				<span class='text'>Tarrant, ''Ancient receptions of Horace'', 279)&lt;/ref&gt;[[Statius]] paid homage to Horace by composing one poem in Sapphic and one in Alcaic meter (the verse forms most often associated with ''Odes''), which he included in his collection of occasional poems, ''Silvae''</span>
				<span class='text'>Ancient scholars wrote commentaries on the lyric meters of the ''Odes'', including the scholarly poet [[Caesius Bassus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>By a process called ''derivatio'', he varied established meters through the addition or omission of syllables, a technique borrowed by [[Seneca the Younger]] when adapting Horatian meters to the stage</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;R</span>
				<span class='text'>Tarrant, ''Ancient receptions of Horace'', 280–81&lt;/ref&gt;Horace's poems continued to be school texts into late antiquity</span>
				<span class='text'>Works attributed to [[Helenius Acro]] and [[Pomponius Porphyrio]] are the remnants of a much larger body of Horatian scholarship</span>
				<span class='text'>Porphyrio arranged the poems in non-chronological order, beginning with the ''Odes'', because of their general popularity and their appeal to scholars (the ''Odes'' were to retain this privileged position in the medieval manuscript tradition and thus in modern editions also)</span>
				<span class='text'>Horace was often evoked by poets of the fourth century, such as [[Ausonius]] and [[Claudian]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Prudentius]] presented himself as a Christian Horace, adapting Horatian meters to his own poetry and giving Horatian motifs a Christian tone</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Prudentius sometimes alludesto the ''Odes'' in a negative context, as expressions of a secular life he is abandoning</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus for example ''male pertinax'', employed in Prudentius's ''Praefatio'' to describe a wilful desire for victory, is lifted from ''Odes'' 1</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>4, where it describes a girl's half-hearted resistance to seduction</span>
				<span class='text'>Elsewhere he borrows ''dux bone'' from ''Odes'' 4</span>

				<span class='text'> and 37, where it refers to Augustus, and applies it to Christ (R</span>
				<span class='text'>Tarrant, ''Ancient receptions of Horace'', 282&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[St Jerome]], modelled an uncompromising response to the pagan Horace, observing: &quot;''What harmony can there be between Christ and the Devil? What has Horace to do with the Psalter?''&quot;&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;St Jerome, ''Epistles'' 22</span>

				<span class='text'>Friis-Jensen, ''Horace in the Middle Ages'', 292)&lt;/ref&gt; By the early sixth century, Horace and Prudentius were both part of a classical heritage that was struggling to survive the disorder of the times</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Boethius]], the last major author of classical Latin literature, could still take inspiration from Horace, sometimes mediated by Senecan tragedy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Tarrant&quot;&gt;R</span>
				<span class='text'>Tarrant, ''Ancient receptions of Horace'', 283&lt;/ref&gt; It can be argued that Horace's influence extended beyond poetry to dignify core themes and values of the early Christian era, such as self-sufficiency, inner contentment and courage</span>

				<span class='text'>]Classical texts almost ceased being copied in the period between the mid sixth century and the Middle Ages</span>
				<span class='text'>Horace's work probably survived in just two or three books imported into northern Europe from Italy</span>

				<span class='text'>Two of those six manuscripts are French in origin, one was produced in [[Alsace]], and the other three show Irish influence but were probably written in continental monasteries ([[Lombardy]] for example)</span>

				<span class='text'>His influence on the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] can be found in the poems of [[Heiric of Auxerre]]&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Heiric, like Prudentius, gave Horatian motifs a Christian context</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus the character Lydia in ''Odes'' 3</span>

				<span class='text'>Tarrant, ''Ancient receptions of Horace'', 287–88)&lt;/ref&gt; and in some manuscripts marked with [[neumes]], mysterious notations that may have been an aid to the memorization and discussion of his lyric meters</span>
				<span class='text'>''Ode'' [[:wikisource:la:Carmina (Horatius)/Liber IV/Carmen XI|4</span>
				<span class='text'>1]] is neumed with the melody of a hymn to John the Baptist, ''[[Ut queant laxis]]'', composed in [[Sapphic stanza]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>This hymn later became the basis of the [[solfege]] system (''Do, re, mi</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>'){{emdash}}an association with western music quite appropriate for a lyric poet like Horace, though the language of the hymn is mainly Prudentian</span>

				<span class='text'>Tarrant, ''Ancient receptions of Horace'', 288–89&lt;/ref&gt; Lyons&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Lyons, Horace's Odes and the Mystery of Do-Re-Mi&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the melody in question was linked with Horace's Ode well before Guido d'Arezzo fitted [[Ut queant laxis]] to it</span>
				<span class='text'> However, the melody is unlikely to be a survivor from classical times, although Ovid&lt;ref&gt;Tristia, 4</span>

				<span class='text'>9-50&lt;/ref&gt; testifies to Horace's use of the lyre while performing his Odes</span>
				<span class='text'>he German scholar, [[Ludwig Traube (palaeographer)|Ludwig Traube]], once dubbed the tenth and eleventh centuries ''The age of Horace'' (''aetas Horatiana''), and placed it between the ''aetas Vergiliana'' of the eighth and ninth centuries, and the ''aetas Ovidiana'' of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, a distinction supposed to reflect the dominant classical Latin influences of those times</span>
				<span class='text'>Such a distinction is over-schematized since Horace was a substantial influence in the ninth century as well</span>
				<span class='text'>Traube had focused too much on Horace's ''Satires''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;B</span>
				<span class='text'>Bischoff, ''Living with the satirists'', 83–95&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all of Horace's work found favor in the Medieval period</span>
				<span class='text'>In fact medieval scholars were also guilty of over-schematism, associating Horace's different genres with the different ages of man</span>
				<span class='text'>A twelfth century scholar encapsulated the theory: &quot;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>orace wrote four different kinds of poems on account of the four ages, the ''Odes'' for boys, the ''Ars Poetica'' for young men, the ''Satires'' for mature men, the ''Epistles'' for old and complete men</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;K</span>
				<span class='text'>Friis-Jensen,''Horace in the Middle Ages'', 291&lt;/ref&gt; It was even thought that Horace had composed his works in the  order in which they had been placed by ancient scholars</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;According to a medieval French commentary on the ''Satires'': &quot;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>irst he composed his lyrics, and in them, speaking to the young, as it were, he took as subject-matter love affairs and quarrels, banquets and drinking parties</span>
				<span class='text'>Next he wrote his ''Epodes'', and in them composed invectives against men of a more advanced and more dishonourable age</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>e next wrote his book about the ''Ars Poetica'', and in that instructed men of his own profession to write well</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>ater he added his book of ''Satires'', in which he reproved those who had fallen a prey to various kinds of vices</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally he finished his oeuvre with the ''Epistles'', and in them, following the method of a good farmer, he sowed the virtues where he had rooted out the vices</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; (cited by K</span>
				<span class='text'>Friis-Jensen, ''Horace in the Middle Ages'', 294–302)&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its naivety, the schematism involved an appreciation of Horace's works as a collection, the ''Ars Poetica'', ''Satires'' and ''Epistles'' appearing to find favour as well as the ''Odes''</span>
				<span class='text'>The later Middle Ages however gave special significance to ''Satires'' and ''Epistles'', being considered Horace's mature works</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Dante]] referred to Horace as ''Orazio satiro'', and he awarded him a privileged position in the first circle of Hell, with [[Homer]], Ovid and [[Lucan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;K</span>
				<span class='text'>Friis-Jensen, ''Horace in the Middle Ages'', 293, 304&lt;/ref&gt;Horace's popularity is revealed in the large number of quotes from all his works found in almost every genre of medieval literature, and also in the number of poets imitating him in [[Prosody (Latin)#Two rhythms|quantitative Latin meter]] </span>
				<span class='text'>The most prolific imitator of his ''Odes'' was the Bavarian monk, [[Metellus of Tegernsee]], who dedicated his work to the patron saint of [[Tegernsee Abbey]],  [[Quirinus of Tegernsee|St Quirinus]], around the year 1170</span>
				<span class='text'>He imitated all Horace's lyrical meters then followed these up with imitations of other meters used by Prudentius and Boethius, indicating that variety, as first modelled by Horace, was considered a fundamental aspect of the lyric genre</span>
				<span class='text'>The content of his poems however  was restricted to simple piety</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;K</span>
				<span class='text'>Friis-Jensen, ''Horace in the Middle Ages'', 296–8&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most successful imitators of ''Satires'' and ''Epistles'' was another Germanic author, calling himself [[Sextus Amarcius]], around 1100, who composed four books, the first two exemplifying vices, the second pair mainly virtues</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;K</span>
				<span class='text'>Friis-Jensen, ''Horace in the Middle Ages'', 302&lt;/ref&gt;[[Petrarch]] is a key figure in the imitation of Horace in accentual meters</span>
				<span class='text'>His verse letters in Latin were modelled on the ''Epistles'' and he wrote a letter to Horace in the form of an ode</span>
				<span class='text'>However he also borrowed from Horace when composing his Italian sonnets</span>
				<span class='text'>One modern scholar has speculated that authors who imitated Horace in accentual rhythms (including stressed Latin and vernacular languages) may have considered their work a natural sequel to Horace's metrical variety</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;K</span>
				<span class='text'>Friis-Jensen, ''Horace in the Middle Ages'', 299&lt;/ref&gt; In France, Horace and [[Pindar]] were the poetic models for a group of vernacular authors called the [[Pléiade]], including for example [[Pierre de Ronsard]] and [[Joachim du Bellay]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Montaigne]] made constant and inventive use of Horatian quotes</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Michael McGann, ''Horace in the Renaissance'', 306&lt;/ref&gt; The vernacular languages were dominant in Spain and Portugal in the sixteenth century, where Horace's influence is notable in the works of such authors as [[Garcilaso de la Vega (poet)|Garcilaso de la Vega]], [[Juan Boscán]] [[Sá de Miranda]], [[Antonio Ferreira]] and [[Fray Luis de León]], the latter for example writing odes on the Horatian theme ''beatus ille'' (''happy the man'')</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;E</span>
				<span class='text'>Rivers, ''Fray Luis de León: The Original Poems''&lt;/ref&gt; The sixteenth century in western Europe was also an age of translations (except in Germany, where Horace wasn't translated until well into the seventeenth century)</span>
				<span class='text'>The first English translator was [[Thomas Drant]], who placed translations of [[Jeremiah]] and Horace side by side in ''Medicinable Morall'', 1566</span>
				<span class='text'>That was also the year that the Scot [[George Buchanan]] paraphrased the [[Psalms]] in a Horatian setting</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Ben Jonson]] put Horace on the stage in 1601 in ''[[Poetaster]]'', along with other classical Latin authors, giving them all their own verses to speak in translation</span>
				<span class='text'>Horace's part evinces the independent spirit, moral earnestness and critical insight that many readers look for in his poems</span>

				<span class='text'>McGann, ''Horace in the Renaissance'', 306–7, 313–16&lt;/ref&gt;===Age of Enlightenment===During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, or the [[Age of Enlightenment]], neo-classical culture was pervasive</span>
				<span class='text'>English literature in the middle of that period has been dubbed [[Augustan literature|Augustan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It is not always easy to distinguish Horace's influence during those centuries (the mixing of influences is shown for example in one poet's pseudonym, ''Horace Juvenal'')</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;'Horace Juvenal' was author of ''Modern manners: a poem'', 1793&lt;/ref&gt; However a measure of his influence can be found in the diversity of the people interested in his works, both among readers and authors</span>

				<span class='text'>The poet [[James Thomson (poet)|James Thomson]] owned five editions of Horace's work and the physician [[James Douglas (physician)|James Douglas]] had five hundred books with Horace-related titles</span>

				<span class='text'>Talbot, ''A Horatian Pun in Paradise Lost'', 21–3&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Horace's lyrics could offer inspiration to libertines as well as moralists, and neo-Latin sometimes served as a kind of discrete veil for the risqué</span>

				<span class='text'>On the other hand, [[Andrew Marvell]] took inspiration from Horace's ''Odes'' 1</span>
				<span class='text'>7 to compose his English masterpiece [[Horatian Ode upon Cromwell's Return from Ireland]], in which subtly nuanced reflections on the execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] echo Horace's ambiguous response to the death of [[Cleopatra]] (Marvell's ode was suppressed in spite of its subtlety and only began to be widely published in 1776)</span>
