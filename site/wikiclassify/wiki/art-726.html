				<span class='text'>His theories addressed the relationship between [[power (philosophy)|power]] and [[knowledge]], and how they are used as a form of [[social control]] through societal institutions</span>
				<span class='text'>Though often cited as a [[post-structuralist]] and [[postmodernist]], Foucault rejected these labels, preferring to present his thought as a critical history of [[modernity]]</span>

				<span class='text'>After several years as a cultural diplomat abroad, he returned to France and published his first major book, ''[[Madness and Civilization|The History of Madness]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>After obtaining work between 1960 and 1966 at the [[Blaise Pascal University|University of Clermont-Ferrand]], he produced two more significant publications, ''[[The Birth of the Clinic]]'' and ''[[The Order of Things]]'', which displayed his increasing involvement with [[structuralism]], a theoretical movement in [[social anthropology]] from which he later distanced himself</span>
				<span class='text'>These first three histories exemplified a [[historiography|historiographical]] technique Foucault was developing called &quot;archaeology&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>rom 1966 to 1968, Foucault lectured at the [[University of Tunis]], [[Tunisia]], before returning to France, where he became head of the philosophy department at the new experimental university of [[Paris VIII]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1970 he was admitted to the [[Collège de France]], membership of which he retained until his death</span>
				<span class='text'>He also became active in a number of [[left-wing]] groups involved in anti-racist campaigns, anti-human rights abuses movements, and the struggle for penal reform</span>
				<span class='text'>He went on to publish ''[[The Archaeology of Knowledge]]'', ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'', and ''[[The History of Sexuality]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>In these books he developed  archaeological and genealogical methods which emphasized the role which power plays in the evolution of discourse in society</span>
				<span class='text'>Foucault died in Paris of neurological problems compounded by [[HIV/AIDS]]; he became the first public figure in France to die from the disease, and his partner [[Daniel Defert]] founded the [[AIDES]] charity in his memory</span>
				<span class='text'>=Early life=====Youth: 1926–1946===Paul-Michel Foucault was born on 15 October 1926 in the city of [[Poitiers]], west-central France, as the second of three children to a prosperous and [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] [[Upper middle class|upper-middle-class]] family</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnm|1a1=Macey|1y=1993|1p=3|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2p=39}}He had been named after his father, Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Paul Foucault, as was the family tradition, but his mother insisted on the addition of the double-barrelled &quot;Michel&quot;; referred to as &quot;Paul&quot; at school, throughout his life he always expressed a preference for &quot;Michel&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=5|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=1–2}}She was the daughter of prosperous surgeon Dr</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=5|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=1}} Paul Foucault eventually took over his father-in-law's medical practice, while his wife took charge of their large mid-19th-century house, Le Piroir, in the village of [[Vendeuvre-du-Poitou]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=5|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=2}} Together the couple had three children, a girl named Francine and two boys, Paul-Michel and Denys, all of whom shared the same fair hair and bright blue eyes</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=5|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=3}} The children were raised to be nominal [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]], attending mass at the Church of Saint-Porchair, and while Michel briefly became an [[altar boy]], none of the family were devout</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfnm|1a1=Macey|1y=1993|1p=4|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2p=39}} Describing himself as a &quot;juvenile delinquent&quot;, he claimed his father was a &quot;bully&quot; who would sternly punish him</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Miller|1993|p=39}} In 1930, Foucault began his schooling two years early at the local Lycée Henry-IV</span>
				<span class='text'>Here he undertook two years of elementary education before entering the main ''lycée'', where he stayed until 1936</span>
				<span class='text'>He then undertook his first four years of secondary education at the same establishment, excelling in French, Greek, Latin and history but doing poorly at arithmetic and mathematics</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Macey|1993|pp=8–9}} In 1939, the [[Second World War]] broke out and France was occupied by [[Nazi Germany]] until 1945; his parents opposed the occupation and the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]], but did not join the [[French Resistance|Resistance]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Macey|1993|p=7}} In 1940, Foucault's mother enrolled him in the Collège Saint-Stanislas, a strict Roman Catholic institution run by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Lonely, he described his years there as the &quot;ordeal&quot;, but excelled academically, particularly in philosophy, history and literature</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=6–7|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=10|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3pp=39–40|4a1=Smart|4y=2002|4p=19}} In 1942, he entered his final year, the ''terminale'', where he focused on the study of philosophy, earning his ''[[baccalauréat]]'' in 1943</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Macey|1993|p=10}}Returning to the local Lycée Henry-IV, he studied history and philosophy for a year,{{sfn|Macey|1993|p=13}} aided by a personal tutor, the philosopher Louis Girard</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=9|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=11}} Rejecting his father's wishes that he become a surgeon, in 1945 Foucault traveled to [[Paris]], where he enrolled in one of the country's most prestigious secondary schools, which was also known as the [[Lycée Henri-IV]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Here, he studied under the philosopher [[Jean Hyppolite]], an [[existentialism|existentialist]] and expert on the work of 19th-century German philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] who had devoted himself to uniting existentialist theories with the [[dialectics|dialectical theories]] of Hegel and [[Karl Marx]]</span>
				<span class='text'>These ideas influenced Foucault, who adopted Hyppolite's conviction that philosophy must be developed through a study of history</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=11, 14–21|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=15–17|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3pp=40–41}}===École Normale Supérieure: 1946–1951===Attaining excellent results, in autumn 1946 Foucault was admitted to the elite [[École Normale Supérieure]] (ENS); to gain entry, he undertook exams and an oral interrogation by [[Georges Canguilhem]] and Pierre-Maxime Schuhl</span>
				<span class='text'>Of the hundred students entering the ENS, Foucault was ranked fourth based on his entry results, and encountered the highly competitive nature of the institution</span>
				<span class='text'>Like most of his classmates, he was housed in the school's communal dormitories on the Parisian Rue d'Ulm</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=24–25|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=17–22|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3p=45}}He remained largely unpopular, spending much time alone, reading voraciously</span>
				<span class='text'> His fellow students noted his love of violence and the macabre; he decorated his bedroom with images of torture and war drawn during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] by Spanish artist [[Francisco Goya]], and on one occasion chased a classmate with a dagger</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=26|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2p=45}} Prone to [[self-harm]], in 1948 Foucault allegedly undertook a failed [[suicide]] attempt, for which his father sent him to see the psychiatrist [[Jean Delay]] at the Hôpital Sainte-Anne</span>
				<span class='text'>Obsessed with the idea of self-mutilation and suicide, Foucault attempted the latter several times in ensuing years, praising suicide in later writings</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=26|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=27–28|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3pp=54–55}} The ENS's doctor examined Foucault's state of mind, suggesting that his suicidal tendencies emerged from the distress surrounding his homosexuality, because same-sex sexual activity was socially taboo in France</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=26|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|3p=55}} At the time, Foucault engaged in homosexual activity with men whom he encountered in the underground Parisian gay scene, also indulging in drug use; according to biographer [[James Miller (academic)|James Miller]], he enjoyed the thrill and sense of danger that these activities offered him</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnm|1a1=Macey|1y=1993|1p=30|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2pp=55–56}}Although studying various subjects, Foucault's particular interest was soon drawn to philosophy, reading not only Hegel and Marx but also [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Edmund Husserl]] and most significantly, [[Martin Heidegger]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnm|1a1=Macey|1y=1993|1p=34|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2p=46}} He began reading the publications of philosopher [[Gaston Bachelard]], taking a particular interest in his work exploring the [[history of science]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnm|1a1=Macey|1y=1993|1p=35|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2pp=60–61}} In 1948, the philosopher [[Louis Althusser]] became a tutor at the ENS</span>
				<span class='text'>A [[Marxism|Marxist]], he proved to be an influence both on Foucault and a number of other students, encouraging them to join the [[French Communist Party]] (''Parti communiste français'' –  PCF)</span>
				<span class='text'>Foucault did so in 1950, but never became particularly active in its activities, and never adopted an orthodox Marxist viewpoint, refuting core Marxist tenets such as [[class struggle]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=32–36, 51–55|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=23–26, 37–40|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3p=57}} He soon became dissatisfied with the bigotry that he experienced within the party's ranks; he personally faced [[homophobia]] and was appalled by the [[anti-semitism]] exhibited during the [[Doctors' plot]] in the [[Soviet Union]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He left the Communist Party in 1953, but remained Althusser's friend and defender for the rest of his life</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=36–38|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=43–45|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3p=61}} Excused from [[national service]] on medical grounds, he decided to study for a doctorate at the [[Fondation Dosne-Thiers|Fondation Thiers]], focusing on the philosophy of psychology</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|175px|In the early 1950s, Foucault came under the influence of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, who remained a core influence on his work throughout his life</span>
				<span class='text'>]Over the following few years, Foucault embarked on a variety of research and teaching jobs</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Miller|1993|p=61}} From 1951 to 1955, he worked as a psychology instructor at the ENS at Althusser's invitation</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=61–62|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=47}} Many of his students liked his lecturing style</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Macey|1993|p=56}} Meanwhile, he continued working on his thesis, visiting the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]] every day to read the work of psychologists like [[Ivan Pavlov]], [[Jean Piaget]] and [[Karl Jaspers]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnm|1a1=Macey|1y=1993|1p=49|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2pp=61–62}} Undertaking research at the psychiatric institute of the Hôpital Sainte-Anne, he became an unofficial intern, studying the relationship between doctor and patient and aiding experiments in the [[Electroencephalography|electroencephalographic]] laboratory</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=41–49|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=56–58|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3p=62}} Foucault adopted many of the theories of the psychoanalyst [[Sigmund Freud]], undertaking psychoanalytical interpretation of his dreams and making friends undergo [[Rorschach test]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfnm|Eribon|1991|1pp=30, 43|Miller|1993|2pp=62–63}}Embracing the Parisian ''avant-garde'', Foucault entered into a romantic relationship with the [[serialism|serialist]] composer [[Jean Barraqué]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Together, they tried to produce their greatest work; heavily used recreational drugs and engaged in [[sado-masochism|sado-masochistic]] sexual activity</span>

				<span class='text'>Later describing Nietzsche's work as &quot;a revelation&quot;, he felt that reading the book deeply affected him, being a watershed moment in his life</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=52|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=50|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3pp=64–67}} Foucault subsequently experienced another groundbreaking self-revelation when watching a Parisian performance of [[Samuel Beckett]]'s new play, ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'', in 1953</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnm|1a1=Macey|1y=1993|1p=41|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2pp=64–65}}Interested in literature, Foucault was an avid reader of the philosopher [[Maurice Blanchot]]'s book reviews published in ''[[Nouvelle Revue Française]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Enamoured with Blanchot's literary style and critical theories, in later works he adopted Blanchot's technique of &quot;interviewing&quot; himself</span>

				<span class='text'>While the latter attempted to convert the work into an [[epic opera]], Foucault admired Broch's text for its portrayal of death as an affirmation of life</span>

				<span class='text'>{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=45–46|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=67–69|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3pp=76–77}} That same year, Foucault published his first book, ''Mental Illness and Personality'' (''Maladie mentale et personnalité''), in which he exhibited his influence from both Marxist and Heideggerian thought, covering a wide range of subject matter from the reflex psychology of Pavlov to the classic psychoanalysis of Freud</span>
				<span class='text'>Referencing the work of [[Sociology|sociologists]] and anthropologists such as [[Émile Durkheim]] and [[Margaret Mead]], he presented his theory that illness was culturally relative</span>

				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Miller|1993|pp=63}} It was largely critically ignored, receiving only one review at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Macey|1993|p=67}} Foucault grew to despise it, unsuccessfully attempting to prevent its republication and translation into English</span>

				<span class='text'>Foucault wanted an active journalistic role in the paper,  but this proved untenable, and he soon became disillusioned with ''Libération'', believing that it distorted the facts; he would not publish in it until 1980</span>
