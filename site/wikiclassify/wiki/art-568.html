				<span class='text'> He studied many fields while in school, including law and economics</span>
				<span class='text'> Later in life, he would recall being fascinated and stimulated by colour as a child</span>
				<span class='text'>His fascination with colour symbolism and psychology continued as he grew</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1889, he was part of an ethnographic research group which travelled to the [[Vologda]] region north of Moscow</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''Looks on the Past'', he relates that the houses and churches were decorated with such shimmering  colours that upon entering them, he felt that he was moving into a painting</span>
				<span class='text'>This experience, and his study of the region's folk art (particularly the use of bright colours on a dark background), was reflected in much of his early work</span>
				<span class='text'> A few years later he first likened painting to composing music in the manner for which he would become noted, writing, &quot;Colour is the keyboard, the eyes are the hammers, the soul is the piano with many strings</span>
				<span class='text'>The artist is the hand which plays, touching one key or another, to cause vibrations in the soul&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>That same year, before leaving Moscow, he saw an exhibit of paintings by [[Claude Monet|Monet]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was particularly taken with the impressionistic style of ''[[Haystacks (Monet)|Haystacks]]''; this, to him, had a powerful sense of colour almost independent of the objects themselves</span>
				<span class='text'>Later, he would write about this experience:{{quote|That it was a haystack the catalogue informed me</span>
				<span class='text'>I could not recognize it</span>
				<span class='text'>This non-recognition was painful to me</span>
				<span class='text'>I considered that the painter had no right to paint indistinctly</span>

				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} He was also spiritually influenced by [[Madame Blavatsky]] (1831–1891), the best-known exponent of [[theosophy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Theosophical theory postulates that creation is a geometrical progression, beginning with a single point</span>
				<span class='text'>The creative aspect of the form is expressed by a descending series of circles, triangles and squares</span>

				<span class='text'>]--&gt;Art school, usually considered difficult, was easy for Kandinsky</span>
				<span class='text'>It was during this time that he began to emerge as an art theorist as well as a painter</span>
				<span class='text'>The number of his existing paintings increased at the beginning of the 20th century; much remains of the landscapes and towns he painted, using broad swaths of colour and recognizable forms</span>
				<span class='text'>For the most part, however, Kandinsky's paintings did not feature any human figures; an exception is ''Sunday, Old Russia'' (1904), in which Kandinsky recreates a highly colourful (and fanciful) view of peasants and nobles in front of the walls of a town</span>
				<span class='text'>''Riding Couple'' (1907) depicts a man on horseback, holding a woman with tenderness and care as they ride past a Russian town with luminous walls across a river</span>
				<span class='text'>The horse is muted while the leaves in the trees, the town, and the reflections in the river glisten with spots of colour and brightness</span>
				<span class='text'>This work demonstrates the influence of [[pointillism]] in the way the depth of field is collapsed into a flat, luminescent surface</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Fauvism]] is also apparent in these early works</span>
				<span class='text'> Colours are used to express Kandinsky's experience of subject matter, not to describe objective nature</span>
				<span class='text'>erhaps the most important of his paintings from the first decade of the 1900s was ''The Blue Rider'' (1903), which shows a small cloaked figure on a speeding horse rushing through a rocky meadow</span>
				<span class='text'>The rider's cloak is medium blue, which casts a darker-blue shadow</span>
				<span class='text'>In the foreground are more amorphous blue shadows, the counterparts of the fall trees in the background</span>
				<span class='text'>The blue rider in the painting is prominent (but not clearly defined), and the horse has an unnatural gait (which Kandinsky must have known)</span>
				<span class='text'>Some art historians believe {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} that a second figure (perhaps a child) is being held by the rider, although this may be another shadow from the solitary rider</span>
				<span class='text'>This intentional disjunction, allowing viewers to participate in the creation of the artwork, became an increasingly conscious technique used by Kandinsky in subsequent years; it culminated in the abstract works of the 1911–1914 period</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''The Blue Rider'', Kandinsky shows the rider more as a series of colours than in specific detail</span>
				<span class='text'>This painting is not exceptional in that regard when compared with contemporary painters, but it shows the direction Kandinsky would take only a few years later</span>
				<span class='text'>rom 1906 to 1908 Kandinsky spent a great deal of time travelling across Europe (he was an associate of the [[Blue Rose (art group)|Blue Rose]] symbolist group of Moscow), until he settled in the small [[Bavaria]]n town of [[Murnau am Staffelsee|Murnau]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1908 he bought a copy of ''Thought-Forms'' by [[Annie Besant]] and [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1909 he joined the Theosophical Society</span>
				<span class='text'>''The Blue Mountain'' (1908–1909) was painted at this time, demonstrating his trend toward abstraction</span>
				<span class='text'>A mountain of blue is flanked by two broad trees, one yellow and one red</span>
				<span class='text'>A procession, with three riders and several others, crosses at the bottom</span>
				<span class='text'>The faces, clothing, and saddles of the riders are each a single colour, and neither they nor the walking figures display any real detail</span>
				<span class='text'>The flat planes and the contours also are indicative of Fauvist influence</span>
				<span class='text'>The broad use of colour in ''The Blue Mountain'' illustrates Kandinsky's inclination toward an art in which colour is presented independently of form, and which each colour is given equal attention</span>
				<span class='text'>The composition is more planar; the painting is divided into four sections: the sky, the red tree, the yellow tree and the blue mountain with the three riders</span>

				<span class='text'>Exhibited at the 1913 [[Armory Show]]</span>
				<span class='text'>]Kandinsky's paintings from this period are large, expressive coloured masses evaluated independently from forms and lines; these serve no longer to delimit them, but overlap freely to form paintings of extraordinary force</span>
				<span class='text'>Music was important to the birth of abstract art, since music is abstract by nature—it does not try to represent the exterior world, but expresses in an immediate way the inner feelings of the soul</span>
				<span class='text'>Kandinsky sometimes used musical terms to identify his works; he called his most spontaneous paintings &quot;improvisations&quot; and described more elaborate works as &quot;compositions</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;In addition to painting, Kandinsky was an art theorist; his influence on the history of Western art stems perhaps more from his theoretical works than from his paintings</span>
				<span class='text'>He helped found the [[Neue Künstlervereinigung München]] (Munich New Artists' Association), becoming its president in 1909</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the group could not integrate the radical approach of Kandinsky (and others) with conventional artistic concepts and the group dissolved in late 1911</span>
				<span class='text'>Kandinsky then formed a new group, the Blue Rider ([[Der Blaue Reiter]]) with like-minded artists such as [[August Macke]], [[Franz Marc]], [[Albert Bloch]], and [[Gabriele Münter]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The group released an almanac (''The Blue Rider Almanac'') and held two exhibits</span>
				<span class='text'>More of each were planned, but the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914 ended these plans and sent Kandinsky back to Russia via [[Switzerland]] and [[Sweden]]</span>
				<span class='text'>is writing in ''The Blue Rider Almanac'' and the treatise &quot;On the Spiritual In Art&quot; (which was released in 1910) were both a defence and promotion of abstract art and an affirmation that all forms of art were equally capable of reaching a level of spirituality</span>
				<span class='text'>He believed that colour could be used in a painting as something autonomous, apart from the visual description of an object or other form</span>
				<span class='text'>hese ideas had an almost-immediate international impact, particularly in the English-speaking world</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See Michael Paraskos, &quot;English Expressionism,&quot; MRes Thesis, University of Leeds, Leeds 1997, p103f&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1912, ''On the Spiritual In Art'' was reviewed by [[Michael Sadleir]] in the London-based ''Art News</span>
				<span class='text'>'&lt;ref&gt;Michael Sadleir, Review of Uber da Geistige an der Kunst by Wassily Kandinsky, in &quot;The Art News,&quot; 9 March 1912, p</span>
				<span class='text'>5&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in Kandinsky grew apace when Sadleir published an English translation of ''On the Spiritual In Art'' in 1914</span>
				<span class='text'>Extracts from the book were published that year in [[Percy Wyndham Lewis]]'s periodical ''[[BLAST (magazine)|Blast]],'' and [[Alfred Orage]]'s weekly cultural newspaper ''[[The New Age]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Kandinsky had received some notice earlier in Britain, however; in 1910, he participated in the Allied Artists' Exhibition (organised by [[Frank Rutter]]) at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This resulted in his work being singled out for praise in a review of that show by the artist [[Spencer Frederick Gore]] in ''The Art News''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Spencer Frederick Gore, &quot;The Allied Artists' Exhibition at the Royal Albert Hall (London)&quot;, in &quot;The Art News,&quot; 4 August 1910, p</span>
				<span class='text'>54&lt;/ref&gt;Sadleir's interest in Kandinsky also led to Kandinsky's first works entering a British art collection; Sadleir's father, [[Michael Sadler (educationist)|Michael Sadler]], acquired several woodprints and the abstract painting ''Fragment for Composition VII'' in 1913 following a visit by father and son to meet Kandinsky in Munich that year</span>

				<span class='text'>He painted little during this period, but devoted his time to artistic teaching, with a program based on form and colour analysis; he also helped organize the Institute of Artistic Culture in Moscow</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1916 he met Nina Andreievskaya, whom he married the following year</span>
				<span class='text'>His spiritual, expressionistic view of art was ultimately rejected by the radical members of the Institute as too individualistic and bourgeois</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1921, Kandinsky was invited to go to Germany to attend the [[Bauhaus]] of [[Weimar]] by its founder, architect [[Walter Gropius]]</span>
				<span class='text'>== Bauhaus (1922–1933) ===Kandinsky taught the basic design class for beginners and the course on advanced theory at the [[Bauhaus]]; he also conducted painting classes and a workshop in which he augmented his colour theory with new elements of form psychology</span>
				<span class='text'>The development of his works on forms study, particularly on points and line forms, led to the publication of his second theoretical book (''Point and Line to Plane'') in 1926</span>
				<span class='text'>His examinations of the effects of forces on straight lines, leading to the contrasting tones of curved and angled lines, coincided with the research of Gestalt psychologists, whose work was also discussed at the Bauhaus</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Kandinsky|last = Düchting|first = Hajo|publisher = Taschen|year = 2013|isbn = 978-3-8365-3146-7|location = |pages = 68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geometrical elements took on increasing importance in both his teaching and painting—particularly the circle, half-circle, the angle, straight lines and curves</span>
				<span class='text'>This period was intensely productive</span>
				<span class='text'>This freedom is characterised in his works by the treatment of planes rich in colours and gradations—as in ''Yellow – red – blue'' (1925), where Kandinsky illustrates his distance from the [[Constructivism (art)|constructivism]] and [[suprematism]] movements influential at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>he two-meter-wide ''Yellow – red – blue'' (1925) consists of several main forms: a vertical yellow rectangle, an inclined red cross and a large dark blue circle; a multitude of straight (or sinuous) black lines, circular arcs, monochromatic circles and scattered, coloured checkerboards contribute to its delicate complexity</span>
				<span class='text'>This simple visual identification of forms and the main coloured masses present on the canvas is only a first approach to the inner reality of the work, whose appreciation necessitates deeper observation—not only of forms and colours involved in the painting but their relationship, their absolute and relative positions on the canvas and their harmony</span>
				<span class='text'>andinsky was one of [[Die Blaue Vier]] (Blue Four), formed in 1923 with [[Paul Klee|Klee]], [[Lyonel Feininger|Feininger]] and [[Alexej von Jawlensky|von Jawlensky]], which lectured and exhibited in the United States in 1924</span>
				<span class='text'>Due to right-wing hostility, the Bauhaus left Weimar and settled in [[Dessau]] in 1925</span>
				<span class='text'>Following a Nazi smear campaign the Bauhaus left Dessau in 1932 for [[Berlin]], until its dissolution in July 1933</span>

				<span class='text'>du/cct/winter11/columbia_forum|website=Columbia College Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kandinsky drew upon the biblical stories of [[Noah's Ark]], [[Jonah]] and the whale, Christ's [[resurrection]], the [[four horsemen of the Apocalypse]] in the [[book of Revelation]], Russian folktales and the common mythological experiences of death and rebirth</span>
				<span class='text'>Never attempting to picture any one of these stories as a narrative, he used their veiled imagery as symbols of the archetypes of death–rebirth and destruction–creation he felt were imminent in the pre-[[World War I]] world</span>
				<span class='text'>s he stated in ''Concerning the Spiritual In Art'' (see below), Kandinsky felt that an authentic artist creating art from &quot;an internal necessity&quot; inhabits the tip of an upward-moving pyramid</span>
				<span class='text'>This progressing pyramid is penetrating and proceeding into the future</span>
				<span class='text'>What was odd or inconceivable yesterday is commonplace today; what is ''avant garde'' today (and understood only by the few) is common knowledge tomorrow</span>
				<span class='text'>The modern artist–prophet stands alone at the apex of the pyramid, making new discoveries and ushering in tomorrow's reality</span>
				<span class='text'>Kandinsky was aware of recent scientific developments and the advances of modern artists who had contributed to radically new ways of seeing and experiencing the world</span>
				<span class='text'>'Composition IV'' and later paintings are primarily concerned with evoking a spiritual resonance in viewer and artist</span>
				<span class='text'>As in his painting of the apocalypse by water (''Composition VI''), Kandinsky puts the viewer in the situation of experiencing these epic myths by translating them into contemporary terms (with a sense of desperation, flurry, urgency, and confusion)</span>
				<span class='text'>This spiritual communion of viewer-painting-artist/prophet may be described within the limits of words and images</span>
				<span class='text'>== Artistic and spiritual theorist ===[[File:Vassily Kandinsky, 1913 - Composition 6</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|230px|''Composition VI'' (1913)|alt=Rectangular, multicolored abstract painting]]As the ''[[Der Blaue Reiter]] Almanac'' essays and theorizing with composer [[Arnold Schoenberg]] indicate, Kandinsky also expressed the communion between artist and viewer as being available to both the senses and the mind ([[synesthesia]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Hearing tones and chords as he painted, Kandinsky theorized that (for example), yellow is the colour of middle [[C (musical note)|C]] on a brassy trumpet; black is the colour of closure, and the end of things; and that combinations of colours produce vibrational frequencies, akin to chords played on a piano</span>
				<span class='text'>Kandinsky also developed a theory of geometric figures and their relationships—claiming, for example, that the circle is the most peaceful shape and represents the human soul</span>
				<span class='text'>These theories are explained in ''Point and Line to Plane'' (see below)</span>
				<span class='text'>uring the studies Kandinsky made in preparation for ''Composition IV,'' he became exhausted while working on a painting and went for a walk</span>
				<span class='text'>While he was out, Gabriele Münter tidied his studio and inadvertently turned his canvas on its side</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon returning and seeing the canvas (but not yet recognizing it) Kandinsky fell to his knees and wept, saying it was the most beautiful painting he had ever seen</span>
				<span class='text'>He had been liberated from attachment to an object</span>
				<span class='text'>As when he first viewed Monet's ''[[Haystacks (Monet)|Haystacks]]'', the experience would change his life</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=October 2011}}In another episode with Münter during the Bavarian [[abstract expressionist]] years, Kandinsky was working on his ''Composition VI''</span>
				<span class='text'>From nearly six months of study and preparation, he had intended the work to evoke a flood, baptism, destruction, and rebirth simultaneously</span>
				<span class='text'>After outlining the work on a mural-sized wood panel, he became blocked and could not go on</span>
				<span class='text'>Münter told him that he was trapped in his intellect and not reaching the true subject of the picture</span>
				<span class='text'>She suggested he simply repeat the word ''uberflut'' (&quot;deluge&quot; or &quot;flood&quot;) and focus on its sound rather than its meaning</span>
				<span class='text'>Repeating this word like a mantra, Kandinsky painted and completed the monumental work in a three-day span</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=October 2011}}== Theoretical writings on art ==Kandinsky's analyses on forms and colours result not from simple, arbitrary idea-associations but from the painter's inner experience</span>
				<span class='text'>He spent years creating [[Abstract art|abstract]], sensorially rich paintings, working with form and colour, tirelessly observing his own paintings and those of other artists, noting their effects on his sense of colour</span>

				<span class='text'>5-11&lt;/ref&gt; This subjective experience is something that anyone can do—not scientific, objective observations but inner, subjective ones, what French philosopher [[Michel Henry]] calls  &quot;absolute subjectivity&quot; or the &quot;absolute [[phenomenological life]]&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>27&lt;/ref&gt;=== Concerning the spiritual in art ===Published in 1912, Kandinsky's text, ''Du Spirituel dans l’art'', defines three types of painting; ''impressions'', ''improvisations'' and ''compositions''</span>
				<span class='text'>While impressions are based on an external reality that serves as a starting point, improvisations and compositions depict images emergent from the unconscious, though ''composition'' is developed from a more formal point of view</span>

				<span class='text'>Gallimard, 1991, p</span>
				<span class='text'>143&lt;/ref&gt; He did not analyze them objectively, but from the point of view of their inner effect on the observer</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;A point is a small bit of colour put by the artist on the canvas</span>
				<span class='text'>It is neither a geometric point nor a mathematical abstraction; it is extension, form and colour</span>
				<span class='text'>This form can be a square, a triangle, a circle, a star or something more complex</span>
				<span class='text'>The point is the most concise form but, according to its placement on the basic plane, it will take a different tonality</span>
				<span class='text'>It can be isolated or  resonate with other points or lines</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', éd</span>
				<span class='text'>Gallimard, 1991, p</span>
				<span class='text'>25-63&lt;/ref&gt;A line is the product of a force which has been applied in a given direction: the force exerted on the pencil or paintbrush by the artist</span>
				<span class='text'>The produced linear forms may be of several types: a ''straight'' line, which results from a unique force applied in a single direction; an ''angular'' line, resulting from the alternation of two forces in different directions, or a ''curved'' (or ''wave-like'') line, produced by the effect of two forces acting simultaneously</span>
				<span class='text'>A ''plane'' may be obtained by condensation (from a line rotated around one of its ends)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', éd</span>
				<span class='text'>Gallimard, 1991, p</span>
				<span class='text'>67-71&lt;/ref&gt;The subjective effect produced by a line depends on its orientation: a ''horizontal'' line corresponds with the ground on which man rests and moves; it possesses a dark and cold affective tonality similar to black or blue</span>
				<span class='text'>A ''vertical'' line corresponds with height, and offers no support; it possesses a luminous, warm tonality close to white and yellow</span>
				<span class='text'>A ''diagonal'' possesses a more-or-less warm (or cold) tonality, according to its inclination toward the horizontal or the vertical</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', éd</span>
				<span class='text'>Gallimard, 1991, p</span>
				<span class='text'>69-70&lt;/ref&gt;A force which deploys itself, without obstacle, as the one which produces a straight line corresponds with ''lyricism''; several forces which confront (or annoy) each other form a ''drama''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', éd</span>
				<span class='text'>Gallimard, 1991, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>80-82&lt;/ref&gt; The ''angle'' formed by the angular line also has an inner sonority which is warm and close to yellow for an acute angle (a triangle), cold and similar to blue for an obtuse angle (a circle), and similar to red for a right angle (a square)</span>

				<span class='text'>Gallimard, 1991, p</span>
				<span class='text'>89&lt;/ref&gt;The basic plane is, in general, rectangular or square</span>
				<span class='text'>therefore, it is composed of horizontal and vertical lines which delimit it and define it as an autonomous entity which supports the painting, communicating its affective tonality</span>
				<span class='text'>This tonality is determined by the relative importance of horizontal and vertical lines: the horizontals giving a calm, cold tonality to the basic plane while the verticals impart a calm, warm tonality</span>

				<span class='text'>Gallimard, 1991, p</span>
				<span class='text'>143-145&lt;/ref&gt; The artist intuits the inner effect of the canvas format and dimensions, which he chooses according to the tonality he wants to give to his work</span>
				<span class='text'>Kandinsky considered the basic plane a living being, which the artist &quot;fertilizes&quot; and feels &quot;breathing&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Gallimard, 1991, p</span>
				<span class='text'>145-146&lt;/ref&gt;Each part of the basic plane possesses an affective colouration; this influences the tonality of the pictorial elements which will be drawn on it, and contributes to the richness of the composition resulting from their juxtaposition on the canvas</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''above'' of the basic plane corresponds with looseness and to lightness, while the ''below'' evokes condensation and heaviness</span>
				<span class='text'>The painter's job is to listen and know these effects to produce paintings which are not just the effect of a random process, but the fruit of authentic work and the result of an effort towards inner beauty</span>
