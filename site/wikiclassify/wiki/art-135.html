				<span class='text'>2&lt;/ref&gt;The high-profile acquisition paid immediate financial dividends for Galaxy long before Beckham joined the team</span>

				<span class='text'>The gate revenue peaked as well with 11,000 new season tickets holders and sold-out luxury suites (each one of the 42 inside the team's home ground, the [[StubHub Center|Home Depot Center]])</span>

				<span class='text'>4&lt;/ref&gt; Even the LA Galaxy owners [[Anschutz Entertainment Group]] (AEG) saw an immediate spike in business</span>
				<span class='text'>Involved on many business fronts worldwide, AEG was already leveraging its Beckham association in places such as China, where the company had been working aggressively in Shanghai and Beijing for years to receive clearance to build arenas and stadiums</span>

				<span class='text'>He made the cover of ''Sports Illustrated'', a few weeks earlier [[Adidas]] launched the extensive 13-part ad campaign &quot;Fútbol meets Football&quot; starring Beckham and NFL running back [[Reggie Bush]], and ''W'' magazine published a racy photo spread featuring David and wife Victoria photographed by [[Steven Klein (photographer)|Steven Klein]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Chelsea]], which was expected to be Beckham's American debut</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition to popularising soccer, Beckham's arrival was used as platform for entertainment industry endeavours</span>
				<span class='text'>Since both Beckham's and his wife's often overlapping careers were handled by 19 Entertainment, which is owned by [[Simon Fuller]], who in turn has a business relationship with the [[Creative Artists Agency]] (CAA), one of Hollywood's most powerful talent agencies, it was important also for CAA that the Beckhams made as big a splash as possible upon their arrival in the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>On 16 July, CAA had hosted a welcoming bash for David at its new eight-storey, $400&amp;nbsp;million headquarters in [[Century City]] with CAA employees reportedly instructed beforehand to line the staircase and clap for Beckham upon his arrival</span>

				<span class='text'>However, the proceedings on the field of play completely took a back seat to the Beckham spectacle, and despite the presence of worldwide football stars [[Andriy Shevchenko]], [[Didier Drogba]], [[Michael Ballack]], [[Frank Lampard]], and [[John Terry]], the US television cameras were firmly focused on Beckham who spent most of the match on the bench</span>

				<span class='text'>It was in Toronto on 5 August that the team got its first taste of what life would be like on the road with Beckham on the roster</span>
				<span class='text'>Due to security concerns, it was the first time the team flew on a charter for a road match, rather than flying commercial (MLS normally forbids charter flights for away matches, claiming they provide competitive advantage, but in this case they made an exception due to the frenzy created around Beckham and resulting security issues)</span>
				<span class='text'>Also, instead of the usual MLS-mandated modest hotels, LA Galaxy stayed at the five-star [[King Edward Hotel (Toronto)|Le Méridien King Edward]] in downtown Toronto (an expense paid for by the local Toronto promoter), while the glitz and glamour continued with the velvet rope, red carpet party at the Ultra Supper Club with Beckham as the centerpiece guest</span>
