				<span class='text'>7 Conversion to Christianity enabled Disraeli to contemplate a career in politics</span>
				<span class='text'>Britain in the early 19th century was not a greatly anti Semitic society and there had been  MPs from Jewish families since  in 1770</span>

				<span class='text'>In this he was backed by his party hungry for office and its emoluments after almost thirty years with only brief spells in government</span>
