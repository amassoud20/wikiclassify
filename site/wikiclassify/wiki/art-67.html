				<span class='text'>vg| signature_alt = Cursive signature in ink}}'''Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|sep=,|KG|PC|FRS}} (21 December 1804&amp;nbsp;– 19 April 1881) was a British politician and writer, who twice served as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]</span>
				<span class='text'> He played a central role in the creation of the modern [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], defining its policies and its broad outreach</span>
				<span class='text'>Disraeli is remembered for his influential voice in world affairs, his political battles with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] leader [[William Ewart Gladstone]], and his [[one-nation conservatism]] or &quot;Tory democracy&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He made the Conservatives the party most identified with the glory and power of the [[British Empire]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He is, {{as of|2016|alt=at 2016}},&lt;!--THIS IS BRITISH ENGLISH: DO NOT CHANGE TO AMERICANISM &quot;as of&quot;--&gt; the only British Prime Minister [[British Jews|of Jewish birth]]</span>
				<span class='text'>israeli was born in [[London]]</span>
				<span class='text'> His father left Judaism after a dispute at his synagogue; young Benjamin became an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] at the age of 12</span>
				<span class='text'> After several unsuccessful attempts, Disraeli entered the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in 1837</span>
				<span class='text'> In 1846 the Prime Minister, [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]] split the party over his proposal to repeal the [[Corn Laws]], which involved ending the tariff on imported grain</span>
				<span class='text'> Disraeli clashed with Peel in the Commons</span>
				<span class='text'> Disraeli became a major figure in the party</span>
				<span class='text'> When [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Lord Derby]], the party leader, thrice formed governments in the 1850s and 1860s, Disraeli served as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] and [[Leader of the House of Commons]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also forged a bitter rivalry with Gladstone of the Liberal Party</span>
				<span class='text'>pon Derby's retirement in 1868, Disraeli became Prime Minister briefly before losing that year's election</span>
				<span class='text'> He returned to opposition, before leading the party to a majority in the 1874 election</span>
				<span class='text'> He maintained a close friendship with [[Queen Victoria]], who in 1876 created him Earl of Beaconsfield</span>
				<span class='text'>Disraeli's second term was dominated by the [[Eastern Question]]—the slow decay of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the desire of other European powers, such as Russia, to gain at its expense</span>
				<span class='text'>Disraeli arranged for the British to purchase a major interest in the [[Suez Canal Company]] (in Ottoman-controlled Egypt)</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1878, faced with Russian victories against the Ottomans, he worked at the [[Congress of Berlin]] to maintain peace in the Balkans and made terms favourable to Britain which weakened Russia, its longstanding enemy</span>
				<span class='text'> This diplomatic victory over Russia established Disraeli as one of Europe's leading statesmen</span>
				<span class='text'>orld events thereafter moved against the Conservatives</span>
				<span class='text'> Controversial wars in [[Second Anglo-Afghan War|Afghanistan]] and [[Anglo-Zulu War|South Africa]] undermined his public support</span>
				<span class='text'>He angered British farmers by refusing to reinstitute the Corn Laws in response to poor harvests and cheap American grain</span>
				<span class='text'>With Gladstone conducting [[Midlothian campaign|a massive speaking campaign]], his Liberals bested Disraeli's Conservatives in [[United Kingdom general election, 1880|the 1880 election]]</span>
				<span class='text'> In his final months, Disraeli led the Conservatives in opposition</span>
				<span class='text'>He had throughout his career written novels, beginning in 1826, and he published his last completed novel, ''[[Endymion (Disraeli novel)|Endymion]]'', shortly before he died at the age of 76</span>

				<span class='text'>7&quot;/&gt;Conversion to Christianity enabled Disraeli to contemplate a career in politics</span>
				<span class='text'>Britain in the early 19th century was not a greatly anti-Semitic society, and there had been [[Member of Parliament#United Kingdom|Members of Parliament]] (MPs) from Jewish families since [[Sampson Eardley, 1st Baron Eardley|Samson Gideon]] in 1770</span>
				<span class='text'>But until 1858 MPs were required to take the oath of allegiance &quot;on the true faith of a Christian&quot;, necessitating at least nominal conversion</span>

				<span class='text'>10&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known whether Disraeli formed any ambition for a parliamentary career at the time of his baptism, but there is no doubt that he bitterly regretted his parents' decision not to send him to [[Winchester College]]</span>

				<span class='text'>p3 &quot;The Corn Laws&quot;], BBC Radio 4, 24 October 2013, 31:00 minutes&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}}The first months of 1846 were dominated by a battle in Parliament between the free traders and the protectionists over the repeal of the Corn Laws, with the latter rallying around Disraeli and [[Lord George Bentinck]]</span>
				<span class='text'> An alliance of free-trade Conservatives (the &quot;[[Peelites]]&quot;), Radicals, and Whigs carried repeal,&lt;ref&gt;Blake (1967), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>230–239&lt;/ref&gt; and the Conservative Party split: the Peelites moved towards the Whigs, while a &quot;new&quot; Conservative Party formed around the protectionists, led by Disraeli, Bentinck, and [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Lord Stanley]] (later Lord Derby)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Blake (1967), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>242–247&lt;/ref&gt;The split in the Tory party over the repeal of the Corn Laws had profound implications for Disraeli's political career: almost every Tory politician with experience of office followed Peel, leaving the rump bereft of leadership</span>
				<span class='text'> In Blake's words, &quot;[Disraeli] found himself almost the only figure on his side capable of putting up the oratorical display essential for a parliamentary leader</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Blake (1967), p</span>
				<span class='text'>247&quot;&gt;Blake (1967), p</span>
				<span class='text'>247&lt;/ref&gt; Looking on from the House of Lords, the [[George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll|Duke of Argyll]] wrote that Disraeli &quot;was like a [[subaltern]] in a great battle where every superior officer was killed or wounded&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Blake (1967), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>247–248&lt;/ref&gt; If the Tory Party could muster the electoral support necessary to form a government, then Disraeli now seemed to be guaranteed high office</span>
				<span class='text'> However, he would take office with a group of men who possessed little or no official experience, who had rarely felt moved to speak in the House of Commons, and who, as a group, remained hostile to Disraeli on a personal level</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Blake (1967), p</span>
				<span class='text'>260&lt;/ref&gt; In the event the matter was not put to the test, as the Tory split soon had the party out of office, not regaining power until 1852</span>

				<span class='text'>The Tories remained split and the Queen sent for [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]], the Whig leader</span>
				<span class='text'>In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1847|1847 general election]], Disraeli stood, successfully, for the [[Buckinghamshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Buckinghamshire]] constituency</span>

				<span class='text'>In that year's general election, [[Lionel de Rothschild]] had been returned for the [[City of London (UK Parliament constituency)|City of London]]</span>

				<span class='text'>258&lt;/ref&gt;Disraeli spoke in favour of the measure, arguing that Christianity was &quot;completed Judaism&quot;, and asking the House of Commons &quot;Where is your Christianity if you do not believe in their Judaism?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hansard, 3rd Series, xcv, 1321–1330, 16 December 1847</span>

				<span class='text'> Disraeli who had attended the Protectionists dinner at the Merchant Taylors Hall, joined Bentinck in speaking and voting for the bill, although his own speech was a standard one of toleration</span>
				<span class='text'>The measure was voted down</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Blake (1967), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>259–260&lt;/ref&gt;In the aftermath of the debate Bentinck resigned the leadership and was succeeded by [[Charles Manners, 6th Duke of Rutland|Lord Granby]]; Disraeli's own speech, thought by many of his own party to be blasphemous, ruled him out for the time being</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Blake (1967), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>261–262&lt;/ref&gt; While these intrigues played out, Disraeli was working with the Bentinck family to secure the necessary financing to purchase [[Hughenden Manor]], in [[Buckinghamshire]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The possession of a country house, and incumbency of a county constituency were regarded as essential for a Tory with ambitions to lead the party</span>
				<span class='text'>Disraeli and his wife alternated between Hughenden and several homes in London for the rest of their marriage</span>
				<span class='text'>The negotiations were complicated by Bentinck's sudden death on 21 September 1848, but Disraeli obtained a loan of £25,000 from Bentinck's brothers [[Lord Henry Bentinck]] and [[William Cavendish-Scott-Bentinck, 5th Duke of Portland|Lord Titchfield]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Blake (1967), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>251–254&lt;/ref&gt;Within a month of his appointment Granby resigned the leadership in the Commons, feeling himself inadequate to the post, and the party functioned without a leader in the Commons for the rest of the parliamentary session</span>
				<span class='text'>At the start of the next session, affairs were handled by a triumvirate of Granby, Disraeli, and [[John Charles Herries]]—indicative of the tension between Disraeli and the rest of the party, who needed his talents but mistrusted him</span>
				<span class='text'>This confused arrangement ended with Granby's resignation in 1851; Disraeli effectively ignored the two men regardless</span>

				<span class='text'> Palmerston did so within weeks of Parliament's reassembly on 4 February 1852, his followers combining with Disraeli's Tories to defeat the government on a Militia Bill, and Russell resigned</span>

				<span class='text'>Disraeli, his closest ally, was his second choice and accepted, though disclaiming any great knowledge in the financial field</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Blake (1967), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>322–323&lt;/ref&gt;Disraeli's task as Chancellor was to devise a budget which would satisfy the protectionist elements who supported the Tories, without uniting the free-traders against it</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Blake (1967), p</span>
				<span class='text'>328&lt;/ref&gt; His proposed budget, which he presented to the Commons on 3 December, lowered the taxes on malt and tea, provisions designed to appeal to the working class</span>
				<span class='text'>To make his budget revenue-neutral, as funds were needed to provide defences against the French, he doubled the house tax and continued the income tax</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;w321&quot;&gt;Weintraub, p</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Aldous, p</span>
				<span class='text'>67&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the budget did not contain protectionist features, the opposition was prepared to destroy it—and Disraeli's career as Chancellor—in part out of revenge for his actions against Peel in 1846</span>

				<span class='text'>346–347&lt;/ref&gt;===Opposition===With the fall of the government, Disraeli and the Conservatives returned to the opposition benches</span>
				<span class='text'>Disraeli would spend three-quarters of his 44-year parliamentary career in opposition</span>
				<span class='text'>Derby was reluctant to seek to unseat the government, fearing a repetition of the Who? Who? Ministry and knowing that despite his lieutenant's strengths, shared dislike of Disraeli was part of what had formed the governing coalition</span>
				<span class='text'>Disraeli, on the other hand, was anxious to return to office</span>
				<span class='text'> In the interim, Disraeli, as Conservative leader in the Commons, opposed the government on all major measures</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>212–213&lt;/ref&gt; The start of the [[Crimean War]] in 1854 caused a lull in party politics; Disraeli spoke patriotically in support</span>
				<span class='text'> The British military efforts were marked by bungling, and in 1855 a restive Parliament considered a resolution to establish a committee on the conduct of the war</span>
				<span class='text'> The Aberdeen government chose to make this a [[motion of confidence]]; Disraeli led the opposition to defeat the government, 305 to 148</span>
				<span class='text'>Aberdeen resigned, and the Queen sent for Derby, who to Disraeli's frustration refused to take office</span>
				<span class='text'> Palmerston was deemed essential to any Whig ministry, and he would not join any he did not head</span>

				<span class='text'>344–346&lt;/ref&gt;When [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|a rebellion]] broke out in India in 1857, Disraeli took a keen interest in affairs, having been a member of a [[select committee]] in 1852 which considered how best to rule the subcontinent, and had proposed eliminating the governing role of the [[British East India Company]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After peace was restored, and Palmerston in early 1858 brought in legislation for direct rule of India by the Crown, Disraeli opposed it</span>
				<span class='text'>Many Conservative MPs refused to follow him and the bill passed the Commons easily</span>

				<span class='text'> At the request of the French ambassador, Palmerston put forward amendments to the [[conspiracy to murder]] statute, proposing to make creating an [[bomb|infernal device]] a felony rather than a misdemeanour</span>

				<span class='text'> Less reticent were Palmerston, Gladstone (again Chancellor) and Russell, whose statements in support of the South contributed to years of hard feelings in the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Blake (1967), p</span>
				<span class='text'>429&lt;/ref&gt; In 1862, Disraeli met Prussian Count [[Otto von Bismarck]] for the first time and said of him, &quot;be careful about that man, he means what he says&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Weintraub, p</span>
				<span class='text'>395&lt;/ref&gt;The party truce ended in 1864, with Tories outraged over Palmerston's handling of the territorial dispute between the [[German Confederation]] and Denmark known as the [[Schleswig-Holstein Question]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Disraeli had little help from Derby, who was ill, but he united the party enough on a no-confidence vote to limit the government to a majority of 18—Tory defections and absentees kept Palmerston in office</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Weintraub, p</span>
				<span class='text'>405&lt;/ref&gt; Despite rumours about Palmerston's health as he passed his eightieth birthday, he remained personally popular, and the Liberals increased their margin in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1865|July 1865 general election]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In the wake of the poor election results, Derby predicted to Disraeli that neither of them would ever hold office again</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Weintraub, p</span>
				<span class='text'>411&lt;/ref&gt;Political plans were thrown into disarray by Palmerston's death on 18 October 1865</span>
				<span class='text'> Russell became Prime Minister again, with Gladstone clearly the Liberal Party's leader-in-waiting, and as Leader of the House Disraeli's direct opponent</span>
				<span class='text'>One of Russell's early priorities was a Reform Bill, but the proposed legislation that Gladstone announced on 12 March 1866 divided his party</span>
				<span class='text'>The Conservatives and the [[Adullamites|dissident Liberals]] repeatedly attacked Gladstone's bill, and in June finally defeated the government; Russell resigned on 26 June</span>
				<span class='text'>The dissidents were unwilling to serve under Disraeli in the House of Commons, and Derby formed a third Conservative minority government, with Disraeli again as Chancellor</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Blake (1967), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>436–445&lt;/ref&gt; In 1867, the Conservatives introduced a Reform Bill</span>
				<span class='text'> Without a majority in the Commons, the Conservatives had little choice but to accept amendments that considerably liberalised the legislation, though Disraeli refused to accept any from Gladstone</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Aldous, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>174, 179, 182–184&lt;/ref&gt;The [[Reform Act 1867]] passed that August,&lt;ref&gt;Kirsch, p</span>
				<span class='text'>184&lt;/ref&gt; extending the franchise by 938,427—an increase of 88%—by giving the vote to male householders and male lodgers paying at least £10 for rooms</span>
				<span class='text'>It eliminated [[rotten borough]]s with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants, and granted constituencies to 15 unrepresented towns, with extra representation to large municipalities such as Liverpool and Manchester</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Conacher (1971), p</span>
				<span class='text'>179&lt;/ref&gt; This act was unpopular with the right wing of the Conservative Party, most notably [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Cranborne]] (as Robert Cecil was by then known), who resigned from the government and spoke against the bill, accusing Disraeli of &quot;a political betrayal which has no parallel in our Parliamentary annals&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Blake (1967), p</span>
				<span class='text'>473&lt;/ref&gt; Cranborne, however, was unable to lead an effective rebellion against Derby and Disraeli</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Blake (1967), p</span>
				<span class='text'>461</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Disraeli gained wide acclaim and became a hero to his party for the &quot;marvellous parliamentary skill&quot; with which he secured the passage of Reform in the Commons</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p</span>
				<span class='text'>259&lt;/ref&gt;Derby had long suffered from attacks of [[gout]] which sent him to his bed, unable to deal with politics</span>
				<span class='text'>As the new session of Parliament approached in February 1868, he was bedridden at his home, [[Knowsley Hall]], near Liverpool</span>
				<span class='text'> He was reluctant to resign, reasoning that he was only 68, much younger than either Palmerston or Russell at the end of their premierships</span>
				<span class='text'>Derby knew that his &quot;attacks of illness would, at no distant period, incapacitate me from the discharge of my public duties&quot;; doctors had warned him that his health required his resignation from office</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Aldous, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>187–188&lt;/ref&gt; In late February, with Parliament in session and Derby absent, he wrote to Disraeli asking for confirmation that &quot;you will not shrink from the additional heavy responsibility&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;a188&quot;&gt;Aldous, p</span>
				<span class='text'>188&lt;/ref&gt; Reassured, he wrote to the Queen, resigning and recommending Disraeli as &quot;only he could command the cordial support, en masse, of his present colleagues&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Disraeli's term as Prime Minister, which began in February 1868, would therefore be short unless the Conservatives won the general election</span>
				<span class='text'>He made only two major changes in the cabinet: he replaced [[Frederic Thesiger, 1st Baron Chelmsford|Lord Chelmsford]] as [[Lord Chancellor]] with [[Hugh Cairns, 1st Earl Cairns|Lord Cairns]], and brought in [[George Ward Hunt]] as Chancellor of the Exchequer</span>
				<span class='text'>Derby had intended to replace Chelmsford once a vacancy in a suitable sinecure developed</span>
				<span class='text'>Disraeli was unwilling to wait, and Cairns, in his view, was a far stronger minister</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Blake (1967), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>487–489&lt;/ref&gt;Disraeli's first premiership was dominated by the heated debate over the [[Church of Ireland]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Ireland was overwhelmingly Roman Catholic, the Protestant Church remained the [[established church]] and was funded by direct taxation, which was greatly resented by the Catholic majority</span>
				<span class='text'>An initial attempt by Disraeli to negotiate with [[Henry Edward Manning|Archbishop Manning]] the establishment of a Roman Catholic university in [[Dublin]] foundered in March when Gladstone moved resolutions to disestablish the Irish Church altogether</span>
				<span class='text'>The proposal united the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]] under Gladstone's leadership, while causing divisions among the Conservatives</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Blake (1967), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>496–499&lt;/ref&gt;The Conservatives remained in office because the new electoral register was not yet ready; neither party wished a poll under the old roll</span>
				<span class='text'>Gladstone began using the Liberal majority in the House of Commons to push through resolutions and legislation</span>
				<span class='text'>Disraeli's government survived until the [[United Kingdom general election, 1868|December general election]], at which the Liberals were returned to power with a majority of about 110</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Blake (1967), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>496–512&lt;/ref&gt;Despite its short life, the first Disraeli government succeeded in passing a number of pieces of legislation of a politically noncontentious sort</span>
				<span class='text'>It ended public executions, and the [[Corrupt Practices Act 1868|Corrupt Practices Act]] did much to end electoral bribery</span>
				<span class='text'>It authorised an early version of [[nationalisation]], having the Post Office buy up the telegraph companies</span>

				<span class='text'> Accordingly, he chose to await Liberal mistakes</span>
				<span class='text'> Having leisure time as he was not in office, he wrote a new novel, ''[[Lothair (novel)|Lothair]]'' (1870)</span>
				<span class='text'> A work of fiction by a former Prime Minister was a new thing for Britain, and the book became a best seller</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Aldous, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>210–211&lt;/ref&gt;By 1872 there was dissent in the Conservative ranks over the failure to challenge Gladstone and his Liberals</span>
				<span class='text'> This was quieted as Disraeli took steps to assert his leadership of the party, and as divisions among the Liberals became clear</span>
				<span class='text'> Public support for Disraeli was shown by cheering at a thanksgiving service in 1872 on the recovery of [[Edward VII|the Prince of Wales]] from illness, while Gladstone was met with silence</span>
				<span class='text'> Disraeli had supported the efforts of party manager [[John Eldon Gorst]] to put the administration of the Conservative Party on a modern basis</span>
				<span class='text'>On Gorst's advice, Disraeli gave a speech to a mass meeting in Manchester that year</span>
				<span class='text'> To roaring approval, he compared the Liberal front bench to &quot;a range of exhausted volcanoes</span>
				<span class='text'> Not a flame flickers on a single pallid crest</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Aldous, p</span>
				<span class='text'>223&lt;/ref&gt;At his first departure from [[10 Downing Street]] in 1868, Disraeli had had Victoria create Mary Anne Viscountess of Beaconsfield in her own right in lieu of a peerage for himself</span>

				<span class='text'>279–280&lt;/ref&gt; Through 1872 the eighty-year-old peeress was suffering from stomach cancer</span>

				<span class='text'>225; and Blake (1967), pp</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Aldous, p</span>
				<span class='text'>226&lt;/ref&gt;In 1873 Gladstone brought forward legislation to establish a Catholic university in Dublin</span>
				<span class='text'> This divided the Liberals, and on 12 March an alliance of Conservatives and Irish Catholics defeated the government by three votes</span>
				<span class='text'> Gladstone resigned, and the Queen sent for Disraeli, who refused to take office</span>
				<span class='text'> Without a general election, a Conservative government would be another minority, dependent for survival on the division of its opponents</span>
				<span class='text'> Disraeli wanted the power a majority would bring, and felt he could gain it later by leaving the Liberals in office now</span>
				<span class='text'> Gladstone's government struggled on, beset by scandal and unimproved by a reshuffle</span>
				<span class='text'>As part of that change, Gladstone took on the office of Chancellor,{{refn|Gladstone caused great surprise by this move; he transferred the incumbent Chancellor, Robert Lowe, to the Home Office</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Weintraub, p</span>

				<span class='text'>As the constituencies voted, it became clear that the result would be a Conservative majority, the first since 1841</span>
				<span class='text'> In Scotland, where the Conservatives were perennially weak, they increased from seven seats to nineteen</span>

				<span class='text'>|[[Edward Stanley, 15th Earl of Derby|Derby]] (top) and [[Stafford Northcote, 1st Earl of Iddesleigh|Northcote]]|alt=Two gentlemen; the second has an impressive beard]]Disraeli's cabinet of twelve, with six peers and six commoners, was the smallest since [[Reform Act 1832|Reform]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Of the peers, five of them had been in Disraeli's 1868 cabinet; the sixth, Lord Salisbury, was reconciled to Disraeli after negotiation and became [[Secretary of State for India]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Lord Stanley (who had succeeded his father, the former Prime Minister, as Earl of Derby) became Foreign Secretary and [[Stafford Northcote, 1st Earl of Iddesleigh|Sir Stafford Northcote]] the Chancellor</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Blake (1967), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>489, 538–540&lt;/ref&gt;In August 1876, Disraeli was elevated to the House of Lords as [[Earl of Beaconsfield]] and Viscount Hughenden</span>
				<span class='text'> The Queen had offered to ennoble him as early as 1868; he had then declined</span>
				<span class='text'> She did so again in 1874, when he fell ill at [[Balmoral Castle|Balmoral]], but he was reluctant to leave the Commons for a house in which he had no experience</span>
				<span class='text'> Continued ill health during his second premiership caused him to contemplate resignation, but his lieutenant, Derby, was unwilling, feeling that he could not manage the Queen</span>
				<span class='text'> For Disraeli, the Lords, where the debate was less intense, was the alternative to resignation from office</span>
				<span class='text'> Five days before the end of the 1876 session of Parliament, on 11 August, Disraeli was seen to linger and look around the chamber before departing the Commons</span>
				<span class='text'> Newspapers reported his ennoblement the following morning</span>

				<span class='text'>569&lt;/ref&gt;===Domestic policy=======Reforming legislation====Under the stewardship of [[Richard Assheton Cross]], the [[Home Secretary]], Disraeli's new government enacted many reforms, including the [[Artisans' and Labourers' Dwellings Improvement Act 1875]],&lt;ref name = &quot;mb709&quot; /&gt; which made inexpensive loans available to towns and cities to construct working-class housing</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;mb709&quot;  /&gt;Disraeli's government also introduced a new [[Factory Act]] meant to protect workers, the [[Conspiracy, and Protection of Property Act 1875]], which allowed peaceful picketing, and the Employers and Workmen Act (1875) to enable workers to sue employers in the civil courts if they broke legal contracts</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result of these social reforms the [[Liberal-Labour (UK)|Liberal-Labour]] MP [[Alexander Macdonald (Lib–Lab politician)|Alexander Macdonald]] told his constituents in 1879, &quot;The Conservative party have done more for the working classes in five years than the Liberals have in fifty</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|Disraeli's failure to appoint [[Samuel Wilberforce]] as [[Bishop of London]] may have cost him votes in the 1868 election</span>
				<span class='text'>]Gladstone in 1870 had sponsored an [[Order in Council]], introducing [[competitive examination]] into [[Her Majesty's Civil Service|the Civil Service]], diminishing the political aspects of government hiring</span>
				<span class='text'> Disraeli did not agree, and while he did not seek to reverse the order, his actions often frustrated its intent</span>
				<span class='text'> For example, Disraeli made political appointments to positions previously given to career civil servants</span>
				<span class='text'>In this, he was backed by his party, hungry for office and its emoluments after almost thirty years with only brief spells in government</span>
				<span class='text'>Disraeli gave positions to hard-up Conservative leaders, even—to Gladstone's outrage—creating one office at £2,000 per year</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Blake (1967), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>682–685&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Disraeli made fewer peers (only 22, and one of those one of Victoria's sons) than had Gladstone—the Liberal leader had arranged for the bestowal of 37 peerages during his just over five years in office</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Blake (1967), p</span>
				<span class='text'>687&lt;/ref&gt;As he had in government posts, Disraeli rewarded old friends with clerical positions, making [[Sydney Turner]], son of a good friend of Isaac D'Israeli, [[Dean of Ripon]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Blake (1967), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>686–687&lt;/ref&gt; He favoured [[Low church]] clergymen in promotion, disliking other movements in Anglicanism for political reasons</span>
				<span class='text'> In this, he came into disagreement with the Queen, who out of loyalty to her late husband, [[Albert, Prince Consort]], preferred [[Broad church]] teachings</span>
				<span class='text'>One controversial appointment had occurred shortly before the [[United Kingdom general election, 1868|1868 election]]</span>
				<span class='text'> When the position of [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] fell vacant, Disraeli reluctantly agreed to the Queen's preferred candidate, [[Archibald Tait]], the [[Bishop of London]]</span>
				<span class='text'> To fill Tait's vacant see, Disraeli was urged by many people to appoint [[Samuel Wilberforce]], the former [[Bishop of Winchester]] and leading figure in London society</span>
				<span class='text'> Disraeli disliked Wilberforce and instead appointed [[John Jackson (bishop)|John Jackson]], the [[Bishop of Lincoln]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Blake suggested that, on balance, these appointments cost Disraeli more votes than they gained him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Blake (1967), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>509–511&lt;/ref&gt;===Foreign policy===Disraeli always considered foreign affairs to be the most critical and most interesting part of statesmanship</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, his biographer Robert Blake doubts that his subject had specific ideas about foreign policy when he took office in 1874</span>
				<span class='text'> He had rarely travelled abroad; since his youthful tour of the Middle East in 1830–1831, he had left Britain only for his honeymoon and three visits to Paris, the last of which was in 1856</span>
				<span class='text'>As he had criticised Gladstone for a do-nothing foreign policy, he most probably contemplated what actions would reassert Britain's place in Europe</span>
				<span class='text'> His brief first premiership, and the first year of his second, gave him little opportunity to make his mark in foreign affairs</span>

				<span class='text'> Built by French interests, much of the ownership and bonds in the canal remained in their hands, though some of the stock belonged to [[Isma'il Pasha]], the [[Khedive of Egypt]], who was noted for his profligate spending</span>
				<span class='text'> The canal was losing money, and an attempt by [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]], builder of the canal, to raise the tolls had fallen through when the Khedive had threatened to use military force to prevent it, and had also attracted Disraeli's attention</span>

				<span class='text'>570–571&quot;/&gt; The Khedive governed Egypt under the Ottoman Empire; as in the Crimea, the issue of the Canal raised the [[Eastern Question]] of what to do about the decaying empire governed from [[Constantinople]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;w541&quot;&gt;Weintraub, p</span>
				<span class='text'>541&lt;/ref&gt; With much of the pre-canal trade and communications between Britain and India passing through the Ottoman Empire, Britain had done its best to prop up the Ottomans against the threat that Russia would take Constantinople, cutting those communications, and giving Russian ships unfettered access to the Mediterranean</span>
				<span class='text'>The French might also threaten those lines from colonies in Syria</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Roberts, pp</span>

				<span class='text'> Over time, her dislike softened, especially as Disraeli took pains to cultivate her</span>
				<span class='text'> He told [[Matthew Arnold]], &quot;Everybody likes flattery; and, when you come to royalty, you should lay it on with a trowel&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kirsch, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>202, 205&lt;/ref&gt; Disraeli's biographer, [[Adam Kirsch]], suggests that Disraeli's obsequious treatment of his queen was part flattery, part belief that this was how a queen should be addressed by a loyal subject, and part awe that a middle-class man of Jewish birth should be the companion of a monarch</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kirsch, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>203–205&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of his second premiership, Disraeli had built a strong relationship with Victoria, probably closer to her than any of her Prime Ministers except her first, [[Lord Melbourne]]</span>
				<span class='text'> When Disraeli returned as Prime Minister in 1874 and went to [[kiss hands]], he did so literally, on one knee, and according to Richard Aldous on his book on the Disraeli/Gladstone rivalry, &quot;for the next six years Victoria and Disraeli would exploit their closeness for mutual advantage</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Aldous, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>246–247&lt;/ref&gt;Victoria had long wished to have an imperial title, reflecting Britain's expanding domain</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Weintraub, p</span>
				<span class='text'>548&lt;/ref&gt;  She was irked when Czar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] held a higher rank than her as an emperor, and was appalled that her daughter, the Prussian Crown Princess, would outrank her when [[Frederick III, German Emperor|her husband]] came to the throne</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Aldous, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>263–264&lt;/ref&gt; She also saw an imperial title as proclaiming Britain's increased stature in the world</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Weintraub, p</span>
				<span class='text'>549&lt;/ref&gt; The title &quot;[[Empress of India]]&quot; had been used informally with respect to Victoria for some time and she wished to have that title formally bestowed on her</span>
				<span class='text'>The Queen prevailed upon Disraeli to introduce a Royal Titles Bill, and also told of her intent to [[State Opening of Parliament|open Parliament]] in person, which during this time she did only when she wanted something from legislators</span>
				<span class='text'>Disraeli was cautious in response, as careful soundings of MPs brought a negative reaction, and declined to place such a proposal in the [[Queen's Speech]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Weintraub, p</span>
				<span class='text'>551&lt;/ref&gt;Once the desired bill was prepared, Disraeli's handling of it was not adept</span>
				<span class='text'>He neglected to notify either the Prince of Wales or the opposition, and was met by irritation from the prince and a full-scale attack from the Liberals</span>
				<span class='text'>An old enemy of Disraeli, former Liberal Chancellor [[Robert Lowe]], alleged during the debate in the Commons that two previous Prime Ministers had refused to introduce such legislation for the Queen</span>
				<span class='text'> Gladstone immediately stated that he was not one of them, and the Queen gave Disraeli leave to quote her saying she had never approached a Prime Minister with such a proposal</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Blake, Disraeli &quot;in a brilliant oration of withering invective proceeded to destroy Lowe&quot;, who apologised and never held office again</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Blake (1967), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>563–564&lt;/ref&gt; Disraeli said of Lowe that he was the only person in London with whom he would not shake hands and, &quot;he is in the mud and there I leave him</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Blake (1967), p</span>
				<span class='text'>564&lt;/ref&gt;Fearful of losing, Disraeli was reluctant to bring the bill to a vote in the Commons, but when he eventually did, it passed with a majority of 75</span>
				<span class='text'>Once the bill was formally enacted, Victoria began signing her letters &quot;Victoria R &amp; I&quot; (''Regina et Imperatrix'', that is, Queen and Empress)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Weintraub, p</span>
				<span class='text'>553&lt;/ref&gt; According to Aldous, &quot;the unpopular [[Royal Titles Act 1876|Royal Titles Act]], however, shattered Disraeli's authority in the House of Commons&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Fight in Bulgaria during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)|Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78]]]]In July 1875 Serb populations in [[Bosnia]] and [[Herzegovina]], then provinces of the Ottoman Empire, rose [[Herzegovina Uprising (1875–77)|in revolt]] against their Turkish masters, alleging religious persecution and poor administration</span>
				<span class='text'>The following January, Sultan [[Abdülaziz]], who ruled the empire, agreed to reforms proposed by Hungarian statesman [[Julius Andrássy]], but the rebels, suspecting they might win their freedom, continued their uprising, joined by militants in Serbia [[April Uprising|and Bulgaria]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Turks suppressed the Bulgarian uprising harshly, and when reports of these actions escaped, Disraeli and Derby stated in Parliament that they did not believe them</span>
				<span class='text'>Disraeli called them &quot;coffee-house babble&quot; and dismissed allegations of torture by the Ottomans since &quot;Oriental people usually terminate their connections with culprits in a more expeditious fashion&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Roberts, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>150–151&lt;/ref&gt;Gladstone, who had left the Liberal leadership and retired from public life, was appalled by reports of [[Batak massacre|atrocities in Bulgaria]], and in August 1876, penned a hastily written pamphlet arguing that the Turks should be deprived of Bulgaria because of what they had done there</span>
				<span class='text'> He sent a copy to Disraeli, who called it &quot;vindictive and ill-written&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>of all the Bulgarian horrors perhaps the greatest&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>399–403&lt;/ref&gt; Gladstone's pamphlet became an immense best-seller and rallied the Liberals to urge that the Ottoman Empire should no longer be a British ally</span>
				<span class='text'>Disraeli wrote to Lord Salisbury on 3 September, &quot;Had it not been for these unhappy 'atrocities', we should have settled a peace very honourable to England and satisfactory to Europe</span>
				<span class='text'> Now we are obliged to work from a new point of departure, and dictate to Turkey, who has forfeited all sympathy</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, pp</span>

				<span class='text'>409&lt;/ref&gt;  In advance of the conference, Disraeli sent Salisbury private word to seek British military occupation of Bulgaria and Bosnia, and British control of the [[Turkish Army]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Salisbury ignored these instructions, which his biographer, [[Andrew Roberts (historian)|Andrew Roberts]] deemed &quot;ludicrous&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Roberts, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>160–161&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the conference failed to reach agreement with the Turks</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Weintraub, p</span>
				<span class='text'>571&lt;/ref&gt;Parliament opened in February 1877, with Disraeli now in the Lords as Earl of Beaconsfield</span>
				<span class='text'>He spoke only once there in the 1877 session on the Eastern Question, stating on 20 February that there was a need for stability in the Balkans, and that forcing Turkey into territorial concessions would do nothing to secure it</span>
				<span class='text'> The Prime Minister wanted a deal with the Ottomans whereby Britain would temporarily occupy strategic areas to deter the Russians from war, to be returned on the signing of a peace treaty, but found little support in his cabinet, which favoured partition of the Ottoman Empire</span>
				<span class='text'>As Disraeli, by then in poor health, continued to battle within the cabinet, Russia invaded Turkey on 21 April, beginning the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)|Russo-Turkish War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Weintraub, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>576–577&lt;/ref&gt;====Congress of Berlin===={{main|Congress of Berlin}}The Russians pushed through Ottoman territory and by December 1877 had captured the strategic Bulgarian town of [[Pleven|Plevna]]; their march on Constantinople seemed inevitable</span>
				<span class='text'> The war divided the British, but the Russian success caused some to forget the atrocities and call for intervention on the Turkish side</span>
				<span class='text'> Others hoped for further Russian successes</span>
				<span class='text'>The fall of Plevna was a major story for weeks in the newspapers, and Disraeli's warnings that Russia was a threat to British interests in the eastern Mediterranean were deemed prophetic</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[jingoism|jingoistic]] attitude of many Britons increased Disraeli's political support, and the Queen acted to help him as well, showing her favour by visiting him at Hughenden—the first time she had visited the country home of her Prime Minister since [[Second Melbourne ministry|the Melbourne ministry]]</span>
				<span class='text'>At the end of January 1878, the Ottoman Emperor appealed to Britain to save Constantinople</span>
				<span class='text'> Amid war fever in Britain, the government asked Parliament to vote £6,000,000 to prepare the [[British Army|Army]] and [[Royal Navy|Navy]] for war</span>
				<span class='text'> Gladstone, who had involved himself again in politics, opposed the measure, but less than half his party voted with him</span>

				<span class='text'> It would be initially Russian-occupied and many feared that it would give them a client state close to Constantinople</span>
				<span class='text'>Other Ottoman possessions in Europe would become independent; additional territory was to be ceded directly to Russia</span>
				<span class='text'>This was unacceptable to the British, who protested, hoping to get the Russians to agree to attend an international conference which German Chancellor Bismarck proposed to hold at Berlin</span>

				<span class='text'>The Russians were willing to make changes to the big Bulgaria, but were determined to retain their new possessions [[Bessarabia]] in Europe and [[Batum]] and [[Kars]] on the east coast of the [[Black Sea]]</span>
				<span class='text'>To counterbalance this, Britain required a possession in the Eastern Mediterranean where it might base ships and troops, and negotiated with the Ottomans for the cession of [[Cyprus]]</span>

				<span class='text'>284&lt;/ref&gt; Disraeli caused an uproar in the congress by making his opening address in English, rather than in French, hitherto accepted as the international language of diplomacy</span>
				<span class='text'> By one account, the British ambassador in Berlin, [[Odo Russell, 1st Baron Ampthill|Lord Odo Russell]], hoping to spare the delegates Disraeli's awful French accent, told Disraeli that the congress was hoping to hear a speech in the English tongue by one of its masters</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;b648&quot;&gt;Blake (1967), p</span>
				<span class='text'>648&lt;/ref&gt;Disraeli left much of the detailed work to Salisbury, concentrating his efforts on making it as difficult as possible for the broken-up big Bulgaria to reunite</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;b648&quot; /&gt; Disraeli did not have things all his own way: he intended that Batum be demilitarised, but the Russians obtained their preferred language, and in 1886, fortified the town</span>

				<span class='text'>]In the weeks after Berlin, Disraeli and the cabinet considered calling a general election to capitalise on the public applause he and Salisbury had received</span>
				<span class='text'> Parliaments were then for a seven-year term, and it was the custom not to go to the country until the sixth year unless forced to by events</span>
				<span class='text'>Only four and a half years had passed since the last general election</span>
				<span class='text'> Additionally, they did not see any clouds on the horizon that might forecast Conservative defeat if they waited</span>
				<span class='text'>This decision not to seek re-election has often been cited as a great mistake by Disraeli</span>
				<span class='text'> Blake, however, pointed out that results in local elections had been moving against the Conservatives, and doubted if Disraeli missed any great opportunity by waiting</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Blake (1967), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>655–656&lt;/ref&gt;As successful invasions of India generally came through Afghanistan, the British had observed and sometimes intervened there since the 1830s, hoping to keep the Russians out</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1878 the Russians sent a mission to Kabul; it was not rejected by the Afghans, as the British had hoped</span>
				<span class='text'> The British then proposed to send their own mission, insisting that the Russians be sent away</span>
				<span class='text'> The [[Viceroy of India|Viceroy]], [[Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton|Lord Lytton]], concealed his plans to issue this ultimatum from Disraeli, and when the Prime Minister insisted he take no action, went ahead anyway</span>
				<span class='text'>When the Afghans made no answer, the British advanced against them in the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]], and under [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts]] easily defeated them</span>
				<span class='text'>The British installed a new ruler, and left a mission and garrison in Kabul</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Blake (1967), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>658–663&lt;/ref&gt;British policy in South Africa was to encourage federation between the British-run [[Cape Colony]] and [[Colony of Natal|Natal]], and the [[Boer]] republics, the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] (annexed by Britain in 1877) and the [[Orange Free State]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The governor of Cape Colony, [[Bartle Frere|Sir Bartle Frere]], believing that the federation could not be accomplished until the native tribes acknowledged British rule, made demands on the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] and their king, [[Cetewayo]], which they were certain to reject</span>
				<span class='text'>As Zulu troops could not marry until they had washed their spears in blood, they were eager for combat</span>
				<span class='text'>Frere did not send word to the cabinet of what he had done until the ultimatum was about to expire</span>
				<span class='text'>Disraeli and the cabinet reluctantly backed him, and in early January 1879 resolved to send reinforcements</span>
				<span class='text'> Before they could arrive, on 22 January, a Zulu ''[[impi]]'', or army, moving with great speed and stealth, ambushed and destroyed a British encampment in South Africa in the [[Battle of Isandlwana]]</span>

				<span class='text'> In December 1878, he was offered the Liberal nomination at the next election for [[Edinburghshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Edinburghshire]], a constituency popularly known as Midlothian</span>
				<span class='text'>The small Scottish electorate was dominated by two noblemen, the Conservative [[Walter Montagu Douglas Scott, 5th Duke of Buccleuch|Duke of Buccleuch]] and the Liberal [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Earl of Rosebery]]</span>
				<span class='text'> The Earl, a friend of both Disraeli and Gladstone who would succeed the latter after his final term as Prime Minister, had journeyed to the United States to view politics there, and was convinced that aspects of American electioneering could be translated to the United Kingdom</span>
				<span class='text'> On his advice, Gladstone accepted the offer in January 1879, and later that year began his [[Midlothian campaign]], speaking not only in Edinburgh, but across Britain, attacking Disraeli, to huge crowds</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Aldous, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>290–295&lt;/ref&gt;Conservative chances of re-election were damaged by the poor weather, and consequent effects on agriculture</span>
				<span class='text'> Four consecutive wet summers through 1879 had led to poor harvests in the United Kingdom</span>
				<span class='text'> In the past, the farmer had the consolation of higher prices at such times, but with bumper crops cheaply transported from the United States, grain prices remained low</span>
				<span class='text'> Other European nations, faced with similar circumstances, opted for protection, and Disraeli was urged to reinstitute the Corn Laws</span>
				<span class='text'>He declined, stating that he regarded the matter as settled</span>
				<span class='text'> Protection would have been highly unpopular among the newly enfranchised urban working classes, as it would raise their cost of living</span>
				<span class='text'>Amid an economic slump generally, the Conservatives lost support among farmers</span>

				<span class='text'>Though many commented on how healthy he looked, it took him great effort to appear so, and when he told the audience he expected to speak to the dinner again the following year, attendees chuckled—Gladstone was then in the midst of his campaign</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Weintraub, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>616–618&lt;/ref&gt;Despite this pessimism, Conservatives hopes were buoyed in early 1880 with successes in by-elections the Liberals had expected to win, concluding with victory in [[Southwark (UK Parliament constituency)|Southwark]], normally a Liberal stronghold</span>

				<span class='text'>Before his leadership of the Conservative Party, imperialism was the province of the Liberals, most notably Palmerston, with the Conservatives murmuring dissent across the aisle</span>
				<span class='text'>Disraeli made the Conservatives the party that most loudly supported both the Empire and military action to assert its primacy</span>
				<span class='text'>This came about in part because Disraeli's own views stemmed that way, in part because he saw advantage for the Conservatives, and partially in reaction against Gladstone, who disliked the expense of empire</span>
				<span class='text'>Blake argued that Disraeli's imperialism &quot;decisively orientated the Conservative party for many years to come, and the tradition which he started was probably a bigger electoral asset in winning working-class support during the last quarter of the century than anything else&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Blake (1967), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>760–761&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians have commented on a romantic impulse behind Disraeli's approach to Empire and foreign affairs: Abbott writes, &quot;To the mystical Tory concepts of Throne, Church, Aristocracy and People, Disraeli added Empire</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Abbott, p</span>
				<span class='text'>22&lt;/ref&gt; Others have identified a strongly pragmatic aspect to his policies</span>
				<span class='text'>Gladstone's biographer [[Philip Magnus-Allcroft|Philip Magnus]] contrasted Disraeli's grasp of foreign affairs with that of Gladstone, who &quot;never understood that high moral principles, in their application to foreign policy, are more often destructive of political stability than motives of national self-interest</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Magnus, p</span>
