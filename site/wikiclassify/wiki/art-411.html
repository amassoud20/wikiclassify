				<span class='text'> Cromwell's father Robert was of modest means but still inside the gentry class</span>
				<span class='text'>As a younger son with many siblings, Robert inherited only a house at Huntingdon and a small amount of land</span>

				<span class='text'>A place in this influential network proved crucial to Cromwell’s military and political career</span>

				<span class='text'>==Crisis and recovery===Little evidence exists of Cromwell's religion at this stage</span>
				<span class='text'>His letter in 1626 to Henry Downhall, an [[Arminian]] minister, suggests that Cromwell had yet to be influenced by radical puritanism</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;Morrill, p</span>
				<span class='text'>4</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; However, there is evidence that Cromwell went through a period of personal crisis during the late 1620s and early 1630s</span>
				<span class='text'>He sought treatment for ''valde melancolicus'' (depression) from London doctor [[Theodore de Mayerne]] in 1628</span>
				<span class='text'>He was also caught up in a fight among the gentry of Huntingdon over a new charter for the town, as a result of which he was called before the [[Privy Council]] in 1630</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Morrill, pp</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Oliver Cromwell House Ely</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|Oliver Cromwell's house in [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]]]]In 1631 Cromwell sold most of his properties in Huntingdon—probably as a result of the dispute—and moved to a farmstead in [[St Ives, Cambridgeshire|St Ives]] in Cambridgeshire</span>
				<span class='text'>This signified a major step down in society compared with his previous position, and seems to have had a significant emotional and spiritual impact</span>
				<span class='text'>A 1638 letter survives from Cromwell to his cousin, the wife of Oliver St John, and gives an account of his spiritual awakening</span>
				<span class='text'>The letter outlines how, having been &quot;the chief of sinners&quot;, Cromwell had been called to be among &quot;the congregation of the firstborn&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; The language of this letter, which is saturated with biblical quotations and which represents Cromwell as having been saved from sin by God's mercy, places his faith firmly within the [[Independent (religion)|Independent]] beliefs that the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] had not gone far enough, that much of England was still living in sin, and that Catholic beliefs and practices needed to be fully removed from the church</span>
				<span class='text'>long with his brother Henry, Cromwell had kept a smallholding of chickens and sheep, selling eggs and wool to support himself, his lifestyle resembling that of a [[yeoman]] farmer</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1636 Cromwell inherited control of various properties in [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]] from his uncle on his mother's side, and his uncle's job as [[tithe]] collector for Ely Cathedral</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, his income is likely to have risen to around £300–400 per year;&lt;ref&gt;Gaunt, p</span>
				<span class='text'>4</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; by the end of the 1630s Cromwell had returned to the ranks of acknowledged gentry</span>
				<span class='text'>He had become a committed Puritan and had established important family links to leading families in London and [[Essex]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Member of Parliament: 1628–29 and 1640–42==Cromwell became the Member of Parliament for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]] in the Parliament of 1628–1629, as a client of the Montagu family of [[Hinchingbrooke House]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He made little impression: records for the Parliament show only one speech (against the [[Arminianism|Arminian]] Bishop [[Richard Neile]]), which was poorly received</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Morrill, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>5–26</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; After dissolving this Parliament, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] ruled without a Parliament for the next 11 years</span>
				<span class='text'>When Charles faced the Scottish rebellion known as the [[Bishops' Wars]], shortage of funds forced him to call a Parliament again in 1640</span>
				<span class='text'>Cromwell was returned to this Parliament as member for [[Cambridge (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge]], but it lasted for only three weeks and became known as the [[Short Parliament]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Cromwell moved his family from Ely to London in 1640</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Cromwell: Our Chief of Men'', by [[Antonia Fraser]], Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London 1973&lt;/ref&gt;A second Parliament was called later the same year, and became known as the [[Long Parliament]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Cromwell was again returned as member for Cambridge</span>
				<span class='text'>As with the Parliament of 1628–29, it is likely that Cromwell owed his position to the patronage of others, which might explain why in the first week of the Parliament he was in charge of presenting a petition for the release of [[John Lilburne]], who had become a puritan cause-celebre after his arrest for importing religious tracts from The Netherlands</span>
				<span class='text'>For the first two years of the Long Parliament Cromwell was linked to the godly group of aristocrats in the [[House of Lords]] and Members of the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] with whom he had established familial and religious links in the 1630s, such as the Earls of [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Essex]], [[Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick|Warwick]] and [[Francis Russell, 4th Earl of Bedford|Bedford]], Oliver St John, and [[William Fiennes, 1st Viscount Saye and Sele|Viscount Saye and Sele]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; At this stage, the group had an agenda of reformation: the executive checked by regular parliaments, and the moderate extension of liberty of conscience</span>
				<span class='text'>Cromwell appears to have taken a role in some of this group's political manoeuvres</span>
				<span class='text'>In May 1641, for example, it was Cromwell who put forward the second reading of the Annual Parliaments Bill and later took a role in drafting the [[Root and Branch Bill]] for the abolition of [[episcopacy]]</span>

				<span class='text'>He recruited a cavalry troop in Cambridgeshire after blocking a valuable shipment of silver plate from Cambridge colleges that was meant for the king</span>
				<span class='text'>Cromwell and his troop then rode to, but arrived too late to take part in, the indecisive [[Battle of Edgehill]] on 23 October 1642</span>
				<span class='text'>The troop was recruited to be a full regiment in the winter of 1642 and 1643, making up part of the [[Eastern Association]] under the [[Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester|Earl of Manchester]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Cromwell's experience at Newbury, where Manchester had let the King's army slip out of an encircling manoeuvre, led to a serious dispute with Manchester, whom he believed to be less than enthusiastic in his conduct of the war</span>

				<span class='text'>1649 by [[Robert Walker (painter)|Robert Walker]]]]===New Model Army===Partly in response to the failure to capitalise on their victory at Marston Moor, Parliament passed the [[Self-Denying Ordinance]] in early 1645</span>
				<span class='text'>This forced members of the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] and the [[House of Lords|Lords]], such as [[Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester|Manchester]], to choose between civil office and military command</span>
				<span class='text'>All of them—except Cromwell, whose commission was given continued extensions and was allowed to remain in parliament—chose to renounce their military positions</span>
				<span class='text'>The Ordinance also decreed that the army be &quot;remodelled&quot; on a national basis, replacing the old county associations; Cromwell contributed significantly to these military reforms</span>
				<span class='text'>In April 1645 the [[New Model Army]] finally took to the field, with [[Sir Thomas Fairfax]] in command and Cromwell as Lieutenant-General of cavalry and second-in-command</span>
				<span class='text'>By this time, the Parliamentarians' field army outnumbered the King's by roughly two to one</span>
				<span class='text'>==Battle of Naseby 1645===At the critical [[Battle of Naseby]] in June 1645, the New Model Army smashed the King's major army</span>
				<span class='text'>Cromwell led his wing with great success at Naseby, again routing the Royalist cavalry</span>
				<span class='text'>At the [[Battle of Langport]] on 10 July, Cromwell participated in the defeat of the last sizeable Royalist field army</span>
				<span class='text'>Naseby and Langport effectively ended the King's hopes of victory, and the subsequent Parliamentarian campaigns involved taking the remaining fortified Royalist positions in the west of England</span>
				<span class='text'>In October 1645, Cromwell besieged and took the wealthy and formidable Catholic fortress [[Basing House]], later to be accused of killing 100 of its 300-man Royalist garrison after its surrender</span>

				<span class='text'>Charles I surrendered to the Scots on 5 May 1646, effectively ending the [[First English Civil War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Cromwell and Fairfax took the formal surrender of the Royalists at [[Oxford]] in June</span>
				<span class='text'>==Cromwell's military style===Cromwell had no formal training in military tactics, and followed the common practice of ranging his [[cavalry]] in three ranks and pressing forward, relying on impact rather than firepower</span>
				<span class='text'>His strengths were an instinctive ability to lead and train his men, and his [[moral authority]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In a war fought mostly by amateurs, these strengths were significant and are likely to have contributed to the discipline of his cavalry</span>

				<span class='text'>''Cromwell as a soldier'', in Morrill, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>17–118</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Cromwell introduced close-order cavalry formations, with troopers riding knee to knee; this was an innovation in England at the time, and was a major factor in his success</span>
				<span class='text'>He kept his troops close together following skirmishes where they had gained superiority, rather than allowing them to chase opponents off the battlefield</span>
				<span class='text'>This facilitated further engagements in short order, which allowed greater intensity and quick reaction to battle developments</span>
				<span class='text'>This style of command was decisive at both Marston Moor and Naseby</span>

				<span class='text'>154–161&lt;/ref&gt;==Politics: 1647–49==In February 1647 Cromwell suffered from an illness that kept him out of political life for over a month</span>
				<span class='text'>By the time he had recovered, the Parliamentarians were split over the issue of the king</span>
				<span class='text'>A majority in both Houses pushed for a settlement that would pay off the Scottish army, disband much of the New Model Army, and restore Charles I in return for a [[Presbyterian]] settlement of the Church</span>
				<span class='text'>Cromwell rejected the Scottish model of Presbyterianism, which threatened to replace one authoritarian hierarchy with another</span>
				<span class='text'>The New Model Army, radicalised by the failure of the Parliament to pay the wages it was owed, petitioned against these changes, but the Commons declared the petition unlawful</span>
				<span class='text'>In May 1647 Cromwell was sent to the army's headquarters in [[Saffron Walden]] to negotiate with them, but failed to agree</span>
				<span class='text'>n June 1647, a troop of cavalry under Cornet [[George Joyce]] seized the King from Parliament's imprisonment</span>
				<span class='text'>After the King was in arm's reach of Cromwell, he was eager to find out what conditions the King would be willing to compromise on if his authority was restored</span>
				<span class='text'>The King appeared to be willing to compromise, so Cromwell employed his son-in-law, Henry Ireton, to draw up proposals for a constitutional settlement</span>
				<span class='text'>Proposals were drafted multiple times with different changes until finally the &quot;[[Heads of Proposals]]&quot; pleased Cromwell in principle and would allow for further negotiations</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Many in the army, such as the [[Levellers]] led by [[John Lilburne]], thought this was not enough and demanded full political equality for all men, leading to tense debates in Putney during the autumn of 1647 between Fairfax, Cromwell and Ireton on the one hand, and radical Levellers like [[Thomas Rainsborough|Colonel Rainsborough]] on the other</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Putney Debates]] ultimately broke up without reaching a resolution</span>

				<span class='text'>--&gt;The failure to conclude a political agreement with the king led eventually to the outbreak of the [[Second English Civil War]] in 1648, when the King tried to regain power by force of arms</span>
				<span class='text'>Cromwell first put down a Royalist uprising in south Wales led by [[Rowland Laugharne]], winning back [[Chepstow Castle]] on 25 May and six days later forcing the surrender of [[Tenby]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The castle at [[Carmarthen]] was destroyed by burning</span>
				<span class='text'>The much stronger castle at [[Pembroke Castle|Pembroke]], however, fell only after a siege of eight weeks</span>
				<span class='text'>Cromwell dealt leniently with the ex-royalist soldiers, but less so with those who had previously been members of the parliamentary army, [[John Poyer]] eventually being executed in London after the drawing of lots</span>

				<span class='text'>k}}&lt;/ref&gt;Cromwell then marched north to deal with a pro-Royalist Scottish army (the [[Engagers]]) who had invaded England</span>
				<span class='text'>At [[Battle of Preston (1648)|Preston]], Cromwell, in sole command for the first time and with an army of 9,000, won a decisive victory against an army twice as large</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gardiner (1901), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>44–47; Gaunt (1997) 94–97</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;During 1648, Cromwell's letters and speeches started to become heavily based on biblical imagery, many of them meditations on the meaning of particular passages</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, after the battle of Preston, study of Psalms 17 and 105 led him to tell Parliament that &quot;they that are implacable and will not leave troubling the land may be speedily destroyed out of the land&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>A letter to Oliver St John in September 1648 urged him to read [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 8, in which the kingdom falls and only the godly survive</span>
				<span class='text'>On four occasions in letters in 1648 he referred to the story of [[Gideon]]'s defeat of the [[Midian]]ites at Ain Harod</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Morrill and Baker (2008), p</span>
				<span class='text'>1</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; These letters suggest that it was Cromwell's faith, rather than a commitment to radical politics, coupled with Parliament's decision to engage in negotiations with the king at the [[Treaty of Newport]], that convinced him that God had spoken against both the king and Parliament as lawful authorities</span>
				<span class='text'>For Cromwell, the army was now God's chosen instrument</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Adamson, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>6–84</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The episode shows Cromwell’s firm belief in &quot;[[Providentialism]]&quot;—that God was actively directing the affairs of the world, through the actions of &quot;chosen people&quot; (whom God had &quot;provided&quot; for such purposes)</span>
				<span class='text'>Cromwell believed, during the Civil Wars, that he was one of these people, and he interpreted victories as indications of God's approval of his actions, and defeats as signs that God was directing him in another direction</span>
				<span class='text'>==King tried and executed==={{main|High Court of Justice for the trial of Charles I}}In December 1648, those Members of Parliament who wished to continue negotiations with the king were prevented from sitting for parliament by a troop of soldiers headed by [[Thomas Pride|Colonel Thomas Pride]], an episode soon to be known as [[Pride's Purge]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus weakened, the remaining body of MPs, known as the [[Rump Parliament|Rump]], agreed that Charles should be tried on a charge of treason</span>
				<span class='text'>Cromwell was still in the north of England, dealing with Royalist resistance, when these events took place, but then returned to London</span>
				<span class='text'>On the day after Pride's Purge, he became a determined supporter of those pushing for the king's trial and execution, believing that killing Charles was the only way to end the civil wars</span>
				<span class='text'>Cromwell approved Thomas Brook's address to the House of Commons, which justified the trial and execution of the King on the basis of the Book of Numbers, chapter 35 and particularly verse 33 (''&quot;The land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;'')</span>
				<span class='text'>The death warrant for Charles was eventually signed by 59 of the trying court's members, including Cromwell (who was the third to sign it); Fairfax conspicuously refused to sign</span>
				<span class='text'>Charles I was executed on 30 January 1649</span>
				<span class='text'>=Establishment of the Commonwealth: 1649==[[File:Coat of Arms of the Commonwealth of England</span>
				<span class='text'>vg|left|thumb|160px|Arms of the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]]]]After the execution of the King, a republic was declared, known as the &quot;[[Commonwealth of England]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The &quot;Rump Parliament&quot; exercised both executive and legislative powers, with a smaller [[English Council of State|Council of State]] also having some executive functions</span>
				<span class='text'>Cromwell remained a member of the &quot;Rump&quot; and was appointed a member of the Council</span>
				<span class='text'>In the early months after the execution of Charles I, Cromwell tried but failed to unite the original group of &quot;Royal Independents&quot; centred around St John and Saye and Sele, which had fractured during 1648</span>
				<span class='text'>Cromwell had been connected to this group since before the outbreak of [[English Civil War|civil war]] in 1642 and had been closely associated with them during the 1640s</span>
				<span class='text'>However, only St John was persuaded to retain his seat in Parliament</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Cavalier Parliament|Royalists]], meanwhile, had regrouped in Ireland, having signed a treaty with the Irish known as &quot;[[Confederate Ireland|Confederate Catholics]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>In March, Cromwell was chosen by the Rump to command a campaign against them</span>
				<span class='text'>Preparations for an invasion of Ireland occupied Cromwell in the subsequent months</span>
				<span class='text'>In the latter part of the 1640s, Cromwell came across political dissidence in his &quot;[[New Model Army]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The &quot;[[Leveller]]&quot;, or &quot;[[Agitator]]&quot; movement was a political movement that emphasised popular sovereignty, extended suffrage, equality before the law, and religious tolerance</span>
				<span class='text'>These sentiments were expressed in the manifesto &quot;[[Agreement of the People]]&quot; in 1647</span>
				<span class='text'>Cromwell and the rest of the &quot;[[Grandees]]&quot; disagreed with these sentiments in that they gave too much freedom to the people; they believed that the vote should only extend to the landowners</span>
				<span class='text'>In the &quot;[[Putney Debates]]&quot; of 1647, the two groups debated these topics in hopes of forming a new constitution for England</span>
				<span class='text'>There were rebellions and mutinies following the debates, and in 1649, the [[Bishopsgate mutiny]] resulted in the execution of Leveller [[Robert Lockyer]] by firing squad</span>
				<span class='text'>The next month, the [[Banbury mutiny]] occurred with similar results</span>
				<span class='text'>Cromwell led the charge in quelling these rebellions</span>
				<span class='text'>After quelling Leveller mutinies within the English army at [[Andover, England|Andover]] and [[Burford]] in May, Cromwell departed for Ireland from [[Bristol]] at the end of July</span>

				<span class='text'>Parliament's key opposition was the military threat posed by the alliance of the [[Confederate Ireland|Irish Confederate Catholics]] and English royalists (signed in 1649)</span>
				<span class='text'>The Confederate-Royalist alliance was judged to be the biggest single threat facing the Commonwealth</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the political situation in Ireland in 1649 was extremely fractured: there were also separate forces of Irish Catholics who were opposed to the royalist alliance, and Protestant royalist forces that were gradually moving towards Parliament</span>
				<span class='text'>Cromwell said in a speech to the army Council on 23 March that &quot;I had rather be overthrown by a Cavalierish interest than a Scotch interest; I had rather be overthrown by a Scotch interest than an Irish interest and I think of all this is the most dangerous&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Lenihan, Padraig (2000)</span>
				<span class='text'>''Confederate Catholics at War'' (Cork University Press), ISBN 1-85918-244-5, p</span>
				<span class='text'>15</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Cromwell's hostility to the Irish was religious as well as political</span>
				<span class='text'>He was passionately opposed to the Catholic Church, which he saw as denying the primacy of the Bible in favour of papal and clerical authority, and which he blamed for suspected tyranny and persecution of Protestants in Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Fraser, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>4–76</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Cromwell's association of Catholicism with persecution was deepened with the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This rebellion, although intended to be bloodless, was marked by massacres of English and Scottish Protestant settlers by [[Gael|Irish (&quot;Gaels&quot;)]] and [[Old English (Ireland)|Old English in Ireland]], and Highland Scot Catholics in Ireland</span>
				<span class='text'>These settlers had settled on land seized from former, native Catholic owners to make way for the non-native Protestants</span>
				<span class='text'>These factors contributed to the brutality of the Cromwell military campaign in Ireland</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Fraser, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>26–328</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Parliament had planned to re-conquer Ireland since 1641 and had already sent an invasion force there in 1647</span>
				<span class='text'>Cromwell's invasion of 1649 was much larger and, with the civil war in England over, could be regularly reinforced and re-supplied</span>
				<span class='text'>His nine-month military campaign was brief and effective, though it did not end the war in Ireland</span>
				<span class='text'>Before his invasion, Parliamentarian forces held only outposts in [[Dublin]] and [[Derry]]</span>
				<span class='text'>When he departed Ireland, they occupied most of the eastern and northern parts of the country</span>
				<span class='text'>After his landing at Dublin on 15 August 1649 (itself only recently defended from an Irish and English Royalist attack at the [[Battle of Rathmines]]), Cromwell took the fortified port towns of [[Drogheda]] and [[Wexford]] to secure logistical supply from England</span>
				<span class='text'>At the [[Siege of Drogheda]] in September 1649, Cromwell's troops killed nearly 3,500 people after the town's capture—comprising around 2,700 Royalist soldiers and all the men in the town carrying arms, including some civilians, prisoners and Roman Catholic priests</span>

				<span class='text'>While Cromwell was apparently trying to negotiate surrender terms, some of his soldiers broke into the town, killed 2,000 Irish troops and up to 1,500 civilians, and burned much of the town</span>

				<span class='text'>470&lt;/ref&gt; No disciplinary actions were taken against his forces subsequent to this second massacre</span>
				<span class='text'>fter the taking of Drogheda, Cromwell sent a column north to [[Ulster]] to secure the north of the country and went on to [[Siege of Waterford|besiege Waterford]], [[Kilkenny]] and [[Clonmel]] in Ireland's south-east</span>
				<span class='text'>Kilkenny surrendered on terms, as did many other towns like [[New Ross]] and [[Carlow]], but Cromwell failed to take [[Waterford]], and at the [[siege of Clonmel]] in May 1650 he lost up to 2,000 men in abortive assaults before the town surrendered</span>

				<span class='text'>00</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;One of his major victories in Ireland was diplomatic rather than military</span>
				<span class='text'>With the help of [[Roger Boyle, 1st Earl of Orrery]], Cromwell persuaded the Protestant Royalist troops in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] to change sides and fight with the Parliament</span>

				<span class='text'>21–322; Lenihan, p</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; At this point, word reached Cromwell that [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] (son of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]) had landed in Scotland from exile in France and been proclaimed King by the [[Covenanter]] regime</span>
				<span class='text'>Cromwell therefore returned to England from [[Youghal]] on 26 May 1650 to counter this threat</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The Parliamentarian conquest of Ireland dragged on for almost three years after Cromwell's departure</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; As with many incidents in Cromwell's career, there is debate about the extent of his sincerity in making these public statements: the Rump Parliament's later [[Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652|Act of Settlement]] of 1652 set out a much harsher policy of execution and confiscation of property of anyone who had supported the uprisings</span>

				<span class='text'>43&lt;/ref&gt; At least two accounts agree that Cromwell snatched up the [[ceremonial mace|mace]], symbol of Parliament's power, and demanded that the &quot;bauble&quot; be taken away</span>

				<span class='text'>In his speech at the opening of the assembly on 4 July 1653, Cromwell thanked God’s providence that he believed had brought England to this point and set out their divine mission: &quot;truly God hath called you to this work by, I think, as wonderful providences as ever passed upon the sons of men in so short a time</span>

				<span class='text'>vg| alt2      = |Banner of Oliver Cromwell }}After the dissolution of the Barebones Parliament, [[John Lambert (general)|John Lambert]] put forward a new constitution known as the [[Instrument of Government (1653)|Instrument of Government]], closely modelled on the [[Heads of Proposals]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It made Cromwell Lord Protector for life to undertake “the chief magistracy and the administration of government”</span>
				<span class='text'>Cromwell was sworn in as Lord Protector on 16 December 1653, with a ceremony in which he wore plain black clothing, rather than any monarchical regalia</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gaunt, p</span>
				<span class='text'>55</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; However, from this point on Cromwell signed his name 'Oliver P', the ''P'' being an abbreviation for ''Protector'', which was similar to the style of monarchs who used an ''R'' to mean ''Rex'' or ''Regina'', and it soon became the norm for others to address him as &quot;Your Highness&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gaunt, p</span>
				<span class='text'>56</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; As Protector, he had the power to call and dissolve parliaments but was obliged under the Instrument to seek the majority vote of a Council of State</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, Cromwell's power was buttressed by his continuing popularity among the army</span>
				<span class='text'>As the Lord Protector he was paid £100,000 a year</span>

				<span class='text'>The first was &quot;healing and settling&quot; the nation after the chaos of the civil wars and the regicide, which meant establishing a stable form for the new government to take</span>

				<span class='text'>72</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Although Cromwell declared to the first Protectorate Parliament that, &quot;Government by one man and a parliament is fundamental,&quot; in practice social priorities took precedence over forms of government</span>
				<span class='text'>Such forms were, he said, &quot;but&amp;nbsp;</span>

				<span class='text'>dross and dung in comparison of Christ&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Hirst, p</span>
				<span class='text'>27</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The social priorities did not, despite the revolutionary nature of the government, include any meaningful attempt to reform the social order</span>
				<span class='text'>Cromwell declared, &quot;A nobleman, a gentleman, a yeoman; the distinction of these: that is a good interest of the nation, and a great one!&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>rg |accessdate=27 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small-scale reform such as that carried out on the [[judiciary|judicial system]] were outweighed by attempts to restore order to English politics</span>
				<span class='text'>Direct taxation was reduced slightly and peace was made with the Dutch, ending the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ngland's American colonies in this period consisted of the [[New England Confederation]], the [[Providence Plantation]], the [[Virginia Colony]] and the [[Maryland Colony]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Cromwell soon secured the submission of these and largely left them to their own affairs, intervening only to curb his fellow Puritans who were usurping control over the Maryland Colony at the [[Battle of the Severn]], by his confirming the former Catholic proprietorship and edict of tolerance there</span>
				<span class='text'>Of all the English dominions, Virginia was the most resentful of Cromwell's rule, and Cavalier emigration there mushroomed during the Protectorate</span>
				<span class='text'>romwell famously stressed the quest to restore order in his speech to the [[First Protectorate Parliament|first Protectorate parliament]] at its inaugural meeting on 3 September 1654</span>
				<span class='text'>He declared that &quot;healing and settling&quot; were the &quot;great end of your meeting&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Roots 1989, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>1–56</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; However, the Parliament was quickly dominated by those pushing for more radical, properly republican reforms</span>
				<span class='text'>After some initial gestures approving appointments previously made by Cromwell, the Parliament began to work on a radical programme of constitutional reform</span>
				<span class='text'>Rather than opposing Parliament’s bill, Cromwell dissolved them on 22 January 1655</span>

				<span class='text'>Protector&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>}}Cromwell's second objective was spiritual and moral reform</span>
				<span class='text'>He aimed to restore liberty of conscience and promote both outward and inward godliness throughout England</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hirst, p</span>
				<span class='text'>73</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; During the early months of the Protectorate, a set of &quot;triers&quot; was established to assess the suitability of future parish ministers, and a related set of &quot;ejectors&quot; was set up to dismiss ministers and schoolmasters who were deemed unsuitable for office</span>
				<span class='text'>The triers and the ejectors were intended to be at the vanguard of Cromwell's reform of parish worship</span>
				<span class='text'>This second objective is also the context in which to see the constitutional experiment of the [[Rule of the Major-Generals|Major Generals]] that followed the dissolution of the first Protectorate Parliament</span>
				<span class='text'>After a [[Penruddock uprising|royalist uprising]] in March 1655, led by [[John Penruddock|Sir John Penruddock]], Cromwell (influenced by Lambert) divided England into military districts ruled by Army Major Generals who answered only to him</span>
				<span class='text'>The 15 major generals and deputy major generals—called &quot;godly governors&quot;—were central not only to [[national security]], but Cromwell's crusade to reform the nation's morals</span>
				<span class='text'>The generals not only supervised [[militia]] forces and security commissions, but collected taxes and ensured support for the government in the English and Welsh provinces</span>
				<span class='text'>Commissioners for securing the peace of the commonwealth were appointed to work with them in every county</span>
				<span class='text'>While a few of these commissioners were career politicians, most were zealous puritans who welcomed the major-generals with open arms and embraced their work with enthusiasm</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the major-generals lasted less than a year</span>
				<span class='text'>Many feared they threatened their reform efforts and authority</span>
				<span class='text'>Their position was further harmed by a tax proposal by Major General John Desborough to provide financial backing for their work, which the [[Second Protectorate Parliament|second Protectorate parliament]]—instated in September 1656—voted down for fear of a permanent military state</span>
				<span class='text'>Ultimately, however, Cromwell's failure to support his men, sacrificing them to his opponents, caused their demise</span>
				<span class='text'>Their activities between November 1655 and September 1656 had, however, reopened the wounds of the 1640s and deepened antipathies to the regime</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;As Lord Protector, Cromwell was aware of the Jewish community's involvement in the economics of the Netherlands, now England's leading commercial rival</span>
				<span class='text'>It was this—allied to Cromwell's tolerance of the right to private worship of those who fell outside evangelical Puritanism—that led to his [[Resettlement of the Jews in England|encouraging Jews to return to England]] in 1657, over 350 years after their banishment by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], in the hope that they would help speed up the recovery of the country after the disruption of the Civil Wars</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hirst, p</span>
				<span class='text'>37</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; There was a longer-term motive for Cromwell's decision to allow the Jews to return to England, and that was the hope that they would convert to Christianity and therefore hasten the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, ultimately based on {{bibleverse||Matthew|23:37–39|NKJV}} and {{bibleverse||Romans|11|NKJV}}</span>
				<span class='text'>At the Whitehall conference of December 1655 he quoted from St</span>
				<span class='text'>Paul's Epistle to the {{bibleverse||Romans|10:12–15|NKJV}} on the need to send Christian preachers to the Jews</span>
				<span class='text'>Cromwell's long-term religious motive for readmitting the Jews to England should not be doubted, after all he was serious enough to ban Christmas as a pagan festival</span>

				<span class='text'>tm&lt;/ref&gt;In 1657, Cromwell was offered the crown by Parliament as part of a revised constitutional settlement, presenting him with a dilemma since he had been &quot;instrumental&quot; in abolishing the monarchy</span>
				<span class='text'>Cromwell agonised for six weeks over the offer</span>
				<span class='text'>He was attracted by the prospect of stability it held out, but in a speech on 13 April 1657 he made clear that God's providence had spoken against the office of king: “I would not seek to set up that which Providence hath destroyed and laid in the dust, and I would not build [[Jericho]] again”</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Roots 1989, p</span>
				<span class='text'>28</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The reference to Jericho harks back to a previous occasion on which Cromwell had wrestled with his conscience when the news reached England of the defeat of an expedition against the Spanish-held island of [[Hispaniola]] in the [[West Indies]] in 1655—comparing himself to [[Achan (Bible)|Achan]], who had brought the [[Israelites]] defeat after bringing plunder back to camp after the capture of Jericho</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Instead, Cromwell was ceremonially re-installed as Lord Protector on 26 June 1657 at [[Westminster Hall]], sitting upon [[King Edward's Chair]], which was moved specially from [[Westminster Abbey]] for the occasion</span>
				<span class='text'>The event in part echoed a [[coronation]], using many of its symbols and regalia, such as a purple ermine-lined robe, a sword of justice and a sceptre (but not a crown or an orb)</span>
				<span class='text'>But, most notably, the office of Lord Protector was still not to become hereditary, though Cromwell was now able to nominate his own successor</span>
				<span class='text'>Cromwell's new rights and powers were laid out in the [[Humble Petition and Advice]], a legislative instrument which replaced the Instrument of Government</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite failing to restore the Crown, this new constitution did set up many of the vestiges of the ancient constitution including a house of life peers (in place of the House of Lords)</span>
				<span class='text'>In the Humble Petition it was called the [[Cromwell's Other House|Other House]] as the Commons could not agree on a suitable name</span>
				<span class='text'>Furthermore, Oliver Cromwell increasingly took on more of the trappings of monarchy</span>
				<span class='text'>In particular, he created two baronages after the acceptance of the Humble Petition and Advice—Charles Howard was made Viscount Morpeth and Baron Gisland in July 1657 and [[Edmund Dunch, Baron Burnell of East Wittenham|Edmund Dunch]] was created Baron Burnell of East Wittenham in April 1658</span>
				<span class='text'>Cromwell, however, was at pains to minimise his role, describing himself as a constable or watchman</span>

				<span class='text'>Several biographies were published soon after his death</span>
				<span class='text'>An example is ''The Perfect Politician'', which described how Cromwell &quot;loved men more than books&quot; and gave a nuanced assessment of him as an energetic campaigner for liberty of conscience brought down by pride and ambition</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Morrill, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>279–81</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; An equally nuanced but less positive assessment was published in 1667 by [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon]], in his ''History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England''</span>
				<span class='text'>Clarendon famously declared that Cromwell &quot;will be looked upon by posterity as a brave bad man&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=g9&gt;Gaunt, p</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He argued that Cromwell's rise to power had been helped not only by his great spirit and energy, but also by his ruthlessness</span>
				<span class='text'>Clarendon was not one of Cromwell's confidantes, and his account was written after the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of the monarchy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=g9/&gt;During the early eighteenth century, Cromwell's image began to be adopted and reshaped by the [[British Whig Party|Whigs]], as part of a wider project to give their political objectives historical legitimacy</span>
				<span class='text'>A version of [[Edmund Ludlow]]’s ''Memoirs'', re-written by [[John Toland]] to excise the radical Puritanical elements and replace them with a [[Whiggish]] brand of republicanism, presented the Cromwellian Protectorate as a military tyranny</span>
				<span class='text'>Through Ludlow, Toland portrayed Cromwell as a [[dictator|despot]] who crushed the beginnings of democratic rule in the 1640s</span>

				<span class='text'>[[Thomas Carlyle]] continued this reassessment of Cromwell in the 1840s, publishing an annotated collection of Cromwell's letters and speeches in which he described English Puritanism as &quot;the last of all our Heroisms&quot; while taking a negative view of his own era</span>

				<span class='text'>df}}&lt;/ref&gt;By the late 19th century, Carlyle's portrayal of Cromwell, stressing the centrality of puritan morality and earnestness, had become assimilated into [[Whig history|Whig]] and [[Liberal party (UK)|Liberal]] [[historiography]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Oxford civil war historian [[Samuel Rawson Gardiner]] concluded that &quot;the man—it is ever so with the noblest—was greater than his work&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gardiner (1901), p</span>
				<span class='text'>15</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Gardiner stressed Cromwell’s dynamic and mercurial character, and his role in dismantling [[absolute monarchy]], while underestimating Cromwell’s religious conviction</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Worden, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>56–260</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Cromwell’s foreign policy also provided an attractive forerunner of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[imperialism|imperial expansion]], with Gardiner stressing his “constancy of effort to make England great by land and sea”</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gardiner (1901), p</span>
				<span class='text'>18</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;During the first half of the twentieth century, Cromwell's reputation was often influenced by the rise of fascism in [[Nazi Germany]] and in [[Italian fascism|Italy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Wilbur Cortez Abbott]], for example—a Harvard historian—devoted much of his career to compiling and editing a multi-volume collection of Cromwell's letters and speeches</span>
				<span class='text'>In this work, which was published between 1937 and 1947, Abbott began to argue that Cromwell was a proto-fascist</span>
				<span class='text'>However, subsequent historians such as [[John Morrill (historian)|John Morrill]] have criticised both Abbott's interpretation of Cromwell and his editorial approach</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Morrill | first1 = John | year = 1990 | title = Textualising and Contextualising Cromwell | url = | journal = Historical Journal | volume = 33 | issue = 3| pages = 629–39 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernest Barker]] similarly compared the Independents to the Nazis</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, not all historical comparisons made at this time drew on contemporary military dictators</span>
				<span class='text'>ate twentieth-century historians re-examined the nature of Cromwell's faith and of his authoritarian regime</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Austin Woolrych]] explored the issue of &quot;dictatorship&quot; in depth, arguing that Cromwell was subject to two conflicting forces: his obligation to the army and his desire to achieve a lasting settlement by winning back the confidence of the political nation as a whole</span>
				<span class='text'>Woolrych argued that the dictatorial elements of Cromwell's rule stemmed not so much from its military origins or the participation of army officers in civil government, as from his constant commitment to the interest of the people of God and his conviction that suppressing vice and encouraging virtue constituted the chief end of government</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Woolrych, Austin (1990)</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Historians such as John Morrill, Blair Worden and J</span>
				<span class='text'>C</span>
				<span class='text'>Davis have developed this theme, revealing the extent to which Cromwell’s writing and speeches are suffused with biblical references, and arguing that his radical actions were driven by his zeal for godly reformation</span>
