				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Wordsworth was taught to read by his mother and attended, first, a tiny school of low quality in Cockermouth, then a school in Penrith for the children of upper-class families, where he was taught by Ann Birkett, who insisted on instilling in her students traditions that included pursuing both scholarly and local activities, especially the festivals around Easter, May Day and [[Shrove Tuesday]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Wordsworth was taught both the Bible and the ''Spectator'', but little else</span>
				<span class='text'>It was at the school in Penrith that he met the Hutchinsons, including Mary, who later became his wife</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In this preface, which some scholars consider a central work of Romantic literary theory, Wordsworth discusses what he sees as the elements of a new type of verse, one that is based on the &quot;real language of men&quot; and avoids the poetic diction of much 18th-century verse</span>
				<span class='text'>Wordsworth also gives his famous definition of poetry as &quot;the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: it takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquility,&quot; and calls his own poems in the book &quot;experimental&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>While Coleridge was intellectually stimulated by the journey, its main effect on Wordsworth was to produce homesickness</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=webbio/&gt; During the harsh winter of 1798–99 Wordsworth lived with Dorothy in [[Goslar]], and, despite extreme stress and loneliness, began work on the autobiographical piece that was later titled ''The Prelude''</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote a number of other famous poems in Goslar, including &quot;[[The Lucy poems]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>In the Autumn of 1799, Wordsworth and his sister returned to England and visited the Hutchinson family at Sockburn</span>
				<span class='text'> When Coleridge arrived back in England he travelled to the North with their publisher Joseph Cottle to meet Wordsworth and undertake a proposed tour of the Lake District</span>
				<span class='text'> This was the immediate cause of the siblings settling at [[Dove Cottage]] in [[Grasmere]] in the Lake District, this time with another poet, [[Robert Southey]] nearby</span>
				<span class='text'>Wordsworth, Coleridge and Southey came to be known as the &quot;[[Lake Poets]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''[[Recollections of the Lake Poets]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Throughout this period many of Wordsworth's poems revolve around themes of death, endurance, separation and grief</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1798–99 he started an autobiographical poem, which he referred to as the &quot;[[The Prelude|poem to Coleridge]]&quot; and which he planned would serve as an appendix to a larger work called ''The Recluse''</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1804 he began expanding this autobiographical work, having decided to make it a prologue rather than an appendix</span>
				<span class='text'>He completed this work, now generally referred to as the first version of ''[[The Prelude]]'', in 1805, but refused to publish such a personal work until he had completed the whole of ''The Recluse''</span>
				<span class='text'>The death of his brother John, also in 1805, affected him strongly and may have influenced his decisions about these works</span>
				<span class='text'>ordsworth's philosophical allegiances as articulated in ''[[The Prelude]]'' and in such shorter works as &quot;[[Lines written a few miles above Tintern Abbey]]&quot; have been a source of critical debate</span>
				<span class='text'>It was long supposed that Wordsworth relied chiefly on Coleridge for philosophical guidance, but more recently scholars have suggested that Wordsworth's ideas may have been formed years before he and Coleridge became friends in the mid-1790s</span>
				<span class='text'>In particular, while he was in revolutionary Paris in 1792 the 22-year-old Wordsworth made the acquaintance of the mysterious traveller [[John &quot;Walking&quot; Stewart]] (1747–1822),&lt;ref&gt;[[Kelly Grovier]], &quot;Dream Walker: A Wordsworth Mystery Solved&quot;, ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'', 16 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; who was nearing the end of his thirty years of wandering, on foot, from [[Madras]], India, through [[Persia]] and [[Arabia]], across Africa and Europe, and up through the fledgling United States</span>
				<span class='text'>By the time of their association Stewart had published an ambitious work of original materialist philosophy entitled ''The Apocalypse of Nature'' (London, 1791), to which many of Wordsworth's philosophical sentiments may well be indebted</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1807 Wordsworth published ''[[Poems in Two Volumes]]'', including &quot;[[Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Up to this point Wordsworth was known only for ''Lyrical Ballads'', and he hoped that this new collection would cement his reputation</span>
				<span class='text'>Its reception was lukewarm, however</span>

				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|right|Gravestone of William Wordsworth, [[Grasmere]], Cumbria]]William Wordsworth died from an aggravated case of [[pleurisy]] on 23 April 1850, and was buried at [[St Oswald's Church, Grasmere]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His widow Mary published his lengthy autobiographical &quot;poem to Coleridge&quot; as ''[[The Prelude]]'' several months after his death</span>
				<span class='text'>Though it failed to arouse much interest at that time, it has since come to be widely recognised as his masterpiece</span>

				<span class='text'>Abrams, editor of ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature: The Romantic Period'', writes of these five poems: &quot;This and the four following pieces are often grouped by editors as the 'Lucy poems,' even though 'A slumber did my spirit seal' does not identify the 'she' who is the subject of that poem</span>
				<span class='text'>All but the last were written in 1799, while Wordsworth and his sister were in Germany, and homesick</span>
				<span class='text'>There has been diligent speculation about the identity of Lucy, but it remains speculation</span>
				<span class='text'>The one certainty is that she is not the girl of Wordsworth's 'Lucy Gray'&quot; (Abrams 2000)</span>
