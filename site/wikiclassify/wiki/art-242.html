				<span class='text'>When the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|stock market crash of 1929]] reduced the demand for plays, Bogart turned to film</span>
				<span class='text'>His first great success was as Duke Mantee in ''[[The Petrified Forest]]'' (1936), and this led to a period of [[Typecasting (acting)|typecasting]] as a gangster with [[gangster film|films]] such as ''[[Angels with Dirty Faces]]'' (1938) and [[B-movie]]s like ''[[The Return of Doctor X]]'' (1939)</span>
				<span class='text'>ogart's breakthrough as a [[leading man]] came in 1941 with ''[[High Sierra (film)|High Sierra]]'' and ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]</span>
				<span class='text'>' The next year, his performance in ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (1943; Oscar nomination) raised him to the peak of his profession and, at the same time, cemented his trademark film persona, that of the hard-boiled cynic who ultimately shows his noble side</span>
				<span class='text'>Other successes followed, including ''[[To Have and Have Not (film)|To Have and Have Not]]'' (1944), ''[[The Big Sleep (1946 film)|The Big Sleep]]'' (1946), ''[[Dark Passage (film)|Dark Passage]]'' (1947), and ''[[Key Largo (film)|Key Largo]]'' (1948), all four with his wife [[Lauren Bacall]]; ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'' (1948); ''[[In a Lonely Place]]'' (1950); ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' (1951; [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Oscar]] won); ''[[Sabrina (1954 film)|Sabrina]]'' (1954); and ''[[The Caine Mutiny (film)|The Caine Mutiny]]'' (1954; Oscar nomination)</span>

				<span class='text'>The name &quot;Bogart&quot; comes from the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] surname &quot;Bogaert&quot;, which derives from the word &quot;bogaard&quot;, short for &quot;boomgaard&quot;, meaning &quot;orchard&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; &quot;I was brought up very unsentimentally but very straightforwardly</span>

				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt; As a boy, Bogart was teased for his curls, tidiness, the &quot;cute&quot; pictures his mother had him pose for, the [[Little Lord Fauntleroy]] clothes she dressed him in, and even for the name &quot;Humphrey&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Meyers_p9&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyers|1997|p=9</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt; From his father, Bogart inherited a tendency to needle, fondness for fishing, lifelong love of boating, and an attraction to strong-willed women</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Meyers_p22&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyers|1997|p=22</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hyams 1975, p</span>
				<span class='text'>12</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He was an indifferent, sullen student who showed no interest in after-school activities</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Meyers_p22&quot;/&gt; Later he went to the equally elite [[University-preparatory school|boarding school]] [[Phillips Academy]], where he was admitted based on family connections</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Meyers_p13&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyers|1997|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents hoped he would go on to Yale, but in 1918 Bogart was expelled</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Several reasons have been given: one claims that it was for throwing the headmaster (or a groundskeeper) into Rabbit Pond on campus</span>
				<span class='text'>Another cites smoking, drinking, poor academic performance, and possibly some inappropriate comments made to the staff</span>
				<span class='text'>A third has him withdrawn by his father for failing to improve his grades</span>
				<span class='text'>Whatever caused his premature departure, his parents were deeply dismayed and rued their failed plans for his future</span>

				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt;===Navy===With no viable career options, Bogart followed his passion for the sea and enlisted in the [[United States Navy]] in the spring of 1918</span>
				<span class='text'>He recalled later, &quot;At eighteen, war was great stuff</span>
				<span class='text'>Paris! Sexy French girls! Hot damn!&quot;&lt;ref name=Meyers_p19&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyers|1997|p=19</span>

				<span class='text'>7&quot;&gt;Sperber and Lax 1997, p</span>
				<span class='text'>27</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;It was during his naval stint that Bogart may have received his trademark scar and developed his characteristic lisp, though the actual circumstances are unclear</span>
				<span class='text'>In one account his lip was cut by shrapnel when his ship, the ''{{USS|Leviathan|ID-1326|6}}'', was shelled, although some claim Bogart did not make it to sea until after the Armistice had been signed</span>
				<span class='text'>Another version, which Bogart's long-time friend, author [[Nathaniel Benchley]], holds to, is that Bogart was injured while taking a prisoner to [[Portsmouth Naval Prison]] in [[Kittery, Maine]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Changing trains in Boston the handcuffed prisoner allegedly asked Bogart for a cigarette, then while Bogart looked for a match, the prisoner smashed him across the mouth with the cuffs, cutting Bogart's lip and fleeing</span>
				<span class='text'>Recaptured, the prisoner was taken to jail</span>
				<span class='text'>An alternate version has Bogart struck in the mouth by a handcuff loosened while freeing his charge, the other still round the prisoner's wrist</span>

				<span class='text'>2005, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>240–241</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;By the time Bogart was treated by a doctor, a scar had already formed</span>
				<span class='text'>[[David Niven]] said that when he first asked Bogart about his scar, he said it was caused by a childhood accident</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Goddamn doctor&quot;, Bogart later told Niven, &quot;instead of stitching it up, he screwed it up</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Niven claims the stories that Bogart got the scar during wartime were made up by the studios to inject glamour</span>
				<span class='text'>His post-service physical makes no mention of the lip scar, even though it mentions many smaller scars</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Sperber p</span>
				<span class='text'>7&quot;/&gt; When actress [[Louise Brooks]] met Bogart in 1924, he had some scar-tissue on his upper lip, which Brooks said that Bogart may have had partially repaired before entering films in 1930</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Meyers_p18-19/&gt; She believed his scar had nothing to do with his distinctive speech pattern, and said his &quot;lip wound gave him no speech impediment, either before or after it was mended</span>
				<span class='text'>Over the years, Bogart practiced all kinds of lip gymnastics, accompanied by nasal tones, snarls, lisps and slurs</span>
				<span class='text'>His painful wince, his leer, his fiendish grin were the most accomplished ever seen on film</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Sperber and Lax 1997, p</span>
				<span class='text'>28</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; During his naval days, Bogart's character and values developed independently of family influence, and he began to rebel somewhat against their values</span>
				<span class='text'>He came to be a liberal who hated pretensions, phonies, and snobs, and at times defied conventional behavior and authority, traits he displayed in both life and the movies</span>
				<span class='text'>He did not, however, forsake good manners, articulateness, punctuality, modesty, and a dislike of being touched</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Bogart was proud of his success, but the fact that it came from playing a [[gangster]] weighed on him</span>
				<span class='text'>He once said: &quot;I can't get in a mild discussion without turning it into an argument</span>

				<span class='text'>He advised [[Claire Trevor]], when she had been nominated for ''[[Key Largo (film)|Key Largo]]'', to &quot;just say you did it all yourself and don't thank anyone&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>But when Bogart won the Academy Award, which he truly coveted despite his well-advertised disdain for Hollywood, he said &quot;It's a long way from the Belgian Congo to the stage of this theatre</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Yet for all his success, Bogart was still his [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]] old self, grumbling and feuding with the studio, while his health was beginning to deteriorate</span>
				<span class='text'>The character of Queeg mirrored in some ways those Bogart had played in ''The Maltese Falcon'', ''Casablanca'' and ''The Big Sleep''&amp;ndash;the wary loner who trusts no one—but without either the warmth or humor of those roles</span>
				<span class='text'>Like his portrayal of Fred C</span>
				<span class='text'>Dobbs in ''The Treasure of the Sierra Madre'', Bogart played a paranoid, self-pitying character whose small-mindedness eventually destroyed him</span>
				<span class='text'>Three months before the film's release, Bogart appeared as Queeg on the cover of ''TIME'' magazine, while on Broadway [[Henry Fonda]] was starring in the stage version (in a different role), both of which generated strong publicity for the film</span>

				<span class='text'>Unable, he chose Bogart to play the elder, conservative brother who competes with his younger playboy sibling ([[William Holden]]) for the affection of the Cinderella-like Sabrina ([[Audrey Hepburn]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Bogart was lukewarm about the part, but agreed to it on a handshake with Wilder, sans finished script but with the director's assurances he would take good care of Bogart during the filming</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Meyers_p281&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyers|1997|p=281</span>

				<span class='text'>He complained about the script and its last-minute drafting and delivery, and accused Wilder of favoring Hepburn and Holden on and off the set</span>
				<span class='text'>At the root was Wilder being the opposite of Bogart's ideal director, John Huston, in both style and personality</span>
				<span class='text'>Bogart groused to the press that Wilder was &quot;overbearing&quot; and &quot;is the kind of [[Prussia]]n German with a riding crop</span>
