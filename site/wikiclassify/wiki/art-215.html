				<span class='text'>1343 – 25 October 1400), known as the Father of [[English literature]], is widely considered the greatest English poet of the [[Middle Ages]] and was the first poet to be buried in [[Poets' Corner]] of [[Westminster Abbey]]</span>
				<span class='text'>hile he achieved fame during his lifetime as an author, philosopher, and [[astronomer]], composing a scientific treatise on the [[astrolabe]] for his ten-year-old son Lewis, Chaucer also maintained an active career in the civil service as a bureaucrat, [[Noble court|courtier]] and diplomat</span>
				<span class='text'>Among his many works, which include ''[[The Book of the Duchess]]'', the ''[[House of Fame]]'', the ''[[Legend of Good Women]]'' and ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>He is best known today for ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>In the City Hustings Roll 110, 5, Ric II, dated June 1380, Geoffrey Chaucer refers to himself as ''me Galfridum Chaucer, filium Johannis Chaucer, Vinetarii, Londonie' ''</span>
				<span class='text'>hile records concerning the lives of his contemporary poets, [[William Langland]] and the [[Pearl Poet]] are practically non-existent, since Chaucer was a public servant, his official life is very well documented, with nearly five hundred written items testifying to his career</span>
				<span class='text'>The first of the &quot;Chaucer Life Records&quot; appears in 1357, in the household accounts of [[Elizabeth de Burgh, 4th Countess of Ulster|Elizabeth de Burgh]], the [[Earl of Ulster|Countess of Ulster]], when he became the noblewoman's page through his father's connections,&lt;ref&gt;Skeat (1899); Vol</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1360, he was captured during the siege of [[Rheims]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Edward paid £16 for his ransom,&lt;ref&gt;''Chaucer Life Records'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>24&lt;/ref&gt; a considerable sum, and Chaucer was released</span>
				<span class='text'>fter this, Chaucer's life is uncertain, but he seems to have travelled in France, Spain, and [[Flanders]], possibly as a messenger and perhaps even going on a pilgrimage to [[Santiago de Compostela]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Around 1366, Chaucer married [[Philippa (de) Roet]]</span>
				<span class='text'>She was a lady-in-waiting to Edward III's queen, [[Philippa of Hainault]], and a sister of [[Katherine Swynford]], who later (c</span>
				<span class='text'>1396) became the third wife of [[John of Gaunt]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It is uncertain how many children Chaucer and Philippa had, but three or four are most commonly cited</span>
				<span class='text'>His son, [[Thomas Chaucer]], had an illustrious career, as [[Chief Butler of England|chief butler]] to four kings, envoy to France, and [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker of the House of Commons]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;According to tradition, Chaucer studied law in the [[Inner Temple]] (an [[Inn of Court]]) at this time</span>
				<span class='text'>He became a member of the royal court of Edward III as a ''[[varlet de chambre]]'', [[yeoman]], or [[esquire]] on 20 June 1367, a position which could entail a wide variety of tasks</span>
				<span class='text'>His wife also received a pension for court employment</span>
				<span class='text'>He travelled abroad many times, at least some of them in his role as a valet</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1368, he may have attended the wedding of [[Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence|Lionel of Antwerp]] to [[Violante Visconti]], daughter of [[Galeazzo II Visconti]], in [[Milan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Two other literary stars of the era were in attendance: [[Jean Froissart]] and [[Petrarch]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Later documents suggest it was a mission, along with Jean Froissart, to arrange a marriage between the future King [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] and a French princess, thereby ending the [[Hundred Years War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>If this was the purpose of their trip, they seem to have been unsuccessful, as no wedding occurred</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1378, Richard II sent Chaucer as an envoy (secret dispatch) to the Visconti and to Sir [[John Hawkwood]], English [[condottiere]] (mercenary leader) in [[Milan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It has been speculated that it was Hawkwood on whom Chaucer based his character the Knight in the ''Canterbury Tales'', for a description matches that of a 14th-century condottiere</span>
				<span class='text'>[Image:Geoffrey Chaucer</span>
				<span class='text'>peg|left|thumb|A 19th-century depiction of Chaucer]]A possible indication that his career as a writer was appreciated came when [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] granted Chaucer &quot;a gallon of wine daily for the rest of his life&quot; for some unspecified task</span>
				<span class='text'>This was an unusual grant, but given on a day of celebration, [[St George's Day]], 1374, when artistic endeavours were traditionally rewarded, it is assumed to have been another early poetic work</span>
				<span class='text'>It is not known which, if any, of Chaucer's extant works prompted the reward, but the suggestion of him as poet to a king places him as a precursor to later [[poets laureate]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Chaucer continued to collect the liquid stipend until Richard II came to power, after which it was converted to a monetary grant on 18 April 1378</span>
				<span class='text'>haucer obtained the very substantial job of [[comptroller]] of the customs for the port of London, which he began on 8 June 1374</span>

				<span class='text'>His life goes undocumented for much of the next ten years, but it is believed that he wrote (or began) most of his famous works during this period</span>
				<span class='text'>He was mentioned in law papers of 4 May 1380, involved in the ''raptus'' of Cecilia Chaumpaigne</span>
				<span class='text'>What ''raptus'' means is unclear, but the incident seems to have been resolved quickly and did not leave a stain on Chaucer's reputation</span>
				<span class='text'>It is not known if Chaucer was in the city of London at the time of the [[Peasants' Revolt]], but if he was, he would have seen its leaders pass almost directly under his apartment window at [[Aldgate]]</span>

				<span class='text'>He is thought to have started work on ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' in the early 1380s</span>
				<span class='text'>He also became a Member of Parliament for Kent in 1386</span>

				<span class='text'>He survived the political upheavals caused by the [[Lords Appellant]]s, despite the fact that Chaucer knew some of the men executed over the affair quite well</span>
				<span class='text'>n 12 July 1389, Chaucer was appointed the [[Clerk of the Works|clerk of the king's works]], a sort of [[Construction foreman|foreman]] organising most of the king's building projects</span>

				<span class='text'>5, p</span>
				<span class='text'>245</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; No major works were begun during his tenure, but he did conduct repairs on [[Westminster Palace]], [[St</span>
				<span class='text'>George's Chapel, Windsor]], continue building the wharf at the [[Tower of London]], and build the stands for a tournament held in 1390</span>
				<span class='text'>It may have been a difficult job, but it paid well: two [[shilling]]s a day, more than three times his salary as a comptroller</span>
				<span class='text'>Chaucer was also appointed keeper of the lodge at the King’s park in [[Feckenham Forest|Feckenham]], which was a largely honorary appointment</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Forest of Feckenham, John Humphreys FSA, in Birmingham and Warwickshire Archaeology Society's Transactions and proceedings, Volumes 44–45 p117&lt;/ref&gt;In September 1390, records say that he was robbed, and possibly injured, while conducting the business, and it was shortly after, on 17 June 1391, that he stopped working in this capacity</span>
				<span class='text'>Almost immediately, on 22 June, he began as Deputy [[Forester]] in the [[royal forest]] of [[Petherton Park]] in [[North Petherton]], Somerset</span>
				<span class='text'>This was no [[sinecure]], with maintenance an important part of the job, although there were many opportunities to derive profit</span>
				<span class='text'>He was granted an annual pension of twenty pounds by Richard II in 1394</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ward, p</span>
				<span class='text'>109</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that Chaucer stopped work on the ''Canterbury Tales'' sometime towards the end of this decade</span>
				<span class='text'>ot long after the overthrow of his patron, Richard II, in 1399, Chaucer's name fades from the historical record</span>
				<span class='text'>The last few records of his life show his pension renewed by the new king, and his taking of a lease on a residence within the [[Close of the Collegiate Church of St Peter|close of Westminster Abbey]] on 24 December 1399</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Morley (1890); Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>V, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>247–48</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] renewed the grants assigned to Chaucer by Richard, Chaucer's own ''The Complaint of Chaucer to his Purse'' hints that the grants might not have been paid</span>
				<span class='text'>The last mention of Chaucer is on 5 June 1400, when some monies owed to him were paid</span>
				<span class='text'>e is believed to have died of unknown causes on 25 October 1400, but there is no firm evidence for this date, as it comes from the engraving on his tomb, erected more than one hundred years after his death</span>
				<span class='text'>There is some speculation—most recently in [[Terry Jones]]' book ''[[Who Murdered Chaucer? : A Medieval Mystery]]''—that he was murdered by enemies of Richard II or even on the orders of his successor Henry IV, but the case is entirely circumstantial</span>
				<span class='text'>Chaucer was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]] in London, as was his right owing to his status as a tenant of the Abbey's close</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1556, his remains were transferred to a more ornate tomb, making Chaucer the first writer interred in the area now known as [[Poets' Corner]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==Relationship to John of Gaunt===Chaucer was a close friend of and served under the patronage of [[John of Gaunt]], the wealthy [[Duke of Lancaster]] (and father of the future [[Henry IV of England|King of England]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Near the end of their lives Lancaster and Chaucer became brothers-in-law</span>
				<span class='text'>Chaucer married [[Philippa (de) Roet|Philippa (Pan) de Roet]] in 1366, and Lancaster took his mistress of nearly 30 years, [[Katherine Swynford|Katherine Swynford (de Roet)]], who was Philippa Chaucer's sister, as his third wife in 1396</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Philippa died c</span>
				<span class='text'>387, the men were bound as brothers and Lancaster's children by Katherine—John, Henry, Thomas and Joan [[House of Beaufort|Beaufort]]—were Chaucer's nephews and niece</span>

				<span class='text'>The poem refers to John and Blanche in [[allegory]] as the narrator relates the tale of &quot;A long castel with walles white/Be Seynt Johan, on a ryche hil&quot; (1318–1319) who is mourning grievously after the death of his love, &quot;And goode faire White she het/That was my lady name ryght&quot; (948–949)</span>
				<span class='text'>The phrase &quot;long castel&quot; is a reference to Lancaster (also called &quot;Loncastel&quot; and &quot;Longcastell&quot;), &quot;walles white&quot; is thought to likely be an oblique reference to Blanche, &quot;Seynt Johan&quot; was John of Gaunt's name-saint, and &quot;ryche hil&quot; is a reference to Richmond; these thinly veiled references reveal the identity of the grieving black knight of the poem as John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster and Earl of Richmond</span>

				<span class='text'>[[Fortuna|''Fortune'']], in turn, does not understand Chaucer's harsh words to her for she believes she has been kind to him, claims that he does not know what she has in store for him in the future, but most importantly, &quot;And eek thou hast thy beste frend alyve&quot; (32, 40, 48)</span>
				<span class='text'>Chaucer retorts that &quot;My frend maystow nat reven, blind goddesse&quot; (50) and orders her to take away those who merely pretend to be his friends</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Fortuna|''Fortune'']] turns her attention to three princes whom she implores to relieve Chaucer of his pain and &quot;Preyeth his beste frend of his noblesse/That to som beter estat he may atteyne&quot; (78–79)</span>
				<span class='text'>The three princes are believed to represent the dukes of Lancaster, [[Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York|York]], and [[Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester|Gloucester]], and a portion of line 76, &quot;as three of you or tweyne,&quot; to refer to the ordinance of 1390 which specified that no royal gift could be authorised without the consent of at least two of the three dukes</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Gross, Zaila 1987 635&quot;/&gt; Most conspicuous in this short poem is the number of references to Chaucer's &quot;beste frend&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Fortuna|''Fortune'']] states three times in her response to the plaintiff, &quot;And also, you still have your best friend alive&quot; (32, 40, 48); she also references his &quot;beste frend&quot; in the envoy when appealing to his &quot;noblesse&quot; to help Chaucer to a higher estate</span>
				<span class='text'>A fifth reference is made by &quot;Chaucer as narrator&quot; who rails at [[Fortuna|''Fortune'']] that she shall not take his friend from him</span>
				<span class='text'>While the envoy playfully hints to Lancaster that Chaucer would certainly appreciate a boost to his status or income, the poem ''Fortune'' distinctively shows his deep appreciation and affection for John of Gaunt</span>

				<span class='text'>1400]]Chaucer's first major work, ''[[The Book of the Duchess]]'', was an elegy for [[Blanche of Lancaster]] (who died in 1369)</span>
				<span class='text'>It is possible that this work was commissioned by her husband John of Gaunt, as he granted Chaucer a £10 annuity on 13 June 1374</span>
				<span class='text'>This would seem to place the writing of ''The Book of the Duchess'' between the years 1369 and 1374</span>
				<span class='text'>Two other early works by Chaucer were ''[[Anelida and Arcite]]'' and ''[[The House of Fame]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Chaucer wrote many of his major works in a prolific period when he held the job of customs comptroller for London (1374 to 1386)</span>
				<span class='text'>His ''[[Parlement of Foules]]'', ''[[The Legend of Good Women]]'' and ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'' all date from this time</span>
				<span class='text'>It is believed that in the early 1380s he started the work for which he is best known - ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' a collection of stories told by fictional pilgrims on the road to the cathedral at [[Canterbury]]; tales that would help to shape English literature</span>
				<span class='text'>'The Canterbury Tales'' contrasts with other literature of the period in the naturalism of its narrative, the variety of stories the pilgrims tell and the varied characters who are engaged in the pilgrimage</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of the stories narrated by the pilgrims seem to fit their individual characters and social standing, although some of the stories seem ill-fitting to their narrators, perhaps as a result of the incomplete state of the work</span>
				<span class='text'>Chaucer drew on real life for his cast of pilgrims: the innkeeper shares the name of a contemporary keeper of an inn in Southwark, and real-life identities for the Wife of Bath, the Merchant, the Man of Law and the Student have been suggested</span>
				<span class='text'>The many jobs that Chaucer held in medieval society—page, soldier, messenger, valet, bureaucrat, foreman and administrator—probably exposed him to many of the types of people he depicted in the ''Tales''</span>
				<span class='text'>He was able to shape their speech and satirise their manners in what was to become popular literature among people of the same types</span>
				<span class='text'>haucer's works are sometimes grouped into first a French period, then an Italian period and finally an English period, with Chaucer being influenced by those countries' literatures in turn</span>
				<span class='text'>Certainly ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'' is a middle period work with its reliance on the forms of Italian poetry, little known in England at the time, but to which Chaucer was probably exposed during his frequent trips abroad on court business</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, its use of a [[classical antiquity|classical]] subject and its elaborate, courtly language sets it apart as one of his most complete and well-formed works</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''Troilus and Criseyde'' Chaucer draws heavily on his source, [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]], and on the late Latin philosopher [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]]</span>
				<span class='text'>However, it is ''The Canterbury Tales'', wherein he focuses on English subjects, with bawdy jokes and respected figures often being undercut with humour, that has cemented his reputation</span>
				<span class='text'>haucer also [[translation|translated]] such important works as Boethius' ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'' and ''[[Roman de la Rose|The Romance of the Rose]]'' by [[Guillaume de Lorris]] (extended by Jean de Meun)</span>
				<span class='text'>However, while many scholars maintain that Chaucer did indeed translate part of the text of ''Roman de la Rose'' as ''[[The Romaunt of the Rose]]'', others claim that this has been effectively disproved</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of his other works were very loose translations of, or simply based on, works from continental Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>It is in this role that Chaucer receives some of his earliest critical praise</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Eustache Deschamps]] wrote a ballade on the great translator and called himself a &quot;nettle in Chaucer's garden of poetry&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1385 [[Thomas Usk]] made glowing mention of Chaucer, and [[John Gower]], Chaucer's main poetic rival of the time, also lauded him</span>
				<span class='text'>This reference was later edited out of Gower's ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'' and it was suggested by one editor&lt;ref&gt; {{ cite book  | title=The Canterbury Tales of Chaucer | editor=Thomas Tyrwhitt | chapter=Introductory Discourse to the Canterbury Tales | page=126 note 15 | publisher=W</span>

				<span class='text'>ne other significant work of Chaucer's is his ''[[Treatise on the Astrolabe]]'', possibly for his own son, that describes the form and use of [[Astrolabe|that instrument]] in detail and is sometimes cited as the first example of [[technical writing]] in the English language</span>
				<span class='text'>Although much of the text may have come from other sources, the treatise indicates that Chaucer was versed in science in addition to his literary talents</span>
				<span class='text'>Another scientific work discovered in 1952, ''Equatorie of the Planetis'', has similar language and handwriting compared to some considered to be Chaucer's and it continues many of the ideas from the Astrolabe</span>
				<span class='text'>Furthermore, it contains an example of early European [[encryption]]</span>

				<span class='text'>ng|thumb|300px|Portrait of Chaucer from a manuscript by [[Thomas Hoccleve]], who may have met Chaucer]]Chaucer wrote in continental accentual-syllabic [[meter (poetry)|meter]], a style which had developed since around the 12th century as an alternative to the [[alliterative verse|alliterative]] Anglo-Saxon metre</span>

				<span class='text'>97</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Chaucer is known for metrical innovation, inventing the [[rhyme royal]], and he was one of the first English poets to use the five-stress line, a decasyllabic cousin to the [[iambic pentameter]], in his work, with only a few anonymous short works using it before him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[Marchette Gaylord Chute]], ''Geoffrey Chaucer of England'' E</span>
				<span class='text'>P</span>
				<span class='text'>Dutton, 1946, p</span>
				<span class='text'>89</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The arrangement of these five-stress lines into rhyming [[couplet]]s, first seen in his ''[[The Legend of Good Women]]'', was used in much of his later work and became one of the standard poetic forms in English</span>
				<span class='text'>His early influence as a satirist is also important, with the common humorous device, the funny accent of a regional [[dialect]], apparently making its first appearance in ''[[The Reeve's Tale]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>he poetry of Chaucer, along with other writers of the era, is credited with helping to standardise the London Dialect of the [[Middle English]] language from a combination of the Kentish and Midlands dialects</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Edwin Winfield Bowen, ''Questions at Issue in our English Speech'', NY: Broadway Publishing, 1909, p</span>
				<span class='text'>147</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This is probably overstated; the influence of the court, [[Lord Chancellor|chancery]] and bureaucracy—of which Chaucer was a part—remains a more probable influence on the development of [[Standard English]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Modern English]] is somewhat distanced from the language of Chaucer's poems owing to the effect of the [[Great Vowel Shift]] some time after his death</span>
				<span class='text'>This change in the [[pronunciation]] of English, still not fully understood, makes the reading of Chaucer difficult for the modern audience</span>
				<span class='text'>The status of the final ''-e'' in Chaucer's verse is uncertain: it seems likely that during the period of Chaucer's writing the final ''-e'' was dropping out of colloquial English and that its use was somewhat irregular</span>
				<span class='text'>Chaucer's versification suggests that the final ''-e'' is sometimes to be vocalised, and sometimes to be silent; however, this remains a point on which there is disagreement</span>
				<span class='text'>When it is vocalised, most scholars pronounce it as a [[schwa]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Apart from the irregular spelling, much of the vocabulary is recognisable to the modern reader</span>
				<span class='text'>Chaucer is also recorded in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' as the first author to use many common English words in his writings</span>
				<span class='text'>These words were probably frequently used in the language at the time but Chaucer, with his ear for common speech, is the earliest extant manuscript source</span>
				<span class='text'>''Acceptable'', ''alkali'', ''altercation'', ''amble'', ''angrily'', ''annex'', ''annoyance'', ''approaching'', ''arbitration'', ''armless'', ''army'', ''arrogant'', ''arsenic'', ''arc'', ''artillery'' and ''aspect'' are just some of the many [[English words first attested in Chaucer]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==Literary===Widespread knowledge of Chaucer's works is attested by the many poets who imitated or responded to his writing</span>
				<span class='text'>[[John Lydgate]] was one of the earliest poets to write continuations of Chaucer's unfinished ''Tales'' while [[Robert Henryson]]'s ''Testament of Cresseid'' completes the story of [[Cressida]] left unfinished in his ''Troilus and Criseyde''</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of the manuscripts of Chaucer's works contain material from these poets and later appreciations by the [[romantic era]] poets were shaped by their failure to distinguish the later &quot;additions&quot; from original Chaucer</span>
				<span class='text'>Writers or the 17th and 18th centuries, such as [[John Dryden]], admired Chaucer for his stories, but not for his rhythm and rhyme, as few critics could then read Middle English and the text had been butchered by printers, leaving a somewhat unadmirable mess</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the late 19th century that the official Chaucerian canon, accepted today, was decided upon, largely as a result of [[Walter William Skeat]]'s work</span>
				<span class='text'>Roughly seventy-five years after Chaucer's death, ''The Canterbury Tales'' was selected by [[William Caxton]] to be one of the first books to be printed in England</span>
				<span class='text'>==English===Chaucer is sometimes considered the source of the English vernacular tradition</span>
				<span class='text'>His achievement for the language can be seen as part of a general historical trend towards the creation of a [[vernacular literature]], after the example of [[Dante]], in many parts of Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>A parallel trend in Chaucer's own lifetime was underway in Scotland through the work of his slightly earlier contemporary, [[John Barbour (poet)|John Barbour]], and was likely to have been even more general, as is evidenced by the example of the [[Pearl Poet]] in the north of England</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough Chaucer's language is much closer to Modern English than the text of ''[[Beowulf]]'', such that (unlike that of ''Beowulf'') a Modern English-speaker with a large vocabulary of archaic words may understand it, it differs enough that most publications modernise his idiom</span>
				<span class='text'>The following is a sample from the prologue of ''[[The Summoner's Tale]]'' that compares Chaucer's text to a modern translation:{| cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;white-space: nowrap;&quot;| || ''Original Text'' || ''Modern Translation''|-| || This frere bosteth that he knoweth helle,| This friar boasts that he knows hell,|-| || And God it woot, that it is litel wonder;| And God knows that it is little wonder;|-| || Freres and feendes been but lyte asonder</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;As noted by Carolyn Collette in &quot;Fifteenth Century Chaucer&quot;, an essay published in the book ''A Companion to Chaucer'' ISBN 0-631-23590-6&lt;/ref&gt; Around two centuries later, Sir [[Philip Sidney]] greatly praised ''Troilus and Criseyde'' in his own ''Defence of Poesie''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;&quot;Chawcer undoubtedly did excellently in his Troilus and Creseid: of whome trulie I knowe not whether to mervaile more, either that hee in that mistie time could see so clearly, or that wee in this cleare age, goe so stumblingly after him</span>

				<span class='text'>du]&lt;/ref&gt;===Manuscripts and audience===The large number of surviving manuscripts of Chaucer's works is testimony to the enduring interest in his poetry prior to the arrival of the printing press</span>
				<span class='text'>There are 83 surviving manuscripts of the Canterbury Tales (in whole or part) alone, along with sixteen of ''Troilus and Criseyde'', including the personal copy of [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Benson, Larry, ''The Riverside Chaucer'' (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1987), p</span>
				<span class='text'>1118</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Given the ravages of time, it is likely that these surviving manuscripts represent hundreds since lost</span>
				<span class='text'>Chaucer's original audience was a courtly one, and would have included women as well as men of the upper social classes</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet even before his death in 1400, Chaucer's audience had begun to include members of the rising literate, middle and merchant classes, which included many [[Lollard]] sympathisers who may well have been inclined to read Chaucer as one of their own, particularly in his satirical writings about friars, priests, and other church officials</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1464, John Baron, a tenant farmer in [[Agmondesham]], was brought before [[John Chadworth]], the Bishop of Lincoln, on charges he was a Lollard heretic; he confessed to owning a &quot;boke of the Tales of Caunterburie&quot; among other suspect volumes</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Printed editions===[[William Caxton]], the first English printer, was responsible for the first two folio editions of ''The Canterbury Tales'' which were published in 1478 and 1483</span>

				<span class='text'>du/Library/special/exhibits/clastext/clspg076</span>
				<span class='text'>tm A Leaf from The Canterbury Tales</span>
				<span class='text'>Westminster, England: William Caxton, [1478&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt; Caxton's second printing, by his own account, came about because a customer complained that the printed text differed from a manuscript he knew; Caxton obligingly used the man's manuscript as his source</span>
				<span class='text'>Both Caxton editions carry the equivalent of manuscript authority</span>
				<span class='text'>Caxton's edition was reprinted by his successor, [[Wynkyn de Worde]], but this edition has no independent authority</span>
				<span class='text'>[Richard Pynson]], the [[King's Printer]] under Henry VIII for about twenty years, was the first to collect and sell something that resembled an edition of the collected works of Chaucer, introducing in the process five previously printed texts that we now know are not Chaucer's</span>
				<span class='text'>(The collection is actually three separately printed texts, or collections of texts, bound together as one volume</span>
				<span class='text'> There is a likely connection between Pynson's product and [[William Thynne]]'s a mere six years later</span>
				<span class='text'>Thynne had a successful career from the 1520s until his death in 1546, when he was one of the masters of the royal household</span>
				<span class='text'>His editions of ''Chaucers Works'' in 1532 and 1542 were the first major contributions to the existence of a widely recognised Chaucerian canon</span>
				<span class='text'>Thynne represents his edition as a book sponsored by and supportive of the king who is praised in the preface by [[Sir Brian Tuke]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Thynne's canon brought the number of apocryphal works associated with Chaucer to a total of 28, even if that was not his intention</span>
				<span class='text'>As with Pynson, once included in the ''Works'', [[Pseudepigraphy|pseudepigraphic]] texts stayed within it, regardless of their first editor's intentions</span>
				<span class='text'>n the 16th and 17th centuries, Chaucer was printed more than any other English author, and he was the first author to have his works collected in comprehensive single-volume editions in which a Chaucer [[wiktionary:canon|canon]] began to cohere</span>
				<span class='text'>Some scholars contend that 16th-century editions of Chaucer's ''Works'' set the precedent for all other English authors in terms of presentation, prestige and success in print</span>
				<span class='text'>These editions certainly established Chaucer's reputation, but they also began the complicated process of reconstructing and frequently inventing Chaucer's biography and the canonical list of works which were attributed to him</span>
				<span class='text'>robably the most significant aspect of the growing apocrypha is that, beginning with Thynne's editions, it began to include medieval texts that made Chaucer appear as a proto-Protestant [[Lollard]], primarily the ''[[Testament of Love]]'' and ''[[The Plowman's Tale]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>As &quot;Chaucerian&quot; works that were not considered apocryphal until the late 19th century, these medieval texts enjoyed a new life, with English Protestants carrying on the earlier Lollard project of appropriating existing texts and authors who seemed sympathetic—or malleable enough to be construed as sympathetic—to their cause</span>
				<span class='text'>The official Chaucer of the early printed volumes of his ''Works'' was construed as a proto-Protestant as the same was done, concurrently, with [[William Langland]] and ''[[Piers Plowman]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The famous ''Plowman's Tale'' did not enter Thynne's ''Works'' until the second, 1542, edition</span>
				<span class='text'>Its entry was surely facilitated by Thynne's inclusion of [[Thomas Usk]]'s ''Testament of Love'' in the first edition</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''Testament of Love'' imitates, borrows from, and thus resembles Usk's contemporary, Chaucer</span>
				<span class='text'>(''Testament of Love'' also appears to borrow from ''Piers Plowman''</span>
				<span class='text'> Since the ''Testament of Love'' mentions its author's part in a failed plot (book 1, chapter 6), his imprisonment, and (perhaps) a recantation of (possibly Lollard) heresy, all this was associated with Chaucer</span>
				<span class='text'>(Usk himself was executed as a traitor in 1388</span>
				<span class='text'> Interestingly, [[John Foxe]] took this recantation of heresy as a defence of the true faith, calling Chaucer a &quot;right Wiclevian&quot; and (erroneously) identifying him as a schoolmate and close friend of [[John Wycliffe]] at [[Merton College, Oxford]]</span>
				<span class='text'>([[s:Speght, Thomas (DNB00)|Thomas Speght]] is careful to highlight these facts in his editions and his &quot;Life of Chaucer</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;) No other sources for the ''Testament of Love'' exist—there is only Thynne's construction of whatever manuscript sources he had</span>

				<span class='text'>[Image:Chaucer 1602</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Engraving of Chaucer from [[Thomas Speght|Speght's]] edition]]In his 1598 edition of the ''Works'', Speght (probably taking cues from Foxe) made good use of Usk's account of his political intrigue and imprisonment in the ''Testament of Love'' to assemble a largely fictional &quot;Life of Our Learned English Poet, Geffrey Chaucer</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Speght's &quot;Life&quot; presents readers with an erstwhile radical in troubled times much like their own, a proto-Protestant who eventually came around the king's views on religion</span>
				<span class='text'>Speght states that &quot;In the second year of Richard the second, the King tooke Geffrey Chaucer and his lands into his protection</span>
				<span class='text'>The occasion wherof no doubt was some daunger and trouble whereinto he was fallen by favouring some rash attempt of the common people</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Under the discussion of Chaucer's friends, namely John of Gaunt, Speght further explains:::Yet it seemeth that [Chaucer] was in some trouble in the daies of King Richard the second, as it may appeare in the Testament of Loue: where hee doth greatly complaine of his owne rashnesse in following the multitude, and of their hatred of him for bewraying their purpose</span>
				<span class='text'>And in that complaint which he maketh to his empty purse, I do find a written copy, which I had of Iohn Stow (whose library hath helped many writers) wherein ten times more is adjoined, then is in print</span>
				<span class='text'>Where he maketh great lamentation for his wrongfull imprisonment, wishing death to end his daies: which in my iudgement doth greatly accord with that in the Testament of Love</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover we find it thus in Record</span>
				<span class='text'>ater, in &quot;The [[Argument (literature)|Argument]]&quot; to the ''Testament of Love'', Speght adds:::Chaucer did compile this booke as a comfort to himselfe after great griefs conceiued for some rash attempts of the commons, with whome he had ioyned, and thereby was in feare to loose the fauour of his best friends</span>
				<span class='text'>peght is also the source of the famous tale of Chaucer being fined for beating a [[Franciscan]] [[friar]] in [[Fleet Street]], as well as a fictitious [[coat of arms]] and [[family tree]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Ironically—and perhaps consciously so—an introductory, apologetic letter in Speght's edition from [[Francis Beaumont]] defends the unseemly, &quot;low&quot;, and bawdy bits in Chaucer from an elite, classicist position</span>
				<span class='text'>Francis Thynne noted some of these inconsistencies in his ''Animadversions'', insisting that Chaucer was not a commoner, and he objected to the friar-beating story</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet Thynne himself underscores Chaucer's support for popular religious reform, associating Chaucer's views with his father William Thynne's attempts to include ''The Plowman's Tale'' and ''The Pilgrim's Tale'' in the 1532 and 1542 ''Works''</span>
				<span class='text'>he myth of the Protestant Chaucer continues to have a lasting impact on a large body of Chaucerian scholarship</span>
				<span class='text'>Though it is extremely rare for a modern scholar to suggest Chaucer supported a religious movement that didn't exist until more than a century after his death, the predominance of this thinking for so many centuries left it for granted that Chaucer was at least hostile toward Catholicism</span>
				<span class='text'>This assumption forms a large part of many critical approaches to Chaucer's works, including neo-Marxism</span>
				<span class='text'>longside Chaucer's ''Works'', the most impressive literary monument of the period is [[John Foxe]]'s ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs|Acts and Monuments</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>]''</span>
				<span class='text'>As with the Chaucer editions, it was critically significant to English Protestant identity and included Chaucer in its project</span>
				<span class='text'>Foxe's Chaucer both derived from and contributed to the printed editions of Chaucer's ''Works'', particularly the pseudepigrapha</span>
				<span class='text'>''Jack Upland'' was first printed in Foxe's ''Acts and Monuments'', and then it appeared in Speght's edition of Chaucer's ''Works''</span>
				<span class='text'>Speght's &quot;Life of Chaucer&quot; echoes Foxe's own account, which is itself dependent upon the earlier editions that added the ''Testament of Love'' and ''The Plowman's Tale'' to their pages</span>
				<span class='text'>Like Speght's Chaucer, Foxe's Chaucer was also a shrewd (or lucky) political survivor</span>
				<span class='text'>In his 1563 edition, Foxe &quot;thought it not out of season </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>to couple </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>some mention of Geoffrey Chaucer&quot; with a discussion of [[John Colet]], a possible source for [[John Skelton]]'s character [[Colin Clout]]</span>
				<span class='text'>robably referring to the 1542 [[Act for the Advancement of True Religion]], Foxe said that he &quot;marvel[s] to consider </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>how the bishops, condemning and abolishing all manner of English books and treatises which might bring the people to any light of knowledge, did yet authorise the works of Chaucer to remain still and to be occupied; who, no doubt, saw into religion as much almost as even we do now, and uttereth in his works no less, and seemeth to be a right Wicklevian, or else there never was any</span>
				<span class='text'>And that, all his works almost, if they be thoroughly advised, will testify (albeit done in mirth, and covertly); and especially the latter end of his third book of the Testament of Love </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Wherein, except a man be altogether blind, he may espy him at the full: although in the same book (as in all others he useth to do), under shadows covertly, as under a visor, he suborneth truth in such sort, as both privily she may profit the godly-minded, and yet not be espied of the crafty adversary</span>
				<span class='text'>And therefore the bishops, belike, taking his works but for jests and toys, in condemning other books, yet permitted his books to be read</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;It is significant, too, that Foxe's discussion of Chaucer leads into his history of &quot;The Reformation of the Church of Christ in the Time of Martin Luther&quot; when &quot;Printing, being opened, incontinently ministered unto the church the instruments and tools of learning and knowledge; which were good books and authors, which before lay hid and unknown</span>
				<span class='text'>The science of printing being found, immediately followed the grace of God; which stirred up good wits aptly to conceive the light of knowledge and judgment: by which light darkness began to be espied, and ignorance to be detected; truth from error, religion from superstition, to be discerned</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;Foxe downplays Chaucer's bawdy and amorous writing, insisting that it all testifies to his piety</span>
				<span class='text'>Material that is troubling is deemed metaphoric, while the more forthright satire (which Foxe prefers) is taken literally</span>
				<span class='text'>[Image:Chaucer1721</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Spine and Titlepage of the 1721 [[John Urry (literary editor)|John Urry edition]] of Chaucer's complete works]][[John Urry (literary editor)|John Urry]] produced the first edition of the complete works of Chaucer in a Latin font, published posthumously in 1721</span>
				<span class='text'>Included were several tales, according to the editors, for the first time printed, a biography of Chaucer, a glossary of old English words, and testimonials of author writers concerning Chaucer dating back to the 16th century</span>
				<span class='text'>According to A</span>
				<span class='text'>S</span>
				<span class='text'>G Edwards, &quot;This was the first collected edition of Chaucer to be printed in roman type</span>
				<span class='text'>The life of Chaucer prefixed to the volume was the work of the Reverend [[John Dart]], corrected and revised by Timothy Thomas</span>
				<span class='text'>The glossary appended was also mainly compiled by Thomas</span>
				<span class='text'>The text of Urry's edition has often been criticised by subsequent editors for its frequent conjectural emendations, mainly to make it conform to his sense of Chaucer's metre</span>
				<span class='text'>The justice of such criticisms should not obscure his achievement</span>
				<span class='text'>His is the first edition of Chaucer for nearly a hundred and fifty years to consult any manuscripts and is the first since that of William Thynne in 1534 to seek systematically to assemble a substantial number of manuscripts to establish his text</span>
				<span class='text'>It is also the first edition to offer descriptions of the manuscripts of Chaucer's works, and the first to print texts of 'Gamelyn' and 'The Tale of Beryn', works ascribed to, but not by, Chaucer</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;===Modern scholarship===Although Chaucer's works had long been admired, serious scholarly work on his legacy did not begin until the late 18th century, when [[Thomas Tyrwhitt]] edited ''The Canterbury Tales'', and it did not become an established academic discipline until the 19th century</span>

				<span class='text'>The plot of the detective novel ''Landscape with Dead Dons'' by [[Robert Robinson (broadcaster)|Robert Robinson]] centres on the apparent rediscovery of ''The Book of the Leoun'', and a passage from it (eleven lines of good Chaucerian pastiche) turn out to be the vital murder clue as well as proving that the &quot;rediscovered&quot; poem is an elaborate, clever forgery by the murderer (a Chaucer scholar)</span>

				<span class='text'>The similar ''[[Treatise on the Astrolabe]]'', not usually doubted as Chaucer's work, in addition to Chaucer's name as a gloss to the manuscript are the main pieces of evidence for the ascription to Chaucer</span>
