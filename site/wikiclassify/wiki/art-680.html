				<span class='text'>Morton is also notable for naming and popularizing the &quot;[[Spanish Tinge]]&quot; ([[habanera (music)|habanera rhythm]] and [[tresillo (rhythm)|tresillo]]), and for writing such [[jazz standard|standards]] as &quot;[[King Porter Stomp]]&quot;, &quot;[[Wolverine Blues (Jelly Roll Morton)|Wolverine Blues]]&quot;, &quot;[[Black Bottom Stomp]]&quot;, and &quot;I Thought I Heard [[Buddy Bolden]] Say&quot;, the last a tribute to New Orleans musicians from the turn of the 20th century</span>
				<span class='text'>otorious for his arrogance and self-promotion as often as recognized in his day for his musical talents, Morton claimed to have invented jazz outright in 1902—much to the derision of later musicians and critics</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Critic [{{Allmusic|class=artis1t|id=p7181/biography|pure_url=yes}} Scott Yanow] writes, &quot;Jelly Roll Morton did himself a lot of harm posthumously by exaggerating his worth, claiming to have invented jazz in 1902</span>
				<span class='text'>Morton's accomplishments as an early innovator are so vast that he did not really need to stretch the truth</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The jazz historian, musician, and composer [[Gunther Schuller]] says of Morton's &quot;hyperbolic assertions&quot; that there is &quot;no proof to the contrary&quot; and that Morton's &quot;considerable accomplishments in themselves provide reasonable substantiation&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>In May 1938, Lomax invited Morton to record music and interviews for the [[Library of Congress]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The sessions, originally intended as a short interview with musical examples for use by music researchers in the Library of Congress, soon expanded to record more than eight hours of Morton talking and playing piano</span>
				<span class='text'>Lomax also conducted longer interviews during which he took notes but did not record</span>

				<span class='text'>Although reluctant to recount and record these, Morton eventually obliged Lomax</span>
				<span class='text'>Because of the suggestive nature of the songs, some of the Library of Congress recordings were not released until 2005</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Congress&quot; /&gt;In his interviews, Morton claimed to have been born in 1885</span>
				<span class='text'>He was aware that if he had been born in 1890, he would have been slightly too young to make a good case as the inventor of jazz</span>
				<span class='text'>He said in the interview that [[Buddy Bolden]] played [[ragtime]] but not jazz; this is not accepted by the consensus of Bolden's other New Orleans contemporaries</span>
				<span class='text'>The contradictions may stem from different definitions for the terms ''ragtime'' and ''jazz''</span>
				<span class='text'>These interviews, released in different forms over the years, were released on an eight-CD [[boxed set]] in 2005, ''[[The Complete Library of Congress Recordings]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>This collection won two [[Grammy Award]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Congress&quot; /&gt; The same year, Morton was honored with the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==Later years===When Morton was stabbed and wounded, a nearby [[racial segregation|whites-only]] hospital refused to treat him, as the city had racially segregated facilities</span>
				<span class='text'>He was transported to a black hospital farther away</span>
				<span class='text'>{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} When he was in the hospital, the doctors left ice on his wounds for several hours before attending to his eventually fatal injury</span>
				<span class='text'>His recovery from his wounds was incomplete, and thereafter he was often ill and easily became short of breath</span>
				<span class='text'>Morton made a new series of commercial recordings in New York, several recounting tunes from his early years that he discussed in his Library of Congress interviews</span>
				<span class='text'>{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}Worsening asthma sent him to a New York hospital for three months at one point</span>
				<span class='text'>He continued to suffer from respiratory problems when visiting [[Los Angeles]] with a series of manuscripts of new tunes and arrangements, planning to form a new band and restart his career</span>
				<span class='text'>Morton died on July 10, 1941, after an eleven-day stay in [[Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center|Los Angeles County General Hospital]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to the jazz historian David Gelly in 2000, Morton's arrogance and &quot;bumptious&quot; persona alienated so many musicians over the years that no colleagues or admirers attended his funeral</span>

				<span class='text'>The story notes the absence of Duke Ellington and Jimmie Lunceford, both of whom were appearing in Los Angeles at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>(The article is reproduced in Alan Lomax's biography of Morton, ''Mister Jelly Roll'', University of California Press, 1950</span>

				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}Morton often played the melody of a tune with his right thumb, while sounding a harmony above these notes with other fingers of the right hand</span>
				<span class='text'>This added a rustic or &quot;out-of-tune&quot; sound (due to the playing of a [[Diminished fifth|diminished 5th]] above the melody)</span>
