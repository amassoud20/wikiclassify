				<span class='text'>According to economist [[Robert Lekachman]], Keynes's &quot;nerve and mastery became legendary&quot; because of his performance of these duties, as in the case where he managed to assemble – with difficulty – a small supply of Spanish [[peseta]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>The secretary of the Treasury was delighted to hear Keynes had amassed enough to provide a temporary solution for the British Government</span>
				<span class='text'>But Keynes did not hand the pesetas over, choosing instead to sell them all to break the market: his boldness paid off, as pesetas then became much less scarce and expensive</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Keynes's colleague, David Lloyd George</span>
				<span class='text'>Keynes was initially wary of the &quot;Welsh Wizard,&quot; preferring his rival [[H</span>
				<span class='text'>H</span>
				<span class='text'>Asquith|Asquith]], but was impressed with Lloyd George at Versailles; this did not prevent Keynes from painting a scathing picture of the then-Prime Minister in his ''[[Economic Consequences of the Peace]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>]Keynes's experience at [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles]] was influential in shaping his future outlook, yet it was not a successful one for him</span>
				<span class='text'>Keynes's main interest had been in trying to prevent [[World War I reparations|Germany's compensation payments]] being set so high it would traumatise innocent German people, damage the nation's ability to pay and sharply limit her ability to buy exports from other countries – thus hurting not just Germany's own economy but that of the wider world</span>
				<span class='text'>Unfortunately for Keynes, conservative powers in the coalition that emerged from the [[United Kingdom general election, 1918|1918 coupon election]] were able to ensure that both Keynes himself and the Treasury were largely excluded from formal high-level talks concerning reparations</span>
				<span class='text'>Their place was taken by the [[Heavenly Twins (Sumner and Cunliffe)|Heavenly Twins]] – the judge [[John Hamilton, 1st Viscount Sumner|Lord Sumner]] and the banker [[Walter Cunliffe, 1st Baron Cunliffe|Lord Cunliffe]] whose nickname derived from the &quot;astronomically&quot; high war compensation they wanted to demand from Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>Keynes was forced to try to exert influence mostly from behind the scenes</span>
				<span class='text'>he three principal players at Versailles were Britain's Lloyd George, France's [[Georges Clemenceau|Clemenceau]] and America's [[Woodrow Wilson|President Wilson]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;origins&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first = Frank|last= McDonough|pages = 43–46|title = The Origins of the First and Second World Wars|year=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=1-4051-0664-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;It was only Lloyd George to whom Keynes had much direct access; until the 1918 election he had some sympathy with Keynes's view but while campaigning had found his speeches were only well received by the public if he promised to harshly punish Germany, and had therefore committed to extracting high payments</span>
				<span class='text'>Lloyd George did however win some loyalty from Keynes with his actions at the Paris conference by intervening against the French to ensure the dispatch of much-needed food supplies to German civilians</span>
				<span class='text'>Clemenceau also pushed for high reparations; generally France argued for an even more severe settlement than Britain</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilson initially favoured relatively lenient treatment of Germany – he feared too harsh conditions could foment the rise of extremism, and wanted Germany to be left sufficient capital to pay for imports</span>
				<span class='text'>To Keynes's dismay, Lloyd George and Clemenceau were able to pressure Wilson to agree to very high repayments being imposed</span>
				<span class='text'>Towards the end of the conference, Keynes came up with a plan that he argued would not only help Germany and other impoverished central European powers but also be good for the world economy as a whole</span>
				<span class='text'>It involved the writing down of war debts which would have the effect of increasing international trade all round</span>
				<span class='text'>Lloyd George agreed it might be acceptable to the British electorate</span>
				<span class='text'>However, America was against it; the US was then the largest creditor and by this time Wilson had started to believe in the merits of a harsh peace as a warning to future aggressors</span>
				<span class='text'>Hence despite his best efforts, the end result of the conference was a treaty which disgusted Keynes both on moral and economic grounds, and led to his resignation from the Treasury</span>

				<span class='text'>In addition to economic analysis, the book contained pleas to the reader's sense of [[compassion]]:{{quote|I cannot leave this subject as though its just treatment wholly depended either on our own pledges or on economic facts</span>
				<span class='text'>The policy of reducing Germany to servitude for a generation, of degrading the lives of millions of human beings, and of depriving a whole nation of happiness should be abhorrent and detestable, –abhorrent and detestable, even if it were possible, even if it enriched ourselves, even if it did not sow the decay of the whole civilised life of Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>}Also present was striking imagery such as &quot;year by year Germany must be kept impoverished and her children starved and crippled&quot; along with bold predictions which were later justified by events:  &lt;blockquote&gt;If we aim deliberately at the impoverishment of Central Europe, vengeance, I dare predict, will not limp</span>
				<span class='text'>Nothing can then delay for very long that final war between the forces of Reaction and the despairing convulsions of Revolution, before which the horrors of the late German war will fade into nothing</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/blockquote&gt;  Keynes's followers claim that his predictions of disaster were borne out when the German economy suffered the [[Inflation in the Weimar republic|hyperinflation of 1923]], and again by the collapse of the [[Weimar Republic]] and the outbreak of World War II</span>
				<span class='text'>However the historian [[Ruth Henig]] claims that &quot;most historians of the Paris peace conference now take the view that, in economic terms, the treaty was not unduly harsh on Germany and that, while obligations and damages were inevitably much stressed in the debates at Paris to satisfy electors reading the daily newspapers, the intention was quietly to give Germany substantial help towards paying her bills, and to meet many of the German objections by amendments to the way the reparations schedule was in practice carried out&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ruth Henig, ''Versailles and After: 1919–1933'' (London: Routledge, 1995), p</span>
				<span class='text'>65</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Sally Marks]] similarly claims that &quot;For nearly forty years, historians of twentieth-century diplomacy have argued that the Versailles treaty was more reasonable than its reputation suggests and that it did not of itself cause the Depression, the rise of Hitler, or World War II&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>632</span>
				<span class='text'>Marks also claims that the book is a &quot;brilliant but warped polemic&quot; (p</span>
				<span class='text'>636) that is &quot;long discredited by scholars&quot; and which Keynes regretted writing (p</span>
				<span class='text'>656)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Only a fraction of reparations were ever paid</span>
				<span class='text'>''The Economic Consequences of the Peace'' gained Keynes international fame, but also caused him to be regarded as anti-establishment – it was not until after the outbreak of World War II that Keynes was offered a directorship of a major British Bank, or an acceptable offer to return to government with a formal job</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Keynes was still able to influence government policy making through his network of contacts, his published works and by serving on government committees; this included attending high-level policy meetings as a consultant</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right| Keynes argued against a return to the [[gold standard]] at parity with pre-war sterling valuation after the [[Great War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>]Keynes had completed his ''[[A Treatise on Probability]]'' before the war, but published it in 1921</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Skidel20s&quot; /&gt; The work was a notable contribution to the philosophical and mathematical underpinnings of [[probability theory]], championing the important view that ''probabilities'' were no more or less than [[truth value]]s intermediate between simple truth and falsity</span>
				<span class='text'>Keynes developed the first upper-lower probabilistic [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] approach to probability in chapters 15 and 17 of this book, as well as having developed the first decision weight approach with his conventional coefficient of risk and weight, ''c'', in chapter 26</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition to his academic work, the 1920s saw Keynes active as a journalist selling his work internationally and working in London as a financial consultant</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1924 Keynes wrote an [[obituary]] for his former tutorAlfred Marshall which Schumpeter called &quot;the most brilliant life of a man of science I have ever read</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schumpeter|first=Joseph|title= Ten Great Economists|year=2003|page= 271|isbn=1-932512-09-8|publisher=Simon Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;Marshall's widow was &quot;entranced&quot; by the memorial, while Lytton Strachey rated it as one of Keynes's &quot;best works&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Skidel20s&quot; /&gt;In 1922 Keynes continued to advocate reduction of German reparations with ''A Revision of the Treaty''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Skidel20s&quot; /&gt; He attacked the post World War I deflation policies with ''A Tract on Monetary Reform'' in 1923&lt;ref name=&quot;Skidel20s&quot; /&gt; – a trenchant argument that countries should target stability of domestic prices, avoiding deflation even at the cost of allowing their currency to depreciate</span>
				<span class='text'>Britain suffered from high unemployment through most of the 1920s, leading Keynes to recommend the depreciation of [[Pound sterling|sterling]] to boost jobs by making British exports more affordable</span>
				<span class='text'>From 1924 he was also advocating a fiscal response, where the government could create jobs by spending on public works</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Skidel20s&quot; /&gt; During the 1920s Keynes's pro stimulus views had only limited effect on policy makers and mainstream academic opinion – according to Hyman Minsky one reason was that at this time his theoretical justification was &quot;muddled&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;Minksky&quot; /&gt; The ''Tract'' had also called for an end to the gold standard</span>
				<span class='text'>Keynes advised it was no longer a net benefit for countries such as Britain to participate in the [[gold standard]], as it ran counter to the need for domestic policy autonomy</span>
				<span class='text'>It could force countries to pursue deflationary policies at exactly the time when expansionary measures were called for to address rising unemployment</span>
				<span class='text'>The Treasury and Bank of England were still in favour of the gold standard and in 1925 they were able to convince the then Chancellor [[Winston Churchill]] to re-establish it, which had a depressing effect on British industry</span>
				<span class='text'>Keynes responded by writing ''The Economic Consequences of Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Churchill'' and continued to argue against the gold standard until Britain finally abandoned it in 1931</span>

				<span class='text'>The image is [[Dorothea Lange]]'s ''[[Migrant Mother]]'' depiction of destitute [[pea-pickers]] in California, taken in March 1936</span>
				<span class='text'>]Keynes had begun a theoretical work to examine the relationship between unemployment, money and prices back in the 1920s</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;50 greats&quot; /&gt; The work, ''[[A Treatise on Money|Treatise on Money]]'', was published in 1930 in two volumes</span>
				<span class='text'>A central idea of the work was that if the amount of money being saved exceeds the amount being invested – which can happen if interest rates are too high – then unemployment will rise</span>
				<span class='text'>This is in part a result of people not wanting to spend too high a proportion of what employers pay out, making it difficult, in aggregate, for employers to make a profit</span>
				<span class='text'>Another key theme of the book is the unreliability of financial [[index (economics)|indices]] for representing an accurate – or indeed meaningful – indication of general shifts in purchasing power of currencies over time</span>
				<span class='text'>In particular he criticised the justification of Britain's return to the [[Gold Standard]] in 1925 at pre-war valuation by reference to the [[wholesale price index]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He argued that the index understated the effects of changes in the costs of services and of labour</span>
				<span class='text'>eynes was deeply critical of the British government's austerity measures during the Great Depression</span>
				<span class='text'>He believed that budget deficits were a good thing, a product of recessions</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote, &quot;For Government borrowing of one kind or another is nature's remedy, so to speak, for preventing business losses from being, in so severe a slump as to present one, so great as to bring production altogether to a standstill</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;Skid30s&quot; /&gt; Apart from Great Britain, Keynes's attention was primarily focused on the United States</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;Minksky&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Skid30s&quot; /&gt; However, orthodox economic opinion remained generally hostile regarding fiscal intervention to mitigate the depression, until just before the outbreak of war</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;Minksky&quot;/&gt; In late 1933 Keynes was persuaded by [[Felix Frankfurter]] to address President Roosevelt directly, which he did by letters and face to face in 1934, after which the two men spoke highly of each other</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;Skid30s&quot;/&gt; However, according to Skidelsky, the consensus is that Keynes's efforts only began to have a more than marginal influence on US economic policy after 1939</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;Skid30s&quot;/&gt;Keynes's ''[[magnum opus]]'', ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]'' was published in 1936</span>

				<span class='text'>61&lt;/ref&gt; The work served as a theoretical justification for the interventionist policies Keynes favoured for tackling a recession</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''General Theory'' challenged the earlier [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical economic]] paradigm, which had held that provided it was unfettered by government interference, the market would naturally establish [[full employment]] equilibrium</span>
				<span class='text'>In doing so Keynes was partly setting himself against his former teachers Marshall and Pigou</span>
				<span class='text'>Keynes believed the classical theory was a &quot;special case&quot; that applied only to the particular conditions present in the 19th century, his own theory being the general one</span>
				<span class='text'>Classical economists had believed in [[Say's law]], which, simply put, states that &quot;[[supply creates its own demand]]&quot;, and that in a free market workers would always be willing to lower their wages to a level where employers could profitably offer them jobs</span>
				<span class='text'>An innovation from Keynes was the concept of [[Sticky (economics)|price stickiness]] – the recognition that in reality workers often refuse to lower their wage demands even in cases where a classical economist might argue it is [[rationality|rational]] for them to do so</span>
				<span class='text'>Due in part to price stickiness, it was established that the interaction of &quot;aggregate demand&quot; and &quot;aggregate supply&quot; may lead to stable unemployment equilibria – and in those cases, it is the state, and not the market, that economies must depend on for their salvation</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Keynes caricature Low 1934</span>

				<span class='text'>[[Aggregate demand]], which equals total un-hoarded income in a society, is defined by the sum of consumption and investment</span>
				<span class='text'>In a state of unemployment and unused production capacity, one can ''only'' enhance employment and total income by ''first'' increasing expenditures for either consumption or investment</span>

				<span class='text'>n [[The General Theory]] and later, Keynes responded to the socialists and left-wing liberals who argued, especially during the Depression of the 1930s, that capitalism caused war</span>
				<span class='text'>He argued that if capitalism were managed, domestically and internationally (with coordinated international Keynesian policies, an international monetary system that didn't pit the interests of countries against each other, and a high degree of freedom of trade), then this system of managed capitalism could promote peace rather than conflict between countries</span>
				<span class='text'>His plans during World War II for post-war international economic institutions and policies (which contributed to the creation at [[Bretton Woods Conference|Bretton Woods]] of the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]], and later to the creation of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] and eventually the [[World Trade Organization]]) were aimed to give effect to this vision</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Although Keynes has been widely criticised – especially by members of the [[Chicago School (economics)|Chicago School]] – for advocating irresponsible government spending financed by borrowing, in fact he was a firm believer in balanced budgets and regarded the proposals for programs of public works during the Depression as an exceptional measure to meet the needs of exceptional circumstances</span>

				<span class='text'>Compulsory saving would act to dampen domestic demand, assist in channelling additional output towards the war efforts, would be fairer than punitive taxation and would have the advantage of helping to avoid a post war slump by boosting demand once workers were allowed to withdraw their savings</span>

				<span class='text'>n the practical side of economic life, big government had appeared to be firmly entrenched in the 1950s but the balance began to shift towards private power in the 1960s</span>
				<span class='text'>Keynes had written against the folly of allowing &quot;decadent and selfish&quot; speculators and financiers the kind of influence they had enjoyed after World War I</span>
				<span class='text'>For two decades after World War II public opinion was strongly against private speculators, the disparaging label [[Gnomes of Zürich]] being typical of how they were described during this period</span>
				<span class='text'>International speculation was severely restricted by the capital controls in place after Bretton Woods</span>
				<span class='text'>Journalists [[Larry Elliott]] and [[Dan Atkinson]] say 1968 was a pivotal year when power shifted in the favour of private agents such as currency speculators</span>
				<span class='text'>They pick out a key 1968 event as being when America suspended the conversion of the dollar into gold except on request of foreign governments, which they identify as when the Bretton Woods system first began to break down</span>

				<span class='text'>Keynes himself had included few formulas and no explicit mathematical models in his General Theory</span>
				<span class='text'>For commentators such as economist [[Hyman Minsky]], Keynes's limited use of mathematics was partly the result of his scepticism about whether phenomena as inherently uncertain as economic activity could ever be adequately captured by mathematical models</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, many models were developed by Keynesian economists, with a famous example being the [[Phillips curve]] which predicted an inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation</span>
				<span class='text'>It implied that unemployment could be reduced by government stimulus with a calculable cost to inflation</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1968 Milton Friedman published a paper arguing that the fixed relationship implied by the Philips curve did not exist</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Friedman|first=Milton|date=March 1968|title=The Role of Monetary Policy|journal=[[American Economic Review]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;Friedman suggested that sustained Keynesian policies could lead to both unemployment and inflation rising at once – a phenomenon that soon became known as [[stagflation]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In the early 1970s stagflation appeared in both the US and Britain just as Friedman had predicted, with economic conditions deteriorating further after the [[1973 oil crisis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Aided by the prestige gained from his successful forecast, Friedman led increasingly successful criticisms against the Keynesian consensus, convincing not only academics and politicians but also much of the general public with his radio and television broadcasts</span>
				<span class='text'>The academic credibility of Keynesian economics was further undermined by additional criticism from other [[Monetarism|Monetarists]] trained in the [[Chicago school of economics]], by the [[Lucas critique]] and by criticisms from Hayek's [[Austrian School]]</span>
