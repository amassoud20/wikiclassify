				<span class='text'>The opposing political and religious views of Hugo's parents reflected the forces that would battle for supremacy in France throughout his life: Hugo's father was a high-ranking officer in Napoleon's army until he failed in Spain (one of the reasons why his name is not present on the ''{{lang|fr|[[Arc de Triomphe]]}}'')</span>

				<span class='text'>Although Napoleon III proclaimed a general amnesty in 1859, under which Hugo could have safely returned to France, the author stayed in exile, only returning when Napoleon III was forced from power as a result of the French defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870</span>
				<span class='text'>After the [[Siege of Paris (1870-1871)|Siege of Paris]] from 1870 to 71, Hugo lived again in Guernsey from 1872 to 1873, before finally returning to France for the remainder of his life</span>

				<span class='text'>Between 1829 and 1840, he published five more volumes of poetry (''{{lang|fr|[[Les Orientales]]}}'', 1829; ''{{lang|fr|[[Les Feuilles d'automne]]}}'', 1831; ''{{lang|fr|[[Les Chants du crépuscule]]}}'', 1835; ''{{lang|fr|[[Les Voix intérieures]]}}'', 1837; and ''{{lang|fr|[[Les Rayons et les ombres]]}}'', 1840), cementing his reputation as one of the greatest elegiac and lyric poets of his time</span>
				<span class='text'>ike many young writers of his generation, Hugo was profoundly influenced by {{lang|fr|[[François-René de Chateaubriand]]}}, the famous figure in the literary movement of [[Romanticism]] and France's pre-eminent literary figure during the early 19th century</span>

				<span class='text'>Like {{lang|fr|Chateaubriand}}, Hugo furthered the cause of Romanticism, became involved in politics (though mostly as a champion of [[Republicanism]]), and was forced into [[exile]] due to his political stances</span>

				<span class='text'>His first collection of poetry (''{{lang|fr|[[Odes et poésies diverses]]}}'') was published in 1822, when Hugo was only 20 years old, and earned him a royal pension from [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Though the poems were admired for their spontaneous fervour and fluency, the collection that followed four years later in 1826 (''{{lang|fr|[[Odes et Ballades]]}}'') revealed Hugo to be a great poet, a natural master of lyric and creative song</span>
				<span class='text'>ictor Hugo's first mature work of fiction appeared in 1829, and reflected the acute social conscience that would infuse his later work</span>
				<span class='text'>''{{lang|fr|Le Dernier jour d'un condamné}}'' (''[[The Last Day of a Condemned Man]]'') would have a profound influence on later writers such as {{lang|fr|[[Albert Camus]]}}, [[Charles Dickens]], and {{lang|ru-Latn|[[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]|nocat=y}}</span>
				<span class='text'>''{{lang|fr|[[Claude Gueux]]}}'', a documentary short story about a real-life murderer who had been executed in France, appeared in 1834, and was later considered by Hugo himself to be a precursor to his great work on social injustice, ''{{lang|fr|[[Les Misérables]]}}''</span>

				<span class='text'>Hugo was acutely aware of the quality of the novel{{clarify|date=December 2014}} and publication of the work went to the highest bidder</span>
				<span class='text'>The Belgian publishing house {{lang|fr|Lacroix}} and {{lang|nl|Verboeckhoven|nocat=y}} undertook a marketing campaign unusual for the time, issuing press releases about the work a full six months before the launch</span>
				<span class='text'>It also initially published only the first part of the novel (&quot;Fantine&quot;), which was launched simultaneously in major cities</span>
				<span class='text'>Instalments of the book sold out within hours, and had enormous impact on French society</span>
				<span class='text'>he critical establishment was generally hostile to the novel; {{lang|fr|[[Hippolyte Taine|Taine]]}} found it insincere, {{lang|fr|[[Barbey d'Aurevilly]]}} complained of its vulgarity, {{lang|fr|[[Gustave Flaubert]]}} found within it &quot;neither truth nor greatness&quot;, the [[Goncourt brothers|{{lang|fr|Goncourt|nocat=y}} brothers]] lambasted its artificiality, and {{lang|fr|[[Baudelaire]]}} – despite giving favourable reviews in newspapers – castigated it in private as &quot;tasteless and inept&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>The book was well received, perhaps due to the previous success of ''{{lang|fr|Les Misérables}}''</span>
				<span class='text'>Dedicated to the channel island of [[Guernsey]], where he spent 15 years of exile, Hugo tells of a man who attempts to win the approval of his beloved's father by rescuing his ship, intentionally marooned by its captain who hopes to escape with a treasure of money it is transporting, through an exhausting battle of human engineering against the force of the sea and a battle against an almost mythical beast of the sea, a giant squid</span>

				<span class='text'>Hugo returned to political and social issues in his next novel, ''{{lang|fr|L'Homme Qui Rit}}'' (''[[The Man Who Laughs]]''), which was published in 1869 and painted a critical picture of the aristocracy</span>

				<span class='text'>In particular, Hugo's plays, in which he rejected the rules of classical theatre in favour of romantic drama, attracted the interest of many composers who adapted them into operas</span>
				<span class='text'>More than one hundred operas are based on Hugo's works and among them are [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]]'s ''[[Lucrezia Borgia (opera)|Lucrezia Borgia]]'' (1833), [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''{{lang|it|[[Rigoletto]]|nocat=y}}'' (1851) and ''[[Ernani]]'' (1844), and {{lang|it|[[Amilcare Ponchielli|Ponchielli]]|nocat=y}}'s ''{{lang|it|[[La Gioconda (opera)|La Gioconda]]|nocat=y}}'' (1876)</span>

				<span class='text'>Additionally, Hugo's beautiful poems have attracted an exceptional amount of interest from musicians, and numerous melodies have been based on his poetry by composers such as {{lang|fr|Berlioz}}, {{lang|fr|[[Georges Bizet|Bizet]]}}, {{lang|fr|[[Gabriel Fauré|Fauré]]}}, {{lang|fr|[[César Franck|Franck]]}}, {{lang|fr|[[Édouard Lalo|Lalo]]}}, {{lang|fr|Liszt}}, {{lang|fr|[[Jules Massenet|Massenet]]}}, {{lang|fr|[[Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns]]}}, [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]] and {{lang|de|[[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]|nocat=y}}</span>

				<span class='text'>On 27 June, one of the largest parades in French history was held</span>

				<span class='text'>Originally pursued as a casual hobby, drawing became more important to Hugo shortly before his exile, when he made the decision to stop writing to devote himself to politics</span>
				<span class='text'>Drawing became his exclusive creative outlet during the period 1848–1851</span>
				<span class='text'>ugo worked only on paper, and on a small scale; usually in dark brown or black [[pen and ink|pen-and-ink]] wash, sometimes with touches of white, and rarely with colour</span>
				<span class='text'>The surviving drawings are surprisingly accomplished and &quot;modern&quot; in their style and execution, foreshadowing the experimental techniques of [[Surrealism]] and [[Abstract Expressionism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>e would not hesitate to use his children's stencils, ink blots, puddles and stains, lace impressions, &quot;{{lang|fr|pliage}}&quot; or folding (i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Rorschach blots), &quot;{{lang|fr|grattage}}&quot; or rubbing, often using the charcoal from match sticks or his fingers instead of pen or brush</span>
				<span class='text'>Sometimes he would even toss in coffee or soot to get the effects he wanted</span>
				<span class='text'>It is reported that Hugo often drew with his left hand or without looking at the page, or during [[Spiritualist]] [[séance]]s, to access his [[unconscious mind]], a concept only later popularised by [[Sigmund Freud]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ugo kept his artwork out of the public eye, fearing it would overshadow his literary work</span>
				<span class='text'>However, he enjoyed sharing his drawings with his family and friends, often in the form of ornately handmade calling cards, many of which were given as gifts to visitors when he was in political exile</span>
				<span class='text'>Some of his work was shown to, and appreciated by, contemporary artists such as [[Vincent van Gogh|van Gogh]] and {{lang|fr|[[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]]}}; the latter expressed the opinion that if Hugo had decided to become a painter instead of a writer, he would have outshone the artists of their century</span>
