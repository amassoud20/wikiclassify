				<span class='text'>Pepin of Herstal was eventually succeeded by his illegitimate son Charles later known as  Charles the Hammer</span>
				<span class='text'>fter 737 Charles governed the Franks without a king on the throne but declined to call himself king</span>
				<span class='text'>Charles was succeeded in 741 by his sons  and  the father of Charlemagne</span>
				<span class='text'>To curb separatism in the periphery of the realm in 743 the brothers placed on the throne  who was to be the last Merovingian king</span>
				<span class='text'>After Carloman resigned office in 746 to enter the church by perence as a monk Pepin brought the question of the kingship before  asking whether it was logical for a king to have no royal power</span>
				<span class='text'>The pope handed down his decision in 749</span>
				<span class='text'>He decreed that it was better for Pepin who had the powers of high office as Mayor to be called king so as not to confuse the hierarchy</span>
				<span class='text'>He theore ordered him to become true king</span>

				<span class='text'>In 753  fled from Italy to Francia appealing for assistance for the rights of St</span>
				<span class='text'>Peter to Pepin</span>
				<span class='text'>He was supported in this appeal by Carloman Charles brother</span>
				<span class='text'>In return the pope could provide only legitimacy which he did by again anointing and confirming Pepin this time adding his young sons Carolus and Carloman to the royal patrimony now heirs to the great realm that already covered most of western Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>In 754 Pepin accepted the Popes invitation to visit Italy on behalf of St</span>

				<span class='text'>The middle kingdom had broken up by 890</span>
				<span class='text'>The disposition of its territory remained a major source of divisiveness between France Germany and Italy down to the 20th century</span>
				<span class='text'>The ultimate solution was the creation of smaller nations in the buffer zones mainly  and  but also some very small states</span>
				<span class='text'>The concept and memory of a united Europe remains to the current time</span>
				<span class='text'> The  political and artistic evolutions originating from a centrally positioned Francia made a defining imprint on the whole of Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>ise to power The most likely date of Charlemagnes birth is reconstructed from several sources</span>
				<span class='text'>The date of 742 — calculated from s date of death of January 814 at age 72   predates the marriage of his parents in 744</span>
				<span class='text'>The year given in the  747 would be more likely except that it contradicts Einhard and a few other sources in making Charlemagne seventy years old at his death</span>
				<span class='text'>The month and day of April 2 is established by a calendar from </span>
				<span class='text'>name Baldwin In 747 that day fell on  a coincidence that likely would have been remarked upon by chroniclers but was not</span>
				<span class='text'>If Easter was being used as the beginning of the calendar year then 2 April 747 could have been by modern reckoning 2 April 748 not on Easter</span>
				<span class='text'>The date favored by the preponderance of evidence is 2 April 742 based on Charlemagnes being a septuagenarian at the time of his death</span>
				<span class='text'>name Baldwin  This date would appear to support the idea that Charlemagne was born  which is not however mentioned by Einhard</span>
				<span class='text'>Charlemagne’s exact birthplace is unknown although historians have suggested  in modern day Germany and   in present day Belgium as possible locations</span>
				<span class='text'> Aachen and Liège are close to the region from where both the Merovingian and Carolingian families originated</span>

				<span class='text'>he most powerful officers of the Frankish people the Mayor of the Palace Maior Domus and one or more kings rex reges were appointed by the election of the people that is no regular elections were held but they were held as required to elect officers ad quos summa imperii pertinebat to whom the highest matters of state pertained</span>
				<span class='text'>Evidently interim decisions could be made by the Pope which ultimately needed to be ratified using an assembly of the people which met once a year</span>
				<span class='text'>Before he was elected king in 750  was initially a mayor a high office he held as though hereditary velut hereditario fungebatur</span>
				<span class='text'>Einhard explains that the honor was usually given by the people to the distinguished but Pepin the Great and his brother Carloman the Wise received it as though hereditary as had their father </span>
				<span class='text'>There was however a certain ambiguity about quasi inheritance</span>
				<span class='text'>The office was treated as joint property one Mayorship held by two brothers jointly</span>
				<span class='text'>he Annales uses maiores domus a plural followed by a singular one house two chief officers</span>
				<span class='text'>  Each however had his own geographic jurisdiction</span>
				<span class='text'>When Carloman decided to resign becoming ultimately a Benedictine at   the question of the disposition of his quasi share was settled by the pope</span>
				<span class='text'>He converted the Mayorship into a Kingship and awarded the joint property to Pepin who now had the full right to pass it on by inheritance</span>
				<span class='text'>name Einhard3 This decision was not accepted by all members of the family</span>
				<span class='text'>Carloman had consented to the temporary tenancy of his own share which he intended to pass on to his own son Drogo when the inheritance should be settled at someones death</span>
				<span class='text'>By the Popes decision in which Pepin had a hand Drogo was to be disqualified as an heir in favor of his cousin Charles</span>
				<span class='text'>He took up arms in opposition to the decision and was joined by  a half brother of Pepin and Carloman who had been given a share by Charles Martel but was stripped of it and held under loose arrest by his half brothers after an attempt to seize their shares by military action</span>
				<span class='text'>By 753 all was over</span>
				<span class='text'>Grifo perished in combat in the Battle of  while Drogo was hunted down and taken into custody</span>
				<span class='text'> On the death of Pepin 24 September 768 the kingship passed jointly to his sons with divine assent divino nutu</span>
				<span class='text'>name Einhard3  According to the Life Pepin died in Paris</span>
				<span class='text'>The Franks in general assembly generali conventu gave them both the rank of king reges but partitioned the whole body of the kingdom equally totum regni corpus ex aequo partirentur</span>
				<span class='text'>The annals  tell a slightly different version with the king dying at  near Paris</span>
				<span class='text'>The two lords domni were elevated to kingship elevati sunt in regnum Charles on 9 October in  Carloman on an unspecified date in </span>
				<span class='text'>If born in 742 Charles was 26 years old but he had been campaigning at his fathers right hand for several years which may help to account for his military skill</span>
				<span class='text'> was 17</span>
				<span class='text'>he language in either case suggests that there were not two inheritances which would have created distinct kings ruling over distinct kingdoms but a single joint inheritance and a joint kingship tenanted by two equal kings Charles and his brother Carloman</span>
				<span class='text'>As before distinct jurisdictions were awarded</span>
				<span class='text'>Charles received Pepins original share as Mayor the outer parts of the kingdom bordering on the sea namely  western  and the northern parts of  while Carloman was awarded his uncles former share the inner parts southern Austrasia  eastern Aquitaine  Provence and  lands bordering </span>
				<span class='text'>The question of whether these jurisdictions were joint shares reverting to the other brother if one brother died or were inherited property passed on to the descendants of the brother who died was never definitely settled by the Frankish people</span>
				<span class='text'>It came up repeatedly over the succeeding decades until the grandsons of Charlemagne created distinct sovereign kingdoms</span>
				<span class='text'>n inheritance in the countries formerly under Roman law  or iustitia represented not only a transmission of the properties and privileges but also the encumbrances and obligations attached to the inheritance</span>
				<span class='text'>Pepin at his death had been in process of building an empire a difficult task</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Russell</span>
				<span class='text'>blockquoteIn those times to build a kingdom from an aggregation of small states was itself no great difficultyampnbsp</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>But to keep the state intact after it had been formed was a colossal taskampnbsp</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Each of the minor statesampnbsp</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>had its little sovereignampnbsp</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>gave himself chiefly toampnbsp</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>plotting pillaging and fighting</span>
				<span class='text'>blockquote Aquitania under Rome had been in southern  Romanized and speaking a </span>
				<span class='text'>Similarly  had been populated by peoples who spoke various languages including  but the area was now populated entirely by Romance language speakers</span>
				<span class='text'>Between Aquitania and Hispania were the Euskaldunak Latinized to  or </span>
				<span class='text'> living in Basque country Vasconia which extended according to the distributions of place names attributable to the Basques most densely in the western  but also as far south as the upper  in Spain and as far north as the  in France</span>
				<span class='text'>  The French name  derives from Vasconia</span>
				<span class='text'>The Romans were never able to entirely subject Vasconia</span>
				<span class='text'>The parts they did in which they placed the regions first cities were sources of legions in the Roman army valued for their fighting abilities</span>
				<span class='text'>The border with Aquitania was </span>
				<span class='text'>t about 660 the  united with the  to form a single kingdom under  governing from Toulouse</span>
				<span class='text'>This was a joint kingship with a 28 year old Basque king </span>
				<span class='text'> Lupus is the Latin translation of Basque Otsoa wolf</span>
				<span class='text'> The kingdom was sovereign and independent</span>
				<span class='text'>On the one hand Vasconia gave up predation to become a player on the field of European politics</span>
				<span class='text'>On the other whatever arrangements Felix had made with the weak Merovingians were null and void</span>
				<span class='text'>At Felixs death in 670 the joint property of the kingship reverted entirely to Lupus</span>
				<span class='text'>As the Basques had no law of joint inheritance but practiced  Lupus in effect founded a hereditary dynasty of Basque kings of an expanded Aquitania</span>
				<span class='text'>  The Latin chronicles on the end of Visigothic  leave much to be desired such as identification of characters filling in the gaps and reconciliation of numerous contradictions</span>
				<span class='text'>The sequence of eventsampnbsp</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>has not been assisted by the tendency of the historians to take all the informationampnbsp</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>from all the available sources and combine it to produce a single synthetic accountampnbsp</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>As a rule of thumb reliability and also brevity of narrative are usually in direct proportion to chronological proximity</span>
				<span class='text'> The Muslim sources however present a more coherent view such as in the Tarikh iftitah al Andalus History of the Conquest of al Andalus by  a name meaning the son of the Gothic woman erring to the granddaughter of the last king of all Visigothic Spain who married a Moor</span>
				<span class='text'>Ibn al Qūṭiyya who had another much longer name must have been relying to some degree on family oral tradition</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to Ibn al Qūṭiyya</span>
				<span class='text'> the last Visigothic king of a united Hispania died before his three sons Almund Romulo and Ardabast reached majority</span>
				<span class='text'>Their mother was regent at  but  army chief of staff staged a rebellion capturing </span>
				<span class='text'>Of all the possible outcomes he chose to impose a joint rule over distinct jurisdictions on the true heirs</span>
				<span class='text'>Evidence of a division of some sort can be found in the distribution of coins imprinted with the name of each king and in the king lists</span>
				<span class='text'>  Wittiza is succeeded by Roderic who reigned for seven and a half years followed by a certain Achila Aquila who reigned three and a half years</span>
				<span class='text'>If the reigns of both terminated with the incursion of the Saracens then Roderic appears to have reigned a few years before the majority of Achila</span>
				<span class='text'>The latters kingdom is securely placed to the northeast while Roderic seems to have taken the rest notably Portugal</span>

				<span class='text'>In one of the first of the lightning marches for which the Carolingian kings became famous Charles and his army appeared in the path of the Saracens between Tours and  and in the  decisively defeated and killed al Ghafiqi</span>
				<span class='text'>The Moors would come back twice more only to suffer defeat at Charles hands twice more   at the River Berre near Narbonne in 737  and a second time in the Dauphine in 740</span>
				<span class='text'> Odos price for salvation from the Saracens was incorporation into Frankish kingdom a decision that was repugnant to him and also to his heirs</span>
				<span class='text'>After the death of his son  allied himself with free </span>
				<span class='text'>However Odo had ambiguously left the kingdom jointly to his two sons Hunald and Hatto</span>
				<span class='text'>The latter loyal to Francia now went to war with his brother over full possession</span>
				<span class='text'>Victorious Hunald blinded and imprisoned his brother only to be so stricken by conscience that he resigned and entered the church as a monk to do penance according to Carolingian sources</span>
				<span class='text'>he story originally told in the  is retold in   His son  took an early inheritance becoming duke of Aquitania and ratified the alliance with Lombardy</span>
				<span class='text'>Waifer decided to honor it repeating his fathers decision which he justified by arguing that any agreements with Charles Martel became invalid on Martels death</span>
				<span class='text'>Since Aquitania was now Pepins inheritance because of the earlier assistance given by Charles Martel according to some the latter and his son the young Charles hunted down Waifer who could only conduct a guerrilla war and executed him</span>
				<span class='text'> Among the contingents of the Frankish army were ns under  an  the hereditary Bavarian ducal family</span>
				<span class='text'> had installed himself as Duke of Bavaria but Pepin replaced him with a member of the ducal family yet a child Tassilo whose protector he had become after the death of his father</span>
				<span class='text'>The loyalty of the Agilolfings was perpetually in question but Pepin exacted numerous oaths of loyalty from Tassilo</span>
				<span class='text'>However the latter had married  a daughter of  king of </span>
				<span class='text'>At a critical point in the campaign Tassilo with all his Bavarians left the field</span>
				<span class='text'>Out of reach of Pepin he repudiated all loyalty to Francia</span>
				<span class='text'>  Pepin had no chance to respond as he grew ill and within a few weeks after the execution of Waifer died himself</span>
				<span class='text'>he first event of the brothers reign was the uprising of the Aquitainians and s in 769 in that territory split between the two kings</span>
				<span class='text'>One year before Pepin had finally defeated   after waging a destructive ten year war against Aquitaine</span>
				<span class='text'>Now one Hunald seemingly other than  the duke led the Aquitainians as far north as </span>
				<span class='text'>Charles met Carloman but Carloman used to participate and returned to Burgundy</span>
				<span class='text'>Charles went to war leading an army to  where he set up a fort at Fronsac</span>
				<span class='text'>Hunald was forced to flee to the court of Duke </span>
				<span class='text'>Lupus fearing Charles turned Hunald over in exchange for peace and he was put in a monastery</span>
				<span class='text'>Gascon lords also surrendered and Aquitaine and  were finally fully subdued by the Franks</span>
				<span class='text'>he brothers maintained lukewarm relations with the assistance of their mother Bertrada but in 770 Charles signed a treaty with Duke  and married a Lombard Princess commonly known today as  the daughter of King  to surround Carloman with his own allies</span>
				<span class='text'>Though  first opposed the marriage with the Lombard princess he would soon have little to fear from a Frankish Lombard alliance</span>
				<span class='text'>ess than a year after his marriage Charlemagne repudiated Desiderata and quickly married a 13 year old Swabian named </span>
				<span class='text'>The repudiated Desiderata returned to her fathers court at </span>
				<span class='text'>Her fathers wrath was now aroused and he would have gladly allied with Carloman to defeat Charles</span>

				<span class='text'>Historians have debated for centuries whether Charlemagne was aware of the Popes intent to crown him Emperor prior to the coronation Charlemagne declared that he would not have entered Saint Peters had he known but that debate has often obscured the arguably more significant question of why the Pope granted the title and why Charlemagne chose to accept it once he did</span>
				<span class='text'>e said that he would have used to enter the church that day although it was a major festival had he been aware of the popes plans</span>

				<span class='text'>147  For one thing such romance would not have appealed either to Franks or Roman Catholics at the turn of the ninth century both of whom viewed the  heritage of the Roman Empire with distrust</span>
				<span class='text'>The Franks took pride in having fought against and thrown from their shoulders the heavy yoke of the Romans and from the knowledge gained in baptism clothed in gold and precious stones the bodies of the holy martyrs whom the Romans had killed by fire by the sword and by wild animals as PippinampnbspIII described it in a law of 763 or 764</span>
				<span class='text'>name Collins151Collins 151 Furthermore the new title—carrying with it the risk that the new emperor would make drastic changes to the traditional styles and procedures of government or concentrate his attentions on Italy or on Mediterranean concerns more generally—risked alienating the Frankish leadership</span>
				<span class='text'>ollins Charlemagne p</span>
				<span class='text'>149 For both the Pope and Charlemagne the Roman Empire remained a significant power in European politics at this time and continued to hold a substantial portion of Italy with borders not very far south of the city of Rome itself—this is the empire that historiography has labelled the Byzantine Empire for its capital was Constantinople ancient Byzantium and its people and rulers were  it was a thoroughly Hellenic state</span>

				<span class='text'>234n  disputes this saying that the coronation was not in any sense explained by the fact that at this moment a woman was reigning in Constantinople</span>
				<span class='text'>Nonetheless the Pope took the extraordinary step of creating one</span>
				<span class='text'>The papacy had since 727 been in conflict with Irenes predecessors in Constantinople over a number of issues chiefly the continued Byzantine adherence to the doctrine of iconoclasm the destruction of Christian images while from 750 the secular power of the Byzantine Empire in central Italy had been nullified</span>

				<span class='text'>ith Charlemagnes coronation theore the Roman Empire remained so far as either of them Charlemagne and Leo were concerned one and indivisible with Charles as its Emperor though there can have been little doubt that the coronation with all that it implied would be furiously contested in Constantinople</span>
				<span class='text'>orwich Byzantium The Apogee pg</span>
				<span class='text'>3 How realistic either Charlemagne or the Pope felt it to be that the people of Constantinople would ever accept the King of the Franks as their Emperor we cannot know Alcuin speaks hopefully in his letters of an Imperium Christianum Christian Empire wherein just as the inhabitants of the Roman Empire had been united by a common Roman citizenship presumably this new empire would be united by a common Christian faith name Collins151  certainly this is the view of Pirenne when he says Charles was the Emperor of the ecclesia as the Pope conceived it of the Roman Church regarded as the universal Church</span>
				<span class='text'>irenne 233  The Imperium Christianum was further supported at a number of s all across the Europe by Paulinus of Aquileia</span>
				<span class='text'>name Butler1995 What is known from the Byzantine chronicler Collins 153  is that Charlemagnes reaction to his coronation was to take the initial steps toward securing the Constantinopolitan throne by sending envoys of marriage to Irene and that Irene reacted somewhat favorably to them</span>
				<span class='text'>t is important to distinguish between the universalist and localist conceptions of the empire which have been the source of considerable controversy among historians</span>
				<span class='text'>According to the former the empire was a universal monarchy a commonwealth of the whole world whose sublime unity transcended every minor distinction and the emperor was entitled to the obedience of Christendom</span>
				<span class='text'>According to the latter the emperor had no ambition for universal dominion his policy was limited in the same way as that of every other ruler and when he made more far reaching claims his object was normally to ward off the attacks either of the pope or of the Byzantine emperor</span>
				<span class='text'>According to this view also the origin of the empire is to be explained by specific local circumstances rather than by far flung theories</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Werner Ohnsorge for a long time it had been the custom of Byzantium to designate the German princes as spiritual sons of the Byzantines</span>
				<span class='text'>What might have been acceptable in the fifth century to the pride of the Franks in the eighth century was provoking and insulting</span>
				<span class='text'>Charles came to the realization that the great Roman emperor who claimed to be the head of the world hierarchy of states in reality was no greater than Charles himself a king as other kings since beginning in 629 he had entitled himself Basileus translated literally as king</span>
