				<span class='text'>In return the pope could provide only legitimacy, which he did by again anointing and confirming Pepin, this time adding his young sons Carolus and Carloman to the royal patrimony, now heirs to the great realm that already covered most of western Europe</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oman|1914|pp=409–410}} portrays the [[Treaty of Verdun]], 843, between the warring grandsons of Charlemagne, as the foundation event of an independent France under its first king, [[Charles the Bald]], an independent Germany, under its first king, [[Louis the German]], and an independent intermediate state stretching from the [[low countries]] along the borderlands to south of Rome under [[Lothair I]], who retained the title of emperor and the capitals [[Aachen]] and [[Rome]] without the jurisdiction</span>
				<span class='text'>The middle kingdom had broken up by 890</span>
				<span class='text'>The disposition of its territory remained a major source of divisiveness between France, Germany, and Italy down to the 20th century</span>

				<span class='text'>quot; Evidently interim decisions could be made by the Pope, which ultimately needed to be ratified using an assembly of the people, which met once a year</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Einhard|1999|loc=1</span>
				<span class='text'>The Merovingian Family}}&lt;/ref&gt;Before he was elected king in 750, [[Pepin the Short]] was initially a mayor, a high office he held &quot;as though hereditary&quot; (velut hereditario fungebatur)</span>
				<span class='text'>Einhard explains that &quot;the honor&quot; was usually &quot;given by the people&quot; to the distinguished, but Pepin the Great and his brother Carloman the Wise received it as though hereditary, as had their father, [[Charles Martel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>There was, however, a certain ambiguity about quasi-inheritance</span>
				<span class='text'>The office was treated as joint property: one Mayorship held by two brothers jointly</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;The ''Annales'' uses maiores domus, a plural followed by a singular: one house, two chief officers</span>
				<span class='text'>{{harvnb|Einhard, putative|741–829|loc=Year 742}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each, however, had his own geographic jurisdiction</span>
				<span class='text'>When Carloman decided to resign, becoming ultimately a Benedictine at [[Monte Cassino]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Einhard, putative|741–829|loc=Years 745, 746}}&lt;/ref&gt; the question of the disposition of his quasi-share was settled by the pope</span>
				<span class='text'>He converted the Mayorship into a Kingship and awarded the joint property to Pepin, who now had the full right to pass it on by inheritance</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Einhard3&gt;{{harvnb|Einhard|1999|loc=3</span>
				<span class='text'>Charlemagne's Accession}}&lt;/ref&gt;This decision was not accepted by all members of the family</span>
				<span class='text'>Carloman had consented to the temporary tenancy of his own share, which he intended to pass on to his own son, Drogo, when the inheritance should be settled at someone's death</span>
				<span class='text'>By the Pope's decision, in which Pepin had a hand, Drogo was to be disqualified as an heir in favor of his cousin Charles</span>
				<span class='text'>He took up arms in opposition to the decision and was joined by [[Grifo]], a half-brother of Pepin and Carloman, who had been given a share by Charles Martel, but was stripped of it and held under loose arrest by his half-brothers after an attempt to seize their shares by military action</span>
				<span class='text'>By 753 all was over</span>
				<span class='text'>Grifo perished in combat in the Battle of [[Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne]] while Drogo was hunted down and taken into custody</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collins|1998|pp=32–33}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;On the death of Pepin, 24 September 768, the kingship passed jointly to his sons, &quot;with divine assent&quot; (divino nutu)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Einhard3/&gt; According to the ''Life'', Pepin died in Paris</span>
				<span class='text'>The Franks &quot;in general assembly&quot; (generali conventu) gave them both the rank of king (reges) but &quot;partitioned the whole body of the kingdom equally&quot; (totum regni corpus ex aequo partirentur)</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''annals''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Einhard, putative|741–829|loc=Year 768}}&lt;/ref&gt; tell a slightly different version, with the king dying at [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|St-Denis]], near Paris</span>
				<span class='text'>The two &quot;lords&quot; (domni) were &quot;elevated to kingship&quot; (elevati sunt in regnum), Charles on 9 October in [[Noyon]], Carloman on an unspecified date in [[Soissons]]</span>
				<span class='text'>If born in 742, Charles was 26 years old, but he had been campaigning at his father's right hand for several years, which may help to account for his military skill</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Carloman I|Carloman]] was 17</span>
				<span class='text'>he language in either case suggests that there were not two inheritances, which would have created distinct kings ruling over distinct kingdoms, but a single joint inheritance and a joint kingship tenanted by two equal kings, Charles and his brother Carloman</span>
				<span class='text'>As before, distinct jurisdictions were awarded</span>
				<span class='text'>Charles received Pepin's original share as Mayor: the outer parts of the kingdom bordering on the sea, namely [[Neustria]], western [[Aquitaine]], and the northern parts of [[Austrasia]]; while Carloman was awarded his uncle's former share, the inner parts: southern Austrasia, [[Septimania]], eastern Aquitaine, [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], Provence, and [[Swabia]], lands bordering [[Italy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The question of whether these jurisdictions were joint shares reverting to the other brother if one brother died or were inherited property passed on to the descendants of the brother who died was never definitely settled by the Frankish people</span>
				<span class='text'>It came up repeatedly over the succeeding decades until the grandsons of Charlemagne created distinct sovereign kingdoms</span>
				<span class='text'>==Aquitanian rebellion===An inheritance in the countries formerly under Roman law ([[ius]] or iustitia) represented not only a transmission of the properties and privileges but also the encumbrances and obligations attached to the inheritance</span>
				<span class='text'>Pepin at his death had been in process of building an empire, a difficult task</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Russell:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Russell|1930|page=87}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;In those times, to build a kingdom from an aggregation of small states was itself no great difficulty&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>

				<span class='text'></span>

				<span class='text'>Similarly [[Hispania]] had been populated by peoples who spoke various languages, including [[Celtic language|Celtic]], but the area was now populated entirely by Romance language speakers</span>
				<span class='text'>Between Aquitania and Hispania were the Euskaldunak, Latinized to [[Vascones]], or [[Basques]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collins|1987|p=32}}</span>

				<span class='text'>The Romans were never able to entirely subject Vasconia</span>

				<span class='text'>==Perforce Union===The brothers maintained lukewarm relations with the assistance of their mother Bertrada, but in 770 Charles signed a treaty with Duke [[Tassilo III of Bavaria]] and married a Lombard Princess (commonly known today as [[Desiderata, wife of Charlemagne|Desiderata]]), the daughter of King [[Desiderius]], to surround Carloman with his own allies</span>
				<span class='text'>Though [[Pope Stephen III]] first opposed the marriage with the Lombard princess, he would soon have little to fear from a Frankish-Lombard alliance</span>

				<span class='text'>Her father's wrath was now aroused, and he would have gladly allied with Carloman to defeat Charles</span>

				<span class='text'>In 781, he made his two youngest sons kings, having them crowned by the Pope</span>
				<span class='text'>The elder of these two, [[Pippin of Italy|Carloman]], was made [[king of Italy]], taking the Iron Crown that his father had first worn in 774, and in the same ceremony was renamed &quot;Pepin</span>

				<span class='text'>Nor did he tolerate insubordination in his sons: in 792, he banished his eldest, though possibly illegitimate, son, [[Pippin the Hunchback]], to the monastery of Prüm, because the young man had joined a rebellion against him</span>

				<span class='text'>He subjected them to Frankish authority and devastated the valley of the Elbe, forcing a tribute on them</span>
				<span class='text'>Pippin had to hold the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avar]] and Beneventan borders but also fought the [[Slavs]] to his north</span>
				<span class='text'>He was uniquely poised to fight the [[Byzantine Empire]] when finally that conflict arose after Charlemagne's imperial coronation and a [[Venetia (region)|Venetian]] rebellion</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally, Louis was in charge of the [[Spanish March]] and also went to southern Italy to fight the duke of Benevento on at least one occasion</span>

				<span class='text'>He also, apparently, refused to believe stories of their wild behavior</span>

				<span class='text'>After the defeat and death of [[Waifer of Aquitaine]] in 768, while Aquitaine submitted again to the Carolingian dynasty, a new rebellion broke out in 769 led by Hunald II, maybe son of Waifer</span>
				<span class='text'>He took refuge with the ally duke [[Lupus II of Gascony]], but probably out of fear of Charlemagne's reprisal, handed him over to the new King of the Franks besides pledging loyalty to him, which seemed to confirm the peace in [[Duchy of Vasconia|the Basque area]] south of the Garonne</span>
				<span class='text'>owever, wary of new Basque uprisings, Charlemagne seems to have tried to diminish duke Lupus's power by appointing a certain [[Seguin I of Gascony|Seguin]] as count of Bordeaux (778) and other counts of Frankish background in bordering areas ([[History of Toulouse#768–877: Carolingian Franks and the Kingdom of Aquitaine|Toulouse]], [[County of Fézensac]]), a decision that seriously undermined the authority of the duke of Gascony (Vasconia)</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[History of the Basque people#Early Middle Ages|Basque]] duke in turn seems to have contributed decisively or schemed the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]] (referred to as &quot;Basque treachery&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>The defeat of Charlemagne's army in Roncevaux (778) confirmed him in his determination to rule directly by establishing the Kingdom of Aquitaine (son [[Louis the Pious]] proclaimed first king) based on a power base of Frankish officials, distributing lands among colonisers and allocating lands to the Church, which he took as ally</span>
				<span class='text'>A Christianization program was put on place across the high [[Pyrenees]] (778)</span>

				<span class='text'>As of 794, we hear for the first time of a Frankish vassal, the Basque lord Belasko (''al-Galashki'', 'the Gaul') in the lands of [[Álava]], but Pamplona remained in Cordovan and local hands up to 806</span>
				<span class='text'>Belasko and the counties in the Marca Hispánica provided the necessary springboard to attack the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusians]] (expedition led by [[William of Gellone|William Count of Toulouse]] and Louis the Pious to capture Barcelona in 801), in a way that Charlemagne had succeeded in expanding the Carolingian rule all around the Pyrenees by 812, although events in the Duchy of Vasconia (rebellion in Pamplona, [[Aznar Galíndez I|count overthrown in Aragon]], duke Seguin of Bordeaux deposed, uprising of the Basque lords, etc</span>

				<span class='text'>The armies met at Saragossa and Charlemagne received the homage of the Muslim rulers, Sulayman al-Arabi and Kasmin ibn Yusuf, but the city did not fall for him</span>
				<span class='text'>Indeed, Charlemagne was facing the toughest battle of his career where the Muslims had the upper hand and forced him to retreat</span>
				<span class='text'>He decided to go home, since he could not trust the [[Basques]], whom he had subdued by conquering [[Pamplona]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He turned to leave Iberia, but as he was passing through the Pass of [[Roncesvalles]] one of the most famous events of his long reign occurred</span>

				<span class='text'>The laws were [[wikt:draconian|draconian]] on religious issues; for example, the ''[[Capitulatio de partibus Saxoniae]]'' prescribed death to Saxon pagans who refused to convert to Christianity</span>

				<span class='text'>That year, in autumn, Widukind returned and led a new revolt</span>
				<span class='text'>In response, at [[Verden, Germany|Verden]] in Lower Saxony, Charlemagne is recorded as having ordered the execution of 4,500 Saxon prisoners, known as the [[Massacre of Verden]] (&quot;Verdener Blutgericht&quot;)</span>

				<span class='text'>The remaining power confronting the Franks in the east were the [[Avar people (Caucasus)|Avars]], however Charlemagne went on acquiring other Slav areas, including [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]], [[Austria]] and [[Croatia]]</span>

				<span class='text'>The campaigns would have continued if the Saxons had not revolted again in 792, breaking seven years of peace</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|200px|The throne of Charlemagne and the subsequent German Kings in [[Aachen Cathedral]]</span>
				<span class='text'>]Historians have debated for centuries whether Charlemagne was aware of the Pope's intent to crown him Emperor prior to the coronation (Charlemagne declared that he would not have entered Saint Peter's had he known), but that debate has often obscured the arguably more significant question of ''why'' the Pope granted the title and why Charlemagne chose to accept it once he did</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;&quot;he said that he would have refused to enter the church that day, although it was a major festival, had he been aware of the pope's plans&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Einhard, The life of Charlemagne,&amp;nbsp;28&lt;/ref&gt;[[Roger Collins]] points out &quot;[t]hat the motivation behind the acceptance of the imperial title was a romantic and antiquarian interest in reviving the Roman empire is highly unlikely</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Collins, ''Charlemagne'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>147&lt;/ref&gt; For one thing, such romance would not have appealed either to Franks or Roman Catholics at the turn of the ninth century, both of whom viewed the [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] heritage of the Roman Empire with distrust</span>
				<span class='text'>The Franks took pride in having &quot;fought against and thrown from their shoulders the heavy yoke of the Romans&quot; and &quot;from the knowledge gained in baptism, clothed in gold and precious stones the bodies of the holy martyrs whom the Romans had killed by fire, by the sword and by wild animals&quot;, as Pippin&amp;nbsp;III described it in a law of 763 or 764</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Collins151&quot;&gt;Collins 151&lt;/ref&gt;Furthermore, the new title—carrying with it the risk that the new emperor would &quot;make drastic changes to the traditional styles and procedures of government&quot; or &quot;concentrate his attentions on Italy or on Mediterranean concerns more generally&quot;—risked alienating the Frankish leadership</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Collins, ''Charlemagne'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>149&lt;/ref&gt;For both the Pope and Charlemagne, the Roman Empire remained a significant power in European politics at this time, and continued to hold a substantial portion of Italy, with borders not very far south of the city of Rome itself—this is the empire that historiography has labelled the Byzantine Empire, for its capital was Constantinople (ancient Byzantium) and its people and rulers were [[Byzantine Empire|Greek]]; it was a thoroughly Hellenic state</span>
				<span class='text'>Indeed, Charlemagne was usurping the prerogatives of the Roman Emperor in Constantinople simply by sitting in judgement over the Pope in the first place:{{quote|By whom, however, could he [the Pope] be tried? Who, in other words, was qualified to pass judgement on the Vicar of Christ? In normal circumstances the only conceivable answer to that question would have been the Emperor at Constantinople; but the imperial throne was at this moment occupied by Irene</span>
				<span class='text'>That the Empress was notorious for having blinded and murdered her own son was, in the minds of both Leo and Charles, almost immaterial: it was enough that she was a woman</span>
				<span class='text'>The female sex was known to be incapable of governing, and by the old Salic tradition was debarred from doing so</span>
				<span class='text'>As far as Western Europe was concerned, the Throne of the Emperors was vacant: Irene's claim to it was merely an additional proof, if any were needed, of the degradation into which the so-called Roman Empire had fallen</span>
				<span class='text'>[[John Julius Norwich]]|Byzantium: The Early Centuries, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>378}}For the Pope, then, there was &quot;no living Emperor at the that time&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Norwich 379,&lt;/ref&gt; though [[Henri Pirenne]]&lt;ref&gt;''Mohammed and Charlemagne'', pg</span>
				<span class='text'>234n&lt;/ref&gt; disputes this saying that the coronation &quot;was not in any sense explained by the fact that at this moment a woman was reigning in Constantinople</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Nonetheless, the Pope took the extraordinary step of creating one</span>
				<span class='text'>The papacy had since 727 been in conflict with Irene's predecessors in Constantinople over a number of issues, chiefly the continued Byzantine adherence to the doctrine of iconoclasm, the destruction of Christian images; while from 750, the secular power of the Byzantine Empire in central Italy had been nullified</span>

				<span class='text'>]It is important to distinguish between the universalist and localist conceptions of the empire, which have been the source of considerable controversy among historians</span>
				<span class='text'>According to the former, the empire was a universal monarchy, a &quot;commonwealth of the whole world, whose sublime unity transcended every minor distinction&quot;; and the emperor &quot;was entitled to the obedience of Christendom</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; According to the latter, the emperor had no ambition for universal dominion; his policy was limited in the same way as that of every other ruler, and when he made more far-reaching claims his object was normally to ward off the attacks either of the pope or of the Byzantine emperor</span>
				<span class='text'>According to this view, also, the origin of the empire is to be explained by specific local circumstances rather than by far-flung theories</span>

				<span class='text'>What might have been acceptable in the fifth century, to the pride of the Franks in the eighth century was provoking and insulting</span>
				<span class='text'>Charles came to the realization that the great Roman emperor, who claimed to be the head of the world hierarchy of states, in reality was no greater than Charles himself, a king as other kings, since beginning in 629 he had entitled himself &quot;Basileus&quot; (translated literally as &quot;king&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>Ohnsorge finds it significant that the chief wax seal of Charles, which bore only the inscription: &quot;Christe, protege Carolum regem Francorum [Christ, protect Charles, king of the Franks], was used from 772 to 813, even during the imperial period and was not replaced by a special imperial seal; indicating that Charles felt himself to be king of the Franks and wished only for the greatness of his Frankish people</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally, Ohnsorge points out that in the spring of 813 at Aachen Charles crowned his youngest, only surviving son, Louis, as emperor without recourse to Rome and only with the acclamation of his Franks, also the form in which this acclamation was offered was no longer Roman, but Frankish-Christian; thus demonstrating both independence from Rome, and a Frankish understanding of empire different from Rome's</span>

				<span class='text'>Thus, Charlemagne's assumption of the imperial title was not a usurpation in the eyes of the Franks or Italians</span>
				<span class='text'>It was, however, seen as such in Byzantium, where it was protested by Irene and her successor [[Nicephorus&amp;nbsp;I]] — neither of whom had any great effect in enforcing their protests</span>
				<span class='text'>he Byzantines, however, still held several territories in Italy: Venice (what was left of the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]]), [[Reggio Calabria|Reggio]] (in [[Calabria]]), [[Brindisi]] (in [[Apulia]]), and [[Naples]] (the ''[[Ducatus Neapolitanus]]'')</span>

				<span class='text'>Nicephorus ravaged the coasts with a fleet, initiating the only instance of war between the Byzantines and the Franks</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Dutton, Paul Edward, ''Charlemagne's Mustache''&lt;/ref&gt;His great scholarly failure, as Einhard relates, was his inability to write: when in his old age he began attempts to learn—practicing the formation of letters in his bed during his free time on books and wax tablets he hid under his pillow—&quot;his effort came too late in life and achieved little success&quot;, and his ability to read – which Einhard is silent about, and which no contemporary source supports—has also been called into question</span>

				<span class='text'>[[Carolingian minuscule]] was created partly under the patronage of Charlemagne</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Alcuin]] of York, who ran the palace school and [[scriptorium]] at Aachen, was probably a chief influence in this</span>

				<span class='text'>His administration was an attempt to organize the kingdom, church, and nobility around him</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the effort was heavily dependent upon the efficiency, loyalty, and support of his subjects</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}====Divisio regnorum====In 806, Charlemagne first made provision for the traditional division of the empire on his death</span>
				<span class='text'>For Charles the Younger he designated Austrasia and Neustria, Saxony, Burgundy, and [[Thuringia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>To Pippin he gave Italy, Bavaria, and [[Swabia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis received Aquitaine, the Spanish March, and [[Provence]]</span>
				<span class='text'>There was no mention of the imperial title however, which has led to the suggestion that, at that particular time, Charlemagne regarded the title as an honorary achievement which held no hereditary significance</span>
				<span class='text'>his division might have worked, but it was never to be tested</span>
				<span class='text'>Pippin died in 810 and Charles in 811</span>
				<span class='text'>Charlemagne then reconsidered the matter, and in 813, crowned his youngest son, Louis, co-emperor and co-King of the Franks, granting him a half-share of the empire and the rest upon Charlemagne's own death</span>

				<span class='text'>He had a round head, large and lively eyes, a slightly larger nose than usual, white but still attractive hair, a bright and cheerful expression, a short and fat neck, and he enjoyed good health, except for the fevers that affected him in the last few years of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>Toward the end, he dragged one leg</span>
				<span class='text'>Even then, he stubbornly did what he wanted and refused to listen to doctors, indeed he detested them, because they wanted to persuade him to stop eating roast meat, as was his wont, and to be content with boiled meat</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;He wore a blue cloak and always carried a sword with him</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Charlemagne's biographer [[Einhard]] (Vita Karoli Magni, ch</span>
				<span class='text'>20) calls her a &quot;concubine&quot; and [[Paulus Diaconus]] speaks of Pippin's birth &quot;before legal marriage&quot;, whereas a letter by [[Pope Stephen III]] refers to Charlemagne and his brother Carloman as being already married (to Himiltrude and [[Gerberga, wife of Carloman I|Gerberga]]), and advises them not to dismiss their wives</span>
				<span class='text'>Historians have interpreted the information in different ways</span>
				<span class='text'>Some, such as [[Pierre Riché]] (''The Carolingians'', p</span>

				<span class='text'>, consider Himiltrude a wife in the full sense</span>
				<span class='text'>Still others subscribe to the idea that the relationship between the two was &quot;something more than concubinage, less than marriage&quot; and describe it as a [[Friedelehe]], a form of marriage unrecognized by the Church and easily dissolvable</span>
				<span class='text'>Russell Chamberlin (''The Emperor Charlemagne'', p</span>

				<span class='text'>, for instance, compared it with the English system of common-law marriage</span>
