				<span class='text'>Sir Alexander Fleming  name frs  6 August 188111 March 1955 was a Scottish   and </span>

				<span class='text'>arly life and educationFleming was born on 6 August  1881 at Lochfield farm near  in  Scotland</span>
				<span class='text'>He was the third of the four children of farmer Hugh Fleming 1816–1888 from his second marriage to Grace Stirling Morton 1848–1928 the daughter of a neighbouring farmer</span>
				<span class='text'>Hugh Fleming had four surviving children from his first marriage</span>
				<span class='text'>He was 59 at the time of his second marriage and died when Alexander known as Alex was seven</span>
				<span class='text'>leming went to  and Darvel School and earned a two year scholarship to  before moving to London where he attended the </span>
				<span class='text'>name Penicillin man  After working in a shipping office for four years the twenty year old Fleming inherited some money from an uncle John Fleming</span>
				<span class='text'>His elder brother Tom was already a physician and suggested to his younger sibling that he should follow the same career and so in 1903 the younger Alexander enrolled at  in  he qualified with an  degree from the school with distinction in 1906</span>
				<span class='text'>leming had been a private in the  of the  since 1900 name lesprixnobel   and had been a member of the rifle club at the medical school</span>
				<span class='text'>The captain of the club wishing to retain Fleming in the team suggested that he join the research department at St Marys where he became assistant bacteriologist to Sir  a pioneer in  therapy and immunology</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1908 he gained a  degree with Gold Medal in  and became a lecturer at St Marys until 1914</span>
				<span class='text'>leming served throughout  as a captain in the  and was </span>
				<span class='text'>He and many of his colleagues worked in battlefield hospitals at the  in France</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1918 he returned to  where he was elected Professor of Bacteriology of the  in 1928</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1951 he was elected the Rector of the  for a term of 3 years</span>
				<span class='text'>esearchFollowing World War I Fleming actively searched for anti bacterial agents having witnessed the death of many soldiers from  resulting from infected </span>
				<span class='text'> killed the patients immunological defences more effectively than they killed the invading bacteria</span>
				<span class='text'>In an article he submitted for the medical journal  during World War I Fleming described an ingenious experiment which he was able to conduct as a result of his own glass blowing skills in which he explained why antiseptics were killing more soldiers than infection itself during World War I</span>
				<span class='text'>Antiseptics worked well on the surface but deep wounds tended to shelter anaerobic bacteria from the antiseptic agent and antiseptics seemed to remove beneficial agents produced that protected the patients in these cases at least as well as they removed bacteria and did nothing to remove the bacteria that were out of reach</span>
				<span class='text'>Sir  strongly supported Flemings findings but despite this most army physicians over the course of the war continued to use antiseptics even in cases where this worsened the condition of the patients</span>

				<span class='text'> Testing the nasal secretions from a patient with a heavy cold he found that nasal mucus had an inhibitory effect on bacterial growth</span>
				<span class='text'>  This was the first recorded discovery of  an enzyme present in many secretions including tears saliva human milk as well as mucus</span>

				<span class='text'>He was already well known from his earlier work and had developed a reputation as a brilliant researcher but his laboratory was often untidy</span>
				<span class='text'>On 3 September 1928 Fleming returned to his laboratory having spent August on holiday with his family</span>
				<span class='text'>Before leaving he had stacked all his cultures of staphylococci on a bench in a corner of his laboratory</span>
				<span class='text'>On returning Fleming noticed that one culture was contaminated with a fungus and that the colonies of staphylococci immediately surrounding the fungus had been destroyed whereas other staphylococci colonies farther away were normal famously remarking Thats funny</span>

				<span class='text'>It also affected  which causes  although this bacterium is Gram negative</span>
				<span class='text'>leming published his discovery in 1929 in the British Journal of Experimental Pathology name pmid6994200  but little attention was paid to his article</span>
				<span class='text'>Fleming continued his investigations but found that cultivating penicillium was quite difficult and that after having grown the mould it was even more difficult to isolate the antibiotic agent</span>
				<span class='text'>Flemings impression was that because of the problem of producing it in quantity and because its action appeared to be rather slow penicillin would not be important in treating infection</span>
				<span class='text'>Fleming also became convinced that penicillin would not last long enough in the human body in vivo to kill bacteria effectively</span>
				<span class='text'>Many clinical tests were inconclusive probably because it had been used as a surface antiseptic</span>
				<span class='text'>In the 1930s Fleming’s trials occasionally showed more promise   and he continued until 1940 to try to interest a chemist skilled enough to further ine usable penicillin</span>
				<span class='text'>Fleming finally abandoned penicillin and not long after he did  and  at the  in Oxford took up researching and mass producing it with funds from the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>and British governments</span>
				<span class='text'>They started mass production after the bombing of </span>

				<span class='text'>n Oxford  and  discovered how to isolate and concentrate penicillin</span>
				<span class='text'>Abraham was the first to propose the correct structure of penicillin</span>
				<span class='text'>n October 1943 Abraham proposed a molecular structure which included a cyclic formation containing three carbon atoms and one nitrogen atom the β lactam ring not then known in natural products</span>
				<span class='text'>This structure was not immediately published due to the restrictions of wartime secrecy and was initially strongly disputed by Sir Robert Robinson among others but it was finally confirmed in 1945 by Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin using X ray analysis</span>
				<span class='text'>Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Abraham Sir Edward Penley   Shortly after the team published its first results in 1940 Fleming telephoned  Chains head of department to say that he would be visiting within the next few days</span>
				<span class='text'>When Chain heard that Fleming was coming he remarked Good God I thought he was dead</span>
				<span class='text'>suggested transferring the active ingredient of penicillin back into water by changing its acidity</span>
				<span class='text'>This produced enough of the drug to begin testing on animals</span>
				<span class='text'>There were many more people involved in the Oxford team and at one point the entire Dunn School was involved in its production</span>
				<span class='text'>fter the team had developed a method of purifying penicillin to an effective first stable form in 1940 several clinical trials ensued and their amazing success inspired the team to develop methods for mass production and mass distribution in 1945</span>
				<span class='text'>leming was modest about his part in the development of penicillin describing his fame as the Fleming Myth and he praised Florey and Chain for transforming the laboratory curiosity into a practical drug</span>
				<span class='text'>Fleming was the first to discover the properties of the active substance giving him the privilege of naming it penicillin</span>
				<span class='text'>He also kept grew and distributed the original mould for twelve years and continued until 1940 to try to get help from any chemist who had enough skill to make penicillin</span>

				<span class='text'>Fleming was the first to push these studies further by isolating the penicillin and by being motivated enough to promote his discovery at a larger scale</span>

				<span class='text'>Fleming cautioned about the use of penicillin in his many speeches around the world</span>
				<span class='text'>He cautioned not to use penicillin unless there was a properly diagnosed reason for it to be used and that if it were used never to use too little or for too short a period since these are the circumstances under which bacterial resistance to antibiotics develops</span>
