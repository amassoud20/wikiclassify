				<span class='text'>=Early life and education==Fleming was born on 6 August  1881 at Lochfield farm near [[Darvel]], in [[Ayrshire]], Scotland</span>
				<span class='text'>He was the third of the four children of farmer Hugh Fleming (1816–1888) from his second marriage to Grace Stirling Morton (1848–1928), the daughter of a neighbouring farmer</span>
				<span class='text'>Hugh Fleming had four surviving children from his first marriage</span>
				<span class='text'>He was 59 at the time of his second marriage, and died when Alexander (known as Alex) was seven</span>

				<span class='text'>His elder brother, Tom, was already a physician and suggested to his younger sibling that he should follow the same career, and so in 1903, the younger Alexander enrolled at [[St Mary's Hospital Medical School]] in [[Paddington]]; he qualified with an [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|MBBS]] degree from the school with distinction in 1906</span>
				<span class='text'>leming had been a private in the [[London Scottish Regiment]] of the [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer Force]] since 1900,&lt;ref name=&quot;lesprixnobel&quot; /&gt; and had been a member of the rifle club at the medical school</span>
				<span class='text'>The captain of the club, wishing to retain Fleming in the team suggested that he join the research department at St Mary's, where he became assistant bacteriologist to Sir [[Almroth Wright]], a pioneer in [[vaccine]] therapy and immunology</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1908, he gained a [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]] degree with Gold Medal in [[Bacteriology]], and became a lecturer at St Mary's until 1914</span>
				<span class='text'>leming served throughout [[World War I]] as a captain in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]], and was [[Mentioned in Dispatches]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He and many of his colleagues worked in battlefield hospitals at the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in France</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1918 he returned to [[St Mary's Hospital, London|St Mary's Hospital]], where he was elected Professor of Bacteriology of the [[University of London]] in 1928</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1951 he was elected the Rector of the [[University of Edinburgh]] for a term of 3 years</span>
				<span class='text'>=Research=====Work before penicillin==={{Unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}Following World War I, Fleming actively searched for anti-bacterial agents, having witnessed the death of many soldiers from [[sepsis]] resulting from infected [[wounds]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Antiseptics]] killed the patients' immunological defences more effectively than they killed the invading bacteria</span>
				<span class='text'>In an article he submitted for the medical journal ''[[The Lancet]]'' during World War I, Fleming described an ingenious experiment, which he was able to conduct as a result of his own glass blowing skills, in which he explained why antiseptics were killing more soldiers than infection itself during World War I</span>
				<span class='text'>Antiseptics worked well on the surface, but deep wounds tended to shelter anaerobic bacteria from the antiseptic agent, and antiseptics seemed to remove beneficial agents produced that protected the patients in these cases at least as well as they removed bacteria, and did nothing to remove the bacteria that were out of reach</span>
				<span class='text'>Sir [[Almroth Wright]] strongly supported Fleming's findings, but despite this, most army physicians over the course of the war continued to use antiseptics even in cases where this worsened the condition of the patients</span>

				<span class='text'>He was already well-known from his earlier work, and had developed a reputation as a brilliant researcher, but his laboratory was often untidy</span>
				<span class='text'>On 3 September 1928, Fleming returned to his laboratory having spent August on holiday with his family</span>
				<span class='text'>Before leaving, he had stacked all his cultures of staphylococci on a bench in a corner of his laboratory</span>
				<span class='text'>On returning, Fleming noticed that one culture was contaminated with a fungus, and that the colonies of staphylococci immediately surrounding the fungus had been destroyed, whereas other staphylococci colonies farther away were normal, famously remarking ''&quot;That's funny&quot;''</span>

				<span class='text'>It also affected ''[[Neisseria gonorrhoeae]],'' which causes [[gonorrhoea]] although this bacterium is Gram-negative</span>

				<span class='text'>Fleming continued his investigations, but found that cultivating ''penicillium'' was quite difficult, and that after having grown the mould, it was even more difficult to isolate the antibiotic agent</span>
				<span class='text'>Fleming's impression was that because of the problem of producing it in quantity, and because its action appeared to be rather slow, penicillin would not be important in treating infection</span>
				<span class='text'>Fleming also became convinced that penicillin would not last long enough in the human body (''in vivo'') to kill bacteria effectively</span>
				<span class='text'>Many clinical tests were inconclusive, probably because it had been used as a surface antiseptic</span>
				<span class='text'>In the 1930s, Fleming’s trials occasionally showed more promise,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rossiter|first=Peter|title=Keith Bernard Rogers|url=http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>Fleming finally abandoned penicillin, and not long after he did, [[Howard Florey]] and [[Ernst Boris Chain]] at the [[Radcliffe Infirmary]] in Oxford took up researching and mass-producing it, with funds from the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>and British governments</span>
				<span class='text'>They started mass production after the bombing of [[Pearl Harbor]]</span>

				<span class='text'>This structure was not immediately published due to the restrictions of wartime secrecy, and was initially strongly disputed, by Sir Robert Robinson among others, but it was finally confirmed in 1945 by Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin using X-ray analysis</span>

				<span class='text'>When Chain heard that Fleming was coming, he remarked ''&quot;Good God! I thought he was dead</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;''[[Norman Heatley]] suggested transferring the active ingredient of penicillin back into water by changing its acidity</span>
				<span class='text'>This produced enough of the drug to begin testing on animals</span>
				<span class='text'>There were many more people involved in the Oxford team, and at one point the entire Dunn School was involved in its production</span>
				<span class='text'>fter the team had developed a method of purifying penicillin to an effective first stable form in 1940, several clinical trials ensued, and their amazing success inspired the team to develop methods for mass production and mass distribution in 1945</span>
				<span class='text'>leming was modest about his part in the development of penicillin, describing his fame as the ''&quot;Fleming Myth&quot;'' and he praised Florey and Chain for transforming the laboratory curiosity into a practical drug</span>
				<span class='text'>Fleming was the first to discover the properties of the active substance, giving him the privilege of naming it: penicillin</span>
				<span class='text'>He also kept, grew, and distributed the original mould for twelve years, and continued until 1940 to try to get help from any chemist who had enough skill to make penicillin</span>

				<span class='text'>Fleming was the first to push these studies further by isolating the penicillin, and by being motivated enough to promote his discovery at a larger scale</span>
				<span class='text'>Fleming also discovered very early that [[bacteria]] developed [[antibiotic resistance]] whenever too little penicillin was used or when it was used for too short a period</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Almroth Wright]] had predicted antibiotic resistance even before it was noticed during experiments</span>
				<span class='text'>Fleming cautioned about the use of penicillin in his many speeches around the world</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> ''Philadelphia Enquirer'', 17 July 1945: Brown, ''Penicillin Man'', note 43 to Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Lord Randolph Churchill|Winston Churchill's father]] paying for Fleming's education after Fleming's father saved young [[Winston Churchill|Winston]] from death is false</span>
				<span class='text'>According to the biography, ''Penicillin Man: Alexander Fleming and the Antibiotic Revolution'' by [[Kevin Brown (historian of medicine)|Kevin Brown]], Alexander Fleming, in a letter&lt;ref&gt;14 November 1945; British Library Additional Manuscripts 56115: Brown, ''Penicillin Man'', note 44 to Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; to his friend and colleague Andre Gratia,&lt;ref&gt;see Wikipedia [[Discovery of penicillin]] article entry for 1920&lt;/ref&gt; described this as &quot;A wondrous fable</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Nor did he save Winston Churchill himself during [[World War II]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Churchill was saved by [[Charles Wilson, 1st Baron Moran|Lord Moran]], using [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulphonamides]], since he had no experience with penicillin, when Churchill fell ill in [[Carthage]] in [[Tunisia]] in 1943</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' and ''[[The Morning Post]]'' on 21 December 1943 wrote that he had been saved by penicillin</span>
				<span class='text'>He was saved by the new sulphonamide drug [[sulfapyridine|Sulphapyridine]], known at the time under the research code M&amp;B 693, discovered and produced by [[May &amp; Baker|May &amp; Baker Ltd]], [[Dagenham]], [[Essex]] – a subsidiary of the French group [[Rhône-Poulenc]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In a subsequent [[radio broadcast]], Churchill referred to the new drug as &quot;This admirable M&amp;B&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;A History of May &amp; Baker 1834–1984, Alden Press 1984</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; It is highly probable that the correct information about the [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulphonamide]] did not reach the newspapers because, since the original sulphonamide antibacterial, [[Prontosil]], had been a discovery by the German laboratory [[Bayer]], and as Britain was at war with [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] at the time, it was thought better to raise British morale by associating Churchill's cure with a British discovery, penicillin</span>
