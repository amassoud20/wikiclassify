				<span class='text'>The net effect of the many changes from the 1880 census: the larger population, the data items to be collected, the Census Bureau headcount, the scheduled publications, and the use of Hollerith's electromechanical tabulators, was to reduce the time required to process the census from eight years for the [[U</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In 1896 Hollerith started his own business when he founded ''The Tabulating Machine Company''</span>
				<span class='text'>Many major census bureaus around the world leased his equipment and purchased his cards, as did major insurance companies</span>
				<span class='text'>Hollerith's machines were used for censuses in England, Italy, Germany, Russia, Austria, Canada, France, Norway, Puerto Rico, Cuba, and the Philippines, and again in the [[United States Census, 1900|1900 census]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Cruz&quot;/&gt; To improve his system, he invented the first automatic card-feed mechanism and the first [[keypunch]] (that is, a punch operated by a [[Keyboard technology|keyboard]]); a skilled operator could punch 200–300 cards per hour</span>
				<span class='text'>He also invented a [[Tabulating machine|tabulator]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The 1890 Tabulator was [[hardwired]] to operate on 1890 Census cards</span>
				<span class='text'>A [[plugboard]] control panel in his 1906 Type I Tabulator allowed it to do different jobs without being rewired</span>
				<span class='text'>These inventions were among the foundations of the data processing industry and Hollerith's punched cards (later used for recording machine-readable computer programs) continued in use for almost a century</span>
