				<span class='text'>ng}}'''Niels Henrik Abel''' ({{IPA-no|ˈɑːbɛl|lang}}; 5 August 1802 – 6 April 1829) was a [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] [[mathematician]] who made pioneering contributions in a variety of fields</span>
				<span class='text'>His most famous single result is the first complete proof demonstrating the impossibility of solving the [[general quintic equation]] in radicals</span>
				<span class='text'>This question was one of the outstanding open problems of his day, and had been unresolved for 250 years</span>
				<span class='text'>He was also an innovator in the field of [[elliptic functions]], discoverer of [[Abelian function]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite his achievements, Abel was largely unrecognized during his lifetime; he made his discoveries while living in poverty and died at the age of 26</span>
				<span class='text'>ost of his work was done in six or seven years of his working life</span>

				<span class='text'>Søren's father, Niels's grandfather, Hans Mathias Abel, was also a pastor, at [[Gjerstad]] near [[Risør]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Søren had spent his childhood at Gjerstad, and had also served as chaplain there; and after his father's death in 1804, Søren was appointed pastor at Gjerstad and the family moved there</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|alt=Postcard of Gjerstad church and rectory</span>
				<span class='text'>Postcard of Gjerstad church and rectory in 1890–95</span>
				<span class='text'>The main building of the rectory was the same as when Abel lived here</span>
				<span class='text'>]Anne Marie Simonsen was from Risør; her father, Niels Henrik Saxild Simonsen, was a tradesman and merchant ship-owner, and said to be the richest person in Risør</span>
				<span class='text'>Anne Marie had grown up with two [[Stepfamily|stepmothers]], in relatively luxurious surroundings</span>
				<span class='text'>At Gjerstad rectory, she enjoyed arranging balls and social gatherings</span>
				<span class='text'>Much suggests she was early on an alcoholic and took little interest in the upbringing of the children</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;SNL-bio&quot; /&gt;Niels Henrik and his brothers were given their schooling by their father, with handwritten books to read</span>
				<span class='text'>Interestingly, an addition table in a book of mathematics reads: 1+0=0</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;SNL-bio&quot; /&gt;===Cathedral School and Royal Frederick University===With Norwegian independence and the first election held in Norway, in 1814, Søren Abel was elected as a representative to the [[Storting]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Meetings of the Storting were held until 1866 in the main hall of the [[Oslo katedralskole|Cathedral School]] in Christiania (now known as [[Oslo]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Almost certainly, this is how he came into contact with the school, and he decided that his eldest son, Hans Mathias, should start there the following year</span>
				<span class='text'>However, when the time for his departure approached, Hans was so saddened and depressed over having to leave home that his father did not dare send him away</span>
				<span class='text'>He decided to send Niels instead</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;SNL-bio&quot; /&gt;In 1815, Niels Abel entered the Cathedral School at the age of 13</span>
				<span class='text'>His elder brother Hans joined him there a year later</span>
				<span class='text'>They shared rooms and had classes together</span>
				<span class='text'>Hans got better grades than Niels; however, a new mathematics teacher, [[Bernt Michael Holmboe]], was appointed in 1818</span>
				<span class='text'>He gave the students mathematical tasks to do at home</span>
				<span class='text'>He saw Niels Henrik's talent in mathematics, and encouraged him to study the subject to an advanced level</span>
				<span class='text'>He even gave Niels private lessons after school</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1818, Søren Abel had a public theological argument with the theologian Stener Johannes Stenersen regarding his [[catechism]] from 1806</span>
				<span class='text'>The argument was well covered in press</span>
				<span class='text'>Søren was given the nickname &quot;Abel Treating&quot; ''(Norwegian: &quot;Abel Spandabel&quot;)''</span>
				<span class='text'>Niels' reaction to the quarrel was said to have been &quot;excessive gaiety&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time, Søren also almost faced impeachment after insulting [[Carsten Anker]], the host of the [[Norwegian Constituent Assembly]]; and in September 1818 he returned to Gjerstad with his political career in ruins</span>
				<span class='text'>He began drinking heavily and died only two years later, in 1820, aged 48</span>
				<span class='text'>ernt Michael Holmboe supported Niels Henrik Abel with a scholarship to remain at the school and raised money from his friends to enable him to study at the [[University of Oslo|Royal Frederick University]]</span>
				<span class='text'>hen Abel entered the university in 1821, he was already the most knowledgeable mathematician in Norway</span>
				<span class='text'>Holmboe had nothing more he could teach him and Abel had studied all the latest mathematical literature in the university library</span>
				<span class='text'>During that time, Abel started working on the [[quintic equation]] in radicals</span>
				<span class='text'>Mathematicians had been looking for a solution to this problem for over 250 years</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1821, Abel thought he had found the solution</span>
				<span class='text'>The two professors of mathematics in Christiania, Søren Rasmussen and [[Christopher Hansteen]], found no errors in Abel's formulas, and sent the work on to the leading mathematician in the Nordic countries, [[Ferdinand Degen]] in Copenhagen</span>
				<span class='text'>He too found no faults but still doubted that the solution, which so many outstanding mathematicians had sought for so long, could really have been found by an unknown student in far-off Christiania</span>
				<span class='text'>Degen noted, however, Abel's unusually sharp mind, and believed that such a talented young man should not waste his abilities on such a &quot;sterile object&quot; as the fifth degree equation, but rather on [[elliptic function]]s and [[Transcendental number theory|transcendence]]; for then, wrote Degen, he would &quot;discover Magellanian thoroughfares to large portions of a vast analytical ocean&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;SNL-bio&quot; /&gt; Degen asked Abel to give a numerical example of his method</span>
				<span class='text'>While trying to provide an example, Abel found a mistake in his paper</span>

				<span class='text'>Abel would later view Ms</span>
				<span class='text'>Hansteen as his second mother</span>
				<span class='text'>While living here, Abel helped his younger brother, Peder Abel, through [[examen artium]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also helped his sister Elisabeth to find work in the town</span>
				<span class='text'>n early 1823, Niels Abel published his first article in &quot;Magazin for Naturvidenskaberne&quot;, Norway's first scientific journal, which had been co-founded by Professor Hansteen</span>
				<span class='text'>Abel published several articles, but the journal soon realized that this was not material for the common reader</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1823, Abel also wrote a paper in French</span>
				<span class='text'>It was &quot;a general representation of the possibility to integrate all differential formulas&quot; (''Norwegian: en alminnelig Fremstilling af Muligheten at integrere alle mulige Differential-Formler)''</span>

				<span class='text'>]In mid-1823, Professor Rasmussen gave Abel a gift of 100 [[speciedaler]] so he could travel to [[Copenhagen]] and visit Ferdinand Degen and other mathematicians there</span>
				<span class='text'>While in Copenhagen, Abel did some work on [[Fermat's Last Theorem]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Abel's uncle, Peder Mandrup Tuxen, lived at the naval base in [[Christianshavn]], Copenhagen, and at a ball there Niels Abel met Christine Kemp, his future fiancée</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1824, Christine moved to [[Son, Norway|Son]], Norway to work as a governess and the couple got engaged over Christmas</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;SNL-bio&quot; /&gt;After returning from Copenhagen, Abel applied for a government scholarship in order to visit top mathematicians in Germany and France, but he was instead granted 200 speciedaler yearly for two years, to stay in Christiania and study German and French</span>
				<span class='text'>In the next two years, he was promised a scholarship of 600 speciedaler yearly and he would then be permitted to travel abroad</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;SNL-bio&quot; /&gt; While studying these languages, Abel published his first notable work in 1824, ''Mémoire sur les équations algébriques où on démontre l'impossibilité de la résolution de l'équation générale du cinquième degré''&lt;ref&gt;http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>For, in 1823, Abel had at last proved the impossibility of solving the quintic equation in radicals (now referred to as the [[Abel–Ruffini theorem]])</span>
				<span class='text'>However, this paper was in an abstruse and difficult form, in part because he had restricted himself to only six pages, in order to save money on printing</span>
				<span class='text'>A more detailed [[Mathematical proof|proof]] was published in 1826 in the first volume of ''[[Crelle's Journal]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1825, Abel wrote a personal letter to [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|King Carl Johan of Norway/Sweden]] requesting permission to travel abroad</span>
				<span class='text'>He was granted this permission, and in September 1825 he left Christiania together with four friends from university (Christian P</span>
				<span class='text'> Boeck, Balthazar M</span>
				<span class='text'>Keilhau, Nicolay B</span>
				<span class='text'>Møller and Otto Tank)</span>
				<span class='text'>These four friends of Abel were traveling to Berlin and to the Alps to study geology</span>
				<span class='text'>Abel wanted to follow them to Copenhagen and from there make his way to Göttingen</span>
				<span class='text'>The terms for his scholarship stipulated that he was to visit [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] in [[Göttingen]] and then continue to Paris</span>
				<span class='text'>However, when he got as far as Copenhagen he changed his plans</span>
				<span class='text'>He wanted to follow his friends to Berlin instead, intending to visit Göttingen and Paris afterwards</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;SNL-bio&quot; /&gt;On the way, he visited the astronomer [[Heinrich Christian Schumacher]] in Altona, now a district of Hamburg</span>
				<span class='text'>He then spent four months in Berlin, where he became well acquainted with [[August Leopold Crelle]], who was then about to publish his mathematical journal, [[Crelle's Journal|Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This project was warmly encouraged by Abel, who contributed much to the success of the venture</span>
				<span class='text'>Abel contributed seven articles to it in its first year</span>
				<span class='text'>rom Berlin Abel also followed his friends to the Alps</span>
				<span class='text'>He went to [[Leipzig]] and [[Freiberg, Saxony|Freiberg]] to visit [[Georg Amadeus Carl Friedrich Naumann]] and his brother the mathematician August Naumann</span>
				<span class='text'>In Freiberg Abel did research in the theory of functions, particularly, [[Elliptic function|elliptic]], [[Hyperelliptic function|hyperelliptic]], and a new class now known as [[abelian function]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>rom Freiberg they went on to Dresden, Prague, Vienna, Trieste, Venice, Verona, Bolzano, Innsbruck, Luzern and Basel</span>
				<span class='text'>From July 1826 Abel traveled on his own from Basel to Paris</span>
				<span class='text'>Abel had sent most of his work to Berlin to be published in Crelle's Journal, but he had saved what he regarded as his most important work for the [[French Academy of Sciences]], a theorem on addition of algebraic differentials</span>
				<span class='text'>With the help of Johan Gørbitz he found an apartment in Paris and continued his work on the theorem</span>
				<span class='text'>He finished in October 1826, and submitted it to the academy</span>
				<span class='text'>It was to be reviewed by [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Abel's work was scarcely known in Paris, and his modesty restrained him from proclaiming his research</span>
				<span class='text'>The theorem was put aside and forgotten until his death</span>
				<span class='text'>bel's limited finances finally compelled him to abandon his tour in January 1827</span>
				<span class='text'>He returned to Berlin, and was offered a position as editor of Crelle's Journal, but opted out</span>
				<span class='text'>By May 1827 he was back in Norway</span>
				<span class='text'>His tour abroad was viewed as a failure</span>
				<span class='text'>He had not visited Gauss in Göttingen and he had not published anything in Paris</span>
				<span class='text'>His scholarship was therefore not renewed and he had to take up a private loan in [[Norges Bank]] of 200 spesidaler</span>
				<span class='text'>He never repaid this loan</span>
				<span class='text'>He also started tutoring</span>
				<span class='text'>He continued to send most of his work to Crelle's Journal</span>
				<span class='text'>But in mid-1828 he published, in rivalry with [[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi|Carl Jacobi]], an important work on elliptic functions in [[Astronomische Nachrichten]] in Altona</span>
				<span class='text'>==Death===While in Paris, Abel contracted [[tuberculosis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>During the Christmas of 1828, he traveled by sled to [[Froland]] to visit his fiancée</span>
				<span class='text'>He became seriously ill on the journey and, although a temporary improvement allowed the couple to enjoy the holiday together, he died relatively soon after on 6 April 1829, just two days before a letter arrived from August Crelle</span>
				<span class='text'>Crelle had been searching for a new job for Abel in Berlin, and had actually managed to have him appointed as a professor at the [[University of Berlin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Crelle wrote to Abel to tell him the good news, but it came too late</span>
				<span class='text'>=Contributions to mathematics==Abel showed that there is no general [[algebraic function|algebraic]] solution for the roots of a [[quintic equation]], or any general [[polynomial equation]] of degree greater than four, in terms of explicit algebraic operations</span>
				<span class='text'>To do this, he invented (independently of [[Galois]]) an extremely important branch of mathematics known as [[History of group theory|group theory]], which is invaluable not only in many areas of mathematics, but for much of [[physics]] as well</span>
				<span class='text'>Abel sent a paper on the unsolvability of the quintic equation to [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], who proceeded to discard without a glance what he believed to be the worthless work of a crank</span>

				<span class='text'>nstead, I must mention the very different type of memorial that was in fact erected to Abel in [[Oslo|Christiania]] and which must greatly disappoint anyone familiar with his nature</span>
				<span class='text'>On a towering, steep block of granite a youthful athlete of the Byronic type steps over two greyish sacrificial victims, his direction toward the heavens</span>
				<span class='text'>If needed be, one might take the hero to be a symbol of the human spirit, but one ponders the deeper significance of the two monsters in vain</span>
				<span class='text'>Are they the conquered quintic equations or elliptic functions? Or the sorrows and cares of his everyday life? The pedestal of the monument bears, in immense letters, the inscription ABEL</span>
