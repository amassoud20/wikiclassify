				<span class='text'>Some modern writers {{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} claim that this stay would influence all his later writings, as [[Luis Ponce de León|Fray Luis de León]] taught biblical studies ([[Exegesis]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic]]) at the University: León was one of the foremost experts in Biblical Studies then and had written an important and controversial translation of the [[Song of Songs]] into [[Spanish language|Spanish]]</span>

				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|left|Statues representing John of the Cross and Teresa of Ávila in Beas de Segura]]John was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] a [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]] in 1567, and then indicated his intent to join the strict [[Carthusian]] Order, which appealed to him because of its encouragement of solitary and silent contemplation</span>
				<span class='text'>A journey from Salamanca to [[Medina del Campo]], probably in September 1567, changed this</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;E</span>
				<span class='text'>Allison Peers (1943, p</span>
				<span class='text'>16) suggests that the journey was in order to visit a nearby Carthusian monastery; Richard P</span>
				<span class='text'>Hardy, ''The Life of St John of the Cross: Search for Nothing'' (London: DLT, 1982), p</span>
				<span class='text'>24, argues that the reason was for John to say his first mass&lt;/ref&gt; In Medina he met the charismatic Carmelite nun [[Teresa of Ávila|Teresa of Jesus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>She was in Medina to found the second of her convents for women</span>

				<span class='text'>Allison Peers, ''Spirit of Flame: A Study of St John of the Cross'' (London: SCM Press, 1943), p</span>
				<span class='text'>16&lt;/ref&gt; She immediately talked to him about her reformation projects for the Order: she was seeking to restore the purity of the Carmelite Order by restarting observance of its &quot;Primitive Rule&quot; of 1209, observance of which had been relaxed by [[Pope Eugene IV]] in 1432</span>
				<span class='text'>nder this Rule, much of the day and night was to be spent in the recitation of the [[Liturgy of the Hours|choir offices]], study and devotional reading, the celebration of Mass and times of solitude</span>
				<span class='text'>For the friars, time was to be spent evangelizing the population around the monastery</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tillyer, p</span>
				<span class='text'>}} Total [[abstinence]] from meat and lengthy [[fasting]] was to be observed from the [[Feast of the Cross#September 14|Feast of the Exaltation of the Cross]] (September 14) until [[Easter]]</span>
				<span class='text'>There were to be long periods of silence, especially between [[Compline]] and [[Prime (liturgy)|Prime]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Coarser, shorter habits, more simple than those worn since 1432, were to be worn</span>

				<span class='text'>27&lt;/ref&gt; They were to follow the [[injunction]] against the wearing of shoes (also mitigated in 1432)</span>
				<span class='text'>It was from this last observance that the followers of Teresa among the Carmelites were becoming known as &quot;discalced&quot;, i</span>

				<span class='text'>eresa asked John to delay his entry into the Carthusians and to follow her</span>
				<span class='text'>Having spent a final year studying in Salamanca, in August 1568 John traveled with Teresa from Medina to [[Valladolid]], where Teresa intended to found another monastery of nuns</span>
				<span class='text'>Having spent some time with Teresa in Valladolid, learning more about this new form of Carmelite life, in October 1568, accompanied by Friar Antonio de Jesús de Heredia, John left Valladolid to found a new monastery for friars, the first for men following Teresa's principles</span>
				<span class='text'>They were given the use of a derelict house at [[Duruelo]] (midway between Ávila and Salamanca), which had been donated to Teresa</span>
				<span class='text'>On 28 November 1568, the monastery&lt;ref&gt;The monastery may have contained three men, according to E</span>
				<span class='text'>Allison Peers (1943), p</span>
				<span class='text'>27, or five, according to Richard P</span>
				<span class='text'>Hardy, ''The Life of St John of the Cross: Search for Nothing'' (London: DLT, 1982), p</span>
				<span class='text'>35&lt;/ref&gt; was established, and on that same day John changed his name to '''John of the Cross'''</span>
				<span class='text'>oon after, in June 1570, the friars found the house at Duruelo too small, and so moved to the nearby town of [[Mancera de Abajo]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After moving on from this community, John set up a new community at [[Pastrana, Spain|Pastrana]] (October 1570), and a community at [[Alcalá de Henares]], which was to be a house of studies for the academic training of the friars</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1572&lt;ref&gt;The month generally given is May</span>

				<span class='text'>Allison Peers, ''Complete Works'' Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>I (1943, xxvi), agreeing with P</span>
				<span class='text'>Silverio, thinks it must have been substantially later than this, though certainly before 27 September</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; he arrived in Ávila, at the invitation of Teresa, who had been appointed [[prior]]ess of the Monastery of the Visitation there in 1571</span>
				<span class='text'>John became the [[spiritual director]] and [[confessor]] for Teresa and the other 130 nuns there, as well for as a wide range of laypeople in the city</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Kavanaugh&quot; /&gt; In 1574, John accompanied Teresa in the foundation of a new monastery in [[Segovia]], returning to Avila after staying there a week</span>
				<span class='text'>Beyond this, though, John seems to have remained in Ávila between 1572 and 1577</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|Drawing of the crucifixion by John of the Cross, which inspired [[Salvador Dalí]]]]One day at some point between 1574 and 1577, while praying in the Monastery of the Incarnation in Ávila, in a loft overlooking the sanctuary, John had a vision of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucified Christ]], which led him to create his famous drawing of Christ &quot;from above&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1641, this drawing was placed in a small [[monstrance]] and kept in Ávila</span>
				<span class='text'>This drawing inspired the artist [[Salvador Dalí]]'s 1951 work ''[[Christ of Saint John of the Cross]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>== The height of Carmelite tensions ===The years 1575–77, however, saw a great increase in the tensions among the Spanish Carmelite friars over the reforms of Teresa and John</span>
				<span class='text'>Since 1566 the reforms had been overseen by [[canonical visitation|Canonical Visitors]] from the [[Dominican Order]], with one appointed to Castile and a second to Andalusia</span>
				<span class='text'>These Visitors had substantial powers: they could move the members of religious communities from house to house and even [[ecclesiastical province|province]] to province</span>
				<span class='text'>They could assist [[religious superior]]s in their office, and could depute other superiors from either the Dominicans or Carmelites</span>
				<span class='text'>In Castile, the Visitor was Pedro Fernández, who prudently balanced the interests of the Discalced Carmelites against those of the friars and nuns who did not desire reform</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;He is possibly the same Pedro Fernández who became the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Ávila#Leadership|Bishop of Ávila]] in 1581</span>
				<span class='text'>It was he who appointed Teresa in 1571 as prioress in Ávila, but who also enjoyed good relations with the Carmelite [[provincial superior|Prior Provincial]] of Castile</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In Andalusia to the south, however, where the Visitor was Francisco Vargas, tensions rose due to his clear preference for the Discalced friars</span>
				<span class='text'>Vargas asked them to make foundations in various cities, in explicit contradiction of orders from the Carmelite [[Superior general|Prior General]] against their expansion in Andalusia</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, a [[General Chapter]] of the Carmelite Order was convened at [[Piacenza]] in Italy in May 1576, out of concern that events in Spain were getting out of hand, which concluded by ordering the total suppression of the Discalced houses</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kavanaugh (1991) states that this was all the Discalced houses founded in Andalusia</span>
				<span class='text'>E</span>
				<span class='text'>Allison Peers, ''Complete Works'', Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>I, p</span>
				<span class='text'>xxvii (1943) states that this was all the Discalced monasteries but two</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;This measure was not immediately enforced</span>
				<span class='text'>For one thing, [[Philip II of Spain|King Philip II of Spain]] was supportive of some of Teresa's reforms, and so was not immediately willing to grant the necessary permission to enforce this ordinance</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, the Discalced friars also found support from the papal [[nuncio]] to King Philip II, {{Ill|it|Nicolò Ormaneto}}, [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Padua|Bishop of Padua]], who still had ultimate power as nuncio to visit and reform religious Orders</span>
				<span class='text'>When asked by the Discalced friars to intervene, Ormaneto replaced Vargas as Visitor of the Carmelites in Andalusia (where the troubles had begun) with [[Jerónimo Gracián]], a priest from the [[University of Alcalá]], who was in fact a Discalced Carmelite friar himself</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Kavanaugh&quot; /&gt; The nuncio's protection helped John himself avoid problems for a time</span>
				<span class='text'>In January 1576, John was arrested in Medina del Campo by some Carmelite friars</span>
				<span class='text'>However, through the nuncio's intervention, John was soon released</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Kavanaugh&quot; /&gt; When Ormaneto died on 18 June 1577, however, John was left without protection, and the friars opposing his reforms gained the upper hand</span>

				<span class='text'>John had received an order from some of his superiors, opposed to reform, ordering him to leave Ávila and return to his original house, but John had refused on the basis that his reform work had been approved by the Spanish nuncio, a higher authority than these superiors</span>

				<span class='text'>Thompson points out that many earlier biographers have stated the number of friars at Toledo to be 80, but this is simply taken from Crisogono's Spanish biography</span>
				<span class='text'>Alain Cugno (1982) gives the number of friars as 800 — which Thompson assumes is a misprint</span>
				<span class='text'>However, as Thompson details, the actual number of friars has been reconstructed from comparing various extant documents that in 1576, 42 friars belonged to the house, with only about 23 of them resident, the remainder being absent for various reasons</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; John was brought before a court of friars, accused of disobeying the ordinances of Piacenza</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite John's argument that he had not disobeyed the ordinances, he received a punishment of imprisonment</span>
				<span class='text'>He was jailed in the monastery,  where he was kept under a brutal regimen that included public lashing before the community at least weekly, and severe isolation in a tiny stifling cell measuring ten feet by six feet, barely large enough for his body</span>
				<span class='text'>Except when rarely permitted an oil lamp, he had to stand on a bench to read his [[breviary]] by the light through the hole into the adjoining room</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tillyer, p</span>

				<span class='text'>The Hospital still exists, and is today a municipal art gallery in Toledo</span>

				<span class='text'>In October 1578 he joined a meeting at [[Almodóvar del Campo]] of the supporters of reform, increasingly known as the [[Discalced Carmelites]]</span>
				<span class='text'>There, in part as a result of the opposition faced from other Carmelites in recent years, they decided to demand from the Pope their formal separation from the rest of the Carmelite Order</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Kavanaugh&quot;/&gt;At this meeting John was appointed superior of El Calvario, an isolated monastery of around thirty friars in the mountains about 6 miles away{{sfn|Thompson, p</span>
				<span class='text'>17}} from [[Beas, Spain|Beas]] in Andalusia</span>
				<span class='text'>During this time he befriended the nun [[Ana de Jesús]], superior of the Discalced nuns at Beas, through his visits every Saturday to the town</span>
				<span class='text'>While at El Calvario he composed his first version of his commentary on his poem, ''The Spiritual Canticle'', perhaps at the request of the nuns in Beas</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1579 he moved to [[Baeza]], a town of around 50,000 people, to serve as [[rector (academic)|rector]] of a new college, the Colegio de San Basilio, to support the studies of Discalced friars in Andalusia</span>
				<span class='text'>This opened on 13 June 1579</span>
				<span class='text'>He remained in post there until 1582, spending much of his time as a spiritual director for the friars and townspeople</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Reliquary of John of the Cross in Úbeda, Spain]]In November 1581, John was sent by Teresa to help Ana de Jesus in founding a convent in Granada</span>
				<span class='text'>Arriving in January 1582, she set up a monastery of nuns, while John stayed in the friars' monastery of Los Martires, beside the Alhambra, becoming its prior in March 1582</span>

				<span class='text'>n February 1585, John travelled to [[Málaga]] and established a monastery of Discalced nuns there</span>
				<span class='text'>In May 1585, at the General Chapter of the Discalced Carmelites in Lisbon, John was elected Provincial Vicar of Andalusia, a post which required him to travel frequently, making annual visitations of the houses of friars and nuns in Andalusia</span>
				<span class='text'>During this time he founded seven new monasteries in the region, and is estimated to have travelled around 25,000&amp;nbsp;km</span>

				<span class='text'>This would have been largely by foot or by mule, given the strict rules which governed the way in which Discalced friars were permitted to travel</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In June 1588, he was elected third Councillor to the Vicar General for the Discalced Carmelites, Father Nicolas Doria</span>
				<span class='text'>To fulfill this role, he had to return to Segovia in Castile, where in this capacity he was also prior of the monastery</span>
				<span class='text'>After disagreeing in 1590-1 with some of Doria's remodeling of the leadership of the Discalced Carmelite Order, though, John was removed from his post in Segovia, and sent by Doria in June 1591 to an isolated monastery in Andalusia called La Peñuela</span>
				<span class='text'>There he fell ill, and traveled to the monastery at [[Úbeda, Spain|Úbeda]] for treatment</span>
				<span class='text'>His condition worsened, however, and he died there on 14 December 1591, of [[erysipelas]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Kavanaugh&quot; /&gt;== Veneration ==The morning after John’s death, huge numbers of the townspeople of Úbeda entered the monastery to view John’s body; in the crush, many were able to take home parts of his habit</span>
				<span class='text'>He was initially buried at [[Úbeda]], but, at the request of the monastery in Segovia, his body was secretly moved there in 1593</span>
				<span class='text'>The people of Úbeda, however, unhappy at this change, sent representative to petition the pope to move the body back to its original resting place</span>
				<span class='text'>Pope Clement VIII, impressed by the petition, issued a Brief on 15 October 1596 ordering the return of the body to Ubeda</span>
				<span class='text'>Eventually, in a compromise, the superiors of the Discalced Carmelites decided that the monastery at Úbeda would receive one leg and one arm of the corpse from Segovia (the monastery at Úbeda had already kept one leg in 1593, and the other arm had been removed as the corpse passed through Madrid in 1593, to form a relic there)</span>
				<span class='text'>A hand and a leg remain visible in a reliquary at the Oratory of San Juan de la Cruz in Úbeda, a monastery built in 1627 though connected to the original Discalced monastery in the town founded in 1587</span>

				<span class='text'>There, they were venerated until 1647, when on orders from Rome designed to prevent the veneration of remains without official approval, the remains were buried in the ground</span>
				<span class='text'> In the 1930s they were disinterred, and now sit in a side chapel in a marble case above a special altar built in that decade</span>

				<span class='text'>When his feast day was added to the [[General Roman Calendar]] in 1738, it was assigned to 24 November, since his date of death was impeded by the then-existing [[octave (liturgical)|octave]] of the [[Feast of the Immaculate Conception]]</span>

				<span class='text'>The numerical divisions in the work, still used by modern editions of the text, were introduced by Salablanca (they were not in John's original writings) in order to help make the work more manageable for the reader</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Kavanaugh&quot;/&gt; This edition does not contain the ''Spiritual Canticle'' however, and also omits or adapts certain passages, perhaps for fear of falling foul of the Inquisition</span>
				<span class='text'>he ''Spiritual Canticle'' was first included in the 1630 edition, produced by Fray Jeronimo de San José, at Madrid</span>
				<span class='text'>This edition was largely followed by later editors, although editions in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries gradually included a few more poems and letters</span>

				<span class='text'>It is the 1618 image, though, which was influential on later depictions of the 'Mount', such as in the 1748 Venice edition and 1858 Genoa editions of John's work</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;]] St</span>
				<span class='text'>John of the Cross is considered one of the foremost poets in the [[Spanish language]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Although his complete poems add up to fewer than 2500 verses, two of them — the ''[[Spiritual Canticle]]'' and the ''[[Dark Night of the Soul]]'' — are widely considered masterpieces of Spanish poetry, both for their formal [[Stylistics (linguistics)|stylistic]] point of view and their rich [[symbol]]ism and imagery</span>
				<span class='text'>His theological works often consist of commentaries on these poems</span>
				<span class='text'>All the works were written between 1578 and his death in 1591, meaning there is great consistency in the views presented in them</span>
				<span class='text'>he ''Spiritual Canticle'' is an [[eclogue]] in which the bride (representing the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]) searches for the bridegroom (representing [[Christian views of Jesus|Jesus Christ]]), and is anxious at having lost him; both are filled with joy upon reuniting</span>
				<span class='text'>It can be seen as a free-form Spanish version of the [[Song of Songs]] at a time when translations of the Bible into the vernacular were forbidden</span>
				<span class='text'>The first 31 stanzas of the poem were composed in 1578 while John was imprisoned in Toledo</span>
				<span class='text'>It was read after his escape by the nuns at Beas, who made copies of these stanzas</span>
				<span class='text'>Over the following years, John added some extra stanzas</span>
				<span class='text'>Today, two versions exist: one with 39 stanzas and one with 40, although with some of the stanzas ordered differently</span>
				<span class='text'>The first redaction of the commentary on the poem was written in 1584, at the request of Madre Ana de Jesus, when she was prioress of the Discalced Carmelite nuns in Granada</span>
				<span class='text'>A second redaction, which contains more detail, was written in 1585-6</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Kavanaugh&quot;/&gt;The ''Dark Night'' (from which the [[Dark Night of the Soul|spiritual term]] takes its name) narrates the journey of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] from her bodily home to her union with [[God]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It happens during the night, which represents the hardships and difficulties she meets in detachment from the world and reaching the light of the union with the Creator</span>
				<span class='text'>There are several steps in this night, which are related in successive stanzas</span>
				<span class='text'>The main idea of the poem can be seen as the painful experience that people endure as they seek to grow in spiritual maturity and union with God</span>
				<span class='text'>The poem of this title was likely written in 1578 or 1579</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1584-5, John wrote a commentary on the first two stanzas and first line of the third stanza of the poem</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Kavanaugh&quot; /&gt;The ''[[Ascent of Mount Carmel]]'' is a more systematic study of the ascetical endeavour of a soul looking for perfect union, God and the [[mysticism|mystical]] events happening along the way</span>
				<span class='text'>Although it begins as a commentary on the poem &quot;The Dark Night&quot;, it rapidly drops this format, having commented on the first two stanzas of the poem, and becomes a treatise</span>
				<span class='text'>It was composed sometime between 1581 and 1585</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Kavanaug&gt;Kavanaugh, ''The Collected Works of St John of the Cross'', 34</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;A four-stanza work, ''Living Flame of Love'', describes a greater [[intimacy]], as the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] responds to God's love</span>
				<span class='text'>It was written in a first redaction at Granada between 1585-6, apparently in two weeks,&lt;ref name=Kavanau&gt;Kavanaugh, ''The Collected Works of St John of the Cross'', 634</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and in a mostly identical second redaction at La Peñuela in 1591</span>
				<span class='text'>hese, together with his ''Dichos de Luz y Amor'' (or &quot;Sayings of Light and Love&quot;) and [[Teresa of Ávila|St</span>
				<span class='text'>Teresa]]'s writings, are the most important mystical works in Spanish, and have deeply influenced later spiritual writers all around the world</span>
				<span class='text'>Among these are [[T</span>
				<span class='text'>S</span>
				<span class='text'>Eliot]], [[Thérèse de Lisieux]], [[Edith Stein]] (Teresa Benedicta of the Cross) and [[Thomas Merton]]</span>
				<span class='text'>John has also influenced philosophers ([[Jacques Maritain]]), theologians ([[Hans Urs von Balthasar]]), [[pacifists]] ([[Dorothy Day]], [[Daniel Berrigan]] and [[Philip Berrigan]]) and artists ([[Salvador Dalí]])</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Pope John Paul II]] wrote his theological dissertation on the mystical theology of Saint John of the Cross</span>
				<span class='text'>= Intellectual influences ==Working out the main influences on John’s thought has been an ongoing debate</span>
				<span class='text'>== Scripture ===In the first place, John was clearly influenced by the [[Bible]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Scriptural images are common in both his poems and prose—in total, there are 1,583 explicit and 115 implicit quotations from the Bible in his works</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Tyler&gt;{{cite book |last=Tyler|first=Peter|title=St John of the Cross|year=2010|publisher=Continuum|location=New York}}, p</span>
				<span class='text'>116&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of the [[Song of Songs]] on the ''Spiritual Canticle'' has often been noted, both in terms of the structure of the poem, with its dialogue between two lovers, the account of their difficulties in meeting each other and the &quot;offstage chorus&quot; that comments on this action, and also in terms of the imagery of pomegranates, wine cellar, turtle dove and lilies, for example, which echoes that of the ''Song of Songs''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Tyler /&gt;In addition, John shows at occasional points the influence of the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This demonstrates how John, steeped in the language and rituals of the Church, drew at times on the phrases and language here</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;This occurs in the ''Living Flame'' at 1</span>
				<span class='text'>6 and 2</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>See John Sullivan, 'Night and Light: the Poet John of the Cross and the Exultet of the Easter Liturgy', ''Ephemerides Carmeliticae'', 30:1 (1979), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>52-68</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;=== Early studies ===In order to gain a better understanding of the intellectual influences to which John was exposed in his formative years (and so to isolate what shaped his unusual theology), many scholars have tried to reconstruct John's likely course of studies while he was at [[Salamanca]] between 1563 and 1567, living at the Carmelite College of San Andrès and studying at the [[University of Salamanca]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It has been widely acknowledged in the 20th century to be most likely that John would have received teaching both from the College of San Andres and from Salamanca University</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;This is contrary to the seventeenth-century biographies, which do not mention any classes at the College of San Andrès</span>
				<span class='text'>This thesis was proposed by both Jean Baruzi, ''Saint Jean de la Croix'' (1924), and Crisgono de Jesus Sacramentado, ''San Juan de la Cruz'' (1929)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;If taught at the College of San Andrès, John would have been exposed to the teachings of both [[Michael of Bologna]] and [[John Baconthorpe]], with the Spanish Carmelites of the day concentrating more on Baconthorpe's thought</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Crisogono, 1958, p</span>
				<span class='text'>35&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, no clear signs of the influence of either writer in John's works</span>
				<span class='text'>Perhaps no more can be said of the influence of Baconthorpe than that, given that he was a &quot;subtle and eclectic scholar who did not hesitate to disagree with [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] on many important issues&quot;, it might be &quot;that acquaintance with his works may have helped John to avoid any slavish adherence to Thomistic doctrines&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Steven Payne, ''John of the Cross and the Cognitive Value of Mysticism: An Analysis of Sanjuanist Teaching and its Philosophical Implications for Contemporary Discussions of Mystical Experience'' (1990), p</span>
				<span class='text'>5&lt;/ref&gt;In the University itself, there is widely acknowledged to have existed a range of intellectual positions</span>
				<span class='text'>Academic positions in John's time included Chairs of St</span>
				<span class='text'>Thomas, Chairs of [[Duns Scotus|Scotus]] and [[Guillaume Durand|Durandus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Crisogono (1958), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>33-35&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, it is assumed that John would have been educated here in the thought of Thomas Aquinas, explaining the influence of Thomas on much of the scholastic framework of his writings</span>
				<span class='text'>owever, the belief that John was taught at both the Carmelite College of San Andrès and at the University of Salamanca has been criticised</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;By L</span>
				<span class='text'>Rodríguez-San Pedro Bezares, 'La Formación Universitaria de Juan de la Cruz', ''Actas del Congreso Internacional Sanjuanista'' (Valladolid, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; He argues, firstly, that it is unclear whether there were in fact lectures in arts and theology at the College of San Andrès before 1571, that a reconstruction of the typical timetable of teaching at the University of Salamanca shows that there would have been little time for extra teaching at the College of the San Andrès, and that what therefore happened at San Andrès (if indeed it happened at all) is therefore likely to have taken the form of rehearsals, preparation of classes, and not in an official form — making the idea that John received systematic exposure to Baconthorpe less likely</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bezares, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>14-23&lt;/ref&gt; More controversially, Bezares calls into question whether John even studied theology at the University of Salamanca</span>
				<span class='text'>The philosophy courses John probably took in logic, natural and moral philosophy, can be reconstructed, but Bezares argues that John in fact abandoned his studies at Salamanca in 1568 to join Teresa, rather than having graduated, meaning that he did not study theology in Salamanca</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bezares, p19&lt;/ref&gt;Another claim frequently made about John's time in Salamanca, by scholars trying to explain the origins of John's mystical thought, is that it was here he was exposed in detail to mystical thought</span>
				<span class='text'>In the first biography of John, published in 1628, it is claimed, on the basis of information from John's fellow students, that he in 1567 made a special study of mystical writers, in particular of Pseudo-Dionysius and [[Pope Gregory I|Saint Gregory the Great]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;The 1628 biography of John is by Quiroga</span>
				<span class='text'>The information is from Crisogono (1958), p</span>
				<span class='text'>38&lt;/ref&gt; Much weight has been put on this evidence by later writers</span>
				<span class='text'>However, others have doubted the veracity of this anecdote, even though they do not dispute that John may have studied mystical theology in this period</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Eulogio Pacho (1969), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>56-59; Steven Payne, ''John of the Cross and the Cognitive Value of Mysticism: An Analysis of Sanjuanist Teaching and its Philosophical Implications for Contemporary Discussions of Mystical Experience'' (1990), p</span>
				<span class='text'>14, n</span>
				<span class='text'>7)&lt;/ref&gt;In short, there is little consensus from John's early years on potential influences on him</span>
				<span class='text'>Although a list of certain theologians about whom John may well have been taught can be drawn up, the evidence is not sufficient to make firm judgements on who may have influenced John</span>
				<span class='text'>== Pseudo-Dionysius ===It has rarely been disputed that the overall structure of John’s mystical theology, and his language of the union of the soul with God, is influenced by the pseudo-Dionysian tradition</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;John mentions Dionysius explicitly four times—S2</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>; N2</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>; CB14-15</span>
				<span class='text'>6; Ll3-3</span>
				<span class='text'>9</span>
				<span class='text'>Luis Girón-Negrón, 'Dionysian thought in sixteenth-century Spanish mystical theology', ''Modern Theology'', 24(4), (2008), p699&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has not been clear whether John might have had direct access to the writings of pseudo-Dionysius, or whether this influence may have been mediated through various later authors</span>
				<span class='text'>he main conduit of Dionysian spirituality into ascetic-mystical literature on contemplative prayer in sixteenth-century prayer (such as that by John of the Cross and [[Teresa of Ávila]]) appears to have been through the ''recogido'' tradition of [[Francisco de Osuna]], [[Bernardino de Laredo]] and others</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Luis Girón-Negrón, 'Dionysian thought in sixteenth-century Spanish mystical theology'</span>
				<span class='text'>''Modern Theology'', 24(4), (2008), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>693–706</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Osuna’s focus on recogimiento (recollecting or gathering of the senses) as a means of prayer, bears similarity to John’s discussion of prayer, and may have been an influence</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Nieto, ''Mystic, Rebel, Saint: A Study of St</span>
				<span class='text'>John of the Cross'', (1979), p</span>
				<span class='text'>130&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of Spanish writing, it is notable that although the second half of the sixteenth century produced many great mystics, mysticism was not common in Spain before that</span>
				<span class='text'>== Medieval mystics ===It is widely acknowledged that John may well have been influenced by the writings of other medieval mystics, though there is much debate about the exact thought which may have influenced him, and about how he might have been exposed to their ideas</span>
				<span class='text'>he possibility of influence by the so-called &quot;Rhineland mystics&quot; such as [[Meister Eckhart]], [[Johannes Tauler]], [[Henry Suso]] and [[John of Ruysbroeck]] has also been mooted by many authors</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;However, there is little precise agreement on which particular mystics may have been influential</span>
				<span class='text'>J</span>
				<span class='text'>Orcibal, ''S Jean de la Croix et les mystiques Rheno-Flamands'' (Desclee-Brouwer, Presence du Carmel, no</span>
				<span class='text'>6); Crisogono (1929), I, 17, believed that John was influenced more by German mysticism, than perhaps by [[Gregory of Nyssa]], [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite|Pseudo-Dionysius]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]], [[Bernard of Clairvaux|Saint Bernard]], the [[School of Saint Victor]] and the ''[[The Imitation of Christ|Imitation]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Others have seen Tauler alone as most influential</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Liz Carmichael, &quot;Appendix&quot;, in Norbert Cummins, ''Freedom to Rejoice: Understanding St John of the Cross'', (1991)</span>
				<span class='text'>Carmichael argues that John's three signs by which the &quot;night of sense&quot; may be recognised are derived from the &quot;Institutions&quot;, attributed in John's time to John Tauler, although actually a compendium of excerpts from various German writers of Tauler's time</span>
				<span class='text'>The Institutions was published in Latin in 1548, and Castilian in 1551</span>
				<span class='text'>Her hypothesis is that John must have had contact with this work at Salamanca, especially if he did indeed write a short thesis on contemplation while there</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Alongside the Rhineland mystics, others have argued for the influence of the Victorines and Bonaventure</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;A Benedictine of Stanbrook Abbey, ''Mediaeval Mystical Tradition and John of the Cross'',(London: Burns &amp; Oates, 1954) argues for the influence of (a) the Victorines (b) [[Bonaventure]] (c) the German and Flemish mystics</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Most recently, Peter Tyler has argued that John adopts a style of writing, a &quot;performative discourse&quot;, which works on both the reader's affect and intellect, in a tradition following a lineage from [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite|Pseudo-Dionysius]], the [[School of Saint Victor|Victorines]], [[Jean Gerson]] and through intermediaries such as [[Francisco de Osuna]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Peter Tyler, ''St John of the Cross'' (New York: Continuum, 2010)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;It is unclear, though, how John might have had access to the works of the Rhineland mystics</span>
				<span class='text'>These works were only translated into Latin in the second half of the sixteenth century</span>
				<span class='text'>This means that copies would hardly have been easily available for John</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, if it is acknowledged that an influence on John was [[Francisco de Osuna]] (who clearly cannot have read the Rhineland mystics since they were not known in Spain in the 1520s), then another problem is raised</span>
				<span class='text'>== Secular Spanish poetry ===However, a strong argument can also be made for contemporary Spanish literary influences on John</span>
				<span class='text'>This case was first made in detail by Dámaso Alonso,&lt;ref&gt;Dámaso Alonso, ''La poesía de San Juan de la Cruz'' (Madrid, 1942)&lt;/ref&gt; who believed that as well as drawing from scripture, John was transforming non-religious, profane themes, derived from popular songs (''romanceros'') into religious poetry; Alonso argued that John was particularly influenced by the works of the Spanish Renaissance poets [[Garcilaso de la Vega (poet)|Garcilaso de la Vega]] and [[Juan Boscán Almogáver|Boscán]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Certainly, John does appear to have used Garcilaso's verse forms in his own poetry, in particular in the ''Spiritual Canticle'', ''Dark Night'', and ''Living Flame of Love''</span>
				<span class='text'>Alongside the various biblical images noted above, for example, exist in John's poems many new Renaissance symbols of pastoral love, prominent in the poetry of Garcilaso and Boscán, such as sirens, nightingales, nymphs, doves and shepherds</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Tyler /&gt; Moreover, in the Prologue to the ''Living Flame'', John states that &quot;the composition of these lyric lines is like those that in Boscán are given a religious meaning&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Kavanaugh (1991)  also points out that these lines are in fact not by Boscán, but by Garcilaso, although the confusion was common at the time, as the works of the two poets had been published together</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Others, though, have questioned the evidence for precisely how John might have been influenced by Boscan and Garcilaso</span>
				<span class='text'>Dámaso Alonso argued that John must have read the newly published 1575 edition of the poets in [[Province of Ávila|Ávila]], shortly before his imprisonment in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], and that this must have been the key influence which rekindled in John memories of his own reading of Garcilaso as a young student of the Jesuits in [[Medina del Campo]]</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Peter Thompson disputes this, arguing it is not definite John would have been familiar with Garcilaso from an early age, and even so the influence has been overemphasised by other commentators</span>

				<span class='text'>117, Peter Thompson, ''St</span>
				<span class='text'>John of the Cross: Songs in the Night'' (London: SPCK, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;=== Islamic influence ===A controversial theory of the origins of John’s mystical imagery is that he was influenced by Islamic sources</span>
				<span class='text'>This was first proposed in detail by Miguel Asín Palacios and has been most recently put forward by the [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] scholar Luce Lopez Baralt</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Luce Lopez Baralt, ''Juan de la Cruz y el Islam'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; Arguing that John was influenced by Islamic sources on the peninsula, she traces Islamic antecedents of the images of the &quot;dark night&quot;, the &quot;solitary bird&quot; of the ''Spiritual Canticle'', wine and mystical intoxication (the ''Spiritual Canticle''), lamps of fire (the ''Living Flame'') and so on</span>
				<span class='text'>eter Tyler, though, puts forward a number of coherent objections to this line of enquiry</span>
				<span class='text'>Firstly, as he points out, these metaphors, while present in certain Islamic sources in other parts of the Muslim world, are not always prominent in the Andalucian and North African Islamic sources</span>
				<span class='text'>Secondly, in any case, John is using them in different ways from the Islamic sources</span>
				<span class='text'>Thirdly, and crucially, there seems to have been little cultural interplay between Islamic culture and Christian culture in Spain by the late sixteenth century, with sources existing in different languages, not being translated, and of course all Muslims already having been forced to leave Spain</span>
				<span class='text'>Rather, Tyler concludes, there &quot;are sufficient Christian medieval antecedents for many of the metaphors John employs to suggest we should look for Christian sources rather than Muslim sources&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>138-142&lt;/ref&gt; As José Nieto indicates, in trying to locate a link between Spanish Christian mysticism and Islamic mysticism, it might make more sense to refer to the common Neo-Platonic tradition and mystical experiences of both, rather than seek direct influence</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;José Nieto, ''Mystic, Rebel, Saint: A Study of St</span>
				<span class='text'>John of the Cross'' (Geneva, 1979)&lt;/ref&gt;=== Ahistorical theories ===Jean Baruzi claimed that the Spanish mystics created their decisive symbols independently of the historical conditions of the time</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jean Baruzi, ''Saint Jean de la Croix et la problème de l'experience mystique'', (Paris, 1924)&lt;/ref&gt; This theory, however, has not been widely pursued</span>
