				<span class='text'>gg|Swedish pronunciation}}: /ˈstrindˌbɜrj/; 22 January 1849 – 14 May 1912) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] playwright, novelist, poet, essayist and painter</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Lane 1998, 1040&quot;&gt;Lane (1998), 1040</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985), 3, 567</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams (1952), 75</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; A prolific writer who often drew directly on his personal experience, Strindberg's career spanned four decades, during which time he wrote over 60 plays and more than 30 works of fiction, autobiography, history, cultural analysis, and politics</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Williams (1952, 75)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; A bold experimenter and iconoclast throughout, he explored a wide range of dramatic methods and purposes, from naturalistic [[tragedy]], [[monodrama]], and history plays, to his anticipations of [[Expressionism (theatre)|expressionist]] and [[Surrealism|surrealist]] dramatic techniques</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lane (1998), 1040–41</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams (1952), 75–6, 100</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; From his earliest work, Strindberg developed innovative forms of dramatic action, language, and visual composition</span>
				<span class='text'> He is considered the &quot;father&quot; of modern [[Swedish literature]] and his ''[[The Red Room (Strindberg)|The Red Room]]'' (1879) has frequently been described as the first modern Swedish novel</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Adams (2002)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985), 79</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In Sweden Strindberg is known as an essayist, painter, poet, and especially as a novelist and playwright, but in other countries he is known mostly as a playwright</span>
				<span class='text'>he [[Royal Dramatic Theatre|Royal Theatre]] rejected his first major play, ''[[Master Olof]]'', in 1872; it was not until 1881, at the age of 32, that its première at the [[Swedish Theatre (Stockholm)|New Theatre]] gave him his theatrical breakthrough</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Lane 1998, 1040&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985), 49, 95</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In his plays ''[[The Father (Strindberg)|The Father]]'' (1887), ''[[Miss Julie]]'' (1888), and ''[[Creditors (play)|Creditors]]'' (1889), he created naturalistic dramas that – building on the established accomplishments of [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s prose [[problem plays]] while rejecting their use of the structure of the [[well-made play]] – responded to the call-to-arms of [[Émile Zola]]'s manifesto &quot;Naturalism in the Theatre&quot; (1881) and the example set by [[André Antoine]]'s newly established [[Théâtre Libre]] (opened 1887)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1993, 280), Innes (2000, 22), Lane (1998, 1040), and Williams (1952, 77–80)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In ''Miss Julie'', characterisation replaces plot as the predominant dramatic element (in contrast to [[melodrama]] and the well-made play) and the determining role of [[heredity]] and the [[Social environment|environment]] on the &quot;vacillating, disintegrated&quot; characters is emphasized</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Quoting from Strindberg's Preface to ''Miss Julie''; see Carlson (1993, 281), Innes (2000, 12–13), and Lane (1998, 1040)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Strindberg modelled his short-lived Scandinavian Experimental Theatre (1889) in [[Copenhagen]] on Antoine's theatre and he explored the theory of Naturalism in his essays &quot;On Psychic Murder&quot; (1887), &quot;On Modern Drama and the Modern Theatre&quot; (1889), and a preface to ''Miss Julie'', the last of which is probably the best-known statement of the principles of the theatrical movement</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1993, 280) and Lane (1998, 1040)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;During the 1890s he spent significant time abroad engaged in scientific experiments and studies of the occult</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=cgt0&gt;Lane (1998, 1040)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; A series of psychotic attacks between 1894 to 1896 (referred to as his &quot;Inferno crisis&quot;) led to his hospitalisation and return to Sweden</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=cgt0/&gt; Under the influence of the ideas of [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], he resolved after his recovery to become &quot;the Zola of the Occult&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lane (1998, 1040) and Meyer (1985, 350); on 23 August 1896 he wrote in a letter to Torsten Hedlund: &quot;You said recently that people are looking for the Zola of occultism</span>
				<span class='text'>That I feel is my vocation</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898 he returned to playwriting with ''[[To Damascus]]'', which, like ''[[The Great Highway]]'' (1909), is a dream-play of spiritual pilgrimage</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lane (1998, 1041), Meyer (1985, 374), and Williams (1952, 86–93)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; His ''[[A Dream Play]]'' (1902) – with its radical attempt to dramatise the workings of the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] by means of an abolition of conventional dramatic time and space and the splitting, doubling, merging, and multiplication of its characters – was an important precursor to both expressionism and surrealism</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1993, 346–347) and Lane (1998, 1041)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He also returned to writing historical drama, the genre with which he had begun his playwriting career</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lane (1998, 1041)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He helped to run the [[Strindbergs Intima Teater|Intimate Theatre]] from 1907, a small-scale theatre, modelled on [[Max Reinhardt]]'s Kammerspielhaus, that staged his [[chamber play]]s (such as ''[[The Ghost Sonata]]'')</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lane (1998, 1041) and Williams (1952, 96–99)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Biography=====Youth===[[File:Klara skola</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|200px|The school in [[Klara (Stockholm)|Klara, Stockholm]], whose harsh discipline haunted Strindberg in his adult life]]Strindberg was born on 22 January 1849 in Stockholm, Sweden, the third surviving son of Carl Oscar Strindberg ([[Shipping agency|a shipping agent]]) and Eleonora Ulrika Norling (a serving-maid)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 3–4)</span>
				<span class='text'>In his autobiographical novel, ''[[The Son of a Servant]]'' (1886), Strindberg described his father as &quot;an aristocrat by birth and upbringing&quot;; quoted by Meyer (1985, 8)</span>
				<span class='text'>When Johan August was four his father was declared bankrupt; see Meyer (1985, 7)</span>
				<span class='text'>He had two elder brothers, Carl Axel and Oscar, who were born before their parents were married</span>
				<span class='text'>After Johan August came another brother, Olle, and three sisters, Anna, Elisabeth, and Nora; see Meyer (1988, 3, 7)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In his autobiographical novel ''[[The Son of a Servant]]'', Strindberg describes a childhood affected by &quot;emotional insecurity, poverty, religious fanaticism and neglect</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster (1995, 1074–5)</span>
				<span class='text'>One of his biographers, [[Olof Lagercrantz]], warns against the use of ''[[The Son of a Servant]]'' as a biographical source</span>
				<span class='text'>Lagercrantz notes Strindberg's &quot;talent to make us believe what he wants us to believe&quot; and his unwillingness to accept any characterization of his person other than his own (1984)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; When he was seven, Strindberg moved to Norrtullsgatan on the northern, almost-rural periphery of the city</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 9–10)</span>
				<span class='text'>Norrtullsgatan is not far from [[Tegnérlunden]], the park where [[Carl Eldh]]'s grand statue of Strindberg was later placed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; A year later the family moved near to Sabbatsberg, where they stayed for three years before returning to Norrtullsgatan</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 11)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He attended a harsh school in Klara for four years, an experience that haunted him in his adult life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 10)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He was moved to the school in Jakob in 1860, which he found far more pleasant, though he remained there for only a year</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 11–13)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In the autumn of 1861, he was moved to the [[Stockholms Lyceum|Stockholm Lyceum]], a progressive private school for middle-class boys, where he remained for six years</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Meyer 1985, 13&quot;&gt;Meyer (1985, 13)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; As a child he had a keen interest in natural science, photography, and religion (following his mother's [[Pietism]])</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 12–13)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Strindberg recalled later with bitterness, always resented her son's intelligence</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Meyer 1985, 13&quot;/&gt; She died when he was thirteen, and although his grief lasted for only three months, in later life he came to feel a sense of loss and longing for an idealised maternal figure</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Meyer 1985, 15&quot;&gt;Meyer (1985, 13–15)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Less than a year after her death, his father married the children's [[governess]], Emilia Charlotta Pettersson</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 15)</span>
				<span class='text'>Together they had a son, Emil, who was born in the year after their marriage</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; According to his sisters, Strindberg came to regard them as his worst enemies</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Meyer 1985, 15&quot;/&gt; He passed his [[Studentexamen|graduation exam]] in May 1867 and enrolled at the [[Uppsala University]], where he began on 13 September</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 18–19)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Strindberg spent the next few years in [[Uppsala]] and Stockholm, alternately studying for exams and trying his hand at non-academic pursuits</span>
				<span class='text'>As a young student, Strindberg also worked as an assistant in a pharmacy in the university town of [[Lund]] in southern Sweden</span>
				<span class='text'>He supported himself in between studies as a substitute primary-school teacher and as a tutor for the children of two well-known physicians in Stockholm</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Adams_2002&gt;Adams (2002)&lt;!-- missing page numbers for citations --&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He first left Uppsala in 1868 to work as a schoolteacher, but then studied chemistry for some time at the [[Royal Institute of Technology|Institute of Technology]] in Stockholm in preparation for medical studies, later working as a private tutor before becoming an extra at the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre|Royal Theatre]] in Stockholm</span>
				<span class='text'>In May 1869, he failed his qualifying chemistry exam which in turn made him uninterested in schooling</span>
				<span class='text'>==1870s===Strindberg returned to [[Uppsala University]] in January 1870 to study aesthetics and modern languages and to work on a number of plays</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985), 30</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; It was at this time that he first learnt about the ideas of [[Charles Darwin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985), 30–2</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He co-founded the Rune Society, a small literary club whose members adopted pseudonyms taken from [[Runic alphabet|runes]] of the ancient [[Teutons|Teutonic]] alphabet – Strindberg called himself [[Freyr|Frö]] (Seed), after the god of fertility</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 31)</span>
				<span class='text'>The membership was restricted to a maximum of nine</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; After abandoning a draft of a play about [[Eric XIV of Sweden]] halfway through in the face of criticism from the Rune Society, on 30 March he completed a one-act comedy in verse called ''In Rome'' about [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]], which he had begun the previous autumn</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985), 31–2</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The play was accepted by the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre|Royal Theatre]], where it premièred on 13 September 1870</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985), 32</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Robinson 2009 xvii&quot;&gt;Robinson (2009), xvii</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; As he watched it performed, he realised that it was not good and felt like drowning himself, though the reviews published the following day were generally favourable</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 32–4)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; That year he also first read works of [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and [[Georg Brandes]], both of whom influenced him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;Robinson 2009 xvii&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985), 34–5</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;[[File:AStrindberg1874</span>
				<span class='text'>peg|thumb|left|200px|Portrait of Strindberg in 1874]]Taking his cue from [[William Shakespeare]], he began to use colloquial and realistic speech in his historical dramas, which challenged the convention that they should be written in stately verse</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} During the Christmas holiday of 1870–71, he re-wrote an historical tragedy, ''Sven the Sacrificer'', as a one-act play in prose called ''[[The Outlaw (play)|The Outlaw]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;Robinson 2009 xvii&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985), 37</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Depressed by Uppsala, he stayed in Stockholm, returning to the university in April to pass an exam in Latin and in June to defend his thesis on [[Adam Gottlob Oehlenschläger]]'s [[Romanticism|Romantic]] [[tragedy]] ''Earl Haakon'' (1802)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985), 38–9</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Following further revision in the summer, ''The Outlaw'' opened at the Royal Theatre on 16 October 1871</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;Robinson 2009 xvii&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985), 37, 40–1</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Outlaw'' was first published in December 1876; see Meyer (1985), 71</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Despite hostile reviews, the play earned him an audience with [[Charles XV of Sweden|King Charles XV]], who supported his studies with a payment of 200 [[Swedish riksdaler|riksdaler]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 41–3)</span>
				<span class='text'>After asking when he could expect the next payment in the spring of 1872, he was informed that it was not a regular arrangement, but was sent one further payment</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the year Strindberg completed a first draft of his first major work, a play about [[Olaus Petri]] called ''[[Master Olof]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;Robinson 2009 xvii&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985), 43</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In September 1872, the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre|Royal Theatre]] rejected it, leading to decades of rewrites, bitterness, and a contempt for official institutions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster (1995), 1074–5</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 49)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Returning to the university for what would be his final term in the spring, he left on 2&amp;nbsp;March 1872, without graduating</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 43–4)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In ''Town and Gown'' (1877), a collection of short stories describing student life, he ridiculed Uppsala and its professors</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lagercrantz (1984), 73</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985), 70</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson (2009, xviii)</span>
				<span class='text'>Meyer gives the collection's date of publication as December 1876, while Lagercrantz and Robinson give it as December 1877</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Strindberg embarked on his career as a journalist and critic for newspapers in Stockholm</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 44)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He was particularly excited at this time by [[Henry Thomas Buckle]]'s ''History of Civilization'' and the first volume of Georg Brandes' ''Main Currents of Nineteenth-Century Literature''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 46–7)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; From December 1874, Strindberg worked for eight years as an assistant librarian at the [[National Library of Sweden|Royal Library]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Lagercrantz 1984, 49&quot;&gt;Lagercrantz (1984), 49</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lagercrantz 1984, 49&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985), 53</span>
				<span class='text'>He was accepted for the position despite not possessing the requisite university degree; it is possible that two articles that had been published in ''The Swedish Citizen'' in March 1874, in which he praised the library and its chief librarian, may have prompted his acceptance</span>
				<span class='text'>After taking several periods of unpaid leave in 1881–82, he finally resigned from the library on 31 August 1882</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985), 92</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; That same month, Strindberg offered ''[[Master Olof]]'' to Edvard Stjernström (the director of the newly built [[Swedish Theatre (Stockholm)|New Theatre]] in Stockholm), but it was rejected</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Lagercrantz 1984, 49&quot;/&gt; He socialised with writers, painters, journalists, and other librarians; they often met in the Red Room in [[Berns Salonger|Bern's Restaurant]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;Robinson 2009 xvii&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985), 55–6</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Early in the summer of 1875, he met [[Siri von Essen]], a 24-year-old aspiring actress who, by virtue of her husband, was a [[baron]]ess – he became infatuated with her</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lagercrantz (1984), 54–58</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985), 57–60</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;All his life, Strindberg, while affecting to despise aristocrats, was unwillingly attracted by them</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Strindberg in different works gives both late May and June as the date of their first meeting</span>
				<span class='text'>Siri had performed as an amateur, but her husband did not want her to become a professional</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Strindberg described himself as a &quot;failed author&quot; at this time: &quot;I feel like a deaf-mute,&quot; he wrote, &quot;as I cannot speak and am not permitted to write; sometimes I stand in the middle of my room that seems like a prison cell, and then I want to scream so that walls and ceilings would fly apart, and I have so much to scream about, and therefore I remain silent</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lagercrantz (1984), 57</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; As a result of an argument in January 1876 concerning the inheritance of the family firm, Strindberg's relationship with his father was terminated (he did not attend his funeral in February 1883)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lagercrantz (1984, 60–61) and Meyer (1985, 63, 109)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning of 1876, Strindberg and Siri began to meet in secret</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lagercrantz (1984), 61–3</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 63)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Following a successful audition that December, Siri became an actress at the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre|Royal Theatre]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lagercrantz (1984), 71</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985), 70–2</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; They married a year later, on 30 December 1877;&lt;ref&gt;Lagercrantz (1984), 69–70</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 88)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In April he began work on ''The Swedish People'', a four-part cultural history of Sweden written as a series of depictions of ordinary people's lives from the 9th century onwards, which he undertook mainly for financial reasons and which absorbed him for the next year; Larsson provided illustrations</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; While there, to provide a lead role for his wife and as a reply to [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''[[A Doll's House]]'' (1879), he also wrote ''Sir Bengt's Wife'', which opened on 25 November 1882 at the New Theatre</span>

				<span class='text'>]In 1884 Strindberg wrote a collection of short stories, ''[[Getting Married (Strindberg)|Getting Married]]'', that presented women in an [[egalitarian]] light and for which he was tried for and acquitted of [[blasphemy]] in Sweden</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Meyer (129–141) and Robinson (2009, xx)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Two groups &quot;led by influential members of the upper classes, supported by the right-wing press&quot; probably instigated the prosecution; at the time, most people in Stockholm thought that [[Sophia of Nassau|Queen Sophia]] was behind it</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 135)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; By the end of that year Strindberg was in a despondent mood: &quot;My view now is,&quot; he wrote, &quot;everything is shit</span>

				<span class='text'>His next play, ''Comrades'' (1886), was his first in a contemporary setting</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Robinson (2009, xxi)</span>
				<span class='text'>The play's original title was ''Marauders''</span>
				<span class='text'>It received its première on 23 October 1905 at the Lustspieltheater in [[Vienna]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; After the trial he evaluated his religious beliefs, and concluded that he needed to leave [[Lutheranism]], though he had been Lutheran since childhood; and after briefly being a [[deist]], he became an [[atheist]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He needed a [[credo]] and he used [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] nature worshiping, which he had studied while a student, as one</span>
				<span class='text'>His works ''[[The People of Hemsö]]'' (1887) and ''Among French Peasants'' (1889) were influenced by his study of Rousseau</span>
				<span class='text'>He then moved to Germany, where he fell in love with [[Chancellor]] [[Otto von Bismarck]]'s [[Prussia]] status of the officer corps</span>
				<span class='text'>After that, he grew very critical of Rousseau and turned to [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s philosophies, which emphasized the male intellect</span>
				<span class='text'>Nietzsche's influence can be seen in ''The Defence of a Fool'' (1893), ''Pariah'' (1889), ''[[Creditors (play)|Creditors]]'' (1889), and ''By the Open Sea'' (1890)</span>
				<span class='text'>nother change in his life after the trial is that Strindberg decided he wanted a scientific life instead of a literary one, and began to write about non-literary subjects</span>
				<span class='text'>When he was 37, he began ''[[The Son of a Servant]]'', a four-part autobiography</span>
				<span class='text'>The first part ends in 1867, the year he left home for Uppsala</span>
				<span class='text'>Part two describes his youth up to 1872</span>
				<span class='text'>Part three, or ''The Red Room'', describes his years as a poet and journalist; it ends with his meeting [[Siri von Essen]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Part four, which dealt with the years from 1877 to 1886, was banned by his publishers and was not published until after his death</span>
				<span class='text'>The three missing years, 1875–1877, were the time when Strindberg was wooing von Essen and their marriage; entitled ''He and She'', this portion of his autobiography was not printed until 1919, after his death</span>
				<span class='text'>It contains the love letters between the two during that period</span>
				<span class='text'>n the later half of the 1880s Strindberg discovered [[Naturalism (theatre)|Naturalism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After completing ''[[The Father (Strindberg)|The Father]]'' in a matter of weeks, he sent a copy to [[Émile Zola]] for his approval, though Zola's reaction was lukewarm</span>
				<span class='text'>The drama revolves around the conflict between the Captain, a father, husband, and scientist, and his wife, Laura, over the education of their only child, a fourteen-year-old daughter named Berta</span>
				<span class='text'>Through unscrupulous means, Laura gets the Captain to doubt his fatherhood until he suffers a mental and physical collapse</span>
				<span class='text'>While writing ''The Father'', Strindberg himself was experiencing marital problems and doubted the paternity of his children</span>
				<span class='text'>He also suspected that Ibsen had based Hjalmar Ekdal in ''[[The Wild Duck]]'' (1884) on Strindberg because he felt that Ibsen viewed him as a weak and pathetic husband; he reworked the situation of Ibsen's play into a warfare between the two sexes</span>
				<span class='text'>From November 1887 to April 1889, Strindberg stayed in [[Copenhagen]]</span>
				<span class='text'>While there he had several opportunities to meet with both [[Georg Brandes]] and his brother [[Edvard Brandes]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Georg helped him put on ''The Father'', which had its première on 14 November 1887 at the Casino Theatre in Copenhagen</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 183) and Robinson (2009, xxi)</span>

				<span class='text'>Sacha Sjöström (left) as Kristin, Manda Björling as Miss Julie, and August Falck as Jean</span>
				<span class='text'>]Before writing ''[[Creditors (play)|Creditors]]'', Strindberg completed one of his most famous pieces, ''[[Miss Julie]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote the play with a Parisian stage in mind, in particular the [[Théâtre Libre]], founded in 1887 by [[Andre Antoine]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In the play he used [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[survival of the fittest]] and dramatized a doomed sexual encounter that crosses the division of social classes</span>
				<span class='text'>It is believed that this play was inspired by the marriage of Strindberg, the son of a servant, to an aristocratic woman</span>
				<span class='text'>n the essay ''On Psychic Murder'' (1887), he referred to the psychological theories of the [[Nancy School]], which advocated the use of hypnosis</span>
				<span class='text'>Strindberg developed a theory that sexual warfare was not motivated by carnal desire but by relentless human will</span>
				<span class='text'>The winner was the one who had the strongest and most unscrupulous mind, someone who, like a hypnotist, could coerce a more impressionable psyche into submission</span>
				<span class='text'>His view on psychological power struggles may be seen in works such as ''Creditors'' (1889), ''The Stronger'' (1889), and ''Pariah'' (1889)</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1888, after a separation and reconciliation with Siri von Essen, he founded the Scandinavian Experimental Theatre in Copenhagen, where Siri became manager</span>
				<span class='text'>He asked writers to send him scripts, which he received from [[Herman Bang]], [[Gustav Wied]] and Nathalia Larsen</span>
				<span class='text'>Less than a year later, with the theatre and reconciliation short lived, he moved back to Sweden while Siri moved back to her native Finland with the children</span>
				<span class='text'>While there, he rode out the final phase of the divorce and later used this agonizing ordeal for the basis of ''The Bond and the Link'' (1893)</span>
				<span class='text'>Strindberg also became interested in short drama, called Quart d'heure</span>
				<span class='text'>He was inspired by writers such as Gustave Guiche and Henri de Lavedan</span>
				<span class='text'>His notable contribution was ''[[The Stronger]]'' (1889)</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result of the failure of the Scandinavian Experimental Theatre, Strindberg did not work as a playwright for three years</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1889, he published an essay entitled &quot;On Modern Drama and the Modern Theatre&quot;, in which he disassociated himself from naturalism, arguing that it was petty and unimaginative realism</span>
				<span class='text'>His sympathy for Nietzsche's philosophy and atheism in general was also on the wane</span>
				<span class='text'>He entered the period of his &quot;Inferno crisis,&quot; in which he had psychological and religious upheavals that influenced his later works</span>
				<span class='text'>ugust Strindberg's Inferno is his personal account of sinking deeper into some kind of madness, typified by visions and paranoia</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''Strindberg och alkoholen'' (1985), James Spens discusses Strindberg's drinking habits, including his liking for absinthe and its possible implications for Strindberg's mental health during the inferno period</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|[[Edvard Munch]] ''Portrait of August Strindberg'', 1892, [[Moderna Museet|Museum of Modern Art]], [[Stockholm, Sweden]]]]After his disenchantment with naturalism, Strindberg had a growing interest in transcendental matters</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] was just beginning at this time</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Verner von Heidenstam]] and Ola Hanson had dismissed naturalism as &quot;shoemaker realism&quot; that rendered human experience in simplistic terms</span>
				<span class='text'>This is believed to have stalled Strindberg's creativity, and Strindberg insisted that he was in a rivalry and forced to defend naturalism, even though he had exhausted its literary potential</span>
				<span class='text'>These works include: ''Debit and Credit'' (1892), ''Facing Death'' (1892), ''Motherly Love'' (1892), and ''The First Warning'' (1893)</span>
				<span class='text'>His play ''The Keys of Heaven'' (1892) was inspired by the loss of his children in his divorce</span>
				<span class='text'>He also completed one of his few comedies, ''Playing with Fire'' (1893), and the first two parts of his post-inferno trilogy ''To Damascus'' (1898–1904)</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1892, he experienced writer's block, which led to a drastic reduction in his income</span>
				<span class='text'>Depression followed as he was unable to meet his financial obligations and to support his children and former wife</span>

				<span class='text'>His attention turned to [[Frida Uhl]], who was twenty-three years younger than Strindberg</span>
				<span class='text'>They were married in 1893</span>
				<span class='text'>Less than a year later, their daughter Kerstin was born and the couple separated, though their marriage was not officially dissolved until 1897</span>
				<span class='text'>Frida's family, in particular her mother, who was a devout Catholic, had an important influence on Strindberg, and in an 1894 letter he declared &quot;I feel the hand of our Lord resting over me</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;Some critics think that Strindberg suffered from severe paranoia in the mid-1890s, and perhaps that he temporarily experienced insanity</span>
				<span class='text'>Others, including Evert Sprinchorn and [[Olof Lagercrantz]], believed that he intentionally turned himself into his own guinea pig by doing psychological and drug-induced self-experimentation</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote on subjects such as [[botany]], [[chemistry]], and [[optics]] before returning to literature with the publication of his edited journals ''Legends'' and ''Jacob Wrestling'' (both 1898), where he noted the impact [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] had on his current work</span>

				<span class='text'>He said that &quot;the Powers&quot; were an outside force that had caused him his physical and mental suffering because they were acting in retribution to humankind for their wrongdoings</span>
				<span class='text'>As [[William Blake]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Honoré de Balzac]], and [[William Butler Yeats]] had been, he was drawn to [[Swedenborg]]'s mystical visions, with their depictions of spiritual landscape and Christian morality</span>
				<span class='text'>Strindberg believed for the rest of his life that the relationship between the transcendental and the real world was described by a series of &quot;correspondences&quot; and that everyday events were really messages from above of which only the enlightened could make sense</span>
				<span class='text'>He also felt that he was chosen by [[Divine Providence|Providence]] to atone for the moral decay of others and that his tribulations were payback for misdeeds earlier in his life</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1899, he returned to Sweden, following a successful production of ''Master Olaf'' in 1897 (which was re-staged in 1899 to mark Strindberg's fiftieth birthday)</span>
				<span class='text'>He had the desire to become the national poet and felt that historical dramas were the way to attain that status</span>
				<span class='text'>Though Strindberg claimed that he was writing &quot;realistically,&quot; he freely altered past events and biographical information, and telescoped chronology</span>
				<span class='text'>Works included the so-called Vasa Trilogy: ''The Saga of the Folkungs'' (1899), ''Gustavus Vasa'' (1899), and ''Erik XIV'' (1899)</span>

				<span class='text'>ugust Falck, an actor, wanted to put on a production of ''Miss Julie'' and wrote to him for permission</span>
				<span class='text'>In September 1906 he staged the first Swedish production of ''Miss Julie''</span>
				<span class='text'>August Palme, Strindberg's friend, played Jean and Manda Bjorling played Julie</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1909, Strindberg thought he might get the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], but instead lost to [[Selma Lagerlöf]], the first woman and first Swede to win the award</span>
				<span class='text'>The leader of the [[Social Democratic Youth of Denmark|Social Democrat Youth Alliance]] started a fund-raiser for a special award</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Nathan Söderblom]] was noted as a donor, yet he was criticized by the conservative party</span>
				<span class='text'>In total there was 45,000 Swedish crowns collected, by more than 20,000 donors, most of whom were workers</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Albert Bonniers förlag]] paid him 200,000 Swedish crowns for his complete works</span>
				<span class='text'>He invited his first three children to Stockholm and divided the money into five shares, one for each child, one for Siri, and the other for himself</span>
				<span class='text'>e founded [[Strindbergs Intima Teater|The Intimate Theatre]] in Stockholm in 1907</span>
				<span class='text'>His theatre was modeled after Max Reinhart's Kammerspiel Haus</span>
				<span class='text'>Strindberg had the intention of the theatre being used for his plays and his plays only, he also had the intention of the theatre being used mainly to perform chamber plays</span>
				<span class='text'>For the theater's opening, Strindberg wrote four chamber plays: ''Thunder in the Air, The Burned Site, The Ghost Sonata'', and ''The Pelican''</span>
				<span class='text'>Strindberg had very specific ideas about how the theatre would be opened and operated</span>
				<span class='text'>He drafted a series of rules for his theatre in a letter to August Falck: 1</span>
				<span class='text'>No liquor</span>
				<span class='text'>2</span>
				<span class='text'>No Sunday performances</span>
				<span class='text'>3</span>
				<span class='text'>Short performances without intermissions</span>
				<span class='text'>4</span>
				<span class='text'>No calls</span>
				<span class='text'>5</span>
				<span class='text'>Only 160 seats in the auditorium</span>
				<span class='text'>6</span>
				<span class='text'>No prompter</span>
				<span class='text'>No orchestra, only music on stage</span>
				<span class='text'>7</span>
				<span class='text'>The text will be sold at the box office and in the lobby</span>
				<span class='text'>8</span>
				<span class='text'>Summer performances</span>
				<span class='text'>Falck helped to design the auditorium, which was decorated in a deep-green tone</span>
				<span class='text'>The ceiling lighting was a yellow silk cover which created an effect of mild daylight</span>
				<span class='text'>The floor was covered with a deep-green carpet, and the auditorium was decorated by six ultra modern columns with elaborate up-to-date capitals</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead of the usual restaurant Strindberg offered a lounge for the ladies and a smoking-room for the gentlemen</span>
				<span class='text'>The stage was unusually small, only 6 by 9 metres</span>
				<span class='text'>The small stage and minimal amount of seats was meant to give the audience a greater feeling of involvement in the work</span>
				<span class='text'>Unlike most theatres at this time, the Intima Teater was not a place in which people could come to socialize</span>
				<span class='text'>By setting up his rules and creating an intimate atmosphere, Strindberg was able to demand the audience's focus</span>
				<span class='text'>When the theatre opened in 1907 with a performance of ''The Pelican'' it was a rather large hit</span>
				<span class='text'>Strindberg used a minimal technique, as was his way, by only having a back drop and some sea shells on the stage for scene design and props</span>
				<span class='text'>Strindberg was much more concerned with the actors portraying the written word than the stage looking pretty</span>
				<span class='text'>The theatre ran into a financial difficulty in February 1908 and Falck had to borrow money from [[Prince Eugén, Duke of Närke]], who attended the première of ''The Pelican''</span>
				<span class='text'>The theatre eventually went bankrupt in 1910, but did not close until Strindberg's death in 1912</span>
				<span class='text'>The newspapers wrote about the theatre until its death; however, Strindberg felt it was entirely unsuccessful</span>
				<span class='text'>He felt that he never had the opportunity to successfully stage a play the way he wanted to – which was the purpose of the theatre in the first place</span>
				<span class='text'>==Later life and death===[[File:Strindberg 2</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|Strindberg in his later years]]Strindberg died shortly after the first of his plays was staged in the United States—''[[The Father (Strindberg)|The Father]]'' opened on 9 April 1912 at the Berkeley Theatre in New York, in a translation by Edith and Wärner Oland</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;During Christmas 1911, Strindberg became sick with [[pneumonia]] and he never recovered completely</span>
				<span class='text'>He also started to suffer from a stomach cancer</span>
				<span class='text'>He died on 14 May 1912 at the age of 63</span>

				<span class='text'>His novel ''[[The Red Room (Strindberg)|The Red Room]]'' (1879) made him famous</span>
				<span class='text'>His early plays belong to the [[Naturalism (theatre)|Naturalistic]] movement</span>
				<span class='text'>His works from this time are often compared with the Norwegian playwright [[Henrik Ibsen]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Strindberg's best-known play from this period is ''[[Miss Julie]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Among his most widely read works is the novel ''[[The People of Hemsö]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Strindbergmetro</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|200px|Detail of mural in honour of August Strindberg in Stockholm, at the [[Rådmansgatan]] subway station]]Strindberg wanted to attain what he called &quot;greater Naturalism</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He disliked the expository character backgrounds that characterise the work of [[Henrik Ibsen]] and rejected the convention of a dramatic &quot;[[slice of life]]&quot; because he felt that the resulting plays were mundane and uninteresting</span>
				<span class='text'>Strindberg felt that true naturalism was a psychological &quot;battle of brains&quot;: two people who hate each other in the immediate moment and strive to drive the other to doom is the type of mental hostility that Strindberg strove to describe</span>
				<span class='text'>He intended his plays to be impartial and objective, citing a desire to make literature akin to a science</span>
				<span class='text'>ollowing the inner turmoil that he experienced during the &quot;Inferno crisis,&quot; he wrote an important book in French, ''[[Inferno (Strindberg)|Inferno]]'' (1896–7) in which he dramatised his experiences</span>
				<span class='text'>He also exchanged a few cryptic letters with [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]</span>
				<span class='text'>trindberg subsequently ended his association with Naturalism and began to produce works informed by [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He is considered one of the pioneers of the modern European stage and [[Expressionism (theatre)|Expressionism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[The Dance of Death (Strindberg)|The Dance of Death]]'', ''[[A Dream Play]]'', and ''[[The Ghost Sonata]]'' are well-known plays from this period</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|250px|right|[[Carl Eldh]]'s grand statue of Strindberg in [[Tegnérlunden]], Stockholm]]The history of the [[Paris Commune]], during 1871, caused young Strindberg to develop the opinion that politics is a conflict between the upper and lower classes</span>

				<span class='text'>Strindberg's political opinions nevertheless changed considerably within this category over the years, and he was never primarily a political writer</span>
				<span class='text'>Nor did he often campaign for any one issue, preferring instead to scorn his enemies manifesto-style – the military, the [[Church of Sweden|church]], the [[Monarchy of Sweden|monarchy]], the politicians, the stingy publishers, the incompetent reviewers, the narrow-minded, the idiots – and he was not loyal to any party or ideology</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of his works, however, had at least some politics and sometimes an abundance of it</span>
				<span class='text'>They often displayed the conviction that life and the prevailing system were profoundly unjust and injurious to ordinary citizens</span>
				<span class='text'>he changing nature of his political positions shows in his changing stance on the women's rights issue</span>
				<span class='text'>Early on, Strindberg was sympathetic to women of 19th-century Sweden, calling for women's suffrage as early as 1884</span>
				<span class='text'>However, during other periods he had wildly misogynistic opinions, calling for lawmakers to reconsider the emancipation of these &quot;half-apes </span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>criminal, instinctively evil animals</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> ''Det nya riket''), particularly during the early 1880s</span>
				<span class='text'>Strindberg's antisemitic pronouncements, just like his opinions of women, have been debated, and also seem to have varied considerably</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of these attitudes, passions and behaviours may have been developed for literary reasons and ended as soon as he had exploited them in books</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In satirizing Swedish society – in particular the upper classes, the cultural and political establishment, and his many personal and professional foes – he could be very confrontational, with scarcely concealed caricatures of political opponents</span>
