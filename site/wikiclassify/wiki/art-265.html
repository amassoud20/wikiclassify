				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=LS205&gt;Stephen DNB p</span>
				<span class='text'>205&lt;/ref&gt;Swift's family had several interesting literary connections: his grandmother, Elizabeth (Dryden) Swift, was the niece of [[Sir Erasmus Dryden, 1st Baronet|Sir Erasmus Dryden]], grandfather of the poet [[John Dryden]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The same grandmother's aunt, Katherine (Throckmorton) Dryden, was a first cousin of [[Elizabeth Raleigh|Elizabeth]], wife of Sir [[Walter Raleigh]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His great-great grandmother, Margaret (Godwin) Swift, was the sister of [[Francis Godwin]], author of ''[[The Man in the Moone]]'' which influenced parts of Swift's ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>His uncle, Thomas Swift, married a daughter of the poet and playwright Sir [[William Davenant]], a godson of [[William Shakespeare]]</span>
				<span class='text'>wift's uncle Godwin Swift (1628–1695), a benefactor, took primary responsibility for the young Jonathan, sending him with one of his cousins to [[Kilkenny College]] (also attended by the philosopher [[George Berkeley]])</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=LS205 /&gt; In 1682, financed by Godwin's son Willoughby, he attended Dublin University ([[Trinity College, Dublin]]), from which he received his B</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>in 1686, and developed his friendship with [[William Congreve]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Swift was studying for his master's degree when political troubles in Ireland surrounding the [[Glorious Revolution]] forced him in 1688 to leave for England, where his mother helped him get a position as secretary and personal assistant of [[William Temple (British politician)|Sir William Temple]] at [[Moor Park, Farnham]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Stephen DNB p</span>
				<span class='text'>206&lt;/ref&gt; Temple was an English diplomat who, having arranged the [[Triple Alliance of 1668]], had retired from public service to his country estate to tend his gardens and write his memoirs</span>
				<span class='text'>Gaining his employer's confidence, Swift &quot;was often trusted with matters of great importance&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=LS207&gt;Stephen DNB p</span>
				<span class='text'>207&lt;/ref&gt; Within three years of their acquaintance, Temple had introduced his secretary to [[William III of England|William&amp;nbsp;III]] and sent him to London to urge the King to consent to a bill for triennial Parliaments</span>
				<span class='text'>hen Swift took up his residence at Moor Park, he met [[Esther Johnson]], then eight years old, the daughter of an impoverished widow who acted as companion to Temple's sister, Lady Giffard</span>
				<span class='text'>Swift acted as her tutor and mentor, giving her the nickname &quot;Stella&quot;, and the two maintained a close but ambiguous relationship for the rest of Esther's life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=LS208&gt;Stephen DNB p</span>
				<span class='text'>208&lt;/ref&gt;In 1690, Swift left Temple for Ireland because of his health but returned to Moor Park the following year</span>
				<span class='text'>The illness, fits of vertigo or giddiness – now known to be [[Ménière's disease]]—would continue to plague Swift throughout his life</span>
				<span class='text'>During this second stay with Temple, Swift received his M</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>from [[Hertford College, Oxford|Hart Hall]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] in 1692</span>
				<span class='text'>Then, apparently despairing of gaining a better position through Temple's patronage, Swift left Moor Park to become an ordained priest in the Established [[Church of Ireland]], and in 1694 he was appointed to the [[prebendary|prebend]] of Kilroot in the [[Diocese of Connor (Church of Ireland)|Diocese of Connor]], with his parish located at [[Kilroot]], near [[Carrickfergus]] in [[County Antrim]]</span>
				<span class='text'>wift appears to have been miserable in his new position, being isolated in a small, remote community far from the centres of power and influence</span>
				<span class='text'>While at Kilroot, however, Swift may well have become romantically involved with Jane Waring, whom he called &quot;Varina&quot;, the sister of an old college friend</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=LS207 /&gt; A letter from him survives, offering to remain if she would marry him and promising to leave and never return to Ireland if she refused</span>
				<span class='text'>She presumably refused, because Swift left his post and returned to England and Temple's service at Moor Park in 1696, and he remained there until Temple's death</span>
				<span class='text'>There he was employed in helping to prepare Temple's memoirs and correspondence for publication</span>
				<span class='text'>During this time Swift wrote ''[[The Battle of the Books]]'', a satire responding to critics of Temple's ''Essay upon Ancient and Modern Learning'' (1690), though ''Battle'' was not published until 1704</span>
				<span class='text'>emple died on 27 January 1699</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=LS207 /&gt; Swift, normally a harsh judge of human nature, said that all that was good and amiable in humankind had died with Temple</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=LS207 /&gt; Swift stayed on briefly in England to complete the editing of Temple's memoirs, and perhaps in the hope that recognition of his work might earn him a suitable position in England</span>
				<span class='text'>Unfortunately, Swift's work made enemies among some of Temple's family and friends, in particular Temple's formidable sister, Lady Giffard, who objected to indiscretions included in the memoirs</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=LS208 /&gt; Swift's next move was to approach King William directly, based on his imagined connection through Temple and a belief that he had been promised a position</span>
				<span class='text'>This failed so miserably that he accepted the lesser post of secretary and chaplain to the [[Baron Berkeley|Earl of Berkeley]], one of the Lords Justice of Ireland</span>
				<span class='text'>However, when he reached Ireland he found that the secretaryship had already been given to another</span>
				<span class='text'>He soon obtained the living of Laracor, [[Agher]], and Rathbeggan, and the prebend of Dunlavin in St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Stephen DNB p</span>
				<span class='text'>209&lt;/ref&gt;At Laracor, just over four and half miles (7</span>
				<span class='text'>&amp;nbsp;km) from [[Summerhill, County Meath]], and twenty miles (32&amp;nbsp;km) from Dublin, Swift ministered to a congregation of about fifteen and had abundant leisure for cultivating his garden, making a canal (after the Dutch fashion of Moor Park), planting willows, and rebuilding the vicarage</span>
				<span class='text'>As chaplain to Lord Berkeley, he spent much of his time in Dublin and travelled to London frequently over the next ten years</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1701, Swift anonymously published a political pamphlet, ''A Discourse on the Contests and Dissentions in Athens and Rome''</span>
				<span class='text'>==Writer===In February 1702, Swift received his [[Doctor of Divinity]] degree from [[Trinity College, Dublin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>That spring he travelled to England and then returned to Ireland in October, accompanied by Esther Johnson—now 20—and his friend Rebecca Dingley, another member of William Temple's household</span>
				<span class='text'>There is a great mystery and controversy over Swift's relationship with Esther Johnson, nicknamed &quot;Stella&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Many, notably his close friend [[Thomas Sheridan (divine)|Thomas Sheridan]], believed that they were secretly married in 1716; others, like Swift's housekeeper Mrs Brent and Rebecca Dingley (who lived with Stella all through her years in Ireland) dismissed the story as absurd</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Stephen DNB pp</span>
				<span class='text'>215–217&lt;/ref&gt; Swift certainly did not wish her to marry anyone else: in 1704, when their mutual friend [[William Tisdall (cleric)|William Tisdall]]  informed Swift that he intended to propose to Stella, Swift wrote to him to dissuade him from the idea</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the tone of the letter was courteous, Swift privately expressed his disgust for Tisdall as an &quot;interloper&quot;, and they were estranged for many years</span>
				<span class='text'>uring his visits to England in these years, Swift published ''[[A Tale of a Tub]]'' and ''[[The Battle of the Books]]'' (1704) and began to gain a reputation as a writer</span>
				<span class='text'>This led to close, lifelong friendships with [[Alexander Pope]], [[John Gay]], and [[John Arbuthnot]], forming the core of the Martinus [[Scriblerus Club]] (founded in 1713)</span>
				<span class='text'>wift became increasingly active politically in these years</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Stephen DNB p</span>
				<span class='text'>212</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; From 1707 to 1709 and again in 1710, Swift was in London unsuccessfully urging upon the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] administration of [[Lord Godolphin]] the claims of the Irish clergy to the [[Queen Anne's Bounty|First-Fruits and Twentieths]] (&quot;Queen Anne's Bounty&quot;), which brought in about £2,500 a year, already granted to their brethren in England</span>
				<span class='text'>He found the opposition [[Tory (British political party)|Tory]] leadership more sympathetic to his cause, and, when they came to power in 1710, he was recruited to support their cause as editor of ''[[The Examiner (1710–1714)|The Examiner]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1711, Swift published the political pamphlet ''[[The Conduct of the Allies]]'', attacking the Whig government for its inability to end the prolonged war with France</span>
				<span class='text'>The incoming Tory government conducted secret (and illegal) negotiations with France, resulting in the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] (1713) ending the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]</span>
				<span class='text'>wift was part of the inner circle of the Tory government,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen DNB pp</span>
				<span class='text'>212–215&lt;/ref&gt; and often acted as mediator between [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Henry St John]] (Viscount Bolingbroke), the secretary of state for foreign affairs (1710–15), and [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer|Robert Harley]] (Earl of Oxford), lord treasurer and prime minister (1711–1714)</span>
				<span class='text'>Swift recorded his experiences and thoughts during this difficult time in a long series of letters to Esther Johnson, collected and published after his death as ''[[A Journal to Stella]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The animosity between the two Tory leaders eventually led to the dismissal of Harley in 1714</span>
				<span class='text'>With the death of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] and accession of [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] that year, the Whigs returned to power, and the Tory leaders were tried for treason for conducting secret negotiations with France</span>
				<span class='text'>lso during these years in London, Swift became acquainted with the Vanhomrigh family (Dutch merchants who had settled in Ireland, then moved to London) and became involved with one of the daughters, [[Esther Vanhomrigh|Esther]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Swift furnished Esther with the nickname &quot;Vanessa&quot;, and she features as one of the main characters in his poem ''[[Cadenus and Vanessa]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The poem and their correspondence suggest that Esther was infatuated with Swift, and that he may have reciprocated her affections, only to regret this and then try to break off the relationship</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Stephen DNB pp</span>
				<span class='text'>215–216&lt;/ref&gt; Esther followed Swift to Ireland in 1714, and settled at her old family home, [[Celbridge Abbey]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Their uneasy relationship continued for some years; then there appears to have been a confrontation, possibly involving Esther Johnson</span>
				<span class='text'>Esther Vanhomrigh died in 1723 at the age of 35, having destroyed the will she had made in Swift's favour</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Stephen DNB p</span>
				<span class='text'>216&lt;/ref&gt; Another lady with whom he had a close but less intense relationship was [[Anne Long]], a toast of the [[Kit-Cat Club]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==Maturity===[[File:St</span>
				<span class='text'>Patrick's Cathedral Swift bust</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|[[Bust (sculpture)|Bust]] in [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St Patrick's Cathedral]]]]Before the fall of the Tory government, Swift hoped that his services would be rewarded with a church appointment in England</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Queen Anne appeared to have taken a dislike to Swift and thwarted these efforts</span>
				<span class='text'>Her dislike has been attributed to ''The Tale of a Tub'', which she thought blasphemous, compounded by ''The Windsor Prophecy'', where Swift, with a surprising lack of tact, advised the Queen on which of her bedchamber ladies she should and which she should not trust</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gregg, Edward</span>
				<span class='text'>''Queen Anne'', Yale University Press 1980 pp</span>
				<span class='text'>352–353&lt;/ref&gt; The best position his friends could secure for him was the [[Dean of St</span>
				<span class='text'>Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|Deanery of St Patrick's]]; this was not in the Queen's gift and Anne, who could be a bitter enemy, made it clear that Swift would not have received the preferment if she could have prevented it</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gregg p</span>
				<span class='text'>353&lt;/ref&gt; With the return of the Whigs, Swift's best move was to leave England and he returned to Ireland in disappointment, a virtual exile, to live &quot;like a rat in a hole&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Stephen DNB p</span>
				<span class='text'>215&lt;/ref&gt;Once in Ireland, however, Swift began to turn his pamphleteering skills in support of Irish causes, producing some of his most memorable works: ''Proposal for Universal Use of Irish Manufacture'' (1720), ''Drapier's Letters'' (1724), and ''A Modest Proposal'' (1729), earning him the status of an Irish patriot</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Stephen DNB pp</span>
				<span class='text'>217–218&lt;/ref&gt; This new role was unwelcome to the Government, which made clumsy attempts to silence him</span>
				<span class='text'>His printer, Edward Waters, was convicted of [[seditious libel]] in 1720, but four years later a [[grand jury]] refused to find that the [[Drapier's Letters]] (which, though written under a pseudonym, were universally known to be Swift's work) were seditious</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Sir [[Walter Scott]]</span>
				<span class='text'>''Life of Jonathan Swift'', vol</span>
				<span class='text'>1, Edinburgh 1814, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>281–282&lt;/ref&gt; Swift responded with an attack on the Irish judiciary almost unparalleled in its ferocity, his principal target being the &quot;vile and profligate villain&quot; [[William Whitshed]], [[Lord Chief Justice of Ireland]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ball, F</span>
				<span class='text'>Elrington</span>
				<span class='text'>''The Judges in Ireland 1221–1921'', London John Murray 1926, vol</span>
				<span class='text'>2 pp</span>
				<span class='text'>103–105&lt;/ref&gt;Also during these years, he began writing his masterpiece, ''Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World, in Four Parts, by Lemuel Gulliver, first a surgeon, and then a captain of several ships'', better known as ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Much of the material reflects his political experiences of the preceding decade</span>
				<span class='text'>For instance, the episode in which the giant Gulliver puts out the Lilliputian palace fire by urinating on it can be seen as a metaphor for the Tories' illegal peace treaty; having done a good thing in an unfortunate manner</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1726 he paid a long-deferred visit to London,&lt;ref name=LS219&gt;Stephen DNB p</span>
				<span class='text'>219&lt;/ref&gt; taking with him the manuscript of ''Gulliver's Travels''</span>
				<span class='text'>During his visit he stayed with his old friends [[Alexander Pope]], [[John Arbuthnot]] and [[John Gay]], who helped him arrange for the anonymous publication of his book</span>
				<span class='text'>First published in November 1726, it was an immediate hit, with a total of three printings that year and another in early 1727</span>
				<span class='text'>French, German, and Dutch translations appeared in 1727, and pirated copies were printed in Ireland</span>
				<span class='text'>wift returned to England one more time in 1727 and stayed with Alexander Pope once again</span>
				<span class='text'>The visit was cut short when Swift received word that Esther Johnson was dying, and rushed back home to be with her</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=LS219 /&gt; On 28 January 1728, Esther Johnson died; Swift had prayed at her bedside, even composing prayers for her comfort</span>
				<span class='text'>Swift could not bear to be present at the end, but on the night of her death he began to write his ''The Death of Mrs Johnson''</span>
				<span class='text'>He was too ill to attend the funeral at St Patrick's</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=LS219 /&gt; Many years later, a lock of hair, assumed to be Esther Johnson's, was found in his desk, wrapped in a paper bearing the words, &quot;Only a woman's hair&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Swiftdeathmask</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|upright|Swift's [[death mask]]]]Death became a frequent feature of Swift's life from this point</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1731 he wrote ''Verses on the Death of Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Swift'', his own obituary published in 1739</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1732, his good friend and collaborator [[John Gay]] died</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1735, John Arbuthnot, another friend from his days in London, died</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1738 Swift began to show signs of illness, and in 1742 he may have suffered a stroke, losing the ability to speak and realising his worst fears of becoming mentally disabled</span>
				<span class='text'>(&quot;I shall be like that tree,&quot; he once said, &quot;I shall die at the top</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;)&lt;ref&gt;Stephen DNB p</span>
				<span class='text'>221&lt;/ref&gt; He became increasingly quarrelsome, and long-standing friendships, like that with Thomas Sheridan, ended without sufficient cause</span>
				<span class='text'>To protect him from unscrupulous hangers on, who had begun to prey on the great man, his closest companions had him declared of &quot;unsound mind and memory&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>However, it was long believed by many that Swift was actually insane at this point</span>
				<span class='text'>In his book ''[[Literature and Western Man]]'', author [[J</span>
				<span class='text'>B</span>
				<span class='text'>Priestley]] even cites the final chapters of ''Gulliver's Travels'' as proof of Swift's approaching &quot;insanity&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>n part VIII of his series, ''[[The Story of Civilization]]'', [[Will Durant]] describes the final years of Swift's life as such:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Definite symptoms of madness appeared in 1738</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1741 guardians were appointed to take care of his affairs and watch lest in his outbursts of violence he should do himself harm</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1742 he suffered great pain from the inflammation of his left eye, which swelled to the size of an egg; five attendants had to restrain him from tearing out his eye</span>
				<span class='text'>He went a whole year without uttering a word</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> 362</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In 1744, Alexander Pope died</span>
				<span class='text'>Then on 19 October 1745, Swift, at nearly 80, died</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=LS222&gt;Stephen DNB p</span>
				<span class='text'>222&lt;/ref&gt; After being laid out in public view for the people of Dublin to pay their last respects, he was buried in his own cathedral by Esther Johnson's side, in accordance with his wishes</span>
				<span class='text'>The bulk of his fortune (£12,000) was left to found a hospital for the mentally ill, originally known as St Patrick’s Hospital for Imbeciles, which opened in 1757, and which [[St</span>
				<span class='text'>Patrick's Hospital|still exists]] as a psychiatric hospital</span>

				<span class='text'>=Works=={{wikisource-author}}Swift was a prolific writer, notable for his satires</span>
				<span class='text'>The most recent collection of his prose works (Herbert Davis, ed</span>
				<span class='text'>Basil Blackwell, 1965–) comprises fourteen volumes</span>
				<span class='text'>A recent edition of his complete poetry (Pat Rodges, ed</span>
				<span class='text'>Penguin, 1983) is 953 pages long</span>
				<span class='text'>One edition of his correspondence (David Woolley, ed</span>

				<span class='text'>The [[Horace|Horatian]] motto reads, ''{{Lang|la|Exegi Monumentum Ære perennius}}'', &quot;I have completed a monument more lasting than brass</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The 'brass' is a pun, for Wood's [[Halfpenny (British sterling/pre-decimal coin)|half-pence]] (alloyed with brass) is scattered at his feet</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Cherub]]im award Swift a poet's laurel</span>
				<span class='text'>]Swift's first major prose work, ''[[A Tale of a Tub]]'', demonstrates many of the themes and stylistic techniques he would employ in his later work</span>
				<span class='text'>It is at once wildly playful and funny while being pointed and harshly critical of its targets</span>
				<span class='text'>In its main thread, the ''Tale'' recounts the exploits of three sons, representing the main threads of Christianity, who receive a bequest from their father of a coat each, with the added instructions to make no alterations whatsoever</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the sons soon find that their coats have fallen out of current fashion, and begin to look for loopholes in their father's will that will let them make the needed alterations</span>
				<span class='text'>As each finds his own means of getting around their father's admonition, they struggle with each other for power and dominance</span>
				<span class='text'>Inserted into this story, in alternating chapters, the narrator includes a series of whimsical &quot;digressions&quot; on various subjects</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1690, Sir [[Sir William Temple, 1st Baronet|William Temple]], Swift's patron, published ''An Essay upon Ancient and Modern Learning'' a defence of classical writing (see [[Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns]]), holding up the ''Epistles of Phalaris'' as an example</span>
				<span class='text'>[[William Wotton]] responded to Temple with ''Reflections upon Ancient and Modern Learning'' (1694), showing that the ''Epistles'' were a later forgery</span>
				<span class='text'>A response by the supporters of the Ancients was then made by [[Charles Boyle, 4th Earl of Orrery|Charles Boyle]] (later the 4th Earl of Orrery and father of Swift's first biographer)</span>
				<span class='text'>A further retort on the Modern side came from [[Richard Bentley]], one of the pre-eminent scholars of the day, in his essay ''Dissertation upon the Epistles of Phalaris'' (1699)</span>
				<span class='text'>The final words on the topic belong to Swift in his ''[[Battle of the Books]]'' (1697, published 1704) in which he makes a humorous defence on behalf of Temple and the cause of the Ancients</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1708, a cobbler named [[John Partridge (astrologer)|John Partridge]] published a popular [[almanac]] of [[astrological]] predictions</span>
				<span class='text'>Because Partridge falsely determined the deaths of several church officials, Swift attacked Partridge in ''Predictions for the Ensuing Year'' by [[Isaac Bickerstaff]], a parody predicting that Partridge would die on 29 March</span>
				<span class='text'>Swift followed up with a pamphlet issued on 30 March claiming that Partridge had in fact died, which was widely believed despite Partridge's statements to the contrary</span>
				<span class='text'>According to other sources,{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Richard Steele uses the personae of Isaac Bickerstaff and was the one who wrote about the &quot;death&quot; of John Partridge and published it in ''The Spectator,'' not Jonathan Swift</span>
				<span class='text'>'Drapier's Letters'' (1724) was a series of pamphlets against the monopoly granted by the English government to [[William Wood (Mintmaster)|William Wood]] to provide the Irish with copper coinage</span>
				<span class='text'>It was widely believed that Wood would need to flood Ireland with debased coinage in order make a profit</span>
				<span class='text'>In these &quot;letters&quot; Swift posed as a shop-keeper—a draper—to criticise the plan</span>
				<span class='text'>Swift's writing was so effective in undermining opinion in the project that a reward was offered by the government to anyone disclosing the true identity of the author</span>
				<span class='text'>Though hardly a secret (on returning to Dublin after one of his trips to England, Swift was greeted with a banner, &quot;Welcome Home, Drapier&quot;) no one turned Swift in, although there was an unsuccessful attempt to prosecute the publisher Harding</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Elrington Ball</span>
				<span class='text'>''The Judges in Ireland'', vol</span>
				<span class='text'>2 pp</span>
				<span class='text'>103–105&lt;/ref&gt; The government eventually resorted to hiring none other than Sir [[Isaac Newton]] to certify the soundness of Wood's coinage to counter Swift's accusations</span>
				<span class='text'>In &quot;Verses on the Death of Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Swift&quot; (1739) Swift recalled this as one of his best achievements</span>
				<span class='text'>'[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', a large portion of which Swift wrote at Woodbrook House in County Laois, was published in 1726</span>
				<span class='text'>It is regarded as his masterpiece</span>
				<span class='text'>As with his other writings, the ''Travels'' was published under a pseudonym, the fictional Lemuel Gulliver, a ship's surgeon and later a sea captain</span>
				<span class='text'>Some of the correspondence between printer Benj</span>
				<span class='text'>Motte and Gulliver's also-fictional cousin negotiating the book's publication has survived</span>
				<span class='text'>Though it has often been mistakenly thought of and published in [[bowdlerised]] form as a children's book, it is a great and sophisticated satire of human nature based on Swift's experience of his times</span>
				<span class='text'>''Gulliver's Travels'' is an anatomy of human nature, a sardonic looking-glass, often criticised for its apparent misanthropy</span>
				<span class='text'>It asks its readers to refute it, to deny that it has adequately characterised human nature and society</span>
				<span class='text'>Each of the four books—recounting four voyages to mostly fictional exotic lands—has a different theme, but all are attempts to deflate human pride</span>
				<span class='text'>Critics hail the work as a satiric reflection on the shortcomings of Enlightenment thought</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1729, Swift published ''[[A Modest Proposal|A Modest Proposal for Preventing the Children of Poor People in Ireland Being a Burden on Their Parents or Country, and for Making Them Beneficial to the Publick]]'', a satire in which the narrator, with intentionally grotesque arguments, recommends that Ireland's poor escape their poverty by selling their children as food to the rich: &quot;I have been assured by a very knowing American of my acquaintance in London, that a young healthy child well nursed is at a year old a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Following the satirical form, he introduces the reforms he is actually suggesting by deriding them:&lt;blockquote&gt;Therefore let no man talk to me of other expedients</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>axing our absentees</span>
				<span class='text'></span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>eaching landlords to have at least one degree of mercy towards their tenants</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Therefore I repeat, let no man talk to me of these and the like expedients, 'till he hath at least some glympse of hope, that there will ever be some hearty and sincere attempt to put them into practice</span>
