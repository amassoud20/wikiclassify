				<span class='text'>The event may have contributed to her subsequent miscarriage</span>
				<span class='text'>The book was an examination of free will and morality</span>
				<span class='text'>The young [[anti-hero]], [[Alex DeLarge|Alex]], captured after a short career of violence and mayhem, undergoes a course of [[aversion therapy]] treatment to curb his violent tendencies</span>
				<span class='text'>This results in making him defenceless against other people and unable to enjoy some of his favourite music that, besides violence, had been an intense pleasure for him</span>
				<span class='text'>In the non-fiction book ''Flame into Being'' (1985) Burgess described ''A Clockwork Orange'' as &quot;a jeu d'esprit knocked off for money in three weeks, it became known as the raw material for a film which seemed to glorify sex and violence</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He added &quot;the film made it easy for readers of the book to misunderstand what it was about, and the misunderstanding will pursue me till I die</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Near the time of publication the final chapter was cut from the American edition of the book</span>
				<span class='text'>Burgess had written ''A Clockwork Orange'' with twenty-one chapters, meaning to match the [[age of majority]]</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;21 is the symbol of human maturity, or used to be, since at 21 you got to vote and assumed adult responsibility,&quot; Burgess wrote in a foreword for a 1986 edition</span>
				<span class='text'>Needing money and thinking that the publisher was &quot;being charitable in accepting the work at all,&quot; Burgess accepted the deal and allowed ''A Clockwork Orange'' to be published in the US with the twenty-first chapter omitted</span>
				<span class='text'>Stanley Kubrick's film adaptation of ''A Clockwork Orange'' was based on the American edition, and thus helped to perpetuate the loss of the last chapter</span>
				<span class='text'>n [[Martin Seymour-Smith]]'s ''Novels and Novelists: A Guide to the World of Fiction,'' Burgess related that he would often prepare a synopsis with a name-list before beginning a project</span>
				<span class='text'>Seymour-Smith wrote: &quot;Burgess believes overplanning is fatal to creativity and regards his unconscious mind and the act of writing itself as indispensable guides</span>
				<span class='text'>He does not produce a draft of a whole novel but prefers to get one page finished before he goes on to the next, which involves a good deal of revision and correction</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;''[[Nothing Like the Sun: A Story of Shakespeare's Love Life|Nothing Like the Sun]]'' is a fictional recreation of [[Shakespeare]]'s love-life and an examination of the supposedly partly syphilitic sources of the bard's imaginative vision</span>
				<span class='text'>The novel, which drew on [[Edgar I</span>
				<span class='text'>Fripp]]'s 1938 biography ''Shakespeare, Man and artist,'' won critical acclaim and placed Burgess among the first rank novelists of his generation</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[M/F]]'' (1971) was listed by the writer himself as one of the works of which he was most proud</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[Beard's Roman Women]]'' was revealing on a personal level, dealing with the death of his first wife, his bereavement, and the affair that led to his second marriage</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''[[Napoleon Symphony]],'' Burgess brought [[Napoleon|Bonaparte]] to life by shaping the novel's structure to [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s ''[[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>3 (Beethoven)|Eroica]]'' symphony</span>
				<span class='text'>The novel contains a portrait of an [[Arab]] and [[Muslim]] society under occupation by a Christian western power ([[Egypt]] by [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[First French Empire|France]])</span>
				<span class='text'>In the 1980s, religious themes began to feature heavily (''[[The Kingdom of the Wicked]],'' ''[[Man of Nazareth]],'' ''[[Earthly Powers]]'')</span>
				<span class='text'>Though Burgess lapsed from Catholicism early in his youth, the influence of the Catholic &quot;training&quot; and worldview remained strong in his work all his life</span>
				<span class='text'>This is notable in the discussion of free will in ''A Clockwork Orange,'' and in the apocalyptic vision of devastating changes in the Catholic Church&amp;nbsp;– due to what can be understood as Satanic influence&amp;nbsp;– in ''[[Earthly Powers]]'' (1980)</span>
				<span class='text'>urgess kept working through his final illness and was writing on his deathbed</span>
				<span class='text'>The late novel ''[[Any Old Iron (novel)|Any Old Iron]]'' is a generational saga of two families, one Russian-Welsh, the other Jewish, encompassing the sinking of the Titanic, World War I, the Russian Revolution, the Spanish Civil War, World War II, the early years of the State of Israel, and the rediscovery of [[Excalibur]]</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[A Dead Man in Deptford]],'' about [[Christopher Marlowe]], is a companion novel to ''[[Nothing Like the Sun: A Story of Shakespeare's Love Life|Nothing Like the Sun]]</span>
				<span class='text'>' The verse novel ''[[Byrne: A Novel|Byrne]]'' was published posthumously</span>
				<span class='text'>==Critical studies===Burgess started his career as a critic</span>
				<span class='text'>His ''English Literature, A Survey for Students'', was aimed at newcomers to the subject</span>
				<span class='text'>He followed this with ''The Novel To-day'' (Longmans, 1963) and ''The Novel Now: A Student's Guide to Contemporary Fiction'' (New York: W</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Norton and Company, 1967)</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote the [[James Joyce|Joyce]] studies ''Here Comes Everybody: An Introduction to James Joyce for the Ordinary Reader'' (also published as ''Re Joyce'') and ''[[Joysprick|Joysprick: An Introduction to the Language of James Joyce]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Also published was ''A Shorter '[[Finnegans Wake]]'',' Burgess's abridgement</span>
				<span class='text'>His 1970 ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' entry on the novel (under &quot;Novel, the&quot;) is regarded as a classic of the genre</span>
				<span class='text'>{By whom|date=September 2010}} Burgess wrote full-length critical studies of William Shakespeare, Ernest Hemingway and D</span>
				<span class='text'>H</span>
				<span class='text'>Lawrence, as well as ''[[Ninety-nine Novels]]: The Best in English since 1939''</span>
