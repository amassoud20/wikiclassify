				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Cesare Borgia]]In contrast to the preceding pontificate, Pope Alexander VI adhered initially to strict administration of justice and orderly government</span>
				<span class='text'>Before long, he began endowing his relatives at the church's and at his neighbours' expense</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Cesare Borgia]], his son, while a youth of seventeen and a student at [[Pisa]], was made [[Archbishop]] of [[Province of Valencia|Valencia]], and [[Giovanni Borgia, 2nd Duke of Gandia|Giovanni Borgia]] inherited the Spanish Dukedom of [[Gandia]], the Borgias' ancestral home in Spain</span>
				<span class='text'>For the Duke of Gandia and for [[Gioffre Borgia|Gioffre]], also known as Goffredo, the Pope proposed to carve fiefs out of the [[Papal States]] and the [[Kingdom of Naples]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Among the fiefs destined for the duke of Gandia were [[Cerveteri]] and [[Anguillara]], lately acquired by [[Virginio Orsini]], head of that powerful house</span>
				<span class='text'>This policy brought [[Ferdinand I of Naples|Ferdinand I, King of Naples]], into conflict with Pope Alexander VI, who was also opposed by Cardinal della Rovere, whose candidature for the papacy had been backed by Ferdinand</span>
				<span class='text'>Della Rovere fortified himself in his [[bishop of Ostia|bishopric of Ostia]] at the [[Tiber]]'s mouth as Pope Alexander VI formed a league against Naples (25 April 1493) and prepared for war</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Villari&quot;/&gt;Ferdinand allied himself with [[Florence]], [[Milan]] and [[Venice]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also appealed to Spain for help, but Spain was eager to be on good terms with the papacy to obtain the title to the recently discovered [[New World]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ope Alexander VI, in the bull ''[[Inter Caetera]]'', 4 May 1493, divided the title between Spain and Portugal along a demarcation line</span>

				<span class='text'>|Italy 1494]]{{Refimprove section|date=April 2014}}Pope Alexander VI made many alliances to secure his position</span>
				<span class='text'>He sought help from [[Charles VIII of France]] (1483–1498), who was allied to [[Ludovico Sforza|Ludovico &quot;Il Moro&quot; Sforza]] (the Moor, so called because of his swarthy complexion), the ''de facto'' Duke of Milan, who needed French support to legitimise his rule</span>
				<span class='text'>As King Ferdinand I of Naples was threatening to come to the aid of the rightful duke Gian Galeazzo, the husband of his granddaughter Isabella, Alexander VI encouraged the French king in his plan for the conquest of Naples</span>
				<span class='text'>ut Pope Alexander VI, always ready to seize opportunities to aggrandize his family, then adopted a double policy</span>
				<span class='text'>Through the intervention of the Spanish ambassador he made peace with Naples in July 1493 and cemented the peace by a marriage between his son Gioffre and [[Sancha of Aragon|Doña Sancha]], another granddaughter of Ferdinand I</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Burchard/&gt; In order to dominate the [[College of Cardinals|Sacred College of Cardinals]] more completely, Alexander, in a move that created much scandal, created 12 new cardinals</span>
				<span class='text'>Among the new cardinals was his own son Cesare, then only 18 years old</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Pope Paul III|Alessandro Farnese]] (later Pope Paul III), the brother of one of the Pope's mistresses, [[Giulia Farnese]], was also among the newly created cardinals</span>
				<span class='text'>n 25 January 1494, Ferdinand I died and was succeeded by his son [[Alfonso II of Naples|Alfonso II]] (1494–1495)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Burchard/&gt; [[Charles VIII of France]] now advanced formal claims on the Kingdom of Naples</span>
				<span class='text'>Pope Alexander VI authorised him to pass through Rome, ostensibly on a [[crusade]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]], without mentioning Naples</span>
				<span class='text'>But when the French invasion became a reality Pope Alexander VI became alarmed, recognised Alfonso II as king of Naples, and concluded an alliance with him in exchange for various fiefs for his sons (July 1494)</span>
				<span class='text'>A military response to the French threat was set in motion: a Neapolitan army was to advance through the [[Romagna]] and attack Milan, while the fleet was to seize [[Genoa]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Both expeditions were badly conducted and failed, and on 8 September Charles VIII crossed the [[Alps]] and joined Lodovico il Moro at Milan</span>
				<span class='text'>The Papal States were in turmoil, and the powerful [[Colonna]] faction seized [[Ostia (district)|Ostia]] in the name of France</span>
				<span class='text'>Charles VIII rapidly advanced southward, and after a short stay in Florence, set out for Rome (November 1494)</span>
				<span class='text'>ope Alexander VI appealed to [[Ascanio Sforza]] and even to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Sultan]] [[Bayazid II]] for help</span>
				<span class='text'>He tried to collect troops and put Rome in a state of defence, but his position was precarious</span>
				<span class='text'>When the Orsini offered to admit the French to their castles, Alexander had no choice but to come to terms with Charles</span>
				<span class='text'>n 31 December, Charles VIII entered Rome with his troops, the cardinals of the French faction, and Giuliano della Rovere</span>
				<span class='text'>Pope Alexander VI now feared that Charles might depose him for [[simony]], and that the king would summon a council to nominate a new pope</span>
				<span class='text'>Pope Alexander VI was able to win over the [[Guillaume Briçonnet (Cardinal)|bishop of Saint-Malo]], who had much influence over the king, with a cardinal's hat</span>
				<span class='text'>Pope Alexander VI agreed to send Cesare as legate to Naples with the French army; to deliver [[Cem Sultan]], held as a hostage, to Charles VIII, and to give Charles [[Civitavecchia]] (16 January 1495)</span>
				<span class='text'>On 28 January Charles VIII departed for Naples with Cem and Cesare, but the latter slipped away to [[Spoleto]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Neapolitan resistance collapsed, and Alfonso II fled and abdicated in favour of his son [[Ferdinand II of Naples|Ferdinand II]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Ferdinand was abandoned by all and also had to escape, and the Kingdom of Naples was conquered with surprising ease</span>
				<span class='text'>=The French in retreat=={{Refimprove section|date=April 2014}}A reaction against Charles VIII soon set in, for all the European powers were alarmed at his success</span>
				<span class='text'>On 31 March 1495 the [[Holy League (1495)|Holy League]] was formed between the Pope, the emperor, [[Venice]], [[Lodovico il Moro]] and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand of Spain]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The League was ostensibly formed against the Turks, but in reality it was made to expel the French from Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>Charles VIII had himself crowned King of [[Naples]] on 12 May, but a few days later began his retreat northward</span>
				<span class='text'>He met the allies at [[Battle of Fornovo|Fornovo]], and after a drawn battle cut his way through them and was back in France by November</span>
				<span class='text'>Ferdinand II was reinstated at [[Naples]] soon afterwards, with Spanish help</span>
				<span class='text'>The expedition, if it produced no material results, demonstrated the foolishness of the so-called 'politics of equilibrium', the Medicean doctrine of preventing one of the Italian principates from overwhelming the rest and uniting them under its hegemony</span>
				<span class='text'>harles VIII's belligerence in Italy had made it transparent that the 'politics of equilibrium' did nothing but render the country unable to defend itself against a powerful invading force</span>
				<span class='text'>Italy was shown to be very vulnerable to the predations of the powerful nation-states, France and Spain, that had forged themselves during the previous century</span>
				<span class='text'>Alexander VI now followed the general tendency of all the princes of the day to crush the great feudatories and establish a centralized despotism</span>
				<span class='text'>In this manner, he was able to take advantage of the defeat of the French in order to break the power of the Orsini</span>
				<span class='text'>From that time on, Alexander was able to build himself an effective power base in the Papal States</span>

				<span class='text'>Peace was made through Venetian mediation, the Orsini paying 50,000 ducats in exchange for their confiscated lands; the Duke of Urbino, whom they had captured, was left by the Pope to pay his own ransom</span>
				<span class='text'>The Orsini remained very powerful, and Pope Alexander VI could count on none but his 3,000 Spanish troops</span>
				<span class='text'>His only success had been the capture of Ostia and the submission of the Francophile cardinals Colonna and [[Savelli]]</span>
				<span class='text'>hen occurred a major domestic tragedy for the house of Borgia</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Villari&quot;/&gt;Pope Alexander VI, overwhelmed with grief, shut himself up in [[Castel Sant'Angelo]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He declared that henceforth the moral reform of the [[Catholic Church|Church]] would be the sole object of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>Every effort was made to discover the assassin, and suspicion fell on various highly placed people</span>
				<span class='text'>Enquiries suddenly ceased without explanation</span>
				<span class='text'>Cesare was suspected but not until much later and he was never named in the immediate aftermath, nor would there have been any particular reason for him to commit such a crime</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Villari&quot;/&gt; The Orsini, against whom the Duke had been involved in the recent campaign, were the principal suspects at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>The Duke had many other enemies</span>
				<span class='text'>Ascanio Sforza, for example, had had a terrible row with him just a few days before the murder</span>
				<span class='text'>No conclusive explanation was ever reached,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Mallett|1981|pp=162–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it may be that the crime was simply as a result of one of the Duke's sexual liaisons</span>
				<span class='text'>{#tag:ref|&quot;Next morning the absence of the Duke was noticed by his servants, and the Pontiff was informed</span>
				<span class='text'>He was not too worried for, as Burchard says, Alexander jumped to the conclusion that his son had spent the night with some girl and preferred to avoid the indiscretion of leaving by day</span>
				<span class='text'>It may be mentioned in passing that this touch, as with many others one comes across, hardly squares with the general view that the Pope, his family and those around him were without shame</span>
				<span class='text'>Juan was a dissolute young man and not a churchman, yet Alexander presumed on a discretion more in keeping with later times</span>

				<span class='text'>It was pointed out that on the third [of August 1503] the two of them had dined with the recently appointed [[Adriano Castellesi|Cardinal Adriano Castellesi]] in his nearby villa; the rumor rapidly spread around Rome that they had intended to poison their host but had inadvertently drunk the poisoned wine themselves</span>
				<span class='text'>For some reason this mildly ridiculous story has survived and found its way into a number of serious histories; it ignores the fact that</span>

				<span class='text'>Opponents such as the powerful demagogic Florentine friar [[Girolamo Savonarola]] launched invectives against papal corruption and appealed for a general council to confront the papal abuses</span>
				<span class='text'>Alexander is reported to have been reduced to laughter when Savonarola's denunciations were related to him</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, he appointed [[Sebastian Maggi]] to investigate the friar, and he responded on 16 October 1495:{{bq|text=&quot;We are displeased at the disturbed state of affairs in Florence, the more so in that it owes its origin to your preaching</span>
				<span class='text'>For you predict the future and publicly declare that you do so by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit when you should be reprehending vice and praising virtue</span>
				<span class='text'>Such prophecies may easily lure the simple-minded away from the path of salvation and the obedience due to the Holy Roman Church</span>
				<span class='text'>Prophecies like these should not be made when your charge is to forward peace and concord</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Since, however, we have been most happy to learn from certain cardinals and from your letter that you are ready to submit yourself to the reproofs of the Church, as becomes a Christian and a religious, we are beginning to think that what you have done has not been done with an evil motive, but from a certain simple-mindedness and a zeal, however misguided, for the Lord's vineyard</span>
				<span class='text'>Our duty, however, prescribes that we order you, under holy obedience, to cease from public and private preaching until you are able to come to our presence, not under armed escort as is your present habit, but safely, quietly and modestly as becomes a religious, or until we make different arrangements</span>

				<span class='text'>Thus, the prominent Italian families looked down on the Borgia family, and they resented their power, which they sought for themselves</span>
				<span class='text'>This is, at least partially, why both Pope Callixtus III and Pope Alexander VI gave powers to family members whom they could trust</span>
				<span class='text'>{#tag:ref|&quot;We need now to digress a little to explain why the Pope should bestow his favours so generously on his own relatives</span>
				<span class='text'>Let us take a look first at the political situation in Spain and in Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>For centuries, Spain had been almost completely overridden by the Moors</span>
				<span class='text'>The Spaniards had been trying to take back their country from the Moors for almost 800 years</span>
				<span class='text'>By the middle of the 15th century, this reconquest was almost complete, but Spain was still a hodgepodge of competing principalities and, because of its constant state of warfare, still a very backward country</span>
				<span class='text'>In Italy, on the other hand, the Renaissance, which had hardly begun in Spain, had reached its high point and the Italians in general did not look kindly on a citizen of this backward country being elevated to the highest post in the Church</span>
				<span class='text'>Remember, too, that the Pope at the time, besides his spiritual powers, was a sovereign political power with large areas of the peninsula, nominally, at least, under his control</span>
				<span class='text'>(see map) Italy was, politically, in a worse state than Spain</span>
				<span class='text'>In the south, Naples was a fief of the Pope, but its ruler, King Ferrante, refused to acknowledge the Pope's authority</span>
				<span class='text'>In the north of the peninsula, many small principalities vied for dominance and were often at war with one another, changing alliances as rapidly as opportunity invited</span>
				<span class='text'>In the Papal States themselves, noble families, such as the Orsini and the Colonna, acted as petty tyrants in the cities and areas which they controlled, grinding down the people and constantly seeking to achieve their independence from their sovereign, the Pope</span>
				<span class='text'>These Roman families even sought to control the Papacy itself</span>
				<span class='text'>It was probably only because they could not agree on an Italian successor to Nicholas V that the elderly Callistus had been elected; one who, in all probability, would not live long</span>
				<span class='text'>(Remember that, in our own times, John XXIII was supposed to have been elected for the same reason)</span>
				<span class='text'>Callistus III was acknowledged by all as religious and austere, though severely criticized for his largesse to his family</span>
				<span class='text'>But he was surrounded by enemies both within the Church and among the rulers of Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>When elected, he did what all leaders do, he surrounded himself with people whom he believed he could trust</span>
				<span class='text'>A Spaniard in Italy, he was hard pressed to find such trustworthiness except from members of his own family; hence his patronage of them, though it is not to be denied that it was probably also for personal reasons</span>

				<span class='text'>He had annulled Lucrezia's marriage to [[Giovanni Sforza]], who had responded to the suggestion that he was impotent with the unsubstantiated counter-claim that Pope Alexander VI and Cesare indulged in incestuous relations with Lucrezia, in 1497</span>
				<span class='text'>{#tag:ref|&quot;As for her reputation, there is absolutely no evidence for the rumors of incest with one or more of her brothers -- or indeed with her father -- apart from that given by her first husband, Giovanni Sforza, during the divorce proceedings, during which several other baseless accusations were leveled in both directions</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Norwich|2011|p=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} And, unable to arrange a union between Cesare and the daughter of [[Frederick IV of Naples|King Frederick IV of Naples]] (who had succeeded Ferdinand II the previous year), he induced Frederick by threats to agree to a marriage between the Duke of [[Bisceglie]], a natural son of Alfonso II, and Lucrezia</span>
				<span class='text'>Cesare, after resigning his cardinalate, was sent on a mission to France at the end of the year, bearing a bull of divorce for the new French king [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]], in exchange for which he obtained the duchy of [[Valentinois]] (a duchy chosen because it was consistent with his already known nickname of Valentino), a promise of material assistance in his schemes to subjugate the feudal princelings of papal Romagna, and a marriage to a princess of [[Navarre]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ope Alexander VI hoped that Louis XII's help would be more profitable to his house than that of Charles VIII had been</span>
				<span class='text'>In spite of the remonstrances of Spain and of the Sforza, he allied himself with France in January 1499 and was joined by [[Venice]]</span>
				<span class='text'>By autumn Louis XII was in Italy expelling Lodovico Sforza from [[Milan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>With French success seemingly assured, the Pope determined to deal drastically with the [[Romagna]], which although nominally under papal rule was divided into a number of practically independent lordships on which Venice, Milan, and Florence cast hungry eyes</span>
				<span class='text'>Cesare, empowered by the support of the French, began to attack the turbulent cities one by one in his capacity as nominated ''[[Gonfalone of the Church|gonfaloniere]]'' (standard bearer) of the church</span>
				<span class='text'>But the expulsion of the French from Milan and the return of Lodovico Sforza interrupted his conquests, and he returned to Rome early in 1500</span>

				<span class='text'>It lasted until 1618 when another door was installed in the new basilica</span>

				<span class='text'>His goods were confiscated and many other members of the clan in Rome were arrested, while Alexander's son Goffredo Borgia led an expedition into the Campagna and seized their castles</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus the two great houses of Orsini and Colonna, who had long fought for predominance in Rome and often flouted the Pope's authority, were subjugated and the Borgias' power increased</span>
				<span class='text'>Cesare then returned to Rome, where his father asked him to assist Goffredo in reducing the last Orsini strongholds; this for some reason he was unwilling to do, much to his father's annoyance; but he eventually marched out, captured [[Ceri]] and made peace with Giulio Orsini, who surrendered [[Bracciano]]</span>
