				<span class='text'>He is known as '''Chiang Chung-cheng''' (蔣中正, Jiang Zhongzheng) or  '''Chiang Chieh-shih''' (蔣介石, Jiang Jieshi) in [[Standard Chinese]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Chiang was an influential member of the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT), the Chinese Nationalist Party, and was a close ally of [[Sun Yat-sen]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He became the [[Commandant]] of the Kuomintang's [[Whampoa Military Academy]] and took Sun's place as leader of the KMT when Sun died in 1925</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1926, Chiang led the [[Northern Expedition (1926–1927)|Northern Expedition]] to unify the country, becoming China's nominal leader</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=a&gt;{{Cite book|last=Zarrow|first=Peter Gue|year=2005|title=China in War and Revolution, 1895–1949|pages=230–231}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as Chairman of the [[National Military Council]] of the Nationalist government of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] (ROC) from 1928 to 1948</span>
				<span class='text'>Chiang led China in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (the Chinese theater of [[World War II]]), consolidating power from the party's [[Warlord Era|former regional warlords]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Unlike Sun Yat-sen, Chiang Kai-shek was socially conservative, promoting traditional Chinese culture in the [[New Life Movement]] and rejecting western democracy and the [[Socialist ideology of the Kuomintang|nationalist democratic socialism]] that Sun embraced in favour of an authoritarian government</span>
				<span class='text'>hiang's predecessor, Sun Yat-sen, was well-liked and respected by the Communists, but after Sun's death Chiang was not able to maintain good relations with the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP)</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Shanghai massacre of 1927|A major split]] between the Nationalists and Communists occurred in 1927; and, under Chiang's leadership, the Nationalists fought a nationwide [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]] against the Communists</span>
				<span class='text'>After [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japan invaded China in 1937]], Chiang agreed to a temporary truce with the CCP</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite some [[Battle of Taierzhuang|early cooperative military successes against Japan]], by the time that the Japanese surrendered in 1945 neither the CCP nor the KMT trusted or was actively cooperating with the other</span>
				<span class='text'>fter the [[Marshall Mission]], an American-sponsored attempt to negotiate a coalition government, failed in 1946, the Chinese Civil War resumed</span>
				<span class='text'>The CCP defeated the Nationalists in 1949</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Odd Arne Westad|Westad]] says the Communists won the Civil War because they made fewer military mistakes than Chiang Kai-Shek, and because in his search for a powerful centralized government, Chiang antagonized too many interest groups in China</span>
				<span class='text'>Furthermore, his party was weakened in the war against Japan</span>
				<span class='text'>Meanwhile, the Communists told different groups, such as peasants, exactly what they wanted to hear, and cloaked themselves in the cover of Chinese Nationalism</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Odd Arne Westad, ''Restless Empire: China and the World Since 1750'' (2012) p</span>
				<span class='text'>291&lt;/ref&gt;Chiang's government and army retreated to [[Taiwan]], where Chiang imposed [[martial law]] and persecuted people critical of his rule in a period known as the &quot;[[White Terror (Taiwan)|White Terror]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>After evacuating to Taiwan, Chiang's government continued to declare its intention to retake mainland China</span>
				<span class='text'>Chiang ruled Taiwan securely as [[President of the Republic of China]] and General of the Kuomintang until his [[s:Translation:Will of Chiang Kai-shek|death in 1975]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Early life=====Childhood===[[File:Chiang Kaishek in Baoding Military Academy</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|200px|Chiang Kai-shek in 1907 at the Baoding Military Academy]]Chiang was born in [[Xikou, Fenghua|Xikou]], a town approximately {{convert|30|km|sp=uk}} southwest of [[Ningbo]] city centre, in [[Fenghua]], [[Zhejiang]]</span>
				<span class='text'>However, his [[Ancestral home (China)|ancestral home]], a concept important in Chinese society, was the town of Heqiao ({{lang|zh-hant|和橋鎮}}) in [[Yixing]], [[Jiangsu]], approximately {{convert|38|km|abbr=on}} southwest of central [[Wuxi]], and {{convert|10|km|abbr=on}} from the shores of [[Lake Tai]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Chiang's father, Jiang Zhaocong ({{lang|zh-hant|蔣肇聰}}), and mother, Wang Caiyu ({{lang|zh|王采玉}}), were members of an upper-middle to upper-class family of salt merchants</span>
				<span class='text'>Chiang's father died when he was only eight years of age, and he wrote of his mother as the &quot;embodiment of Confucian virtues&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>==In Japan: 1905–1911===Chiang grew up at a time in which military defeats and civil strife between warlords had left China destabilized and in debt</span>
				<span class='text'>Successive demands of [[Western powers]] and of Japan since the [[Opium War]]s of 1839-1860 had left China owing millions of [[tael]]s of silver</span>
				<span class='text'>He decided to pursue a military career</span>
				<span class='text'>He began his military education at the [[Baoding Military Academy]] in 1906 - coincidentally in the same year that Japan devalued its paper currency ([[promissory notes]]), de-pairing it with gold and silver</span>
				<span class='text'>He then left for the ''[[Tokyo Shinbu Gakko]]'' ({{lang|zh-hant|東京振武學校}}), an [[Imperial Japanese Army Academy]] Preparatory School for Chinese students, in 1907</span>
				<span class='text'>There came under the influence of compatriots to support the revolutionary movement to overthrow the [[Qing Dynasty]] and to set up a Chinese republic</span>
				<span class='text'>He befriended fellow Zhejiang native [[Chen Qimei]], and in 1908 Chen brought Chiang into the [[Tongmenghui]], a precursor of the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) organization</span>
				<span class='text'>Chiang served in the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] from 1909 to 1911</span>
				<span class='text'>==Return to China===Chiang returned to China in 1911 after learning of the outbreak of the [[Wuchang Uprising]], intending to fight as an artillery officer</span>
				<span class='text'>He served in the revolutionary forces, where he led a regiment in Shanghai under his friend and mentor [[Chen Qimei]], as one of Chen's chief lieutenants</span>
				<span class='text'>In early 1912, a dispute arose between Chen and Tao Chen-Chang, who was an influential member of the Revolutionary Alliance and who opposed both Sun Yat-sen and Chen</span>
				<span class='text'>Tao sought to avoid escalating the quarrel by hiding in a hospital but was discovered there by Chiang</span>
				<span class='text'>Chen dispatched assassins</span>
				<span class='text'>Chiang may not have taken part in the act but would later assume responsibility to help Chen avoid trouble</span>
				<span class='text'>Chen valued Chiang despite Chiang's by now legendary quick temper, believing that such bellicosity was useful in a military leader</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor2009p24, 31&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|2009|pp=24, 31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, Professor Pichon Loh reports that Chiang may have killed Tao in the hospital with a pistol</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Loh |first=Pichon |title=The Early Chiang Kai-shek |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=1971 |page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;Chiang's friendship with Chen Qimei signaled an association with Shanghai's criminal syndicate (the [[Green Gang]] headed by [[Du Yuesheng]] and Huang Jinrong)</span>
				<span class='text'>During Chiang's time in Shanghai, he was watched by British-administered [[Shanghai International Settlement]] police, who charged him with various felonies</span>
				<span class='text'>These charges never resulted in a trial and Chiang was never jailed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Loh 1971, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>20, 133</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Chiang became a founding member of the KMT after the success of the [[Xinhai Revolution|1911 Revolution]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After the takeover of the Republican government by [[Yuan Shikai]] and the failed [[Second Revolution]] in 1913, Chiang, like his KMT comrades, divided his time between exile in Japan and the havens of the [[Shanghai International Settlement]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In Shanghai, Chiang cultivated ties with the city's underworld gangs, which were dominated by the notorious Green Gang and its leader Du Yuesheng</span>
				<span class='text'>On May 18, 1916, agents of Yuan Shikai assassinated Chen Qimei</span>
				<span class='text'>Chiang then succeeded Chen as leader of the [[Chinese Revolutionary Party]] in Shanghai</span>
				<span class='text'>Sun Yat-sen's political career was at its lowest point during this time when most of his old Revolutionary Alliance comrades refused to join him in the exiled Chinese Revolutionary Party</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor2009p25-26&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|2009|pp=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;===Establishment of the Kuomintang in Guangzhou===In 1917, Sun Yat-sen moved his base of operations to [[Guangzhou]], and Chiang joined him in 1918</span>
				<span class='text'>At this time Sun remained largely sidelined; and, without arms or money, was soon expelled from Guangzhou and exiled again to Shanghai</span>
				<span class='text'>He was restored to Guangzhou with mercenary help in 1920</span>
				<span class='text'>After returning to Guangzhou, a rift developed between Sun, who sought to militarily unify China under the KMT, and Guangdong Governor [[Chen Jiongming]], who wanted to implement a [[federalist]] system with Guangdong as a model province</span>
				<span class='text'>On June 16, 1923, Chen attempted to assassinate Sun and had his residence shelled</span>
				<span class='text'>During a prolonged skirmish between the troops of these opposing forces, Sun and his wife [[Soong Ching-ling]] narrowly evaded heavy machine gun fire and were rescued by gunboats under Chiang's direction</span>
				<span class='text'>The incident earned Chiang the trust of Sun Yat-sen</span>
				<span class='text'>un regained essential control of Guangzhou in early 1924, again with the help of mercenaries from [[Yunnan]], and accepted aid from the [[Comintern]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Undertaking a reform of the KMT, he established a revolutionary government aimed at unifying China under the KMT</span>
				<span class='text'>That same year, Sun sent Chiang to spend three months in Moscow studying the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] political and military system</span>
				<span class='text'>During his trip in Russia, Chiang met [[Leon Trotsky]] and other Soviet leaders, but quickly came to the conclusion that the Russian model of government was not suitable for China</span>
				<span class='text'>Chiang later sent his eldest son, Ching-kuo, to study in Russia</span>
				<span class='text'>After his father's split from the [[First United Front]] in 1927, Ching-kuo was forced to stay there, as a hostage, until 1937</span>
				<span class='text'>Chiang wrote in his diary, &quot;It is not worth it to sacrifice the interest of the country for the sake of my son</span>

				<span class='text'>Chiang resigned from the office for one month in disagreement with Sun's extremely close cooperation with the Comintern, but returned at Sun's demand</span>
				<span class='text'>The early years at Whampoa allowed Chiang to cultivate a cadre of young officers loyal to both the KMT and himself</span>
				<span class='text'>hroughout his rise to power, Chiang also benefited from membership within the nationalist [[Tiandihui]] fraternity, to which Sun Yat-sen also belonged, and which remained a source of support during his leadership of the Kuomintang</span>
				<span class='text'>=Succession of Sun Yat-sen=====Competition with Wang Jingwei===[[Sun Yat-sen]] died on March 12, 1925,&lt;ref name=sundeath&gt;{{Cite book|last=Eileen|first=Tamura|year=1998|title=China: Understanding Its Past|pages=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating a power vacuum in the [[Kuomintang]]</span>
				<span class='text'>A contest ensued between Chiang, who stood at the right wing of the KMT, and Sun Yat-sen's close comrade-in-arms [[Wang Jingwei]], who leaned towards the left</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Wang succeeded Sun as Chairman of the National Government, Chiang's relatively low position in the party's internal hierarchy was bolstered by his military backing and adept political maneuvering following the [[Zhongshan Warship Incident]]</span>
				<span class='text'>On June 5, 1926, Chiang became [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[National Revolutionary Army]] (NRA),&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor2009p57&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|2009|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on July 27 he launched a military campaign known as the [[Northern Expedition]] in order to defeat the warlords controlling northern China and to unify the country under the KMT</span>
				<span class='text'>he NRA branched into three divisions: to the west was Wang Jingwei, who led a column to take [[Wuhan]]; [[Bai Chongxi]]'s column went east to take Shanghai; Chiang himself led in the middle route, planning to take [[Nanjing]] before pressing ahead to capture Beijing</span>
				<span class='text'>However, in January 1927, Wang Jingwei and his KMT leftist allies took the city of Wuhan amid much popular mobilization and fanfare</span>
				<span class='text'>Allied with a number of [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communists]] and advised by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] agent [[Mikhail Borodin]], Wang declared the National Government as having moved to Wuhan</span>
				<span class='text'>Having taken Nanjing in March (and briefly visited Shanghai, now under the control of his close ally Bai Chongxi), Chiang halted his campaign and prepared a violent break with Wang's leftist elements, which he believed threatened his control of the KMT</span>
				<span class='text'>ow with an established national government in Nanjing, and supported by conservative allies including [[Hu Hanmin]], Chiang's expulsion of the Communists and their Soviet advisers led to the beginning of the [[Chinese Civil War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Wang Jingwei's National Government was weak militarily, and was soon ended by Chiang with the support of a local warlord ([[Li Zongren]] of [[Guangxi]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Eventually, Wang and his leftist party surrendered to Chiang and joined him in Nanjing</span>
				<span class='text'>In the [[Central Plains War]], Beijing was taken on June, 1928, from an alliance of the warlords [[Feng Yuxiang]] and [[Yan Xishan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In December, the [[Manchuria]]n warlord [[Zhang Xueliang]] pledged allegiance to Chiang's government, completing Chiang's nominal unification of China and ending the [[Warlord Era]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1927, when he was setting up the Nationalist government in Nanjing, he was preoccupied with &quot;the elevation of our leader Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Sun Yat-sen to the rank of 'Father of our Chinese Republic'</span>
				<span class='text'>Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Sun worked for 40 years to lead our people in the Nationalist cause, and we cannot allow any other personality to usurp this honored position&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He asked [[Chen Guofu]] to purchase a photograph that had been taken in Japan around 1895 or 1898</span>
				<span class='text'>It showed members of the Revive China Society with [[Yeung Kui-wan]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|楊衢雲}} or {{lang|zh-Hans|杨衢云}}, [[pinyin]] Yáng Qúyún) as President, in the place of honour, and Sun, as secretary, on the back row, along with members of the Japanese Chapter of the Revive China Society</span>
				<span class='text'>When told that it was not for sale, Chiang offered a million dollars to recover the photo and its negative</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;The party must have this picture and the negative at any price</span>
				<span class='text'>They must be destroyed as soon as possible</span>
				<span class='text'>It would be embarrassing to have our Father of the Chinese Republic shown in a subordinate position&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>hiang made great efforts to gain recognition as the official successor of Sun Yat-sen</span>
				<span class='text'>In a pairing of great political significance, Chiang was Sun's brother-in-law: he had married [[Soong Mei-ling]], the younger sister of [[Soong Ching-ling]], Sun's widow, on December 1, 1927</span>
				<span class='text'>Originally rebuffed in the early 1920s, Chiang managed to ingratiate himself to some degree with Soong Mei-ling's mother by first divorcing his wife and concubines and promising to sincerely study the precepts of [[Christianity]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He read the copy of the Bible that May-ling had given him twice before making up his mind to become a Christian, and three years after his marriage he was baptized in the Soong's [[Methodist]] church</span>
				<span class='text'>Although some observers felt that he adopted Christianity as a political move, studies of his recently opened diaries suggest that his faith was strong and sincere and that he felt that Christianity reinforced Confucian moral teachings</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor2009p91&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|2009|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;Upon reaching Beijing, Chiang paid homage to Sun Yat-sen and had his body moved to the new capital of Nanjing to be enshrined in a [[Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum|grand mausoleum]]</span>

				<span class='text'>On October 10, 1928, Chiang was named director of the State Council, the equivalent to President of the country, in addition to his other titles</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|2009|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with his predecessor Sun Yat-sen, the Western media dubbed him &quot;[[Generalissimo]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor2009p57&quot;/&gt;According to [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s plans, the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) was to rebuild China in three steps: [[Martial law|military rule]], political tutelage, and constitutional rule</span>
				<span class='text'>The ultimate goal of the KMT revolution was democracy, which was not considered to be feasible in China's fragmented state</span>
				<span class='text'>Since the KMT had completed the first step of revolution through seizure of power in 1928, Chiang's rule thus began a period of what his party considered to be &quot;political tutelage&quot; in Sun Yat-sen's name</span>
				<span class='text'>During this so-called Republican Era, many features of a modern, functional Chinese state emerged and developed</span>
				<span class='text'>he decade of 1928 to 1937 saw some aspects of foreign [[imperialism]], concessions and privileges in China, moderated through diplomacy</span>
				<span class='text'>The government acted to modernize the legal and penal systems, attempted to stabilize prices, amortize debts, reform the banking and currency systems, build railroads and highways, improve public health facilities, legislate against traffic in [[narcotic]]s, and augment industrial and agricultural production</span>
				<span class='text'>Not all of these projects were successfully completed</span>
				<span class='text'>Efforts were made towards improving education standards; and, in an effort to unify Chinese society, the [[New Life Movement]] was launched to encourage [[Confucianism|Confucian]] moral values and personal discipline</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[Standard Chinese|Guoyu]]'' (&quot;National language&quot;), was promoted as a [[Official language|standard tongue]], and the establishment of communications facilities (including radio) were used to encourage a sense of [[Chinese nationalism]] in a way that was not possible when the nation lacked an effective central government</span>
				<span class='text'>==Challenges and limitations===Any successes that the Nationalists did make, however, were met with constant political and military upheavals</span>
				<span class='text'>While much of the urban areas were now under the control of the KMT, much of the countryside remained under the influence of weakened yet undefeated warlords and Communists</span>
				<span class='text'>Chiang often resolved issues of warlord obstinacy through military action, but such action was costly in terms of men and material</span>
				<span class='text'>The 1930 [[Central Plains War]] alone nearly bankrupted the Nationalist government and caused almost {{formatnum:250000}} casualties on both sides</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1931, [[Hu Hanmin]], Chiang's old supporter, publicly voiced a popular concern that Chiang's position as both premier and president flew in the face of the democratic ideals of the Nationalist government</span>
				<span class='text'>Chiang had Hu put under [[house arrest]], but he was released after national condemnation after which he left Nanjing and supported a rival government in [[Guangzhou]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The split resulted in a military conflict between Hu's Guangzhou government and Chiang's Nationalist government</span>
				<span class='text'>Chiang only won the campaign against Hu after a shift in allegiance by the warlord [[Zhang Xueliang]], who had previously supported Hu Hanmin</span>
				<span class='text'>hroughout his rule, complete eradication of the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] remained Chiang's dream</span>
				<span class='text'>After assembling his forces in [[Jiangxi]], Chiang led his armies against the newly established [[Chinese Soviet Republic]]</span>
				<span class='text'>With help from foreign military advisers, Chiang's Fifth Campaign finally surrounded the [[People's Liberation Army|Chinese Red Army]] in 1934</span>
				<span class='text'>The Communists, tipped off that a Nationalist offensive was imminent, retreated in the [[Long March]], during which [[Mao Zedong]] rose from a mere military official to the most influential leader of the Communist Party of China</span>
				<span class='text'>==Ideology: nationalism, anti-capitalism, and anti-communism===Chiang, as a nationalist and a Confucianist, was against the iconoclasm of the [[May Fourth Movement]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Motivated by his sense of nationalism, he viewed some Western ideas as foreign, and he believed that the great introduction of Western ideas and literature that the May Fourth Movement promoted was not beneficial to China</span>

				<span class='text'>With over 200,000 Chinese casualties, Chiang lost the political cream of his [[Whampoa Military Academy|Whampoa]]-trained officers</span>
				<span class='text'>Though Chiang lost militarily, the battle dispelled Japanese claims that it could conquer China in three months and demonstrated to the Western powers that the Chinese would continue the fight</span>
				<span class='text'>By December, the capital city of Nanjing had fallen to the Japanese resulting in the [[Nanking Massacre|Rape of Nanking</span>
				<span class='text'>] Chiang moved the government inland, first to [[Wuhan]] and later to [[Chongqing]]</span>
				<span class='text'>aving lost most of China's economic and industrial centers, Chiang withdrew into the hinterlands, stretching the Japanese supply lines and bogging down Japanese soldiers in the vast Chinese interior</span>
				<span class='text'>As part of a policy of protracted resistance, Chiang authorized the use of [[Scorched earth#Second Sino-Japanese War|scorched earth]] tactics, resulting in many civilian deaths</span>
				<span class='text'>During the Nationalists' retreat from Zhengzhou, the dams around the city were deliberately destroyed by the Nationalist army in order to delay the Japanese advance, killing 500,000 people in the subsequent [[1938 Yellow River flood]]</span>
				<span class='text'>fter heavy fighting, the Japanese occupied Wuhan in the fall of 1938 and the Nationalists retreated farther inland, to Chongqing</span>
				<span class='text'>While en route to Chongqing, the Nationalist army intentionally started the [[1938 Changsha Fire|&quot;fire of Changsha&quot;]], as a part of the scorched earth policy</span>
				<span class='text'>The fire destroyed much of the city, killed twenty thousand civilians, and left hundreds of thousands of people homeless</span>
				<span class='text'>Due to an organizational error (it was claimed), the fire was begun without any warning to the residents of the city</span>
				<span class='text'>The Nationalists eventually blamed three local commanders for the fire and executed them</span>
				<span class='text'>Newspapers across China blamed the fire on (non-KMT) arsonists, but the blaze contributed to a nationwide loss of support for the KMT</span>

				<span class='text'>This was an unpopular move among a population that, for many, had spent more than a decade under often brutal foreign occupation</span>
				<span class='text'>American troops and weapons soon bolstered KMT forces, allowing them to reclaim cities</span>
				<span class='text'>The countryside, however, remained largely under Communist control</span>
				<span class='text'>or over a year after the Japanese surrender, rumours circulated throughout China that the Japanese had entered into a secret agreement with Chiang, in which the Japanese would assist the Nationalists in fighting the Communists in exchange for the protection of Japanese persons and property there</span>
				<span class='text'>Many top nationalist generals, including Chiang, had studied and trained in Japan before the Nationalists had returned to the mainland in the 1920s, and maintained close personal friendships with top Japanese officers</span>
				<span class='text'>The Japanese general in charge of all forces in China, General [[Yasuji Okamura]], had personally trained officers who later became generals in Chiang's staff</span>
				<span class='text'>Reportedly, General Okamura, before surrendering command of all Japanese military forces in Nanjing, offered Chiang control of all 1</span>
				<span class='text'>&amp;nbsp;million Japanese military and civilian support staff then present in China</span>
				<span class='text'>Reportedly, Chiang seriously considered accepting this offer, but declined only in the knowledge that the United States would certainly be outraged by the gesture</span>
				<span class='text'>Even so, armed Japanese troops remained in China well into 1947, with some noncommissioned officers finding their way into the Nationalist officer corps</span>

				<span class='text'>The government's official line for these martial law provisions stemmed from the claim that emergency provisions were necessary, since the Communists and KMT were still in a state of war</span>
				<span class='text'>Seeking to promote [[Chinese nationalism]], Chiang's government actively ignored and suppressed local cultural expression, even forbidding the use of local languages in mass media broadcasts or during class sessions</span>
				<span class='text'>he first decades after the Nationalists moved the seat of government to the province of Taiwan are associated with the organized effort to resist Communism known as the [[White Terror (Taiwan)|&quot;White Terror&quot;]], during which about 140,000 Taiwanese were imprisoned for their real or perceived opposition to the Kuomintang</span>
				<span class='text'>Most of those prosecuted were labeled by the Kuomintang as &quot;bandit spies&quot; (匪諜), meaning spies for Chinese Communists, and punished as such</span>

				<span class='text'>Despite these restrictions, free debate within the confines of the legislature was permitted</span>
				<span class='text'>Under the pretext that new elections could not be held in Communist-occupied constituencies, the National Assembly, [[Legislative Yuan]], and [[Control Yuan]] members held their posts indefinitely</span>
				<span class='text'>The Temporary Provisions also allowed Chiang to remain as president beyond the two-term limit in the Constitution</span>
				<span class='text'>He was reelected by the National Assembly as president four times—doing so in 1954, 1960, 1966, and 1972</span>
				<span class='text'>elieving that corruption and a lack of morals were key reasons that the KMT lost mainland China to the Communists, Chiang attempted to purge corruption by dismissing members of the KMT accused of graft</span>

				<span class='text'>Kung]] and [[T</span>
				<span class='text'>V</span>
				<span class='text'>Soong]], exiled themselves to the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>Though politically authoritarian and, to some extent, dominated by government-owned industries, Chiang's new Taiwanese state also encouraged economic development, especially in the export sector</span>
				<span class='text'>A popular sweeping Land Reform Act, as well as American foreign aid during the 1950s, laid the foundation for Taiwan's economic success, becoming one of the [[Four Asian Tigers]]</span>
				<span class='text'>fter Chiang's death, the next president, Chiang's son, [[Chiang Ching-kuo]], and Chiang Ching-kuo's successor, [[Lee Teng-hui]] a native Taiwanese, would, in the 1980s and 1990s, increase native Taiwanese representation in the government and loosen the many authoritarian controls of the early era of ROC control in Taiwan</span>

				<span class='text'>]In 1971, shortly after he had switched his country's [[diplomatic recognition]] from the Republic of China to the People's Republic of China, the Australian Prime Minister, [[Gough Whitlam]], visited Japan</span>
				<span class='text'>After meeting with the Japanese Prime Minister, [[Eisaku Sato]], Whitlam observed that the reason Japan at that time was hesitant to withdraw recognition from the Nationalist government was &quot;the presence of a treaty between the Japanese government and that of Chiang Kai-shek&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Sato explained that the continued recognition of Japan towards the Nationalist government was due largely to the personal relationship that various members of the Japanese government felt towards Chiang</span>
				<span class='text'>This relationship was rooted largely in the generous and lenient treatment of Japanese prisoners-of-war by the Nationalist government in the years immediately following the Japanese surrender in 1945, and was felt especially strongly as a bond of personal obligation by the most senior members then in power</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|250px|Statue of Chiang Kai-shek in [[Yangmingshan National Park]], Taiwan]]Chiang's legacy has been the target of heated debates because of the different views held about him</span>
				<span class='text'>For some, Chiang was a national hero who led the victorious [[Northern Expedition]] against the [[Beiyang government|Beiyang Warlords]] in 1927, achieving [[Chinese reunification (1928)|Chinese unification]], and who subsequently led China to ultimate victory against [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] in 1945</span>
				<span class='text'>Some blamed him for not doing enough against the Japanese forces in the lead-up to, and during, the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], preferring to withhold his armies for the fight against the Communists, or merely waiting and hoping that the United States would get involved</span>
				<span class='text'>Some also see him as a champion of [[anti-Communism]], being a key figure during the formative years of the [[World Anti-Communist League]]</span>
				<span class='text'>During the [[Cold War]], he was also seen as the leader who led [[Free area of the Republic of China|Free China]] and the bulwark against a possible Communist invasion</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Chiang presided over purges, political authoritarianism, and graft during his tenure in mainland China, and ruled throughout a period of imposed [[martial law]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His governments were accused of being corrupt even before he even took power in 1928</span>
				<span class='text'>He also allied with known criminals like [[Du Yuesheng]] for political and financial gains</span>
				<span class='text'>Some opponents charge that Chiang's efforts in developing Taiwan were mostly to make the island a strong base from which to one day return to mainland China, and that Chiang had little regard for the long-term prosperity and well-being of the [[Taiwanese people]]</span>
				<span class='text'>oday, Chiang's popularity in Taiwan is divided along political lines, enjoying greater support among Kuomintang supporters</span>
				<span class='text'>He is generally unpopular among [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) voters and supporters</span>
				<span class='text'>In sharp contrast to his son, [[Chiang Ching-kuo]], and to [[Sun Yat-sen]], his memory is rarely invoked by current political parties, including the Kuomintang</span>
				<span class='text'>n the United States and Europe, Chiang was often perceived negatively as the one who lost China to the Communists</span>
				<span class='text'>His constant demands for Western support and funding also earned him the nickname of &quot;General Cash-My-Check&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>In the West he has been criticized for his poor military skills</span>
				<span class='text'>He had a record of issuing unrealistic orders and persistently attempting to fight unwinnable battles, leading to the loss of his best troops</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fenby|first=Jonathan|title=History of Modern China|pages=279}}&lt;/ref&gt;In recent years, there has been an attempt to find a more moderate interpretation of Chiang</span>
				<span class='text'>Chiang is now increasingly perceived as a man simply overwhelmed by the events in China, having to fight simultaneously Communists, Japanese and provincial warlords while having to reconstruct and unify the country</span>
				<span class='text'>His sincere, albeit often unsuccessful attempts to build a more powerful nation have been noted by scholars such as [[Jonathan Fenby]] and [[Rana Mitter]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Mitter has observed that, ironically, today's China is closer to Chiang's vision than to [[Mao Zedong]]'s</span>
				<span class='text'>He argues that the Communists, since the 1980s, have essentially created the state envisioned by Chiang in the 1930s</span>

				<span class='text'>That inscribed in the genealogical records of his family is '''Jiang Zhoutai''' ({{zh|c=蔣周泰|w='''Chiang Chou-tai'''}})</span>
				<span class='text'>This so-called &quot;register name&quot; (譜名) is the one under which his extended relatives knew him, and the one he used in formal occasions, such as when he got married</span>
				<span class='text'>In deference to tradition, family members did not use the register name in conversation with people outside of the family</span>
				<span class='text'>In fact, the concept of real or original name is not as clear-cut in China as it is in the Western world</span>
				<span class='text'>n honor of tradition, Chinese families waited a number of years before officially naming their offspring</span>
				<span class='text'>In the meantime, they used a &quot;milk name&quot; (乳名), given to the infant shortly after his birth and known only to the close family</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, the actual name that Chiang received at birth was '''Jiang Ruiyuan''' ({{zh|c=蔣瑞元|w='''Chiang Jui-yuan'''}})</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1903, the 16-year-old Chiang went to [[Ningbo]] to be a student, and he chose a &quot;school name&quot; (學名)</span>
				<span class='text'>This was actually the formal name of a person, used by older people to address him, and the one he would use the most in the first decades of his life (as the person grew older, younger generations would have to use one of the [[courtesy name]]s instead)</span>
				<span class='text'>(Colloquially, the school name is called &quot;big name&quot; (大名), whereas the &quot;milk name&quot; is known as the &quot;small name&quot; (小名)</span>
				<span class='text'> The school name that Chiang chose for himself was Zhiqing ({{zh|c=志清|w=Chi-ching}}; means &quot;purity of intentions&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>For the next fifteen years or so, Chiang was known as '''Jiang Zhiqing''' ([[Wade-Giles]]: '''Chiang Chi-ching''')</span>
				<span class='text'>This is the name under which [[Sun Yat-sen]] knew him when Chiang joined the republicans in [[Guangzhou]] in the 1910s</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1912, when Jiang Zhiqing was in Japan, he started to use the name '''Chiang Kai-shek''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 蔣介石; [[Pinyin]]: {{Audio|Zh-Jiang_Jieshi</span>
				<span class='text'>gg|'''Jiang Jieshi'''}}; [[Wade-Giles]]: Chiang Chieh-shih) as a pen name for the articles that he published in a Chinese magazine he founded: ''Voice of the Army'' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 軍聲)</span>
				<span class='text'>(''Jieshi'' is the [[Pinyin]] romanization of the name, based on [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], but the common romanized rendering is ''Kai-shek'' which is in [[Cantonese|Cantonese romanization]]</span>
				<span class='text'>As the republicans were based in Canton (a Cantonese speaking area, now commonly known as Guangzhou), Chiang became known by Westerners under the Cantonese romanization of his courtesy name, while the family name as known in English seems to be the Mandarin pronunciation of his Chinese family name, transliterated in [[Wade-Giles]])[[File:Cihu President Chiang Mausoleum entrance</span>
				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|right|The entrance to Chiang's tombsite at [[Tzuhu]] (Cihu) uses the official posthumous rendering of Chiang Kai-shek (''[[Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts|from right to left]]''): The President (space) Lord Chiang Mausoleum</span>
				<span class='text'>]&quot;Kai-shek&quot; soon became his [[courtesy name]] (字)</span>
				<span class='text'>Some think the name was chosen from the classic Chinese book the ''[[I Ching]]''; others note that the first character of his courtesy name is also the first character of the courtesy name of his brother and other male relatives on the same generation line, while the second character of his courtesy name ''shi'' (石—meaning &quot;stone&quot;) suggests the second character of his &quot;register name&quot; ''tai'' (泰—the famous [[Mount Tai]] of China)</span>
				<span class='text'>Courtesy names in China often bore a connection with the personal name of the person</span>
				<span class='text'>As the courtesy name is the name used by people of the same generation to address the person, Chiang soon became known under this new name</span>
				<span class='text'>ometime in 1917 or 1918, as Chiang became close to [[Sun Yat-sen]], he changed his name from Jiang Zhiqing to '''Jiang Zhongzheng''' ({{zh|c=蔣中正|w='''Chiang Chung-cheng'''}})</span>
				<span class='text'>By adopting the name Chung-cheng (&quot;central uprightness&quot;), he was choosing a name very similar to the name of Sun Yat-sen, who was (and still is) known among Chinese as Zhongshan (中山—meaning &quot;central mountain&quot;), thus establishing a link between the two</span>
				<span class='text'>The meaning of uprightness, rectitude, or orthodoxy, implied by his name, also positioned him as the legitimate heir of Sun Yat-sen and his ideas</span>
				<span class='text'>Not surprisingly, the Chinese Communists always rejected the use of this name and it is not well known in [[mainland China]]</span>
				<span class='text'>However, it was readily accepted by members of the [[Kuomintang|Chinese Nationalist Party]] and is the name under which Chiang Kai-shek is still commonly known in Taiwan</span>
				<span class='text'>Often the name is shortened to &quot;Chung-cheng&quot; only (&quot;Zhongzheng&quot; in Pinyin)</span>
				<span class='text'>For many years passengers arriving at the [[Chiang Kai-shek International Airport]] were greeted by signs in Chinese welcoming them to the &quot;Chung Cheng International Airport&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Similarly, the monument erected to Chiang's memory in Taipei, known in English as [[Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall]], was literally named &quot;Chung Cheng Memorial Hall&quot; in Chinese</span>
				<span class='text'>In Singapore, [[Chung Cheng High School]] was named after him</span>
				<span class='text'>is name is also written in Taiwan as &quot;'''The Late President Lord Chiang'''&quot; (先總統　蔣公), where the one-character-wide space known as [[nuo tai]] shows respect; this practice has lost some popularity</span>
				<span class='text'>However, he is still known as ''Lord Chiang'' (蔣公) (without the title or space), along with the name ''Chiang Chung-cheng'', in Taiwan</span>

				<span class='text'>While married to Mao, Chiang adopted two [[concubine]]s (concubinage was still a common practice for well-to-do, non-Christian males in China): he married Yao Yecheng (姚冶誠, 1889–1972) in 1912 and [[Chen Jieru]] (陳潔如, 1906–1971) in December 1921</span>
				<span class='text'>While he was still living in Shanghai, Chiang and Yao adopted a son, [[Chiang Wei-kuo|Wei-kuo]]</span>

				<span class='text'>The three Muslim governors, known as [[Xibei San Ma]] (lit</span>

				<span class='text'>Chiang's appointments, the first time that Muslims had been appointed as governors of Gansu, increased the prestige of Muslim officials in northwestern China</span>
				<span class='text'>The armies raised by this &quot;Ma Clique&quot;, most notably their Muslim cavalry, were incorporated into the KMT army</span>
				<span class='text'>Chiang appointed a Muslim General, [[Bai Chongxi]], as the Minister of National Defence of the Republic of China, which controlled the ROC military</span>
				<span class='text'>hiang also supported the Muslim General Ma Zhongying, whom he had trained at [[Whampoa Military Academy]] during the [[Kumul Rebellion]], in a [[Jihad]] against [[Jin Shuren]], [[Sheng Shicai]], and the Soviet Union during the [[Soviet Invasion of Xinjiang]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Chiang designated Ma's Muslim army as the [[36th Division (National Revolutionary Army)]] and gave his troops [[Kuomintang]] flags and uniforms</span>
