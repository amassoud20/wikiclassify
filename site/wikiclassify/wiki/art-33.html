				<span class='text'>In the twentieth year of the Buddha's ministry, he became the Buddha's personal attendant, accompanying him on most of his wanderings and taking the part of [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutor]] in many of the recorded [[dialogues]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He is the subject of a special [[panegyric]] delivered by the Buddha just before the Buddha's [[Parinibbana]] (the [[Mahaparinibbana Sutta]] ([[Digha Nikaya|DN]] 16)); it is a panegyric for a man who is kindly, unselfish, popular, and thoughtful toward others</span>

				<span class='text'> Therefore, he is often called the disciple of the Buddha who &quot;heard much&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>At the [[Buddhist councils|First Buddhist Council]], convened shortly after the Buddha died, Ananda was called upon to recite many of the discourses that later became the [[Sutta Pitaka]] of the [[Pāli Canon]]</span>
				<span class='text'>espite his long association with and close proximity to the Buddha, Ananda was only a [[Sotapanna|stream-winner]] prior to the Buddha’s death</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Buddha said that the purity of his heart was so great that, &quot;Should Ananda die without being fully liberated; he would be king of the gods seven times because of the purity of his heart, or be king of the Indian subcontinent seven times</span>
