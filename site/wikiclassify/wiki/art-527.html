				<span class='text'>They are known as the [[Twenty-six Martyrs of Japan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>They included five European [[Franciscan]] [[missionary|missionaries]], one [[Philip of Jesus|Mexican Franciscan]] missionary, three Japanese [[Jesuits]] and seventeen Japanese [[laymen]] including three young boys</span>

				<span class='text'>Japanese troops remained pinned down in [[Gyeongsang]] province</span>
				<span class='text'>In June 1598, the Japanese forces turned back several Chinese offensives in [[Suncheon, Jeonnam|Suncheon]] and [[Sacheon]], but they were unable to make further progress as the Ming army prepared for a final assault</span>
				<span class='text'>The Koreans continually harassed Japanese forces through guerrilla warfare</span>
				<span class='text'>While Hideyoshi's battle at Sacheon was a major Japanese victory, all three parties to the war were exhausted</span>
				<span class='text'>He told his commander in Korea, &quot;''Don't let my soldiers become spirits in a foreign land''</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes&quot;/&gt; ==Death==Toyotomi Hideyoshi died September 18, 1598</span>
				<span class='text'>His death was kept secret by the [[Council of Five Elders]] to preserve morale, and the Japanese forces in Korea were ordered to withdraw back to Japan by the Council of Five Elders</span>
				<span class='text'>Because of his failure to capture Korea, Hideyoshi's forces were unable to invade China</span>
				<span class='text'>Rather than strengthen his position, the military expeditions left his clan's coffers and fighting strength depleted, his vassals at odds over responsibility for the failure, and the clans that were loyal to the Toyotomi name weakened</span>
				<span class='text'>The dream of a Japanese conquest of China was put on hold indefinitely</span>
				<span class='text'>The Tokugawa government later not only prohibited any further military expeditions to the Asian mainland, but closed Japan to nearly all foreigners during the years of the [[Tokugawa Shogunate]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It was not until the late 19th century that Japan [[First Sino-Japanese War|again fought a war]] against China through Korea, using much the same route that Hideyoshi's invasion force had used</span>
				<span class='text'>fter his death, the other members of the Council of Five Regents were unable to keep the ambitions of [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] in check</span>
				<span class='text'>Two of Hideyoshi's [[Seven Spears of Shizugatake|top generals]], [[Katō Kiyomasa]] and [[Fukushima Masanori]], had fought bravely during the war but returned to find the Toyotomi clan castellan [[Ishida Mitsunari]] in power</span>
				<span class='text'>He held the generals in contempt, and they sided with Tokugawa Ieyasu</span>
				<span class='text'>Hideyoshi's underage son and designated successor Hideyori lost the power his father once held, and Tokugawa Ieyasu was declared Shogun following the [[Battle of Sekigahara]] in 1600</span>

				<span class='text'>]Toyotomi Hideyoshi changed Japanese society in many ways</span>
				<span class='text'>These include imposition of a rigid class structure, restriction on travel, and surveys of land and production</span>
				<span class='text'>[Separation Edict|Class reforms]] affected commoners and warriors</span>
				<span class='text'>During the [[Sengoku period]], it had become common for peasants to become warriors, or for samurai to farm due to the constant uncertainty caused by the lack of centralized government and always tentative peace</span>
				<span class='text'> Upon taking control, Hideyoshi decreed that all peasants be disarmed completely</span>

				<span class='text'>21-22</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This solidified the social class system for the next 300 years</span>
				<span class='text'>urthermore, he ordered comprehensive surveys and a [[Population Census Edict|complete census]] of Japan</span>
				<span class='text'>Once this was done and all citizens were registered, he required all Japanese to stay in their respective ''[[Han (administrative division)|han]]'' (fiefs) unless they obtained official permission to go elsewhere</span>
				<span class='text'> This ensured order in a period when bandits still roamed the countryside and peace was still new</span>
				<span class='text'>The land surveys formed the basis for systematic taxation</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;&quot;Bateren-tsuiho-rei&quot; (the Purge Directive Order to the Jesuits) Article 10&lt;/ref&gt;Hideyoshi also influenced the material culture of Japan</span>
				<span class='text'>He lavished time and money on the tea ceremony,  collecting implements, sponsoring lavish social events, and patronizing acclaimed masters</span>
				<span class='text'>As interest in the tea ceremony rose among the ruling class, so too did demand for fine ceramic implements, and during the course of the Korean campaigns, not only were large quantities of prized ceramic ware confiscated, many Korean artisans were forcibly relocated to Japan</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Inspired by the dazzling [[Kinkaku-ji|Golden Pavilion]] in Kyoto, he also constructed a fabulous portable tea room, covered with gold leaf and lined inside with red gossamer</span>
				<span class='text'>Using this mobile innovation, he was able to practice the [[tea ceremony]] wherever he went, powerfully projecting his unrivaled power and status upon his arrival</span>
				<span class='text'>olitically, he set up a governmental system that balanced out the most powerful Japanese warlords (or [[daimyo]])</span>
				<span class='text'> A council was created to include the most influential lords</span>
				<span class='text'> At the same time, a regent was designated to be in command</span>
				<span class='text'>ust prior to his death, Hideyoshi hoped to set up a system stable enough to survive until his son grew old enough to become the next leader</span>

				<span class='text'>Following the death of [[Maeda Toshiie]], however, Tokugawa Ieyasu began to secure alliances, including political marriages (which had been forbidden by Hideyoshi)</span>

				<span class='text'>At [[genpuku]] he took the name {{nihongo|Kinoshita Tōkichirō|木下 藤吉郎||}}</span>
				<span class='text'>Later, he was given the surname Hashiba, and the honorary court office Chikuzen no Kami; as a result he was styled {{nihongo|Hashiba Chikuzen no Kami Hideyoshi|羽柴筑前守秀吉|}}</span>
				<span class='text'>His surname remained Hashiba even as he was granted the new ''uji'' or ''sei'' ({{lang|ja|氏}} or {{lang|ja|姓}}, clan name) Toyotomi by the emperor</span>
				<span class='text'>His name is correctly Toyotomi no Hideyoshi</span>
				<span class='text'>Using the [[Kyūjitai|writing system of his time]], his name is written as 豐臣 秀吉</span>
				<span class='text'>he Toyotomi ''uji'' was simultaneously granted to a number of Hideyoshi's chosen allies, who adopted the new ''uji'' &quot;{{lang|ja|豊臣朝臣}}&quot; (Toyotomi no asomi, courtier of Toyotomi)</span>
				<span class='text'>he Catholic sources of the time referred to him as &quot;emperor Taicosama&quot; (from ''taikō'', a retired ''kampaku'' (see [[Sesshō and Kampaku]]), and the honorific ''[[japanese titles|sama]]'')</span>
				<span class='text'>oyotomi Hideyoshi had been given the nickname Kozaru, meaning &quot;little monkey&quot;, from his lord Oda Nobunaga because his facial features and skinny form resembled that of a monkey</span>
