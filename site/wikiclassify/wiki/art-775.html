				<span class='text'>he principal creative responsibility for a number of the churches is now more commonly attributed to others in his office, especially [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]]</span>

				<span class='text'>The [[Wren Building]], the main building at the [[College of William and Mary]], is attributed to Wren</span>
				<span class='text'>It is the oldest academic building in continuous use in the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>ducated in [[Latin]] and [[Aristotelian physics]] at the [[University of Oxford]], Wren was a notable [[anatomist]], [[astronomer]], [[geometer]], and mathematician-[[physicist]], as well as an architect</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a founder of the [[Royal Society]] (president 1680–82), and his scientific work was highly regarded by [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Blaise Pascal]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Christopher Sr</span>
				<span class='text'>was at that time the rector of East Knoyle and later [[Dean of Windsor]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It was while they were living at East Knoyle that all their children were born; Mary, Catherine, and Susan were all born by 1628 but then several children were born who died within a few weeks of their birth</span>
				<span class='text'>Their son Christopher was born in 1632 then, two years later, another daughter named Elizabeth was born</span>
				<span class='text'>Mary must have died shortly after the birth of Elizabeth, although there does not appear to be any surviving record of the date</span>
				<span class='text'>Through Mary Cox, however, the family became well off financially for, as the only heir, she had inherited her father's estate</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wren|Ames|Wren|1750}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a sickly child, he would survive into robust old age</span>
				<span class='text'>He was first taught at home by a private tutor and his father</span>
				<span class='text'>After his father's royal appointment as [[Dean of Windsor]] in March 1635, his family spent part of each year there, but little is known about Wren's life at Windsor</span>
				<span class='text'>He spent his first eight years at East Knoyle and was educated by the Rev</span>
				<span class='text'>William Shepherd, a local clergyman</span>

				<span class='text'>ov</span>
				<span class='text'>k&quot;/&gt;Little is known of Wren's schooling thereafter, during dangerous times when his father's Royal associations would have required the family to keep a very low profile from the ruling Parliamentary authorities</span>
				<span class='text'>It was a tough time in his life, but one which would go on to have a significant impact upon his later works</span>
				<span class='text'>The story that he was at [[Westminster School]] between 1641 and 1646 is substantiated only by ''Parentalia'', the biography compiled by his son, a fourth Christopher, which places him there &quot;for some short time&quot; before going up to Oxford (in 1650); however, it is entirely consistent with headmaster [[Richard Busby|Doctor Busby]]'s well-documented practice of educating the sons of impoverished Royalists and Puritans alike, irrespective of current politics or his own position</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date = October 2015}}[[File:Wadham College</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|[[Wadham College]], Oxford, where Wren was a student in 1650–51]]Some of Wren's youthful exercises preserved or recorded (though few are datable) showed that he received a thorough grounding in [[Latin]] and also learned to draw</span>
				<span class='text'>According to ''Parentalia'', he was &quot;initiated&quot; in the principles of mathematics by Dr [[William Holder]], who married Wren's elder sister Susan (or Susanna) in 1643</span>
				<span class='text'>His drawing was put to academic use in providing many of the anatomical drawings for the anatomy textbook of the brain, Cerebri Anatome (1664), published by [[Thomas Willis]], which coined the term &quot;neurology</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;   During this time period, Wren manifested an interest in the design and construction of mechanical instruments</span>
				<span class='text'>It was probably through Holder that Wren met [[Sir Charles Scarburgh]] whom Wren assisted in his anatomical studies</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date = October 2015}}On 25 June 1650, Wren entered [[Wadham College, Oxford]], where he studied [[Latin]] and the works of [[Aristotle]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It is anachronistic to imagine that he received scientific training in the modern sense</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Wren became closely associated with [[John Wilkins]], the Warden of Wadham</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Wilkins circle]] was a group whose activities led to the formation of the [[Royal Society]], comprising a number of distinguished mathematicians, creative workers and experimental philosophers</span>
				<span class='text'>This connection probably influenced Wren's studies of science and mathematics at Oxford</span>
				<span class='text'>He graduated B</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>in 1651, and two years later received M</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>] in 1653, Wren was elected a fellow of [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls College]] in the same year and began an active period of research and experiment in Oxford</span>
				<span class='text'>His days as a fellow of All Souls ended when Wren was appointed Professor of Astronomy at [[Gresham College]], London in 1657</span>
				<span class='text'>He was provided with a set of rooms and a stipend and was required to give weekly lectures in both [[Latin]] and English to all who wished to attend; admission was free</span>
				<span class='text'>Wren took up this new work with enthusiasm</span>
				<span class='text'>He continued to meet the men with whom he had frequent discussions in Oxford</span>
				<span class='text'>They attended his London lectures and in 1660, initiated formal weekly meetings</span>
				<span class='text'>It was from these meetings that the Royal Society, England's premier scientific body, was to develop</span>
				<span class='text'>He undoubtedly played a major role in the early life of what would become the Royal Society; his great breadth of expertise in so many different subjects helping in the exchange of ideas between the various scientists</span>
				<span class='text'>In fact, the report on one of these meetings reads:{{quote|Memorandum November 28, 1660</span>
				<span class='text'>These persons following according to the usual custom of most of them, met together at Gresham College to hear Mr Wren's lecture, viz</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Lord Brouncker]], [[Robert Boyle|Mr Boyle]], Mr Bruce, [[Sir Robert Moray]], [[Paul Neile|Sir Paule Neile]], Dr Wilkins, Dr Goddard, [[William Petty|Dr Petty]], Mr Ball, Mr Rooke, Mr Wren, Mr Hill</span>

				<span class='text'>quot; This body received its Royal Charter from [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and &quot;The Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge&quot; was formed</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition to being a founder member of the Society, Wren was president of the Royal Society from 1680 to 1682</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date = October 2015}}In 1661, Wren was elected [[Savilian Chair of Astronomy|Savilian Professor]] of [[Astronomy]] at Oxford, and in 1669 he was appointed Surveyor of Works to Charles II</span>
				<span class='text'>From 1661 until 1668 Wren's life was based in Oxford, although his attendance at meetings of the Royal Society meant that he had to make occasional trips to London</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date = October 2015}}The main sources for Wren's scientific achievements are the records of the Royal Society</span>
				<span class='text'>His scientific works ranged from astronomy, [[optics]], the problem of finding [[longitude]] at sea, [[cosmology]], [[mechanics]], [[microscopy]], [[surveying]], medicine and [[meteorology]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He observed, measured, dissected, built models and employed, invented and improved a variety of instruments</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date = October 2015}}===1665–1723===It was probably around this time that Wren was drawn into redesigning a battered [[St Paul's Cathedral]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Making a trip to Paris in 1665, Wren studied the architecture, which had reached a climax of creativity, and perused the drawings of [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]], the great Italian sculptor and architect, who himself was visiting Paris at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>Returning from Paris, he made his first design for St Paul's</span>
				<span class='text'>A week later, however, the [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire]] destroyed two-thirds of the city</span>
				<span class='text'>Wren submitted his plans for rebuilding the city to King Charles II, although they were never adopted</span>
				<span class='text'>With his appointment as King's Surveyor of Works in 1669, he had a presence in the general process of rebuilding the city, but was not directly involved with the rebuilding of houses or companies' halls</span>
				<span class='text'>Wren was personally responsible for the rebuilding of [[List of Christopher Wren churches in London|51 churches]]; however, it is not necessarily true to say that each of them represented his own fully developed design</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date = October 2015}}Wren was [[knight]]ed 14 November 1673</span>
				<span class='text'>This honour was bestowed on him after his resignation from the Savilian chair in Oxford, by which time he had already begun to make his mark as an architect, both in services to the Crown and in playing an important part in rebuilding London after the Great Fire</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date = October 2015}}Additionally, he was sufficiently active in public affairs to be returned as Member of [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] for Old Windsor in 1680, 1689 and 1690, but did not take his seat</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date = October 2015}}By 1669 Wren's career was well established and it may have been his appointment as [[Office of Works|Surveyor of the King's Works]] in early 1669 that persuaded him that he could finally afford to take a wife</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1669 the 37-year-old Wren married his childhood neighbour, the 33-year-old Faith Coghill, daughter of Sir John Coghill of [[Bletchingdon]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Little is known of Faith's life or demeanour, but a love letter from Wren survives, which reads, in part:{{quote|I have sent your Watch at last &amp; envy the felicity of it, that it should be soe near your side &amp; soe often enjoy your Eye</span>

				<span class='text'>This letter was part of a package</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt;}}This brief marriage produced two children: Gilbert, born October 1672, who suffered from convulsions and died at about 18 months old, and Christopher, born February 1675</span>
				<span class='text'>The younger Christopher was trained by his father to be an architect</span>
				<span class='text'>It was this Christopher that supervised the topping out ceremony of [[St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's]] in 1710 and wrote the famous ''[[Parentalia, or, Memoirs of the family of the Wrens]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Faith Wren died of [[smallpox]] on 3 September 1675</span>
				<span class='text'>She was buried in the [[chancel]] of [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] beside the infant Gilbert</span>
				<span class='text'>A few days later Wren's mother-in-law, Lady Coghill, arrived to take the infant Christopher back with her to Oxfordshire to raise</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date = October 2015}}In 1677, 17 months after the death of his first wife, Wren remarried, this time to Jane Fitzwilliam, daughter of [[William FitzWilliam, 2nd Baron FitzWilliam]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date = October 2015}}She was a mystery to Wren's friends and companions</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Robert Hooke]], who often saw Wren two or three times every week, had, as he recorded in his diary, never even heard of her, and was not to meet her till six weeks after the marriage</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tinniswood|2001|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with the first marriage, this too produced two children: a daughter Jane (1677–1702); and a son William, &quot;Poor Billy&quot; born June 1679, who was developmentally delayed</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date = October 2015}}Like the first, this second marriage was also brief</span>
				<span class='text'>Jane Wren died of [[tuberculosis]] in September 1680</span>
				<span class='text'>She was buried alongside Faith and Gilbert in the chancel of St Martin-in-the-Fields</span>
				<span class='text'>Wren was never to marry again; he lived to be over 90 years old and of those years was married only nine</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date = October 2015}}Bletchingdon was the home of Wren's brother-in-law William Holder who was rector of the local church</span>
				<span class='text'>Holder had been a Fellow of [[Pembroke College, Oxford]]</span>
				<span class='text'>An intellectual of considerable ability, he is said to have been the figure who introduced Wren to arithmetic and geometry</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date = October 2015}}Wren's later life was not without criticisms and attacks on his competence and his taste</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1712, the ''Letter Concerning Design'' of [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Anthony Ashley Cooper]], third [[Earl of Shaftesbury]], circulated in manuscript</span>
				<span class='text'>Proposing a new British style of architecture, Shaftesbury censured Wren's cathedral, his taste and his long-standing control of royal works</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Wren was appointed to the Fifty New Churches Commission in 1711, he was left only with nominal charge of a board of works when the surveyorship started in 1715</span>
				<span class='text'>On 26 April 1718, on the pretext of failing powers, he was dismissed in favour of [[William Benson (architect)|William Benson]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date = October 2015}}===Death===The Wren family estate was at [[The Old Court House]] in the area of [[Hampton Court]]</span>

				<span class='text'>He had also been making observations of the planet [[Saturn]] from around 1652 with the aim of explaining its appearance</span>
				<span class='text'>His hypothesis was written up in ''De corpore saturni'' but before the work was published, [[Christiaan Huygens|Huygens]] presented his theory of the rings of Saturn</span>
				<span class='text'>Immediately Wren recognised this as a better hypothesis than his own and ''De corpore saturni'' was never published</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, he constructed an exquisitely detailed lunar model and presented it to the king</span>
				<span class='text'>Also his contribution to mathematics should be noted; in 1658, he found the length of an arc of the [[cycloid]] using an exhaustion proof based on dissections to reduce the problem to summing segments of chords of a circle which are in geometric progression</span>
				<span class='text'> year into Wren's appointment as a [[Savilian Chair of Astronomy|Savilian Professor]] in [[Oxford]], the [[Royal Society]] was created and Wren became an active member</span>
				<span class='text'>As Savilian Professor, Wren studied [[mechanics]] thoroughly, especially [[elastic collision]]s and [[pendulum]] motions</span>
				<span class='text'>He also directed his far-ranging intelligence to the study of [[meteorology]]: in 1662 he invented the tipping bucket [[rain gauge]] and, in 1663, designed a &quot;weather-clock&quot; that would record temperature, humidity, rainfall and barometric pressure</span>
				<span class='text'>A working weather clock based on Wren's design was completed by Robert Hooke in 1679</span>

				<span class='text'>Multhauf; United States National Museum Bulletin, 1961</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In addition, Wren experimented on muscle functionality, hypothesizing that the swelling and shrinking of muscles might proceed from a fermentative motion arising from the mixture of two heterogeneous fluids</span>
				<span class='text'>Although this is incorrect, it was at least founded upon observation and may mark a new outlook on medicine: specialisation</span>
				<span class='text'>nother topic to which Wren contributed was [[optics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He published a description of an engine to create perspective drawings and he discussed the grinding of conical lenses and mirrors</span>
				<span class='text'>Out of this work came another of Wren's important mathematical results, namely that the [[hyperboloid]] of revolution is a ruled surface</span>
				<span class='text'>These results were published in 1669</span>
				<span class='text'>In subsequent years, Wren continued with his work with the Royal Society, although after the 1680s his scientific interests seem to have waned: no doubt his architectural and official duties absorbed more time</span>
				<span class='text'>t was a problem posed by Wren that serves as an ultimate source to the conception of Newton's ''[[Principia Mathematica Philosophiae Naturalis]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Robert Hooke]] had theorised that planets, moving [[in vacuo]], describe orbits around the Sun because of a rectilinear inertial motion by the tangent and an accelerated motion towards the Sun</span>
				<span class='text'>Wren's challenge to [[Edmond Halley|Halley]] and Hooke, for the reward of a book worth thirty shillings, was to provide, within the context of Hooke's hypothesis, a mathematical theory linking the [[Kepler's laws]] with a specific force law</span>
				<span class='text'>Halley took the problem to Newton for advice, prompting the latter to write a nine-page answer, ''[[De motu corporum in gyrum]]'', which was later to be expanded into the ''Principia''</span>

				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;64–65&lt;/ref&gt;Mentioned above are only a few of Wren's scientific works</span>
				<span class='text'>He also studied other areas, ranging from agriculture, [[ballistics]], water and freezing, light and refraction, to name only a few</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Thomas Birch]]'s ''History of the Royal Society'' (1756–57) is one of the most important sources of our knowledge not only of the origins of the Society, but also the day-to-day running of the Society</span>
				<span class='text'>It is in these records that most of Wren's known scientific works are recorded</span>
				<span class='text'>=Architectural career==In Wren's age, the profession of architect as understood today did not exist</span>
				<span class='text'>Since the early years of the 17th century it was not unusual for the well-educated gentleman, (''virtuosi''), to take up architecture as a gentlemanly activity; a pursuit widely accepted as a branch of applied mathematics</span>
				<span class='text'>This is implicit in the writings of [[Vitruvius]] and explicit in such 16th century authors as [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] and [[Leonard Digges (scientist)|Leonard Digges]]</span>
				<span class='text'>When Wren was a student at Oxford, he became familiar with Vitruvius's ''De architectura'' and absorbed intuitively the fundamentals of the architectural design there</span>
				<span class='text'>In English Medieval tradition, buildings were constructed to the needs of the patron and the suggestions of building professionals, such as master carpenters or master bricklayers</span>
				<span class='text'>hrough the Royal Society and his use of optics, the King noticed Wren's works</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1661 he was approached by his cousin Matthew with a royal commission, as &quot;one of the best Geometers in Europe&quot;, to direct the re-fortification of [[Tangier]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Wren excused himself on grounds of health</span>
				<span class='text'>Although this invitation may have arisen from Charles II's casual opportunism in matching people to tasks, Wren is believed to have been already on the way to architecture practice</span>
				<span class='text'>Before the end of 1661 Wren was unofficially advising the repair of [[Old St Paul's Cathedral]] after two decades of neglect and distress; his architectural interests were also evident to his associates at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>Two years later, he set his only foreign journey to Paris and the [[Île-de-France]], during which he acquired the firsthand study of modern design and construction</span>
				<span class='text'>By this time, he had mastered and thoroughly understood architecture</span>
				<span class='text'>Unlike several of his colleagues who took it up as a set of rules and formulas for design, he possessed, understood, and exploited the combination of reason and intuition, experience and imagination</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Sir Christopher Wren: Natural Cause of Beauty''&lt;/ref&gt;Wren's first architectural project was the chapel of [[Pembroke College, Cambridge|Pembroke College]] in Cambridge, which his [[Matthew Wren|uncle]], the [[Bishop of Ely]], asked him to design in 1663</span>
				<span class='text'>The second was the design of the [[Sheldonian Theatre]] in [[Oxford]], completed in 1668</span>
				<span class='text'>This, the gift of Archbishop [[Gilbert Sheldon|Sheldon]] to his old university, was influenced by the classical form of the [[Theatre of Marcellus]] in Rome, but was a mixture of this classical design with a modern empirical design</span>
				<span class='text'>==St Paul's===[[St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's]] has always been the highlight of Wren's reputation</span>
				<span class='text'>His association with it spans his whole architectural career, including the 36 years between the start of the new building and the declaration by parliament of its completion in 1711</span>
				<span class='text'>ren had been involved in repairs of the old cathedral since 1661</span>
				<span class='text'>In the spring of 1666, he made his first design for a dome for [[St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It was accepted in principle on 27 August 1666</span>
				<span class='text'>One week later, however, the [[Great Fire of London]] reduced two-thirds of the City to a smoking desert and old St Paul's to a ruin</span>
				<span class='text'>Wren was most likely at Oxford at the time, but the news, so fantastically relevant to his future, drew him at once to London</span>
				<span class='text'>Between 5 and 11 September he ascertained the precise area of devastation, worked out a plan for rebuilding the City and submitted it to Charles II</span>
				<span class='text'>Others also submitted plans</span>
				<span class='text'>However, no new plan proceeded any further than the paper on which it was drawn</span>
				<span class='text'>A rebuilding act which provided rebuilding of some essential buildings was passed in 1667</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1669, the King's Surveyor of Works died and Wren was promptly installed</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:St Paul's - the Greek Cross design</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|Wren's [[Greek Cross]] design for St Paul's</span>
				<span class='text'>]It was not until 1670 that the pace of rebuilding started accelerating</span>
				<span class='text'>A second rebuilding act was passed that year, raising the tax on coal and thus providing a source of funds for rebuilding of churches destroyed within the [[City of London]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Wren presented his initial &quot;First Model&quot; for St Paul's</span>
				<span class='text'>This plan was accepted, and demolition of the old cathedral began</span>
				<span class='text'>By 1672, however, this design seemed too modest, and Wren met his critics by producing a design of spectacular grandeur</span>
				<span class='text'>This modified design, called &quot;Great Model&quot;, was accepted by the King and the construction started in November 1673</span>
				<span class='text'>However, this design failed to satisfy the [[Cathedral chapter|chapter]] and clerical opinion generally; moreover, it had an economic drawback</span>
				<span class='text'>Wren was confined to a &quot;cathedral form&quot; desired by the clergy</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1674 he produced the rather meagre Classical-Gothic compromise known as the Warrant Design</span>
				<span class='text'>However, this design, called so from the royal warrant of 14 May 1675 attached to the drawings, is not the design upon which work had begun a few weeks before</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:St Paul's - the final design</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|Wren's cathedral as built</span>
				<span class='text'>]The cathedral that Wren started to build bears only a slight resemblance to the Warrant Design</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1697, the first service was held in the cathedral when Wren was 65</span>
				<span class='text'>There was still, however, no dome</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally in 1711 the cathedral was declared complete, and Wren was paid the half of his salary that, in the hope of accelerating progress, [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] had withheld for 14 years since 1697</span>
				<span class='text'>The cathedral had been built for 36 years under his direction, and the only disappointment he had about his masterpiece was the dome: against his wishes the commission engaged Thornhill to paint the inner dome in false perspective and finally authorised a [[balustrade]] around the proof line</span>
				<span class='text'>This diluted the hard edge Wren had intended for his cathedral, and elicited the apt parthian comment that &quot;ladies think nothing well without an edging&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Hampton Court (1689–1702) by Wren]]During the 1670s Wren received significant secular commissions which manifest both the maturity and the variety of his architecture and the sensitivity of his response to diverse briefs</span>
				<span class='text'>mong many of his remarkable designs at this time, the [[Monument to the Great Fire of London|monument]] (1671–76)&lt;ref name=&quot;Downes1988p131&quot;/&gt; commemorating the Great Fire also involved [[Robert Hooke]], but Wren was in control of the final design, the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Royal Observatory]] (1675–76),&lt;ref name=&quot;Downes1988p131&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Downes|1988|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wren Library, Cambridge|the Wren library]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] (1676–84)&lt;ref name=&quot;Downes1988p131&quot;/&gt; were the most important ones</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:WrenLibraryCambridge</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Cambridge University, Wren Library, Trinity College]]In 1682, Wren advised that the original statues of the King's Beasts on [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle|St George's Chapel, Windsor]] be removed</span>
				<span class='text'>The pinnacles were left bare until 1925, when replica statues were installed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=London|first=H</span>
				<span class='text'>Stanford|title=The Queen's Beasts|publisher=Newman Neame|date=1953|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;By historical accident, all Wren's large-scale secular commissions dated from after the 1680s</span>
				<span class='text'>At the age of 50 his personal development, as was that of English architecture, was ready for a monumental but humane architecture, in which the scales of individual parts relates both to the whole and to the people who used them</span>
				<span class='text'>The first large project Wren designed, the [[Chelsea Hospital]] (1682–92),&lt;ref name=&quot;Downes1988p131&quot;/&gt; does not entirely satisfy the eye in this respect, but met its brief with distinction and such success that even in the 21st century it fulfills its original function</span>
				<span class='text'>The reconstruction of the state room at [[Windsor Castle]] was notable for the integration of architecture, sculpture and painting</span>
				<span class='text'>This commission was in the hand of [[Hugh May]], who died in February 1684, before the construction finished; Wren assumed his post and finalised the works</span>
				<span class='text'>fter the death of Charles II in 1685, Wren's attention was directed mainly to [[Whitehall]] (1685–87)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Downes1988p131&quot;/&gt; The new king, [[James II of England|James II]], required a new chapel and also ordered a new gallery, council chamber and a riverside apartment for the [[Mary of Modena|Queen]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Later, when James II was removed from the throne, Wren took on architectural projects such as [[Kensington Palace]] (1689–96)&lt;ref name=&quot;Downes1988p131&quot;/&gt; and [[Hampton Court]] (1689–1700)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Downes1988p131&quot;/&gt;Wren did not pursue his work on architectural design as actively as he had before the 1690s, although he still played important roles in a number of royal commissions</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1696 he was appointed Surveyor of [[Greenwich Hospital (London)|Greenwich Naval Hospital]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Downes1988p131&quot;/&gt; and in 1698 he was appointed Surveyor of [[Westminster Abbey]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jardine|2003|p=440}}&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned the former role in 1716 but held the latter until his death, approving with a wavering signature&lt;ref&gt;Westminster Abbey Muniments&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Burlington]]'s revisions of Wren's own earlier designs for the great Archway of Westminster School</span>
				<span class='text'>=Achievement and Legacy==At his death, Wren was 90</span>
				<span class='text'>Even the men he had trained and who owed much of their success to Wren's original and leadership were no longer young</span>
				<span class='text'>Newer generations of architects were beginning to look past Wren's style</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Baroque]] school his apprentices had created was already under fire from a new generation that brushed Wren's reputation aside and looked back beyond him to [[Inigo Jones]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Architects of the 18th century could not forget Wren, but they could not forgive some elements in his work they deemed unconventional</span>
				<span class='text'>The churches left the strongest mark on subsequent architecture</span>
				<span class='text'>In France, where English architecture rarely made much impression, the influence of St Paul's Cathedral can be seen in the church of Sainte-Geneviève (now the [[Panthéon]]); begun in 1757, it rises to a drum and dome similar to St Paul's, and there are other versions inspired by Wren's dome, from [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral|St Isaac's]] (1840–42) in [[St Petersburg]] to the [[United States Capitol|US Capitol]] at Washington, D</span>

				<span class='text'>The last major architect who admitted to being dependent on him was [[Sir Edwin Lutyens]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>With the purposeful elimination of historic influences from [[International Style (architecture)|international architecture in the early 20th century]], Wren's work gradually stopped being perceived as a mine of examples applicable to contemporary design</span>
				<span class='text'>=Freemasonry==Since at least the 18th century, the Lodge of Antiquity No</span>
				<span class='text'>2, one of the four founding Masonic Lodges of the [[Premier Grand Lodge of England]] in 1717, has claimed Christopher Wren to have been its Master at the ''Goose and Gridiron'' at [[St Paul's Cathedral|St</span>

				<span class='text'>et}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst he was rebuilding the cathedral he is said to have been &quot;adopted&quot; on 18 May 1691 (that is, accepted as a sort of honorary member or patron, rather than an operative)</span>
				<span class='text'>Their 18th-century maul with its 1827 inscription claiming that it was used by Wren for the foundation stone of St</span>
				<span class='text'>Pauls, belonging to the Lodge and on display in the Library and Museum of Freemasonry in London, corroborates the story</span>
				<span class='text'>[[James Anderson (Freemason)|Anderson]] made the claims in his widely circulated ''Constitutions'' while many of Wren's friends were still alive, but he made many highly creative claims as to the history or legends of Freemasonry</span>
				<span class='text'>There is also a clear possibility of confusion between the operative workmen's lodges which might naturally have welcomed the boss, and the &quot;speculative&quot; or gentlemen's lodges which became highly fashionable just after Wren's death</span>
				<span class='text'>By the standards of his time a gentleman like Wren would not generally join an artisan body{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}; however the workmen of St Paul's cathedral would naturally have sought the patronage or &quot;interest&quot; of their employer, and within Wren's lifetime there was a predominantly gentlemen's Lodge at the ''Rummer and Grapes'', a mile upriver at Westminster (where Wren had been to School)</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1788 the Lodge of Antiquity thought they were buying a portrait of Wren which now dominates Lodge Room 10, in the same building as the Museum; but it is now identified with [[William Talman (architect)|William Talman]], not Wren</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, this recorded event and many old records attest the fact that Antiquity thought that Wren had been its Master, at a time when it still held its minute books for the relevant years (which were lost by Preston at some date after 1778)</span>
				<span class='text'>he evidence whether Wren was a speculative freemason is the subject of the Prestonian Lecture&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; of 2011, which concludes on the evidence of two obituaries and [[Aubrey]]'s memoirs, with supporting materials, that he did indeed attend the closed meeting in 1691, probably of the Lodge of Antiquity, but that there is nothing to suggest that he was ever a Grand Officer as claimed by Anderson</span>
				<span class='text'>=Trivia==At one time Wren was credited with the design of the King's House at [[Newmarket, Suffolk]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The attribution gave rise to an apocryphal story in which [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who was over six feet tall, complained about the low ceilings</span>
				<span class='text'>Wren, who was not so tall, replied that &quot;They were high enough!&quot;, at which the king crouched down until he was on a level with his Surveyor and strutted about saying, &quot;Ay, Ay, Sir Christopher, I think they are high enough</span>
