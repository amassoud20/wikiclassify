				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|kyʁi|lang}}; 15 May 1859 – 19 April 1906) was a French [[Physics|physicist]], a pioneer in [[crystallography]], [[magnetism]], [[piezoelectricity]] and [[radioactivity]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1903 he received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] with his wife, [[Marie Curie|Marie Skłodowska-Curie]], and [[Henri Becquerel]], &quot;in recognition of the extraordinary services they have rendered by their joint researches on the radiation phenomena discovered by Professor Henri Becquerel&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>=Early life==Born in Paris, Pierre was the son of Eugène Curie (28 August 1827 – 25 February 1910) and Sophie-Claire Depouilly Curie (15 January 1832 – 27 September 1897)</span>
				<span class='text'>He was educated by his father, and in his early teens showed a strong aptitude for mathematics and geometry</span>
				<span class='text'>When he was 16, he earned his math degree</span>
				<span class='text'>By the age of 18 he had completed the equivalent of a higher degree, but did not proceed immediately to a doctorate due to lack of money</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead he worked as a laboratory instructor</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1880, Pierre and his older brother [[Jacques Curie|Jacques]] (1856–1941) demonstrated that an electric potential was generated when crystals were compressed, i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>[[piezoelectricity]]</span>
				<span class='text'>To provide accurate measurements needed for their work, Pierre created a highly sensitive instrument called the Curie Scale</span>
				<span class='text'>He used weights, microscopic meter readers, and pneumatic dampeners to create the scale</span>

				<span class='text'>Shortly afterwards, in 1881, they demonstrated the reverse effect: that crystals could be made to deform when subject to an electric field</span>
				<span class='text'>Almost all digital electronic circuits now rely on this  in the form of [[crystal oscillator]]s</span>

				<span class='text'>=Research==Prior to his famous doctoral studies on magnetism, he designed and perfected an extremely sensitive [[torsion balance]] for measuring magnetic coefficients</span>
				<span class='text'>Variations on this equipment were commonly used by future workers in that area</span>
				<span class='text'>Pierre Curie studied [[ferromagnetism]], [[paramagnetism]], and [[diamagnetism]] for his doctoral thesis, and discovered the effect of temperature on paramagnetism which is now known as [[Curie's law]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The material constant in Curie's law is known as the [[Curie constant]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also discovered that ferromagnetic substances exhibited a [[critical temperature]] transition, above which the substances lost their ferromagnetic behavior</span>
				<span class='text'>This is now known as the [[Curie point]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Curie Point is used to study plate tectonics, treat hypothermia, measure caffeine, and to understand extraterrestrial magnetic fields</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;Pierre formulated what is now known as the ''Curie Dissymmetry Principle'': a [[physical effect]] cannot have a dissymmetry absent from its efficient [[cause]]</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, a random mixture of sand in zero gravity has no [[dissymmetry]] (it is [[isotropic]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Introduce a [[gravitational field]], and there is a dissymmetry because of the direction of the field</span>
				<span class='text'>Then the sand grains can 'self-sort' with the density increasing with depth</span>
				<span class='text'>But this new arrangement, with the directional arrangement of sand grains, actually reflects the dissymmetry of the gravitational field that causes the separation</span>
				<span class='text'>ierre worked with [[Marie Curie|his wife]] in isolating [[polonium]] and [[radium]]</span>
				<span class='text'>They were the first to use the term &quot;[[radioactivity]]&quot;, and were pioneers in its study</span>
				<span class='text'>Their work, including Marie's celebrated doctoral work, made use of a sensitive piezoelectric [[electrometer]] constructed by Pierre and his brother Jacques</span>
				<span class='text'>ierre and one of his students made the first discovery of [[Nuclear binding energy|nuclear energy]], by identifying the continuous emission of heat from radium particles</span>
				<span class='text'>He also investigated the radiation emissions of radioactive substances, and through the use of magnetic fields was able to show that some of the emissions were positively charged, some were negative and some were neutral</span>
				<span class='text'>These correspond to [[alpha particle|alpha]], [[beta particle|beta]] and [[gamma radiation]]</span>
				<span class='text'>he [[curie]] is a unit of radioactivity (3</span>
				<span class='text'>&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; decays per second or 37 [[becquerel|gigabecquerels]]) originally named in honor of Curie by the Radiology Congress in 1910, after his death</span>
				<span class='text'>Subsequently, there has been some controversy over whether the naming was in honor of Pierre, Marie, or both</span>

				<span class='text'>Pierre Curie initially thought that systematic investigations into the paranormal would help him with some unanswered questions about magnetism (Hurwic 1995, p</span>

				<span class='text'>(Paris: Flammarion, 1995) p</span>
				<span class='text'>65&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote to his fiancée [[Marie Curie|Marie]], &quot;I must admit that those [[Spiritualism|spiritual]] phenomena intensely interest me</span>
				<span class='text'>I think in them are questions that deal with physics&quot; (Hurwic 1995, p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;66) Pierre Curie's notebooks from this period show he read many books on spiritualism</span>
				<span class='text'>(Hurwic 1995, p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;68)About some [[séance]]s with [[Eusapia Palladino]], Pierre Curie wrote to physicist Georges Gouy in a letter dated 24 July 1905 (Hurwic 1995, p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;248):{{blockquote|&quot;We had at the Psychology Society a few séances with the medium Eusapia Paladino</span>
				<span class='text'>It was very interesting, and truly those phenomena that we have witnessed seemed to us to not be some magical tricks—a table lifted four feet above the floor, movements of objects, feelings of hands that pinched you or caressed you, apparitions of light</span>
				<span class='text'>All this in a room arranged by us, with a small number of spectators all well known and without the presence of a possible accomplice</span>
				<span class='text'>Cheating would only be possible if the medium had extraordinary abilities as a magician</span>
				<span class='text'>But how to explain the different phenomena when we are holding her hands and legs, and the lighting of the room is sufficient to see everything going on?&quot;|}}Pierre did not go to séances as a mere spectator, and his goal certainly was not to communicate with some spirits</span>
				<span class='text'>He saw the séances as scientific experiments, tried to monitor different parameters, and took detailed notes of every observation</span>
