				<span class='text'>The nearby port of [[Lagos, Portugal|Lagos]] provided a convenient harbor from which these expeditions left</span>
				<span class='text'>The voyages were made in very small ships, mostly the [[caravel]], a light and maneuverable vessel</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Castro|Fonseca|Vacas|Ciciliot|2008|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the voyages sent out by Henry consisted of one or two ships that navigated by following the coast, stopping at night to tie up along some shore</span>
				<span class='text'>uring Prince Henry's time and after, the Portuguese navigators discovered and perfected the North Atlantic ''[[Volta do Mar]]'' (the &quot;turn of the sea&quot; or &quot;return from the sea&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>This was a major step in the [[history of navigation]], when an understanding of [[Winds in the Age of Sail|oceanic wind patterns]] was crucial to Atlantic navigation, from Africa and the open ocean to Europe, and enabling the main route between the [[New World]] and Europe in the North Atlantic, in future voyages of discovery</span>
				<span class='text'>Understanding the Atlantic gyre and the ''volta do mar'' enabled Portuguese mariners who sailed south and southwest towards the Canary Islands and West Africa to beat upwind to the Strait of Gibraltar and home</span>
				<span class='text'>To do this, they first had to sail far to the west — that is, away from continental [[Portugal]], and seemingly in the wrong direction</span>
				<span class='text'>They could then turn northeast, to the area around the Azores islands, and finally east to Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>This route would catch usable following winds</span>

				<span class='text'>They found shelter at an island they named [[Porto Santo Island|Porto Santo]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Henry directed that Porto Santo be colonized</span>

				<span class='text'>By this stage the explorers had passed the southern boundary of the desert, and from then on Henry had one of his wishes fulfilled: the Portuguese had circumvented the Muslim land-based trade routes across the western [[Sahara Desert]], and slaves and gold began arriving in Portugal</span>
				<span class='text'>By 1452, the influx of gold permitted the minting of Portugal's first gold ''[[cruzado]]'' coins</span>
