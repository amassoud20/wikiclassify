				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>including the designation &quot;famous&quot;, and the many imitations of ''Tamburlaine'' suggest that he was for a brief time considered England's foremost dramatist</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt; He greatly influenced [[William Shakespeare]], who was born in the same year as Marlowe and who rose to become the pre-eminent Elizabethan playwright after Marlowe's mysterious early death</span>
				<span class='text'>Marlowe's plays are known for the use of [[blank verse]] and their overreaching [[protagonist]]s</span>
				<span class='text'> warrant was issued for Marlowe's arrest on 18 May 1593</span>
				<span class='text'>No reason was given for it, though it was thought to be connected to allegations of blasphemy—a manuscript believed to have been written by Marlowe was said to contain &quot;vile heretical conceipts&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>On 20 May he was brought to the court to attend upon the [[Privy Council]] for questioning</span>
				<span class='text'>There is no record of their having met that day, however, and he was commanded to attend upon them each day thereafter until &quot;licensed to the contrary</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Ten days later, he was stabbed to death by [[Ingram Frizer]]</span>

				<span class='text'>His date of birth is not known, but he was baptised on 26 February 1564, and is likely to have been born a few days before</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus he was just two months older than his contemporary [[William Shakespeare]], who was baptised on 26 April 1564 in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]]</span>
				<span class='text'>arlowe attended [[The King's School, Canterbury|The King's School]] in Canterbury (where a house is now named after him) and [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], where he studied on a scholarship and received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1584</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=MRLW580C|name=Marlowe, Christopher}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1587 the university hesitated to award him his Master of Arts degree because of a rumour that he intended to go to the English college at [[Rheims]], presumably to prepare for ordination as a [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] priest</span>
				<span class='text'>However, his degree was awarded on schedule when the [[Privy Council of England|Privy Council]] intervened on his behalf, commending him for his &quot;faithful dealing&quot; and &quot;good service&quot; to [[Elizabeth I of England|the Queen]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The nature of Marlowe's service was not specified by the Council, but its letter to the Cambridge authorities has provoked much speculation, notably the theory that Marlowe was operating as a secret agent working for Sir [[Francis Walsingham]]'s intelligence service</span>

				<span class='text'>The play was first published in 1594; the title page attributes the play to Marlowe and [[Thomas Nashe]]</span>
				<span class='text'>arlowe's first play performed on the regular stage in London, in 1587, was ''[[Tamburlaine (play)|Tamburlaine the Great]]'', about the conqueror [[Timur|Tamburlaine]], who rises from shepherd to war-lord</span>

				<span class='text'>''Tamburlaine'' was a success, and was followed with ''Tamburlaine the Great, Part II''</span>
				<span class='text'>he two parts of ''Tamburlaine'' were published in 1590; all Marlowe's other works were published posthumously</span>
				<span class='text'>The sequence of the writing of his other four plays is unknown; all deal with controversial themes</span>
				<span class='text'> ''[[The Jew of Malta]]'' (first published as ''The Famous Tragedy of the Rich Jew of Malta''), about a Maltese Jew's barbarous revenge against the city authorities, has a prologue delivered by a character representing [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It was probably written in 1589 or 1590, and was first performed in 1592</span>
				<span class='text'>It was a success, and remained popular for the next fifty years</span>
				<span class='text'>The play was entered in the [[Stationers' Register]] on 17 May 1594, but the earliest surviving printed edition is from 1633</span>
				<span class='text'> ''[[Edward II (play)|Edward the Second]]'' is an English history play about the deposition of King [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] by his barons and the Queen, who resent the undue influence the king's favourites have in court and state affairs</span>
				<span class='text'>The play was entered into the Stationers' Register on 6 July 1593, five weeks after Marlowe's death</span>
				<span class='text'>The full title of the earliest extant edition, of 1594, is ''The troublesome reigne and lamentable death of Edward the second, King of England, with the tragicall fall of proud Mortimer</span>
				<span class='text'>'* ''[[The Massacre at Paris]]'' is a short and luridly written work, the only surviving text of which was probably a [[Memorial reconstruction|reconstruction from memory]] of the original performance text,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Deats|first=Sarah Munson|editor=Cheney, Patrick|title=The Cambridge Companion to Christopher Marlowe|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|year=2004|page=193|chapter='Dido Queen of Carthage' and 'The Massacre at Paris'|isbn=0-521-82034-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; portraying the events of the [[Saint Bartholomew's Day Massacre]] in 1572, which English Protestants invoked as the blackest example of Catholic treachery</span>
				<span class='text'>It features the silent &quot;English Agent&quot;, whom subsequent tradition has identified with Marlowe himself and his connections to the secret service</span>

				<span class='text'>207&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Massacre at Paris'' is considered his most dangerous play, as agitators in London seized on its theme to advocate the murders of refugees from the [[Spanish Netherlands|low countries]] and, indeed, it warns [[Elizabeth I]] of this possibility in its last scene</span>

				<span class='text'> ''[[Doctor Faustus (play)|Doctor Faustus]]'' (or ''The Tragicall History of the Life and Death of Doctor Faustus''),&lt;ref&gt;This was the title of the (B text) edition published in 1616</span>
				<span class='text'>The earlier (A text) edition of 1604 simply had ''The Tragicall History of D</span>
				<span class='text'>Faustus''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; based on the German [[Faustbuch]], was the first dramatised version of the [[Faust]] legend of a scholar's dealing with the devil</span>
				<span class='text'>While versions of &quot;The Devil's Pact&quot; can be traced back to the 4th century, Marlowe deviates significantly by having his hero unable to &quot;burn his books&quot; or repent to a merciful God in order to have his contract annulled at the end of the play</span>
				<span class='text'>Marlowe's protagonist is instead carried off by demons, and in the 1616 quarto his mangled corpse is found by several scholars</span>
				<span class='text'>Doctor Faustus is a textual problem for scholars as two versions of the play exist: the 1604 [[quarto]], also known as the A text, and the 1616 quarto or B text</span>
				<span class='text'>Both were published after Marlowe's death</span>
				<span class='text'>Scholars have disagreed which text is more representative of Marlowe's original, and some editions are based on a combination of the two</span>
				<span class='text'>The latest scholarly consensus (as of the late 20th century) holds the A text is more representative because it contains irregular character names and idiosyncratic spelling, which are believed to reflect a text based on the author's handwritten manuscript, or &quot;[[foul papers]]</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The B text, in comparison, was highly edited, censored because of shifting theatre laws regarding religious words onstage, and contains several additional scenes which scholars believe to be the additions of other playwrights, particularly [[Samuel Rowley]] and William Bird (''alias'' Borne)</span>
				<span class='text'>arlowe's plays were enormously successful, thanks in part, no doubt, to the imposing stage presence of [[Edward Alleyn]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Alleyn was unusually tall for the time, and the haughty roles of Tamburlaine, Faustus, and Barabas were probably written especially for him</span>
				<span class='text'>Marlowe's plays were the foundation of the repertoire of Alleyn's company, the [[Admiral's Men]], throughout the 1590s</span>
				<span class='text'>arlowe also wrote the poem ''[[Hero and Leander (poem)|Hero and Leander]]'' (published in 1598, and with a continuation by [[George Chapman]] the same year), the popular lyric &quot;[[The Passionate Shepherd to His Love]]&quot;, and translations of [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Amores (Ovid)|Amores]]'' and the first book of [[Lucan (poet)|Lucan]]'s ''[[Pharsalia]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1599, his translation of [[Ovid]] was banned and copies publicly burned as part of [[John Whitgift|Archbishop Whitgift]]'s crackdown on offensive material</span>
				<span class='text'>=Legend==As with other writers of the period, little is known about Marlowe</span>
				<span class='text'>What evidence there is can be found in legal records and other official documents</span>
				<span class='text'>This has not stopped writers of both fiction and non-fiction from speculating about his activities and character</span>
				<span class='text'>Marlowe has often been described as a spy, a brawler, and a heretic, as well as a &quot;magician&quot;, &quot;duellist&quot;, &quot;tobacco-user&quot;, &quot;counterfeiter&quot;, and &quot;[[Rake (character)|rakehell]]&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|200px|Title page of the earliest published text of ''[[Edward II (play)|Edward II]]'' (1594)]]Marlowe is often alleged to have been a government spy ([[Park Honan]]'s 2005 biography even had &quot;Spy&quot; in its title&lt;ref&gt;Park Honan, ''Christopher Marlowe: Poet and Spy'', 2005</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;) The author [[Charles Nicholl (author)|Charles Nicholl]] speculates this was the case and suggests that Marlowe's recruitment took place when he was at Cambridge</span>
				<span class='text'>As noted above, in 1587 the Privy Council ordered the University of Cambridge to award Marlowe his degree of Master of Arts, denying rumours that he intended to go to the English Catholic college in Rheims, saying instead that he had been engaged in unspecified &quot;affaires&quot; on &quot;matters touching the benefit of his country&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;This is from a document dated 29 June 1587, from the National Archives – ''Acts of Privy Council''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Surviving college records from the period also indicate that Marlowe had had a series of unusually lengthy absences from the university – much longer than permitted by university regulations – that began in the academic year 1584–1585</span>
				<span class='text'>Surviving college [[Buttery (shop)|buttery]] (provisions store) accounts indicate he began spending lavishly on food and drink during the periods he was in attendance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicholl|first=Charles|title=The Reckoning: The Murder of Christopher Marlowe|publisher=Jonathan Cape|location=London |year=1992|chapter=12|isbn=0-224-03100-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; – more than he could have afforded on his known scholarship income</span>
				<span class='text'>{refn|group=nb|It is known that some poorer students worked as labourers on the Corpus Christi College chapel, then under construction, and were paid by the college with extra food</span>
				<span class='text'>It has been suggested this may be the reason for the sums noted in Marlowe's entry in the buttery accounts</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;He was described by Arbella's guardian, the Countess of Shrewsbury, as having hoped for an annuity of some £40 from Arbella, his being &quot;so much damnified (i</span>

				<span class='text'>St John Brooks in 1937; in a letter to ''[[Notes and Queries]]'', John Baker has added that only Marlowe could be Arbella's tutor due to the absence of any other known &quot;Morley&quot; from the period with an MA and not otherwise occupied</span>

				<span class='text'> (1997), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>367–8&lt;/ref&gt; If Marlowe was Arbella's tutor, (and some biographers think that the &quot;Morley&quot; in question may have been a brother of the musician [[Thomas Morley]]&lt;ref&gt;Constance Kuriyama, ''Christopher Marlowe: A Renaissance Life'' (2002), p</span>

				<span class='text'>Also in Handover's biography of Arbella, and Nicholl, ''The Reckoning'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>342</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;) it might indicate that he was there as a spy, since Arbella, niece of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], and cousin of James VI of Scotland, later [[James I of England]], was at the time a strong candidate for the [[succession to Elizabeth's throne]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In fact the quarrel and his arrest was on 18 September, he was released on bail on 1 October, and he had to attend court – where he was cleared of any wrongdoing – on 3 December, but there is no record of where he was for the intervening two months</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In 1592 Marlowe was arrested in the town of [[Flushing, Netherlands|Flushing]] (Vlissingen) in the Netherlands for his alleged involvement in the [[Counterfeit money|counterfeiting]] of coins, presumably related to the activities of seditious Catholics</span>

				<span class='text'>All three had been employed by one or other of the Walsinghams</span>
				<span class='text'>Skeres and Poley had helped snare the conspirators in the [[Babington plot]] and Frizer would later describe Thomas Walsingham as his &quot;master&quot; at that time&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Hotson, ''The Death of Christopher Marlowe'' (1925) p</span>

				<span class='text'>25&lt;/ref&gt; These witnesses testified that Frizer and Marlowe had argued over payment of the bill (now famously known as the 'Reckoning') exchanging &quot;divers malicious words&quot; while Frizer was sitting at a table between the other two and Marlowe was lying behind him on a couch</span>
				<span class='text'>Marlowe snatched Frizer's dagger and wounded him on the head</span>
				<span class='text'>In the ensuing struggle, according to the coroner's report, Marlowe was stabbed above the right eye, killing him instantly</span>

				<span class='text'>Kittredge said &quot;The mystery of Marlowe's death, heretofore involved in a cloud of contradictory gossip and irresponsible guess-work, is now cleared up for good and all on the authority of public records of complete authenticity and gratifying fullness&quot;, but this confidence proved fairly short-lived</span>
				<span class='text'>otson himself had considered the possibility that the witnesses had &quot;concocted a lying account of Marlowe's behaviour, to which they swore at the inquest, and with which they deceived the jury&quot; but came down against that scenario</span>

				<span class='text'>&quot;The authenticity of the inquest is not in doubt, but whether it tells the full truth is another matter</span>
				<span class='text'>The nature of Marlowe's companions raises questions about their reliability as witnesses</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt; As an ''agent provocateur'' for the late Sir Francis Walsingham, Robert Poley was a consummate liar, the &quot;very genius of the Elizabethan underworld&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Boas (1953), p</span>

				<span class='text'>8&lt;/ref&gt; The other witness, Nicholas Skeres, had for many years acted as a confidence trickster, drawing young men into the clutches of people in the money-lending racket, including Marlowe's apparent killer, Ingram Frizer, with whom he was currently engaged in just such a swindle</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt; However, since there are only written documents on which to base any conclusions, and since it is probable that the most crucial information about his death was never committed to writing at all, it is unlikely that the full circumstances of Marlowe's death will ever be known</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;The most famous tribute to Marlowe was paid by [[Shakespeare]] in ''[[As You Like It]]'', where he not only quotes a line from ''[[Hero and Leander]]'' (&quot;Dead Shepherd, now I find thy saw of might, 'Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?{{'&quot;}}) but also gives to the clown [[Touchstone (As You Like It)|Touchstone]] the words &quot;When a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a man's good wit seconded with the forward child, understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; This appears to be a reference to Marlowe's murder which involved a fight over the &quot;reckoning&quot;, the bill, as well as to a line in Marlowe's ''Jew of Malta''{{spaced ndash}}&quot;Infinite riches in a little room&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>hakespeare was heavily influenced by Marlowe in his work, as can be seen in the re-using of Marlovian themes in ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'', ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'', and ''[[Macbeth]]'' (''Dido'', ''Jew of Malta'', ''Edward II'' and ''Dr Faustus'' respectively)</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''[[Hamlet]]'', after meeting with the travelling actors, Hamlet requests the Player perform a speech about the Trojan War, which at 2</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>29–32 has an echo of Marlowe's ''[[Dido, Queen of Carthage (play)|Dido, Queen of Carthage]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'' Shakespeare brings on a character &quot;Marcade&quot; (three syllables) in conscious acknowledgement of Marlowe's character &quot;Mercury&quot;, also attending the King of Navarre, in ''Massacre at Paris''</span>
				<span class='text'>The significance, to those of Shakespeare's audience who had read ''Hero and Leander'', was Marlowe's identification of himself with the god [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]</span>
