				<span class='text'> The nature of Marlowes service was not specified by the Council but its letter to the Cambridge authorities has provoked much speculation notably the theory that Marlowe was operating as a secret agent working for Sir s intelligence service</span>

				<span class='text'>Tamburlaine was a success and was followed with Tamburlaine the Great Part II</span>
				<span class='text'>he two parts of Tamburlaine were published in 1590 all Marlowes other works were published posthumously</span>
				<span class='text'>The sequence of the writing of his other four plays is unknown all deal with controversial themes</span>

				<span class='text'>It was probably written in 1589 or 1590 and was first performed in 1592</span>
				<span class='text'>It was a success and remained popular for the next fifty years</span>
				<span class='text'>The play was entered in the  on 17 May 1594 but the earliest surviving printed edition is from 1633</span>

				<span class='text'>The play was entered into the Stationers Register on 6 July 1593 five weeks after Marlowes death</span>
				<span class='text'>The full title of the earliest extant edition of 1594 is The troublesome reigne and lamentable death of Edward the second King of England with the tragicall fall of proud Mortimer</span>
				<span class='text'> is a short and luridly written work the only surviving text of which was probably a  of the original performance text  portraying the events of the  in 1572 which English Protestants invoked as the blackest example of Catholic treachery</span>

				<span class='text'>While versions of The Devils Pact can be traced back to the 4th century Marlowe deviates significantly by having his hero unable to burn his books or repent to a merciful God in order to have his contract annulled at the end of the play</span>
				<span class='text'>Marlowes protagonist is instead carried off by demons and in the 1616 quarto his mangled corpse is found by several scholars</span>
				<span class='text'>Doctor Faustus is a textual problem for scholars as two versions of the play exist the 1604  also known as the A text and the 1616 quarto or B text</span>
				<span class='text'>Both were published after Marlowes death</span>
				<span class='text'>Scholars have disagreed which text is more representative of Marlowes original and some editions are based on a combination of the two</span>
				<span class='text'>The latest scholarly consensus as of the late 20th century holds the A text is more representative because it contains irregular character names and idiosyncratic spelling which are believed to lect a text based on the authors handwritten manuscript or </span>
				<span class='text'>The B text in comparison was highly edited censored because of shifting theatre laws regarding religious words onstage and contains several additional scenes which scholars believe to be the additions of other playwrights particularly  and William Bird alias Borne</span>
				<span class='text'>arlowes plays were enormously successful thanks in part no doubt to the imposing stage presence of </span>
				<span class='text'>Alleyn was unusually tall for the time and the haughty roles of Tamburlaine Faustus and Barabas were probably written especially for him</span>
				<span class='text'>Marlowes plays were the foundation of the repertoire of Alleyns company the  throughout the 1590s</span>

				<span class='text'>This has not stopped writers of both fiction and non fiction from speculating about his activities and character</span>

				<span class='text'> The author  speculates this was the case and suggests that Marlowes recruitment took place when he was at Cambridge</span>
				<span class='text'>As noted above in 1587 the Privy Council ordered the University of Cambridge to award Marlowe his degree of Master of Arts denying rumours that he intended to go to the English Catholic college in Rheims saying instead that he had been engaged in unspecified affaires on matters touching the benefit of his country</span>
				<span class='text'>his is from a document dated 29 June 1587 from the National Archives â€“ Acts of Privy Council</span>
				<span class='text'> Surviving college records from the period also indicate that Marlowe had had a series of unusually lengthy absences from the university â€“ much longer than permitted by university regulations â€“ that began in the academic year 1584â€“1585</span>
				<span class='text'>Surviving college  provisions store accounts indicate he began spending lavishly on food and drink during the periods he was in attendance  â€“ more than he could have afforded on his known scholarship income</span>
				<span class='text'>t has sometimes been theorised that Marlowe was the Morley who was tutor to  in 1589</span>
