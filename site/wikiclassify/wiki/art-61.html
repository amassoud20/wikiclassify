				<span class='text'>The earlier date is sometimes assigned due to the maturity revealed in his two earliest treatises ''Contra Gentes'' (''Against the Heathens'') and ''De Incarnatione'' (''On the Incarnation''), which were admittedly written about the year 318 before Arianism had begun to make itself felt, as those writings do not show an awareness of Arianism</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Clifford1907&quot;/&gt; However Cornelius Clifford places his birth no earlier than 296 and no later than 298, based on the fact that Athanasius indicates no first hand recollection of the Maximian persecution of 303, which he suggests Athanasius would have remembered if he had been ten years old at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>Secondly, the ''Festal Epistles'' state that the Arians had accused Athanasius, among other charges, of not having yet attained the canonical age (30) and thus could not have been be properly ordination as Patriarch of Alexandria in 328</span>
				<span class='text'>The accusation must have seemed plausible</span>

				<span class='text'>He sent for the children and discovered that one of the boys (Athanasius) had acted as bishop</span>
				<span class='text'>After questioning Athanasius, Bishop Alexander informed him that the baptisms were genuine, as both the [[Sacramental matter and form|form and matter of the sacrament]] had been performed through the recitation of the correct words and the administration of water, and that he must not continue to do this as those baptized had not been properly [[Catechesis|catechized]]</span>

				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=April 2014}} This persecution was most severe in the East, particularly in Egypt and Palestine</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Pope Peter I of Alexandria|Peter of Alexandria]], the 17th archbishop of Alexandria, was martyred in 311 in the closing days of that persecution, and may have been one of those teachers</span>

				<span class='text'>According to [[Sozomen]], Bishop Alexander &quot;invited Athanasius to be his commensal and secretary</span>
				<span class='text'>He had been well educated, and was versed in grammar and rhetoric, and had already, while still a young man, and before reaching the episcopate, given proof to those who dwelt with him of his wisdom and acumen&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Clifford1907&quot;/&gt; Athanasius's earliest work, ''Against the Heathen – On the Incarnation'' (written before 319), bears traces of Origenist Alexandrian thought (such as repeatedly quoting [[Plato]] and used a definition from [[Aristotle]]'s ''Organon'') but in an orthodox way</span>
				<span class='text'>Athanasius was also familiar with the theories of various philosophical schools, and in particular with the developments of [[Neo-Platonism]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Ultimately, Athanasius would modify the philosophical thought of the School of Alexandria away from the Origenist principles such as the &quot;entirely allegorical interpretation of the text&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Still, in later works, Athanasius quotes [[Homer]] more than once (''Hist</span>

				<span class='text'>(Santiago de Compostela, 1990), 398&lt;/ref&gt; Arius's theological views appear to have been firmly rooted in Alexandrian Christianity, and his Christological views were certainly not radical at all</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Williams, Rowan, Arius: Heresy and Tradition (London: Darton, Longman and Todd, 1987),175&lt;/ref&gt; He embraced a subordinationist [[Christology]] which taught that Christ was the divine Son (''Logos'') of God, made, not begotten, heavily influenced by Alexandrian thinkers like [[Origen]],&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 175&lt;/ref&gt; and which was a common Christological view in Alexandria at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Williams 154–155&lt;/ref&gt; Support for Arius from powerful bishops like [[Eusebius of Caesarea]]&lt;ref&gt;Arius letter to Eusebius of Nicomedia&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Eusebius of Nicomedia]],&lt;ref&gt;Alexander of Alexandria's Catholic Epistle&lt;/ref&gt; further illustrate how Arius's subordinationist Christology was shared by other Christians in the Empire</span>

				<span class='text'>That council also denounced various heresies and schisms, many of which continued to preoccupy his 45-year-long episcopate (c</span>
				<span class='text'>8 June 328 – 2 May 373)</span>
				<span class='text'>Patriarch Athanasius spent over 17 years in five exiles ordered by four different Roman Emperors, not counting approximately six more incidents in which Athanasius fled Alexandria to escape people seeking to take his life</span>
				<span class='text'>This gave rise to the expression &quot;Athanasius contra mundum&quot; or &quot;Athanasius against the world&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>However, during his first years as bishop, Athanasius visited the churches of his territory, which at that time included all of [[Egypt]] and [[Libya]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He established contacts with the hermits and monks of the desert, including [[Pachomius]], which proved very valuable to him over the years</span>
				<span class='text'>Shortly thereafter, Athanasius became occupied with the theological disputes against [[Arianism|Arians]] within the [[Byzantine Empire]] that would occupy much of his life</span>

				<span class='text'>Accused of mistreating Arians and Meletians, Athanasius answered those charges at a gathering of bishops in [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], the [[First Synod of Tyre]], in 335</span>
				<span class='text'>There, [[Eusebius of Nicomedia]] and other supporters of Arius deposed Athanasius</span>

				<span class='text'>The Eusebians, seeing they had no chance of having their views carried, retired to Philoppopolis in Thrace, [[Philippopolis (Thracia)]], where they held an opposition council, under the presidency of the Patriarch of Antioch, and confirmed the decrees of the Synod of Antioch</span>

				<span class='text'>The persecution against the orthodox party broke out with renewed vigour, and Constantius was induced to prepare drastic measures against Athanasius and the priests who were devoted to him</span>

				<span class='text'>However, upon Constans's death in 350, another civil war broke out, which left pro-Arian Constantius as sole emperor</span>
				<span class='text'>An [[Councils of Alexandria#Council of 326|Alexandria local council]] in 350 replaced (or reaffirmed) Athanasius in his see</span>
				<span class='text'>ope Julius had died in April, 352, and was succeeded by [[Pope Liberius|Liberius]]</span>
				<span class='text'> For two years Liberius had been favourable to the cause of Athanasius; but driven at last into exile, he was induced to sign an ambiguous formula, from which the great Nicene text, the &quot;homoousion&quot;, had been studiously omitted</span>
				<span class='text'> In 355 a council was held at Milan, where in spite of the vigorous opposition of a handful of loyal prelates among the Western bishops, a fourth condemnation of Athanasius was announced to the world</span>
				<span class='text'> With his friends scattered, the saintly Hosius in exile, and Pope Liberius denounced as acquiescing in Arian formularies, Athanasius could hardly hope to escape</span>
				<span class='text'>On the night of 8 February, 356, while engaged in services in the Church of St</span>

				<span class='text'>1, Ch XVII: By Constantius's order, the sole ruler of  The Roman Empire at the death of his brother Constans,  the Council of [[Arles]] in 353, was held, which was presided over by Vincent, Bishop of [[Capua]], in the name of Pope Liberius</span>
				<span class='text'> The fathers terrified of the threats of the Emperor, an avowed Arian, they consented to the condemnation of Athanasius</span>
				<span class='text'> The Pope refused to accept their decision, and requested the Emperor to hold another Council, in which the charges against Athanasius could be freely investigated</span>
				<span class='text'> To this Constantius consented, for he felt able to control it, at Milan</span>
				<span class='text'> Milan was named as the place, here three hundred bishops assembled, most from the West, only a few from the East, in 355</span>
				<span class='text'> They met in the Church of Milan</span>
				<span class='text'> Shortly, the Emperor ordered them to a hall in the Imperial Palace, thus ending any free debate</span>
				<span class='text'>He presented an Arian formula of faith for their acceptance</span>
				<span class='text'>He threatened any who refused with exile and death</span>
				<span class='text'> All, with the exception of [[Dionysius (bishop of Milan)]], and the two Papal Legates, viz</span>
				<span class='text'> [[Eusebius of Vercelli]] and [[Lucifer of Cagliari]], consented to the Arian Creed and the condemnation of Athanasius</span>
				<span class='text'> Those who refused were sent into exile</span>
				<span class='text'>The decrees were forwarded to the Pope for approval, but were rejected, because of the violence to which the bishops were subjected</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;====Third exile====Through the influence of the Eusebian faction at Constantinople, an Arian bishop, [[George of Cappadocia]], was now appointed to rule the see of Alexandria</span>
				<span class='text'>Athanasius, after remaining some days in the neighbourhood of the city, finally withdrew into the desert of [[Upper Egypt]], where he remained for a period of six years, living the life of the monks, devoting himself to the composition of a group of writings; &quot;Apology to Constantius&quot;, the &quot;Apology for his Flight&quot;, the &quot;Letter to the Monks&quot;, and the &quot;History of the Arians&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Clifford1907&quot;/&gt;Constantius, renewing his previous policies favoring the Arians, banished Athanasius from Alexandria once again</span>
				<span class='text'>This was followed, in 356, by an attempt to arrest Athanasius during a vigil service</span>
				<span class='text'>Athanasius fled to [[Upper Egypt]], where he stayed in several monasteries and other houses</span>
				<span class='text'>During this period, Athanasius completed his work ''Four Orations against the Arians'' and defended his own recent conduct in the ''Apology to Constantius'' and ''Apology for His Flight''</span>
				<span class='text'>Constantius's persistence in his opposition to Athanasius, combined with reports Athanasius received about the persecution of non-Arians by the new Arian bishop [[George of Laodicea]], prompted Athanasius to write his more emotional ''History of the Arians'', in which he described Constantius as a precursor of the [[Antichrist]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;/&gt;Constantius, ordered Liberius into exile in 356 giving him, then, three days to comply</span>
				<span class='text'>He was ordered into banishment to Beroea, in Thrace; [[Beroea (Thrace)]]</span>
				<span class='text'> He sent expensive presents, too, if he were to accept the Arian position but were refused</span>
				<span class='text'>He sent him, indeed, five hundred pieces of gold &quot;to bear his charges&quot; but Liberius refused them, saying, he might bestow them on his flatters; as he did also a like present from the empress, bidding the messenger learn to believe in Christ, and not to persecute the Church of God</span>
				<span class='text'>Attempts were made to leave the presents in The Church, but Liberius threw them out</span>
				<span class='text'>Constantius hereupon sent for him under a strict guard to Milan, where, in a conference recorded by Theodoret, he boldly told Constantius that Athanasius had been acquitted at Sardica, and his enemies proved calumniators (see: &quot;calumny&quot;) and impostors, and that it was unjust to condemn a person who could not be legally convicted of any crime</span>
				<span class='text'>The emperor was reduced to silence on every article, but being the more out of patience, ordered him into banishment</span>
				<span class='text'>Liberius went into exile</span>
				<span class='text'> Constantius, after two years went to Rome to celebrate the twentieth year of his reign</span>
				<span class='text'> The ladies joined in a petition to him that he would restore Liberius</span>
				<span class='text'> He assented, upon condition that he should comply with the bishops, then, at court</span>
				<span class='text'> He subscribed the condemnation of Athanasius, and a confession or creed which had been framed  by the Arians at [[Sirmium]]</span>
				<span class='text'>And he no sooner had recovered his see that he declared himself for the [[Nicene Creed|Creed of Niceae]], as Theodoret testifies</span>

				<span class='text'>Gilmartin, (Professor of History, Maynooth, 1890), writes in Church History, Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>1, Ch XVII: The Arians sought the approval of an Ecumenical Council</span>
				<span class='text'>They sought to hold two councils</span>
				<span class='text'>Constantius, summoned the bishops of the East to meet at [[Seleucia in Isauria]], and those of the West to [[Rimini]] in Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>A preliminary conference was held by the Arians at [[Sirmium]], to agree a formula of faith</span>
				<span class='text'>A &quot;Homoeon&quot; creed was adopted, declaring The Son to be &quot;like the Father&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The two met in autumn of 359</span>
				<span class='text'>At Seleucia, one hundred and fifty bishops, of which one hundred and five were semi-Arian</span>
				<span class='text'>The semi-Arians refused to accept anything less than the &quot;Homoiousion&quot;, (see: [[Homoiousian]]), formulary of faith</span>
				<span class='text'>The Imperial Prefect was obliged to disband, without agreeing on any creed</span>
				<span class='text'>Acacius, the leader of the &quot;Homoean&quot; party went to Constantinople, where the Sirmian formulary of faith was approved by the &quot;Home Synod&quot;, (consisted of those bishops who happened to be present at the Court for the time), and a decree of deposition issued against the leaders of the semi-Arians</span>
				<span class='text'>At Rimini were over four hundred of which eighty were Arian, the rest were orthodox</span>
				<span class='text'>The orthodox fathers refused to accept any creed but the Nicene, while the others were equally in favour of the Sirmian</span>
				<span class='text'>Each party sent a deputation to the Emperor to say there was no probability to agreement, and asked for the bishops to return to their dioceses</span>
				<span class='text'>For the purpose of wearing-down the orthodox bishops; (Sulpitius Severius says), Constantius delayed his answer for several months, and finally prevailed on them to accept the Sirmian creed</span>
				<span class='text'>It was after this Council that [[Jerome]] said: &quot; </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>he whole world groaned in astonishment to find itself Arian</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;In 361, after the death of Emperor Constantius, shortly followed by the murder of the very unpopular Bishop George, Athanasius returned to his [[patriarchate]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The following year he convened a council at Alexandria, and presided over it with [[Eusebius of Vercelli]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Athanasius appealed for unity among all those who had faith in Christianity, even if they differed on matters of terminology</span>
				<span class='text'>This prepared the groundwork for his definition of the orthodox doctrine of the [[Trinity]]</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the council also was directed against those who denied the divinity of the Holy Spirit, the human soul of Christ, and Christ's divinity</span>
				<span class='text'>Mild measures were agreed on for those heretic bishops who repented, but severe penance was decreed for the chief leaders of the major heresies</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Councils of Alexandria}}&lt;/ref&gt;The Arians no longer presented an unbroken front to their orthodox opponents</span>
				<span class='text'> The Emperor Constantius, who had been the cause of so much trouble, died 4 November, 361 and was succeeded by [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]]</span>
				<span class='text'> The proclamation of the new prince's accession was the signal for a pagan outbreak against the still dominant Arian faction in Alexandria</span>
				<span class='text'> George, the usurping Bishop, was flung into prison and murdered</span>
				<span class='text'> An obscure presbyter of the name of Pistus was immediately chosen by the Arians to succeed him, when fresh news arrived that filled the orthodox party with hope</span>
				<span class='text'> An edict had been put forth by Julian permitting the exiled bishops of the &quot;Galileans&quot; to return to their &quot;towns and provinces&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'> Athanasius received a summons from his own flock, and he accordingly re-entered his episcopal capitol on 22 February, 362</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Clifford1907&quot;/&gt;With characteristic energy he set to work to re-establish the somewhat shattered fortunes of the orthodox party and to purge the theological atmosphere of uncertainty</span>
				<span class='text'> To clear up the misunderstandings that had arisen in the course of the previous years, an attempt was made to determine still further the significance of the Nicene formularies</span>
				<span class='text'>In the meanwhile, Julian, who seems to have become suddenly jealous of the influence that Athanasius was exercising at Alexandria, addressed an order to Ecdicius, the Prefect of Egypt, peremptorily commanding the expulsion of the restored primate, on the ground that he had never been included in the imperial act of clemency</span>
				<span class='text'>The edict was communicated to the bishop by Pythicodorus Trico, who, though described in the &quot;Chronicon Athanasianum&quot; (XXXV) as a &quot;philosopher&quot;, seems to have behaved with brutal insolence</span>
				<span class='text'>On 23 October the people gathered about the proscribed bishop to protest against the emperor's decree; but Athanasius urged them to submit, consoling them with the promise that his absence would be of short duration</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Clifford1907&quot;/&gt;====Fourth exile====In 362, the new Emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]], noted for his opposition to Christianity, ordered Athanasius to leave Alexandria once again</span>
				<span class='text'>Athanasius left for [[Upper Egypt]], remaining there with the [[Desert Fathers]] until Julian's death in 363</span>
				<span class='text'>Julian terminated his brief career 26 June, 363; and Athanasius returned in secret to Alexandria, where he soon received a document from the new emperor, [[Jovian (emperor)|Jovian]], reinstating him once more in his episcopal functions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Clifford1907&quot;/&gt;His first act was to convene a council which reaffirmed the terms of the [[Nicene Creed]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Early in September 363 he set out for [[Antioch on the Orontes]], bearing a synodal letter, in which the pronouncements of this council had been embodied</span>
				<span class='text'> At Antioch he had an interview with the new emperor, who received him graciously and even asked him to prepare an exposition of the orthodox faith</span>
				<span class='text'> But in the following February Jovian died; and in October, 364, Athanasius was once more an exile</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Clifford1907&quot;/&gt;====Fifth exile====Two years later, the Emperor [[Valens]], who favored the Arian position, in his turn exiled Athanasius</span>
				<span class='text'>This time however, Athanasius simply left for the outskirts of Alexandria, where he stayed for only a few months before the local authorities convinced Valens to retract his order of exile</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;/&gt; Some early reports state that Athanasius spent this period of exile at his family's ancestral tomb&lt;ref name=&quot;EA&quot;/&gt; in a Christian cemetery</span>
				<span class='text'>It was during this period, the final exile, that he is said to have spent four months in hiding in his father's tomb</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Clifford1907&quot;/&gt;The accession of Valens gave a fresh lease of life to the Arian party</span>
				<span class='text'> He issued a decree banishing the bishops who had been deposed by Constantius, but who had been permitted by Jovian to return to their sees</span>
				<span class='text'> The news created the greatest consternation in the city of Alexandria itself, and the prefect, in order to prevent a serious outbreak, gave public assurance that the very special case of Athanasius would be laid before the emperor</span>
				<span class='text'> But the saint seems to have divined what was preparing in secret against him</span>
				<span class='text'> He quietly withdrew from Alexandria, 5 October, and took up his abode in a country house outside the city</span>
				<span class='text'>Valens, who seems to have sincerely dreaded the possible consequences of another popular outbreak, within a few weeks issued orders allowing Athanasius to return to his [[episcopal see]]</span>

				<span class='text'>He resumed writing and preaching undisturbed, and characteristically re-emphasized the view of the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] which had been defined at [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicaea]]</span>
				<span class='text'>On 2 May 373, having consecrated [[Pope Peter II of Alexandria|Peter II]], one of his presbyters as his successor, Athanasius died quietly in his own bed, surrounded by his clergy and faithful supporters</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|200px|Statue of the saint in St Athanasius's [[Roman Catholic Church]] in [[Evanston, Illinois]]]]Athanasius has always been a controversial, if not divisive, figure</span>
				<span class='text'>While some scholars praise him as an orthodox saint with great character, others see him as a power-hungry politician who employed questionable ecclesiastical tactics</span>

				<span class='text'>This Gospel in itself is the greatest support of Athanasius's stand</span>

				<span class='text'> The Last Gospel of The Mass, The Eucharist, St John{{bibleref2c-nb|John|1:1–14}}, together with the prayer; &quot;Placeat tibi&quot;, the Blessing, are all private devotions that have been gradually absorbed by the liturgical service</span>
				<span class='text'> The beginning of John's Gospel was much used as an object of special devotion throughout the Middle Ages</span>
