				<span class='text'>The earlier date is sometimes assigned due to the maturity revealed in his two earliest treatises Contra Gentes Against the Heathens and De Incarnatione On the Incarnation which were admittedly written about the year 318 before Arianism had begun to make itself felt as those writings do not show an awareness of Arianism</span>
				<span class='text'>name Clifford1907  However Cornelius Clifford places his birth no earlier than 296 and no later than 298 based on the fact that Athanasius indicates no first hand recollection of the Maximian persecution of 303 which he suggests Athanasius would have remembered if he had been ten years old at the time</span>
