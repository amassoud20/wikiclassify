				<span class='text'>avid later became an active supporter of the [[French Revolution]] and friend of [[Maximilien Robespierre]] (1758–1794), and was effectively a dictator of the arts under the [[French First Republic|French Republic]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Imprisoned after Robespierre's fall from power, he aligned himself with yet another political regime upon his release: that of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], The First Consul of France</span>
				<span class='text'>At this time he developed his [[Empire style]], notable for its use of warm [[Venetian school (art)|Venetian]] colours</span>
				<span class='text'>After Napoleon's fall from Imperial power and the Bourbon revival, David exiled himself to [[Brussels]], then in the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]], where he remained until his death</span>
				<span class='text'>David had [[:Category:Pupils of Jacques-Louis David|a large number of pupils]], making him the strongest influence in French art of the early 19th century, especially academic [[Paris Salon|Salon]] painting</span>
				<span class='text'>=Early life==Jacques-Louis David was born into a prosperous family in Paris on 30 August 1748</span>
				<span class='text'>When he was about nine his father was killed in a duel and his mother left him with his well-off architect uncles</span>
				<span class='text'>They saw to it that he received an excellent education at the [[Collège des Quatre-Nations]], [[University of Paris]], but he was never a good student: he had a facial tumor that impeded his speech, and he was always preoccupied with drawing</span>
				<span class='text'>He covered his notebooks with drawings, and he once said, &quot;I was always hiding behind the instructor's chair, drawing for the duration of the class&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon, he desired to be a painter, but his uncles and mother wanted him to be an architect</span>
				<span class='text'>He overcame the opposition, and went to learn from [[François Boucher]] (1703–1770), the leading painter of the time, who was also a distant relative</span>
				<span class='text'>Boucher was a [[Rococo]] painter, but tastes were changing, and the fashion for Rococo was giving way to a more classical style</span>
				<span class='text'>Boucher decided that instead of taking over David's tutelage, he would send David to his friend [[Joseph-Marie Vien]] (1716–1809), a painter who embraced the classical reaction to Rococo</span>
				<span class='text'>There David attended the [[Académie de peinture et de sculpture|Royal Academy]], based in what is now the [[Louvre]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Mademoiselle Guimard as Terpsichore, by Jacques-Louis David</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumbnail|upright|''Mademoiselle Guimard as Terpsichore'', 1774–5, an early work]]Each year the Academy awarded an outstanding student the prestigious [[Prix de Rome]], which funded a three- to five-year stay in the Eternal City</span>
				<span class='text'>The culmination of the Academy's educational program, the Rome trip provided its winners the opportunity to study the remains of classical antiquity and the works of the Italian Renaissance masters at first hand</span>
				<span class='text'>Each ''pensionnaire'' was lodged in the French Academy's Roman outpost, which from the years 1737 to 1793 was the Palazzo Mancini in the Via del Corso</span>
				<span class='text'>David competed for, and failed to win, the prize for three consecutive years (with ''[[Minerva Fighting Mars]]'', ''[[Diana and Apollo Killing Niobe's Children]]'' and ''[[The Death of Seneca (David)|The Death of Seneca]]''), each failure contributing to his lifelong grudge against the institution</span>
				<span class='text'> After his second loss in 1772, David went on a hunger strike, which lasted two and a half days before the faculty encouraged him to continue painting</span>
				<span class='text'>Confident he now had the support and backing needed to win the prize, he resumed his studies with great zeal—only to fail to win the Prix de Rome again the following year</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally, in 1774, David was awarded the Prix de Rome on the strength of his painting of ''[[Erasistratus Discovering the Cause of Antiochus' Disease]]'', a subject set by the judges</span>
				<span class='text'>In October 1775 he made the journey to Italy with his mentor, Joseph-Marie Vien, who had just been appointed director of the [[French Academy in Rome|French Academy at Rome]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford&quot;/&gt;While in Italy, David especially studied the works of 17th-century masters such as [[Nicolas Poussin|Poussin]], [[Caravaggio]], and [[the Carracci]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford&quot;/&gt; Although he declared, &quot;the Antique will not seduce me, it lacks animation, it does not move&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford&quot;/&gt; David filled twelve sketchbooks with drawings that he and his studio used as model books for the rest of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>He was introduced to the painter [[Raphael Mengs]] (1728–1779), who opposed the tendency in Rococo painting to sweeten and trivialize ancient subjects, advocating instead the rigorous study of classical sources and close adherence to ancient models</span>
				<span class='text'>Mengs' principled, historicizing approach to the representation of classical subjects profoundly influenced David's pre-revolutionary painting, such as ''[[The Vestal Virgin (David)|The Vestal Virgin]]'', probably from the 1780s</span>
				<span class='text'>Mengs also introduced David to the theoretical writings on ancient sculpture by [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] (1717–1768), the German scholar held to be the founder of modern art history</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Alex Potts, ''Flesh and the Ideal: Winckelmann and the Origins of Art History'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2000)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In 1779, David toured the newly excavated ruins of [[Pompeii]], which deepened his belief that the persistence of classical culture was an index of its eternal conceptual and formal power</span>
				<span class='text'>While in Rome, David also assiduously studied the High Renaissance painters, Raphael making a profound and lasting impression on the young French artist</span>
				<span class='text'>=Early work==[[File:Jacques-Louis David - Equestrian portrait of Stanisław Kostka Potocki - Google Art Project</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|left|thumb|upright|''[[Portrait of count Stanislas Potocki|Equestrian portrait of Stanisław Kostka Potocki]]'' (1781)]]David's fellow students at the academy found him difficult to get along with, but they recognized his genius</span>
				<span class='text'>David's stay at the French Academy in Rome was extended by a year, but in July 1780 he returned to Paris</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford&quot;/&gt; There, he found people ready to use their influence for him, and he was made a member of the Royal Academy</span>
				<span class='text'>He sent the Academy two paintings, and both were included in the [[Paris Salon|Salon]] of 1781, a high honor</span>
				<span class='text'>He was praised by his famous contemporary painters, but the administration of the Royal Academy was very hostile to this young upstart</span>
				<span class='text'>After the Salon, the King granted David lodging in the Louvre, an ancient and much desired privilege of great artists</span>
				<span class='text'>When the contractor of the King's buildings, M</span>
				<span class='text'>Pécoul, was arranging with David, he asked the artist to marry his daughter, Marguerite Charlotte</span>
				<span class='text'>This marriage brought him money and eventually four children</span>
				<span class='text'>David had his own pupils, about 40 to 50, and was commissioned by the government to paint &quot;Horace defended by his Father&quot;, but he soon decided, &quot;Only in Rome can I paint Romans</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; His father-in-law provided the money he needed for the trip, and David headed for Rome with his wife and three of his students, one of whom, [[Jean-Germain Drouais]] (1763–1788), was the Prix de Rome winner of that year</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Jacques-Louis David - Oath of the Horatii - Google Art Project</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|''[[Oath of the Horatii]]'' (from 1786)]]In Rome, David painted his famous ''[[Oath of the Horatii]]'', 1784</span>
				<span class='text'>In this piece, the artist references [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] values while alluding to [[Rousseau]]'s social contract</span>
				<span class='text'>The republican ideal of the general will becomes the focus of the painting with all three sons positioned in compliance with the father</span>
				<span class='text'>The Oath between the characters can be read as an act of unification of men to the binding of the state</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boime|1987|p=394}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The issue of gender roles also becomes apparent in this piece, as the women in Horatii greatly contrast the group of brothers</span>
				<span class='text'>David depicts the father with his back to the women, shutting them out of the oath making ritual; they also appear to be smaller in scale than the male figures</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boime|1987|p=399}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  The masculine virility and discipline displayed by the men's rigid and confident stances is also severely contrasted to the slouching, swooning female softness created in the other half of the composition</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boime|1987|p=398}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Here we see the clear division of male-female attributes that confined the sexes to specific roles under Rousseau's popularized doctrine of &quot;separate spheres&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>hese revolutionary ideals are also apparent in the ''[[Distribution of Eagles]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>While ''Oath of the Horatii'' and ''[[The Tennis Court Oath (David)|The Tennis Court Oath]]'' stress the importance of masculine self-sacrifice for one's country and patriotism, the ''Distribution of Eagles'' would ask for self-sacrifice for one's Emperor ([[Napoleon]]) and the importance of battlefield glory</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:David - The Death of Socrates</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|''[[The Death of Socrates]]'' (1787)]]In 1787, David did not become the Director of the French Academy in Rome, which was a position he wanted dearly</span>
				<span class='text'>The Count in charge of the appointments said David was too young, but said he would support him in 6 to 12 years</span>
				<span class='text'>This situation would be one of many that would cause him to lash out at the Academy in years to come</span>
				<span class='text'>or the Salon of 1787, David exhibited his famous ''[[The Death of Socrates|Death of Socrates]]''</span>
				<span class='text'> &quot;Condemned to death, Socrates, strong, calm and at peace, discusses the immortality of the soul</span>
				<span class='text'>Surrounded by Crito, his grieving friends and students, he is teaching, philosophizing, and in fact, thanking the God of Health, Asclepius, for the [[Conium|hemlock]] brew which will ensure a peaceful death</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>The wife of Socrates can be seen grieving alone outside the chamber, dismissed for her weakness</span>
				<span class='text'>Plato is depicted as an old man seated at the end of the bed</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Critics compared the Socrates with [[Michelangelo]]'s [[Sistine Chapel|Sistine Ceiling]] and Raphael's Stanze, and one, after ten visits to the Salon, described it as &quot;in every sense perfect&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Denis Diderot]] said it looked like he copied it from some ancient [[bas-relief]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The painting was very much in tune with the political climate at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>For this painting, David was not honored by a royal &quot;works of encouragement&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:David Brutus</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|''[[The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons]]'' (1789)]]For his next painting, David created ''[[The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The work had tremendous appeal for the time</span>
				<span class='text'>Before the opening of the Salon, the [[French Revolution]] had begun</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] had been established, and the [[Bastille]] had fallen</span>
				<span class='text'>The royal court did not want propaganda agitating the people, so all paintings had to be checked before being hung</span>
				<span class='text'>David's [[Portrait of Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier and his wife|portrait of Lavoisier]], who was a chemist and physicist as well as an active member of the Jacobin party, was banned by the authorities for such reasons</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Honour|1977|p=72}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; When the newspapers reported that the government had not allowed the showing of ''The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons'', the people were outraged, and the royals were forced to give in</span>
				<span class='text'>The painting was hung in the exhibition, protected by art students</span>
				<span class='text'>The painting depicts [[Lucius Junius Brutus]], the Roman leader, grieving for his sons</span>
				<span class='text'>Brutus's sons had attempted to overthrow the government and restore the monarchy, so the father ordered their death to maintain the republic</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, Brutus was the heroic defender of the republic, at the cost of his own family</span>
				<span class='text'>On the right, the Mother holds her two daughters, and the nurse is seen on the far right, in anguish</span>
				<span class='text'>Brutus sits on the left, alone, brooding, seemingly dismissing the dead bodies of his sons</span>
				<span class='text'>Knowing what he did was best for his country, but the tense posture of his feet and toes reveals his inner turmoil</span>
				<span class='text'>The whole painting was a Republican symbol, and obviously had immense meaning during these times in France</span>
				<span class='text'>=The French Revolution==In the beginning, David was a supporter of the Revolution, a friend of [[Robespierre]] and a member of the [[Jacobin Club]]</span>
				<span class='text'>While others were leaving the country for new and greater opportunities, David stayed to help destroy the old order; he was a regicide who voted in the National Convention for the Execution of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It is uncertain why he did this,{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} as there were many more opportunities for him under the King than the new order; some people suggest David's love for the classical made him embrace everything about that period, including a republican government</span>
				<span class='text'>Others believed that they found the key to the artist's revolutionary career in his personality</span>
				<span class='text'>Undoubtedly, David's artistic sensibility, mercurial temperament, volatile emotions, ardent enthusiasm, and fierce independence might have been expected to help turn him against the established order but they did not fully explain his devotion to the republican regime</span>
				<span class='text'>Nor did the vague statements of those who insisted upon his &quot;powerful ambition</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>nd unusual energy of will&quot; actually account for his revolutionary connections</span>
				<span class='text'>Those who knew him maintained that &quot;generous ardor&quot;, high-minded idealism and well-meaning though sometimes fanatical enthusiasm, rather than opportunism and jealousy, motivated his activities during this period</span>
				<span class='text'>oon, David turned his critical sights on the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture</span>
				<span class='text'>This attack was probably caused primarily by the hypocrisy of the organization and their personal opposition against his work, as seen in previous episodes in David's life</span>
				<span class='text'>The Royal Academy was chock full of royalists, and David's attempt to reform it did not go over well with the members</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the deck was stacked against this symbol of the old regime, and the National Assembly ordered it to make changes to conform to the new constitution</span>
				<span class='text'>avid then began work on something that would later hound him: propaganda for the new republic</span>
				<span class='text'>David's painting of Brutus was shown during the play ''Brutus'', by the famous Frenchman, [[Voltaire]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The people responded in an uproar of approval</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1789, Jacques-Louis David attempted to leave his artistic mark on the historical beginnings of the French Revolution with his painting of ''[[Tennis Court Oath|The Oath of the Tennis Court]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>David undertook this task not out of personal political conviction but rather because he was commissioned to do so</span>
				<span class='text'>The painting was meant to commemorate the event of the same name but was never completed</span>
				<span class='text'>A meeting of the Estates General was convened in May to address reforms of the monarchy</span>
				<span class='text'>Dissent arose over whether the three estates would meet separately, as had been tradition, or as one body</span>
				<span class='text'>The King's acquiescence with the demands of the upper orders led to the deputies of the Third Estate renaming themselves as the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] on 17 June</span>
				<span class='text'>They were locked out of the meeting hall three days later when they attempted to meet, and forced to reconvene to the royal indoor tennis court</span>
				<span class='text'>Presided over by Jean-Sylvain Bailly, they made a 'solemn oath never to separate' until a national constitution had been created</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1789 this event was seen as a symbol of the national unity against the ''[[Ancien Régime|ancien regime]]''</span>
				<span class='text'> David was enlisted by the Society of Friends of the Constitution, the body that would eventually form the Jacobins, to enshrine this symbolic event</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Crow 2007&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Crow|2007}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;This instance is notable in more ways than one because it eventually led David to finally become involved in politics as he joined the Jacobins</span>
				<span class='text'>The picture was meant to be massive in scale; the figures in the foreground were to be life-sized portraits of the counterparts, including [[Jean-Sylvain Bailly]], the President of the Constituent Assembly</span>
				<span class='text'>Seeking additional funding, David turned to the Society of Friends of the Constitution</span>
				<span class='text'>The funding for the project was to come from over three thousand subscribers hoping to receive a print of the image</span>
				<span class='text'>However, when the funding was insufficient, the state ended up financing the project</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;David set out in 1790 to transform the contemporary event into a major historical picture which would appear at the Salon of 1791 as a large pen and ink drawing</span>
				<span class='text'>As in the ''Oath of the Horatii'', David represents the unity of men in the service of a patriotic ideal</span>
				<span class='text'>The outstretched arms which are prominent in both works betray David's deeply held belief that acts of republican virtue akin to those of the Romans were being played out in France</span>
				<span class='text'>In what was essentially an act of intellect and reason, David creates an air of drama in this work</span>
				<span class='text'>The very power of the people appears to be &quot;blowing&quot; through the scene with the stormy weather, in a sense alluding to the storm that would be the revolution</span>
				<span class='text'>ymbolism in this work of art closely represents the revolutionary events taking place at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>The figure in the middle is raising his right arm making the oath that they will never disband until they have reached their goal of creating a &quot;constitution of the realm fixed upon solid foundations</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bordes|2005|p=??}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The importance of this symbol is highlighted by the fact that the crowd's arms are angled to his hand forming a triangular shape</span>
				<span class='text'>Additionally, the open space in the top half contrasted to the commotion in the lower half serves to emphasize the magnitude of the [[Tennis Court Oath]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Le Serment du Jeu de paume</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|Drawing by Jacques-Louis David of the Tennis Court Oath</span>
				<span class='text'>David later became a deputy in the [[National Convention]] in 1792 ]]In his attempt to depict political events of the Revolution in &quot;real time&quot;, David was venturing down a new and untrodden path in the art world</span>
				<span class='text'>However, [[Thomas E</span>
				<span class='text'>Crow|Thomas Crow]] argues that this path &quot;proved to be less a way forward than a cul-de-sac for history painting</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Crow 2007&quot;/&gt;   Essentially, the history of the demise of David's &quot;The Tennis Court Oath&quot; illustrates the difficulty of creating works of art that portray current and controversial political occurrences</span>
				<span class='text'> Political circumstances in France proved too volatile to allow the completion of the painting</span>
				<span class='text'>The unity that was to be symbolized in &quot;The Tennis Court Oath&quot; no longer existed in radicalized 1792</span>
				<span class='text'> The National Assembly had split between conservatives and radical Jacobins, both vying for political power</span>
				<span class='text'> By 1792 there was no longer consensus that all the revolutionaries at the tennis court were &quot;heroes&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'> A sizeable number of the heroes of 1789 had become the villains of 1792</span>
				<span class='text'>In this unstable political climate David's work remained unfinished</span>
				<span class='text'>With only a few nude figures sketched onto the massive canvas, David abandoned &quot;The Oath of the Tennis Court&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>To have completed it would have been politically unsound</span>
				<span class='text'>After this incident, when David attempted to make a political statement in his paintings, he returned to the less politically charged use of metaphor to convey his message</span>
				<span class='text'>hen Voltaire died in 1778, the church denied him a church burial, and his body was interred near a monastery</span>
				<span class='text'>A year later, Voltaire's old friends began a campaign to have his body buried in the [[Panthéon, Paris|Panthéon]], as church property had been confiscated by the French Government</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1791 David was appointed to head the organizing committee for the ceremony, a parade through the streets of Paris to the Panthéon</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite rain, and opposition from conservatives based on the amount of money that was being spent, the procession went ahead</span>
				<span class='text'>Up to 100,000 people watched the &quot;Father of the Revolution&quot; be carried to his resting place</span>
				<span class='text'>This was the first of many large festivals organized by David for the republic</span>
				<span class='text'>He went on to organize festivals for martyrs that died fighting royalists</span>
				<span class='text'>These funerals echoed the religious festivals of the pagan Greeks and Romans and are seen by many as Saturnalian</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Le représentant du peuple François en fonction2</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|right|thumb|Republican costume designed by David</span>
				<span class='text'>Engraving by [[Dominique Vivant|Denon]]</span>
				<span class='text'>]David incorporated many revolutionary symbols into these theatrical performances and orchestrated ceremonial rituals; in effect radicalizing the applied arts, themselves</span>
				<span class='text'>The most popular symbol for which David was responsible as propaganda minister was drawn from classical Greek images; changing and transforming them with contemporary politics</span>
				<span class='text'>In an elaborate festival held on the anniversary of the revolt that brought the monarchy to its knees, David's Hercules figure was revealed in a procession following the lady Liberty (Marianne)</span>
				<span class='text'>Liberty, the symbol of Enlightenment ideals was here being overturned by the Hercules symbol; that of strength and passion for the protection of the Republic against disunity and factionalism</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hunt|2004|p=97}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In his speech during the procession, David &quot;explicitly emphasized the opposition between people and monarchy; Hercules was chosen, after all, to make this opposition more evident&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hunt|2004|p=99}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The ideals that David linked to his Hercules single-handedly transformed the figure from a sign of the old regime into a powerful new symbol of revolution</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;David turned him into the representation of a collective, popular power</span>
				<span class='text'>He took one of the favorite signs of monarchy and reproduced, elevated, and monumentalized it into the sign of its opposite</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hunt|2004|p=103}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Hercules, the image, became to the revolutionaries, something to rally around</span>
				<span class='text'>n June 1791, the King made an ill-fated attempt to flee the country ([[flight to Varennes]]), but was apprehended short of his goal on the Austrian Belgian border and was forced to return under guard to Paris</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis XVI had made secret requests to Emperor Joseph II of Austria, Marie-Antoinette's brother, to restore him to his throne</span>
				<span class='text'>This was granted and Austria threatened France if the royal couple were hurt</span>
				<span class='text'>In reaction, the people arrested the King</span>
				<span class='text'>This led to an Invasion after the trials and execution of Louis and Marie-Antoinette</span>
				<span class='text'>The Bourbon monarchy was destroyed by the French people in 1792—it would be restored after Napoleon, then destroyed again with the Restoration of the House of Bonaparte</span>
				<span class='text'>When the new National Convention held its first meeting, David was sitting with his friends [[Jean-Paul Marat]] and Robespierre</span>
				<span class='text'>In the Convention, David soon earned a nickname &quot;ferocious terrorist&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon, Robespierre's agents discovered a secret vault of the king's proving he was trying to overthrow the government, and demanded his execution</span>
				<span class='text'>The National Convention held the trial of Louis XVI and David voted for the death of the King, causing his wife, a royalist, to divorce him</span>
				<span class='text'>hen Louis XVI was executed on 21 January 1793, another man had already died as well—[[Louis Michel le Peletier de Saint-Fargeau]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Le Peletier was killed on the preceding day by a royal bodyguard in revenge for having voted for the death of the King</span>
				<span class='text'>David was called upon to organize a funeral, and he painted ''Le Peletier Assassinated''</span>
				<span class='text'> In it, the assassin's sword was seen hanging by a single strand of horsehair above Le Peletier's body, a concept inspired by the proverbial ancient tale of the sword of Damocles, which illustrated the insecurity of power and position</span>
				<span class='text'>This underscored the courage displayed by Le Peletier and his companions in routing an oppressive king</span>
				<span class='text'>The sword pierces a piece of paper on which is written &quot;I vote the death of the tyrant&quot;, and as a tribute at the bottom right of the picture David placed the inscription &quot;David to Le Peletier</span>
				<span class='text'>20 January 1793&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The painting was later destroyed by Le Peletier's royalist daughter, and is known by only a drawing, an engraving, and contemporary accounts</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, this work was important in David's career because it was the first completed painting of the French Revolution, made in less than three months, and a work through which he initiated the regeneration process that would continue with [[The Death of Marat]], David's masterpiece</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Jacques-Louis David - Marat assassinated - Google Art Project</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|left|thumb|'' [[The Death of Marat]]'' (1793)]]On 13 July 1793, David's friend Marat was assassinated by [[Charlotte Corday]] with a knife she had hidden in her clothing</span>
				<span class='text'>She gained entrance to Marat's house on the pretense of presenting him a list of people who should be executed as enemies of France</span>
				<span class='text'>Marat thanked her and said that they would be guillotined next week upon which Corday immediately fatally stabbed him</span>
				<span class='text'>She was guillotined shortly thereafter</span>
				<span class='text'>Corday was of an opposing political party, whose name can be seen in the note Marat holds in David's subsequent painting, ''[[The Death of Marat]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Marat, a member of the National Convention and a journalist, had a skin disease that caused him to itch horribly</span>
				<span class='text'>The only relief he could get was in his bath over which he improvised a desk to write his list of suspect counter-revolutionaries who were to be quickly tried and, if convicted, guillotined</span>
				<span class='text'>David once again organized a spectacular funeral, and Marat was buried in the Panthéon</span>
				<span class='text'>Marat's body was to be placed upon a Roman bed, his wound displayed and his right arm extended holding the pen which he had used to defend the Republic and its people</span>
				<span class='text'>This concept was to be complicated by the fact that the corpse had begun to putrefy</span>
				<span class='text'>Marat's body had to be periodically sprinkled with water and vinegar as the public crowded to see his corpse prior to the funeral on 15 and 16 July</span>
				<span class='text'>The stench became so bad however that the funeral had to be brought forward to the evening of 16 July</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schama|1989|p=83}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; ''The Death of Marat'', perhaps David's most famous painting, has been called the [[Pietà]] of the revolution</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon presenting the painting to the convention, he said &quot;Citizens, the people were again calling for their friend; their desolate voice was heard: David, take up your brushes</span>
				<span class='text'>, avenge Marat</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>I heard the voice of the people</span>
				<span class='text'>I obeyed</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;  David had to work quickly, but the result was a simple and powerful image</span>
				<span class='text'>'The Death of Marat'', 1793, became the leading image of the Terror and immortalized both Marat and David in the world of the revolution</span>
				<span class='text'>This piece stands today as &quot;a moving testimony to what can be achieved when an artist's political convictions are directly manifested in his work&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boime|1987|p=454}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  A political martyr was instantly created as David portrayed Marat with all the marks of the real murder, in a fashion which greatly resembles that of Christ or his disciples</span>

				<span class='text'>With the surrogate tombstone placed in front of him and the almost holy light cast upon the whole scene; alluding to an out of this world existence</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Janson|Rosenblum|1984|p=30}}</span>

				<span class='text'>[[Marie Antoinette]] went to the guillotine; an event recorded in a famous sketch by David</span>
				<span class='text'>Portable guillotines killed failed generals, aristocrats, priests and perceived enemies</span>
				<span class='text'>David organized his last festival: the festival of the Supreme Being</span>
				<span class='text'>Robespierre had realized what a tremendous propaganda tool these festivals were, and he decided to create a new religion, mixing moral ideas with the Republic, based on the ideas of Rousseau, with Robespierre as the new high priest</span>
				<span class='text'>This process had already begun by confiscating church lands and requiring priests to take an oath to the state</span>
				<span class='text'>The festivals, called fêtes, would be the method of indoctrination</span>
				<span class='text'>On the appointed day, 20 Prairial by the [[French Republican Calendar|revolutionary calendar]], Robespierre spoke, descended steps, and with a torch presented to him by David, incinerated a cardboard image symbolizing atheism, revealing an image of wisdom underneath</span>
				<span class='text'>oon, the war began to go well; French troops marched across the southern half of the Netherlands (which would later become Belgium), and the emergency that had placed the Committee of Public Safety in control was no more</span>
				<span class='text'>Then plotters seized Robespierre at the National Convention and he was later guillotined, in effect ending the Reign of Terror</span>
				<span class='text'>As Robespierre was arrested, David yelled to his friend &quot;if you drink hemlock, I shall drink it with you</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; After this, he supposedly fell ill, and did not attend the evening session because of &quot;stomach pain&quot;, which saved him from being guillotined along with Robespierre</span>

				<span class='text'>The new style was influenced heavily by the work of art historian Johann Joachim Winkelmann</span>
				<span class='text'>In David's words, &quot;the most prominent general characteristics of the Greek masterpieces are a noble simplicity and silent greatness in pose as well as in expression</span>

				<span class='text'>The story for the painting is as follows: &quot;The Romans have abducted the daughters of their neighbors, the Sabines</span>
				<span class='text'>To avenge this abduction, the Sabines attacked Rome, although not immediately—since Hersilia, the daughter of Tatius, the leader of the Sabines, had been married to [[Romulus]], the Roman leader, and then had two children by him in the interim</span>
				<span class='text'>Here we see Hersilia between her father and husband as she adjures the warriors on both sides not to take wives away from their husbands or mothers away from their children</span>
				<span class='text'>The other Sabine Women join in her exhortations</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; During this time, the martyrs of the Revolution were taken from the Pantheon and buried in common ground, and revolutionary statues were destroyed</span>
				<span class='text'>When David was finally released to the country, France had changed</span>
				<span class='text'>His wife managed to get him released from prison, and he wrote letters to his former wife, and told her he never ceased loving her</span>
				<span class='text'> He remarried her in 1796</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally, wholly restored to his position, he retreated to his studio, took pupils and for the most part, retired from politics</span>
				<span class='text'>n August 1796, David and many other artists signed a petition orchestrated by [[Quatremère de Quincy]] which questioned the wisdom of the planned seizure of works of art from Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>The Director Barras believed that David was &quot;tricked&quot; into signing, although one of David's students recalled that in 1798 his master lamented the fact that masterpieces had been imported from Italy</span>

				<span class='text'>avid had been an admirer of Napoleon from their first meeting, struck by Bonaparte's classical features</span>
				<span class='text'>Requesting a sitting from the busy and impatient general, David was able to sketch Napoleon in 1797</span>
				<span class='text'>David recorded the face of the conqueror of Italy, but the full composition of Napoleon holding the peace treaty with Austria remains unfinished</span>
				<span class='text'>Bonaparte had high esteem for David, and asked him to accompany him to [[Egypt]] in 1798, but David refused, claiming he was too old for adventuring and sending instead his student, [[Antoine-Jean Gros]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Mistreated and starved, the imprisoned Louis XVII was forced into a false confession of incest with his mother, Queen Marie-Antoinette</span>
				<span class='text'>This was untrue, as the son was separated from his mother early and was not allowed communication with her, nevertheless, the allegation helped earn her the guillotine</span>
				<span class='text'>The newly restored Bourbon King, Louis XVIII, however, granted amnesty to David and even offered him the position of court painter</span>
				<span class='text'>David refused, preferring self-exile in Brussels</span>
				<span class='text'>There, he trained and influenced Brussels artists like [[François-Joseph Navez]] and [[Ignace Brice]], painted ''Cupid and Psyche'' and quietly lived the remainder of his life with his wife (whom he had remarried)</span>
				<span class='text'>In that time, he painted smaller-scale mythological scenes, and portraits of citizens of Brussels and Napoleonic émigrés, such as the Baron Gerard</span>
				<span class='text'>avid created his last great work, ''[[Mars Being Disarmed by Venus|Mars Being Disarmed by Venus and the Three Graces]]'', from 1822 to 1824</span>
				<span class='text'>In December 1823, he wrote: &quot;This is the last picture I want to paint, but I want to surpass myself in it</span>
				<span class='text'>I will put the date of my seventy-five years on it and afterwards I will never again pick up my brush</span>

				<span class='text'>In his later years, David remained in full command of his artistic faculties, even after a stroke in the spring of 1825 disfigured his face and slurred his speech</span>
				<span class='text'>In June 1825, he resolved to embark on an improved version of his &quot;Anger of Achilles&quot; (also known as the &quot;Sacrifice of Iphigenie&quot;); the earlier version was completed in 1819 and is now in the collection of the [[Kimbell Art Museum|Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth, Texas]]</span>
				<span class='text'>David remarked to his friends who visited his studio &quot;this [painting] is what is killing me&quot; such was his determination to complete the work, but by October it must have already been well advanced, as his former pupil Gros wrote to congratulate him, having heard reports of the painting's merits</span>
				<span class='text'>By the time David died, the painting had been completed and the commissioner Ambroise Firmin-Didot brought it back to Paris to include it in the exhibition &quot;Pour les grecs&quot; that he had organised and which opened in Paris in April 1826</span>

				<span class='text'>A sword scar wound on the left side of his face is present in his self-portrait and sculptures and corresponds to some of the buccal branches of the facial nerve</span>
				<span class='text'>An injury to this nerve and its branches are likely to have resulted in the difficulties with his left facial movement</span>
				<span class='text'>urthermore, as a result of this injury, he suffered from a growth on his face that biographers and art historians have defined as a [[benign tumor]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Lee 321&quot;/&gt;  Another pupil of David's, [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]] became the most important artist of the restored Royal Academy and the figurehead of the Neoclassical school of art, engaging the increasingly popular Romantic school of art that was beginning to challenge Neoclassicism</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Lee 321&quot;/&gt; David invested in the formation of young artists for the Rome Prize, which was also a way to pursue his old rivalry with other contemporary painters such as [[Joseph Suvee]], who also had opened teaching studios</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;P</span>
				<span class='text'>Bordes, Jacques-Louis David:Empire to Exile</span>
				<span class='text'>Yale University Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; To be one of David's students was considered prestigious and earned his students a lifetime of reputation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Lee 321–322&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Simon|title=David|pages=321–322}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also called on the more advanced students, such as [[Jérôme-Martin Langlois]], to help him paint his large canvases</span>
				<span class='text'>espite David's reputation, he was more fiercely criticized right after his death than at any point during his life</span>
				<span class='text'>His style came under the most serious criticism for being static, rigid, and uniform throughout all his work</span>
				<span class='text'>David's art was also attacked for being cold and lacking warmth</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Simon|title=David|pages=322}}&lt;/ref&gt; David, however, made his career precisely by challenging what he saw as the earlier rigidity and conformity of the French Royal Academy's approach to art</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Warren|title=Jacques-Louis David, Revolutionary Artist|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; David's later works also reflect his growth in the development of the [[Empire style]], notable for its dynamism and warm colors</span>
				<span class='text'>It is likely that much of the criticism of David following his death came from David's opponents; during his lifetime David made a great many enemies with his competitive and arrogant personality as well as his role in the Terror</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Lee 321–322&quot;/&gt; David sent many people to the guillotine and personally signed the death warrants for [[King Louis XVI]] and [[Marie Antoinette]]</span>
				<span class='text'>One significant episode in David's political career that earned him a great deal of contempt was the execution of Emilie Chalgrin</span>
				<span class='text'>A fellow painter [[Carle Vernet]] had approached David, who was on the [[Committee of Public Safety]], requesting him to intervene on behalf of his sister, Chalgrin</span>
				<span class='text'>She had been accused of crimes against the Republic, most notably possessing stolen items</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Simon|title=David|pages=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; David refused to intervene in her favor, and she was executed</span>
				<span class='text'>Vernet blamed David for her death, and the episode followed him for the rest of his life and after</span>
				<span class='text'>n the last 50 years David has enjoyed a revival in popular favor and in 1948 his two-hundredth birthday was celebrated with an exhibition at the [[Musée de l'Orangerie]] in Paris and at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] showing his life's works</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Simon|title=David|pages=326}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following World War II, Jacques-Louis David was increasingly regarded as a symbol of French national pride and identity, as well as a vital force in the development of European and French art in the modern era</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Simon|title=David|pages=328}}&lt;/ref&gt;==Filmography==''[[Danton (1983 film)|Danton]]'' ([[Andrzej Wajda]], France, 1982) – Historical drama</span>
				<span class='text'>Many scenes include David as a silent character watching and drawing</span>
				<span class='text'>The film focuses on the period of the Terror</span>
