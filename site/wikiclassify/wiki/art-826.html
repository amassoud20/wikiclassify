				<span class='text'>His best known work is considered [[Hundertwasserhaus]] in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]] which has become a notable place of interest in the Austrian capital characterized by imaginative vitality and uniqueness</span>

				<span class='text'>Hundertwasser was baptized as a Catholic in 1935</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Hundertwasser developed artistic skills early on</span>
				<span class='text'>After the war, he spent three months at the [[Academy of Fine Arts Vienna|Academy of Fine Arts]] in Vienna</span>
				<span class='text'>At this time he began to sign his art as Hundertwasser instead of Stowasser</span>
				<span class='text'>He left to travel using a small set of paints he carried at all times to sketch anything that caught his eye</span>
				<span class='text'>In Florence he met the young French painter [[René Brô]] for the first time and they became lifelong friends</span>
				<span class='text'>Hundertwasser's first commercial painting success was in 1952–53 with an exhibition in Vienna</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Hundertwasser hannover 1965</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|Hundertwasser (left) 1965 in Hannover]]His adopted surname is based on the translation of &quot;sto&quot; (the Slavic word for &quot;(one) hundred&quot;) into German</span>
				<span class='text'>The name ''Friedensreich'' has a double meaning as &quot;Peace-realm&quot; or &quot;Peace-rich&quot; (in the sense of &quot;peaceful&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>Therefore, his name ''Friedensreich Hundertwasser'' translates directly into English as &quot;Peace-Realm Hundred-Water&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The other names he chose for himself, ''Regentag'' and ''Dunkelbunt'', translate to &quot;Rainy day&quot; and &quot;Darkly multi-coloured&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>eginning in the early 1950s, he entered the field of architecture</span>
				<span class='text'>Hundertwasser also worked in the field of applied art, creating flags, stamps, coins, and posters</span>
				<span class='text'>His most famous flag is [[Hundertwasser koru flag|his koru flag]], as well as several postage stamps for the Austrian Post Office</span>

				<span class='text'>2&lt;/ref&gt;In 1959 Hundertwasser got involved with helping the [[Dalai Lama]] escape from [[Tibet]] by campaigning for the Tibetan religious leader in Carl Laszlo's magazine ''Panderma''</span>
				<span class='text'>In later years, when he was already a known artist, Friedensreich Hundertwasser became an [[environmental activist]] and most recently operated as a more prominent opponent of the [[European Union]], advocating the preservation of regional peculiarities</span>
				<span class='text'>mong the lesser-known facets of Hundertwasser's personality is his commitment to [[constitutional monarchy]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;Austria needs something to look up to, consisting of perennial higher values{{mdash}}of which one now hardly dares to speak{{mdash}}such as beauty, culture, internal and external peace, faith, richness of heart [</span>

				<span class='text'>A superior and radiant figure in whom everyone has confidence, because this great figure is a possession of all</span>
				<span class='text'> The rationalist way of thinking has brought us, in this century, an ephemeral higher, American standard of living at the expense of nature and creation, which is now coming to an end, for it is destroying our heart, our quality of life, our longing, without which an Austrian does not want to live</span>

				<span class='text'> These designs use irregular forms, and incorporate natural features of the landscape</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''[[Hundertwasserhaus]]'' apartment block in Vienna has undulating floors (&quot;an uneven floor is a melody to the feet&quot;), a roof covered with earth and grass, and large trees growing from inside the rooms, with limbs extending from windows</span>
				<span class='text'>He took no payment for the design of ''Hundertwasserhaus'', declaring that it was worth the investment to &quot;prevent something ugly from going up in its place&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>rom the early 1950s he increasingly focused on architecture, advocating more just human and environmental friendly buildings</span>
				<span class='text'>This began with manifestos, essays and demonstrations</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, he read out his &quot;Mouldiness Manifesto against Rationalism in Architecture&quot; in 1958 on the occasion of an art and architectural event held at the Seckau Monastery</span>
				<span class='text'>He rejected the straight line and the functional architecture</span>

				<span class='text'>His lecture &quot;Loose from Loos, A Law Permitting Individual Buildings Alterations or Architecture-Boycott Manifesto&quot;, was given at the Concordia Press Club in Vienna in 1968</span>
				<span class='text'>n the Mouldiness Manifesto he first claimed the &quot;Window Right&quot;: &quot;A person in a rented apartment must be able to lean out of his window and scrape off the masonry within arm's reach</span>
				<span class='text'>And he must be allowed to take a long brush and paint everything outside within arm's reach</span>

				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;1167–1172</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;For Hundertwasser, human misery was a result of the rational, sterile, monotonous architecture, built following the tradition of the Austrian architect [[Adolf Loos]], author of the modernist manifesto ''[[Ornament and crime]]'' (1908)</span>
				<span class='text'>He called for a boycott of this type of architecture, and demanded instead creative freedom of building, and the right to create individual structures</span>

				<span class='text'>Planting trees in an urban environment was to become obligatory: &quot;If man walks in nature's midst, then he is nature's guest and must learn to behave as a well-brought-up guest</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Hundertwasser propagated a type of architecture in harmony with nature is his ecological commitment</span>
				<span class='text'>He campaigned for the preservation of the natural habitat and demanded a life in accordance with the laws of nature</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote numerous manifestos, lectured and designed posters in favor of nature protection, including against [[nuclear power]], to save the oceans and the whales and to protect the rain forest</span>
				<span class='text'>He was also an advocate of [[composting toilet]]s and the principle of [[constructed wetland]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He perceived [[feces]] not as nauseous but as part of the cycle of nature</span>
				<span class='text'>His beliefs are testified by his manifesto ''The Holy Shit'' and his DIY guide for building a composting toilet</span>

				<span class='text'>In these and similar models he developed new architectural shapes, such as the spiral house, the eye-slit house, the terrace house and the high-rise meadow house</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1974, Peter Manhardt made models for him of the pit house, the grass roof house and the green service station – along with his idea of the invisible, inaudible Green Motorway</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=May 2014}}In the early 1980s Hundertwasser remodelled the Rosenthal Factory in Selb, and the Mierka Grain Silo in Krems</span>

				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=May 2014}}In architectural projects that followed he implemented window right and tree tenants, uneven floors, woods on the roof, and spontaneous vegetation</span>
