				<span class='text'>After his studies he wrote for the ''[[Rheinische Zeitung]]'', a radical newspaper in [[Cologne]], and began to work out the theory of the [[materialist conception of history]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He moved to Paris in 1843, where he began writing for other radical newspapers and met [[Friedrich Engels]], who would become his lifelong friend and collaborator</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1849 he was exiled and moved to London together with his wife and children, where he continued writing and formulating his theories about social and economic activity</span>
				<span class='text'>He also campaigned for socialism and became a significant figure in the [[International Workingmen's Association]]</span>
				<span class='text'>arx's theories about society, economics and politics—the collective understanding of which is known as [[Marxism]]—hold that human societies progress through [[class struggle]]: a conflict between an ownership class that controls production and a dispossessed labouring class that provides the labour for production</span>
				<span class='text'>States, Marx believed, were run on behalf of the ruling class and in their interest while representing it as the [[general will|common interest]] of all;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>For each new class which puts itself in the place of one ruling before it is compelled, merely in order to carry through its aim, to represent its interest as the common interest of all the members of society, that is, expressed in ideal form: it has to give its ideas the form of universality, and represent them as the only rational, universally valid ones</span>

				<span class='text'>He argued that class antagonisms under capitalism between the bourgeoisie and proletariat would eventuate in the working class' conquest of political power and eventually establish a classless society, communism, a society governed by a [[free association (communism and anarchism)|free association of producers]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Karl's father, as a child known as Herschel, was the first in the line to receive a secular education; he became a lawyer and lived a relatively wealthy and middle-class existence, with his family owning a number of [[Moselle wine|Moselle]] vineyards</span>
				<span class='text'> Prior to his son's birth, and to escape the constraints of [[anti-Semitism|anti-semitic]] legislation, Herschel converted from [[Judaism]] to [[Lutheranism]], the main [[Protestant]] [[Christian denominations|denomination]] in Germany and Prussia at the time, taking on the German forename of Heinrich over the [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] Herschel</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Young Karl was privately educated, by Heinrich Marx, until 1830, when he entered Trier High School, whose headmaster, Hugo Wyttenbach, was a friend of his father</span>
				<span class='text'>By employing many [[Liberal humanism|liberal humanists]] as teachers, Wyttenbach incurred the anger of the local conservative government</span>
				<span class='text'>Subsequently, police raided the school in 1832, and discovered that literature espousing political liberalism was being distributed among the students</span>
				<span class='text'> Considering the distribution of such material a seditious act, the authorities instituted reforms and replaced several staff during Marx's attendance</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976 |pp=12–15}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=13}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=7–11}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In October 1835 at the age of 17, Marx travelled to the [[University of Bonn]] wishing to study philosophy and literature; however, his father insisted on law as a more practical field</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976 |pp=15–16}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=14}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=13}}</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Karl was excused from military duty when he turned 18</span>
				<span class='text'> While at the University at Bonn, Marx joined the Poets' Club, a group containing political radicals that was being monitored by the police</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976 |p=20}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=14}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Marx also joined the Trier Tavern Club drinking society (''Landsmannschaft der Treveraner''), at one point serving as club co-president</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=16}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=14}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Marx was involved in certain disputes, some of which became serious: in August 1836 he took part in a duel with a member of the university's Borussian Korps</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976 |pp=21–22}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=14}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Although his grades in the first term were good, they soon deteriorated, leading his father to force a transfer to the more serious and academic [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976 |p=22}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=16–17}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=14}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Hegelianism and early activism: 1836–1843===Spending summer and autumn 1836 in Trier, Marx became more serious about his studies and his life</span>
				<span class='text'>He became engaged to [[Jenny von Westphalen]], an educated baroness of the Prussian ruling class who had known Marx since childhood</span>
				<span class='text'>Having broken off her engagement with a young aristocrat to be with Marx, their relationship was socially controversial due to the differences between their religious and class origins, but Marx befriended her father, a liberal aristocrat, [[Ludwig von Westphalen]], and later dedicated his doctoral thesis to him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fedoseyev|1973|p=23}}; {{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=23–30}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=16–21, 33}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=15, 20}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Seven years after their engagement, on 19 June 1843, Marx married Jenny in a Protestant church in [[Bad Kreuznach|Kreuznach]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In October 1836 Marx arrived in Berlin, matriculating in the university's faculty of law and renting a room in the Mittelstrasse</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=31}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=15}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Although studying law, he was fascinated by philosophy, and looked for a way to combine the two, believing that &quot;without philosophy nothing could be accomplished&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=33}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=21}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Marx became interested in the recently deceased German philosopher [[G</span>
				<span class='text'>W</span>
				<span class='text'>F</span>
				<span class='text'>Hegel]], whose ideas were then widely debated among European philosophical circles</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; During a convalescence in Stralau, he joined the Doctor's Club (''Doktorklub''), a student group which discussed Hegelian ideas, and through them became involved with a group of [[Political radicalism|radical thinkers]] known as the [[Young Hegelians]] in 1837; they gathered around [[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Ludwig Feuerbach]] and [[Bruno Bauer]], with Marx developing a particularly close friendship with Adolf Rutenberg</span>
				<span class='text'>Like Marx, the Young Hegelians were critical of Hegel's [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] assumptions, but adopted his [[dialectical method]] in order to criticise established society, politics, and religion from a leftist perspective</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; [[Marxism]] is based in large part on three influences: [[Hegel]]'s dialectics, French utopian socialism and English economics</span>
				<span class='text'> Together with his earlier study of Hegel's dialectics, the studying that Marx did during this time in Paris meant that all major components of &quot;Marxism&quot; (or political economy as Marx called it) were in place by the autumn of 1844</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;An outline of &quot;Marxism&quot; had definitely formed in the mind of Karl Marx by late 1844</span>
				<span class='text'> Indeed, many features of the Marxist view of the world's political economy had been worked out in great detail</span>
				<span class='text'> However, Marx needed to write down all of the details of his economic world view to further clarify the new economic theory in his own mind</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Note 54 contained on page 598 in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 3''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Accordingly, Marx wrote ''[[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844|The Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, &quot;Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844&quot; ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 3'' (International Publishers: New York, 1975) pp</span>
				<span class='text'>229–346</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  These manuscripts covered numerous topics, detailing Marx's concept of [[alienated labour]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=sep/&gt;  However, by the spring of 1845 his continued study of political economy, capital and capitalism had led Marx to the belief that the new political economic theory that he was espousing—scientific socialism—needed to be built on the base of a thoroughly developed materialistic view of the world</span>

				<span class='text'>Soon, though, Marx recognised that the ''Manuscripts'' had been influenced by some inconsistent ideas of Ludwig Feuerbach</span>
				<span class='text'> Accordingly, Marx recognised the need to break with Feuerbach's philosophy in favour of historical materialism</span>
				<span class='text'> Thus, a year later, in April 1845, after moving from Paris to Brussels, Marx wrote his eleven ''[[Theses on Feuerbach]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, &quot;Theses on Feuerbach&quot;, contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 5'' (International Publishers: New York, 1976) pp</span>
				<span class='text'>3–14</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  This work contains Marx's criticism of [[materialism]] (for being contemplative), [[idealism]] (for reducing practice to theory) overall, criticising philosophy for putting abstract reality above the physical world</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=sep/&gt; It thus introduced the first glimpse at Marx's [[historical materialism]], an argument that the world is changed not by ideas but by actual, physical, material activity and practice</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In collaboration with Engels, Marx also set about writing a book which is often seen as his best treatment of the concept of [[historical materialism]], ''[[The German Ideology]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, &quot;German Ideology&quot; contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 5'' (International Publishers: New York, 1976) pp</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  In this work, Marx broke with [[Feuerbach]], [[Bruno Bauer]], [[Max Stirner]] and the rest of the Young Hegelians, and also broke with [[Karl Grun]] and other &quot;true socialists&quot; whose philosophies were still based in part on &quot;idealism</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;  In ''German Ideology'' Marx and Engels finally completed their philosophy, which was based solely on materialism as the sole motor force in history</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;After completing ''German Ideology'', Marx turned to a work that was intended to clarify his own position regarding &quot;the theory and tactics&quot; of a truly &quot;revolutionary proletarian movement&quot; operating from the standpoint of a truly &quot;scientific materialist&quot; philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See Note 71 on p</span>
				<span class='text'>672 of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 6'' (International Publishers: New York, 1976)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  This work was intended to draw a distinction between the utopian socialists and Marx's own scientific socialist philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'> Whereas the utopians believed that people must be persuaded one person at a time to join the socialist movement, the way a person must be persuaded to adopt any different belief, Marx knew that people would tend on most occasions to act in accordance with their own economic interests</span>
				<span class='text'> Thus, appealing to an entire class (the working class in this case) with a broad appeal to the class's best material interest would be the best way to mobilise the broad mass of that class to make a revolution and change society</span>
				<span class='text'> This was the intent of the new book that Marx was planning</span>
				<span class='text'> However, to get the manuscript past the government censors, Marx called the book ''[[The Poverty of Philosophy]]'' (1847)&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, ''The Poverty of Philosophy'' contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 6''(International Publishers: New York, 1976) pp</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Such an uprising as that recommended by the Schapper/Willich group would easily be crushed by the police and the armed forces of the reactionary governments of Europe</span>
				<span class='text'> This, Marx maintained, would spell doom for the Communist League itself</span>

				<span class='text'>233&quot;/&gt;  Instead, they are brought about through a scientific analysis of economic conditions of society and by moving toward revolution through different stages of social development</span>
				<span class='text'> In the present stage of development (circa 1850), following the defeat of the uprisings across Europe in 1848, Marx felt that the Communist League should encourage the working class to unite with progressive elements of the rising bourgeoisie to defeat the feudal aristocracy on issues involving demands for governmental reforms, such as a constitutional republic with freely elected assemblies and universal (male) suffrage</span>
				<span class='text'> In other words, the working class must join with bourgeois and democratic forces to bring about the successful conclusion of the bourgeois revolution before stressing the working class agenda and a working class revolution</span>
				<span class='text'>fter a long struggle which threatened to ruin the Communist League, Marx's opinion prevailed and, eventually, the Willich/Schapper group left the Communist League</span>
				<span class='text'>Meanwhile, Marx also became heavily involved with the socialist [[German Workers' Educational Society]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Marx, however, lost the fight with the Schapper/Willich faction within the German Workers' Educational Society and, on 17 September 1850, resigned from the Society</span>

				<span class='text'>295</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Most of Marx's journalistic writing, however, was as a European correspondent for the ''[[New York Daily Tribune]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In earlier years, Marx had been able to communicate with the broad masses of the working class by editing his own newspaper or editing a newspaper financed by others sympathetic to his philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>Now, in London, Marx was unable to finance his own newspaper and unable to put together financing from others</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, Marx sought to communicate with the public by writing articles for the ''New York Tribune'' and other &quot;bourgeois&quot; newspapers</span>
				<span class='text'>At first Marx's English-language articles were translated from German by [[Wilhelm Pieper]]; eventually, however, Marx learned English well enough to write without translation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Dispatches&quot; /&gt;The ''New York Daily Tribune'' had been founded in New York City in the United States of America by [[Horace Greeley]] in April 1841</span>

				<span class='text'>Fedoseyev, ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', 274</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Marx's main contact on the ''Tribune'' was [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles Dana]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Later, in 1868, Charles Dana would leave the ''Tribune'' to become the owner and editor-in-chief of the ''New York Sun'', a competing newspaper in New York City</span>

				<span class='text'>121</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; However, at this time Charles Dana served on the editorial board of the ''Tribune''</span>
				<span class='text'>everal characteristics about the ''Tribune'' made the newspaper an excellent vehicle for Marx to reach a sympathetic public across the Atlantic Ocean</span>
				<span class='text'>Since its founding, the ''Tribune'' had been an inexpensive newspaper—two cents per copy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Taken from a picture on page 327 of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 11'' (International Publishers: New York, 1979)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, it was popular with the broad masses of the working class of the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>With a run of about 50,000 issues, the ''Tribune'' was the most widely circulated journal in the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Richard Kluger, ''The Paper: The Life and Death of the New York Herald Tribune'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>14</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Editorially, the ''Tribune'' reflected Greeley's anti-slavery opinions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Richard Kluger, ''The Paper: The Life and Death of the New York Herald Tribune'' (Alfred A</span>
				<span class='text'>Knoft: New York, 1986), p, 82</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Not only did the ''Tribune'' have wide readership with the United States and not only did that readership come from the working classes, but the readers seemed to be from the progressive wing of the working class</span>
				<span class='text'>Marx's first article for the ''New York Tribune'' was on the British elections to Parliament and was published in the ''Tribune'' on 21 August 1852</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, &quot;The Elections in England – Tories and Whigs&quot; contained in the''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 11'' (International Publishers: New York, 1979) pp</span>
				<span class='text'>327–332</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Marx was just one of the reporters in Europe that the ''New York Tribune'' employed</span>
				<span class='text'>However, with the slavery crisis in the United States coming to a head in the late 1850s and with the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] in 1861, the American public's interest in European affairs declined</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Note 1 at page 367 contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 19'' (International Publishers: New York, 1984)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Thus Marx very early began to write on issues affecting the United States — particularly the &quot;slavery crisis&quot; and the &quot;War Between the States</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;Marx continued to write articles for the ''New York Daily Tribune'' as long as he was sure that the ''Tribune's'' editorial policy was still progressive</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the departure of Charles Dana from the paper in late 1861 and the resultant change in the editorial board brought about a new editorial policy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Sperber, ''Karl Marx: A Nineteenth-Century Life'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>347</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; No longer was the ''Tribune'' to be a strong [[abolitionist]] paper dedicated to a complete [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] victory</span>
				<span class='text'>The new editorial board supported an immediate peace between the Union and the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] in the Civil War in the United States with slavery left intact in the Confederacy</span>
				<span class='text'>Marx strongly disagreed with this new political position and, in 1863, was forced to withdraw as a writer for the ''Tribune</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Hook1994&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GeorgeScanlan1975&quot;/&gt; The years of revolution from 1848 to 1849 had been a grand experience for both Marx and Engels</span>
				<span class='text'>They both became sure that their economic view of the course of history was the only valid way that historic events like the revolutionary upsurge of 1848 could be adequately explained</span>
				<span class='text'>For some time after 1848, Marx and Engels wondered if the entire revolutionary upsurge had completely played out</span>
				<span class='text'>As time passed, they began to think that a new revolutionary upsurge would not occur until there was another economic downturn</span>
				<span class='text'>The question of whether a recession would be necessary to create a new [[revolutionary situation]] in society became a point of contention between Marx and certain other revolutionaries</span>
				<span class='text'>Marx accused these other revolutionaries of being &quot;adventurists&quot; because of their belief that a revolutionary situation could be created out of thin air by the sheer &quot;will power&quot; of the revolutionaries without regard to the economic realities of the current situation</span>
				<span class='text'>he downturn in the United States economy in 1852 led Marx and Engels to wonder if a revolutionary upsurge would soon occur</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the United States' economy was too new to play host to a classical revolution</span>
				<span class='text'>The western frontier in America always provided a relief valve for the pent-up forces that might in other countries cause social unrest</span>
				<span class='text'>Any economic crisis which began in the United States would not lead to revolution unless one of the older economies of Europe &quot;caught the contagion&quot; from the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>In other words, economies of the world were still seen as individual national systems which were contiguous with the national borders of each country</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Panic of 1857]] broke the mould of all prior thinking on the world economy</span>
				<span class='text'>Beginning in the United States, the Panic spread across the globe</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Sperber, ''Karl Marx: A Nineteenth-Century'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>320</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the Panic of 1857 was the first truly global economic crisis</span>
				<span class='text'>arx longed to return to his economic studies</span>
				<span class='text'>He had left these studies in 1844 and had been preoccupied with other projects over the last thirteen years</span>
				<span class='text'>By returning to his study of economics, he felt he would be able to understand more thoroughly what was occurring in the world</span>
				<span class='text'>=The First International==In 1864, Marx became involved in the [[International Workingmen's Association]] (also known as ''First International''),&lt;ref name=&quot;Nicolaievsky2007&quot;/&gt; to whose General Council he was elected at its inception in 1864</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Nicolaievsky2007-267&quot;/&gt; In that organisation, Marx was involved in the struggle against the anarchist wing centred on [[Mikhail Bakunin]] (1814–1876)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=egsbio/&gt; Although Marx won this contest, the transfer of the seat of the General Council from London to New York in 1872, which Marx supported, led to the decline of the International</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;JessopWheatley1999-526&quot;/&gt; The most important political event during the existence of the International was the [[Paris Commune]] of 1871, when the citizens of Paris rebelled against their government and held the city for two months</span>
				<span class='text'>In response to the bloody suppression of this rebellion, Marx wrote one of his most famous pamphlets, ''[[The Civil War in France]]'', a defence of the Commune</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Given the repeated failures and frustrations of workers' revolutions and movements, Marx also sought to understand capitalism, and spent a great deal of time in the reading room of the [[British Museum]] studying and reflecting on the works of [[political economy|political economists]] and on economic data</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Calhoun2002-20&quot;/&gt; By 1857 he had accumulated over 800 pages of notes and short essays on capital, [[landed property]], wage labour, the state, and foreign trade and the world market; this work did not appear in print until 1939, under the title ''[[Grundrisse|''Outlines of the Critique of Political Economy'']]''</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The successful sales of ''A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy'' stimulated Marx in the early 1860s to finish work on the three large volumes that would compose his major life's work—''Das Kapital'' and the ''[[Theories of Surplus Value]]'', which discussed the theoreticians of political economy, particularly [[Adam Smith]] and David Ricardo</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=egsbio/&gt;  ''Theories of Surplus Value'' is often referred to as the fourth volume book of ''Das Kapital'' and constitutes one of the first comprehensive treatises on the [[history of economic thought]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Rockmore2002&quot;/&gt; In 1867 the first volume of ''Das Kapital'' was published, a work which analysed the capitalist process of production</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;BrewerMarx1984-15&quot;/&gt; Here Marx elaborated his [[labour theory of value]], which had been influenced by [[Thomas Hodgskin]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Marx acknowledged Hodgskin's &quot;admirable work&quot; ''Labour Defended against the Claims of Capital'' at more than one point in ''Capital</span>
				<span class='text'>'&lt;ref&gt;See footnote #2 on the bottom of page 360 in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 35''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, Marx quoted Hodgskin as recognising the alienation of labour that occurred under modern capitalist production</span>
				<span class='text'> No longer was there any &quot;natural reward of individual labour</span>
				<span class='text'> Each labourer produces only some part of a whole, and each part having no value or utility of itself, there is nothing on which the labourer can seize, and say: 'This is my product, this will I keep to myself</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hodgskin, ''Labour Defended against the Claims of Capital'' (London, 1825) p</span>
				<span class='text'>25</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  In this first volume of ''Capital'', Marx outlined his conception of [[surplus value]] and [[Exploit (sociology)|exploitation]], which he argued would ultimately lead to a falling rate of profit and the collapse of industrial capitalism</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Calhoun2002-23&quot;/&gt;  Demand for a Russian language edition of ''Capital'' soon led to the printing of 3,000 copies of the book in the Russian language, which was published on 27 March 1872</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=egsbio/&gt; He did manage to comment substantially on contemporary politics, particularly in Germany and Russia</span>
				<span class='text'>His ''[[Critique of the Gotha Programme]]'' opposed the tendency of his followers [[Wilhelm Liebknecht]] and [[August Bebel]] to compromise with the [[state socialism]] of [[Ferdinand Lassalle]] in the interests of a united socialist party</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=egsbio/&gt; This work is also notable for another famous Marx's quote: &quot;[[From each according to his ability, to each according to his need]]</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CGP P1&quot;/&gt;In a letter to [[Vera Zasulich]] dated 8 March 1881, Marx contemplated the possibility of Russia's bypassing the capitalist stage of development and building communism on the basis of the common ownership of land characteristic of the village ''[[mir (social)|mir]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=egsbio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, ''Collected Works Volume 46'' (International Publishers: New York, 1992) p</span>
				<span class='text'>71</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; While admitting that Russia's rural &quot;commune is the fulcrum of social regeneration in Russia&quot;, Marx also warned that, in order for the mir to operate as a means for moving straight to the socialist stage without a preceding capitalist stage, it &quot;would first be necessary to eliminate the deleterious influences which are assailing it (the rural commune) from all sides</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;k72&quot;/&gt; Given the elimination of these pernicious influences, Marx allowed that &quot;normal conditions of spontaneous development&quot; of the rural commune could exist</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=k72/&gt; However, in the same letter to Vera Zasulich, Marx points out that &quot;at the core of the capitalist system&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>lies the complete separation of the producer from the means of production</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=k72/&gt; In one of the drafts of this letter, Marx reveals his growing passion for anthropology, motivated by his belief that future communism would be a return on a higher level to the communism of our prehistoric past</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote that &quot;the historical trend of our age is the fatal crisis which capitalist production has undergone in the European and American countries where it has reached its highest peak, a crisis that will end in its destruction, in the return of modern society to a higher form of the most archaic type—collective production and appropriation&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He added that &quot;the vitality of primitive communities was incomparably greater than that of Semitic, Greek, Roman, etc</span>
				<span class='text'>societies, and, a fortiori, that of modern capitalist societies&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>arx's view of history, which came to be called [[historical materialism]] (controversially adapted as the philosophy of [[dialectical materialism]] by Engels and Lenin) certainly shows the influence of Hegel's claim that one should view reality (and history) [[dialectic]]ally</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Clark1998&quot;/&gt;The other important contribution to Marx's revision of Hegelianism came from Engels's book, ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'', which led Marx to conceive of the historical dialectic in terms of [[class conflict]] and to see the modern working class as the most progressive force for revolution</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; For both Marx and Hegel, self-development begins with an experience of internal [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] stemming from this recognition, followed by a realisation that the actual self, as a [[Subject (philosophy)|subjective]] agent, renders its potential counterpart an [[Object (philosophy)|object]] to be apprehended</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; the subject takes the object as its own, and thus permits the individual to be actualised as fully human</span>
				<span class='text'>For Marx, then, [[Marx's theory of human nature|human nature]]—''Gattungswesen'', or [[species-being]]—exists as a function of human labour</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;Marx_labour&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Marx_critique&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Holland_desire&quot;/&gt; Fundamental to Marx's idea of meaningful labour is the proposition that, in order for a subject to come to terms with its alienated object, it must first exert influence upon literal, material objects in the subject's world</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;Marx_objects&quot;/&gt; Marx acknowledges that Hegel &quot;grasps the nature of ''work'' and comprehends objective man, authentic because actual, as the result of his ''own work''&quot;,&lt;ref name = &quot;Marx_work&quot;&gt;Marx (1997), p</span>
				<span class='text'>321, emphasis in original</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; but characterises Hegelian self-development as unduly &quot;spiritual&quot; and abstract</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;Marx_spiritual&quot;&gt;Marx (1997), p</span>
				<span class='text'>324</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Marx thus departs from Hegel by insisting that &quot;the fact that man is a ''corporeal'', actual, sentient, objective being with natural capacities means that he has ''actual, sensuous objects'' for his nature as objects of his life-expression, or that he can only ''express'' his life in actual sensuous objects</span>

				<span class='text'>325, emphasis in original</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, Marx revises Hegelian &quot;work&quot; into material &quot;[[labour (economics)|labour]]&quot;, and in the context of human capacity to transform nature the term &quot;[[labour power]]&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Calhoun2002-22&quot;/&gt; He wrote extensively about this in terms of the problem of [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Mészáros2006&quot;/&gt; As with the dialectic, Marx began with a Hegelian notion of alienation but developed a more materialist conception</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Calhoun2002-22&quot;/&gt; Capitalism mediates social relationships of production (such as among workers or between workers and capitalists) through commodities, including labour, that are bought and sold on the market</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Calhoun2002-22&quot;/&gt; For Marx, the possibility that one may give up ownership of one's own labour—one's capacity to transform the world—is tantamount to being alienated from one's own nature; it is a spiritual loss</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Calhoun2002-22&quot;/&gt; Marx described this loss as [[commodity fetishism]], in which the things that people produce, commodities, appear to have a life and movement of their own to which humans and their behaviour merely adapt</span>

				<span class='text'>By &quot;ideology&quot;, Marx and Engels meant ideas that reflect the interests of a particular class at a particular time in history, but which contemporaries see as universal and eternal</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Hernadi1989&quot;/&gt; Marx and Engels's point was not only that such beliefs are at best half-truths; they serve an important political function</span>
				<span class='text'>Put another way, the control that one class exercises over the means of production includes not only the production of food or manufactured goods; it includes the production of ideas as well (this provides one possible explanation for why members of a subordinate class may hold ideas contrary to their own interests)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=sep/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson1990&quot;/&gt; An example of this sort of analysis is Marx's understanding of religion, summed up in a passage from the preface&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx: [http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;SwatosKivisto1998&quot;/&gt;====Economy, history, and society===={{further|Marxian economics}}Marx's thoughts on labour were related to the primacy he gave to the economic relation in determining the society's past, present and future (see also [[economic determinism]])</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Calhoun2002-20-23&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark1998&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Turner2005&quot;/&gt; [[Accumulation of capital]] shapes the [[social system]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Clark1998&quot;/&gt; [[Social change]], for Marx, was about conflict between opposing interests, driven, in the background, by economic forces</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Calhoun2002-20-23&quot;/&gt; This became the inspiration for the body of works known as the [[conflict theory]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Turner2005&quot;/&gt; In his [[sociocultural evolution|evolutionary]] model of history, he argued that [[human history]] began with free, productive and creative work that was over time coerced and dehumanised, a trend most apparent under capitalism</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Calhoun2002-20-23&quot;/&gt; Marx noted that this was not an intentional process; rather, no individual or even state can go against the forces of economy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Clark1998&quot;/&gt;The organisation of society depends on [[means of production]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Literally those things, like land, natural resources, and technology, necessary for the production of material goods and the [[relations of production]], in other words, the social relationships people enter into as they acquire and use the means of production</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Turner2005&quot;/&gt; Together these compose the [[mode of production]], and Marx distinguished historical eras in terms of distinct modes of production</span>
				<span class='text'>Marx differentiated between [[base and superstructure]], with the base (or substructure) referring to the economic system, and superstructure, to the cultural and political system</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Turner2005&quot;/&gt; Marx regarded this mismatch between (economic) base and (social) [[base and superstructure|superstructure]] as a major source of social disruption and conflict</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Turner2005&quot;/&gt;Despite Marx's stress on critique of capitalism and discussion of the new [[communist society]] that should replace it, his explicit critique of capitalism is guarded, as he saw it as an improved society compared to the past ones ([[slavery]] and [[feudal]])</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=sep/&gt; Marx also never clearly discusses issues of [[morality]] and [[justice]], although scholars agree that his work contained [[Logical implication|implicit]] discussion of those concepts</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Memorial to Karl Marx in Moscow</span>
				<span class='text'>The inscription reads &quot;[[Workers of the world, unite!|Proletarians of all countries, unite!]]&quot;]]Marx's view of capitalism was two-sided</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=sep/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wood1993&quot;/&gt; On one hand, Marx, in the 19th century's deepest critique of the dehumanising aspects of this system, noted that defining features of capitalism include alienation, exploitation, and recurring, cyclical [[economic depressions|depressions]] leading to mass unemployment; on the other hand capitalism is also characterised by &quot;revolutionising, industrialising and universalising qualities of development, growth and progressivity&quot; (by which Marx meant industrialisation, urbanisation, [[technological progress]], increased [[productivity]] and growth, [[rationality]] and [[scientific revolution]]), that are responsible for progress</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=sep/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wood1993&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Calhoun2002-20-23&quot;/&gt; Marx considered the capitalist class to be one of the most revolutionary in history, because it constantly improved the means of production, more so than any other class in history, and was responsible for the overthrow of [[feudalism]] and its transition to capitalism</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Clark1998&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilbert2010&quot;/&gt; Capitalism can stimulate considerable growth because the capitalist can, and has an incentive to, reinvest profits in new technologies and [[capital equipment]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Calhoun2002-22&quot;/&gt;According to Marx, capitalists take advantage of the difference between the labour market and the market for whatever commodity the capitalist can produce</span>
				<span class='text'>Marx observed that in practically every successful industry, input unit-costs are lower than output unit-prices</span>
				<span class='text'>Marx called the difference &quot;[[surplus value]]&quot; and argued that this surplus value had its source in [[surplus labour]], the difference between what it costs to keep workers alive and what they can produce</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=sep/&gt; Marx's dual view of capitalism can be seen in his description of the capitalists: he refers to them as to [[vampire]]s sucking worker's blood, but at the same time,&lt;ref name=&quot;Calhoun2002-20-23&quot;/&gt; he notes that drawing profit is &quot;by no means an injustice&quot;&lt;ref name=sep/&gt; and that capitalists simply cannot go against the system</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Clark1998&quot;/&gt; The true problem lies with the &quot;cancerous cell&quot; of [[Capital (economics)|capital]], understood not as property or equipment, but the relations between workers and owners—the economic system in general</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Clark1998&quot;/&gt;At the same time, Marx stressed that capitalism was unstable, and prone to [[crisis theory|periodic crises]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=wk/&gt; He suggested that over time, capitalists would invest more and more in new technologies, and less and less in labour</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=sep/&gt; Since Marx believed that surplus value appropriated from labour is the source of profits, he concluded that the rate of profit would fall even as the economy grew</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Calhoun2002-23&quot;/&gt; Marx believed that increasingly severe crises would punctuate this [[business cycles|cycle]] of growth, collapse, and more growth</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Calhoun2002-23&quot;/&gt; Moreover, he believed that in the long-term, this process would necessarily enrich and [[empowerment|empower]] the capitalist class and impoverish the proletariat</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Calhoun2002-23&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark1998&quot;/&gt; In section one of ''The Communist Manifesto'', Marx describes [[feudalism]], capitalism, and the role internal social contradictions play in the historical process:{{quote|We see then: the means of production and of exchange, on whose foundation the bourgeoisie built itself up, were generated in feudal society</span>
				<span class='text'>At a certain stage in the development of these means of production and of exchange, the conditions under which feudal society produced and exchanged&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>the feudal relations of property became no longer compatible with the already developed productive forces; they became so many fetters</span>
				<span class='text'>They had to be burst asunder; they were burst asunder</span>
				<span class='text'>Into their place stepped free competition, accompanied by a social and political constitution adapted in it, and the economic and political sway of the bourgeois class</span>
				<span class='text'>A similar movement is going on before our own eyes&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>The productive forces at the disposal of society no longer tend to further the development of the conditions of bourgeois property; on the contrary, they have become too powerful for these conditions, by which they are fettered, and so soon as they overcome these fetters, they bring order into the whole of bourgeois society, endanger the existence of bourgeois property</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Marx believed that industrial workers (the [[proletariat]]) would rise up around the world</span>
				<span class='text'>]Marx believed that those structural contradictions within capitalism necessitate its end, giving way to socialism, or a post-capitalistic, communist society:{{quote|The development of Modern Industry, therefore, cuts from under its feet the very foundation on which the bourgeoisie produces and appropriates products</span>
				<span class='text'>What the bourgeoisie, therefore, produces, above all, are its own grave-diggers</span>
				<span class='text'>Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;manifesto&quot;/&gt;}}Thanks to various processes overseen by capitalism, such as urbanisation, the working class, the proletariat, should grow in numbers and develop [[class consciousness]], in time realising that they have to and can change the system</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Calhoun2002-20-23&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark1998&quot;/&gt; Marx believed that if the proletariat were to seize the means of production, they would encourage social relations that would benefit everyone equally, abolishing exploiting class, and introduce a system of production less vulnerable to cyclical crises</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Calhoun2002-20-23&quot;/&gt; Marx argued in ''[[The German Ideology]]'' that capitalism will end through the organised actions of an international working class:{{quote|Communism is for us not a state of affairs which is to be established, an ideal to which reality will have to adjust itself</span>
				<span class='text'>We call communism the real movement which abolishes the present state of things</span>
				<span class='text'>The conditions of this movement result from the premises now in existence</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Elster1985&quot;/&gt;}}In this new society, the self-alienation would end, and humans would be free to act without being bound by the labour market</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Calhoun2002-23&quot;/&gt; It would be a democratic society, enfranchising the entire population</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Clark1998&quot;/&gt; In such a [[utopia]]n world there would also be little if any need for a state, which goal was to enforce the alienation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Calhoun2002-23&quot;/&gt; He theorised that between capitalism and the establishment of a socialist/communist system, a [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]—a period where the working class holds political power and forcibly socialises the means of production—would exist</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Clark1998&quot;/&gt; As he wrote in his &quot;[[Critique of the Gotha Program]]&quot;, &quot;between capitalist and communist society there lies the period of the revolutionary transformation of the one into the other</span>
				<span class='text'>Corresponding to this is also a political transition period in which the state can be nothing but the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Karl Marx:Critique of the Gotha Programme&quot;/&gt; While he allowed for the possibility of peaceful transition in some countries with strong democratic institutional structures (such as Britain, the US and the Netherlands), he suggested that in other countries with strong centralised state-oriented traditions, like France and Germany, the &quot;lever of our revolution must be force</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;You know that the institutions, mores, and traditions of various countries must be taken into consideration, and we do not deny that there are countries – such as America, England, and if I were more familiar with your institutions, I would perhaps also add Holland – where the workers can attain their goal by peaceful means</span>
				<span class='text'>This being the case, we must also recognise the fact that in most countries on the Continent the lever of our revolution must be force; it is force to which we must some day appeal to erect the rule of labour</span>

				<span class='text'>quot; Such has been, for example, the neo-marxist theorising adopted by historians inspired by Marx's social theory, such as [[E</span>
				<span class='text'>P</span>
				<span class='text'>Thompson]] and [[Eric Hobsbawm]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It has also been a line of thinking pursued by thinkers and activists like [[Antonio Gramsci]] who have sought to understand the opportunities and the difficulties of transformative political practice, seen in the light of Marxist social theory</span>
