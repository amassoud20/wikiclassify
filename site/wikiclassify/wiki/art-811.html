				<span class='text'>He then entered a [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in [[Kroměříž]] ({{lang-de|Kremsier}}), where he studied for three years</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1855 he became a student at the [[University of Vienna]]</span>
				<span class='text'>There he studied [[physics]] and for one semester medical physiology, receiving his doctorate in physics in 1860 and his Habilitation the following year</span>
				<span class='text'>His early work focused on the [[Doppler effect]] in [[optics]] and [[acoustics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1864 he took a job as Professor of Mathematics at the [[University of Graz]], having turned down the position of a chair in surgery at the University of Salzburg to do so, and in 1866 he was appointed as Professor of Physics</span>
				<span class='text'>During that period, Mach continued his work in [[psycho-physics]] and in sensory perception</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1867, he took the chair of Experimental Physics at the [[Karl-Ferdinands-Universität|Charles University]], [[Prague]], where he stayed for 28 years before returning to Vienna</span>
				<span class='text'>ach's main contribution to physics involved his description and photographs of spark shock-waves and then ballistic shock-waves</span>
				<span class='text'>He described how when a bullet or shell moved faster than the speed of sound, it created a compression of air in front of it</span>
				<span class='text'>Using [[schlieren photography]], he and his son Ludwig were able to photograph the shadows of the invisible shock waves</span>
				<span class='text'>During the early 1890s Ludwig was able to invent an interferometer which allowed for much clearer photographs</span>
				<span class='text'>But Mach also made many contributions to psychology and physiology, including his anticipation of [[Gestalt psychology|gestalt]] phenomena, his discovery of the [[oblique effect]] and of [[Mach bands]], an inhibition-influenced type of visual illusion, and especially his discovery of a [[Vestibular system|non-acoustic function]] of the inner ear which helps control human balance</span>
				<span class='text'>ne of the best-known of Mach's ideas is the so-called &quot;[[Mach's principle|Mach principle]],&quot; concerning the physical origin of inertia</span>
				<span class='text'>This was never written down by Mach, but was given a graphic verbal form, attributed by [[Philipp Frank]] to Mach himself, as, &quot;When the subway jerks, it's the fixed stars that throw you down</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;!--In this form its incompatibility with Einstein's conviction of the universal retardation of distant action is apparent</span>
				<span class='text'>As an experimental physicist Mach tended to think that scientific theories were only provisional and had no lasting place in physics</span>
				<span class='text'>This attitude made it hard for him to accept Einstein's special theory of relativity, especially since the second axiom seemed like an absolute of the kind Mach opposed, which was criticized in the preface to a posthumously published book on light which appeared in 1921</span>
				<span class='text'>-&gt;Mach also became well known for his philosophy developed in close interplay with his science</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;On this interdependency of Mach's physics, physiology, history and philosophy of science see Blackmore (1972), Blackmore (ed</span>
				<span class='text'> 1992 and Hentschel 1985 against Paul Feyerabend's efforts to decouple these three strands</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Mach defended a type of [[phenomenalism]] recognizing only [[Sensation and perception psychology|sensations]] as real</span>
				<span class='text'>This position seemed incompatible with the view of atoms and molecules as external, mind-independent things</span>
				<span class='text'>He famously declared, after an 1897 lecture by [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] at the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences|Imperial Academy of Science]] in [[Vienna]]: &quot;I don't believe that atoms exist!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Yourgrau&quot;&gt;Yourgrau, P</span>
				<span class='text'>(2005)</span>
				<span class='text'>''A World Without Time: The Forgotten Legacy of Gödel and Einstein''</span>
				<span class='text'>Allen Lane&lt;/ref&gt; From about 1908 to 1911 Mach's reluctance to acknowledge the reality of atoms was criticized by [[Max Planck]] as being incompatible with physics</span>
				<span class='text'>Einstein's [[Annus Mirabilis papers#Brownian motion|1905 demonstration]] that the statistical fluctuations of atoms allowed measurement of their existence without direct individuated sensory evidence marked a turning point in the acceptance of [[atomic theory]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Some of Mach's criticisms of Newton's position on space and time influenced Einstein, but later Einstein realized that Mach was basically opposed to Newton's philosophy and concluded that his physical criticism was not sound</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1898 Mach suffered from cardiac arrest and in 1901 retired from the University of Vienna and was appointed to the upper chamber of the Austrian parliament</span>
				<span class='text'>On leaving Vienna in 1913 he moved to his son's home in [[Vaterstetten]], near [[Munich]], where he continued writing and corresponding until his death in 1916</span>
				<span class='text'>His current living descendant is [[Marilyn vos Savant]] (her father was Joseph Mach)</span>

				<span class='text'>]Most of Mach's initial studies in the field of experimental physics concentrated on the [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]], [[diffraction]], [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] and [[refraction]] of light in different media under external influences</span>
				<span class='text'>From there followed important explorations in the field of [[supersonic]] fluid mechanics</span>

				<span class='text'>1988), and Blackmore et al</span>
				<span class='text'>2001)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  In his historico-philosophical studies, Mach developed a phenomenalistic [[philosophy of science]] which became influential in the 19th and 20th centuries</span>
				<span class='text'>He originally saw scientific laws as summaries of experimental events, constructed for the purpose of making complex data comprehensible, but later emphasized mathematical functions as a more useful way to describe sensory appearances</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus scientific laws while somewhat idealized have more to do with describing sensations than with reality as it exists beyond sensations</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Selections are taken from his essay ''The Economical Nature of Physical Inquiry'', excerpted by Kockelmans and slightly corrected by Blackmore</span>
				<span class='text'>(citation below)</span>

				<span class='text'>hen the human mind, with its limited powers, attempts to mirror in itself the rich life of the world, of which it itself is only a small part, and which it can never hope to exhaust, it has every reason for proceeding economically</span>
				<span class='text'>n reality, the law always contains less than the fact itself, because it does not reproduce the fact as a whole but only in that aspect of it which is important for us, the rest being intentionally or from necessity omitted</span>
				<span class='text'>}{{cquote|In mentally separating a body from the changeable environment in which it moves, what we really do is to extricate a group of sensations on which our thoughts are fastened and which is of relatively greater stability than the others, from the stream of all our sensations</span>

				<span class='text'>Nature exists once only</span>
				<span class='text'>Our schematic mental imitation alone produces like events</span>
				<span class='text'>}Mach's positivism also influenced many Russian [[Marxist]]s, such as [[Alexander Bogdanov]] (1873–1928)</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1908, [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] wrote a philosophical work, ''[[Materialism and Empirio-criticism]]'' (published 1909), in which he criticized Machism and the views of &quot;Russian Machists&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Empirio-criticism is the term for the rigorously positivist and radically empirical philosophy established by the German philosopher [[Richard Avenarius]] and further developed by Mach, which claims that all we can know is our sensations and that knowledge should be confined to pure experience (see [http://www</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In accordance with this philosophy, Mach opposed Ludwig Boltzmann and others who proposed an [[atomic theory]] of physics</span>
				<span class='text'>Since one cannot observe things as small as atoms directly, and since no atomic model at the time was consistent, the atomic hypothesis seemed to Mach to be unwarranted, and perhaps not sufficiently &quot;economical&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Mach had a direct influence on the [[Vienna Circle]] philosophers and the school of [[logical positivism]] in general</span>
				<span class='text'>ach is attributed with a number of principles that distill his ideal of physical theorisation — what is now called &quot;Machian physics&quot;:# It should be based entirely on directly observable phenomena (in line with his positivistic leanings)&lt;ref&gt;[[Julian Barbour|Barbour, J</span>
				<span class='text'>] ''The End of Time'', p220: &quot;In the Machian view, the properties of the system are exhausted by the masses of the particles and their separations, but the separations are mutual properties</span>
				<span class='text'>Apart from the masses, the particles have no attributes that are exclusively their own</span>
				<span class='text'>They – in the form of a triangle – are a single thing</span>
				<span class='text'>In the Newtonian view, the particles exist in absolute space and time</span>
				<span class='text'>These external elements lend the particles attributes – position, momentum, angular momentum – denied in the Machian view</span>
				<span class='text'>The particles become three things</span>
				<span class='text'>Absolute space and time are an essential part of atomism</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt;# It should completely eschew [[absolute space and time]] in favor of [[relative motion]]&lt;ref&gt;Penrose, R</span>
				<span class='text'>''The Road to Reality'', p753: &quot;Mach’s principle asserts thatphysics should be defined entirely in terms of the relation of one body toanother, and that the very notion of a background space should beabandoned&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;# Any phenomena that would seem attributable to absolute space and time  (e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>[[inertia]], and [[centrifugal force]]) should instead be seen as emerging from the large scale distribution of matter in the universe</span>

				<span class='text'> There will hover before him as an ideal insight into the principles of the whole matter, from which accelerated and inertial motions will result in the same way</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The last is singled out, particularly by [[Albert Einstein]] as &quot;the&quot; [[Mach's principle]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Einstein cited it as one of the three principles underlying [[general relativity]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1930, he stated that &quot;it is justified to consider Mach as the precursor of the general theory of relativity&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Pais , ''Subtle is the Lord'', 2005, OUP&lt;/ref&gt; though Mach, before his death, would reject Einstein's theory</span>
