				<span class='text'>Courier Dover Publications</span>
				<span class='text'>ISBN 0-486-20645-9</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; a treatise written in [[Latin]] on architecture, dedicated to the emperor Augustus</span>
				<span class='text'>In the preface of Book I, Vitruvius dedicates his writings so as to give personal knowledge of the quality of buildings to the emperor</span>
				<span class='text'>Likely Vitruvius is referring to [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa#Life in public service|Marcus Agrippa]]'s campaign of public repairs and improvements</span>
				<span class='text'>This work is the only surviving major book on architecture from [[classical antiquity]]</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Petri Liukkonen, this text &quot;influenced deeply from the [[Early Renaissance]] onwards artists, thinkers, and architects, among them [[Leon Battista Alberti]] (1404–1472), [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519), and [[Michelangelo]] (1475–1564)</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bandw&quot;/&gt; The next major book on architecture, [[Leone Battista Alberti|Alberti's]] reformulation of ''Ten Books'', was not written until 1452</span>
				<span class='text'>itruvius is famous for asserting in his book ''De architectura'' that a structure must exhibit the three qualities of ''firmitas, utilitas, venustas'' – that is, it must be solid, useful, beautiful</span>
				<span class='text'>These are sometimes termed the '''Vitruvian virtues''' or the '''Vitruvian Triad'''</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Vitruvius, architecture is an imitation of nature</span>
				<span class='text'>As birds and bees built their nests, so humans constructed housing from natural materials, that gave them shelter against the elements</span>
				<span class='text'>When perfecting this art of building, the Greeks invented the architectural orders: [[Doric order|Doric]], [[Ionic order|Ionic]] and [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It gave them a sense of proportion, culminating in understanding the proportions of the greatest work of art: the human body</span>
				<span class='text'>This led Vitruvius in defining his [[Vitruvian Man]], as drawn later by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]: the human body inscribed in the circle and the square (the fundamental geometric patterns of the cosmic order)</span>
				<span class='text'>itruvius is sometimes loosely referred to as the first architect, but it is more accurate to describe him as the first Roman architect to have written surviving records of his field</span>
				<span class='text'>He himself cites older but less complete works</span>
				<span class='text'>He was less an original thinker or creative intellect than a codifier of existing architectural practice</span>
				<span class='text'>It should also be noted that Vitruvius had a much wider scope than modern architects</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Roman architecture|Roman architects]] practised a wide variety of disciplines; in modern terms, they could be described as being engineers, architects, [[landscape architects]], artists, and [[Artisan|craftsmen]] combined</span>
				<span class='text'>Etymologically the word architect derives from Greek words meaning 'master' and 'builder'</span>
				<span class='text'>The first of the ''Ten Books'' deals with many subjects which now come within the scope of [[landscape architecture]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Roman technology==[[File:Archscrew2</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|200px|Drainage wheel from [[Rio Tinto (river)|Rio Tinto]] mines]]Books VIII, IX and X form the basis of much of what we know about Roman technology, now augmented by archaeological studies of extant remains, such as the [[water mill]]s at [[Barbegal]] in France</span>
				<span class='text'>The other major source of information is the ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'' compiled by [[Pliny the Elder]] much later in c</span>
				<span class='text'>75 AD</span>
				<span class='text'>==Machines===The work is important for its descriptions of the many different machines used for engineering structures such as [[Hoist (device)|hoists]], [[Crane (machine)|cranes]] and [[pulley]]s, as well as war machines such as [[catapult]]s, ''[[ballistae]],'' and [[siege engine]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>As a practising engineer, Vitruvius must be speaking from personal experience rather than simply describing the works of others</span>
				<span class='text'>He also describes the construction of [[sundials]] and [[water clocks]], and the use of an [[aeolipile]] (the first [[steam engine]]) as an experiment to demonstrate the nature of atmospheric air movements (wind)</span>
				<span class='text'>==Aqueducts===His description of [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]] construction includes the way they are surveyed, and the careful choice of materials needed, although [[Frontinus]] (a general who was appointed in the late 1st century AD to administer the many aqueducts of Rome), writing a century later, gives much more detail of the practical problems involved in their construction and maintenance</span>
				<span class='text'>Surely Vitruvius' book would have been of great assistance in this</span>
				<span class='text'>Vitruvius was writing in the 1st century BC when many of the finest [[Roman aqueducts]] were built, and survive to this day, such as those at [[Segovia]] and the [[Pont du Gard]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The use of the [[inverted siphon]] is described in detail, together with the problems of high pressures developed in the pipe at the base of the siphon, a practical problem with which he seems to be acquainted</span>
				<span class='text'>==Materials===He describes many different [[construction material]]s used for a wide variety of different structures, as well as such details as [[stucco]] painting</span>
				<span class='text'>Concrete and [[Lime (material)|lime]] receive in-depth descriptions, the longevity of many Roman structures being mute testimony to the Romans' skill in building materials and design</span>
				<span class='text'>itruvius is well known and often cited as one of the earliest surviving sources to have advised that lead should not be used to conduct drinking water, recommending clay pipes or masonry channels</span>
				<span class='text'>He comes to this conclusion in Book VIII of ''De Architectura'' after empirical observation of the apparent [[laborer]] illnesses in the lead foundries of his time</span>

				<span class='text'>It was a device widely used for raising water to irrigate fields and drain mines</span>
				<span class='text'>Other lifting machines he mentions include the endless chain of buckets and the [[reverse overshot water-wheel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Remains of the water wheels used for lifting water were discovered when old mines were re-opened at [[Rio Tinto (river)|Rio Tinto]] in Spain, [[Rosia Montana]] in Romania and [[Dolaucothi]] in west [[Wales]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Rio Tinto wheel is now shown in the [[British Museum]], and the Dolaucothi specimen in the [[National Museum of Wales]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==Surveying instruments===That he must have been well practised in surveying is shown by his descriptions of surveying instruments, especially the water level or ''[[chorobates]],'' which he compares favourably with the ''[[Groma surveying|groma]],'' a device using [[plumb line]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>They were essential in all building operations, but especially in aqueduct construction, where a uniform gradient was important to the provision of a regular supply of water without damage to the walls of the channel</span>
				<span class='text'>He also developed one of the first [[odometer]]s, consisting of a wheel of known circumference that dropped a pebble into a container on every rotation</span>
				<span class='text'>==Central heating===[[File:Hypocaustum</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|220px|Ruins of the hypocaust under the floor of a Roman villa</span>
				<span class='text'>The part under the [[exedra]] is covered</span>
				<span class='text'>]He describes the many innovations made in building design to improve the living conditions of the inhabitants</span>
				<span class='text'>Foremost among them is the development of the ''[[hypocaust]],'' a type of [[central heating]] where hot air developed by a fire was channelled under the floor and inside the walls of [[public bath]]s and [[villa]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>He gives explicit instructions how to design such buildings so that [[fuel efficiency]] is maximised, so that for example, the ''[[caldarium]]'' is next to the ''[[tepidarium]]'' followed by the ''[[frigidarium]]</span>
				<span class='text'>' He also advises on using a type of regulator to control the heat in the hot rooms, a [[bronze]] disc set into the roof under a circular aperture which could be raised or lowered by a [[pulley]] to adjust the ventilation</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he does not suggest it himself, it is likely that his dewatering devices such as the [[reverse overshot water-wheel]] was used in the larger baths to lift water to header tanks at the top of the larger ''thermae'', such as the [[Baths of Diocletian]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The one which was used in Bath of Caracalla for grinding flour</span>
				<span class='text'>=Lists of names given in Book VII Introduction==In book seven's introduction Vitruvius goes to great lengths to present why he is qualified to write ''De Architectura''</span>
				<span class='text'>This is the only location in the book where Vitruvius specifically addresses his personal breadth of knowledge</span>
				<span class='text'>Similar to a modern reference section, the author's position as one who is knowledgeable and educated is established</span>
				<span class='text'>The topics range across many fields of expertise reflecting that in Roman times as today construction is a diverse field</span>
				<span class='text'>Vitruvius is clearly a well-read man</span>
				<span class='text'>n addition to providing his qualification, Vitruvius summarizes a recurring theme throughout the 10 books, a non-trivial and core contribution of his treatise outside simply a construction book</span>
				<span class='text'>Vitruvius makes the point that the work of some of the most talented are unknown, while many who are of lesser talent but greater political position are famous</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Vitruvius, Pollio 1960&quot;/&gt; This theme runs through Vitruvius’s ten books repeatedly - echoing an implicit prediction that his works and himself will also be unknown</span>
				<span class='text'>Which was true for over a thousand years after he completed the 10 books</span>
				<span class='text'>itruvius illustrates this point by naming what he considers are the most talented individuals in history</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Vitruvius, Pollio 1960&quot;/&gt; Implicitly challenging the reader that they have never heard of some of these people</span>
				<span class='text'>Vitruvius goes on and predicts that some of these individuals will be forgotten and their works will be [[lost works|lost]]</span>
				<span class='text'>While other less deserving political characters of history will be forever remembered with pageantry - again an non-trivial claim when we remember that this is the builder of Julius Caesar's war machines and fortifications; the inclusion of this list is important to illustrate the truth of Vitruvius's claim and should not be removed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;!--Italicized names below, which show as red links as of July 29, 2015 (and perhaps others which were red links when this sentence was first written) do not have a Wikipedia page as of July 29, 2015 and, outside of inclusion on Vitruvius’s list under a categorization, nothing is known of them</span>
				<span class='text'>Ironically, they may be unknown because the ancient [[Library of Alexandria]] was accidentally burned in 48 BC during a siege by Julius Caesar</span>
				<span class='text'>Vitruvius does not mention the architecture of Egypt so was probably not involved in this siege</span>
				<span class='text'> Further, some of the non-italicized names which show as blue links as of July 29, 2015 have articles in Wikipedia that are Wikipedia &quot;stubs&quot; based on Vitruvius's list and short narratives</span>
				<span class='text'> Also, as of July 29, 2015, five of the following non-italicized names have links going to Wikipedia disambiguation pages;&lt;ref&gt;The five links that go to disambiguation pages as of July 29, 2015 are [[Attalus (disambiguation)|Attalus]], [[Pythis (disambiguation)|Pytheos]], [[Timotheos (disambiguation)|Timotheos]], [[Demophilus (disambiguation)|Demophilus]], and [[Leonidas (disambiguation)|Leonidas]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; for these ones it is not clear whether the Wikipedia collective of authors have information about the persons meant by Vitruvius or not</span>
