				<span class='text'>Cleese met Gilliam in [[New York City]] while on tour with the [[Footlights|Cambridge University Footlights]] [[revue]] ''[[Cambridge Footlights Revue|Cambridge Circus]]'' (originally entitled ''A Clump of Plinths'')</span>
				<span class='text'>Chapman, Cleese, and Idle were members of the Footlights, which at that time also included the future ''[[The Goodies|Goodies]]'' ([[Tim Brooke-Taylor]], [[Bill Oddie]], and [[Graeme Garden]]), and [[Jonathan Lynn]] (co-writer of ''[[Yes Minister]]'' and ''[[Yes Minister|Yes, Prime Minister]]'')</span>
				<span class='text'>During Idle's presidency of the club, feminist writer [[Germaine Greer]] and broadcaster [[Clive James]] were members</span>
				<span class='text'>Recordings of Footlights' revues (called &quot;Smokers&quot;) at [[Pembroke College, Cambridge|Pembroke College]] include sketches and performances by Cleese and Idle, which, along with tapes of Idle's performances in some of the drama society's theatrical productions, are kept in the archives of the [[Pembroke Players]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ll six Python members appeared in or wrote these shows before ''Flying Circus'':*''[[I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again]]'' (radio) (1964–1973) [Cleese: cast member and writer] – [Idle and Chapman: writers]*''[[The Frost Report]]'' (1966–1967) [Cleese: cast member and writer] – [Idle: writer of Frost's monologues] – [Chapman, Palin and Jones: writers]*''[[At Last the 1948 Show]]'' (1967) [Chapman and Cleese: writers and cast members] – [Idle: writer]*''[[Twice a Fortnight]]'' (1967) [Palin and Jones: cast members and writers]*''[[Do Not Adjust Your Set]]'' (1967–1969) [Idle, Jones, and Palin: cast members and writers] – [Gilliam: animation] &lt;br /&gt;— [[Bonzo Dog Band]]: musical interludes]*''[[We Have Ways of Making You Laugh (TV series)|We Have Ways of Making You Laugh]]'' (1968) [Idle: cast member and writer] – [Gilliam: animation]*''[[How To Irritate People]]'' (1968) [Cleese and Chapman: cast members &amp; writers] – [Palin: cast member]*''[[The Complete and Utter History of Britain]]'' (1969) [Palin and Jones: cast members and writers]*''[[Doctor in the House (TV series)|Doctor in the House]]'' (1969) [Cleese and Chapman: writers]''[[The Frost Report]]'' is credited as first uniting the British Pythons and providing an environment in which they could develop their particular styles</span>
				<span class='text'>everal other important British comedy writers or future performers who were featured included [[Marty Feldman]], [[Jonathan Lynn]], [[David Jason]], and [[David Frost]], as well as members of other future comedy teams such as [[Ronnie Corbett]] and [[Ronnie Barker]] ([[the Two Ronnies]]), and [[Tim Brooke-Taylor]], [[Graeme Garden]], and [[Bill Oddie]] ([[the Goodies]])</span>
				<span class='text'>ollowing the success of ''Do Not Adjust Your Set'',  a tea-time children's programme, [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] offered Gilliam, Idle, Jones, and Palin their own late-night adult comedy series together</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time, Chapman and Cleese were offered a show by the BBC, which had been impressed by their work on ''The Frost Report'' and ''At Last the 1948 Show''</span>
				<span class='text'>Cleese was reluctant to do a [[Double act|two-man show]] for various reasons, including Chapman's supposedly difficult and erratic personality</span>
				<span class='text'>Cleese had fond memories of working with Palin on ''[[How To Irritate People]]'' and invited him to join the team</span>
				<span class='text'>With no studio available at ITV until summer 1970 for the late-night show, Palin agreed to join Cleese and Chapman, and suggested the involvement of his writing partner Jones and colleague Idle—who in turn wanted Gilliam to provide animations for the projected series</span>
				<span class='text'>Much has been made of the fact that the Monty Python troupe is the result of Cleese's desire to work with Palin and the chance circumstances that brought the other four members into the fold</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;''The Pythons Autobiography By The Pythons''—Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Michael Palin, John Chapman, David Sherlock, Bob McCabe—Thomas Dunne Books; Orion, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;By contrast, according to John Cleese's autobiography,&lt;ref&gt;''So, Anyway </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>' by John Cleese; Crown Archetype, London, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; the origins of ''Monty Python'' lay in the admiration that writing partners Cleese and Chapman had for the new type of comedy being done on ''Do Not Adjust Your Set''; as a result, a meeting was initiated by Cleese between Chapman, Idle, Jones, Palin, and himself at which it was agreed to pool their writing and performing efforts and jointly seek production sponsorship</span>
				<span class='text'>=''Monty Python's Flying Circus''=={{Main|Monty Python's Flying Circus}}===Development of the series===The Pythons had a definite idea about what they wanted to do with the series</span>
				<span class='text'>They were admirers of the work of [[Peter Cook]], [[Alan Bennett]], [[Jonathan Miller]], and [[Dudley Moore]] on ''[[Beyond the Fringe]]'', and had worked on ''Frost'', which was similar in style</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>But Also]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>One problem the Pythons perceived with these programmes was that though the body of the sketch would be strong, the writers would often struggle to then find a punchline funny enough to end on, and this would detract from the overall sketch quality</span>
				<span class='text'>They decided that they would simply not bother to &quot;cap&quot; their sketches in the traditional manner, and early episodes of the ''Flying Circus'' series make great play of this abandonment of the punchline (one scene has Cleese turn to Idle, as the sketch descends into chaos, and remark that &quot;This is the silliest sketch I've ever been in&quot;—they all resolve not to carry on and simply walk off the set)</span>

				<span class='text'>et</span>
				<span class='text'>Retrieved 23 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt; However, as they began assembling material for the show, the Pythons watched one of their collective heroes, [[Spike Milligan]], recording his groundbreaking series ''[[Q (TV series)|Q5]]'' (1969)</span>
				<span class='text'>Not only was the programme more irreverent and anarchic than any previous television comedy, but Milligan also would often &quot;give up&quot; on sketches halfway through and wander off set (often muttering &quot;Did I write this?&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>It was clear that their new series would now seem less original, and Jones in particular became determined the Pythons should innovate</span>
				<span class='text'>fter much debate, Jones remembered an animation Gilliam had created for ''Do Not Adjust Your Set'' called &quot;Beware of the Elephants&quot;, which had intrigued him with its stream-of-consciousness style</span>
				<span class='text'>Jones felt it would be a good concept to apply to the series: allowing sketches to blend into one another</span>
				<span class='text'>Palin had been equally fascinated by another of Gilliam's efforts, entitled &quot;Christmas Cards&quot;, and agreed that it represented &quot;a way of doing things differently&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Since Cleese, Chapman, and Idle were less concerned with the overall flow of the programme, Jones, Palin, and Gilliam became largely responsible for the presentation style of the ''Flying Circus'' series, in which disparate sketches are linked to give each episode the appearance of a single stream-of-consciousness (often using a Gilliam animation to move from the closing image of one sketch to the opening scene of another)</span>
				<span class='text'>riting started at 9&amp;nbsp;am and finished at 5&amp;nbsp;pm</span>
				<span class='text'>Typically, Cleese and Chapman worked as one pair isolated from the others, as did Jones and Palin, while Idle wrote alone</span>
				<span class='text'>After a few days, they would join together with Gilliam, critique their scripts, and exchange ideas</span>
				<span class='text'>Their approach to writing was democratic</span>
				<span class='text'>If the majority found an idea humorous, it was included in the show</span>
				<span class='text'>The casting of roles for the sketches was a similarly unselfish process, since each member viewed himself primarily as a &quot;writer&quot;, rather than an actor eager for screen time</span>
				<span class='text'>When the themes for sketches were chosen, Gilliam had a free hand in bridging them with animations, using a camera, scissors, and airbrush</span>
				<span class='text'>hile the show was a collaborative process, different factions within Python were responsible for elements of the team's humour</span>
				<span class='text'>In general, the work of the Oxford-educated members (Jones and Palin) was more visual, and more fanciful conceptually (e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> the arrival of the [[Spanish Inquisition]] in a suburban front room), while the Cambridge graduates' sketches tended to be more verbal and more aggressive (for example, Cleese and Chapman's many &quot;confrontation&quot; sketches, where one character intimidates or hurls abuse, or Idle's characters with bizarre verbal quirks, such as &quot;The Man Who Speaks In [[Anagram]]s&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>Cleese confirmed that &quot;most of the sketches with heavy abuse were Graham's and mine, anything that started with a slow pan across countryside and impressive music was Mike and Terry's, and anything that got utterly involved with words and disappeared up any personal orifice was Eric's&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wilmut (1980), p</span>
				<span class='text'>11&lt;/ref&gt; Gilliam's animations, meanwhile, ranged from the whimsical to the savage (the cartoon format allowing him to create some astonishingly violent scenes without fear of censorship)</span>
				<span class='text'>everal names for the show were considered before ''Monty Python's Flying Circus'' was settled upon</span>
				<span class='text'>Some were ''Owl Stretching Time'', ''The Toad Elevating Moment'', ''A Horse, a Spoon and a Bucket'', ''Vaseline Review'', and ''Bun, Wackett, Buzzard, Stubble and Boot''</span>
				<span class='text'>''Flying Circus'' stuck when the BBC explained it had printed that name in its schedules and was not prepared to amend it</span>
				<span class='text'>Many variations on the name in front of this title then came and went (popular legend holds that the BBC considered ''Monty Python's Flying Circus'' to be a ridiculous name, at which point the group threatened to change their name every week until the BBC relented)</span>
				<span class='text'>''Gwen Dibley's Flying Circus'' was named after a woman Palin had read about in the newspaper, thinking it would be amusing if she were to discover she had her own TV show</span>
				<span class='text'>''Baron Von Took's Flying Circus'' was considered as an affectionate tribute to [[Barry Took]], the man who had brought them together</span>
				<span class='text'>''Arthur Megapode's Flying Circus'' was suggested, then discarded</span>
				<span class='text'>The name ''Baron Von Took's Flying Circus'' had the form of ''[[Baron Manfred von Richthofen]]'s [[Manfred von Richthofen#Flying Circus|Flying Circus]]'' of WWI fame, and the new group was forming in a time when the [[Royal Guardsmen]]'s 1966 song &quot;[[Snoopy vs</span>
				<span class='text'>the Red Baron (song)|Snoopy vs</span>
				<span class='text'>the Red Baron]]&quot; had peaked</span>
				<span class='text'>The term 'flying circus' was also another name for the popular entertainment of the 1920s known as [[flying circus|barnstorming]], where multiple performers collaborated with their stunts to perform a combined set of acts</span>
				<span class='text'>iffering, somewhat confusing accounts are given of the origins of the Python name, although the members agree that its only &quot;significance&quot; was that they thought it sounded funny</span>
				<span class='text'>In the 1998 documentary ''Live At Aspen'' during the [[The Comedy Festival|US Comedy Arts Festival]], where the troupe was awarded the AFI Star Award by the [[American Film Institute]], the group implied that &quot;Monty&quot; was selected ([[Eric Idle]]'s idea) as a gently mocking tribute to [[Field Marshal]] [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Lord Montgomery]], a legendary British general of [[World War II]]; requiring a &quot;slippery-sounding&quot; surname, they settled on &quot;Python&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>On other occasions, Idle has claimed that the name &quot;Monty&quot; was that of a popular and rotund fellow who drank in his local pub; people would often walk in and ask the barman, &quot;Has Monty been in yet?&quot;, forcing the name to become stuck in his mind</span>
				<span class='text'>The name Monty Python was later described by the BBC as being &quot;envisaged by the team as the perfect name for a sleazy entertainment agent&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>html |title=BBC – Comedy – Monty Python}}&lt;/ref&gt;===Style of the show===''Flying Circus'' popularised innovative formal techniques, such as the [[cold open]], in which an episode began without the traditional opening titles or announcements</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=MBC_piece&gt;{{cite web | last = Museum of Broadcast Communications | title = Monty Python's Flying Circus | url = http://www</span>
				<span class='text'>useum</span>
				<span class='text'>v/archives/etv/M/htmlM/montypython/montypython</span>
				<span class='text'>tm }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is the &quot;It's&quot; man: Palin, outfitted in [[Robinson Crusoe]] garb, making a tortuous journey across various terrains, before finally approaching the camera to state, &quot;It's&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot;, only to be then cut off by the [[title sequence]] and theme music</span>
				<span class='text'>n several occasions, the cold open lasted until mid-show, after which the regular opening titles ran</span>
				<span class='text'>Occasionally, the Pythons tricked viewers by rolling the [[closing credits]] halfway through the show, usually continuing the joke by fading to the familiar [[History of BBC television idents|globe logo]] used for BBC continuity, over which Cleese would parody the clipped tones of a BBC announcer</span>
				<span class='text'>On one occasion, the credits ran directly after the opening titles</span>
				<span class='text'>ecause of their dislike of finishing with punchlines, they experimented with ending the sketches by cutting abruptly to another scene or animation, walking offstage, addressing the camera (breaking the [[fourth wall]]), or introducing a totally unrelated event or character</span>
				<span class='text'>A classic example of this approach was the use of Chapman's &quot;anti-silliness&quot; character of &quot;the Colonel&quot;, who walked into several sketches and ordered them to be stopped because things were becoming &quot;far too silly&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Monty python foot</span>
				<span class='text'>ng|thumb|right|230px|Cupid's foot, as used by ''Monty Python's Flying Circus'']]Another favourite way of ending sketches was to drop a cartoonish &quot;16-ton weight&quot; prop on one of the characters when the sketch seemed to be losing momentum, or a knight in full armour (played by [[Terry Gilliam]]) would wander on-set and hit characters over the head with a rubber chicken,&lt;ref&gt;''Monty Python's Flying Circus Just The Words'' Volume 1, p33</span>
				<span class='text'>Methuen, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; before cutting to the next scene</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet another way of changing scenes was when John Cleese, usually outfitted in a dinner suit, would come in as a radio commentator and, in a rather pompous manner, make the formal and determined announcement &quot;And now for something completely different</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;, which later became the title of [[And Now For Something Completely Different|the first Monty Python film]]</span>
				<span class='text'>he Python theme music is ''[[Liberty Bell (march)|The Liberty Bell]]'', a march by [[John Philip Sousa]], which was chosen, among other reasons, because the recording was in the [[public domain]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;MBC_piece&quot;/&gt;The use of Gilliam's [[Surrealism|surreal]], [[collage]] [[stop motion]] animations was another innovative intertextual element of the Python style</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of the images Gilliam used were lifted from famous works of art, and from [[Victorian era|Victorian]] illustrations and [[engraving]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>The giant foot which crushes the show's title at the end of the opening credits is in fact the foot of [[Cupid]], cut from a reproduction of the [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance]] masterpiece ''[[Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time]]'' by [[Bronzino]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This foot, and Gilliam's style in general, are [[trademark look|visual trademarks]] of the programme</span>
				<span class='text'>he Pythons used the British tradition of [[cross-dressing]] comedy by donning frocks and makeup and playing female roles themselves while speaking in [[falsetto]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Jones specialized in playing the working-class housewife, with Palin and Idle in being generally more posh</span>
				<span class='text'>The other members played female roles more sparsely</span>
				<span class='text'>Generally speaking, female roles were played by women only when the scene specifically required that the character be sexually attractive (although sometimes they used Idle for this)</span>
				<span class='text'>The troupe later turned to [[Carol Cleveland]], who co-starred in numerous episodes after 1970</span>
				<span class='text'>In some episodes and later in ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]'', they took the idea one step further by playing women who impersonated men (in the stoning scene)</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;FlyingCircusCanada&quot; /&gt;  The CBC dropped the show when it returned to regular programming after the Christmas 1970 break, choosing to not place the remaining seven episodes of series 2 on the January 1971 CBC schedule</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;FlyingCircusCanada&quot; /&gt;  Within a week, the CBC received hundreds of calls complaining of the cancellation, and more than 100 people staged a demonstration at the CBC's [[Montreal]] studios</span>
				<span class='text'>The show eventually returned, becoming a fixture on the network during the first half of the 1970s</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;FlyingCircusCanada&quot; /&gt;[[Time-Life Films]] had the rights to distribute all BBC-TV programmes in the [[United States]]; however, they decided that British comedy simply would not work in America, so it would not be worth the investment to convert the Python episodes from the European [[PAL]] standard to the American [[NTSC]] standard</span>
				<span class='text'>ketches from Monty Python's Flying Circus were introduced to American audiences in [[And Now for Something Completely Different#American audiences|August 1972]], with the release of the Python movie ''[[And Now for Something Completely Different]]'', featuring sketches from series 1 and 2 of the television show</span>
				<span class='text'> This 1972 release met limited box office success</span>
				<span class='text'>Sketches like &quot;Bicycle Repairman&quot; and &quot;The Dull Life of a Stockbroker&quot; aired in the summer of 1972 on ''Comedyworld'', a summer replacement series for NBC's ''The Dean Martin Show''</span>
				<span class='text'>n the summer of 1974, Ron Devillier, the programme director for nonprofit [[PBS]] television station [[KERA-TV|KERA]] in [[Dallas|Dallas, Texas]], started airing episodes of ''Monty Python's Flying Circus''</span>
				<span class='text'>Ratings shot through the roof, providing an encouraging sign to the other 100 PBS stations that had signed up to begin airing the show in October 1974—exactly five years after their BBC debut</span>
				<span class='text'> There was also cross-promotion from [[FM Radio|FM radio]] stations across the country, whose airing of tracks from the Python LPs had already introduced American audiences to this bizarre brand of comedy</span>
				<span class='text'> The popularity on PBS resulted in the 1974 re-release of the 1972 ''</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;Completely Different'' movie, with much greater box office success</span>
				<span class='text'>he ability to show ''Monty Python's Flying Circus'' under the American NTSC standard had been made possible by the commercial actions of American television producer [[Greg Garrison]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Garrison produced the NBC series ''[[The Dean Martin Comedy World]]'', which ran during the summer of 1974</span>
				<span class='text'> The concept was to show clips from comedy shows produced in other countries, including tape of the Python sketches &quot;Bicycle Repairman&quot; and &quot;The Dull Life of a Stockbroker&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Payment for use of these two sketches was enough to allow Time-Life Films to convert the entire Python library to NTSC standard, allowing for the sale to the PBS network stations which then brought the entire show to US audiences</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1975, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] broadcast two 90-minute ''Monty Python'' specials, each with three shows, but cut out a total of 24 minutes from each, in part to make time for commercials,and  in part to avoid upsetting their audience</span>
				<span class='text'> As the judge observed in ''[[Gilliam v</span>
				<span class='text'>American Broadcasting Companies, Inc</span>
				<span class='text'>]'', where Monty Python sued for damages caused by broadcast of the mutilated version, &quot;According to the network, appellants should have anticipated that most of the excised material contained scatological references inappropriate for American television and that these scenes would be replaced with commercials, which presumably are more palatable to the American public</span>

				<span class='text'>He later explained that he felt he no longer had anything fresh to offer the show, and claimed that only two Cleese- and Chapman-penned sketches in the third series (&quot;Dennis Moore&quot; and the &quot;Cheese Shop&quot;) were truly original, and that the others were bits and pieces from previous work cobbled together in slightly different contexts</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt; He was also finding Chapman, who was at that point in the full throes of alcoholism, difficult to work with</span>

				<span class='text'>The name ''Monty Python's Flying Circus'' appears in the opening animation for series four, but in the end credits, the show is listed as simply &quot;Monty Python&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Cleese left the show, he was credited as a writer for three of the six episodes, largely concentrated in the &quot;Michael Ellis&quot; episode, which had begun life as one of the many drafts of the &quot;Holy Grail&quot; motion picture</span>
				<span class='text'> When a new direction for &quot;Grail&quot; was decided upon, the subplot of Arthur and his knights wandering around a strange department store in modern times was lifted out and recycled as the aforementioned TV episode</span>
				<span class='text'>hile the first three series contained 13 episodes each, the fourth ended after just six</span>
				<span class='text'> Extremely keen to keep the now massively popular show going, the BBC had offered the troupe a full 13 episodes, but the truncated troupe (now under the unspoken 'leadership' of Terry Jones) had come to a common agreement while writing the fourth series that there was only enough material, and more importantly only enough enthusiasm, to shoot the six that were made</span>
				<span class='text'>=Life after the ''Flying Circus''=====Filmography=======''And Now for Something Completely Different'' (1971)===={{Main|And Now for Something Completely Different}}The Pythons' first feature film was directed by [[Ian MacNaughton]], reprising his role from the television series</span>
				<span class='text'>It was composed of sketches from the first two seasons of the ''Flying Circus'', reshot on a low budget (and often slightly edited) for cinema release</span>
				<span class='text'>Material selected for the film includes: &quot;Dead Parrot&quot;, &quot;The Lumberjack Song&quot;, &quot;[[Upper Class Twit of the Year]]&quot;, &quot;Hell's Grannies&quot;&lt;!-- DON'T WIKILINK - IT'S JUST A REDIRECT TO THE MP TELEVISION SHOW --&gt;, &quot;Self-Defence Class&quot;, &quot;[[How Not To Be Seen]]&quot;, and &quot;Nudge Nudge&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Financed by ''[[Playboy]]'''s UK executive [[Victor Lownes]], it was intended as a way of breaking Monty Python into America, and although it was ultimately unsuccessful in this, the film did good business in the UK, this being in the era before home video would make the original material much more accessible</span>
				<span class='text'>The group did not consider the film a success</span>
				<span class='text'>===''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' (1975)===={{Main|Monty Python and the Holy Grail}}In 1974, between production on the third and fourth seasons, the group decided to embark on their first &quot;proper&quot; feature film, containing entirely new material</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' was based on [[King Arthur|Arthurian legend]] and was directed by Jones and Gilliam</span>
				<span class='text'>Again, the latter also contributed linking animations (and put together the opening credits)</span>
				<span class='text'>Along with the rest of the Pythons, Jones and Gilliam performed several roles in the film, but  Chapman took the lead as King Arthur</span>
				<span class='text'>Cleese returned to the group for the film, feeling that the group were once again breaking new ground</span>
				<span class='text'>''Holy Grail'' was filmed on location, in picturesque rural areas of Scotland, with a budget of only £229,000; the money was raised in part with investments from rock groups such as [[Pink Floyd]], [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], and [[Led Zeppelin]]—and UK music industry entrepreneur [[Tony Stratton-Smith]] (founder and owner of the [[Charisma Records]] label, for which the Pythons recorded their comedy albums)</span>
				<span class='text'>he backers of the film wanted to cut the famous [[Black Knight (Monty Python)|Black Knight]] scene (in which the Black Knight loses his limbs in a duel), but it was eventually kept in the movie</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Interview with John Cleese on Q-The Podcast with host John Ghomeshi, on 16 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;====''Monty Python's Life of Brian'' (1979)===={{Main|Monty Python's Life of Brian}}Following the success of ''Holy Grail'', reporters asked for the title of the next Python film, despite the fact that the team had not even begun to consider a third one</span>
				<span class='text'>Eventually, Idle flippantly replied &quot;Jesus Christ – Lust for Glory&quot;, which became the group's stock answer once they realised that it shut reporters up</span>
				<span class='text'>However, they soon began to seriously consider a film lampooning the [[New Testament]] era in the same way ''Holy Grail'' had lampooned Arthurian legend</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite them all sharing a distrust of organised religion, they agreed not to mock Jesus or his teachings directly</span>
				<span class='text'>They also mentioned that they could not think of anything legitimate to make fun of about him</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, they decided to write a satire on credulity and hypocrisy among the followers of someone who had been mistaken for the &quot;Messiah&quot;, but who had no desire to be followed as such</span>
				<span class='text'>Chapman was cast in the lead role of Brian</span>
				<span class='text'>he focus therefore shifted to a separate individual born at the same time, in a neighbouring stable</span>
				<span class='text'>When Jesus appears in the film (first, as a baby in the stable, and then later on [[Mount of Olives|the Mount]], speaking the [[Beatitudes]]), he is played straight (by actor [[Kenneth Colley]]) and portrayed with respect</span>
				<span class='text'>The comedy begins when members of the crowd mishear his statements of peace, love, and tolerance</span>
				<span class='text'>(&quot;I think he said, 'Blessed are the cheesemakers</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;)Directing duties were handled solely by Jones, having amicably agreed with Gilliam that Jones' approach to film-making was better suited for Python's general performing style</span>
				<span class='text'>''Holy Grail's'' production had often been stilted by their differences behind the camera</span>
				<span class='text'>Gilliam again contributed two animated sequences (one being the opening credits) and took charge of set design</span>
				<span class='text'>The film was shot on location in [[Tunisia]], the finances being provided this time by former Beatle [[George Harrison]], who together with [[Denis O'Brien (producer)|Denis O'Brien]] formed the production company [[Handmade Films|Hand-Made Films]] for the movie</span>
				<span class='text'>Harrison had a cameo role as the 'owner of the Mount'</span>
				<span class='text'>espite its subject matter attracting controversy, particularly upon its initial release, it has (together with its predecessor) been ranked among the greatest comedy films</span>
				<span class='text'>A [[Channel 4]] poll in 2005 ranked ''Holy Grail'' in sixth place, with ''Life of Brian'' at the top</span>

				<span class='text'>The released film also incorporated footage from the German television specials (the inclusion of which gives Ian MacNaughton his first on-screen credit for Python since the end of ''Flying Circus'') and live performances of several songs from the troupe's then-current ''[[Monty Python's Contractual Obligation Album]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>===''Monty Python's The Meaning of Life'' (1983)===={{Main|Monty Python's The Meaning of Life}}Python's final film returned to something structurally closer to the style of ''Flying Circus''</span>
				<span class='text'>A series of sketches loosely follows the ages of man from birth to death</span>
				<span class='text'>Directed again by Jones solo, ''The Meaning of Life'' is embellished with some of Python's most bizarre and disturbing moments, as well as various elaborate musical numbers</span>
				<span class='text'>The film is by far their darkest work, containing a great deal of [[Black comedy|black humour]], garnished by some spectacular violence (including an operation to remove a [[liver]] from a living patient without [[anaesthetic]] and the morbidly obese Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Creosote exploding over several restaurant patrons)</span>
				<span class='text'>At the time of its release, the Pythons confessed their aim was to offend &quot;absolutely everyone&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>esides the opening credits and the fish sequence, Gilliam, by now an established live-action director, no longer wanted to produce any linking cartoons, offering instead to direct one sketch—&quot;[[The Crimson Permanent Assurance]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Under his helm, though, the segment grew so ambitious and tangential that it was cut from the movie and used as a supporting feature in its own right</span>
				<span class='text'>(Television screenings also use it as a prologue</span>
				<span class='text'> Crucially, this was the last project on which all six Pythons would collaborate, except for the 1989 compilation ''[[Parrot Sketch Not Included – 20 Years of Monty Python|Parrot Sketch Not Included]],'' where they are all seen sitting in a closet for four seconds</span>
				<span class='text'>This was the last time Chapman appeared on screen with the Pythons</span>
				<span class='text'>==''Secret Policeman's Ball'' benefit shows===Members of Python contributed their services to charitable endeavours and causes—sometimes as an ensemble, at other times as individuals</span>
				<span class='text'>The cause that has been the most frequent and consistent beneficiary has been the [[human rights]] work of [[Amnesty International]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Between 1976 and 1981, the troupe or its members appeared in four major [[Benefit concert|fund-raisers]] for Amnesty—known collectively as the ''[[The Secret Policeman's Balls|Secret Policeman's Ball]]'' shows—which were turned into multiple films, TV shows, videos, record albums, and books</span>
				<span class='text'>These benefit shows and their many spin-offs raised considerable sums of money for Amnesty, raised public and media awareness of the human rights cause, and influenced many other members of the entertainment community (especially rock musicians) to become involved in political and social issues</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian2012&quot;/&gt; Among the many musicians who have publicly attributed their activism—and the organisation of their own [[Benefit concert|benefit events]]—to the inspiration of the work in this field of Monty Python are [[U2]], [[Bob Geldof]], [[Pete Townshend]], and [[Sting (musician)|Sting]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Idle did not participate in the Amnesty shows</span>
				<span class='text'>Notwithstanding Idle's lack of participation, the other five members (together with &quot;Associate Pythons&quot; Carol Cleveland and [[Neil Innes]]) all appeared together in the first ''Secret Policeman's Ball'' benefit—the 1976 ''[[A Poke In The Eye (With A Sharp Stick)]]''—where they performed several Python sketches</span>
				<span class='text'>In this first show, they were collectively billed as ''Monty Python''</span>
				<span class='text'>([[Peter Cook]] deputised for the errant Idle in a courtroom sketch</span>
				<span class='text'> In the next three shows, the participating Python members performed many Python sketches, but were billed under their individual names rather than under the collective Python banner</span>
				<span class='text'>After a six-year break, Amnesty resumed producing ''Secret Policeman's Ball'' benefit shows in 1987 (sometimes with, and sometimes without, variants of the iconic title) and by 2006 had presented a total of 12 such shows</span>
				<span class='text'>The shows since 1987 have featured newer generations of British comedic performers, including many who have attributed their participation in the show to their desire to emulate the Python's pioneering work for Amnesty</span>
				<span class='text'>(Cleese and Palin made a brief cameo appearance in the 1989 Amnesty show; apart from that, the Pythons have not appeared in shows after the first four</span>
				<span class='text'>===Going solo===Each member has pursued various film, television, and stage projects since the break-up of the group, but often continued to work with one another</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of these collaborations were very successful, most notably ''[[A Fish Called Wanda]]'' (1988), written by Cleese, in which he starred along with Palin</span>
				<span class='text'>The pair also appeared in ''[[Time Bandits]]'' (1981), a film directed by Gilliam, who wrote it together with Palin</span>
				<span class='text'>Gilliam directed ''[[Jabberwocky (film)|Jabberwocky]]'' (1977), and also directed and co-wrote ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'' (1985), which featured Palin, and ''[[The Adventures of Baron Munchausen]]'' (1988), which featured Idle</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[Yellowbeard]]'' (1983) was co-written by Chapman and featured Chapman, Idle, and Cleese, as well as many other English comedians including Peter Cook, [[Spike Milligan]], and Marty Feldman</span>
				<span class='text'>alin and Jones wrote the comedic TV series ''[[Ripping Yarns]]'' (1976–79), starring Palin</span>
				<span class='text'>Jones also appeared in the pilot episode and Cleese appeared in a nonspeaking part in the episode &quot;Golden Gordon&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Jones' film ''[[Erik the Viking]]'' also has Cleese playing a small part</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1996, Terry Jones wrote and directed an adaptation of [[Kenneth Grahame]]'s novel ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>It featured four members of Monty Python: Jones as Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Toad, Idle as Ratty, Cleese as Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Toad's lawyer, and Palin as the Sun</span>
				<span class='text'>Gilliam was considered for the voice of the river</span>
				<span class='text'>n terms of numbers of productions, Cleese has the most prolific solo career, having appeared in 59 films, 22 TV shows or series (including ''[[Cheers]]'', ''[[3rd Rock from the Sun]]'', Q's assistant in the [[James Bond movies]], and ''[[Will &amp; Grace]]''), 23 direct-to-video productions, six video games, and a number of commercials</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1976, Idle directed music videos for George Harrison songs &quot;[[This Song]]&quot; and &quot;[[Crackerbox Palace]]&quot;, the latter of which also featured cameo appearances from Neil Innes and John Cleese</span>

				<span class='text'>The song had been revived by [[Simon Mayo]] on [[BBC Radio 1]], and was consequently released as a single that year</span>
				<span class='text'>The theatrical phenomenon of the Python musical ''[[Spamalot]]'' has made Idle the most financially successful of the troupe after Python</span>

				<span class='text'>n 9 October 1999, to commemorate 30 years since the first ''Flying Circus'' television broadcast, [[BBC Two|BBC2]] devoted an evening to Python programmes, including a documentary charting the history of the team, interspersed with new sketches by the Monty Python team filmed especially for the event</span>
				<span class='text'>The program appears, with a few omissions, on the DVD ''The Life of Python''</span>
				<span class='text'>Idle's involvement in the special is limited, yet the final sketch marks the only time since 1989 that all surviving members of the troupe appear in one sketch, albeit not in the same room</span>

				<span class='text'>Several shows were to be linked with Q&amp;A meetings in various cities</span>
				<span class='text'>Although all had said yes, Palin later changed his mind, much to the annoyance of Idle, who had begun work organising the tour</span>
				<span class='text'>This led to Idle refusing to take part in the new material shot for the BBC anniversary evening</span>
				<span class='text'>n 2002, four of the surviving members, bar Cleese, performed &quot;The Lumberjack Song&quot; and &quot;[[Sit on My Face]]&quot; for [[Concert for George|George Harrison's memorial concert]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The reunion also included regular supporting contributors Neil Innes and Carol Cleveland, with a special appearance from [[Tom Hanks]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n an interview to publicise the DVD release of ''The Meaning of Life'', Cleese said a further reunion was unlikely</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;It is absolutely impossible to get even a majority of us together in a room, and I'm not joking,&quot; Cleese said</span>
				<span class='text'>He said that the problem was one of busyness rather than one of bad feelings</span>

				<span class='text'>Cleese's feeling was that ''The Meaning of Life'' had been personally difficult and ultimately mediocre, and did not wish to be involved in another Python project for a variety of reasons (not least amongst them was the absence of Chapman, whose straight man-like central roles in the ''Grail'' and ''Brian'' films had been considered to be an essential anchoring performance)</span>
				<span class='text'>Apparently, Idle was angry with Cleese for refusing to do the film, which most of the remaining Pythons thought reasonably promising (the basic plot would have taken on a self-referential tone, featuring them in their main 'knight' guises from ''Holy Grail'', mulling over the possibilities of reforming their posse)</span>
				<span class='text'>The book also reveals that a secondary option around this point was the possibility of revitalising the Python brand with a new stage tour, perhaps with the promise of new material</span>
				<span class='text'>This idea had also met with Cleese's refusal, this time with the backing of other members</span>
				<span class='text'>arch 2005 had a full, if nonperforming, reunion of the surviving cast members at the premiere of Idle's musical ''[[Spamalot]]'', based on ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail''</span>
				<span class='text'>It opened in Chicago and has since played in New York on Broadway, London, and numerous other major cities across the world</span>
				<span class='text'>In 2004, it was nominated for 14 [[Tony Awards]] and won three: Best Musical, Best Direction of a Musical for [[Mike Nichols]], and Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Musical for [[Sara Ramirez]], who played the [[Lady of the Lake]], a character specially added for the musical</span>
				<span class='text'>Cleese played the voice of God, played in the film by Chapman</span>
				<span class='text'>wing in part to the success of ''Spamalot'', PBS announced on 13 July 2005 that it would begin to re-air the entire run of ''Monty Python's Flying Circus'' and new one-hour specials focusing on each member of the group, called ''[[Monty Python's Personal Best]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>The book ''A Liar's Autobiography'' was published in 1980 and details Chapman's journey through medical school, alcoholism, acknowledgement of his gay identity, and the tolls of surreal comedy</span>
				<span class='text'>Asked what was true in a deliberately fanciful account by Chapman of his life, Terry Jones joked: &quot;Nothing&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>it's all a downright, absolute, blackguardly lie</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;The film uses Chapman's own voice – from a reading of his autobiography shortly before he died of cancer – and entertainment channel [[Epix (TV channel)|Epix]] announced that the film will be released in early 2012 in both 2D and 3D formats</span>
				<span class='text'>Produced and directed by London-based Bill Jones, Ben Timlett, and Jeff Simpson, the new film has 15 animation companies working on chapters that will range from three to 12 minutes in length, each in a different style</span>

				<span class='text'>Moving from the US to England, he animated features for ''Do Not Adjust Your Set'' and was then asked by its makers to join them on their next project: ''Monty Python's Flying Circus''</span>
				<span class='text'>He co-directed ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' and directed short segments of other Python films (for instance &quot;[[The Crimson Permanent Assurance]]&quot;, the short film that appears before ''The Meaning of Life'')</span>
				<span class='text'>hen Monty Python was first formed, two writing partnerships were already in place: Cleese and Chapman, Jones and Palin</span>
				<span class='text'>That left two in their own corners: Gilliam, operating solo due to the nature of his work, and Eric Idle</span>
				<span class='text'>Regular themes in Idle's contributions were elaborate wordplay and musical numbers</span>
				<span class='text'>After ''Flying Circus'', he hosted ''Saturday Night Live'' four times in the first five seasons</span>
				<span class='text'>Idle's initially successful solo career faltered in the 1990s with the failures of his 1993 film ''[[Splitting Heirs]]'' (written, produced by, and starring him) and 1998's ''[[An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn]]'' (in which he starred), which was awarded five [[Razzies]], including 'Worst Picture of the Year'</span>
				<span class='text'>He revived his career by returning to the source of his worldwide fame, adapting Monty Python material for other media</span>
				<span class='text'>He also wrote the Broadway musical ''Spamalot'', based on the ''Holy Grail'' movie</span>
				<span class='text'>He also wrote ''[[Not the Messiah (He's a Very Naughty Boy)]]'', an [[oratorio]] derived from the ''Life of Brian''</span>
				<span class='text'>erry Jones has been described by other members of the team as the &quot;heart&quot; of the operation</span>
				<span class='text'>Jones had a lead role in maintaining the group's unity and creative independence</span>
				<span class='text'>Python biographer George Perry has commented that should &quot;[you] speak to him on subjects as diverse as [[fossil fuel]]s, or [[Rupert Bear]], or mercenaries in the [[Middle Ages]] or Modern China&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>in a moment you will find yourself hopelessly out of your depth, floored by his knowledge</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Many others agree that Jones is characterised by his irrepressible, good-natured enthusiasm</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Jones' passion often led to prolonged arguments with other group members—in particular Cleese—with Jones often unwilling to back down</span>
				<span class='text'>Since his major contributions were largely behind the scenes (direction, writing), and he often deferred to the other members of the group as an actor, Jones' importance to Python was often underrated</span>
				<span class='text'>However, he does have the legacy of delivering possibly the most famous line in all of Python, as Brian's mother Mandy in ''Life of Brian'', &quot;He's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy!&quot;, a line voted the funniest in film history on two occasions</span>

				<span class='text'>The two also wrote the series ''Ripping Yarns'' together</span>
				<span class='text'>Palin and Jones originally wrote face-to-face, but soon found it was more productive to write apart and then come together to review what the other had written</span>
				<span class='text'>Therefore, Jones and Palin's sketches tended to be more focused than that of the others, taking one bizarre situation, sticking to it, and building on it</span>

				<span class='text'>He appeared in sketches and the Python films, as well as performing some of his songs in ''[[Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>He was also a regular stand-in for absent team members on the rare occasions when they recreated sketches</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, he took the place of Cleese at the [[Concert for George]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Gilliam once noted that if anyone qualified for the title of the seventh Python, it would certainly be Innes</span>
				<span class='text'>He was one of the creative talents in the off-beat [[Bonzo Dog Band]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He would later portray Ron Nasty of [[the Rutles]] and write all of the Rutles' compositions for ''[[All You Need Is Cash]]'' (1978)</span>
				<span class='text'>By 2005, a falling out had occurred between Idle and Innes over additional Rutles projects, the results being Innes' critically acclaimed Rutles &quot;reunion&quot; album ''The Rutles: Archaeology'' and Idle's straight-to-DVD ''The Rutles 2: Can't Buy Me Lunch'', each undertaken without the other's participation</span>
				<span class='text'>According to an interview with Idle in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' in May 2005, his attitude is that Innes and he go back &quot;too far</span>
				<span class='text'>And no further</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Innes has remained silent on the dispute</span>
				<span class='text'>arol Cleveland was the most important female performer in the Monty Python ensemble, commonly referred to as &quot;the female Python&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>She was originally hired by producer/director [[John Howard Davies]] for just the first five episodes of the ''Flying Circus''</span>
				<span class='text'>The Pythons then pushed to make Cleveland a permanent recurring performer after producer/director [[Ian MacNaughton]] brought in several other actresses who were not as good as she was</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Pythons: Autobiography | date=2003 | publisher=Thomas Dunne Books | isbn=0312311443 | page=152 | quote=Of course, Ian [MacNaughton] didn't want to use Carol, he wanted to bring in various bits of totty, so we had a string of people who weren't as good as Carol</span>
				<span class='text'>Eventually we started pushing for Carol and said, 'We must have Carol for this</span>
				<span class='text'>}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cleveland went on to appear in about two-thirds of the episodes, as well as in all of the Python films, and in most of their stage shows, as well</span>
				<span class='text'>Her common portrayal as the stereotypical &quot;blonde bimbo&quot; eventually earned her the sobriquet &quot;Carol Cleavage&quot; from the other Pythons, but she felt that the variety of her roles should not be described in such a pejorative way</span>
				<span class='text'>==Other contributors===Cleese's first wife, [[Connie Booth]], appeared as various characters in all four series of ''Flying Circus''</span>
				<span class='text'>Her most significant role was the &quot;best girl&quot; of the eponymous Lumberjack in &quot;The Lumberjack Song&quot;, though this role was sometimes played by Carol Cleveland</span>
				<span class='text'>Booth appeared in a total of six sketches and also played one-off characters in Python feature films ''And Now for Something Completely Different'' and ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail''</span>
				<span class='text'>ouglas Adams was &quot;discovered&quot; by Chapman when a version of ''Footlights Revue'' (a 1974 BBC2 television show featuring some of Adams' early work) was performed live in London's [[West End of London|West End]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In Cleese's absence from the final TV series, the two formed a brief writing partnership, with Adams earning a writing credit in one episode for a sketch called &quot;[[Patient Abuse]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>In the sketch, a man who had been stabbed by a nurse arrives at his doctor's office bleeding profusely from the stomach, when the doctor makes him fill out numerous senseless forms before he can administer treatment</span>
				<span class='text'>He also had two cameo appearances in this season</span>
				<span class='text'>Firstly, in the episode &quot;The Light Entertainment War&quot;, Adams shows up in a surgeon's mask (as Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Emile Koning, according to the on-screen captions), pulling on gloves, while Palin narrates a sketch that introduces one person after another, and never actually gets started</span>
				<span class='text'>Secondly, at the beginning of &quot;Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Neutron&quot;, Adams is dressed in a &quot;pepperpot&quot; outfit and loads a missile onto a cart being driven by Terry Jones, who is calling out for scrap metal (&quot;Any old iron&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>Adams and Chapman also subsequently attempted a few non-Python projects, including ''[[Out of the Trees]]</span>
				<span class='text'>' He also contributed to a sketch on the soundtrack album for ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail''</span>
				<span class='text'>ther than Carol Cleveland, the only other non-Python to make a significant number of appearances in the ''Flying Circus'' was [[Ian Davidson (scriptwriter)|Ian Davidson]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He appeared in the first two series of the show, and played over 10 roles</span>
				<span class='text'>While Davidson is primarily known as a scriptwriter, it is not known if he had any contribution toward the writing of the sketches, as he is only credited as a performer</span>
				<span class='text'>In total, Davidson is credited as appearing in eight episodes of the show, which is more than any other male actor who was not a Python</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite this, Davidson did not appear in any Python-related media subsequent to series 2, though footage of him was shown on the documentary ''Python Night – 30 Years of Monty Python''</span>
				<span class='text'>tand-up comedian Eddie Izzard, a devoted fan of the group, has occasionally stood in for absent members</span>
				<span class='text'>When the BBC held a &quot;Python Night&quot; in 1999 to celebrate 30 years of the first broadcast of ''Flying Circus'', the Pythons recorded some new material with Izzard standing in for Idle, who had declined to partake in person (he taped a solo contribution from the US)</span>
				<span class='text'>Izzard hosted a history of the group entitled ''The Life of Python'' (1999) that was part of the Python Night and appeared with them at a festival/tribute in [[Aspen, Colorado]], in 1998 (released on DVD as ''Live at Aspen'')</span>
				<span class='text'>Izzard has said that Monty Python was a significant influence on his style of comedy</span>

				<span class='text'>They made appearances in songs such as the &quot;Lumberjack Song&quot; as a backup choir</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, various other contributors and performers for the Pythons included [[John Howard Davies]], John Hughman, [[Lyn Ashley]], Bob Raymond, [[John Young (actor)|John Young]], Rita Davies, Stanley Mason, [[Flanagan (model)|Maureen Flanagan]], and David Ballantyne</span>
