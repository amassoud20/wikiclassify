				<span class='text'>His [[Public speaking|orations]] constitute a significant expression of contemporary Athenian intellectual prowess and provide an insight into the [[politics]] and culture of [[ancient Greece]] during the 4th century&amp;nbsp;BC</span>
				<span class='text'>Demosthenes learned [[rhetoric]] by studying the [[Speech (public address)|speeches]] of previous great orators</span>
				<span class='text'> He delivered his first judicial speeches at the age of 20, in which he argued effectively to gain from his guardians what was left of his inheritance</span>
				<span class='text'>For a time, Demosthenes made his living as a professional speech-writer ([[Logographer (legal)|logographer]]) and a [[Ancient Greek law|lawyer]], writing speeches for use in private [[Lawsuit|legal suits]]</span>
				<span class='text'>emosthenes grew interested in politics during his time as a logographer, and in 354&amp;nbsp;BC he gave his first public political speeches</span>
				<span class='text'>He went on to devote his most productive years to opposing [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]]'s expansion</span>
				<span class='text'>He idealized his city and strove throughout his life to restore Athens's supremacy and motivate his compatriots against [[Philip II of Macedon]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He sought to preserve his city's freedom and to establish an alliance against Macedon, in an unsuccessful attempt to impede Philip's plans to expand his influence southward by conquering all the Greek states</span>
				<span class='text'>After Philip's death, Demosthenes played a leading part in his city's uprising against the new King of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]], [[Alexander the Great]]</span>
				<span class='text'>However, his efforts failed and the revolt was met with a harsh Macedonian reaction</span>
				<span class='text'>To prevent a similar revolt against his own rule, Alexander's successor in this region, [[Antipater]], sent his men to track Demosthenes down</span>
				<span class='text'>Demosthenes took his own life, in order to avoid being arrested by [[Archias of Thurii|Archias]], Antipater's confidant</span>
				<span class='text'>he ''Alexandrian Canon'' compiled by [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]] and [[Aristarchus of Samothrace]] recognized Demosthenes as one of the ten greatest [[Attic orators]] and logographers</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Longinus (literature)|Longinus]] likened Demosthenes to a blazing thunderbolt, and argued that he &quot;perfected to the utmost the tone of lofty speech, living passions, copiousness, readiness, speed&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Logographers were a unique aspect of the Athenian justice system: evidence for a case was compiled by a magistrate in a preliminary hearing and litigants could present it as they pleased within set speeches; however, witnesses and documents were popularly mistrusted (since they could be secured by force or bribery), there was little cross-examination during the trial, there were no instructions to the jury from a judge, no conferencing between jurists before voting, the juries were huge (typically between 201 and 501 members), cases depended largely on questions of probable motive, and notions of natural justice were felt to take precedence over written law—conditions that favoured artfully constructed speeches</span>

				<span class='text'>Thus for example Aeschines accused Demosthenes of unethically disclosing his clients' arguments to their opponents; in particular, that he wrote a speech for Phormion (350 BC), a wealthy banker, and then communicated it to Apollodorus, who was bringing a [[capital punishment|capital charge]] against Phormion</span>

				<span class='text'>De Romilly, ''A Short History of Greek Literature,'' 120–122&lt;/ref&gt;The fact that Demosthenes fought at the battle of Chaeronea as a hoplite indicates that he lacked any military skills</span>

				<span class='text'>Kennedy, &quot;Oratory&quot;, 514-15&lt;/ref&gt;According to [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], a Greek historian and teacher of rhetoric, Demosthenes represented the final stage in the development of Attic prose</span>

				<span class='text'>He had no wit, no humour, no vivacity, in our acceptance of these terms</span>

				<span class='text'>The steward of his money fled to Rhodes, and was arrested by a Macedonian officer, [[Philoxenus (general)|Philoxenus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Philoxenus proceeded to examine the slave, &quot;until he learned everything about such as had allowed themselves to accept a bribe from Harpalus</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He then sent a dispatch to Athens, in which he gave a list of the persons who had taken a bribe from Harpalus</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Demosthenes, however, he never mentioned at all, although Alexander held him in bitter hatred, and he himself had a private quarrel with him</span>
