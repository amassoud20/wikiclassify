				<span class='text'>When the Dauphin Charles granted Joan's urgent request to be equipped for war and placed at the head of his army, his decision must have been based in large part on the knowledge that every orthodox, every rational option had been tried and had failed</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; a course of action that was not without risk</span>
				<span class='text'>Charles' advisers were worried that unless Joan's [[orthodoxy]] could be established beyond doubt&amp;nbsp;– that she was not a heretic or a sorceress&amp;nbsp;– Charles' enemies could easily make the allegation that his crown was a gift from the devil</span>
				<span class='text'>To circumvent this possibility, the Dauphin ordered background inquiries and a theological examination at [[Poitiers]] to verify her morality</span>
				<span class='text'>In April 1429, the commission of inquiry &quot;declared her to be of irreproachable life, a good Christian, possessed of the virtues of humility, honesty and simplicity</span>

				<span class='text'>55&quot;/&gt; The theologians at Poitiers did not render a decision on the issue of divine inspiration; rather, they informed the Dauphin that there was a &quot;favorable presumption&quot; to be made on the divine nature of her mission</span>
				<span class='text'>This was enough for Charles, but they also stated that he had an obligation to put Joan to the test</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;To doubt or abandon her without suspicion of evil would be to repudiate the [[Holy Spirit]] and to become unworthy of God's aid&quot;, they declared</span>

				<span class='text'>[[Jean de Dunois|Jean d'Orléans]], the acting head of the ducal family of Orléans on behalf of his captive half-brother, initially excluded her from [[war council]]s and failed to inform her when the army engaged the enemy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Historians often refer to this man by other names</span>
				<span class='text'>Many call him &quot;Count of Dunois&quot; in reference to a title he received years after Joan's death, since this title is now his best-known designation</span>
				<span class='text'>During Joan's lifetime he was often called &quot;Bastard of Orléans&quot; due to his condition as the illegitimate son of Louis of Orleans</span>
				<span class='text'>His contemporaries viewed this &quot;title&quot; as nothing but a standard method of delineating such illegitimate offspring, but it nonetheless often confuses modern readers because &quot;bastard&quot; has become a popular insult</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Jean d'Orléans&quot; is less precise but not anachronistic</span>

				<span class='text'>he extent of her actual military participation and leadership is a subject of debate among historians</span>
				<span class='text'>On the one hand, Joan stated that she carried her banner in battle and had never killed anyone,&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, W</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and the army was always directly commanded by a nobleman, such as the Duke of Alençon for example</span>
				<span class='text'>On the other hand, many of these same noblemen stated that Joan had a profound effect on their decisions since they often accepted the advice she gave them, believing her advice was Divinely inspired</span>

				<span class='text'>}Joan of Arc's appearance at Orléans coincided with a sudden change in the pattern of the siege</span>
				<span class='text'>During the five months before her arrival the defenders had attempted only one offensive assault, which had ended in defeat</span>
				<span class='text'>On May 4th, however, the Armagnacs attacked and captured the outlying fortress of  [[Saint-Jean-de-Braye|Saint Loup]] (''bastille de Saint-Loup''), followed on 5 May by a march to a second fortress called [[Saint-Jean-le-Blanc, Loiret|Saint-Jean-le-Blanc]], which was found deserted</span>
				<span class='text'>When English troops came out to oppose the advance, a rapid cavalry charge drove them back into their fortresses, apparently without a fight</span>
				<span class='text'>The Armagnacs then attacked and captured an English fortress built around a monastery called [[Siege of Orléans|Les Augustins]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Armagnac troops maintained positions on the south bank of the river before attacking the main English stronghold called ''&quot;les Tourelles&quot;'' on the morning of 7 May</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;DeVries, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>74–83&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporaries acknowledged Joan as the heroine of the engagement</span>
				<span class='text'>She was wounded by an arrow between the neck and shoulder while holding her banner in the trench outside Les Tourelles, but later returned to encourage a final assault which succeeded in taking the fortress</span>
				<span class='text'>The English retreated from Orléans the next day, and the siege was over</span>
				<span class='text'>t Chinon and Poitiers, Joan had declared that she would provide a sign at Orléans</span>
				<span class='text'>The lifting of the siege was interpreted by many people to be that sign, and it gained her the support of prominent clergy such as the [[Archbishop of Embrun]] and the theologian [[Jean Gerson]], both of whom wrote supportive treatises immediately following this event</span>

				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;87–88; 126-127</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The sudden victory at Orléans also led to many proposals for further offensive action</span>
				<span class='text'>Joan persuaded Charles VII to allow her to accompany the army with Duke [[John II of Alençon]], and she gained royal permission for her plan to recapture nearby bridges along the Loire as a prelude to an advance on Reims and the coronation of Charles VII</span>
				<span class='text'>This was a bold proposal because Reims was roughly twice as far away as Paris and deep within enemy territory</span>

				<span class='text'>Other commanders including Jean d'Orléans had been impressed with her performance at Orléans and became her supporters</span>
