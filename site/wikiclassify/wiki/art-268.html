				<span class='text'>Cook made detailed maps of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] prior to making three voyages to the Pacific Ocean, during which he achieved the first recorded European contact with the eastern coastline of [[Australia]] and the [[Hawaiian Islands]], and the first recorded [[circumnavigation]] of [[New Zealand]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ook joined the British [[merchant navy]] as a teenager and joined the Royal Navy in 1755</span>
				<span class='text'>He saw action in the [[Seven Years' War]], and subsequently surveyed and mapped much of the entrance to the [[Saint Lawrence River]] during the [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|siege of Quebec]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This helped bring Cook to the attention of the [[Admiralty]] and [[Royal Society]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This notice came at a crucial moment in both Cook's career and the direction of British overseas exploration, and led to his commission in 1766 as commander of {{ship|HM Bark|Endeavour}} for the first of three Pacific voyages</span>
				<span class='text'>n three voyages Cook sailed thousands of miles across largely uncharted areas of the globe</span>
				<span class='text'>He mapped lands from New Zealand to Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean in greater detail and on a scale not previously achieved</span>
				<span class='text'>As he progressed on his voyages of discovery he surveyed and named features, and recorded islands and coastlines on European maps for the first time</span>
				<span class='text'>He displayed a combination of seamanship, superior surveying and cartographic skills, physical courage and an ability to lead men in adverse conditions</span>
				<span class='text'>ook was killed in Hawaii in a fight with [[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiians]] during his third exploratory voyage in the Pacific in 1779</span>
				<span class='text'>He left a legacy of scientific and geographical knowledge which was to influence his successors well into the 20th&amp;nbsp;century and numerous memorials worldwide have been dedicated to him</span>
				<span class='text'>=Early life and family==James Cook was born on 27 October 1728 in the village of [[Marton, Middlesbrough|Marton]] in [[Yorkshire]] and baptised on 3 November in the local church of St</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1741, after five years schooling, he began work for his father, who had by now been promoted to farm manager</span>
				<span class='text'>For leisure, he would climb a nearby hill, [[Roseberry Topping]], enjoying the opportunity for solitude</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collingridge|2003|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cooks' Cottage]], his parents' last home, which he is likely to have visited, is now in Melbourne, having been moved from England and reassembled, brick by brick, in 1934</span>

				<span class='text'>Cook was taken on as a merchant navy apprentice in their small fleet of vessels, plying coal along the English coast</span>
				<span class='text'>His first assignment was aboard the [[collier (ship type)|collier]] ''Freelove'', and he spent several years on this and various other [[coastal trading vessel|coasters]], sailing between the [[River Tyne|Tyne]] and London</span>
				<span class='text'>As part of his apprenticeship, Cook applied himself to the study of [[algebra]], [[geometry]], [[trigonometry]], [[navigation]] and [[astronomy]]—all skills he would need one day to command his own ship</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;collingridge&quot;/&gt;His three-year apprenticeship completed, Cook began working on trading ships in the [[Baltic Sea]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After passing his examinations in 1752, he soon progressed through the merchant navy ranks, starting with his promotion in that year to [[Master's mate|mate]] aboard the collier [[brig]] ''Friendship''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hough|1994|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1755, within a month of being offered command of this vessel, he volunteered for service in the [[Royal Navy]], when Britain was re-arming for what was to become the [[Seven Years' War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite the need to start back at the bottom of the naval hierarchy, Cook realised his career would advance more quickly in military service and entered the Navy at Wapping on 17 June 1755</span>

				<span class='text'>Cook's two ships remained in Nootka Sound from 29 March to 26 April 1778, in what Cook called Ship Cove, now Resolution Cove,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite bcgnis|18990|Resolution Cove|accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the south end of Bligh Island, about {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} east across Nootka Sound from Yuquot, lay a [[Nuu-chah-nulth people|Nuu-chah-nulth]] village (whose chief Cook did not identify but may have been [[Maquinna]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Relations between Cook's crew and the people of Yuquot were cordial if sometimes strained</span>
				<span class='text'>In trading, the people of Yuquot demanded much more valuable items than the usual trinkets that had worked in Hawaii</span>
				<span class='text'>Metal objects were much desired, but the lead, pewter, and tin traded at first soon fell into disrepute</span>
				<span class='text'>The most valuable items which the British received in trade were [[sea otter]] pelts</span>
				<span class='text'>During the stay, the Yuquot &quot;hosts&quot; essentially controlled the trade with the British vessels; the natives usually visited the British vessels at Resolution Cove instead of the British visiting the village of Yuquot at Friendly Cove</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fisher|1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;After leaving Nootka Sound, Cook explored and mapped the coast all the way to the [[Bering Strait]], on the way identifying what came to be known as [[Cook Inlet]] in Alaska</span>
				<span class='text'>In a single visit, Cook charted the majority of the North American north-west coastline on world maps for the first time, determined the extent of Alaska, and closed the gaps in Russian (from the West) and Spanish (from the South) exploratory probes of the Northern limits of the Pacific</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;seven&quot;/&gt;===Return to Hawaii===Cook returned to Hawaii in 1779</span>
				<span class='text'>After sailing around the archipelago for some eight weeks, he made landfall at [[Kealakekua Bay]], on [[Hawaii (island)|'Hawaii Island']], largest island in the [[Hawaiian Islands|Hawaiian Archipelago]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Cook's arrival coincided with the ''[[Makahiki]]'', a Hawaiian [[harvest festival]] of worship for the Polynesian god [[Lono]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Coincidentally the form of Cook's ship, HMS ''Resolution'', or more particularly the mast formation, sails and rigging, resembled certain significant artefacts that formed part of the season of worship</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;collingridge&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;seven&quot;/&gt; Similarly, Cook's clockwise route around the island of Hawaii before making landfall resembled the processions that took place in a clockwise direction around the island during the Lono festivals</span>
				<span class='text'>It has been argued (most extensively by [[Marshall Sahlins]]) that such coincidences were the reasons for Cook's (and to a limited extent, his crew's) initial [[apotheosis|deification]] by some Hawaiians who treated Cook as an incarnation of Lono</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Sahlins1985&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Sahlins|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though this view was first suggested by members of Cook's expedition, the idea that any Hawaiians understood Cook to be Lono, and the evidence presented in support of it, were challenged in 1992</span>
