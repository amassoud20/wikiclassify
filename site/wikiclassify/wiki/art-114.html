				<span class='text'>376 – 444) was the [[Patriarch of Alexandria]] from 412 to 444</span>
				<span class='text'>He was enthroned when the city was at the height of its influence and power within the [[Roman Empire]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Cyril wrote extensively and was a leading protagonist in the [[Christological controversies]] of the late-4th and 5th centuries</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a central figure in the [[First Council of Ephesus]] in 431, which led to the deposition of [[Nestorius]] as [[Patriarch of Constantinople]]</span>
				<span class='text'>yril is counted among the [[Church Fathers]] and the [[Doctors of the Church]], and his reputation within the Christian world has resulted in his titles ''Pillar of Faith'' and ''Seal of all the Fathers'', but [[Theodosius II]], the [[Roman Emperor]], condemned him for behaving like a &quot;proud pharaoh&quot;, and the [[Nestorianism|Nestorian]] bishops at the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] declared him a heretic, labeling him as a &quot;monster, born and educated for the destruction of the church</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Gibbon]], ''Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', 47</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Cyril is well-known due to his dispute with Nestorius and his supporter Patriarch [[John of Antioch]], whom Cyril excluded from the Council of Ephesus for arriving late</span>
				<span class='text'>He is also known for his expulsion of [[Novatianism|Novatians]] and Jews from Alexandria and for inflaming tensions that led to the murder of the [[hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic philosopher]] [[Hypatia]] by a Christian mob</span>
				<span class='text'>Historians disagree over the extent of his responsibility (mainly due to Christian v Secular views) for these events however they agree that Cyril's canonising as a saint by the Catholic church was a direct consequence of the murder</span>
				<span class='text'>he [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] did not commemorate Saint Cyril in the [[Tridentine Calendar]]: it added his feast only in 1882, assigning to it the date of 9 February</span>
				<span class='text'>The 1969 revision moved it to 27 June, considered to be the day of the saint's death, as celebrated by the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox Church]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Calendarium Romanum'' (Libreria Editrice, 1969), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>95 and 116</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The same date has been chosen for the Lutheran calendar</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and [[Eastern Catholic Church]] celebrate his feast day on 9 June and also, together with [[Pope Athanasius I of Alexandria]], on 18 January</span>
				<span class='text'>=Early life==Little is known for certain of Cyril's early life</span>
				<span class='text'> He was born c</span>
				<span class='text'>376, in the small town of Theodosios, Egypt, near modern-day [[El-Mahalla El-Kubra]]</span>
				<span class='text'>A few years after his birth, his maternal uncle [[Pope Theophilus of Alexandria|Theophilus]] rose to the powerful position of [[Patriarch of Alexandria]]</span>

				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt;  His mother remained close to her brother and under his guidance, Cyril was well educated</span>
				<span class='text'>His writings show his knowledge of Christian writers of his day, including [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]], [[Origen]], [[Didymus the Blind]], and writers of the [[Church of Alexandria]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He received the formal Christian education standard for his day: he studied grammar from age twelve to fourteen (390-392), rhetoric and humanities from fifteen to twenty (393-397) and finally theology and biblical studies (398-402)</span>
				<span class='text'>In 403 he accompanied his uncle to attend a synod in Constantinople</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Patriarch of Alexandria===Theophilus died on 15 October 412, and Cyril was made [[Pope (word)|Pope]] or [[Patriarch of Alexandria]] on 18 October 412, against the party favouring [[Archdeacon]] Timothy</span>
				<span class='text'>===Relationship with the Novatians and Jews====Thus, Cyril followed his uncle in a position that had become powerful and influential, rivalling that of the prefect in a time of turmoil and frequently violent conflict between the cosmopolitan city's [[Paganism|Pagan]], [[Jews|Jewish]], and Christian inhabitants</span>

				<span class='text'>om&lt;/ref&gt;He began to exert his authority by causing the churches of the [[Novatians]] to be closed and their sacred vessels to be seized</span>
				<span class='text'>[Orestes (prefect)|Orestes]], ''[[Praefectus augustalis]]'' of the [[Byzantine Diocese of Egypt|Diocese of Egypt]], steadfastly resisted Cyril's agenda of ecclesiastical encroachment onto secular prerogatives</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wessel, p</span>
				<span class='text'>34</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; On one occasion, Cyril sent the ''grammaticus'' Hierax to secretly discover the content of an edict that Orestes was to promulgate on the mimes shows, which attracted great crowds</span>
				<span class='text'>When the Jews, with whom Cyril had clashed before, {{citation needed|date=September 2013}} discovered the presence of Hierax, they rioted, complaining that Hierax's presence was aimed at provoking them</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;John of Nikiu, 84</span>
				<span class='text'>2</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Then Orestes had Hierax tortured in public in a theatre</span>
				<span class='text'>This order had two aims: the first was to quell the riot, the other to mark Orestes' authority over Cyril</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Socrates Scholasticus, vii</span>
				<span class='text'>3</span>
				<span class='text'>-9</span>
				<span class='text'>Wessel, p</span>
				<span class='text'>34</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;According to Socrates Scholasticus, upon hearing of Hierex's severe and public punishment, Cyril threatened to retaliate against the Jews of Alexandria with &quot;the utmost severities&quot; if the harassment of Christians did not cease immediately</span>
				<span class='text'>In response to Cyril's threat, the Jews of Alexandria grew even more furious, eventually resorting to violence against the Christians</span>
				<span class='text'>They plotted to flush the Christians out at night by running through the streets claiming that the Church of Alexander was on fire</span>
				<span class='text'>When Christians responded to what they were led to believe was the burning down of their church, &quot;the Jews immediately fell upon and slew them&quot; by using rings to recognize one another in the dark and killing everyone else in sight</span>
				<span class='text'>When the morning came, the Jews of Alexandria could not hide their guilt, and Cyril, along with many of his followers, took to the city’s synagogues in search of the perpetrators of the massacre</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Scholasticus&gt;Socrates Scholasticus, ''Ecclesiastical History'', born after 380 AD, died after 439 AD</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;After Cyril rounded up all the Jews in Alexandria, he ordered them to be stripped of all possessions, banished them from Alexandria, and allowed their goods to be pillaged by the remaining citizens of Alexandria</span>
				<span class='text'>With Cyril's banishment of the Jews, &quot;Orestes [</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> was filled with great indignation at these transactions, and was excessively grieved that a city of such magnitude should have been suddenly bereft of so large a portion of its population</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Because of this, the feud between Cyril and Orestes intensified, and both men wrote to the emperor regarding the situation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Scholasticus /&gt; Eventually, Cyril attempted to reach out to Orestes through several peace overtures, including attempted mediation and, when that failed, showed him the Gospels, which would mean that the religious authority of Cyril would require Orestes' acquiescence in the bishop's policy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;name=&quot;wessel35&quot;&gt;Wessel, p</span>
				<span class='text'>35</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Orestes remained unmoved by such gestures</span>
				<span class='text'>his refusal almost cost Orestes his life</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Wadi El Natrun|Nitrian monks]] came from the desert and instigated a riot against Orestes among the population of Alexandria</span>
				<span class='text'>These monks' violence had already been used, 15 years before, by Theophilus (Cyril's uncle) against the &quot;[[Tall Brothers]]&quot;; furthermore, it is said that Cyril had spent five years among them in ascetic training</span>
				<span class='text'>The monks assaulted Orestes and accused him of being a pagan</span>
				<span class='text'>Orestes rejected the accusations, showing that he had been baptised by the Archbishop of Constantinople</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the monks were not satisfied, and one of them, [[Ammonius (monk)|Ammonius]], threw a stone and hit Orestes in the head, and so much blood flowed out that he was covered in it</span>
				<span class='text'>Orestes' guard, fearing to be stoned by the monks, fled leaving Orestes alone</span>
				<span class='text'>The people of Alexandria, however, came to his help, captured Ammonius and put the monks to flight</span>
				<span class='text'>Orestes was cured and put Ammonius under torture in a public place, killing him</span>
				<span class='text'>The prefect then wrote to the emperor [[Theodosius II]], telling him of the events</span>
				<span class='text'>Cyril also wrote to the Emperor, telling his version of the events</span>
				<span class='text'>The bishop also seized the body of Ammonius and put it in a church, conferring upon him the title of ''Thaumasius'' and putting his name in the list of the martyrs</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the Christian population of Alexandria knew that Ammonius had been killed for his assault and not for his faith, and Cyril was obliged to remain silent about the events</span>

				<span class='text'>35-36</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;====Murder of Hypatia====Prefect [[Orestes (prefect)|Orestes]] enjoyed the political backing of [[Hypatia]], an astronomer, philosopher and mathematician who had considerable [[moral authority]] in the city of Alexandria, and who had extensive influence</span>
				<span class='text'>Indeed, many students from wealthy and influential families came to Alexandria purposely to study privately with Hypatia, and many of these later attained high posts in government and the Church</span>
				<span class='text'>Several Christians thought that Hypatia's influence had caused Orestes to reject all reconciliatory offerings by Cyril</span>
				<span class='text'>Modern historians think that Orestes had cultivated his relationship with Hypatia to strengthen a bond with the Pagan community of Alexandria, as he had done with the Jewish one, to handle better the difficult political life of the Egyptian capital</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; A Christian mob, however, possibly led by [[parabalani]], took Hypatia from her chariot and murdered her, hacking her body apart and burning the pieces outside the city walls</span>

				<span class='text'>8-100</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Modern studies represent Hypatia's death as the result of a struggle between two Christian factions, the moderate Orestes, supported by Hypatia, and the more rigid Cyril</span>

				<span class='text'>tml&lt;/ref&gt;====Conflict with Nestorius====Another major conflict was between the [[Alexandrian school|Alexandrian]] and [[Antiochian school|Antiochian]] schools of ecclesiastical reflection, piety, and discourse</span>
				<span class='text'>This long running conflict widened with the [[First Council of Constantinople#Dispute concerning the third canon|third canon of the First Council of Constantinople]] which granted the see of Constantinople primacy over the older sees of Alexandria and Antioch</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, the struggle between the sees of Alexandria and Antioch now included Constantinople</span>
				<span class='text'>The conflict came to a head in 428 after [[Nestorius]], who originated in Antioch, was made Archbishop of Constantinople</span>

				<span class='text'>: The Liturgical Press, 1983, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>136-148</span>
				<span class='text'>ISBN 0-8146-5616-1&lt;/ref&gt;{{POV-section|date=September 2013}}Cyril gained an opportunity to restore Alexandria's pre-eminence over both Antioch and Constantinople when an Antiochine priest who was in Constantinople at Nestorius' behest began to preach against calling [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] the &quot;Mother of God&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>As the term &quot;Mother of God&quot; had long been attached to Mary, the laity in Constantinople complained against the priest</span>
				<span class='text'>Rather than repudiating the priest, Nestorius intervened on his behalf</span>
				<span class='text'>Nestorius argued that Mary was neither a &quot;Mother of Man&quot; nor &quot;[[Theotokos|Mother of God]]&quot; as these referred to [[Christology#Person of Christ|Christ's two natures]]; rather, Mary was the &quot;Mother of Christ&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Christ, according to Nestorius, was the conjunction of the Godhead with his &quot;temple&quot; (which Nestorius was fond of calling his human nature)</span>
				<span class='text'>The controversy seemed to be centered on the issue of the suffering of Christ</span>
				<span class='text'>Cyril maintained that the Son of God or the divine Word, truly suffered &quot;in the flesh</span>

				<span class='text'>Keating, ''The theology of St</span>
				<span class='text'>Cyril of Alexandria: a critical appreciation''; New York: T&amp;T Clark Ltd, 2003, p</span>
				<span class='text'>49</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; However, Nestorius claimed that the Son of God was altogether incapable of suffering, even within his union with the flesh</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Nestorius, Second Epistle to Cyril http://www</span>
				<span class='text'>onachos</span>
				<span class='text'>et/content/patristics/patristictexts/34-patrtexts/189-nestorius-to-cyril2&lt;/ref&gt; Eusebius of Dorylaeum went so far as to accuse Nestorius of [[adoptionism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>By this time, news of the controversy in the capital had reached Alexandria</span>
				<span class='text'>At Easter 429 A</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> Cyril wrote a letter to the Egyptian monks warning them of Nestorius' views</span>
				<span class='text'>A copy of this letter reached Constantinople where Nestorius preached a sermon against it</span>
				<span class='text'>This began a series of letters between Cyril and Nestorius which gradually became more strident in tone</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally, Emperor [[Theodosius II]] convoked the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] (in 431) to solve the dispute</span>
				<span class='text'>Cyril selected Ephesus{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} as the venue since it supported the veneration of Mary</span>
				<span class='text'>The council was convoked before Nestorius's supporters from Antioch and Syria had arrived and thus Nestorius refused to attend when summoned</span>
				<span class='text'>Predictably, the Council ordered the deposition and exile of Nestorius for heresy</span>
				<span class='text'>owever, when [[John of Antioch]] and the other pro-Nestorius bishops finally reached Ephesus, they assembled their own Council, condemned Cyril for heresy, deposed him from his see, and labelled him as a &quot;monster, born and educated for the destruction of the church&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Edward Gibbon, ''Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', 47</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Theodosius, by now old enough to hold power by himself, annulled the verdict of the Council and arrested Cyril, but Cyril eventually escaped</span>
				<span class='text'>Having fled to Egypt, Cyril bribed Theodosius' courtiers, and sent a mob led by [[Dalmatius of Constantinople|Dalmatius]], a [[hermit]], to besiege Theodosius' palace, and shout abuse; the Emperor eventually gave in, sending Nestorius into minor exile (Upper Egypt)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt; Cyril died about 444, but the controversies were to continue for decades, from the [[Second Council of Ephesus|&quot;Robber Synod&quot; of Ephesus]] (449) to the [[Fourth Ecumenical Council|Council of Chalcedon]] (451) and beyond</span>
				<span class='text'>=Theology==Cyril regarded the embodiment of [[God]] in the person of [[Jesus Christ]] to be so mystically powerful that it spread out from the body of the [[God-man (Christianity)|God-man]] into the rest of the race, to reconstitute human nature into a graced and deified condition of the saints, one that promised immortality and [[Transfiguration of Jesus|transfiguration]] to believers</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Nestorius]], on the other hand, saw the incarnation as primarily a moral and ethical example to the faithful, to follow in the footsteps of Jesus</span>
				<span class='text'>Cyril's constant stress was on the simple idea that it was God who walked the streets of Nazareth (hence Mary was ''[[Theotokos]]'', meaning &quot;Giver of Birth to God&quot;), and God who had appeared in a transfigured humanity</span>
				<span class='text'>Nestorius spoke of the distinct &quot;Jesus the man&quot; and &quot;the divine [[Logos]]&quot; in ways that Cyril thought were too [[dichotomous]], widening the ontological gap between man and God in a way that some of his contemporaries believed would annihilate the person of Christ</span>
				<span class='text'>he main issue that prompted this dispute between Cyril and Nestorius was the question which arose at the Council of Constantinople: What exactly was the being to which Mary gave birth? Cyril affirmed that the Holy Trinity consists of a singular divine nature, essence, and being (''ousia'') in three distinct aspects, instantiations, or subsistencies of being (''hypostases'')</span>
				<span class='text'>These distinct hypostases are the Father or God in Himself, the Son or Word (''Logos''), and the Holy Spirit</span>
				<span class='text'>Then, when the Son became flesh and entered the world, the pre-Incarnate divine nature and assumed human nature both remained, but became ''united'' in the person of Jesus</span>
				<span class='text'>This resulted in the [[miaphysitism|miaphysite]] slogan &quot;One Nature united out of two&quot; being used to encapsulate the theological position of this Alexandrian bishop</span>
				<span class='text'>  According to Cyril's theology, there were two states for the Son of God: the state that existed ''prior'' to the Son (or Word/Logos) becoming enfleshed in the person of Jesus and the state that actually became enfleshed</span>
				<span class='text'>The Logos Incarnate suffered and died on the Cross, and therefore the Son was able to suffer without suffering</span>
				<span class='text'>Cyril passionately argued for the continuity of a single subject, God the Word, from the pre-Incarnate state to the Incarnate state</span>
				<span class='text'>The divine Logos was really present in the flesh and in the world—not merely bestowed upon, semantically affixed to, or morally associated with the man Jesus, as the [[adoptionism|adoptionists]] and, he believed, Nestorius had taught</span>
