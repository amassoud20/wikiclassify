				<span class='text'>e was born in the canton [[Graubünden]]'s southerly alpine valley [[Val Bregaglia]], as the eldest of four children to [[Giovanni Giacometti]], a well-known [[Post-Impressionism|post-Impressionist]] painter</span>
				<span class='text'>Coming from an artistic background, he was interested in art from an early age</span>
				<span class='text'>= Early life ==Giacometti was born in [[Borgonovo]], now part of the Swiss municipality of [[Bregaglia]], near the Italian border</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a descendant of Protestant refugees escaping the [[Italian Inquisition|inquisition]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Alberto attended the [[Geneva]] School of [[Fine art|Fine Arts]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His brothers [[Diego Giacometti|Diego]] (1902–85) and [[Bruno Giacometti|Bruno]] (1907–2012) would go on to become artists as well</span>
				<span class='text'>Additionally, [[Zaccaria Giacometti]], later professor of constitutional law and chancellor of the [[University of Zurich]] grew up together with them, having been orphaned at the age of 12 in 1905</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In 1922 he moved to Paris to study under the sculptor [[Antoine Bourdelle]], an associate of [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It was there that Giacometti experimented with [[cubism]] and [[surrealism]] and came to be regarded as one of the leading surrealist sculptors</span>
				<span class='text'>Among his associates were [[Joan Miró|Miró]], [[Max Ernst]], [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], [[Bror Hjorth]] and [[Balthus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>etween 1936 and 1940, Giacometti concentrated his sculpting on the human head, focusing on the sitter's gaze</span>
				<span class='text'>He preferred models he was close to, his sister and the artist [[Isabel Rawsthorne]] (then known as Isabel Delmer)</span>
				<span class='text'>This was followed by a phase in which his statues of Isabel became stretched out; her limbs elongated</span>

				<span class='text'>tml?pagewanted=all]&lt;/ref&gt; Obsessed with creating his sculptures exactly as he envisioned through his unique view of reality, he often carved until they were as thin as nails and reduced to the size of a pack of cigarettes, much to his consternation</span>
				<span class='text'>A friend of his once said that if Giacometti decided to sculpt you, &quot;he would make your head look like the blade of a knife&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>After his marriage to Annette Arm in 1946 his tiny sculptures became larger, but the larger they grew, the thinner they became</span>
				<span class='text'>Giacometti said that the final result represented the sensation he felt when he looked at a woman</span>
				<span class='text'>is paintings underwent a parallel procedure</span>
				<span class='text'>The figures appear isolated and severely attenuated, as the result of continuous reworking</span>
				<span class='text'>Subjects were frequently revisited: one of his favorite models was his younger brother [[Diego Giacometti]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Nor had he ever laid eyes on an actual [[skyscraper]]&quot;, according to his biographer James Lord</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;James Lord, Giacometti: A Biography, [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]], New York, 1986, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>331–332 ISBN ISBN 978-0-374-52525-5 ISBN 0374525250&lt;/ref&gt; Giacometti's work on the project resulted in the four figures of standing women—his largest sculptures—entitled ''Grande femme debout'' I through IV (1960)</span>
				<span class='text'>The commission was never completed, however, because Giacometti was unsatisfied by the relationship between the sculpture and the site, and abandoned the project</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1962, Giacometti was awarded the grand prize for sculpture at the [[Venice Biennale]], and the award brought with it worldwide fame</span>
				<span class='text'>Even when he had achieved popularity and his work was in demand, he still reworked models, often destroying them or setting them aside to be returned to years later</span>
				<span class='text'>The prints produced by Giacometti are often overlooked but the catalogue raisonné, ''Giacometti – The Complete Graphics and 15 Drawings by Herbert Lust'' (Tudor 1970), comments on their impact and gives details of the number of copies of each print</span>
				<span class='text'>Some of his most important images were in editions of only 30 and many were described as rare in 1970</span>
				<span class='text'>n his later years Giacometti's works were shown in a number of large exhibitions throughout Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>Riding a wave of international popularity, and despite his declining health, he travelled to the United States in 1965 for an exhibition of his works at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York</span>
				<span class='text'>As his last work he prepared the text for the book ''Paris sans fin'', a sequence of 150 [[lithographs]] containing memories of all the places where he had lived</span>
				<span class='text'>= Death ==Giacometti died in 1966 of heart disease ([[pericarditis]]) and [[chronic bronchitis]] at the Kantonsspital in [[Chur]], Switzerland</span>
				<span class='text'>His body was returned to his birthplace in Borgonovo, where he was interred close to his parents</span>
				<span class='text'>In May 2007 the executor of his widow's estate, former French foreign minister [[Roland Dumas]], was convicted of illegally selling Giacometti's works to a top auctioneer, Jacques Tajan, who was also convicted</span>
				<span class='text'>Both were ordered to pay €850,000 to the Alberto and Annette Giacometti Foundation</span>

				<span class='text'>Reduced, as they are, to their very core, these figures evoke lone trees in winter that have lost their foliage</span>
				<span class='text'>Within this style, Giacometti would rarely deviate from the three themes that preoccupied him—the walking man; the standing, nude woman; and the bust—or all three, combined in various groupings''</span>
				<span class='text'>'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Metropolitan Museum of Art&quot;/&gt;In a letter to [[Pierre Matisse]], Giacometti wrote: &quot;Figures were never a compact mass but like a transparent construction&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>df?2010 |pages=14–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   In the letter, Giacometti writes about how he looked back at the realist, classical busts of his youth with nostalgia, and tells the story of the existential crisis which precipitated the style he became known for</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;[I rediscovered] the wish to make compositions with figures</span>
				<span class='text'>For this I had to make (quickly I thought; in passing), one or two studies from nature, just enough to understand the construction of a head, of a whole figure, and in 1935 I took a model</span>
				<span class='text'>This study should take, I thought, two weeks and then I could realize my compositions</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> worked with the model all day from 1935 to 1940</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>othing was as I imagined</span>
				<span class='text'> A head, became for me an object completely unknown and without dimensions</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=MOMA /&gt;Since Giacometti achieved exquisite realism with facility when he was executing busts in his early adolescence, Giacometti's difficulty in re-approaching the figure as an adult is generally understood as a sign of existential struggle for meaning, rather than as a technical deficit</span>
				<span class='text'>iacometti was a key player in the [[Surrealist]] art movement, but his work resists easy categorization</span>
				<span class='text'>Some describe it as formalist, others argue it is expressionist or otherwise having to do with what [[Deleuze]] calls &quot;blocs of sensation&quot; (as in Deleuze's analysis of [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Even after his excommunication from the Surrealist group, while the intention of his sculpting was usually imitation, the end products were an expression of his emotional response to the subject</span>
				<span class='text'>He attempted to create renditions of his models the way he saw them, and the way he thought they ought to be seen</span>
				<span class='text'>He once said that he was sculpting not the human figure but &quot;the shadow that is cast&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>cholar [[William Barrett (philosopher)|William Barrett]] in ''Irrational Man: A Study in Existential Philosophy'' (1962), argues that the attenuated forms of Giacometti's figures reflect the view of 20th century [[modernism]] and [[existentialism]] that modern life is increasingly empty and devoid of meaning</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;All the sculptures of today, like those of the past, will end one day in pieces</span>

				<span class='text'>o it is important to fashion ones work carefully in its smallest recess and charge every particle of matter with life</span>
