				<span class='text'>etween 1936 and 1940 Giacometti concentrated his sculpting on the human head focusing on the sitters gaze</span>

				<span class='text'>tmlpagewanted all  Obsessed with creating his sculptures exactly as he envisioned through his unique view of reality he often carved until they were as thin as nails and reduced to the size of a pack of cigarettes much to his consternation</span>
				<span class='text'>A friend of his once said that if Giacometti decided to sculpt you he would make your head look like the blade of a knife</span>
				<span class='text'>After his marriage to Annette Arm in 1946 his tiny sculptures became larger but the larger they grew the thinner they became</span>
				<span class='text'>Giacometti said that the final result represented the sensation he felt when he looked at a woman</span>

				<span class='text'>331–332 ISBN ISBN 978 0 374 52525 5 ISBN 0374525250  Giacomettis work on the project resulted in the four figures of standing women—his largest sculptures—entitled Grande femme debout I through IV 1960</span>
				<span class='text'>The commission was never completed however because Giacometti was unsatisfied by the relationship between the sculpture and the site and abandoned the project</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1962 Giacometti was awarded the grand prize for sculpture at the  and the award brought with it worldwide fame</span>
				<span class='text'>Even when he had achieved popularity and his work was in demand he still reworked models often destroying them or setting them aside to be returned to years later</span>
				<span class='text'>The prints produced by Giacometti are often overlooked but the catalogue raisonné Giacometti – The Complete Graphics and 15 Drawings by Herbert Lust Tudor 1970 comments on their impact and gives details of the number of copies of each print</span>
				<span class='text'>Some of his most important images were in editions of only 30 and many were described as rare in 1970</span>
				<span class='text'>n his later years Giacomettis works were shown in a number of large exhibitions throughout Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>Riding a wave of international popularity and despite his declining health he travelled to the United States in 1965 for an exhibition of his works at the  in New York</span>
				<span class='text'>As his last work he prepared the text for the book Paris sans fin a sequence of 150  containing memories of all the places where he had lived</span>
				<span class='text'>Death Giacometti died in 1966 of heart disease  and  at the Kantonsspital in  Switzerland</span>
				<span class='text'>His body was returned to his birthplace in Borgonovo where he was interred close to his parents</span>
				<span class='text'>In May 2007 the executor of his widows estate former French foreign minister  was convicted of illegally selling Giacomettis works to a top auctioneer Jacques Tajan who was also convicted</span>
				<span class='text'>Both were ordered to pay €850000 to the Alberto and Annette Giacometti Foundation</span>
				<span class='text'> Artistic analysis Regarding Giacomettis sculptural technique and according to the  The rough eroded heavily worked surfaces of Three Men Walking II 1949 typify his technique</span>
				<span class='text'>Reduced as they are to their very core these figures evoke lone trees in winter that have lost their foliage</span>
				<span class='text'>Within this style Giacometti would rarely deviate from the three themes that preoccupied him—the walking man the standing nude woman and the bust—or all three combined in various groupings</span>
				<span class='text'>name Metropolitan Museum of Art In a letter to  Giacometti wrote Figures were never a compact mass but like a transparent construction</span>
				<span class='text'>name MOMA    In the letter Giacometti writes about how he looked back at the realist classical busts of his youth with nostalgia and tells the story of the existential crisis which precipitated the style he became known for</span>
				<span class='text'> rediscovered the wish to make compositions with figures</span>
				<span class='text'>For this I had to make quickly I thought in passing one or two studies from nature just enough to understand the construction of a head of a whole figure and in 1935 I took a model</span>
				<span class='text'>This study should take I thought two weeks and then I could realize my compositions</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> worked with the model all day from 1935 to 1940</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>othing was as I imagined</span>
				<span class='text'> A head became for me an object completely unknown and without dimensions</span>
				<span class='text'>name MOMA  Since Giacometti achieved exquisite realism with facility when he was executing busts in his early adolescence Giacomettis difficulty in re approaching the figure as an adult is generally understood as a sign of existential struggle for meaning rather than as a technical deficit</span>
				<span class='text'>iacometti was a key player in the  art movement but his work resists easy categorization</span>
				<span class='text'>Some describe it as formalist others argue it is expressionist or otherwise having to do with what  calls blocs of sensation as in Deleuzes analysis of </span>
				<span class='text'>Even after his excommunication from the Surrealist group while the intention of his sculpting was usually imitation the end products were an expression of his emotional response to the subject</span>
				<span class='text'>He attempted to create renditions of his models the way he saw them and the way he thought they ought to be seen</span>
				<span class='text'>He once said that he was sculpting not the human figure but the shadow that is cast</span>
				<span class='text'>cholar  in Irrational Man A Study in Existential Philosophy 1962 argues that the attenuated forms of Giacomettis figures lect the view of 20th century  and  that modern life is increasingly empty and devoid of meaning</span>
