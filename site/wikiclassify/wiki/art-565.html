				<span class='text'>du/entries/ockham/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy on William Ockham]&lt;/ref&gt; His importance is as a theologian with a strongly developed interest in logical method, and whose approach was critical rather than system building</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;English Literature Pp 735&quot;/&gt;==Philosophical thought==[[File:Guillelmus - Quaestiones in quattuor libros sententiarum - 4417303 Carta 25r</span>
				<span class='text'>if|thumb|''Quaestiones in quattuor libros sententiarum'']]In [[scholasticism]], Ockham advocated for a reform both in method and in content, the aim of which was simplification</span>
				<span class='text'>Ockham incorporated much of the work of some previous theologians, especially [[John Duns Scotus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>From Scotus, Ockham derived his view of divine omnipotence, his view of grace and justification, much of his epistemology{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} and ethical convictions</span>
				<span class='text'>However, he also reacted to and against Scotus in the areas of predestination, penance, his understanding of universals, his formal distinction ''ex parte rei'' (that is, &quot;as applied to created things&quot;), and his view of parsimony which became known as [[Occam's Razor]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==Nominalism===Ockham was a pioneer of [[nominalism]], and some consider him the father of modern [[epistemology]], because of his strongly argued position that only individuals exist, rather than supra-individual [[universal (metaphysics)|universals]], essences, or forms, and that universals are the products of abstraction from individuals by the human mind and have no extra-mental existence</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Baird | first = Forrest E</span>
				<span class='text'>| authorlink = |author2=Walter Kaufmann  | title = From Plato to Derrida | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall | year = 2008 | location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-13-158591-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He denied the real existence of metaphysical universals and advocated the reduction of [[ontology]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Ockham is sometimes considered an advocate of [[conceptualism]] rather than nominalism, for whereas nominalists held that universals were merely names, i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>words rather than existing realities, conceptualists held that they were mental [[concept]]s, i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>the names were names of concepts, which do exist, although only in the mind</span>
				<span class='text'>Therefore, the universal concept has for its object, not a reality existing in the world outside us, but an internal representation which is a product of the understanding itself and which &quot;supposes&quot; in the mind the things to which the mind attributes it; that is, it holds, for the time being, the place of the things which it represents</span>
				<span class='text'>It is the term of the reflective act of the mind</span>
				<span class='text'>Hence the universal is not a mere word, as [[Roscellinus|Roscelin]] taught, nor a ''sermo'', as [[Peter Abelard|Abelard]] held, namely the word as used in the sentence, but the mental substitute for real things, and the term of the reflective process</span>
				<span class='text'>For this reason Ockham has sometimes also been called a &quot;terminist&quot;, to distinguish him from a nominalist or a conceptualist</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy | wstitle    = William of Ockham | author     =William Turner}}&lt;/ref&gt;Ockham was a theological [[Voluntarism (theology)|voluntarist]] who believed that if God had wanted to, he could have become incarnate as a donkey or an ox, or even as both a donkey and a man at the same time</span>
				<span class='text'>He was criticized for this belief by his fellow theologians and philosophers</span>

				<span class='text'>Grenz}}&lt;/ref&gt;===Efficient reasoning===One important contribution that he made to modern science and modern intellectual culture was efficient reasoning with the principle of parsimony in explanation and theory building that came to be known as [[Occam's Razor]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This maxim, as interpreted by [[Bertrand Russell]],&lt;ref name=&quot;russell&quot;&gt;{{cite book  | last = Russell  | first = Bertrand  | title = History of Western Philosophy  | publisher = [[Allen &amp; Unwin]]  | year = 2000  | pages = 462–463  | isbn = 0-415-22854-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; states that if one can explain a phenomenon without assuming this or that hypothetical entity, there is no ground for assuming it, i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>that one should always opt for an explanation in terms of the fewest possible causes, factors, or variables</span>
				<span class='text'>He turned this into a concern for ontological parsimony; the principle says that one should not multiply entities beyond necessity – ''Entia non sunt multiplicanda sine necessitate'' – although this well-known formulation of the principle is not to be found in any of Ockham's extant writings</span>

				<span class='text'>''The Cambridge Companion to Ockham''</span>
				<span class='text'>Cambridge University Press, 1999: 104</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; For Ockham, the only truly necessary entity is God; everything else is contingent</span>
				<span class='text'>He thus does not accept the [[principle of sufficient reason]], rejects the distinction between essence and existence, and advocates against the [[Thomism|Thomistic doctrine]] of active and passive intellect</span>
				<span class='text'>His scepticism to which his ontological parsimony request leads appears in his doctrine that human reason can prove neither the immortality of the soul nor the existence, unity, and infinity of God</span>
				<span class='text'>These truths, he teaches, are known to us by revelation alone</span>
				<span class='text'>==Natural philosophy===Ockham wrote a great deal on [[natural philosophy]], including a long commentary on [[Physics (Aristotle)|Aristotle's ''Physics'']]</span>
				<span class='text'>According to the principle of ontological parsimony, he holds that we do not need to allow entities in all ten of Aristotle's categories; we thus do not need the category of quantity, as the mathematical entities are not &quot;real&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Mathematics must be applied to other categories, such as the categories of substance or qualities, thus anticipating modern scientific renaissance while violating Aristotelian prohibition of ''metabasis''</span>
				<span class='text'>==Theory of knowledge===In the theory of knowledge, Ockham rejected the scholastic theory of species, as unnecessary and not supported by experience, in favour of a theory of abstraction</span>
				<span class='text'>This was an important development in late medieval [[epistemology]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also distinguished between intuitive and abstract cognition; intuitive cognition depends on the existence or non existence of the object, whereas abstractive cognition &quot;abstracts&quot; the object from the existence predicate</span>
				<span class='text'>Interpreters are, as yet, undecided about the roles of these two types of cognitive activities</span>
				<span class='text'>==Political theory===Ockham is also increasingly being recognized as an important contributor to the development of Western constitutional ideas,{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} especially those of government with limited responsibility</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=January 2014}} He was one of the first medieval authors to advocate a form of church/state separation,{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} and was important for the early development of the notion of property rights</span>
				<span class='text'>His political ideas are regarded as &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;secular&quot;,{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} holding for a secular absolutism</span>

				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=January 2014}}Ockham was for complete separation of spiritual rule and earthly rule</span>
				<span class='text'>He thought that the pope and churchmen have no right or grounds at all for secular rule like having property, citing 2 Tim</span>

				<span class='text'>That belongs solely to earthly rulers, who may also accuse the pope of crimes, if need be</span>

				<span class='text'>Pages 160, 167-168, 202, 204, 207-209</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;After the Fall the God had given men, also non-Christians, two powers: private ownership and the right to set their rulers, who should serve the interest of the people, not some special interests</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus he preceded [[Thomas Hobbes]] in formulating [[social contract]] theory along with earlier scholars</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=vm/&gt;Ockham said that the Franciscans avoided both private and common ownership by using commodities, including food and clothes, without any rights, with mere ''usus facti'', the ownership still belonging to the donor of the item or to the pope</span>
				<span class='text'>Their opponents such as pope [[John XXII]] wrote that use without any ownership cannot be justified: &quot;''It is impossible that an external deed could be just if the person has no right to do it</span>
				<span class='text'>'&quot; &lt;ref name=vm/&gt;Thus the disputes on the heresy of Franciscans lead Ockham and others formulate some fundamentals of economic theory and the theory of ownership</span>
