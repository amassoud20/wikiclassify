				<span class='text'>]Nader Shah's rule abruptly ended in June 1747 when he was assassinated by his own guards</span>
				<span class='text'>The guards involved in the assassination did so secretly so as to prevent the Abdalis from coming to their King's rescue</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Durrani was told that the Shah had been killed by one of his wives</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite the danger of being attacked, the Abdali contingent led by Durrani rushed either to save the Shah or to confirm what happened</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon reaching the Shah's tent, they were only to see his body and severed head</span>
				<span class='text'>Having served him so loyally, the Abdalis wept at having failed their leader,&lt;ref&gt;[[Olaf Caroe]], ''The Pathans'' (1981 reprint)&lt;/ref&gt; and headed back to Kandahar</span>
				<span class='text'>Befroe the retreat to Kandahar, he had &quot;removed&quot; the royal seal from Nader Shah's finger and the [[Koh-i-Noor]] diamond tied &quot;around the arm of his deceased master&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>On their way back to Kandahar, the Abdalis had &quot;unanimously accepted&quot; Durrani as their new leader</span>

				<span class='text'>Along the way and by sheer luck, they managed to capture a caravan with booty from India</span>
				<span class='text'>He and his troops were rich; moreover, they were experienced fighters</span>

				<span class='text'>]Following his predecessor, Durrani set up a special force closest to him consisting mostly of his fellow Durranis and other Pashtuns, as well as [[Tajik people|Tajiks]], [[Qizilbash]] and other Muslims</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;EofI&quot;/&gt; He began his military conquest by capturing [[Ghazni]] from the Ghiljis and then wresting [[Kabul]] from the local ruler, and thus strengthened his hold over Khorasan</span>
				<span class='text'>Leadership of the various Afghan tribes rested mainly on the ability to provide booty for the clan, and Durrani proved remarkably successful in providing both booty and occupation for his followers</span>
				<span class='text'>Apart from invading the [[Punjab region]] three times between the years 1747–1753, he captured Herat in 1750</span>

				<span class='text'>48&lt;/ref&gt;=== Indian invasions ==={{see also|Indian Campaign of Ahmad Shah Durrani}}==== Early invasions ====Abdali invaded [[India]] seven times from 1748 to 1767</span>
				<span class='text'>The frequency of his repeated invasions reflect the &quot;tireless energey, ambition&quot; and purpose of the &quot;invader&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Being a poor as well as a &quot;backward country&quot;, [[Afghanistan]] could not provide subsistence to its population or provide a financial support for running the government</span>
				<span class='text'>So it was &quot;necessary&quot; of Abdali to invade a &quot;rich but poorly defended neighbouring country&quot; India for plundering and exploiting her resources</span>
				<span class='text'>He also wanted to establish &quot;political hegemony&quot; in India</span>
				<span class='text'>During his time, the [[Mughal empire]] was disintergrating and he was &quot;eager to step into the shoes of the decadent Mughal authority&quot; to fill up the &quot;political vacuum without any loss of time&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;AS&quot;/&gt;Durrani aroused the Afghans' &quot;religious passions&quot; to fire and &quot;sword into the land of infidels[ [[India]] ]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He crossed the [[Khyber pass]] in December 1747 with 40,000 men for his first invasion of India</span>
				<span class='text'>He occupied Peshawar without any opposition</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Mehta, p</span>
				<span class='text'>49&lt;/ref&gt; Durrani first crossed the [[Indus River]] in 1748, the year after his ascension&amp;nbsp;– his forces sacked and absorbed [[Lahore]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The following year (1749), the Mughal ruler was induced to cede [[Sindh]] and all of the Punjab including the vital trans Indus River to him, in order to save his capital from being attacked by the forces of the Durrani Empire</span>
				<span class='text'>Having thus gained substantial territories to the east without a fight, Durrani and his forces turned westward to take possession of Herat, which was ruled by Nader Shah's grandson, [[Shahrukh Afshar|Shah Rukh]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The city fell to the Afghans in 1750, after almost a year of siege and bloody conflict; the Afghan forces then pushed on into present-day Iran, capturing Nishapur and Mashhad in 1751</span>
				<span class='text'>Durrani then pardoned Shah Rukh and reconstituted Khorasan, but a tributary of the Durrani Empire</span>
				<span class='text'>This marked the westernmost border of the Afghan Empire as set by the [[Pul-i-Abrisham]], on the Mashhad-Tehran road</span>

				<span class='text'>His refusal to continue his campaigns deeper into India prevented a clash with the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] and allowed them to continue to acquire power and influence after they took complete control of [[Bengal]] in 1793</span>

				<span class='text'>He seems to have been naturally disposed to mildness and clemency and though it is impossible to acquire sovereign power and perhaps, in Asia, to maintain it, without crimes; yet the memory of no eastern prince is stained with fewer acts of cruelty and injustice</span>

				<span class='text'>They not only lost the outlying territories but also alienated some [[Pashtun tribes]] and those of other Durrani lineages</span>
				<span class='text'>Until [[Dost Mohammad Khan]]'s ascendancy in 1826, chaos reigned in Afghanistan, which effectively ceased to exist as a single entity, disintegrating into a fragmented collection of small countries or units</span>
