				<span class='text'> His degree course was interrupted by the [[First World War]] and he never returned to [[college graduate|graduate]]</span>
				<span class='text'>At the beginning of 1915 he volunteered for service in the British Army but was classified as unfit for active duty</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|An early experimental television broadcast]]The development of television was the result of work by many inventors</span>
				<span class='text'> Among them, Baird was a prominent pioneer and made major advances in the field</span>
				<span class='text'>Many historians credit Baird with being the first to produce a live, moving, [[greyscale]] television image from [[reflected light]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Baird achieved this, where other inventors had failed, by obtaining a better photoelectric cell and improving the [[signal conditioning]] from the photocell and the video amplifier</span>
				<span class='text'>etween 1902 and 1907, [[Arthur Korn]] invented and built the first successful signal-conditioning circuits for image transmission</span>
				<span class='text'>The circuits overcame the image-destroying lag effect that is part of selenium photocells</span>
				<span class='text'>Korn's compensation circuit allowed him to send still [[fax]] pictures by telephone or wireless between countries and even over oceans, while his circuit operated without benefit of electronic amplification</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Korn's success at transmitting halftone still images suggested that such compensation circuits might work in television</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Abramson87/&gt; Nipkow's work is important because Baird and many others chose to develop it into a broadcast medium</span>
				<span class='text'>n early 1923, and in poor health, Baird moved to 21 Linton Crescent, [[Hastings]], on the south coast of England and later rented a workshop in the Queen's Arcade in the town</span>
				<span class='text'>Baird built what was to become the world's first working television set using items including an old hatbox and a pair of scissors, some darning needles, a few bicycle light lenses, a used tea chest, and sealing wax and glue that he purchased</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=AMH/&gt; In February 1924, he demonstrated to the ''Radio Times'' that a semi-mechanical [[analogue television]] system was possible by transmitting moving silhouette images</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;From 1929 to 1932, the BBC transmitters were used to broadcast television programmes using the 30-line Baird system, and from 1932 to 1935, the BBC also produced the programmes in their own studio at 16 Portland Place</span>
				<span class='text'>On 3 November 1936, from [[Alexandra Palace]] located on the high ground of the north London ridge, the BBC began alternating Baird 240-line transmissions with EMI's electronic scanning system which had recently been improved to 405 lines after a merger with Marconi</span>
				<span class='text'>The Baird system at the time involved an intermediate film process, where footage was shot on cinefilm which was rapidly developed and scanned</span>
				<span class='text'> The trial was due to last 6 months but the BBC ceased broadcasts with the Baird system in February 1937, due in part to a disastrous fire in the Baird facilities at Crystal Palace</span>
				<span class='text'> It was becoming apparent to the BBC that the Baird system would ultimately fail due in large part to the lack of mobility of the Baird system's cameras, with their developer tanks, hoses, and cables</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kamm and Baird, ''John Logie Baird: A Life'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>286&lt;/ref&gt;Baird's television systems were replaced by the electronic television system developed by the newly formed company EMI-[[Marconi Company|Marconi]] under [[Isaac Shoenberg]], which had access to patents developed by [[Vladimir Zworykin]] and [[RCA]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Similarly, [[Philo T</span>
				<span class='text'>Farnsworth]]'s electronic &quot;Image Dissector&quot; camera was available to Baird's company via a patent-sharing agreement</span>
				<span class='text'> However, the Image Dissector camera was found to be lacking in light sensitivity, requiring excessive levels of illumination</span>
				<span class='text'> Baird used the Farnsworth tubes instead to scan cinefilm, in which capacity they proved serviceable though prone to drop-outs and other problems</span>
				<span class='text'> Farnsworth himself came to London to Baird's [[Crystal Palace School|Crystal Palace]] laboratories in 1936, but was unable to fully solve the problem; the fire that burned Crystal Palace to the ground later that year further hampered the Baird company's ability to compete</span>

				<span class='text'>286–289</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Baird made many contributions to the field of electronic television after mechanical systems had taken a back seat</span>
				<span class='text'> In 1939, he showed colour television using a [[cathode ray tube]] in front of which revolved a disc fitted with colour filters, a method taken up by [[CBS]] and RCA in the United States</span>
				<span class='text'> In 1941, he patented and demonstrated a system of three-dimensional television at a definition of 500 lines</span>
				<span class='text'> On 16 August 1944, he gave the world's first demonstration of a fully electronic [[colour television]] display</span>
				<span class='text'> His 600-line colour system used triple [[interlacing]], using six scans to build each picture</span>

				<span class='text'> The picture from the camera is typically superimposed on the pilot's forward view by displaying it in the [[head up display]]</span>
				<span class='text'> They have also found a use in airborne police helicopters providing, not only night vision, but the ability to detect heat sources (such as people) during the day</span>
				<span class='text'>These systems do not use the disc of lenses that Baird used, but instead use discs of prisms to scan the image onto a cooled infrared detector</span>
				<span class='text'>Electronic pick up tubes are unsuitable for this application because there is no suitable target material with a sensitivity to long wavelength infrared light</span>
				<span class='text'> Further, the glass bulb is opaque to such wavelengths</span>
				<span class='text'>=Other inventions==Some of Baird's early inventions were not fully successful</span>
				<span class='text'>In his twenties he tried to create [[diamonds]] by heating [[graphite]] and shorted out Glasgow's electricity supply</span>
				<span class='text'>Later Baird invented a glass razor which was rust-resistant, but shattered</span>
				<span class='text'>Inspired by pneumatic tyres he attempted to make pneumatic shoes, but his prototype contained semi-inflated balloons which burst</span>
				<span class='text'>He also invented a thermal undersock (the Baird undersock), which was moderately successful</span>
				<span class='text'> Baird suffered from cold feet, and after a number of trials, he found that an extra layer of cotton inside the sock provided warmth</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=AMH&gt;American Media History, Fellow, p</span>
				<span class='text'>278&lt;/ref&gt;Baird's numerous other developments demonstrated his particular talent at invention</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a visionary and began to dabble with electricity</span>
				<span class='text'> In 1928, he developed an early video recording device, which he dubbed [[Phonovision]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The system consisted of a large Nipkow disk attached by a mechanical linkage to a conventional 78-rpm record-cutting lathe</span>
				<span class='text'>The result was a disc that could record and play back a 30-line video signal</span>
				<span class='text'>Technical difficulties with the system prevented its further development, but some of the original phonodiscs have been preserved, and have since been restored by Donald McLean, a Scottish electrical engineer</span>

				<span class='text'>om/&lt;/ref&gt;Baird's other developments were in [[Optical fiber|fibre-optics]], radio direction finding, [[infrared]] [[Night vision|night viewing]] and [[radar]]</span>
				<span class='text'>There is discussion about his exact contribution to the development of radar, for his wartime defence projects have never been officially acknowledged by the [[UK government]]</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Malcolm Baird, his son, what is known is that in 1926 Baird filed a patent for a device that formed images from reflected radio waves, a device remarkably similar to radar, and that he was in correspondence with the British government at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>The radar contribution is in dispute</span>
				<span class='text'>According to some experts, Baird's &quot;noctovision&quot; is not radar</span>
				<span class='text'>Unlike radar (except Doppler radar), Noctovision is incapable of determining the distance to the scanned subject</span>
				<span class='text'>Noctovision also cannot determine the coordinates of the subject in three-dimensional space</span>
