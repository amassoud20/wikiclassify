				<span class='text'>He was the third of five children born to [[Alfred Perceval Graves]] (1846–1931), an [[Anglo-Irish]] school inspector, [[Gaels|Gaelic]] scholar and the author of the popular song &quot;Father O'Flynn&quot;, and his second wife, Amalie von Ranke (1857–1951)</span>
				<span class='text'>Graves's mother was from a recently ennobled German family, the eldest daughter of [[Heinrich von Ranke]], a professor of medicine at the [[University of Munich]], and his wife, Luise Tiarks</span>
				<span class='text'>She was also a greatniece of the German historian [[Leopold von Ranke]]</span>
				<span class='text'>t the age of seven, [[classification of pneumonia|double pneumonia]] following [[measles]] almost took Graves's life, the first of three occasions when he was despaired of by his doctors as a result of afflictions of the lungs, the second being the result of a war-wound (see below) and the third when he contracted [[1918 flu pandemic|Spanish influenza]] in late 1918, immediately before [[Demobilization|demobilisation]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; At school, Graves was enrolled as Robert von Ranke Graves and in Germany his books are published under that name but before and during the First World War, the name caused him difficulties</span>
				<span class='text'>In August 1916 an officer who disliked him spread the rumour that he was a spy; a brother to a captured German spy who had coincidentally taken the name Carl Graves</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Graves (1960) p</span>
				<span class='text'>172</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The problem resurfaced in a minor way in the [[Second World War]], when a suspicious rural policeman blocked his appointment to the [[Special Constabulary]]</span>

				<span class='text'>281</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Graves's eldest half-brother, [[Philip Graves|Philip Perceval Graves]], achieved note as a journalist and his younger brother, [[Charles Patrick Graves]], was a writer and journalist</span>

				<span class='text'>om/view/article/31166, accessed 27 July 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;==Education==Graves received his early education at a series of six [[preparatory school (United Kingdom)|preparatory schools]], including [[King's College School]] in [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]], Penrallt in Wales, [[Hillbrow School]] in [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]], [[Rokeby Preparatory School|Rokeby School]] in [[Kingston upon Thames]] and [[Copthorne Prep School|Copthorne]] in [[Sussex]], from which last in 1909 he won a [[scholarship]] to [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Graves (1960) pp</span>
				<span class='text'>21–25</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; There, in response to persecution because of the German element in his name, his outspokenness, his scholarly and moral seriousness and poverty relative to the other boys, he feigned madness, began to write poetry and took up boxing, in due course becoming school champion at both [[Welterweight|welter-]] and [[middleweight]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Graves (1960) pp</span>
				<span class='text'>38–48</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He also sang in the choir, meeting there an aristocratic boy three years younger, G</span>
				<span class='text'>H</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Peter&quot; Johnstone, with whom he began an intense romantic friendship, the scandal of which led ultimately to an interview with the headmaster</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Graves (1960) pp</span>
				<span class='text'>45–52</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Among the masters his chief influence was [[George Mallory]], who introduced him to contemporary literature and took him mountaineering in vacations</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graves (1960) pp</span>
				<span class='text'>55–60</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In his final year at Charterhouse, he won a [[Classics|classical]] [[Exhibition (scholarship)|exhibition]] to [[St John's College, Oxford]] but did not take his place there until after the war</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Graves (1960) pp</span>
				<span class='text'>36–37</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==First World War==At the outbreak of the [[First World War]] in August 1914, Graves enlisted almost immediately, taking a commission in the [[Royal Welch Fusiliers]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He published his first volume of poems, ''Over the Brazier'', in 1916</span>
				<span class='text'>He developed an early reputation as a war poet and was one of the first to write realistic poems about experience of frontline conflict</span>
				<span class='text'>In later years, he omitted his war poems from his collections, on the grounds that they were too obviously &quot;part of the war poetry boom</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; At the [[Battle of the Somme (1916)|Battle of the Somme]], he was so badly wounded by a shell-fragment through the lung that he was expected to die and was officially reported as having died of wounds</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Seymour (1995) p</span>
				<span class='text'>54</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He gradually recovered and, apart from a brief spell back in France, spent the remainder of the war in England</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Seymour (1995)  pp</span>
				<span class='text'>58–60</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Siegfried Sassoon by George Charles Beresford (1915)</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|[[Siegfried Sassoon]], 1915]]One of Graves's friends at this time was the poet [[Siegfried Sassoon]], a fellow officer in his [[regiment]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1917, Sassoon rebelled against the conduct of the war by making a public antiwar statement</span>
				<span class='text'>Graves feared Sassoon could face a [[court martial]] and intervened with the military authorities, persuading them that Sassoon was suffering from [[shell shock]] and that they should treat him accordingly</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Graves (1960) pp</span>
				<span class='text'>214–16</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Sassoon was sent to [[Craiglockhart Hydropathic|Craiglockhart]], a military hospital near Edinburgh, where he was treated by Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>[[W</span>
				<span class='text'>H</span>
				<span class='text'>R</span>
				<span class='text'>Rivers]] and met fellow patient [[Wilfred Owen]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Graves (1960) pp</span>
				<span class='text'>216–17</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Graves also suffered from shell shock, or [[neurasthenia]] as it was then called, but he was never hospitalised for it:&lt;blockquote&gt;I thought of going back to France, but realised the absurdity of the notion</span>
				<span class='text'>Since 1916, the fear of gas obsessed me: any unusual smell, even a sudden strong smell of flowers in a garden, was enough to send me trembling</span>
				<span class='text'>And I couldn't face the sound of heavy shelling now; the noise of a car back-firing would send me flat on my face, or running for cover</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Graves (1960)  pp</span>
				<span class='text'>219–20</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The friendship between Graves and Sassoon is documented in Graves's letters and biographies; the story is fictionalised in [[Pat Barker]]'s novel ''[[Regeneration (novel)|Regeneration]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The intensity of their early relationship is demonstrated in Graves's collection, ''[[Fairies and Fusiliers]]'' (1917), which contains many poems celebrating their friendship</span>
				<span class='text'>Sassoon remarked upon a &quot;heavy sexual element&quot; within it, an observation supported by the sentimental nature of much of the surviving correspondence between the two men</span>
				<span class='text'>Through Sassoon, Graves became a friend of Wilfred Owen, &quot;who often used to send me poems from France</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Graves (1960) p</span>
				<span class='text'>228</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Graves's army career ended dramatically with an incident which could have led to a charge of [[desertion]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Having been posted to [[Limerick]] in late 1918, he &quot;woke up with a sudden chill, which I recognized as the first symptoms of [[Spanish influenza]]</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; &quot;I decided to make a run for it,&quot; he wrote, &quot;I should at least have my influenza in an English, and not an Irish, hospital</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Arriving at [[London Waterloo station|Waterloo]] with a high fever but without the official papers that would secure his release from the army, he chanced to share a taxi with a demobilisation officer also returning from Ireland, who completed his papers for him with the necessary secret codes</span>

				<span class='text'>231–33</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Postwar==[[File:Robert Graves home in Deià</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|The home of Robert Graves in Deià, Majorca]]Immediately after the war, Graves had a wife, [[Nancy Nicholson]], and a growing family but was financially insecure and weakened physically and mentally:&lt;blockquote&gt; Very thin, very nervous and with about four years' loss of sleep to make up, I was waiting until I got well enough to go to Oxford on the Government educational grant</span>
				<span class='text'>I knew that it would be years before I could face anything but a quiet country life</span>
				<span class='text'>My disabilities were many: I could not use a telephone, I felt sick every time I travelled by train, and to see more than two new people in a single day prevented me from sleeping</span>
				<span class='text'>I felt ashamed of myself as a drag on Nancy, but had sworn on the very day of my demobilization never to be under anyone's orders for the rest of my life</span>
				<span class='text'>Somehow I must live by writing</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Graves (1960) p</span>
				<span class='text'>236</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In October 1919, he took up his place at the [[University of Oxford]], soon changing course to [[English literature|English Language and Literature]], though managing to retain his Classics [[Exhibition (scholarship)|exhibition]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In consideration of his health, he was permitted to live a little outside [[Oxford]], on [[Boars Hill]], where the residents included [[Robert Bridges]], [[John Masefield]] (his landlord), [[Edmund Blunden]], [[Gilbert Murray]] and [[Robert Nichols (poet)|Robert Nichols]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Graves (1960) pp</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1926, he took up a post at [[Cairo University]], accompanied by his wife, their children and the poet [[Laura Riding]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He returned to London briefly, where he split up with his wife under highly emotional circumstances (at one point Riding attempted suicide) before leaving to live with Riding in [[Deià]], [[Majorca]]</span>
				<span class='text'>There they continued to publish letterpress books under the rubric of the [[Seizin Press]], founded and edited the literary journal, ''Epilogue'' and wrote two successful academic books together: ''A Survey of Modernist Poetry'' (1927) and ''A Pamphlet Against Anthologies'' (1928); both had great influence on modern literary criticism, particularly [[New Criticism]]</span>

				<span class='text'>The autobiographical ''[[Good-bye to All That]]'' (1929, revised by him and republished in 1957) proved a success but cost him many of his friends, notably [[Siegfried Sassoon]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1934 he published his most commercially successful work, ''[[I, Claudius]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Using classical sources he constructed a complex and compelling tale of the life of the Roman emperor [[Claudius]], a tale extended in the sequel ''[[Claudius the God]]'' (1935)</span>
				<span class='text'>The Claudius books were turned into the very popular television series [[I, Claudius]] shown in both Britain and United States in the 1970s</span>
				<span class='text'>Another historical novel by Graves, ''[[Count Belisarius]]'' (1938), recounts the career of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] general [[Belisarius]]</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1946, he and Beryl (they were not to marry until 1950) re-established a home with their three children, in [[Deià]], Majorca</span>
				<span class='text'>The house is now a museum</span>
				<span class='text'>The year 1946 also saw the publication of his historical novel, ''[[King Jesus]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>He published ''[[The White Goddess]]'' in 1948</span>
				<span class='text'>He turned to [[science fiction]] with ''[[Seven Days in New Crete]]'' (1949) and in 1953 he published ''The Nazarene Gospel Restored'' with Joshua Podro</span>
				<span class='text'>He also wrote ''Hercules, My Shipmate'' in 1945 which was first published as ''The Golden Fleece'' in 1944</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1955, he published ''[[The Greek Myths]]'', which retells a large body of Greek myths, each tale followed by extensive commentary drawn from the system of ''The White Goddess''</span>

				<span class='text'>He survived for ten more years, in an increasingly dependent condition, until he died from heart failure on 7 December 1985 at 90</span>
				<span class='text'>He was buried the next morning in the small churchyard on a hill at [[Deià]], at the site of a shrine that had once been sacred to ''[[The White Goddess]]'' of Pelion</span>
