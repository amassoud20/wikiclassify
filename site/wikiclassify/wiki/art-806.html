				<span class='text'>The sharpshooting Bird made his name stepping up his performance in critical situations, and is credited with a long list of dominating games, [[buzzer beater]]s and [[Clutch (sports)|clutch]] defensive plays</span>
				<span class='text'>He won two NBA Finals MVP and three regular-season MVP awards</span>
				<span class='text'>He won them all in a row, a feat only shared by [[Bill Russell]] and [[Wilt Chamberlain]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Few players have performed as brilliantly in critical moments of games</span>
				<span class='text'> In Game 7 of the 1981 Eastern Conference finals against the rival [[Philadelphia 76ers]], the Sixers led all game</span>
				<span class='text'>Inside the final minute, Boston and Philadelphia were tied 89–89 when Bird sank a fast-break mid-range pull-up bank shot with his left hand, a very difficult shot to execute under intense pressure</span>
				<span class='text'>That basket put the Celtics up 91–89</span>
				<span class='text'>The Sixers had a chance to win the game, but threw away the lob inbounds pass intended for Julius Erving</span>
				<span class='text'>The Celtics' 91–90 win put them into the NBA Finals for the first time since 1976 and they would go on to win the NBA championship in the Finals, beating the Houston Rockets in 6 games</span>
				<span class='text'>In the late stages of the game, Bird also had two key steals, two free throws made, a rebound, and a blocked shot</span>
				<span class='text'> On January 27, 1985, Bird hit an amazing baseline jumper at the buzzer while falling out of bounds to give the Celtics a 128–127 win over Portland</span>
				<span class='text'> In the series-clinching Game 6 of the 1986 Finals, Bird recorded a [[triple-double]] of 29 points, 11 rebounds and 12 assists</span>
				<span class='text'> In Game 5 of the 1987 Eastern Conference Finals against the [[Detroit Pistons]], with five seconds remaining in the fourth quarter and Boston trailing the Pistons 107–106, Bird stole an inbound pass from [[Isiah Thomas]] that was intended for [[Bill Laimbeer]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Falling out of bounds, Bird turned and passed the ball to teammate [[Dennis Johnson]], who was cutting to the basket and converted a 2-point layup with less than a second left</span>
				<span class='text'>The Pistons called a timeout but had no chance of getting off a shot</span>
				<span class='text'>The dramatic play saved the series for the Celtics who won in 7 games, and they advanced to the Finals</span>
				<span class='text'> In a game in [[Washington, D</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Washington]] against the [[Washington Wizards|Bullets]] in 1987, the Celtics trailed the Bullets by 3 points with 6 seconds remaining in regulation</span>
				<span class='text'>A three-pointer by Bird had been waved off because their coach, [[K</span>
				<span class='text'>C</span>
				<span class='text'>Jones]], had already called a timeout</span>
				<span class='text'>Bird then made another three-pointer to send the game into overtime</span>
				<span class='text'>When the Celtics trailed by two points near the end of the first overtime, Bird was fouled and converted both free throws</span>
				<span class='text'>In the second overtime, trailing by 1 point with 2 seconds remaining, Bird made a buzzer-beating running shot to win the game, 140–139</span>
				<span class='text'> In Game 7 of the 1988 Eastern Conference semifinals against the [[Atlanta Hawks]], Bird shot 9 of 10 from the floor in the fourth quarter, scoring 20 points in that quarter and lifting the Celtics to a series-clinching victory over Atlanta</span>
				<span class='text'>Bird finished with 34 points</span>
				<span class='text'>This effort helped to overcome a 47-point performance by [[Dominique Wilkins]] also in the game</span>
				<span class='text'> On March 31, 1991, the Celtics played a double overtime game with the [[Chicago Bulls]] in their last meeting of the season</span>
				<span class='text'>In the second overtime period, Bird scored 9 points on 4 of 5 shooting from the field and helped the Celtics beat the Bulls, 135–132</span>
				<span class='text'>Many called this particular game Bird's finest performance against [[Michael Jordan]]</span>
				<span class='text'> In the last seconds of a nationally-televised regular season game with the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] in March 1992, Bird sent the game into overtime with an off balance running one-handed three-point shot</span>
				<span class='text'>Bird tallied 49 points, 14 rebounds, 12 assists and 4 steals for his 59th and final career triple-double in what many fans called his last great game in the NBA</span>
				<span class='text'>The Celtics won in double overtime over the Blazers, 152–148</span>
				<span class='text'>Bird's 49 points stands as the 3rd highest scoring game while registering a triple-double</span>
				<span class='text'> [[Michael Jordan]] once was asked who he would want to take a shot with the game on the line, other than himself</span>
				<span class='text'>Before the question could be finished, Jordan quickly responded, &quot;Larry Bird</span>

				<span class='text'>At Fenway Park that day, the [[Boston Red Sox]] were playing the [[Los Angeles Angels]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Roger Clemens]], the Red Sox starting pitcher, had a small 33 on his hat as a tribute to Larry Bird</span>
				<span class='text'>Angels manager John Wathan immediately protested, saying it did not meet regulations</span>
				<span class='text'>The crowd booed relentlessly, chanting the words, &quot;Larry, Larry, Larry</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;  Clemens threw his hat into the dugout in disgust when told it was not allowed</span>

				<span class='text'>Bird also set the franchise record for most points scored in a quarter with 24 points in the third quarter which has since been equaled by Todd Day against the Minnesota Timberwolves on December 22, 1995</span>

				<span class='text'>The first was on February 14, 1986 in an overtime win against the Portland Trail Blazers</span>
