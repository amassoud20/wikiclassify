				<span class='text'>The bodies of Gagarin and Seryogin were cremated and the ashes were buried in the [[Kremlin Wall Necropolis|walls of the Kremlin]] on [[Red Square]]</span>
				<span class='text'>agarin was survived by his wife Valentina, and daughters Yelena and Galina</span>
				<span class='text'>Yelena Yurievna Gagarina, Yuri's elder daughter, is an art historian who has worked as the [[director-general]] of the [[Moscow Kremlin]] Museums since 2001</span>

				<span class='text'>oviet documents declassified in March 2003 showed that the [[KGB]] had conducted their own investigation of the accident, in addition to one government and two military investigations</span>
				<span class='text'>The KGB's report dismissed various conspiracy theories, instead indicating that the actions of airbase personnel contributed to the crash</span>
				<span class='text'>The report states that an [[air traffic controller]] provided Gagarin with outdated weather information, and that by the time of his flight, conditions had deteriorated significantly</span>
				<span class='text'>Ground crew also left external fuel tanks attached to the aircraft</span>
				<span class='text'>Gagarin's planned flight activities needed clear weather and no outboard tanks</span>
				<span class='text'>The investigation concluded that Gagarin's aircraft entered a [[spin (flight)|spin]], either due to a [[bird strike]] or because of a sudden move to avoid another aircraft</span>
				<span class='text'>Because of the out-of-date weather report, the crew believed their altitude to be higher than it actually was, and could not react properly to bring the MiG-15 out of its spin</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph080801&quot;/&gt;Another theory, advanced by the original crash investigator in 2005, hypothesizes that a cabin air vent was accidentally left open by the crew or the previous pilot, leading to [[oxygen deprivation]] and leaving the crew incapable of controlling the aircraft</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ScotlandSunday-GagarinInquiry&quot;/&gt; A similar theory, published in ''Air &amp; Space'' magazine, is that the crew detected the open vent and followed procedure by executing a rapid dive to a lower altitude</span>
				<span class='text'>This dive caused them to lose consciousness and crash</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;airspace20100901&quot;/&gt;On 12 April 2007, the Kremlin vetoed a new investigation into the death of Gagarin</span>
				<span class='text'>Government officials said that they saw no reason to begin a new investigation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;belfast171&quot;/&gt;In April 2011, documents from a 1968 commission set up by the Central Committee of the Communist Party to investigate the accident were declassified</span>
				<span class='text'>Those documents revealed that the commission's original conclusion was that Gagarin or Seryogin had maneuvered sharply either to avoid a weather balloon, leading the jet into a &quot;super-critical flight regime and to its stalling in complex meteorological conditions,&quot; or to avoid &quot;entry into the upper limit of the first layer of cloud cover&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;afp20110408&quot;/&gt;In his 2004 book ''Two Sides of the Moon'', [[Alexey Leonov]], who was part of a State Commission established to investigate the death in 1968, recounts that he was flying a helicopter in the same area that day when he heard &quot;two loud booms in the distance</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Corroborating other theories, his conclusion is that a Sukhoi jet (which he identifies as a [[Sukhoi Su-15|Su-15 'Flagon']]) was flying below its minimum allowed altitude, and &quot;without realizing it because of the terrible weather conditions, he passed within 10 or 20 meters of Yuri and Seregin's plane while breaking the sound barrier</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The resulting turbulence would have sent the MiG into an uncontrolled spin</span>
				<span class='text'>Leonov believes the first boom he heard was that of the jet breaking the sound barrier, and the second was Gagarin's plane crashing</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;LeonovBook&quot;/&gt; In a June 2013 interview with Russian television network [[RT (TV network)|RT]], Leonov said that a declassified report on the incident revealed the presence of a second, &quot;unauthorized&quot; Su-15 flying in the area</span>
				<span class='text'>Leonov states that this aircraft had descended to {{convert|450|m}} and that, while running afterburners, &quot;the aircraft reduced its echelon at a distance of 10‚Äì15 meters in the clouds, passing close to Gagarin, turning his plane and thus sending it into a tailspin ‚Äì a deep spiral, to be precise ‚Äì at a speed of 750 kilometers per hour</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; As a condition of being allowed to discuss the report, however, Leonov was required to not disclose the name of the other pilot, who was reported to be 80 years old (as of 2013) and in poor health</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;bbc20110307&quot;/&gt; Many commented on how Gagarin's smile gained the attention of crowds on the frequent tours he did in the months after the Vostok 1 mission success</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;French1998&quot; /&gt;Gagarin also garnered a reputation as an adept public figure</span>
				<span class='text'>When he visited [[Manchester]] in the United Kingdom, it was pouring rain</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Gagarin insisted that the car hood remain back so that the cheering crowds could catch a glimpse of him</span>
				<span class='text'>Gagarin stated, &quot;If all these people have turned out to welcome me and can stand in the rain, so can I</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Gagarin refused an [[umbrella]] and remained standing in his open-top [[Bentley]] so that the cheering crowds could still see him</span>
