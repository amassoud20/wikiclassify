				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|First contract of Eli Whitney as a firearms manufacturer, 1798</span>
				<span class='text'>Signed by [[Oliver Wolcott, Jr</span>
				<span class='text'>], [[Secretary of the Treasury]]</span>
				<span class='text'>]Eli Whitney has often been incorrectly credited with inventing the idea of interchangeable parts, which he championed for years as a maker of [[musket]]s; however, the idea predated Whitney, and Whitney's role in it was one of promotion and popularizing, not invention</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Successful implementation of the idea eluded Whitney until near the end of his life, occurring first in others' armories</span>
				<span class='text'>ttempts at interchangeability of parts can be traced back as far as the [[Punic Wars]] through both archaeological remains of boats now in Museo Archeologico Baglio Anselmi and contemporary written accounts</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} In modern times the idea developed over decades among many people</span>
				<span class='text'>An early leader was [[Jean-Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval]], an 18th-century French [[artillery|artillerist]] who created a fair amount of [[standardization]] of artillery pieces, although not true interchangeability of parts</span>
				<span class='text'>He inspired others, including [[Honoré Blanc]] and [[Louis de Tousard]], to work further on the idea, and on shoulder weapons as well as artillery</span>
				<span class='text'>In the 19th century these efforts produced the &quot;armory system,&quot; or [[American system of manufacturing]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Certain other New Englanders, including [[Captain John H</span>
				<span class='text'>Hall]] and [[Simeon North]], arrived at successful interchangeability before Whitney's armory did</span>
				<span class='text'>The Whitney armory finally succeeded not long after his death in 1825</span>
				<span class='text'>he motives behind Whitney's acceptance of a contract to manufacture muskets in 1798 were mostly monetary</span>
				<span class='text'>By the late 1790s, Whitney was on the verge of bankruptcy and the cotton gin litigation had left him deeply in [[debt]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His [[New Haven]] cotton gin factory had burned to the ground, and litigation sapped his remaining resources</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[French Revolution]] had ignited new conflicts between Great Britain, France, and the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>The new American government, realizing the need to prepare for war, began to rearm</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[United States Department of War|War Department]] issued contracts for the manufacture of 10,000 muskets</span>
				<span class='text'>Whitney, who had never made a gun in his life, obtained a contract in January 1798 to deliver 10,000 to 15,000 muskets in 1800</span>
				<span class='text'>He had not mentioned interchangeable parts at that time</span>
				<span class='text'> Ten months later, the Treasury Secretary, [[Oliver Wolcott, Jr</span>
				<span class='text'>], sent him a &quot;foreign pamphlet on arms manufacturing techniques,&quot; possibly one of Honoré Blanc's reports, after which Whitney first began to talk about interchangeability</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Eli Whitney Gun Factory William Giles Munson 1827</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|250px|Whitney's gun factory in 1827]]In May 1798, Congress voted for legislation that would use eight hundred thousand dollars in order to pay for small arms and cannons in case war with France erupted</span>
				<span class='text'>They offered a 5,000 dollar incentive with an additional 5,000 dollars once that money was exhausted for the person that was able to accurately produce arms for the government</span>
				<span class='text'>Because the cotton gin had not brought Whitney the rewards he believed he would get, he accepted the contract</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the contract was for one year, Whitney did not deliver the arms until eight years later in 1809 using multiple excuses for the delay of such</span>
				<span class='text'>Recently, historians have found that during 1801–1806, Whitney took the money and headed into South Carolina in order to profit from the cotton gin</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Baida1987&quot;/&gt;Although Whitney's demonstration of 1801 appeared to show the ingenuity of interchangeable parts, [[Merritt Roe Smith]] concludes that Whitney's demonstration was &quot;staged&quot; and &quot;duped government authorities&quot; into believing that he had created interchangeable parts</span>
				<span class='text'>The charade was only useful in order to gain more time and resources for the project but not to create interchangeable parts</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Baida1987&quot;/&gt;When the government complained that Whitney's price per musket compared unfavorably with those produced in government armories, Whitney was able to calculate an actual price per musket by including [[fixed cost]]s such as insurance and [[machinery]], which the government had not included</span>
				<span class='text'>He thus made early contributions to both the concept of [[cost accounting]], and the concept of the [[efficiency (economics)|efficiency]] of private industry</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|A cotton gin on display at the [[Eli Whitney Museum]]</span>
				<span class='text'>]The cotton gin is a mechanical device that removes the seeds from cotton, a process that had previously been extremely labor-intensive</span>
				<span class='text'>The word ''gin'' is short for ''engine</span>
				<span class='text'>' The cotton gin was a wooden drum stuck with hooks that pulled the cotton fibers through a mesh</span>
				<span class='text'>The cotton seeds would not fit through the mesh and fell outside</span>
				<span class='text'>Whitney occasionally told a story wherein he was pondering an improved method of seeding the cotton when he was inspired by observing a cat attempting to pull a chicken through a fence, and could only pull through some of the feathers</span>
				<span class='text'> single cotton gin could generate up to {{convert|55|lb}} of cleaned cotton daily</span>
				<span class='text'>This contributed to the economic development of the [[Southern United States|Southern states]] of the United States, a prime cotton growing area; some historians believe that this invention allowed for the [[History of slavery in the United States|African slavery system]] in the Southern United States to become more sustainable at a critical point in its development</span>
				<span class='text'>hitney received a patent (later numbered as X72) for his cotton gin on March 14, 1794, but it was not validated until 1807</span>
				<span class='text'>Whitney and his partner, Miller, did not intend to sell the gins</span>
				<span class='text'>Rather, like the proprietors of [[gristmill|grist]] and [[sawmill]]s, they expected to charge farmers for cleaning their cotton – two-fifths of the value, paid in cotton</span>
				<span class='text'>Resentment at this scheme, the mechanical simplicity of the device and the primitive state of [[History of patent law|patent law]], made [[Patent infringement|infringement]] inevitable</span>
				<span class='text'>Whitney and Miller could not build enough gins to meet demand, so gins from other makers found ready sale</span>
				<span class='text'>Ultimately, patent infringement lawsuits consumed the profits and their cotton gin company went out of business in 1797</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;MIT&quot; /&gt; One oft-overlooked point is that there were drawbacks to Whitney's first design</span>
				<span class='text'>There is significant evidence that the design flaws were solved by a plantation owner, [[Catherine Littlefield Greene]], wife of the [[American Revolutionary War]] general [[Nathanael Greene]]; Whitney gave her no public credit or recognition</span>
