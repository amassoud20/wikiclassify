				<span class='text'>Locke was the first to define the self through a continuity of ''[[consciousness]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>He postulated that, at birth, the [[mind]] was a blank slate or ''[[tabula rasa]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>His mother was Agnes Keene</span>
				<span class='text'>Both parents were [[Puritan]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>Locke was born on 29 August 1632, in a small thatched [[cottage]] by the church in [[Wrington]], Somerset, about twelve miles from [[Bristol]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was [[baptism|baptised]] the same day</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon after Locke's birth, the family moved to the [[market town]] of [[Pensford]], about seven miles south of Bristol, where Locke grew up in a rural [[Tudor architecture|Tudor]] house in [[Belluton]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1647, Locke was sent to the prestigious [[Westminster School]] in London under the sponsorship of [[Alexander Popham]], a member of Parliament and his father's former commander</span>
				<span class='text'>After completing his studies there, he was admitted to [[Christ Church, Oxford]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The dean of the college at the time was [[John Owen (theologian)|John Owen]], vice-chancellor of the university</span>
				<span class='text'>Although a capable student, Locke was irritated by the undergraduate curriculum of the time</span>
				<span class='text'>He found the works of modern philosophers, such as [[René Descartes]], more interesting than the [[classics|classical]] material taught at the university</span>
				<span class='text'>Through his friend [[Richard Lower (physician)|Richard Lower]], whom he knew from the Westminster School, Locke was introduced to medicine and the experimental philosophy being pursued at other universities and in the [[Royal Society]], of which he eventually became a member</span>
				<span class='text'>ocke was awarded a [[bachelor's degree]] in 1656 and a master's degree in 1658</span>
				<span class='text'>He obtained a [[bachelor of medicine]] in 1674, having studied medicine extensively during his time at [[Oxford]] and worked with such noted scientists and thinkers as [[Robert Boyle]], [[Thomas Willis]], [[Robert Hooke]] and Richard Lower</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1666, he met Lord [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury]], who had come to Oxford seeking treatment for a [[liver]] infection</span>
				<span class='text'>Cooper was impressed with Locke and persuaded him to become part of his retinue</span>
				<span class='text'>ocke had been looking for a career and in 1667 moved into Shaftesbury's home at Exeter House in London, to serve as Lord Ashley's personal physician</span>
				<span class='text'>In London, Locke resumed his medical studies under the tutelage of [[Thomas Sydenham]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Sydenham had a major effect on Locke's natural philosophical thinking{{spaced ndash}}an effect that would become evident in ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]</span>
				<span class='text'>'Locke's medical knowledge was put to the test when Shaftesbury's liver infection became life-threatening</span>
				<span class='text'>Locke coordinated the advice of several physicians and was probably instrumental in persuading Shaftesbury to undergo an operation (then life-threatening itself) to remove the cyst</span>
				<span class='text'>Shaftesbury survived and prospered, crediting Locke with saving his life</span>
				<span class='text'>uring this time, Locke served as Secretary of the [[Board of Trade|Board of Trade and Plantations]] and Secretary to the [[Lords Proprietor|Lords Proprietor of Carolina]], which helped to shape his ideas on international trade and economics</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Locke-John-LOC</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|upright|John Locke]]Shaftesbury, as a founder of the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] movement, exerted great influence on Locke's political ideas</span>
				<span class='text'>Locke became involved in politics when Shaftesbury became [[Lord Chancellor]] in 1672</span>
				<span class='text'>Following Shaftesbury's fall from favour in 1675, Locke spent some time travelling across France as tutor and medical attendant to [[Caleb Banks]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Around this time, most likely at Shaftesbury's prompting, Locke composed the bulk of the ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>While it was once thought that Locke wrote the Treatises to defend the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, recent scholarship has shown that the work was composed well before this date</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Laslett | 1988 | loc = III</span>
				<span class='text'>''Two Treatises of Government'' and the Revolution of 1688}} The work is now viewed as a more general argument against [[absolute monarchy]] (particularly as espoused by [[Robert Filmer]] and [[Thomas Hobbes]]) and for individual consent as the basis of [[political legitimacy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Though Locke was associated with the influential Whigs, his ideas about [[natural and legal rights|natural rights]] and government are today considered quite revolutionary for that period in English history</span>
				<span class='text'>ocke fled to the [[Netherlands]] in 1683, under strong suspicion of involvement in the [[Rye House Plot]], although there is little evidence to suggest that he was directly involved in the scheme</span>
				<span class='text'>The philosopher and novelist [[Rebecca Newberger Goldstein]] argues that during his five years in Holland, Locke chose his friends &quot;from among the same freethinking members of dissenting Protestant groups as [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza's]] small group of loyal confidants</span>
				<span class='text'>[Baruch Spinoza had died in 1677</span>
				<span class='text'> Locke almost certainly met men in Amsterdam who spoke of the ideas of that renegade Jew who</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>insisted on identifying himself through his religion of reason alone</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; While she says that &quot;Locke's strong empiricist tendencies&quot; would have &quot;disinclined him to read a grandly metaphysical work such as Spinoza's [[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]], in other ways he was deeply receptive to Spinoza's ideas, most particularly to the rationalist's well thought out argument for political and religious tolerance and the necessity of the separation of church and state</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Newberger Goldstein, ''Betraying Spinoza: The Renegade Jew Who Gave Us Modernity'', New York: Schocken Books (2006), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>260–61&lt;/ref&gt;In the Netherlands, Locke had time to return to his writing, spending a great deal of time re-working the ''Essay'' and composing the ''Letter on Toleration</span>
				<span class='text'>' Locke did not return home until after the [[Glorious Revolution]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Locke accompanied [[William III of England|William of Orange]]'s wife back to England in 1688</span>
				<span class='text'>The bulk of Locke's publishing took place upon his return from exile{{spaced ndash}}his aforementioned ''Essay Concerning Human Understanding'', the ''Two Treatises of Civil Government'' and ''[[A Letter Concerning Toleration]]'' all appearing in quick succession</span>
				<span class='text'>ocke's close friend [[Lady Masham]] invited him to join her at the Mashams' country house in Essex</span>
				<span class='text'>Although his time there was marked by variable health from [[asthma]] attacks, he nevertheless became an intellectual hero of the Whigs</span>
				<span class='text'>During this period he discussed matters with such figures as [[John Dryden]] and [[Isaac Newton]]</span>
				<span class='text'>e died on 28 October 1704, and is buried in the churchyard of the village of [[High Laver]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Britannica Online | contribution = John Locke}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; east of [[Harlow]] in Essex, where he had lived in the household of Sir Francis Masham since 1691</span>
				<span class='text'>Locke never married nor had children</span>
				<span class='text'>vents that happened during Locke's lifetime include the [[English Restoration]], the [[Great Plague of London]] and the [[Great Fire of London]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He did not quite see the [[Act of Union 1707|Act of Union of 1707]], though the thrones of England and Scotland were held in [[personal union]] throughout his lifetime</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Constitutional monarchy]] and [[parliamentary democracy]] were in their infancy during Locke's time</span>
				<span class='text'>=Influence==In the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, Locke's ''Two Treatises'' were not frequently cited</span>
				<span class='text'>The historian Julian Hoppit said of the book, &quot;except among some Whigs, even as a contribution to the intense debate of the 1690s it made little impression and was generally ignored until 1703 (though in Oxford in 1695 it was reported to have made 'a great noise')&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Julian Hoppit, ''A Land of Liberty? England</span>
				<span class='text'>1689–1727'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 2000), p</span>
				<span class='text'>195</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; [[John Philipps Kenyon|John Kenyon]] in his study of British political debate from 1689 to 1720, has remarked that Locke's theories were &quot;mentioned so rarely in the early stages of the [Glorious] Revolution, up to 1692, and even less thereafter, unless it was to heap abuse on them&quot; and that &quot;no one, including most Whigs, [were] ready for the idea of a notional or abstract contract of the kind adumbrated by Locke&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;John Kenyon, ''Revolution Principles</span>
				<span class='text'>The Politics of Party</span>
				<span class='text'>1689–1720'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1977), p</span>
				<span class='text'>200</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Kenyon adds that [[Algernon Sidney]]'s ''Discourses Concerning Government'' were &quot;certainly much more influential than Locke's ''Two Treatises''&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kenyon, p</span>
				<span class='text'>51</span>
				<span class='text'>Kenyon adds: &quot;Any unbiassed study of the position shows in fact that it was Filmer, not Hobbes, Locke or Sidney, who was the most influential thinker of the age&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Kenyon, p</span>
				<span class='text'>63</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In the fifty years after Queen Anne's death in 1714, the ''Two Treatises'' were reprinted only once (apart from in the collected works of Locke)</span>
				<span class='text'>However, with the rise of American resistance to British taxation, the ''Second Treatise'' gained a new readership; it was frequently cited in the debates in both America and Britain</span>
				<span class='text'>The first American printing occurred in 1773 in Boston</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Locke exercised a profound influence on political philosophy, in particular on modern liberalism</span>
				<span class='text'>Michael Zuckert has argued that Locke launched liberalism by tempering Hobbesian absolutism and clearly [[separation of church and state|separating the realms of Church and State]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He had a strong influence on [[Voltaire]] who called him &quot;le sage Locke&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>His arguments concerning [[liberty]] and the [[social contract]] later influenced the written works of [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[James Madison]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], and other [[Founding Fathers of the United States]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In fact, one passage from the ''Second Treatise'' is reproduced verbatim in the Declaration of Independence, the reference to a &quot;long train of abuses</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Such was Locke's influence that Thomas Jefferson wrote: &quot;[[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], Locke and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Locke redefined subjectivity, or self, and intellectual historians such as [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] and Jerrold Seigel argue that Locke's ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1690) marks the beginning of the modern Western conception of the self</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Theories of religious tolerance===Locke, writing his ''Letters Concerning Toleration'' (1689–92) in the aftermath of the [[European wars of religion]], formulated a classic reasoning for religious tolerance</span>
				<span class='text'>Three arguments are central: (1) Earthly judges, the state in particular, and human beings generally, cannot dependably evaluate the truth-claims of competing religious standpoints; (2) Even if they could, enforcing a single &quot;true religion&quot; would not have the desired effect, because belief cannot be compelled by violence; (3) Coercing religious uniformity would lead to more social disorder than allowing diversity</span>

				<span class='text'>214–5</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;With regard to his position on religious tolerance, Locke was influenced by [[Baptist]] theologians like [[John Smyth (Baptist minister)|John Smyth]] and [[Thomas Helwys]], who had published tracts demanding freedom of conscience in the early seventeenth century</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Heussi | 1956}}{{Sfn | Olmstead | 1960 | p = 18}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | language = German | first = H | last = Stahl | contribution = Baptisten | title = Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart | year = 1957}}, 3</span>

				<span class='text'>863&lt;/ref&gt;  Baptist theologian [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] founded the colony [[Rhode Island]] in 1636, where he combined a democratic constitution with unlimited religious freedom</span>
				<span class='text'>His tract ''[[The Bloody Tenent of Persecution for Cause of Conscience]]'' (1644), which was widely read in the mother country, was a passionate plea for absolute religious freedom and the total separation of church and state</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Olmstead | 1960 | pp = 102–5}}  Freedom of conscience had had high priority on the theological, philosophical and political agenda, since [[Martin Luther]] refused to recant his beliefs before the Diet of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] at Worms in 1521, unless he would be proved false by the Bible</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Olmstead | 1960 | p = 5}}===Constitution of Carolina===Appraisals of Locke have often been tied to appraisals of liberalism in general, and also to appraisals of the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>Detractors note that (in 1671) he was a major investor in the English slave-trade through the [[Royal African Company]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, he participated in drafting the ''[[Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina]]'' while [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury|Shaftesbury]]'s secretary, which established a feudal aristocracy and gave a master absolute power over his slaves</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, [[Martin Cohen (philosopher)|Martin Cohen]] notes that Locke, as a secretary to the Council of Trade and Plantations (1673–4) and a member of the Board of Trade (1696–1700), was in fact, &quot;one of just half a dozen men who created and supervised both the colonies and their iniquitous systems of servitude&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Collectively, these documents are known as the [[Grand Model for the Province of Carolina]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==Theory of value and property===Locke uses the word ''property'' in both broad and narrow senses</span>
				<span class='text'>In a broad sense, it covers a wide range of human interests and aspirations; more narrowly, it refers to material goods</span>

				<span class='text'>This position can be seen as a [[labour theory of value]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=labortheory/&gt;From this premise, Locke developed a [[labour theory of property]], namely that ownership of [[property]] is created by the application of labour</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, he believed that property precedes government and government cannot &quot;dispose of the estates of the subjects arbitrarily</span>

				<span class='text'>However, Locke never refers to Hobbes by name and may instead have been responding to other writers of the day</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Skinner | first = Quentin | title = Visions of Politics | place = Cambridge}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Locke also advocated governmental [[separation of powers]] and believed that revolution is not only a [[Right of revolution|right]] but an obligation in some circumstances</span>

				<span class='text'>In his view, the introduction of money eliminates the limits of accumulation</span>
				<span class='text'>Locke stresses that inequality has come about by tacit agreement on the use of money, not by the social contract establishing civil society or the law of land regulating property</span>
				<span class='text'>Locke is aware of a problem posed by unlimited accumulation but does not consider it his task</span>
				<span class='text'>He just implies that government would function to moderate the conflict between the unlimited accumulation of property and a more nearly equal distribution of wealth; he does not identify which principles that government should apply to solve this problem</span>
				<span class='text'>However, not all elements of his thought form a consistent whole</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, [[labour theory of value]] of the ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'' stands side by side with the demand-and-supply theory developed in a letter he wrote titled ''Some Considerations on the Consequences of the Lowering of Interest and the Raising of the Value of Money''</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, Locke anchors property in labour but in the end upholds the unlimited accumulation of wealth</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = John | last = Locke | year = 1691 | url = http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>tm | title = Some Considerations on the consequences of the Lowering of Interest and the Raising of the Value of Money | publisher = Marxists}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He refers to supply as &quot;quantity&quot; and demand as &quot;[[Economic rent|rent]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;The price of any commodity rises or falls by the proportion of the number of buyer and sellers,&quot; and &quot;that which regulates the price</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>[of goods] is nothing else but their quantity in proportion to their rent</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The quantity theory of money forms a special case of this general theory</span>
				<span class='text'>His idea is based on &quot;money answers all things&quot; (Ecclesiastes) or &quot;rent of money is always sufficient, or more than enough,&quot; and &quot;varies very little</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Locke concludes that as far as money is concerned, the demand is exclusively regulated by its quantity, regardless of whether the [[demand for money]] is unlimited or constant</span>
				<span class='text'>He also investigates the determinants of demand and supply</span>
				<span class='text'>For supply, he explains the value of goods as based on their scarcity and ability to be exchanged and consumed</span>
				<span class='text'>He explains demand for goods as based on their ability to yield a flow of income</span>
				<span class='text'>Locke develops an early theory of [[Capital (economics)|capitalisation]], such as land, which has value because &quot;by its constant production of saleable commodities it brings in a certain yearly income</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He considers the demand for money as almost the same as demand for goods or land; it depends on whether money is wanted as medium of exchange</span>
				<span class='text'>As a medium of exchange, he states that &quot;money is capable by exchange to procure us the necessaries or conveniences of life,&quot; and for loanable funds, &quot;it comes to be of the same nature with land by yielding a certain yearly income</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>or interest</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;====Monetary thoughts====Locke distinguishes two functions of money, as a &quot;counter&quot; to measure value, and as a &quot;pledge&quot; to lay claim to [[good (economics)|goods]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He believes that silver and gold, as opposed to paper money, are the appropriate currency for international transactions</span>
				<span class='text'>Silver and gold, he says, are treated to have equal value by all of humanity and can thus be treated as a pledge by anyone, while the value of paper money is only valid under the government which issues it</span>
				<span class='text'>ocke argues that a country should seek a favourable [[balance of trade]], lest it fall behind other countries and suffer a loss in its trade</span>
				<span class='text'>Since the world money stock grows constantly, a country must constantly seek to enlarge its own stock</span>
				<span class='text'>Locke develops his theory of foreign exchanges, in addition to commodity movements, there are also movements in country stock of money, and movements of capital determine exchange rates</span>
				<span class='text'>He considers the latter less significant and less volatile than commodity movements</span>
				<span class='text'>As for a country's [[money supply|money stock]], if it is large relative to that of other countries, he says it will cause the country's exchange to rise above par, as an export balance would do</span>
				<span class='text'>e also prepares estimates of the [[cash]] requirements for different economic groups (landholders, labourers and brokers)</span>
				<span class='text'>In each group he posits that the cash requirements are closely related to the length of the pay period</span>
				<span class='text'>He argues the brokers&amp;nbsp;– middlemen&amp;nbsp;– whose activities enlarge the monetary circuit and whose profits eat into the earnings of labourers and landholders, have a negative influence on both personal and the public economy to which they supposedly contribute</span>
				<span class='text'>==The self===Locke defines the self as &quot;that conscious thinking thing, (whatever substance, made up of whether spiritual, or material, simple, or compounded, it matters not) which is sensible, or conscious of pleasure and pain, capable of happiness or misery, and so is concerned for itself, as far as that consciousness extends&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Locke | 1997 | p = 307}}  He does not, however, ignore &quot;substance&quot;, writing that &quot;the body too goes to the making the man</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{Sfn | Locke | 1997 | p = 306}}In his ''Essay'', Locke explains the gradual unfolding of this conscious mind</span>
				<span class='text'>Arguing against both the [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian]] view of man as [[original sin|originally sinful]] and the [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] position, which holds that man innately knows basic logical propositions, Locke posits an &quot;empty&quot; mind, a ''tabula rasa'', which is shaped by experience; [[Wikt:sensation|sensations]] and [[human self-reflection|reflections]] being the two sources of '''all''' our [[idea]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The American International Encyclopedia | publisher = JJ Little Co | place = New York | year = 1954 | volume = 9}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Locke's ''[[Some Thoughts Concerning Education]]'' is an outline on how to educate this mind: he expresses the belief that education maketh the man, or, more fundamentally, that the mind is an &quot;empty cabinet&quot;, with the statement, &quot;I think I may say that of all the men we meet with, nine parts of ten are what they are, good or evil, useful or not, by their education</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{Sfn | Locke | 1996 | p = 10}}Locke also wrote that &quot;the little and almost insensible impressions on our tender infancies have very important and lasting consequences</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{Sfn | Locke | 1996 | p = 10}}  He argued that the &quot;[[Association of Ideas|associations of ideas]]&quot; that one makes when young are more important than those made later because they are the foundation of the self: they are, put differently, what first mark the ''tabula rasa''</span>
				<span class='text'>In his ''Essay'', in which both these concepts are introduced, Locke warns against, for example, letting &quot;a foolish maid&quot; convince a child that &quot;goblins and sprites&quot; are associated with the night for &quot;darkness shall ever afterwards bring with it those frightful ideas, and they shall be so joined, that he can no more bear the one than the other</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{Sfn | Locke | 1997 | p = 357}}&quot;Associationism&quot;, as this theory would come to be called, exerted a powerful influence over eighteenth-century thought, particularly [[education theory|educational theory]], as nearly every educational writer warned parents not to allow their children to develop negative associations</span>
				<span class='text'>It also led to the development of [[psychology]] and other new disciplines with [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley]]'s attempt to discover a biological mechanism for associationism in his ''[[Observations on Man]]'' (1749)</span>
				<span class='text'>=Religious beliefs==Some scholars have seen Locke's political convictions as deriving from his religious beliefs</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Greg | last = Forster | title = John Locke's politics of moral consensus | year = 2005}}</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Locke's religious trajectory began in [[Calvinist]] [[trinitarianism]], but by the time of the ''Reflections'' (1695) Locke was advocating not just [[Socinianism|Socinian]] views on tolerance but also Socinian Christology</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Marshall 1994 426&quot;&gt;{{Citation | first = John | last = Marshall | title = John Locke: resistance, religion and responsibility | place = Cambridge | year = 1994 | page = 426}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; However Wainwright (1987) notes that in the posthumously published ''Paraphrase'' (1707) Locke's interpretation of one verse, Ephesians 1:10, is markedly different from that of Socinians like [[John Biddle (Unitarian)|Biddle]], and may indicate that near the end of his life Locke returned nearer to an [[Arian]] position, thereby accepting Christ's pre-existence</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Locke | 1987 | p = 806}}  In fact, historian [[John Marshall (historian)|John Marshall]] suggests that Locke's view of Christ ended, &quot;somewhere between Socianism and Arianism</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Marshall 1994 426&quot;/&gt;Locke was at times not sure about the subject of [[original sin]], so he was accused of Socianism, Arianism, or Deism</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Waldron | 2002 | pp = 27, 223}}  But he did not deny the reality of evil</span>
				<span class='text'>Man was capable of waging unjust wars and committing crimes</span>
				<span class='text'>Criminals had to be punished, even with the death penalty</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Waldron | 2002 | p = 145}}  With regard to the Bible Locke was very conservative</span>
				<span class='text'>He retained the doctrine of the [[verbal inspiration]] of the Scriptures</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Heussi | 1956}}  The miracles were proofs of the divine nature of the biblical message</span>
				<span class='text'>Locke was convinced that the entire content of the Bible was in agreement with human reason (''The reasonableness of Christianity'', 1695)</span>

				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Waldron | 2002 | p = 13}}  In Locke's opinion the [[cosmological argument]] was valid and proved God's existence</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;{{Sfn | Waldron | 2002 | pp = 142}}  Like the two other very influential natural-law philosophers, [[Hugo Grotius]] and [[Samuel Pufendorf]], Locke equated [[natural law]] with the biblical [[revelation]], since in their view both had originated in God and could therefore not contradict each other</span>

				<span class='text'>721&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;As a philosopher, Locke was intensely interested in Christian doctrine, and in the ''Reasonableness'' he insisted that most men could not hope to understand the detailed requirements of the law of nature without the assistance of the teachings and example of Jesus</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{Sfn | Waldron | 2002 | p = 12}}  Locke derived the fundamental concepts of his political theory from biblical texts, in particular from [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1 and 2 ([[Genesis creation narrative|creation]]), the [[Ten Commandments|Decalogue]] ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 20), the [[Golden Rule]] ([http://www</span>
				<span class='text'>iblegateway</span>
				<span class='text'>om/passage/?search=  Matthew 7:12]), the teachings of [[Jesus]] (e</span>

				<span class='text'>his doctrine of [[charity (virtue)|charity]], [http://www</span>
				<span class='text'>iblegateway</span>
				<span class='text'>om/passage/?search= Matthew 19:19]), and the letters of [[Paul the Apostle]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Waldron | 2002 | pp = 22–43, 45–46, 101, 153–58, 195, 197}}  The Decalogue (Ten Commandments) puts a person's life, his or her honourable reputation (i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>honour and dignity), and property under God's protection</span>
				<span class='text'>Freedom is another major theme in the Old Testament</span>
				<span class='text'>For instance, God's actions in liberating the Israelites from Egyptian slavery in the Decalogue's prologue ([http://www</span>
				<span class='text'>iblegateway</span>
				<span class='text'>om/passage/?search= Exodus 20:2]) were the precondition for the following commandments</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, Locke derived basic human equality, including the [[equality of the sexes]] (&quot;Adam and Eve&quot;) from [http://www</span>
				<span class='text'>iblegateway</span>
				<span class='text'>om/passage/?search=Genesis+1%3A26-28&amp;version=NIV Genesis 1:26–28], the starting point of the theological doctrine of [[Imago Dei]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Waldron | 2002 | pp = 21–43}}  To Locke, one of the consequences of the principle of equality was that all humans were created equally free and therefore governments needed the consent of the governed</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Waldron | 2002 | p = 136}}  Only when Locke had derived the fundamental aspects of his concept of man and ethics from the biblical texts – life, equality, private property, etc</span>
				<span class='text'>–, did he examine as a philosopher which consequences they had in the abovementioned way</span>
				<span class='text'>Following Locke, the American Declaration of Independence founded [[human rights]] on the biblical belief in creation: &quot;All men are ''created'' equal, (</span>
