				<span class='text'>Her younger half-brother [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] (son of Henry and [[Jane Seymour]]) succeeded their father in 1547</span>
				<span class='text'>When Edward became mortally ill in 1553, he attempted to remove Mary from the line of succession because of religious differences</span>
				<span class='text'>On his death their first cousin once removed, [[Lady Jane Grey]], was initially proclaimed queen</span>

				<span class='text'>s the fourth crowned monarch of the [[Tudor dynasty]], Mary is remembered for her restoration of Roman Catholicism after the short-lived Protestant reign of her half-brother</span>

				<span class='text'>12–13; Weir, pp</span>

				<span class='text'>13, 37; Waller, p</span>
				<span class='text'>17&lt;/ref&gt; Henry VIII's cousin once removed, [[Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury]], stood sponsor for Mary's [[confirmation]], which was held immediately after the baptism</span>

				<span class='text'>13; Waller, p</span>
				<span class='text'>17; Whitelock, p</span>
				<span class='text'>7&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Mary became a godmother herself when she was named as one of the sponsors of her cousin [[Frances Grey, Duchess of Suffolk|Frances Brandon]]</span>

				<span class='text'>23&lt;/ref&gt;]]Mary was a precocious child</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Whitelock, p</span>
				<span class='text'>27&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1520, when scarcely four and a half years old, she entertained a visiting French delegation with a performance on the [[virginals]] (a type of [[harpsichord]])</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Loades, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>19–20; Porter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>21&lt;/ref&gt; A great part of her early education came from her mother, who consulted the Spanish [[humanism|humanist]] [[Juan Luis Vives]] for advice and commissioned him to write ''De Institutione Feminae Christianae'', a treatise on the education of girls</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Loades, p</span>
				<span class='text'>31; Porter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>30&lt;/ref&gt; By the age of nine, Mary could read and write Latin</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Porter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>28; Whitelock, p</span>
				<span class='text'>27&lt;/ref&gt; She studied French, Spanish, music, dance, and perhaps Greek</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Loades, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>32, 43&lt;/ref&gt; Henry VIII doted on his daughter and boasted to the Venetian ambassador Sebastian Giustiniani, &quot;This girl never cries&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Domine Orator, per Deum immortalem, ista puella nunquam plorat'', quoted in Whitelock, p</span>
				<span class='text'>17&lt;/ref&gt; Also, as the miniature portrait of her shows, Mary had, like both her parents, a very fair complexion, pale blue eyes and red or reddish-golden hair</span>
				<span class='text'>She was also ruddy cheeked, a trait she inherited from her father</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Giles Tremlett, &quot;Catherine of Aragon, Henry's Spanish Queen&quot; p</span>
				<span class='text'>44&lt;/ref&gt;Despite his affection for Mary, Henry was deeply disappointed that his marriage had produced no sons</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tittler, p</span>
				<span class='text'>1&lt;/ref&gt; By the time Mary was nine years old, it was apparent that Henry and Catherine would have no more children, leaving Henry without a legitimate male heir</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Loades, p</span>
				<span class='text'>37; Porter, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>38–39; Whitelock, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>32–33&lt;/ref&gt; In 1525, Henry sent Mary to the border of [[Wales]] to preside, presumably in name only, over the [[Council of Wales and the Marches]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Porter, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>38–39; Whitelock, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>32–33&lt;/ref&gt; She was given her own [[Court (royal)|court]] based at [[Ludlow Castle]] and many of the [[royal prerogative]]s normally reserved for the [[Prince of Wales]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Vives and others called her the [[Princess of Wales]], although she was never technically invested with the title</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Waller, p</span>
				<span class='text'>23&lt;/ref&gt; She appears to have spent three years in the [[Welsh Marches]], making regular visits to her father's court, before returning permanently to the [[home counties]] around London in mid-1528</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Loades, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>41–42, 45&lt;/ref&gt;Throughout Mary's childhood, Henry negotiated potential future marriages for her</span>
				<span class='text'>When she was only two years old, she was promised to the [[Francis III, Duke of Brittany|Dauphin]], the infant son of [[Francis I of France|King Francis I of France]], but the contract was repudiated after three years</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Porter, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>20–21; Waller, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>20–21; Whitelock, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>18–23&lt;/ref&gt; In 1522, at the age of six, she was instead contracted to marry her 22-year-old first cousin, [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Loades, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>22–23; Porter, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>21–24; Waller, p</span>
				<span class='text'>21; Whitelock, p</span>
				<span class='text'>23&lt;/ref&gt; However, the engagement was broken off within a few years by Charles with Henry's agreement</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Whitelock, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>30–31&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Wolsey|Cardinal Wolsey]], Henry's chief adviser, then resumed marriage negotiations with the French, and Henry suggested that Mary marry the Dauphin's father, King Francis I himself, who was eager for an alliance with England</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Whitelock, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>36–37&lt;/ref&gt; A marriage treaty was signed which provided that Mary marry either Francis I or his second son [[Henry II of France|Henry, Duke of Orleans]],&lt;ref&gt;Whitelock, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>37–38&lt;/ref&gt; but Wolsey secured an alliance with France without the marriage</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] Mario Savorgnano, Mary was developing into a pretty, well-proportioned young lady with a fine complexion</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Mario Savorgnano, 25 August 1531, ''Calendar of State Papers, Venetian'', vol</span>
				<span class='text'>IV, p</span>
				<span class='text'>682, quoted in Loades, p</span>
				<span class='text'>63&lt;/ref&gt;==Adolescence==Meanwhile, the marriage of Mary's parents was in jeopardy</span>
				<span class='text'>Disappointed at the lack of a male heir, and eager to remarry, Henry attempted to have his marriage to Catherine [[annulment|annulled]], but [[Pope Clement VII]] refused his requests</span>
				<span class='text'>Henry claimed, citing biblical passages ([[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]] 20:21), that his marriage to Catherine was unclean because she was the widow of his brother (Mary's uncle) [[Arthur, Prince of Wales|Arthur]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Catherine claimed that her marriage to Arthur was never [[consummate]]d, and so was not a valid marriage</span>
				<span class='text'>Indeed, her first marriage had been annulled by a previous pope, [[Pope Julius II|Julius II]], on that basis</span>
				<span class='text'>Clement may have been reluctant to act because he was influenced by Charles V, Catherine's nephew and Mary's former betrothed, whose troops had [[Sack of Rome (1527)|surrounded and occupied Rome]] in the [[War of the League of Cognac]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Porter, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>56, 78; Whitelock, p</span>
				<span class='text'>40&lt;/ref&gt;From 1531, Mary was often sick with irregular menstruation and depression, although it is not clear whether this was caused by stress, puberty or a more deep-seated disease</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Waller, p</span>
				<span class='text'>27&lt;/ref&gt; She was not permitted to see her mother, who had been sent to live away from court by Henry</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Porter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>76; Whitelock, p</span>
				<span class='text'>48&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1533, Henry married [[Anne Boleyn]], who was pregnant with his child, and in May [[Thomas Cranmer]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], formally declared the marriage with Catherine void, and the marriage to Anne valid</span>
				<span class='text'>Henry broke with the Roman Catholic Church and declared himself Supreme Head of the [[Church of England]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Catherine was demoted to Dowager Princess of Wales (a title she would have held as the widow of Arthur), and Mary was deemed illegitimate</span>
				<span class='text'>She was styled &quot;The Lady Mary&quot; rather than Princess, and her place in the line of succession was transferred to her newborn half-sister, [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]], Anne's daughter</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Porter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>92; Whitelock, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>55–56&lt;/ref&gt; Mary's own household was dissolved;&lt;ref&gt;Loades, p</span>
				<span class='text'>77; Porter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>92; Whitelock, p</span>
				<span class='text'>57&lt;/ref&gt; her servants (including the Countess of Salisbury) were dismissed and in December 1533 she was sent to join the household of the infant Elizabeth at [[Hatfield, Hertfordshire]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Loades, p</span>
				<span class='text'>78; Whitelock, p</span>
				<span class='text'>57&lt;/ref&gt;Mary determinedly refused to acknowledge that Anne was the queen or that Elizabeth was a princess, further enraging King Henry</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Porter, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>97–101; Whitelock, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>55–69&lt;/ref&gt; Under strain and with her movements restricted, Mary was frequently ill, which the royal physician attributed to her &quot;ill treatment&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Dr [[William Butts]], quoted in Waller, p</span>
				<span class='text'>31&lt;/ref&gt; The Imperial ambassador [[Eustace Chapuys]] became her close adviser, and interceded, unsuccessfully, on her behalf at court</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Loades, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>84–85&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between Mary and her father worsened; they did not speak to each other for three years</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Porter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>100&lt;/ref&gt; Although both she and her mother were ill, Mary was refused permission to visit Catherine</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Porter, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>103–104; Whitelock, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>67–69, 72&lt;/ref&gt; When Catherine died in 1536, Mary was &quot;inconsolable&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Letter from Emperor Charles V to [[Isabella of Portugal|Empress Isabella]], quoted in Whitelock, p</span>
				<span class='text'>75&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine was interred in [[Peterborough Cathedral]] while Mary grieved in semi-seclusion at [[Hunsdon]] in Hertfordshire</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Porter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>107; Whitelock, p</span>
				<span class='text'>76–77&lt;/ref&gt;==Adulthood==In 1536, Queen Anne fell from the king's favour and was beheaded</span>
				<span class='text'>Elizabeth, like Mary, was downgraded to the status of Lady and [[Second Succession Act|removed from the line of succession]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Whitelock, p</span>
				<span class='text'>91&lt;/ref&gt; Within two weeks of Anne's execution, Henry married [[Jane Seymour]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Jane urged her husband to make peace with Mary</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Porter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>121; Waller, p</span>
				<span class='text'>33; Whitelock, p</span>
				<span class='text'>81&lt;/ref&gt; Henry insisted that Mary recognise him as head of the Church of England, repudiate [[papal authority]], acknowledge that the marriage between her parents was unlawful, and accept her own illegitimacy</span>
				<span class='text'>She attempted to reconcile with him by submitting to his authority as far as &quot;God and my conscience&quot; permitted, but she was eventually bullied into signing a document agreeing to all of Henry's demands</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Porter, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>119–123; Waller, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>34–36; Whitelock, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>83–89&lt;/ref&gt; Reconciled with her father, Mary resumed her place at court</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Porter, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>119–123; Waller, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>34–36; Whitelock, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>90–91&lt;/ref&gt; Henry granted her a household (which included the reinstatement of Mary's favourite [[Susan Clarencieux]])</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Loades, p</span>
				<span class='text'>105&lt;/ref&gt; Her privy purse expenses for this period show that [[Hatfield House]], the [[Palace of Beaulieu]] (also called Newhall), [[Richmond, North Yorkshire|Richmond]] and [[Hunsdon]] were among her principal places of residence, as well as Henry's palaces at Greenwich, [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]] and [[Hampton Court Palace|Hampton Court]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Porter, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>129–132; Whitelock, p</span>
				<span class='text'>28&lt;/ref&gt; Rebels in the North of England, including Lord Hussey, Mary's former chamberlain, campaigned against Henry's religious reforms, and one of their demands was that Mary be made legitimate</span>
				<span class='text'>The rebellion, known as the [[Pilgrimage of Grace]], was ruthlessly suppressed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Porter, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>124–125&lt;/ref&gt; Along with other rebels, Hussey was executed, but there was no suggestion that Mary was directly involved</span>

				<span class='text'>108&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, 1537, Jane died after giving birth to a son, [[Edward VI of England|Edward]]</span>

				<span class='text'>101&lt;/ref&gt; Over 1539, the king's chief minister, [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Thomas Cromwell]], negotiated a potential alliance with the [[Duchy of Cleves]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Suggestions that Mary marry the [[William, Duke of Jülich-Cleves-Berg|Duke of Cleves]], who was the same age, came to nothing, but a match between Henry and the Duke's sister [[Anne of Cleves|Anne]] was agreed</span>

				<span class='text'>126–127; Whitelock, p</span>
				<span class='text'>101&lt;/ref&gt; When the king saw Anne for the first time in late December 1539, a week before the scheduled wedding, he did not find her attractive but was unable, for diplomatic reasons and in the absence of a suitable pretext, to cancel the marriage</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Whitelock, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>103–104&lt;/ref&gt; Cromwell fell from favour and was arrested for treason in June 1540; one of the unlikely charges against him was that he had plotted to marry Mary himself</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Whitelock, p</span>
				<span class='text'>105&lt;/ref&gt; Anne consented to the annulment of the marriage, which had not been consummated, and Cromwell was beheaded</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Whitelock, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>105–106&lt;/ref&gt;In 1541, Henry had the Countess of Salisbury, Mary's old governess and godmother, executed on the pretext of a Catholic plot, in which her son ([[Reginald Pole]]) was implicated</span>

				<span class='text'>130&lt;/ref&gt; Since Edward was still a child, rule passed to a regency council dominated by Protestants, who attempted to establish their faith throughout the country</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, the [[Act of Uniformity 1549]] prescribed Protestant rites for church services, such as the use of [[Thomas Cranmer]]'s new ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Mary remained faithful to Roman Catholicism, and defiantly celebrated the traditional mass in her own chapel</span>

				<span class='text'>144–147&lt;/ref&gt; Religious differences between Mary and Edward continued</span>
				<span class='text'>When Mary was in her thirties, she attended a reunion with Edward and Elizabeth for Christmas 1550, where 13-year-old Edward embarrassed Mary, and reduced both her and himself to tears in front of the court, by publicly reproving her for ignoring his laws regarding worship</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Porter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>178; Whitelock, p</span>
				<span class='text'>149&lt;/ref&gt; Mary repeatedly refused Edward's demands that she abandon Catholicism, and Edward repeatedly refused to drop his demands</span>

				<span class='text'>148–160&lt;/ref&gt;==Accession==On 6 July 1553, at the age of 15, Edward VI died from a lung infection, possibly tuberculosis</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Porter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>187&lt;/ref&gt; He did not want the crown to go to Mary because he feared she would restore Catholicism and undo his reforms, as well as those of Henry VIII, and so he planned to exclude her from the line of succession</span>
				<span class='text'>His advisers, however, told him that he could not disinherit only one of his sisters, but that he would have to disinherit Elizabeth as well, even though she embraced the Church of England</span>
				<span class='text'>Guided by [[John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland]], and perhaps others, Edward excluded both of his sisters from the line of succession in his will</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Porter, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>188–189&lt;/ref&gt;Contradicting the [[Third Succession Act|Succession Act]], which restored Mary and Elizabeth to the line of succession, Edward named Dudley's daughter-in-law [[Lady Jane Grey]], the granddaughter of Henry VIII's younger sister [[Mary Tudor, Queen of France|Mary]], as his successor</span>
				<span class='text'>Lady Jane's mother was [[Frances Grey, Duchess of Suffolk|Frances Brandon]], who was Mary's cousin and goddaughter</span>
				<span class='text'>Just before Edward VI's death, Mary was summoned to London to visit her dying brother</span>
				<span class='text'>She was warned, however, that the summons was a pretext on which to capture her and thereby facilitate Lady Jane's accession to the throne</span>

				<span class='text'>48–49; Whitelock, p</span>
				<span class='text'>165&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of heading to London from her residence at Hunsdon, Mary fled into [[East Anglia]], where she owned extensive estates and Dudley had ruthlessly put down [[Kett's Rebellion]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Many adherents to the Catholic faith, opponents of Dudley, lived there</span>

				<span class='text'>168&lt;/ref&gt;On 10 July 1553, Lady Jane was proclaimed queen by Dudley and his supporters, and on the same day Mary's letter to the council arrived in London</span>
				<span class='text'>By 12 July, Mary and her supporters had assembled a military force at [[Framlingham Castle]], Suffolk</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Porter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>203; Waller, p</span>
				<span class='text'>52&lt;/ref&gt; Dudley's support collapsed, and Mary's grew</span>

				<span class='text'>210; Weir, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>159–160&lt;/ref&gt; She and Dudley were imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Mary rode triumphantly into London on 3 August 1553 on a wave of popular support</span>
				<span class='text'>She was accompanied by her half-sister Elizabeth, and a procession of over 800 nobles and gentlemen</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Waller, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>57–59&lt;/ref&gt;One of Mary's first actions as queen was to order the release of the Roman Catholic [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]] and [[Stephen Gardiner]] from imprisonment in the Tower of London, as well as her kinsman [[Edward Courtenay, 1st Earl of Devon (1553 creation)|Edward Courtenay]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Waller, p</span>
				<span class='text'>59; Whitelock, p</span>
				<span class='text'>181&lt;/ref&gt; Mary understood that the young Lady Jane was essentially a pawn in Dudley's scheme, and Dudley was the only conspirator of rank executed for [[high treason]] in the immediate aftermath of the coup</span>
				<span class='text'>Lady Jane and her husband, [[Lord Guildford Dudley]], though found guilty, were kept under guard in the Tower rather than immediately executed, while Lady Jane's father, [[Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk]], was released</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Waller, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>59–60; Whitelock, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>185–186&lt;/ref&gt; Mary was left in a difficult position, as almost all the [[Privy Council of England|Privy Counsellors]] had been implicated in the plot to put Lady Jane on the throne</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Whitelock, p</span>
				<span class='text'>182&lt;/ref&gt; She appointed Gardiner to the council and made him both [[Bishop of Winchester]] and [[Lord Chancellor]], offices he held until his death in November 1555</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Susan Clarencieux]] became [[Mistress of the Robes]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Whitelock, p</span>

				<span class='text'>195–197&lt;/ref&gt;===Spanish marriage===[[File:Philip II</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|Philip of Spain by [[Titian]]]]At age 37, Mary turned her attention to finding a husband and producing an heir, thus preventing the Protestant Elizabeth (still next-in-line under the terms of [[Henry VIII's will]] and the [[Act of Succession of 1544]]) from succeeding to the throne</span>
				<span class='text'>Edward Courtenay and Reginald Pole were both mentioned as prospective suitors, but her cousin Charles V suggested she marry his only son, [[Philip II of Spain|Prince Philip of Spain]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Loades, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>199–201; Porter, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>265–267&lt;/ref&gt; Philip had a [[Charles, Prince of Asturias|son]] from a previous marriage, and was heir apparent to vast territories in Continental Europe and the New World</span>
				<span class='text'>As part of the marriage negotiations, a portrait of Philip by [[Titian]] was sent to her in September 1553</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Porter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>310&lt;/ref&gt;Lord Chancellor Gardiner and the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] unsuccessfully petitioned her to consider marrying an Englishman, fearing that England would be relegated to a dependency of the [[Habsburg]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Porter, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>279–284; Waller, p</span>
				<span class='text'>72; Whitelock, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>202–209&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage was unpopular with the English; Gardiner and his allies opposed it on the basis of patriotism, while Protestants were motivated by a fear of Catholicism</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Waller, p</span>
				<span class='text'>73&lt;/ref&gt; When Mary insisted on marrying Philip, insurrections broke out</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Thomas Wyatt the younger]] led a force from [[Kent]] to depose Mary in favour of Elizabeth, as part of a wider conspiracy now known as [[Wyatt's rebellion]], which also involved the [[Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk|Duke of Suffolk]], the father of Lady Jane</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Porter, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>288–299; Whitelock, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>212–213&lt;/ref&gt; Mary declared publicly that she would summon Parliament to discuss the marriage, and if Parliament decided that the marriage was not to the advantage of the kingdom, she would refrain from pursuing it</span>

				<span class='text'>300; Waller, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>74–75; Whitelock, p</span>
				<span class='text'>216&lt;/ref&gt; On reaching London, Wyatt was defeated and captured</span>
				<span class='text'>Wyatt, the Duke of Suffolk, his daughter Lady Jane, and her husband [[Guildford Dudley]] were executed</span>
				<span class='text'>Courtenay, who was implicated in the plot, was imprisoned, and then exiled</span>
				<span class='text'>Elizabeth, though protesting her innocence in the Wyatt affair, was imprisoned in the Tower of London for two months, then was put under house arrest at [[Woodstock Palace]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Porter, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>311–313; Whitelock, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>217–225&lt;/ref&gt;Mary was—excluding the brief, disputed reigns of the [[Empress Matilda]] and Lady Jane Grey—England's first [[queen regnant]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Further, under the English common law doctrine of ''[[jure uxoris]]'', the property and titles belonging to a woman became her husband's upon marriage, and it was feared that any man she married would thereby become King of England in fact and in name</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Waller, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>84–85; Whitelock, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>202, 227&lt;/ref&gt; While Mary's grandparents, [[Ferdinand and Isabella]], had retained sovereignty of their own realms during their marriage, there was no precedent to follow in England</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Porter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>269; Waller, p</span>
				<span class='text'>85&lt;/ref&gt; Under the terms of [[Act for the Marriage of Queen Mary to Philip of Spain|Queen Mary's Marriage Act]], Philip was to be styled &quot;King of England&quot;, all official documents (including [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]]) were to be dated with both their names, and Parliament was to be called under the joint authority of the couple, for Mary's lifetime only</span>
				<span class='text'>England would not be obliged to provide military support to Philip's father in any war, and Philip could not act without his wife's consent or appoint foreigners to office in England</span>

				<span class='text'>308–309; Whitelock, p</span>
				<span class='text'>229&lt;/ref&gt; He had no amorous feelings toward Mary and sought the marriage for its political and strategic gains; Philip's aide [[Ruy Gómez de Silva]] wrote to a correspondent in Brussels, &quot;the marriage was concluded for no fleshly consideration, but in order to remedy the disorders of this kingdom and to preserve the [[Low Countries]]</span>

				<span class='text'>92–93&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament passed an [[Treason Act 1554|act making Philip regent]] in the event of Mary's death in childbirth</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Loades, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>234–235&lt;/ref&gt; In the last week of April 1555, Elizabeth was released from house arrest, and called to court as a witness to the birth, which was expected imminently</span>

				<span class='text'>338; Waller, p</span>
				<span class='text'>95; Whitelock, p</span>
				<span class='text'>255&lt;/ref&gt; According to Giovanni Michieli, the Venetian ambassador, Philip may have planned to marry Elizabeth in the event of Mary's death in childbirth,&lt;ref&gt;Waller, p</span>
				<span class='text'>96&lt;/ref&gt; but in a letter to his brother-in-law, [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian of Austria]], Philip expressed uncertainty as to whether his wife was pregnant</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;&quot;The queen's pregnancy turns out not to have been as certain as we thought&quot;: Letter of 25 April 1554, quoted in Porter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>337 and Whitelock, p</span>
				<span class='text'>257&lt;/ref&gt;Thanksgiving services in the [[diocese of London]] were held at the end of April after false rumours that Mary had given birth to a son spread across Europe</span>

				<span class='text'>95; Whitelock, p</span>
				<span class='text'>256&lt;/ref&gt; Through May and June, the apparent delay in delivery fed gossip that Mary was not pregnant</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Whitelock, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>257–259&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susan Clarencieux]] revealed her doubts to the French ambassador, [[Antoine de Noailles]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Whitelock, p</span>
				<span class='text'>258&lt;/ref&gt; Mary continued to exhibit signs of pregnancy until July 1555, when her abdomen receded</span>
				<span class='text'>There was no baby</span>
				<span class='text'>Michieli dismissively ridiculed the pregnancy as more likely to &quot;end in wind rather than anything else&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Waller, p</span>
				<span class='text'>97; Whitelock, p</span>
				<span class='text'>259&lt;/ref&gt; It was most likely a [[false pregnancy]], perhaps induced by Mary's overwhelming desire to have a child</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Porter, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>337–338; Waller, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>97–98&lt;/ref&gt; In August, soon after the disgrace of the false pregnancy, which Mary considered to be &quot;God's punishment&quot; for her having &quot;tolerated [[Heresy|heretics]]&quot; in her realm,&lt;ref&gt;PBS Video&lt;/ref&gt; Philip left England to command his armies against France in [[Flanders]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Porter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>342&lt;/ref&gt; Mary was heartbroken and fell into a deep depression</span>
				<span class='text'>Michieli was touched by the queen's grief; he wrote she was &quot;extraordinarily in love&quot; with her husband, and was disconsolate at his departure</span>

				<span class='text'>98–99; Whitelock, p</span>
				<span class='text'>268&lt;/ref&gt;Elizabeth remained at court until October, apparently restored to favour</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Antoine de Noailles quoted in Whitelock, p</span>
				<span class='text'>269&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of any children, Philip was concerned that after Mary and Elizabeth, one of the next claimants to the English throne was the [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Queen of Scots]], who was betrothed to the [[Francis II of France|Dauphin of France]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip persuaded Mary that Elizabeth should marry his cousin, [[Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy]], to secure the Catholic succession and preserve the Habsburg interest in England, but Elizabeth refused to comply and parliamentary consent was unlikely</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Foreign policy===Furthering the [[Tudor conquest of Ireland]], under Mary's reign English colonists were settled in the [[Irish Midlands]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[County Laois|Queen's]] and [[County Offaly|King's Counties]] (now Counties Laois and Offaly) were founded, and their [[Plantations of Ireland|plantation]] began</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tittler, p</span>
				<span class='text'>66&lt;/ref&gt; Their principal towns were respectively named Maryborough (now [[Portlaoise]]) and Philipstown (now [[Daingean]])</span>
				<span class='text'>n January 1556, Mary's father-in-law abdicated and Philip became King of Spain, with Mary as his consort</span>
				<span class='text'>They were still apart; Philip was declared king in Brussels, but Mary stayed in England</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip negotiated an unsteady truce with the French in February 1556</span>
				<span class='text'>The following month, the French ambassador in England, [[Antoine de Noailles]], was implicated in a plot against Mary when Sir [[Henry Sutton Dudley|Henry Dudley]], a second cousin of the executed [[John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland|Duke of Northumberland]], attempted to assemble an invasion force in France</span>
				<span class='text'>The plot, known as the Dudley conspiracy, was betrayed, and the conspirators in England were rounded up</span>
				<span class='text'>Dudley remained in exile in France, and Noailles prudently left Britain</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Porter, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>381–387&lt;/ref&gt;Philip returned to England from March to July 1557 to persuade Mary to support Spain in a [[Italian War of 1551–1559|renewed war against France]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Mary was in favour of declaring war, but her councillors opposed it because French trade would be jeopardised, it contravened the marriage treaty, and a bad economic legacy from Edward VI's reign and a series of poor harvests meant England lacked supplies and finances</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Whitelock, p</span>
				<span class='text'>288&lt;/ref&gt; War was only declared in June 1557 after Reginald Pole's nephew, [[Thomas Stafford (rebel)|Thomas Stafford]], invaded England and seized [[Scarborough Castle]] with French help in a failed attempt to depose Mary</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Porter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>389; Waller, p</span>
				<span class='text'>111; Whitelock, p</span>
				<span class='text'>289&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the war, relations between England and the Papacy became strained, since [[Pope Paul IV]] was allied with [[Henry II of France]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Whitelock, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>293–295&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1558, French forces took [[Calais]], England's sole remaining possession on the European mainland</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the territory was financially burdensome, it was an ideological loss that damaged Mary's prestige</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Loades, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>295–297; Porter, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>392–395; Whitelock, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>291–292&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Holinshed's Chronicles]], Mary later lamented, &quot;When I am dead and opened, you shall find 'Calais' lying in my heart&quot;, although this may be apocryphal</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Porter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>393&lt;/ref&gt;===Commerce and revenue===The years of Mary's reign were consistently wet</span>
				<span class='text'>The persistent rain and subsequent flooding led to famine</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Porter, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>229, 375; Whitelock, p</span>
				<span class='text'>277&lt;/ref&gt; Another problem was the decline of the [[Antwerp]] cloth trade</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tittler, p</span>
				<span class='text'>48&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Mary's marriage to Philip, England did not benefit from [[Kingdom of Spain|Spain]]'s enormously lucrative trade with the [[Spanish Empire|New World]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tittler, p</span>
				<span class='text'>49&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish guarded their trade routes jealously, and Mary could not condone [[smuggling|illicit trade]] or [[piracy]] against her husband</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tittler, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>49–50&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to increase trade and rescue the English economy, Mary's counsellors continued [[John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland|Northumberland]]'s policy of seeking out new commercial opportunities</span>
				<span class='text'>She granted a [[royal charter]] to the [[Muscovy Company]], whose first governor was [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian Cabot]],&lt;ref&gt;Porter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>371&lt;/ref&gt; and commissioned a world atlas from [[Diogo Homem]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Porter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>373&lt;/ref&gt; Adventurers such as [[John Lok]] and [[William Towerson]] sailed south in an attempt to develop links with the coast of Africa</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Porter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>372&lt;/ref&gt;Financially, Mary's regime tried to reconcile a modern form of government—with correspondingly higher spending—with a medieval system of collecting taxation and dues</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Porter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>375; Tittler, p</span>
				<span class='text'>51&lt;/ref&gt; Mary retained the Edwardian appointee [[William Paulet, 1st Marquess of Winchester]], as [[Lord High Treasurer]] and assigned him to oversee the revenue collection system</span>
				<span class='text'>A failure to apply new [[tariff]]s to new forms of imports meant that a key source of revenue was neglected</span>
				<span class='text'>To solve this problem, Mary's government published a revised &quot;Book of Rates&quot; (1558), which listed the tariffs and [[duty|duties]] for every import</span>
				<span class='text'>This publication was not extensively reviewed until 1604</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Porter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>376&lt;/ref&gt;English coinage was debased under both Henry VIII and Edward VI</span>
				<span class='text'>Mary drafted plans for currency reform but they were not implemented until after her death</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Porter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>376; Tittler, p</span>
				<span class='text'>53&lt;/ref&gt;==Death==[[File:Mary1 by Eworth 3</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|Portrait by [[Hans Eworth]]]]After Philip's visit in 1557, Mary thought herself pregnant again with a baby due in March 1558</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Porter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>98; Waller, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>106, 112; Whitelock, p</span>
				<span class='text'>299&lt;/ref&gt; She decreed in her will that her husband be the regent during the minority of her child</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Whitelock, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>299–300&lt;/ref&gt; However, no child was born, and Mary was forced to accept that Elizabeth was her lawful successor</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Whitelock, p</span>
				<span class='text'>301&lt;/ref&gt;Mary was weak and ill from May 1558</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Loades, p</span>
				<span class='text'>305; Whitelock, p</span>
				<span class='text'>300&lt;/ref&gt; In pain, possibly from [[ovarian cyst]]s or [[uterine cancer]],&lt;ref&gt;Waller, p</span>
				<span class='text'>108&lt;/ref&gt; she died on 17 November 1558 aged 42 at [[St</span>
				<span class='text'>James's Palace]], during an [[influenza]] epidemic that also claimed the life of [[Reginald Pole]] later the same day</span>
				<span class='text'>She was succeeded by her half-sister</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip, who was in Brussels, wrote to his sister [[Joan of Austria, Princess of Portugal|Joan]]: &quot;I felt a reasonable regret for her death</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Letter from the King of Spain to the [[Joan of Austria, Princess of Portugal|Princess of Portugal]], 4 December 1558, in ''Calendar of State Papers, Spanish'', volume XIII, quoted in Loades, p</span>
				<span class='text'>311; Waller, p</span>
				<span class='text'>109 and Whitelock, p</span>
				<span class='text'>303&lt;/ref&gt;Although her will stated that she wished to be buried next to her mother, Mary was interred in [[Westminster Abbey]] on 14 December in a tomb she would eventually share with Elizabeth</span>
				<span class='text'>The Latin inscription on their tomb, ''Regno consortes et urna, hic obdormimus Elizabetha et Maria sorores, in spe resurrectionis'' (affixed there by [[James I of England|James I]] when he succeeded Elizabeth) translates to &quot;Consorts in realm and tomb, here we sleep, Elizabeth and Mary, sisters, in hope of resurrection&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Porter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>410; Whitelock, p</span>
				<span class='text'>1&lt;/ref&gt;==Legacy=={{See also|Cultural depictions of Mary I of England}}At her funeral service, [[John White (bishop)|John White]], [[bishop of Winchester]], praised Mary: &quot;She was a king's daughter; she was a king's sister; she was a king's wife</span>
				<span class='text'>She was a queen, and by the same title a king also</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Loades, p</span>
				<span class='text'>313; Whitelock, p</span>
				<span class='text'>305&lt;/ref&gt; She was the first woman to successfully claim the throne of England, despite competing claims and determined opposition, and enjoyed popular support and sympathy during the earliest parts of her reign, especially from the Roman Catholics of England</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Waller, p</span>
				<span class='text'>116&lt;/ref&gt; Catholic historians, such as [[John Lingard]], thought Mary's policies failed not because they were wrong but because she had too short a reign to establish them and because of natural disasters beyond her control</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Loades, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>340–341&lt;/ref&gt; However, her marriage to Philip was unpopular among her subjects and her religious policies resulted in deep-seated resentment</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Loades, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>342–343; Waller, p</span>
				<span class='text'>116&lt;/ref&gt; The military losses in France, poor weather, and failed harvests increased public discontent</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip spent most of his time abroad, while his wife remained in England, leaving her depressed at his absence and undermined by their inability to have children</span>
				<span class='text'>After Mary's death, he sought to marry Elizabeth but she refused him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Porter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>400&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty years later, he sent the [[Spanish Armada]] to overthrow her, without success</span>
				<span class='text'>y the seventeenth century, Mary's persecution of Protestants had led to her sobriquet ''Bloody Mary''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Waller, p</span>
				<span class='text'>115&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Knox]] attacked her in his 1558 ''[[The First Blast of the Trumpet Against the Monstrous Regiment of Women|First Blast of the Trumpet against the Monstrous Regiment of Women]]'' and she was prominently featured and vilified in ''[[Actes and Monuments]]'', published by [[John Foxe]] in 1563, five years after her death</span>
				<span class='text'>Subsequent editions of the book remained popular with Protestants throughout the following centuries and helped shape enduring perceptions of Mary as a bloodthirsty tyrant</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Porter, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>361–362, 418; Waller, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>113–115&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-twentieth century, [[H</span>
				<span class='text'>F</span>
				<span class='text'>M</span>
				<span class='text'>Prescott]] attempted to redress the tradition that Mary was intolerant and authoritarian by writing more objectively, and scholarship since then has tended to view the older, simpler, partisan assessments of Mary with greater scepticism</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Weikel&lt;/ref&gt; Although Mary's rule was ultimately ineffectual and unpopular, the policies of fiscal reform, naval expansion, and colonial exploration that were later lauded as Elizabethan accomplishments were started in Mary's reign</span>

				<span class='text'>The title Supreme Head of the Church was repugnant to Mary's Catholicism, and she omitted it from Christmas 1553</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Loades, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>217, 323&lt;/ref&gt;Under Mary's marriage treaty with Philip, the official joint style reflected not only Mary's but also Philip's dominions and claims: &quot;Philip and Mary, by the grace of God, King and Queen of England, France, [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], [[Kings of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]], and Ireland, Defenders of the Faith, Princes of Spain and [[Sicily]], [[Archduke]]s of [[Austria]], Dukes of [[Rulers of Milan|Milan]], [[Duke of Burgundy|Burgundy]] and [[Duke of Brabant|Brabant]], Counts of [[Habsburg]], [[Count of Flanders|Flanders]] and [[German Tyrol|Tyrol]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=waller90/&gt; This style, which had been in use since 1554, was replaced when Philip inherited the Spanish Crown in 1556 with &quot;Philip and Mary, by the Grace of God King and Queen of England, Spain, France, both the Sicilies, Jerusalem and Ireland, Defenders of the Faith, Archdukes of Austria, Dukes of Burgundy, Milan and Brabant, Counts of Habsburg, Flanders and Tyrol&quot;</span>
