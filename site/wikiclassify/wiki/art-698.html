				<span class='text'>He became a [[naturalized]] citizen of the United States in 1934</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilder's first significant success was ''[[Ninotchka]]'' in 1939, a collaboration with fellow German immigrant [[Ernst Lubitsch]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This [[screwball comedy]] starred [[Greta Garbo]] (generally known as a [[tragedy|tragic]] heroine in film [[melodrama]]s), and was popularly and critically acclaimed</span>
				<span class='text'>With the byline, &quot;Garbo Laughs!&quot;, it also took Garbo's career in a new direction</span>
				<span class='text'>The film also marked Wilder's first [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination, which he shared with co-writer [[Charles Brackett]] (although their collaboration on ''[[Bluebeard's Eighth Wife]]'' and ''[[Midnight (1939 film)|Midnight]]'' had been well received)</span>
				<span class='text'>For twelve years Wilder co-wrote many of his films with Brackett, from 1938 through 1950</span>
				<span class='text'>He followed ''Ninotchka'' with a series of box office hits in 1942, including his ''[[Hold Back the Dawn]]'' and ''[[Ball of Fire]]'', as well as his directorial feature debut, ''[[The Major and the Minor]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>is third film as director, ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' (1944) was a major hit</span>
				<span class='text'>A ''[[film noir]]'', nominated for Best Director and Screenplay, it was co-written with mystery novelist [[Raymond Chandler]], although the two men did not get along</span>
				<span class='text'>''Double Indemnity'' not only set conventions for the ''noir'' genre (such as &quot;venetian blind&quot; lighting and voice-over narration), but was also a landmark in the battle against Hollywood censorship</span>
				<span class='text'>The original [[James M</span>
				<span class='text'>Cain]] novel ''Double Indemnity'' featured two love triangles and a murder plotted for insurance money</span>
				<span class='text'>While the book was highly popular with the reading public, it had been considered unfilmable under the [[Hays Code]], because adultery was central to its plot</span>
				<span class='text'>''Double Indemnity'' is credited by some as the first true film noir, combining the stylistic elements of ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' with the narrative elements of ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' (1941)</span>
				<span class='text'>uring the liberation of concentration camps in 1945, the [[Psychological Warfare Department]] (PWD) of the United States Department of War produced an American propaganda documentary film directed by Billy Wilder</span>
				<span class='text'>The film known as ''[[Death Mills]]'', or [[:de:Die Todesmühlen|''Die Todesmühlen'']], was intended for German audiences to educate them about the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime</span>
				<span class='text'>For the German version, Die Todesmühlen, Hanuš Burger is credited as the writer and director, while Wilder supervised the editing</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilder is credited with the English-language version</span>
				<span class='text'>{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}Two years later, Wilder earned the [[Academy Award for Directing|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay|Best Screenplay]] [[Academy Awards]] for the adaptation of a [[Charles R</span>
				<span class='text'>Jackson]] story ''[[The Lost Weekend (film)|The Lost Weekend]]'' (1945), the first major American film to make a serious examination of alcoholism, another difficult theme under the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Production Code]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1950, Wilder co-wrote and directed the dark and cynical ''[[Sunset Blvd</span>
				<span class='text'>(film)|Sunset Blvd</span>
				<span class='text'>]'', which paired rising star [[William Holden]] with [[Gloria Swanson]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Swanson played Norma Desmond, a reclusive silent film star who, with delusions of her greatness from a bygone era, dreams of a [[wikt:comeback|comeback]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Holden portrays an aspiring screenwriter who can't make ends meet and becomes a [[kept man]] to her</span>
				<span class='text'>It was critically acclaimed</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1951, Wilder followed ''Sunset Blvd</span>
				<span class='text'>' with ''[[Ace in the Hole (1951 film)|Ace in the Hole]]'' (a</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>''The Big Carnival''), a tale of media exploitation of a caving accident</span>
				<span class='text'>The idea for the film was pitched over the phone to Wilder's secretary by Victor Desny</span>
				<span class='text'>Desny successfully sued Wilder for breach of an implied contract in the influential California copyright case Wilder v Desny</span>

				<span class='text'>1956</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Although a critical and commercial failure at the time, its reputation has grown over the years</span>
				<span class='text'>n the fifties, Wilder also directed two adaptations of Broadway plays, the prisoner of war drama ''[[Stalag 17]]'' (1953), which resulted in a Best Actor Oscar for [[William Holden]], and the [[Agatha Christie]] mystery ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (1957 film)|Witness for the Prosecution]]'' (1957)</span>
				<span class='text'>In the mid-1950s, Wilder became interested in doing a film with one of the classic slapstick comedy acts of the Hollywood Golden Age</span>
				<span class='text'>He first considered, and rejected, a project to star [[Laurel and Hardy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He then held discussions with [[Groucho Marx]] concerning a new [[Marx Brothers]] comedy, tentatively titled &quot;A Day at the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot; This project was abandoned when [[Chico Marx]] died in 1961</span>

				<span class='text'>''The Fifty Greatest Movies Never Made'', New York: St</span>
				<span class='text'>Martin's Griffin&lt;/ref&gt;From the mid-1950s onwards, Wilder made mostly comedies</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;DavidCookhis&quot;/&gt; Among the classics Wilder created in this period are the farces ''[[The Seven Year Itch]]'' (1955) and ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' (1959), satires such as ''[[The Apartment]]'' (1960), and the romantic comedy ''[[Sabrina (1954 film)|Sabrina]]'' (1954)</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilder's humor is sometimes sardonic</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''[[Love in the Afternoon (1957 film)|Love in the Afternoon]]'' (1957), a young and innocent [[Audrey Hepburn]] does not wish to be young or innocent with playboy [[Gary Cooper]], and pretends to be a married woman in search of extramarital amusement</span>
				<span class='text'>The film was Wilder's first collaboration with writer-producer [[I</span>
				<span class='text'>A</span>
				<span class='text'>L</span>
				<span class='text'>Diamond]], an association that continued until the end of both men's careers</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1959, United Artists released Wilder's Prohibition-era farce ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' without a [[Motion Picture Production Code|Production Code]] seal of approval, withheld due to the film's unabashed sexual comedy, including a central cross-dressing theme</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Jack Lemmon]] and [[Tony Curtis]] play musicians who disguise themselves as women to escape pursuit by a Chicago gang</span>
				<span class='text'>Curtis's character courts a singer played by [[Marilyn Monroe]], while Lemmon is wooed by [[Joe E</span>

				<span class='text'>Brown]]—setting up the film's final joke in which Lemmon reveals that his character is a man and Brown blandly replies &quot;Well, nobody's perfect&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>fter winning three [[Academy Awards]] for 1960's ''[[The Apartment]]'' (for Best Picture, Director, and Screenplay), Wilder's career slowed</span>
				<span class='text'>His [[Cold War]] farce ''[[One, Two, Three]]'' (1961) featured a rousing comic performance by [[James Cagney]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It was followed by apparently lesser films that now are of cult status, such as ''[[Irma la Douce]]'' and ''[[Kiss Me, Stupid]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilder gained his last Oscar nomination for his screenplay ''[[The Fortune Cookie]]'' (UK: ''Meet Whiplash Willie'') (1966)</span>
				<span class='text'>His 1970 film ''[[The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes]]'' was intended as a major [[roadshow]] release, but was heavily cut by the studio and has never been fully restored</span>
				<span class='text'>Later films such as ''[[Fedora (film)|Fedora]]'' (1978) and ''[[Buddy Buddy]]'' (1981) failed to impress critics or the public</span>
				<span class='text'>fter that Wilder complained, futilely, that he was being discriminated against, due to his age</span>
				<span class='text'>For whatever reason, the studios were unwilling to hire him</span>
				<span class='text'>One &quot;consolation&quot; which Wilder had in his later years, besides his art collection (see &quot;Later Life,&quot; below), was the Andrew Lloyd Webber [[Sunset Boulevard (musical)|stage musical]] version of ''Sunset Blvd</span>
				<span class='text'>'</span>
				<span class='text'>{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}===Directorial style===&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Billy Wilder</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb]] --&gt;Wilder's directorial choices reflected his belief in the primacy of writing</span>
				<span class='text'>He avoided, especially in the second half of his career, the exuberant cinematography of [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and [[Orson Welles]] because, in Wilder's opinion, shots that called attention to themselves would distract the audience from the story</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilder's pictures have tight plotting and memorable dialogue</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite his conservative directorial style, his subject matter often pushed the boundaries of mainstream entertainment</span>
				<span class='text'>Once a subject was chosen, he would begin to visualize in terms of specific artists</span>
				<span class='text'>His belief was that no matter how talented the actor, none were without limitations and the end result would be better if you bent the script to their personality rather than force a performance beyond their limitations</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;&quot;One Head Is Better than Two,&quot; in Films and Filming (London), February 1957</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Wilder was skilled at working with actors, coaxing [[silent film|silent era]] legends [[Gloria Swanson]] and [[Erich von Stroheim]] out of retirement for roles in ''[[Sunset Blvd</span>
				<span class='text'>(film)|Sunset Blvd</span>
				<span class='text'>]''For ''[[Stalag 17]]'', Wilder squeezed an Oscar-winning performance out of a reluctant [[William Holden]] (Holden had wanted to make his character more likeable; Wilder refused)</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilder sometimes cast against type for major parts such as [[Fred MacMurray]] in ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' and ''[[The Apartment]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>MacMurray had become Hollywood's highest-paid actor portraying a decent, thoughtful character in light comedies, melodramas, and musicals; Wilder cast him as a womanizing schemer</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Humphrey Bogart]] shed his tough-guy image to give one of his warmest performances in ''[[Sabrina (1954 film)|Sabrina]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>[[James Cagney]], not usually known for comedy, was memorable in a high-octane comic role for Wilder's ''[[One, Two, Three]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilder coaxed a very effective performance out of [[Marilyn Monroe]] in ''[[Some Like It Hot]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}In total, he directed fourteen different actors in Oscar-nominated performances: [[Barbara Stanwyck]] in ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'', [[Ray Milland]] in ''[[The Lost Weekend (film)|The Lost Weekend]]'', [[William Holden]] in ''[[Sunset Blvd</span>

				<span class='text'>Milland, Holden and Matthau won Oscars for their performances in Wilder films</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilder mentored [[Jack Lemmon]] and was the first director to pair him with Walter Matthau, in ''[[The Fortune Cookie]]'' (1966)</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilder had great respect for Lemmon, calling him the hardest working actor he had ever met</span>
				<span class='text'>Lemmon starred in seven of Wilder's films</span>
				<span class='text'>ilder's work has had to meet some critical challenges</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he is admired by many critics and filmgoers, he has not won approval from noted critic [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]], author of ''A Biographical Dictionary of Film'', and other works</span>
				<span class='text'>Thomson summarizes his attitude toward Wilder by saying, &quot;I remain skeptical</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;David Thomson ''A Biographical Dictionary of Film'', London: Little, Brown, 2002, p</span>
				<span class='text'>36&lt;/ref&gt; Thomson emphasizes that, although Wilder created some brilliant films, he also directed some poor ones, especially at the end of his career</span>
				<span class='text'>Thomson notes that critic [[Andrew Sarris]] did not approve of Wilder for a long time but then changed his attitude much later</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Andrew Sarris, in ''The American Cinema: Directors and Directions 1929–1968'' (Da Capo, 1996 [originally published in 1968], p</span>
				<span class='text'>66) commented that Wilder is too &quot;cynical to believe even his own cynicism&quot; and referred to the &quot;superficial nastiness of his personality&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>''&quot;You Ain't Heard Nothin' Yet&quot;: The American Talking Film, History and Memory, 1927–1949'' (1998) contains Sarris's revised opinion</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Some{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} say that Wilder's films often lacked any discernible political tone or sympathies, which was not unintentional</span>
				<span class='text'>He was less interested in current political fashions than in human nature and the issues that confronted ordinary people</span>
				<span class='text'>He was not affected by the Hollywood blacklist, and had little sympathy for those who were</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Of the blacklisted '[[Hollywood blacklist|Hollywood Ten]]' Wilder famously quipped, &quot;Of the ten, two had talent, and the rest were just unfriendly&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>In general, Wilder had an intense dislike for formula and genre films</span>

				<span class='text'>7 No</span>
				<span class='text'>3 p</span>
				<span class='text'>180&lt;/ref&gt;Others say that his films derive their parodies from the politics of the world around him, capitalist and Communist, and that Wilder opposed the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC)</span>
				<span class='text'>He co-created the “Committee for the First Amendment”, of 500 Hollywood personalities and stars to “support those professionals called upon to testify before the HUAC who had classified themselves as hostile with regard to the interrogations and the interrogators”</span>
				<span class='text'>Some anti-Communists wanted those in the cinema industry to take oaths of allegiance</span>
				<span class='text'>The Screen Directors Guild had a vote by show of hands</span>
				<span class='text'>Only John Huston and Wilder opposed</span>
				<span class='text'>Huston said, “I am sure it was one of the bravest things that Billy, as a naturalized German, had ever done</span>
				<span class='text'>There were 150 to 200 directors at this meeting, and here Billy and I sat alone with our hands raised in protest against the loyalty oath”</span>

				<span class='text'>Wilder is sometimes confused with director [[William Wyler]]; the confusion is understandable, as both were German-speaking [[Jew]]s with similar backgrounds and names</span>
				<span class='text'>However, their output as directors was quite different, with Wyler preferring to direct epics and heavy dramas and Wilder noted for his comedies and [[film noir]] type dramas</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Wilder's artistic ambitions led him to create a series of works all his own</span>
				<span class='text'>By the early 90s, Wilder had amassed a beguiling assortment of plastic-artistic constructions, many of which were made in collaboration with artist Bruce Houston</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1993, art dealer Louis Stern, a longtime friend, helped organize an exhibition of Wilder's work at his Beverly Hills gallery</span>
				<span class='text'>The exhibition was titled ''Billy Wilder's Marché aux Puces'' and the ''Variations on the Theme of Queen Nefertete'' segment was an unqualified crowd pleaser</span>
				<span class='text'>This series featured busts of the ravishing Egyptian queen wrapped ''a la [[Christo]]'' or splattered ''a la [[Jackson Pollock]]'' or sporting a Campbell's soup can in homage to [[Warhol]]</span>
