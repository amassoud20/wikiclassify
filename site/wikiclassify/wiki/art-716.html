				<span class='text'>He was known in his time as '''Basil the [[Porphyrogenitus]]''' and '''Basil the Young''' to distinguish him from his supposed ancestor, [[Basil&amp;nbsp;I the Macedonian]]</span>
				<span class='text'>he early years of his long reign were dominated by civil war against powerful generals from the [[Anatolia]]n aristocracy</span>
				<span class='text'>Following their submission, Basil oversaw the stabilization and expansion of the eastern frontier of the [[Byzantine Empire]], and above all, the final and complete subjugation of [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], the Empire's foremost European foe, after a prolonged struggle</span>
				<span class='text'>For this he was nicknamed the '''Bulgar Slayer''' ({{lang-el|Βουλγαροκτόνος}}, ''Boulgaroktonos''), by which he is popularly known</span>
				<span class='text'>At his death, the Empire stretched from southern Italy to the Caucasus and from the Danube to the borders of Palestine, its greatest territorial extent since the [[Muslim conquests]] four centuries earlier</span>
				<span class='text'>espite near-constant warfare, Basil also showed himself a capable administrator, reducing the power of the [[dynatoi|great land-owning families]] who dominated the Empire's administration and military, while filling the Empire's treasury</span>

				<span class='text'>His biography represents that city (Sparta) – of which the contemporary Empress Theophano, wife of Romanos&amp;nbsp;II and Nikephoros Phokas, was perhaps a native</span>
				<span class='text'>}}&lt;/ref&gt; His paternal ancestry is of uncertain origins, his putative ancestor [[Basil I]], the founder of the dynasty, being variously attributed as [[Armenians|Armenian]], Slavic, or Greek</span>
				<span class='text'>Indeed the biological father of [[Leo VI the Wise]] (Basil II's great-grandfather) was possibly not Basil I, but [[Michael III]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gregory, p</span>
				<span class='text'>225&lt;/ref&gt; The family of Michael III were Anatolians from Phrygia and of Greek speech and culture, though originally of the [[Melchisedechians|Melchisedechian]] heretical faith</span>
				<span class='text'>In 960, Basil was associated on the throne by his father, who then died in 963, when Basil was only five years old</span>
				<span class='text'>Because he and his brother, the future Emperor [[Constantine&amp;nbsp;VIII]] (ruled 1025–1028), were too young to reign in their own right, Basil's mother [[Theophano (Byzantine Empress)|Theophano]] married one of Romanos' leading generals, who took the throne as the Emperor [[Nicephorus II|Nikephoros&amp;nbsp;II]] Phokas several months later in 963</span>
				<span class='text'>Nikephoros was murdered in 969 by his nephew [[John&amp;nbsp;I Tzimisces]], who then became emperor and reigned for seven years</span>
				<span class='text'>When Tzimisces died on 10 January 976, Basil&amp;nbsp;II finally took the throne as senior emperor</span>
				<span class='text'>=Rebellions in Anatolia and alliance with Rus'==[[File:Coronation of Basil II as co-emperor by Patriarch Polyeuctus</span>
				<span class='text'>ng|thumb|220px|Coronation of Basil as co-emperor, from the ''[[Madrid Skylitzes]]'']]Basil was a brave soldier and a superb horseman, and he would prove himself as an able general and strong ruler</span>
				<span class='text'>In the early years of his reign, administration remained in the hands of the [[eunuch]] [[Basil Lekapenos]] (an illegitimate son of Emperor [[Romanos&amp;nbsp;I]]), President of the Senate, a wily and gifted politician who hoped that the young emperors would be his puppets</span>
				<span class='text'>Basil waited and watched without interfering, devoting himself to learning the details of administrative business and military science</span>
				<span class='text'>ven though Nikephoros&amp;nbsp;II Phokas and John&amp;nbsp;I Tzimiskes were brilliant military commanders, both had proven to be lax administrators</span>
				<span class='text'>Towards the end of his reign Tzimiskes had belatedly planned to curb the power of the great landowners, and his death, coming soon after his speaking out against them, led to rumours that he had been poisoned by Basil Lekapenos, who had acquired vast estates illegally and feared an investigation and punishment</span>
				<span class='text'>s a result of the failures of his immediate predecessors, Basil&amp;nbsp;II found himself with a serious problem at the outset of his reign as two members of the wealthy military elite of [[Anatolia]], [[Bardas Skleros]] and [[Bardas Phokas the Younger|Bardas Phokas]], had sufficient means to undertake open rebellion against his authority</span>
				<span class='text'>The chief motive of these men, both of whom were experienced generals, was to assume the Imperial position that Nikephoros&amp;nbsp;II and John&amp;nbsp;I had held, and thus return Basil to the role of impotent cypher</span>
				<span class='text'>Basil, showing the penchant for ruthlessness that would become his trademark, took the field himself and suppressed the rebellions of both Skleros (979) and Phokas (989) but not without the help of 12,000 [[Georgians]] of [[Tornikios]] and [[David III Kuropalates]] of [[Tao-Klarjeti]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The relationship between the two generals was interesting: Phokas was instrumental in defeating the rebellion of Skleros, but when Phokas himself later rebelled, Skleros returned from exile to support his old enemy</span>
				<span class='text'>When Phokas dropped dead and fell from his horse in battle, Skleros, who had been imprisoned by his erstwhile accomplice, assumed the leadership of the rebellion, before being forced into surrendering to Basil in 989</span>
				<span class='text'>Skleros was allowed to live, but he ended his days blind, perhaps through disease, though he may have been punished by blinding</span>
				<span class='text'>hese rebellions had a profound effect on Basil's outlook and methods of governance</span>
				<span class='text'>The historian [[Michael Psellus|Psellus]] describes the defeated Bardas Skleros giving Basil the following advice: &quot;Cut down the governors who become over-proud</span>
				<span class='text'>Let no generals on campaign have too many resources</span>
				<span class='text'>Exhaust them with unjust exactions, to keep them busied with their own affairs</span>
				<span class='text'>Admit no woman to the imperial councils</span>
				<span class='text'>Be accessible to no one</span>
				<span class='text'>Share with few your most intimate plans</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Psellus, p</span>
				<span class='text'>43&lt;/ref&gt; Basil, it would appear, took this advice to heart</span>
				<span class='text'>n order to defeat these dangerous revolts, Basil formed an alliance with Prince [[Vladimir&amp;nbsp;I of Kiev]], who in 988 had captured [[Chersonesos Taurica|Chersonesos]], the main Imperial base in the [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Vladimir offered to evacuate Chersonesos and to supply 6,000 of his soldiers as reinforcements to Basil</span>
				<span class='text'>In exchange he demanded to be married to Basil's younger sister [[Anna Porphyrogenita|Anna]] (963–1011)</span>
				<span class='text'>At first, Basil hesitated</span>
				<span class='text'>The Byzantines viewed all the nations of Northern Europe, be they [[Franks]] or [[Slavs]], as [[barbarian]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>Anna herself objected to marrying a barbarian ruler, as such a marriage would have no precedence in imperial annals</span>
				<span class='text'>ladimir had conducted long-running research into different religions, including sending delegates to various countries</span>
				<span class='text'>Marriage was not his primary reason for choosing the Orthodox religion</span>
				<span class='text'>When Vladimir promised to baptize himself and to convert his people to Christianity, Basil finally agreed</span>
				<span class='text'>Vladimir and Anna were married in the Crimea in 989</span>
				<span class='text'>The Rus' recruitments were instrumental in ending the rebellion, and they were later organized into the [[Varangian Guard]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This marriage had important long-term implications, marking the beginning of the process by which the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] many centuries later would proclaim itself &quot;The [[Third Rome]]&quot; and claim the political and cultural heritage of the Byzantine Empire</span>
				<span class='text'>he fall of Basil Lekapenos followed the rebellions</span>
				<span class='text'>He was accused of plotting with the rebels and punished with exile and the confiscation of his enormous property</span>
				<span class='text'>Seeking to protect the lower and middle classes, Basil&amp;nbsp;II made ruthless war upon the system of immense estates in Asia Minor, which his predecessor, Romanos I, had endeavored to check</span>

				<span class='text'>[[Nomisma histamenon]]</span>
				<span class='text'>]The internal strife quelled, Basil&amp;nbsp;II turned his attention to other enemies of the Empire</span>
				<span class='text'>The Byzantine civil wars had weakened the Empire's position in the east, and the gains of Nikephoros&amp;nbsp;II Phokas and John&amp;nbsp;I Tzimiskes had nearly been lost to the [[Fatimids]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 987/988, a seven-year truce was signed with the Fatimids, stipulating an exchange of prisoners, the recognition of the Byzantine emperor as protector of the Christians under Fatimid rule and of the Fatimid Caliph as protector of the Muslims under Byzantine control, and the replacement of the name of the Abbasid Caliph by that of the Fatimid Caliph in the [[Friday prayer]] in the mosque of [[Constantinople]]</span>

				<span class='text'>202&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson (1926), p</span>
				<span class='text'>251&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in 991 the Fatimids launched a campaign against the [[Hamdanid]] [[Emirate of Aleppo]], a Byzantine protectorate, perhaps in the belief that Byzantium would not interfere</span>
				<span class='text'>Under the governor of [[Damascus]], [[Manjutakin]], the Fatimids scored a series of successes against the Hamdanids and their Byzantine allies, including a major victory at the [[Battle of the Orontes]] against the ''[[dux|doux]]'' of [[Antioch]], [[Michael Bourtzes]], in September 994</span>
				<span class='text'>The latter forced Basil to intervene personally in the East: in a lightning campaign he rode with his army through [[Asia Minor]] in sixteen days and reached Aleppo in April 995, forcing the Fatimid army to retreat without giving battle</span>
				<span class='text'>The Byzantines besieged [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripolis]] unsuccessfully and occupied [[Tartus]], which they refortified and garrisoned with Armenian troops</span>
				<span class='text'>The Fatimid caliph [[al-Aziz]] now prepared to take the field in person against the Byzantines and initiated large-scale preparations, but they were cut short upon his death</span>

				<span class='text'>251–252&lt;/ref&gt;Warfare between the two powers continued as the Byzantines supported an [[Revolt of Tyre (996–998)|anti-Fatimid uprising]] in [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 998, the Byzantines under the successor of Bourtzes, [[Damian Dalassenos]], launched an attack on [[Apamea, Syria|Apamea]], but the Fatimid general Jaush ibn al-Samsama defeated them in battle on 19 July 998</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Brooke|1968|p=252}} This defeat drew Basil II into launching a campaign in October 999, which would last three months in Syria</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Brooke|1968|p=252}} Basil's troops raided as far as [[Baalbek]], placing a garrison at [[Shaizar]], while burning three minor forts in the vicinity of [[Abu Qubays|Abu Qubais]], [[Masyaf|Masyath]], and 'Arqah</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Brooke|1968|p=252}} The siege of Tripolis in December failed, while [[Hims]] was not threatened</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Brooke|1968|p=252}} However, as Basil's attention was diverted to developments in [[Armenia]], he departed for [[Cilicia]] in January and dispatched another embassy to Cairo</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1000 a ten-year truce was concluded between the two states</span>

				<span class='text'>252&lt;/ref&gt; For the remainder of the reign of [[al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]] (r</span>
				<span class='text'>996–1021), relations remained peaceful, as Hakim was more interested in internal affairs</span>
				<span class='text'>Even the acknowledgement of Fatimid suzerainty by [[Abu Muhammad Lu'lu' al-Kabir|Lu'lu']] of Aleppo in 1004 and the Fatimid-sponsored installment of [[Fatik Aziz al-Dawla]] as the city's emir in 1017 did not lead to a resumption of hostilities, especially since Lu'lu' continued to pay tribute to Byzantium, and Fatik quickly began acting as an independent ruler</span>

				<span class='text'>205&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson (1926), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>254–255&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, Hakim's persecution of Christians in his realm, and especially the destruction of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] at his orders in 1009, strained relations and would, along with Fatimid interference in Aleppo, provide the main focus of Fatimid-Byzantine diplomatic relations until the late 1030s</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|300px|Basil&amp;nbsp;II and his step-father, Emperor Nikephoros&amp;nbsp;II]]Basil also sought to restore territories the Empire had lost long before</span>
				<span class='text'>At the start of the second millennium, he took on his greatest adversary, [[Samuel of Bulgaria]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] had been partly subjugated by John&amp;nbsp;I Tzimiskes after the [[Sviatoslav's invasion of Bulgaria|invasion]] of [[Svyatoslav&amp;nbsp;I of Kiev]], but parts of the country had remained outside Byzantine control, under the leadership of Samuel and his brothers</span>
				<span class='text'>s the Bulgars had been raiding Byzantine lands since 976, the Byzantine government sought to cause dissension amongst them by allowing the escape of their captive emperor [[Boris&amp;nbsp;II of Bulgaria]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This ploy failed, so Basil used a respite from his conflict with the nobility to lead an army of 30,000 men into Bulgaria and besiege Sredets ([[Sofia]]) in 986</span>
				<span class='text'>Taking losses and worried about the loyalty of some of his governors, Basil lifted the siege and headed back for [[Thrace]], but he fell into an ambush and suffered a serious defeat at the [[Battle of the Gates of Trajan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Basil escaped with the help of his [[Varangian Guard]] and attempted to make up his losses by turning Samuel's brother Aaron against him</span>
				<span class='text'>Aaron was tempted with Basil's offer of his sister Anna in marriage (the same Anna who wed [[Vladimir&amp;nbsp;I of Kiev]] two years later), but the negotiations failed when Aaron discovered that the bride he was sent was a fake</span>
				<span class='text'>By 987 Aaron had been eliminated by Samuel, and Basil was busy fighting both Skleros and Phokas in Asia Minor</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the titular emperor [[Roman of Bulgaria]] was captured in 991, Basil lost [[Moesia]] to the Bulgarians</span>
				<span class='text'>n 992, Basil&amp;nbsp;II concluded a treaty with [[Pietro Orseolo&amp;nbsp;II]] under terms reducing [[Venice]]'s custom duties in Constantinople from 30 ''[[nomismata]]'' to 17 ''nomismata''</span>
				<span class='text'>In return the Venetians agreed to transport Byzantine troops to southern [[Italy]] in times of war</span>

				<span class='text'>He also conducted damaging raids into Byzantine territory as far as central [[Greece]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The tide turned in 996 when the Byzantine general [[Nikephoros Ouranos]] inflicted a crushing defeat on a raiding Bulgarian army at a [[Battle of Spercheios|battle]] on the River [[Spercheios]] in Thessaly</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1000 the Byzantine generals [[Nikephoros Xiphias]] and [[Theodorokanos]] took the old Bulgarian capital of [[Preslav|Great Preslav]] and the towns of Lesser Preslav and Pliskova</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;John Skylitzes:The Year 6508&lt;/ref&gt; In 1001, Basil himself, operating from Thessalonica, was able to regain control of Vodena, Verrhoia, and Servia</span>

				<span class='text'>442&lt;/ref&gt; The following year he based his army in [[Plovdiv|Philippopolis]] and occupied the length of the military road from the western Haemus Mountains to the Danube, thereby cutting off communications between Samuel's Macedonian heartland and Moesia</span>
				<span class='text'>Following this success Basil laid siege to [[Vidin]], which eventually fell following a prolonged resistance</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Finlay, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>442–443&lt;/ref&gt; Samuel reacted to the Byzantine campaign with a daring stroke; he launched a large-scale raid into the heart of Byzantine Thrace and surprised the major city of [[Adrianople]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n returning homeward with his extensive plunder Samuel was intercepted near the town of [[Battle of Skopje|Skopje]] by a Byzantine army commanded by the emperor</span>
				<span class='text'>Basil's forces stormed the Bulgarian camp, inflicting a severe defeat on the Bulgarians and recovering the plunder of Adrianople</span>

				<span class='text'>The defection of Dyrrhachium to the Byzantines completed the isolation of Samuel's core territories in the highlands of western Macedonia</span>
				<span class='text'>Samuel was forced into an almost entirely defensive stance</span>
				<span class='text'>He extensively fortified the passes and routes from the coastlands and valleys held by the Byzantines to the territory remaining in his possession</span>
				<span class='text'>During the next few years, the Byzantine offensive slowed and no significant gains were made, though in 1009 an attempt by the Bulgarians to counterattack was defeated at the [[Battle of Kreta]], which was fought to the east of Thessalonica</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1014 Basil was ready to launch a campaign aimed at destroying Bulgarian resistance</span>
				<span class='text'>On 29 July 1014, Basil&amp;nbsp;II and his general Nikephoros Xiphias outmanoeuvred the Bulgarian army, which was defending one of the fortified passes, in the [[Battle of Kleidion]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Samuel avoided capture only through the valour of his son Gabriel</span>
				<span class='text'>Having crushed the Bulgarians, Basil exerted his vengeance by cruelty - he was said to have captured 15,000 prisoners and blinded 99 of every 100 men, leaving one one-eyed man in each cohort to lead the rest back to their ruler</span>
				<span class='text'>Samuel was physically struck down by the dreadful apparition of his blinded army and died two days later, on 6 October 1014, after suffering a stroke</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the mistreatment of the Bulgarian prisoners may have been exaggerated, this incident helped give rise to Basil's Greek epithet of ''Boulgaroktonos,'' meaning &quot;the Bulgar-slayer&quot;, in later tradition</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Finlay, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>444-445&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephenson, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>2-4&lt;/ref&gt; The first recorded coupling of the term ''Boulgaroktonos'' with Basil II dates from a number of generations after his death</span>
				<span class='text'>It appears to have entered common usage among the Byzantines at the end of the 12th century, when the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] broke away from Byzantine rule and the martial exploits of Basil against the Bulgarians became a theme of imperial propaganda</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus it was used by the historian [[Niketas Choniates]] and the writer [[Nicholas Mesarites]], and consciously inverted by the Bulgarian ruler [[Kaloyan]], who called himself &quot;Roman-slayer&quot; (''Rhomaioktonos'')</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Stephenson, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>89–96&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this, during Basil's own lifetime as well as in the works of the 11th and early 12th centuries, Basil was usually distinguished from [[Basil I the Macedonian]] by the sobriquets &quot;the Younger&quot; (''ho neos'') or &quot;the Purple-born&quot; (''ho [[porphyrogennetos]]'')</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Stephenson, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>66–80&lt;/ref&gt;Bulgaria fought on for four more years, its resistance fired by Basil's cruelty, but it finally submitted in 1018</span>
				<span class='text'>This submission was the result of continued military pressure and a successful diplomatic campaign aimed at dividing and suborning the Bulgarian leadership</span>
				<span class='text'>This victory over the Bulgarians, and the later submission of the [[Serbs]], fulfilled one of Basil's goals, as the Empire regained its ancient [[Danube River|Danubian]] frontier for the first time in 400 years</span>
				<span class='text'>he neighbouring rulers of Croatia, [[Krešimir III of Croatia|Krešimir III]] and [[Gojslav of Croatia|Gojslav]], who were previously allies of Bulgaria, accepted Basil's supremacy in order to avoid the same fate as Bulgaria; the emperor warmly received their offers of vassalage and awarded them the honorary title of [[patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[Madrid Skylitzes]], [[John Skylitzes]]&lt;/ref&gt; Croatia remained a tributary state to Basil until his death in 1025</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Fine, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>277-278&lt;/ref&gt; Before returning to Constantinople, Basil&amp;nbsp;II celebrated his triumph in [[Athens]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He showed considerable statesmanship in his treatment of the defeated Bulgarians, giving many former Bulgarian leaders court titles, positions in provincial administration, and high commands in the army</span>
				<span class='text'>In this way he sought to absorb the Bulgarian elite into Byzantine society</span>
				<span class='text'>Bulgaria did not have a monetary economy to the same extent as was found in Byzantium, and Basil made the wise decision to accept Bulgarian taxes in kind</span>
				<span class='text'>Basil's successors reversed this policy, a decision that led to considerable Bulgarian discontent, and rebellion, later in the 11th century</span>

				<span class='text'>]Although the power of the [[Khazar]] [[Khaganate]] had been broken by the [[Kievan Rus']] in the 960s, the Byzantines had not been able to fully exploit the [[power vacuum]] and restore their dominion over the [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]] and other areas around the [[Black Sea]]</span>

				<span class='text'>He later secured the annexation of the sub-kingdoms of [[Bagratuni Kingdom of Armenia|Armenia]] along with a promise that its capital and surrounding regions would be willed to Byzantium following the death of its king [[Hovhannes I of Ani|Hovhannes-Smbat]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Basil created in those highlands a strongly fortified frontier, which, if his successors had been capable, should have proved an effective barrier against the invasions of the [[Seljuk Turks]]</span>

				<span class='text'>vg|thumb|300px|The Byzantine Empire at the death of Basil&amp;nbsp;II in 1025]]Basil was a stocky man of less than average stature who, nevertheless, cut a majestic figure on horseback</span>
				<span class='text'>He had light blue eyes and strongly arched eyebrows; in later life his beard became scant but his sidewhiskers were luxuriant and he had a habit of rolling his whiskers between his fingers when deep in thought or angry</span>
				<span class='text'>He was not a fluent speaker and had a loud laugh that convulsed his whole frame</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Psellus, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>48–49&lt;/ref&gt; As a mature man he had ascetic tastes and cared little for the pomp and ceremony of the Imperial court, typically holding court dressed in military regalia</span>
				<span class='text'>Still, he was a capable administrator, who, uniquely among the soldier-emperors, left a full treasury upon his death</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Psellus, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>45–46&lt;/ref&gt; Basil despised literary culture and affected an utter scorn for the learned classes of Byzantium; however, numerous orators and philosophers were active during his reign</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Psellus, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>43–44&lt;/ref&gt;He was worshipped by his army, as he spent most of his reign campaigning with them instead of sending orders from the distant palaces of Constantinople, as had most of his predecessors</span>
				<span class='text'>He lived the life of a soldier to the point of eating the same daily rations as any other member of the army</span>
				<span class='text'>He also took the children of deceased officers of his army under his protection and offered them shelter, food, and education</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of them later became his soldiers and officers and came to think of him as a father</span>
				<span class='text'>esides being called the &quot;Father of the Army&quot;, he was also popular with country farmers</span>
				<span class='text'>This class produced most of his army's supplies and soldiers</span>
				<span class='text'>To assure that this continued, Basil's laws protected small agrarian property owners and lowered their taxes</span>
				<span class='text'>His reign was considered an era of relative prosperity for the class, despite the almost constant wars</span>
				<span class='text'>On the other hand, Basil increased the taxes on the nobility and the church, seeking to decrease their power and wealth</span>
				<span class='text'>Though understandably unpopular with them, neither had the power to effectively oppose the army-supported Emperor</span>
				<span class='text'>asil never married or had children</span>
				<span class='text'>As a young man he was a womanizer, but when he became emperor, he chose to devote himself to the duties of state</span>
				<span class='text'>Psellus ascribes Basil's radical change from a dissolute youth to a grim autocrat to the circumstances of the rebellions of Bardas Skleros and Bardas Phokas</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Psellus, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>29–30&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, Basil's asceticism meant that he was succeeded by his brother and his family, who proved to be ineffective rulers</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, fifty years of prosperity and intellectual growth followed because the funds of state were full, the borders were not in danger from exterior intruders, and the Empire remained the most powerful political entity of the age</span>
				<span class='text'>The Byzantine Empire under Basil&amp;nbsp;II probably had a population of about 18&amp;nbsp;million people</span>
				<span class='text'>By 1025, Basil&amp;nbsp;II (with an annual revenue of 7,000,000 ''nomismata'') was able to amass 14,400,000 ''nomismata'' (or 200,000 pounds of gold) for the Imperial treasury due to his prudent management</span>
				<span class='text'>=In literature==During the 20th century in [[Greece]], interest in the prominent emperor led to a number of biographies and historical novels about him</span>
				<span class='text'>Arguably the most popular is ''Basil Bulgaroktonus'' (1964) by historical fiction writer [[Kostas Kyriazis]] (born 1920)</span>
				<span class='text'>Written as a sequel to his previous work ''Theophano'' (1963), focusing on Basil's mother, it examines Basil's life from childhood till his death at an advanced age, through the eyes of three fictional narrators</span>
				<span class='text'>It has been continuously reprinted since 1964</span>

				<span class='text'>[Ion Dragoumis]], who was Delta's lover and was deeply involved in that struggle, in 1907 published the book ''Martyron kai Iroon Aima'' (Martyrs’ and Heroes’ Blood), which was full of resentment towards everything Bulgarian</span>

				<span class='text'>On one hand these people would not suffer as eyeless survivors, on the other the sheer number of Bulgarians would have diminished by 15 000, which is something very useful</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Later in the same book, Dragoumis foresaw the appearance of &quot;new Basils&quot; who would &quot;cross the entire country and will look for Bulgarians in mountains, caves, villages and forests and will make them flee in refuge or kill them&quot;</span>
