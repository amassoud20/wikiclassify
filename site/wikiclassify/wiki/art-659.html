				<span class='text'>The Arabic original contains a prologue not found in most other translations, and was written by an Arab monk, Michael</span>
				<span class='text'>Michael explained that he decided to write his biography in 1084 because none was available in his day</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the main Arabic text seems to have been written by an earlier author sometime between the early 9th and late 10th centuries AD</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Sahas32/&gt; Written from a hagiographical point of view and prone to exaggeration and some legendary details, it is not the best historical source for his life, but is widely reproduced and considered to contain elements of some value</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Brownp307&quot;/&gt;  [[Patriarch Eutychius of Alexandria|Eutychius]], a 10th-century [[Melkite]] patriarch mentions him as one high ranking official involved in the surrender of the city to the Muslims</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Sahas17&gt;{{Harvnb|Sahas|1972|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the region came under Arab [[Muslim]] occupation in the late 7th century AD, the court at Damascus retained its large complement of Christian civil servants, John's grandfather among them</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Brownp307&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sahas17/&gt; John's father, Sarjun (Sergius) or Ibn Mansur, went on to serve the [[Umayyad]] [[caliph]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Brownp307&quot;/&gt; According to John of Jerusalem and some later versions of his life, after his father's death John also served as an official to the caliphal court before leaving to become a monk</span>
				<span class='text'>This claim, that John actually served in a Muslim court, has been questioned since he is never mentioned in Muslim sources, which however do refer to his father Sarjun (Sergius) as a secretary in the caliphal administration</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoyland|1996|p=481}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, John's own writings never refer to any experience in a Muslim court</span>
				<span class='text'>It is believed that John became a monk at [[Mar Saba]], and that he was ordained as a priest in 735</span>

				<span class='text'>Under the instruction of Cosmas, who also taught John's orphan friend (the future St</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Cosmas of Maiuma]]), John is said to have made great advances in music, [[astronomy]] and theology, soon rivalling [[Pythagoras]] in arithmetic and [[Euclid]] in [[geometry]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Butlerp36&quot;/&gt; As a refugee from Italy, Cosmas brought with him the scholarly traditions of [[Western Christianity]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Career ==John had at least one and possibly two careers: one (less well-documented) as a civil servant for the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Caliph]] in Damascus, and the other (better-attested) as a priest and monk at the [[Mar Saba]] monastery near Jerusalem</span>
				<span class='text'>One source believes John left Damascus to become a monk around 706, when [[al-Walid I]] increased the Islamicisation of the Caliphate's administration</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Louthp9&gt;{{Harvnb|Louth|2003|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Muslim sources only mention that his father Sarjun (Sergius) left the administration around this time, and fail to name John at all</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoyland|1996|pp=481}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the next two decades, culminating in the [[Siege of Constantinople (717-718)]], the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] progressively occupied the borderlands of the Byzantine Empire</span>
				<span class='text'>An editor of John's works, Father [[Michel Le Quien|Le Quien]], has shown that John was already a monk at Mar Saba before the dispute over iconoclasm, explained below</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=catholic/&gt;In the early 8th century AD, [[Iconoclasm (Byzantine)|iconoclasm]], a movement opposed to the veneration of icons, gained acceptance in the [[Byzantine]] court</span>

				<span class='text'>Germanus]], [[List of Ecumenical Patriarchs of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]], Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] (who had forced the emperor to abdicate and himself assumed the throne in 717 immediately before the great siege) issued his first edict against the [[veneration]] of images and their exhibition in public places</span>

				<span class='text'>He not only attacked the Byzantine emperor, but adopted a simplified style that allowed the controversy to be followed by the common people, stirring rebellion among those of [[Christianity|Christian]] faith</span>

				<span class='text'>The caliph then ordered John's right hand be cut off and hung up in public view</span>
				<span class='text'>Some days afterwards, John asked for the restitution of his hand, and prayed fervently to the [[Theotokos]] before her icon: thereupon, his hand is said to have been miraculously restored</span>
