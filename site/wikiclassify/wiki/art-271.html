				<span class='text'>In 1800, following the example of the ''[[Empress of China (1783)|Empress of China]]'', the first American trading vessel to [[China]], Astor traded furs, teas, and [[sandalwood]] with [[Guangzhou|Canton]] in China, and greatly benefited from it</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>[[Embargo Act of 1807|Embargo Act]] in 1807, however, disrupted Astor's import/export business because it closed off trade with Canada</span>
				<span class='text'>With the permission of President [[Thomas Jefferson]], Astor established the [[American Fur Company]] on April 6, 1808</span>
				<span class='text'>He later formed subsidiaries: the [[Pacific Fur Company]], and the Southwest Fur Company (in which Canadians had a part), in order to control fur trading in the Great Lakes areas and [[Columbia River]] region</span>
				<span class='text'>His Columbia River trading post at [[Fort Astoria]] (established in April 1811) was the first United States community on the Pacific coast</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1816, he joined the opium-smuggling trade</span>

				<span class='text'>Astor rarely built on his land, but leased it to others for rent and their use</span>
