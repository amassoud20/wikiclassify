				<span class='text'>He may have belonged to the Greek nobility of Attica, with which the 10th-century [[Suda]] text records him as contemporaneous, prior to the period of the [[Seven Sages of Greece]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It also relates a [[folklore|folkloric]] story of his death in the [[Aegina|Aeginetan]] theatre</span>

				<span class='text'>So that no one would be unaware of them, they were posted on wooden tablets ({{lang|grc|ἄξονες}} - ''axones''), where they were preserved for almost two centuries on [[stele]]s of the shape of [[tetrahedron|three-sided pyramids]] ({{lang|grc|κύρβεις}} - ''kyrbeis'')</span>
				<span class='text'>{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} The tablets were called ''axones'', perhaps because they could be pivoted along the pyramid's axis to read any side</span>
				<span class='text'>he constitution featured several major innovations:*Instead of oral laws known to a special class, arbitrarily applied and interpreted, all laws were written, thus being made known to all literate citizens (who could appeal to the [[Areopagus]] for injustices): 'the constitution formed under Draco, when the first code of laws was drawn up'</span>

				<span class='text'>According to the preserved part of the inscription, unintentional homicides received a sentence of exile</span>
				<span class='text'>t is not clear whether Draco's law specified the punishment for intentional Homicide</span>
				<span class='text'>In 409 BC, intentional homicide was punished by death, but Draco's law begins, 'καὶ ἐὰμ μὲ ‘κ [π]ρονοί[α]ς [κ]τ[ένει τίς τινα, φεύγ]ε[ν]', which is ambiguous and difficult to translate</span>
