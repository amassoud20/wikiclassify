				<span class='text'>He was also the [[King of Poland]] and [[Grand Duke of Finland]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He is best known as a political conservative whose reign was marked by geographical expansion, repression of dissent, economic stagnation, poor administrative policies, a corrupt bureaucracy, and frequent wars that culminated in Russia's disastrous defeat in the [[Crimean War]] of 1853-56</span>
				<span class='text'> His biographer [[Nicholas V</span>
				<span class='text'>Riasanovsky]] says that Nicholas displayed determination, singleness of purpose, and an iron will, along with a powerful sense of duty and a dedication to very hard work</span>
				<span class='text'> He saw himself as a soldier – a junior officer totally consumed by spit and polish</span>
				<span class='text'> A handsome man, he was highly nervous and aggressive</span>
				<span class='text'> Trained as an engineer, he was a stickler for minute detail</span>
				<span class='text'> His reign had an ideology called &quot;Official Nationality&quot; that was proclaimed officially in 1833</span>
				<span class='text'> It was a reactionary policy based on orthodoxy in religion, autocracy in government, and Russian nationalism</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Riasanovsky, ''A History of Russia'' (4th edition 1984) pp 323-24&lt;/ref&gt;He was the younger brother of his predecessor, [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Nicholas inherited his brother's throne despite the failed [[Decembrist revolt]] against him and went on to become the most reactionary of all Russian leaders</span>
				<span class='text'>His aggressive foreign policy involved many expensive wars, having a disastrous effect on the empire's finances</span>
				<span class='text'>e was successful against Russia's neighbouring southern rivals as he seized the last territories in the [[Caucasus]] held by [[Qajar dynasty|Persia]] (comprising modern day [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]]) by successfully ending the [[Russo-Persian War (1826–28)]]</span>
				<span class='text'>By now, Russia had gained what is now [[Dagestan]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], Azerbaijan and Armenia from Persia, and had therefore at last gained the clear upper hand in the Caucasus, both geo-politically as well as territorially</span>
				<span class='text'>He ended the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–29)]] successfully as well</span>
				<span class='text'>Later on, however, he led Russia into the Crimean War (1853–56) with disastrous results</span>
				<span class='text'>Historians emphasize that his micromanagement of the armies hindered his generals, as did his misguided strategy</span>
				<span class='text'>Fuller notes that historians have frequently concluded that &quot;the reign of Nicholas I was a catastrophic failure in both domestic and foreign policy</span>

				<span class='text'> ''Strategy and Power in Russia 1600-1914'' ( 1998) p 243&lt;/ref&gt;  On the eve of his death, the [[Russian Empire]] reached its geographical zenith, spanning over 20 million square kilometers ({{convert|20|km2|sqmi|disp=output number only}} million square miles), but in desperate need of reform</span>

				<span class='text'>]Nicholas was born in [[Gatchina]] to [[Paul I of Russia|Emperor Paul I]] and [[Sophie Marie Dorothea of Württemberg|Empress Maria Feodorovna]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a younger brother of [[Alexander I of Russia]] and of [[Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>icholas was not brought up to become the Emperor of Russia; he had two elder brothers</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1825, when Alexander I died suddenly of [[typhus]], Nicholas was caught between swearing allegiance to his second-eldest brother, Constantine Pavlovich, and accepting the throne for himself</span>
				<span class='text'>he interregnum lasted until Constantine Pavlovich, who was in [[Warsaw]] at that time, confirmed his refusal</span>
				<span class='text'>Additionally, on 25 (13 [[Old Style]]) December, Nicholas issued the manifesto proclaiming his accession to the throne</span>
				<span class='text'>That manifesto retroactively named 1 December (19 November [[Old Style]]), the date of Alexander I's death, as the beginning of his reign</span>
				<span class='text'>During this confusion, a plot was hatched by some members of the military to overthrow Nicholas and to seize power</span>
				<span class='text'>This led to the [[Decembrist Revolt]] on 26 (14 [[Old Style]]) December 1825, an uprising Nicholas was successful in quickly suppressing</span>
				<span class='text'>=Emperor and principles==[[Image:Imperial Monogram Of Tsar Nicholas I Of Russia</span>
				<span class='text'>vg|thumb|100px|Imperial Monogram]]Nicholas completely lacked his brother's spiritual and intellectual breadth; he saw his role simply as that of a paternal [[tsarist autocracy|autocrat]] ruling his people by whatever means necessary</span>

				<span class='text'>409&quot;/&gt;  This was regarded by the Russian people as a bad omen for the coming reign</span>
				<span class='text'>The accession of Nicholas I was marred by a demonstration of 3,000 young Imperial Army officers and other liberal-minded citizens</span>
				<span class='text'>This demonstration was an attempt to force the government to accept a constitution and a representative form of government</span>
				<span class='text'>Nicolas ordered the army out to smash the demonstration</span>
				<span class='text'>The &quot;uprising&quot; was quickly put down and became known as the [[Decembrist Revolt]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Having experienced the trauma of the Decembrist Revolt on the very first day of his reign, Nicholas I was determined to restrain Russian society</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Third Section]] of the [[His Imperial Majesty's Own Chancellery|Imperial Chancellery]] ran a huge network of spies and informers with the help of [[Special Corps of Gendarmes|Gendarmes]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The government exercised [[Censorship in Russia|censorship]] and other forms of control over education, publishing, and all manifestations of public life</span>
				<span class='text'>sar Nicholas abolished several areas of local autonomy</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Bessarabia|Bessarabia's]] autonomy was removed in 1828, Poland's in 1830 and the Jewish [[Qahal]] was abolished in 1843</span>
				<span class='text'>As an exception to this trend, [[Finland]] was able to keep its autonomy partly due to Finnish soldiers' loyal participation in crushing the [[November Uprising]] in Poland</span>

				<span class='text'>The people were to show loyalty to the unrestricted authority of the [[tsar]], to the traditions of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], and to the [[Russian language]]</span>
				<span class='text'>These romantic and conservative principles outlined by Uvarov were also espoused by [[Vasily Zhukovsky]], one of the tutors of the Grand Duke Alexander</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  The results of these [[Slavophile]] principles led, broadly speaking, to increasing repression of all classes, excessive censorship and surveillance of independent minded intellectuals like [[Pushkin]] and [[Lermontov]] and to the persecution of non-Russian languages and non-Orthodox religions</span>

				<span class='text'>By order of the Tsar, Shevchenko was kept under strict surveillance and prevented from writing or painting</span>
				<span class='text'>rom 1839, Tsar Nicholas also used a former [[Byzantine Catholic]] priest named [[Joseph Semashko]] as his agent to force Orthodoxy upon the [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Rite Catholic]]s of [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]], and [[Lithuania]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This caused Tsar Nicholas to be condemned by a succession of [[Roman Pontiff]]s, the [[Marquis de Custine]], [[Charles Dickens]],&lt;ref&gt;Charles Dickens, ''THE TRUE STORY OF THE NUNS OF MINSK'', ''[[Household Words]]'', Issue No</span>

				<span class='text'>He feared the aristocracy and believed they might turn against him if he abolished serfdom</span>
				<span class='text'>However, he did make some efforts to improve the lot of the Crown Serfs (serfs owned by the government) with the help of his minister [[Pavel Kiselyov]]</span>
				<span class='text'>During most of his reign he tried to increase his control over the landowners and other influential groups in Russia</span>

				<span class='text'>One group, the [[westernizers]], believed that Russia remained backward and primitive and could progress only through more Europeanization</span>
				<span class='text'>Another group, the [[Slavophiles]], enthusiastically favored the [[Slavs]] and their culture and customs, and had a distaste for [[Western world|westerners]] and their culture and customs</span>
				<span class='text'>he Slavophiles viewed [[Slavs|Slavic]] philosophy as a source of wholeness in Russia and were sceptical of Western [[rationalism]] and materialism</span>
				<span class='text'>Some of them believed that the Russian peasant commune, or [[mir (social)|Mir]], offered an attractive alternative to Western capitalism and could make Russia a potential social and moral savior, thus representing a form of Russian [[messianism]]</span>

				<span class='text'>He wanted to neutralize the threat of foreign ideas and what he ridiculed as &quot;pseudo-knowledge</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; However, his minister of education, [[Sergei Uvarov]], quietly promoted academic freedom and autonomy, raised academic standards, improved facilities, and opened higher education to the middle classes</span>

				<span class='text'>Isaac's Square]]]]Nicholas lavished attention on his very large army; with a population of 60-70 million people, the army included a million men</span>
				<span class='text'> They had outdated equipment and tactics, but the tsar, who dressed like a soldier and surrounded himself with officers,  gloried in the victory over Napoleon in 1812 and took enormous pride in its smartness on parade</span>
				<span class='text'> The cavalry horses, for example, were only trained in parade formations, and did poorly in battle</span>
				<span class='text'>The glitter and braid masked profound weaknesses that he did not see</span>
				<span class='text'>He put generals in charge of most of his civilian agencies regardless of their qualifications</span>
				<span class='text'>An agnostic who won fame in cavalry charges was made supervisor of  Church affairs</span>
				<span class='text'>The Army became the vehicle of upward social mobility for noble youths from non-Russian areas, such as Poland, the Baltic, Finland and Georgia</span>
				<span class='text'> On the other hand, many miscreants, petty criminals and undesirables were punished by local officials by enlisting them for life in the  Army</span>
				<span class='text'> The conscription system was highly unpopular with people, as was the practice of forcing peasants to house the soldiers for six months of the year</span>
				<span class='text'>Curtiss finds that &quot;The pedantry of Nicholas' military system, which stressed unthinking obedience and parade ground evolutions rather than combat training, produced ineffective commanders in time of war</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; His commanders in the Crimean War were old and incompetent, and indeed so were his muskets as the colonels sold the best equipment and the best food</span>

				<span class='text'>At last the Crimean war at the end of his reign demonstrated to the world what no one had previously realized: Russia was militarily weak, technologically backward, and administratively incompetent</span>
				<span class='text'> Despite his grand ambitions toward the south and Turkey, Russia had not built its railroad network in that direction, and communications were bad</span>
				<span class='text'> The bureaucracy was riddled with graft, corruption and inefficiency and was unprepared for war</span>
				<span class='text'> The Navy was weak and technologically backward; the Army, although very large, was good only for parades, suffered from colonels who pocketed their men's pay, poor morale, and was even more out of touch with the latest technology as developed by Britain and France</span>
				<span class='text'>By wars' end, the Russian leadership was determined to reform the Army and the society</span>
				<span class='text'> As Fuller notes, &quot;Russia had been beaten on the Crimean peninsula, and the military feared that it would inevitably be beaten again unless steps were taken to surmount its military weakness</span>

				<span class='text'>2014 ISBN 1598849484&lt;/ref&gt;Russia fought a successful war against the Ottomans in [[Russo-Turkish War (1828-1829)|1828-29]], but it did little to increase its power in Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>Only a small Greek state became independent in the Balkans, with limited Russian influence</span>
				<span class='text'>In the Caucacus, the Russians did not fare much better</span>
				<span class='text'>It fought long, costly wars for some small territories that would not be pacified until the reign of Alexander II</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1833, Russia negotiated the [[Treaty of Unkiar-Skelessi]] with the Ottoman Empire</span>
				<span class='text'>The major European parties mistakenly believed that the treaty contained a secret clause granting Russia the right to send warships through the [[Bosporus]] and [[Dardanelles]] straits</span>
				<span class='text'>By the [[London Straits Convention]] of 1841, they affirmed Ottoman control over the straits and forbade any power, including Russia, to send warships through the straits</span>
				<span class='text'>Buoyed up by his role in suppressing the revolutions of 1848 and his mistaken belief that he had British diplomatic support, Nicholas moved against the Ottomans, who declared war on Russia on 8 October 1853</span>
				<span class='text'>On 30 November 1853, [[Russian Admiral Nakhimov]] caught the Turkish fleet in the harbor at Sinope and destroyed it</span>

				<span class='text'>133</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In 1854, fearing the results of an Ottoman defeat by Russia, Britain, [[French Second Empire|France]], the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] joined forces in the conflict known as the [[Crimean War]] to the Ottomans and Western Europeans, but often known in Russia as the ''Eastern War'', Russian: Восточная война, Vostochnaya Vojna (March 1854 – February 1856)</span>
				<span class='text'>In April 1854, Austria signed a defensive pact with Prussia</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Edward Crankshaw, ''The Shadow of the Winter Palace'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>135–136&lt;/ref&gt;Thus, Russia found herself in a war with the whole of Europe allied against her</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Edvard Radzinsky, ''Alexander II: The Last Great Tsar'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>94</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Austria offered the Ottomans diplomatic support, and [[Prussia]] remained neutral, thus leaving Russia without any allies on the continent</span>
				<span class='text'>The European allies landed in [[Crimea]] and laid siege to the well-fortified Russian base at [[Sevastopol|Sebastopol]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Russians lost battles at Alma in September 1854</span>

				<span class='text'>Bruce Lincoln, ''The Romanovs'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>425</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  This failure was followed by lost battles at Balaklava and Inkerman</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=l425/&gt; After the prolonged [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854–1855)]] the base fell, exposing Russia's inability to defend a major fortification on its own soil</span>
				<span class='text'>On the death of Nicholas I, Alexander II became Tsar</span>
				<span class='text'>On 15 January 1856, the new tsar took Russia out of the war on very unfavorable terms which included the loss of a naval fleet on the Black Sea</span>
				<span class='text'>=Death==Nicholas died on 2 March 1855, during the Crimean War</span>
				<span class='text'>He caught a chill and refused medical treatment and died of pneumonia,&lt;ref&gt;Peter Oxley, ''Russia: from Tsars to Commissars, Oxford University Press, (2001), ISBN 0-19-913418-9</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Legacy==There have been many damning verdicts on Nicholas's rule and legacy</span>

				<span class='text'>Historian Barbara Jelavich, on the other hand, points to many failures, including the &quot;catastrophic state of Russian finances,&quot; the badly equipped army, the inadequate transportation system, and a bureaucracy &quot;which was characterized by graft, corruption, and inefficiency</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1854, there were 3600 university students in Russia, 1000 fewer than in 1848</span>
				<span class='text'> Censorship was omnipresent; Historian Hugh Seton-Watson says, &quot;The intellectual atmosphere remained oppressive until the end of the reign</span>

				<span class='text'>When it was planned in 1842, he supposedly demanded the shortest path be used despite major obstacles in the way</span>
				<span class='text'>The story says he used a ruler to draw the straight line itself</span>
				<span class='text'>However the false story became popular in Russia and Britain as an explanation of how badly the country was governed</span>
				<span class='text'> By the 1870s, however, Russians were telling a different version, claiming the tsar was wise to overcome local interests that wanted the railway diverted this way and that</span>
				<span class='text'>What actually happened was that the road was laid out by engineers and he endorsed their advice to build in a straight line</span>
