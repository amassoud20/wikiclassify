				<span class='text'>His father's friend, Sir [[Henry Wotton]], was then the [[Provost (education)|provost]] of the college</span>
				<span class='text'>uring this time, his father hired a private tutor, Robert Carew, who had knowledge of Irish, to act as private tutor to his sons in Eton</span>
				<span class='text'>However, &quot;only Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Robert sometimes desires it [Irish] and is a little entered in it&quot;, but despite the &quot;many reasons&quot; given by Carew to turn their attentions to it, &quot;they practice the French and Latin but they affect not the Irish&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>From that time, Robert devoted his life to [[science|scientific]] research and soon took a prominent place in the band of enquirers, known as the &quot;[[Invisible College]]&quot;, who devoted themselves to the cultivation of the &quot;new philosophy&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>They met frequently in London, often at [[Gresham College]], and some of the members also had meetings at [[Oxford]]</span>

				<span class='text'>]Having made several visits to his Irish estates beginning in 1647, Robert moved to Ireland in 1652 but became frustrated at his inability to make progress in his chemical work</span>
				<span class='text'>In one letter, he described Ireland as &quot;a barbarous country where chemical spirits were so misunderstood and chemical instruments so unprocurable that it was hard to have any Hermetic thoughts in it</span>

				<span class='text'>Oxford University Press US, 2000</span>
				<span class='text'>ISBN 978-0-19-513427-8&lt;/ref&gt;In 1654, Boyle left Ireland for Oxford to pursue his work more successfully</span>
				<span class='text'>An inscription can be found on the wall of [[University College, Oxford]] the [[High Street, Oxford|High Street]] at [[Oxford]] (now the location of the [[Shelley Memorial]]), marking the spot where Cross Hall stood until the early 19th century</span>
				<span class='text'>It was here that Boyle rented rooms from the wealthy apothecary who owned the Hall</span>
				<span class='text'>eading in 1657 of [[Otto von Guericke]]'s air pump, he set himself with the assistance of [[Robert Hooke]] to devise improvements in its construction, and with the result, the &quot;machina Boyleana&quot; or &quot;Pneumatical Engine&quot;, finished in 1659, he began a series of experiments on the properties of air</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=acottLaw/&gt; An account of Boyle's work with the air pump was published in 1660 under the title ''New Experiments Physico-Mechanicall, Touching the Spring of the Air, and its Effects''</span>
				<span class='text'>mong the critics of the views put forward in this book was a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]], [[Francis Line]] (1595â€“1675), and it was while answering his objections that Boyle made his first mention of [[Boyle's law|the law]] that the volume of a gas varies inversely to the pressure of the gas, which among English-speaking people is usually called Boyle's Law after his name</span>
				<span class='text'>The person who originally formulated the hypothesis was [[Henry Power]] in 1661</span>
				<span class='text'>Boyle in 1662 included a reference to a paper written by Power, but mistakenly attributed it to [[Richard Towneley]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In continental Europe the hypothesis is sometimes attributed to [[Edme Mariotte]], although he did not publish it until 1676 and was likely aware of Boyle's work at the time</span>

				<span class='text'>In the leisure thus gained he wished to &quot;recruit his spirits, range his papers&quot;, and prepare some important chemical investigations which he proposed to leave &quot;as a kind of Hermetic legacy to the studious disciples of that art&quot;, but of which he did not make known the nature</span>

				<span class='text'>He was buried in the churchyard of [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]], his funeral sermon being preached by his friend Bishop [[Gilbert Burnet]]</span>

				<span class='text'>=Scientific investigator==[[File:Boyle air pump</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|Boyle's air pump]]Boyle's great merit as a scientific investigator is that he carried out the principles which [[Francis Bacon (philosopher)|Francis Bacon]] espoused in the ''[[Novum Organum]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet he would not avow himself a follower of Bacon, or indeed of any other teacher</span>
				<span class='text'>On several occasions he mentions that to keep his judgment as unprepossessed as might be with any of the modern theories of philosophy, until he was &quot;provided of experiments&quot; to help him judge of them, he refrained from any study of the [[atomism|Atomical]] and the [[RenÃ© Descartes|Cartesian]] systems, and even of the Novum Organum itself, though he admits to &quot;transiently consulting&quot; them about a few particulars</span>
				<span class='text'>Nothing was more alien to his mental temperament than the spinning of hypotheses</span>
				<span class='text'>He regarded the acquisition of knowledge as an end in itself, and in consequence he gained a wider outlook on the aims of scientific inquiry than had been enjoyed by his predecessors for many centuries</span>

				<span class='text'>â€“ [[chemistry]] was his peculiar and favourite study</span>
				<span class='text'>His first book on the subject was ''The Sceptical Chymist'', published in 1661, in which he criticised the &quot;experiments whereby vulgar [[Spagyric|Spagyrists]] are wont to endeavour to evince their Salt, [[Sulphur]] and [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] to be the true Principles of Things</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; For him chemistry was the science of the composition of substances, not merely an adjunct to the arts of the alchemist or the physician</span>
				<span class='text'>He endorsed the view of elements as the undecomposable constituents of material bodies; and made the distinction between [[mixture]]s and [[compound (chemistry)|compound]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>He made considerable progress in the technique of detecting their ingredients, a process which he designated by the term &quot;analysis&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He further supposed that the elements were ultimately composed of [[Subatomic particle|particle]]s of various sorts and sizes, into which, however, they were not to be resolved in any known way</span>
				<span class='text'>He studied the chemistry of [[combustion]] and of [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]], and conducted experiments in [[physiology]], where, however, he was hampered by the &quot;tenderness of his nature&quot; which kept him from anatomical [[dissection]]s, especially [[vivisection]]s, though he knew them to be &quot;most instructing&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>=Theological interests==In addition to philosophy, Boyle devoted much time to theology, showing a very decided leaning to the practical side and an indifference to controversial [[polemic]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>At the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of the king in 1660, he was favourably received at court and in 1665 would have received the provostship of Eton College had he agreed to take holy orders, but this he refused to do on the ground that his writings on religious subjects would have greater weight coming from a layman than a paid minister of the Church</span>
				<span class='text'>s a director of the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] he spent large sums in promoting the spread of Christianity in the East, contributing liberally to [[missionary]] societies and to the expenses of translating the Bible or portions of it into various languages</span>
				<span class='text'>Boyle supported the policy that the Bible should be available in the vernacular language of the people</span>
				<span class='text'>An [[Irish language]] version of the [[New Testament]] was published in 1602 but was rare in Boyle's adult life</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1680â€”1685 Boyle personally financed the printing of the Bible, both Old and New Testaments, in Irish</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In this respect, Boyle's attitude to the Irish language differed from the English [[Protestant Ascendancy|Ascendancy]] class in Ireland at the time, which was generally hostile to the language and largely opposed the use of Irish (not only as a language of religious worship)</span>

				<span class='text'>He was a pioneer studying races, and he believed that all human beings, (no matter how diverse their physical differences), came from the same source: [[Adam and Eve]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He studied reported stories of parents' giving birth to different coloured [[albinos]], so he concluded that Adam and Eve were originally white and that Caucasians could give birth to different coloured races</span>
				<span class='text'>Theories of [[Robert Hooke]] and [[Isaac Newton]] about color and light via optical projection (in [[physics]]), were also extended by Robert Boyle into discourses of [[polygenism|polygenesis]],&lt;ref&gt;Jen E</span>
				<span class='text'>Boyle (2010), &quot;Anamorphosis in Early Modern Literature: Mediation and Affect&quot;, Ashgate, page 74&lt;/ref&gt; speculating that maybe these differences were due to &quot;[[social influence|seminal]] impressions&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Taking this into account, it might be considered that he envisioned a good explanation for [[complexion]] at his time, due to the fact that now we know that skin color is disposed by [[genetic code|genes]], which are actually contained in the [[semen]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Boyle's writings mention that at his time, for &quot;European Eyes&quot;, beauty was not measured so much in [[colour of skin]], but in &quot;stature, comely symmetry of the parts of the body, and good features in the face&quot;</span>
