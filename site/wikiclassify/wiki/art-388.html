				<span class='text'>Margaret Sanger worked as a visiting nurse in the slums of the [[Lower East Side, Manhattan|East Side]], while her husband worked as an architect and a house painter</span>
				<span class='text'>Already imbued with her husband's leftist politics, Margaret Sanger also threw herself into the radical politics and modernist values of pre-[[World War I]] [[Greenwich Village]] bohemia</span>
				<span class='text'>She joined the Women's Committee of the New York Socialist party, took part in the labor actions of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (including the notable [[1912 Lawrence Textile Strike]] and the [[1913 Paterson Silk Strike]]) and became involved with local intellectuals, left-wing artists, socialists and social activists, including [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]], [[Upton Sinclair]], [[Mabel Dodge]] and [[Emma Goldman]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Chesler|1992}}Sanger's political interests, emerging feminism and nursing experience led her to write two series of columns on sex education entitled &quot;What Every Mother Should Know&quot; (1911–12) and &quot;What Every Girl Should Know&quot; (1912–13) for the socialist magazine ''[[New York Call]]</span>
				<span class='text'>' By the standards of the day, Sanger's articles were extremely frank in their discussion of sexuality, and many ''New York Call'' readers were outraged by them</span>

				<span class='text'>Access to contraceptive information was prohibited on grounds of obscenity by the 1873 federal [[Comstock law]] and a host of state laws</span>
				<span class='text'>Seeking to help these women, Sanger visited public libraries, but was unable to find information on contraception</span>

				<span class='text'>Afterward, &quot;Sadie&quot;  begged the attending doctor to tell her how she could prevent this from happening again, to which the doctor simply advised her to remain abstinent</span>
