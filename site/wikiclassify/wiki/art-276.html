				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Jorge Luis Borges in 1921]]Jorge Luis Borges was born into an educated middle-class family on 24 August 1899</span>
				<span class='text'>They were in comfortable circumstances but not wealthy enough to live in downtown [[Buenos Aires]]</span>
				<span class='text'>They resided in [[Palermo, Buenos Aires|Palermo]], then a poorer suburb</span>
				<span class='text'>Borges's mother, [[Leonor Acevedo Suárez]], came from a traditional Uruguayan family of [[Criollo people|criollo]] (Spanish) origin</span>
				<span class='text'>Her family had been much involved in the European settling of South America and the [[Argentine War of Independence]], and she spoke often of their heroic actions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref Name=&quot;LRB&quot;/&gt; Borges's 1929 book ''Cuaderno San Martín'' includes the poem &quot;Isidoro Acevedo&quot;, commemorating his grandfather, Isidoro de Acevedo Laprida, a soldier of the Buenos Aires Army</span>
				<span class='text'>A descendant of the Argentine lawyer and politician [[Francisco Narciso de Laprida]], Acevedo fought in the battles of [[Battle of Cepeda (1859)|Cepeda]] in 1859, [[Battle of Pavón|Pavón]] in 1861, and [[Battle of Los Corrales|Los Corrales]] in 1880</span>
				<span class='text'>Isidoro de Acevedo Laprida died of pulmonary congestion in the house where his grandson Jorge Luis Borges was born</span>
				<span class='text'>Borges grew up hearing about the faded family glory</span>
				<span class='text'>Borges's father, [[Jorge Guillermo Borges|Jorge Guillermo Borges Haslam]], was part Spanish, part Portuguese, and half English, also the son of a colonel</span>
				<span class='text'>Borges Haslam, whose mother was English, grew up speaking English at home and took his own family frequently to Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>England and English pervaded the family home</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref Name=&quot;LRB&quot;/&gt;At nine, Jorge Luis Borges translated [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Happy Prince and Other Tales#&quot;The Happy Prince&quot;|The Happy Prince]]'' into Spanish</span>
				<span class='text'>It was published in a local journal, but his friends thought the real author was his father</span>

				<span class='text'>Borges said his father &quot;tried to become a writer and failed in the attempt</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He wrote, &quot;as most of my people had been soldiers and I knew I would never be, I felt ashamed, quite early, to be a bookish kind of person and not a man of action</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref Name=&quot;LRB&quot;/&gt;Borges was taught at home until the age of 11, was bilingual in Spanish and English, reading Shakespeare in the latter at the age of twelve</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref Name=&quot;LRB&quot;/&gt; The family lived in a large house with an English library of over one thousand volumes; Borges would later remark that &quot;if I were asked to name the chief event in my life, I should say my father's library</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; His father gave up practicing law due to the failing eyesight that would eventually afflict his son</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1914, the family moved to [[Geneva]], Switzerland, and spent the next decade in Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref Name=&quot;LRB&quot;/&gt; Borges Haslam was treated by a Geneva eye specialist, while his son and daughter [[Norah Borges|Norah]] attended school, where Borges junior learned French</span>
				<span class='text'>He read [[Thomas Carlyle]] in English, and he began to read philosophy in German</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1917, when he was eighteen, he met Maurice Abramowicz and began a literary friendship that would last for the rest of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref Name=&quot;LRB&quot;/&gt; He received his [[baccalauréat]] from the [[Collège de Genève]] in 1918</span>

				<span class='text'>(He was never to finish his high school education, in fact)</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The Borges family decided that, due to political unrest in Argentina, they would remain in Switzerland during the war, staying until 1921</span>
				<span class='text'>After [[World War I]], the family spent three years living in various cities: [[Lugano]], Barcelona, [[Majorca]], Seville, and Madrid</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref Name=&quot;LRB&quot;/&gt;At that time, Borges discovered the writings of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] and [[Gustav Meyrink]]'s ''[[The Golem (Meyrink)|The Golem]]'' (1915) which became influential to his work</span>
				<span class='text'>In Spain, Borges fell in with and became a member of the [[avant-garde]], anti-[[Modernismo|Modernist]] [[Ultraism|Ultraist]] literary movement, inspired by [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] and [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], close to the [[Imagist]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>His first poem, &quot;Hymn to the Sea,&quot; written in the style of [[Walt Whitman]], was published in the magazine ''Grecia''</span>

				<span class='text'>==Early writing career===In 1921, Borges returned with his family to Buenos Aires</span>
				<span class='text'>He had little formal education, no qualifications and few friends</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref Name=&quot;LRB&quot;/&gt; He brought with him the doctrine of [[Ultraist movement|Ultraism]] and launched his career, publishing surreal poems and essays in literary journals</span>
				<span class='text'>Borges published his first published collection of poetry, ''Fervor de Buenos Aires'', in 1923 and contributed to the avant-garde review ''[[Martín Fierro (magazine)|Martín Fierro]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Borges co-founded the journals ''Prisma'', a broadsheet distributed largely by pasting copies to walls in Buenos Aires, and ''Proa''</span>
				<span class='text'>Later in life, Borges regretted some of these early publications, attempting to purchase all known copies to ensure their destruction</span>

				<span class='text'>He worked in a style that Argentine critic Ana María Barrenechea has called &quot;Irreality</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Many other Latin American writers, such as [[Juan Rulfo]], [[Juan José Arreola]], and [[Alejo Carpentier]], were also investigating these themes, influenced by the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of [[Husserl]] and [[Heidegger]] and the [[existentialism]] of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In this vein, his biographer Edwin Williamson underlines the danger in inferring an autobiographically-inspired basis for the content or tone of certain of his works: books, philosophy and imagination were as much a source of real inspiration to him as his own lived experience, if not more so</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref Name=&quot;LRB&quot;/&gt; From the first issue, Borges was a regular contributor to ''[[Sur (magazine)|Sur]]'', founded in 1931 by [[Victoria Ocampo]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Together they wrote a number of works, some under the ''nom de plume'' [[H</span>
				<span class='text'>Bustos Domecq]], including a parody detective series and fantasy stories</span>
				<span class='text'>During these years, a family friend [[Macedonio Fernández]] became a major influence on Borges</span>
				<span class='text'>The two would preside over discussions in cafés, country retreats, or Fernandez's tiny apartment in the [[Balvanera]] district</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref Name=&quot;LRB&quot;/&gt; The book includes two types of writing: the first lies somewhere between non-fictional essays and [[short stories]], using fictional techniques to tell essentially true stories</span>
				<span class='text'>The second consists of literary forgeries, which Borges initially passed off as translations of passages from famous but seldom-read works</span>
				<span class='text'>In the following years, he served as a literary adviser for the publishing house [[Emecé Editores]] and from 1936 to 1939 wrote weekly columns for ''El Hogar''</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1938, Borges found work as first assistant at the Miguel Cané Municipal Library</span>
				<span class='text'>It was in a working class area&lt;ref&gt;Boldy (2009) p</span>
				<span class='text'>32&lt;/ref&gt; and there were so few books that cataloguing more than one hundred books per day, he was told, would leave little to do for the other staff and so look bad</span>
				<span class='text'>The task took him about an hour each day and the rest of his time he spent in the basement of the library, writing and translating</span>

				<span class='text'>This was a particular tragedy for the writer as the two were very close</span>
				<span class='text'>On Christmas Eve that year, Borges suffered a severe head injury; during treatment, he nearly died of [[septicemia]]</span>

				<span class='text'>One of his most famous works, &quot;Menard&quot; examines the nature of authorship, as well as the relationship between an author and his historical context</span>
				<span class='text'>His first collection of short stories, ''El jardín de senderos que se bifurcan'' (''[[The Garden of Forking Paths]]''), appeared in 1941, composed mostly of works previously published in ''Sur''</span>

				<span class='text'>A combination of book and maze, it can be read in many ways</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Borges and the Argentine writer [[Ernesto Sabato]]</span>
				<span class='text'>]In an interview with [[Richard Burgin (writer)|Richard Burgin]] during the late 1960s, Borges described himself as an adherent of [[classical liberalism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He further recalled that his opposition to [[Marxism]] and [[communism]] was absorbed in his childhood</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Well, I have been brought up to think that the individual should be strong and the State should be weak</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; After the overthrow via [[coup d'etat]] of President [[Juan Domingo Perón]] in 1955, Borges supported efforts to purge Argentina's Government of Peronists and dismantle the former President's welfare state</span>
				<span class='text'>He was enraged that the [[Communist Party of Argentina]] opposed these measures and sharply criticized them in lectures and in print</span>
				<span class='text'>Borges's opposition to the Party in this matter ultimately led to a permanent rift with his longtime lover, Argentine Communist [[Estela Canto]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Edwin Williamson, ''Borges: A Life'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;332–333</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In a 1956 interview given to ''El Hogar'', &quot;[Communists] are in favor of totalitarian regimes and systematically combat freedom of thought, oblivious of the fact that the principal victims of dictatorships are, precisely, intelligence and culture</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Williamson (2004), page 334</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;He elaborated, &quot;Many people are in favor of dictatorships because they allow them to avoid thinking for themselves</span>
				<span class='text'>Everything is presented to them ready-made</span>
				<span class='text'>There are even agencies of the State that supply them with opinions, passwords, slogans, and even idols to exalt or cast down according to the prevailing wind or in keeping with the directives of the thinking heads of the [[one-party state|single party]]</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Williamson (2004), pages 334-335</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In later years, Borges frequently expressed contempt for Marxists and Communists within the Latin American intelligentsia</span>
				<span class='text'>In an interview with Burgin, Borges referred to Chilean poet [[Pablo Neruda]] as &quot;a very fine poet&quot; but a &quot;very mean man&quot; for unconditionally supporting the Soviet Union and demonizing the United States</span>

				<span class='text'>Borges responded with the essay &quot;Yo, Judío&quot; (&quot;I, a Jew&quot;), a reference to the old &quot;Yo, Argentino&quot; (&quot;I, an Argentine&quot;), a defensive phrase used during [[pogrom]]s of Argentine Jews to make it clear to attackers that an intended victim was not Jewish</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref Name=&quot;Humor&quot;/&gt;Both before and during the [[Second World War]], Borges regularly published essays attacking the Nazi police state and its racist ideology</span>
				<span class='text'>His outrage was fueled by his deep love for [[German literature]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In an essay published in 1937, Borges attacked the Nazi Party's use of children's books in order to inflame antisemitism</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote, &quot;I don't know if the world can do without German civilization, but I do know that its corruption by the teachings of hatred is a crime</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jorge Luis Borges, ''Selected Nonfictions'', p 200</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In a 1938 essay, Borges reviewed an anthology which rewrote German authors of the past to fit the Nazi party line</span>
				<span class='text'>He was disgusted by what he described as Germany's &quot;chaotic descent into darkness&quot; and the attendant rewriting of history</span>
				<span class='text'>He argues that such books sacrifice culture, history and honesty in the name of defending German honour</span>
				<span class='text'>Such practices, he writes, &quot;perfect the criminal arts of barbarians</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Selected Nonfictions'', page 201</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In a 1944 essay, Borges postulated,{{quote|text=Nazism suffers from unreality, like [[Erigena]]'s hell</span>
				<span class='text'>It is uninhabitable; men can only die for it, lie for it, wound and kill for it</span>
				<span class='text'>No one, in the intimate depths of his being, can wish it to triumph</span>
				<span class='text'>I shall risk this conjecture: ''Hitler wants to be defeated''</span>
				<span class='text'>Hitler is blindly collaborating with the inevitable armies that will annihilate him, as the metal vultures and the dragon (which must have known that they were monsters) collaborated, mysteriously, with [[Hercules]]</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Borges, ''Selected Nonfictions'', page 211</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;}}In 1946, Borges published the short story &quot;[[Deutsches Requiem (short story)|Deutsches Requiem]]&quot;, which masquerades as the last testament of [[Otto Dietrich zur Linde]], a condemned Nazi [[war criminal]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In a 1967 interview with Burgin, Borges recalled how his interactions with Argentina's Nazi sympathisers led him to create the story</span>
				<span class='text'>{{quote|text=And then I realized that those people that were on the side of Germany, that they never thought of German victories or the German glory</span>
				<span class='text'>What they really liked was the idea of the [[Blitzkrieg]], of London being on fire, of the country being destroyed</span>
				<span class='text'>As to the German fighters, they took no stock in them</span>
				<span class='text'>Then I thought, well now Germany has lost, now America has saved us from this nightmare, but since nobody can doubt on which side I stood, I'll see what can be done from a literary point of view in favor of the Nazis</span>
				<span class='text'>And then I created the ideal Nazi</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|President Juan Domingo Perón at his 1946 inaugural parade</span>
				<span class='text'>]In 1946, Argentine President [[Juan Perón]] began transforming Argentina into a [[one-party state]] with the assistance of his wife [[Eva Perón|Evita]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Almost immediately, the [[spoils system]] was the rule of the day, as ideological critics of the ruling ''[[Partido Justicialista]]'' were fired from government jobs</span>
				<span class='text'>During this period, Borges was informed that he was being &quot;promoted&quot; from his position at the Miguel Cané Library to a post as inspector of poultry and rabbits at the Buenos Aires municipal market</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon demanding to know the reason, Borges was told, &quot;Well, you were on the side of the Allies, what do you expect?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Williamson (2004) p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;292&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Borges resigned from Government service the following day</span>
				<span class='text'>erón's treatment of Borges became a [[wikt:cause célèbre|cause célèbre]] for the Argentine intelligentsia</span>
				<span class='text'>The Argentine Society of Writers (SADE) held a formal dinner in his honour</span>
				<span class='text'>At the dinner, a speech was read which Borges had written for the occasion</span>
				<span class='text'>It said:{{quote|text=Dictatorships breed oppression, dictatorships breed servility, dictatorships breed cruelty; more loathsome still is the fact that they breed idiocy</span>
				<span class='text'>Bellboys babbling orders, portraits of [[caudillo]]s, prearranged cheers or insults, walls covered with names, unanimous ceremonies, mere discipline usurping the place of clear thinking</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|280px|Borges in 1976</span>
				<span class='text'>]In the aftermath, Borges found himself much in demand as a lecturer and one of the intellectual leaders of the Argentine opposition</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1951 he was asked by anti-Peronist friends to run for president of SADE</span>
				<span class='text'>Borges, then suffering from depression caused by a failed romance, reluctantly accepted</span>
				<span class='text'>He later recalled that he would awake every morning and remember that Perón was President and feel deeply depressed and ashamed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Williamson (2004) p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;312&lt;/ref&gt; Perón's government had seized control of the Argentine mass media and regarded SADE with indifference</span>
				<span class='text'>Borges later recalled, however, &quot;Many distinguished men of letters did not dare set foot inside its doors</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref Name=&quot;Williamson313&quot;&gt;Williamson (2004) p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;313&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, SADE became an increasing refuge for critics of the regime</span>
				<span class='text'>SADE official Luisa Mercedes Levinson noted, &quot;We would gather every week to tell the latest jokes about the ruling couple and even dared to sing the songs of the [[French Resistance]], as well as '[[La Marseillaise]]'</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref Name=&quot;Williamson313&quot;/&gt;After Evita's death on July 26, 1952, Borges received a visit from two policemen, who ordered him to put up two portraits of the ruling couple on the premises of SADE</span>
				<span class='text'>Borges indignantly refused, calling it a ridiculous demand</span>
				<span class='text'>The policemen icily retorted that he would soon face the consequences</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Williamson (2004) p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;320</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The Justicialist Party placed Borges under 24-hour surveillance and sent policemen to sit in on his lectures; in September they ordered SADE to be permanently closed down</span>
				<span class='text'>Like much of the Argentine opposition to Perón, SADE had become marginalized due to persecution by the State, and very few active members remained</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to Edwin Williamson,{{quote|text=Borges had agreed to stand for the presidency of the SADE in order [to] fight for intellectual freedom, but he also wanted to avenge the humiliation he believed he had suffered in 1946, when the Peronists had proposed to make him an inspector of chickens</span>
				<span class='text'>In his letter of 1950 to [[Attilio Rossi]], he claimed that his infamous promotion had been a clever way the Peronists had found of damaging him and diminishing his reputation</span>
				<span class='text'>The closure of the SADE meant that the Peronists had damaged him a second time, as was borne out by the visit of the Spanish writer [[Julián Marías]], who arrived in Buenos Aires shortly after the closure of the SADE</span>
				<span class='text'>It was impossible for Borges, as president, to hold the usual reception for the distinguished visitor; instead, one of Borges' friends brought a lamb from his ranch, and they had it roasted at a tavern across the road from the SADE building on Calle Mexico</span>
				<span class='text'>After dinner, a friendly janitor let them into the premises, and they showed Marías around by candlelight</span>
				<span class='text'>That tiny group of writers leading a foreign guest through a dark building by the light of guttering candles was vivid proof of the extent to which the SADE had been diminished under the rule of Juan Perón</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Williamson (2004) pp</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;320-321</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;}}On September 16, 1955, General [[Pedro Eugenio Aramburu]]'s ''[[Revolución Libertadora]]'' toppled the ruling party and forced Perón to flee into exile</span>
				<span class='text'>Borges was overjoyed and joined demonstrators marching through the streets of Buenos Aires</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Williamson, Borges shouted, &quot;Viva la Patria,&quot; until his voice grew hoarse</span>
				<span class='text'>Due to the influence of Borges' mother and his own role on the opposition to Peron, the provisional government appointed Borges as the Director of the [[National Library of the Argentine Republic|National Library]]</span>

				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt;In his essay ''L'Illusion Comique'', Borges wrote that there were two histories of Peronism in Argentina</span>
				<span class='text'>The first he described as &quot;the criminal one&quot;, composed of the [[police state]] tactics used against both real and imagined anti-Peronists</span>
				<span class='text'>The second history was, according to Borges, &quot;the theatrical one&quot; composed of &quot;tales and fables made for consumption by dolts</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He argued that, despite their claims to detest [[Capitalism]], Juan and Eva Perón &quot;copied its methods, dictating names and slogans to the people&quot; in the same way that multi-national corporations &quot;impose their razor blades, cigarettes, and washing machines</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jorge Luis Borges, ''Selected Nonfictions'', page 409</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Borges then listed the numerous [[conspiracy theories]] the ruling couple dictated to their followers and how those theories were accepted without question</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jorge Luis Borges, ''Selected Nonfictions'', pages 409-410</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Borges concluded:{{quote|text=It is useless to list the examples; one can only denounce the duplicity of the fictions of the former regime, which can't be believed and were believed</span>
				<span class='text'>It will be said that the public's lack of sophistication is enough to explain the contradiction; I believe that the cause is more profound</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]] spoke of the &quot;willing [[suspension of disbelief]],&quot; that is, poetic faith; [[Samuel Johnson]] said, in defense of Shakespeare, that the spectators at a tragedy do not believe they are in [[Alexandria]] in the first act and Rome in the second but submit to the pleasure of a fiction</span>
				<span class='text'>Similarly, the lies of a dictatorship are neither believed nor disbelieved; they pertain to an intermediate plane, and their purpose is to conceal or justify sordid or atrocious realities</span>
				<span class='text'>They pertain to the pathetic or the clumsily sentimental</span>
				<span class='text'>Happily, for the enlightenment and security of the Argentines, the current regime has understood that the function of government is not to inspire pathos</span>

				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;410</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;}}In a 1967 interview, Borges said, &quot;Perón was a humbug, and he knew it, and everybody knew it</span>
				<span class='text'>But Perón could be very cruel</span>
				<span class='text'>I mean, he had people tortured, killed</span>
				<span class='text'>And his wife was a common prostitute</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Burgin (1969), p&amp;nbsp;121&lt;/ref&gt;When Perón returned from exile in 1973 and regained the Presidency, Borges was enraged</span>
				<span class='text'>In a 1975 interview for ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'', he said &quot;Damn, the snobs are back in the saddle</span>
				<span class='text'>If their posters and slogans again defile the city, I'll be glad I've lost my sight</span>
				<span class='text'>Well, they can't humiliate me as they did before my books sold well</span>

				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;303</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; After being accused of being unforgiving, Borges quipped, &quot;I resented Perón's making Argentina look ridiculous to the world</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>as in 1951, when he announced control over [[thermonuclear fusion]], which still hasn't happened anywhere but in the sun and the stars</span>
				<span class='text'>For a time, Argentinians hesitated to wear band aids for fear friends would ask, 'Did the atomic bomb go off in your hand?' A shame, because Argentina really has world-class scientists</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref Name=&quot;Natgeo303&quot;/&gt;After Borges' death in 1986, the Peronist ''[[Partido Justicialista]]'' declined to send a delegate to the writer's memorial service in Buenos Aires</span>
				<span class='text'>A spokesman for the Party said that this was in reaction to &quot;certain declarations he had made about the country</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref Name=&quot;William491&quot;&gt;Williamson (2004) p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;491&lt;/ref&gt; Later, at the City Council of Buenos Aires, Peronist politicians refused to honor Borges as an Argentine, commenting that he &quot;chose to die abroad</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; When infuriated politicians from the other parties demanded to know the real reason, the Peronists finally explained that Borges had made statements about Evita Perón which they called &quot;unacceptable</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref Name=&quot;William491&quot;/&gt;===Military junta===During the 1970s, Borges at first expressed support for Argentina's [[military junta]], but was scandalized by the junta's actions during the [[Dirty War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In protest against their support of the regime, Borges ceased publishing in the newspaper ''[[La Nación]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In 1985 he wrote a short poem about the [[Falklands War]] called ''Juan López y John Ward'', about two fictional soldiers (one from each side), who died in the Falklands, in which he refers to &quot;islands that were too famous</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He also said about the war: &quot;The Falklands thing was a fight between two bald men over a comb</span>

				<span class='text'>For example, his interest in [[idealism]] runs through his work, reflected in the fictional world of Tlön in &quot;[[Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]]&quot; and in his essay &quot;[[A New Refutation of Time]]&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>==Hoaxes and forgeries===[[File:Borges Grave Cemetery Geneva</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Tomb of Jorge Luis Borges, Cimetière des Rois, Plainpalais</span>
				<span class='text'>]Borges's best-known set of literary forgeries date from his early work as a translator and literary critic with a regular column in the Argentine magazine ''El Hogar''</span>
				<span class='text'>Along with publishing numerous legitimate translations, he also published original works, for example, in the style of [[Emanuel Swedenborg]]&lt;ref group='Notes' name='d'/&gt; or '' [[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', originally claiming them to be translations of works he had chanced upon</span>
				<span class='text'> In another case, he added three short, falsely attributed pieces into his otherwise legitimate and carefully researched anthology ''El matrero''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref group='Notes' name='d'/&gt; Several of these are gathered in the ''[[A Universal History of Infamy]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>t times he wrote reviews of nonexistent writings by some other person</span>
				<span class='text'>The key example of this is &quot;[[Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote|Pierre Menard, Author of the ''Quixote'']]&quot;, which imagines a twentieth-century Frenchman who tries to write [[Miguel de Cervantes]]'s ''[[Don Quixote]]'' verbatim, not by having memorized Cervantes's work but as an &quot;original&quot; narrative of his own invention</span>
				<span class='text'>Initially the Frenchman tries to immerse himself in sixteenth-century Spain, but he dismisses the method as too easy, instead trying to reach ''Don Quixote'' through his own experiences</span>
				<span class='text'>He finally manages to (re)create &quot;the ninth and thirty-eighth chapters of the first part of ''Don Quixote'' and a fragment of chapter twenty-two</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Borges's &quot;review&quot; of the work of the fictional Menard uses tongue-in-cheek comparisons to explore the resonances that ''Don Quixote'' has picked up over the centuries since it was written</span>
				<span class='text'>He discusses how much &quot;richer&quot; Menard's work is than that of Cervantes's, even though the actual text is exactly the same</span>
				<span class='text'>hile Borges was the great popularizer of the review of an imaginary work, he had developed the idea from [[Thomas Carlyle]]'s ''[[Sartor Resartus]]'', a book-length review of a non-existent German [[transcendentalism|transcendentalist]] work, and the biography of its equally non-existent author</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''This Craft of Verse'',  Borges says that in 1916 in Geneva &quot;[I] discovered, and was overwhelmed by, Thomas Carlyle</span>
				<span class='text'>I read ''[[Sartor Resartus]]'', and I can recall many of its pages; I know them by heart</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Borges ''This Craft of Verse'' (p104)&lt;/ref&gt; In the introduction to his first published volume of fiction, ''The Garden of Forking Paths'', Borges remarks, &quot;It is a laborious madness and an impoverishing one, the madness of composing vast books, setting out in five hundred pages an idea that can be perfectly related orally in five minutes</span>
				<span class='text'>The better way to go about it is to pretend that those books already exist, and offer a summary, a commentary on them</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He then cites both ''Sartor Resartus'' and [[Samuel &quot;Erewhon&quot; Butler|Samuel Butler]]'s ''The Fair Haven'', remarking, however, that &quot;those works suffer under the imperfection that they themselves are books, and not a whit less tautological than the others</span>

				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|Jorge Luis Borges Monument in [[Santiago de Chile]]]]Borges's change in style from regionalist ''[[criollismo]]'' to a more cosmopolitan style brought him much criticism from journals such as ''[[Contorno]]'', a leftist, Sartre-influenced Argentine publication founded by [[David Viñas]] and his brother, along with other intellectuals such as [[Noé Jitrik]] and Adolfo Prieto</span>
				<span class='text'>In the post-Peronist Argentina of the early 1960s, ''Contorno'' met with wide approval from the youth who challenged the authenticity of older writers such as Borges and questioned their legacy of experimentation</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Magic realism]] and exploration of universal truths, they argued, had come at the cost of responsibility and seriousness in the face of society’s problems</span>

				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;56–57&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Contorno'' writers acknowledged Borges and [[Eduardo Mallea]] for being &quot;doctors of technique&quot; but argued that their work lacked substance due to their lack of interaction with the reality that they inhabited, an [[existentialist]] critique of their refusal to embrace existence and reality in their artwork</span>

				<span class='text'>The second fact is the more significant</span>
				<span class='text'>In each of these texts we find Kafka's idiosyncrasy to a greater or lesser degree, but if Kafka had never written a line, we would not perceive this quality; in other words, it would not exist</span>
				<span class='text'>The poem [[s:Fears and Scruples|&quot;Fears and Scruples&quot;]] by [[Robert Browning|Browning]] foretells Kafka's work, but our reading of Kafka perceptibly sharpens and deflects our reading of the poem</span>

				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|270px|left|Borges in 1976]]Along with other young Argentine writers of his generation, Borges initially rallied around the fictional character of Martín Fierro</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[Martín Fierro]]'', a poem by [[José Hernández (writer)|José Hernández]], was a dominant work of 19th century [[Argentine literature]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Its eponymous hero became a symbol of Argentine sensibility, untied from European values – a [[gaucho]], free, poor, ''[[pampas]]''-dwelling</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref Name=&quot;Irreverence&quot;/&gt; The character Fierro is illegally drafted to serve at a border fort to defend it against the indigenous population but ultimately deserts to become a ''gaucho matrero'', the Argentine equivalent of a North American western outlaw</span>
				<span class='text'>Borges contributed keenly to the avant garde ''[[Martín Fierro (magazine)|Martín Fierro magazine]]'' in the early 1920s</span>
				<span class='text'>s Borges matured, he came to a more nuanced attitude toward the Hernández poem</span>
				<span class='text'>In his book of essays on the poem, Borges separates his admiration for the aesthetic virtues of the work from his mixed opinion of the moral virtues of its protagonist</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Borges and Guerrero  (1953) ''El &quot;Martín Fierro'' ISBN 84-206-1933-7&lt;/ref&gt; In his essay &quot;The Argentine Writer and Tradition&quot; (1951), Borges celebrates how Hernández expresses the Argentine character</span>
				<span class='text'>In a key scene in the poem, Martín Fierro and El Moreno compete by improvising songs on universal themes such as time, night, and the sea, reflecting the real-world gaucho tradition of ''payadas'', improvised musical dialogues on philosophical themes</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref Name=&quot;Irreverence&quot;&gt;Gabriel Waisman, Sergio (2005) ''Borges and Translation: The Irreverence of the Periphery'' Bucknell University Press pp</span>

				<span class='text'>n his works he refutes the arch-nationalist interpreters of the poem and disdains others, such as critic Eleuterio Tiscornia, for their Europeanising approach</span>
				<span class='text'>Borges denies that Argentine literature should distinguish itself by limiting itself to &quot;local colour&quot;, which he equates with cultural nationalism</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref Name=&quot;Argentine&quot;/&gt; [[Jean Racine|Racine]] and [[Shakespeare]]'s work, he says, looked beyond their countries' borders</span>
				<span class='text'>Neither, he argues, need the literature be bound to the heritage of old world Spanish or European tradition</span>
				<span class='text'>Nor should it define itself by the conscious rejection of its colonial past</span>
				<span class='text'>He asserts that Argentine writers need to be free to define Argentine literature anew, writing about Argentina and the world from the point of view of those who have inherited the whole of world literature</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref Name=&quot;Argentine&quot;/&gt; Williamson says &quot;Borges's main argument is that the very fact of writing from the margins provides Argentine writers with a special opportunity to innovate without being bound to the canons of the centre, [</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> at once a part of and apart from the centre, which gives them much potential freedom&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref Name=&quot;Irreverence&quot;/&gt;===Argentine culture===Borges focused on universal themes, but also composed a substantial body of literature on themes from Argentine folklore and history</span>
				<span class='text'>His first book, the poetry collection ''Fervor de Buenos Aires'' (''Passion for Buenos Aires''), appeared in 1923</span>
				<span class='text'>Borges's writings on things Argentine, include Argentine culture (&quot;History of the Tango&quot;; &quot;Inscriptions on Horse Wagons&quot;), folklore (&quot;Juan Muraña&quot;, &quot;Night of the Gifts&quot;), literature (&quot;The Argentine Writer and Tradition&quot;, &quot;Almafuerte&quot;; &quot;[[Evaristo Carriego]]&quot;), and national concerns (&quot;Celebration of the Monster&quot;, &quot;Hurry, Hurry&quot;, &quot;The Mountebank&quot;, &quot;Pedro Salvadores&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>Ultranationalists, however, continued to question his Argentine identity</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref Name=&quot;Butterflies&quot;/&gt;Borges's interest in Argentine themes reflects, in part, the inspiration of his family tree</span>
				<span class='text'>Borges had an English paternal grandmother who, around 1870, married the ''criollo'' Francisco Borges, a man with a military command and a historic role in the [[Argentine Civil Wars]] in what is now Argentina and [[Uruguay]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Spurred by pride in his family's heritage, Borges often used those civil wars as settings in fiction and quasi-fiction (for example, &quot;The Life of Tadeo Isidoro Cruz,&quot; &quot;The Dead Man,&quot; &quot;Avelino Arredondo&quot;) as well as poetry (&quot;General Quiroga Rides to His Death in a Carriage&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>Borges's maternal great-grandfather, [[Manuel Isidoro Suárez]], was another military hero, whom Borges immortalized in the poem &quot;A Page to Commemorate Colonel Suárez, Victor at Junín</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The city of [[Coronel Suárez]] in the south of [[Buenos Aires Province]] is named after him</span>
				<span class='text'>is non-fiction explores many of the themes found in his fiction</span>
				<span class='text'>Essays such as &quot;The History of the [[Tango (dance)|Tango]]&quot; or his writings on the epic poem &quot;[[Martín Fierro]]&quot; explore Argentine themes, such as the identity of the Argentine people and of various Argentine subcultures</span>
				<span class='text'>The varying genealogies of characters, settings, and themes in his stories, such as &quot;La muerte y la brújula&quot;, used Argentine models without pandering to his readers or framing Argentine culture as &quot;exotic&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref Name=&quot;Butterflies&quot;/&gt; In fact, contrary to what is usually supposed, the geographies found in his fictions often do not correspond to those of real-world Argentina</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;David Boruchoff (1985), “In Pursuit of the Detective Genre: ‘La muerte y la brújula’ of Jorge Luis Borges,” ''Inti: Revista de Literatura Hispánica'' no</span>
				<span class='text'>21, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>13-26</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In his essay &quot;El escritor argentino y la tradición&quot;, Borges notes that the very absence of camels in the [[Qur'an]] was proof enough that it was an [[Arabian]] work</span>
				<span class='text'>He suggested that only someone trying to write an &quot;Arab&quot; work would purposefully include a camel</span>

				<span class='text'>ISBN 3-03911-193-0&lt;/ref&gt; He uses this example to illustrate how his dialogue with universal existential concerns was just as Argentine as writing about gauchos and tangos</span>
				<span class='text'>==Multicultural influences===At the time of the [[Argentine Declaration of Independence]] in 1816, the population was predominantly ''[[Criollo people|criollo]]'' (of Spanish ancestry)</span>
