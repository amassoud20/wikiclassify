				<span class='text'>She was particularly noted for her energetic, often off-beat roles in the [[screwball comedy|screwball comedies]] of the 1930s</span>
				<span class='text'>She was the highest-paid star in Hollywood in the late 1930s</span>
				<span class='text'>ombard was born into a wealthy family in [[Fort Wayne]], [[Indiana]], but was raised in Los Angeles by her single mother</span>
				<span class='text'>At 12, she was recruited by the film director [[Allan Dwan]] and made her screen debut in ''A Perfect Crime'' (1921)</span>
				<span class='text'>Eager to become an actress, she signed a contract with the [[Fox Film Corporation]] at age 16, but mainly played [[bit part]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>She was dropped by Fox after a car accident left a scar on her face</span>
				<span class='text'>Lombard appeared in 15 short comedies for [[Mack Sennett]] between 1927 and 1929, and then began appearing in feature films such as ''[[High Voltage (1929 film)|High Voltage]]'' and  ''[[The Racketeer]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>After a successful appearance in ''[[The Arizona Kid (1930 film)|The Arizona Kid]]'' (1930), she was signed to a contract with [[Paramount Pictures]]</span>
				<span class='text'>aramount quickly began casting Lombard as a leading lady, primarily in drama films</span>
				<span class='text'>Her fame increased when she married [[William Powell]] in 1931, but the pair divorced two years later</span>
				<span class='text'>A turning point in Lombard's career came in 1934, when she starred in [[Howard Hawks]]' pioneering screwball comedy ''[[Twentieth Century (film)|Twentieth Century]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The actress found her niche in this genre, and continued to appear in films such as ''[[Hands Across the Table]]'' (1935) - forming a popular partnership with [[Fred MacMurray]], ''[[My Man Godfrey]]'' (1936), for which she was Oscar nominated, and ''[[Nothing Sacred (film)|Nothing Sacred]]'' (1937)</span>
				<span class='text'>During this period, Lombard married &quot;the King of Hollywood&quot; [[Clark Gable]], and the pair was treated in the media as a celebrity [[supercouple]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Keen to win an Oscar, at the end of the decade, Lombard began to move towards more serious roles</span>
				<span class='text'>Unsuccessful in this aim, she returned to comedy in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>&amp; Mrs</span>
				<span class='text'>Smith (1941 film)|Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>&amp; Mrs</span>

				<span class='text'>=Early years=====Childhood===Lombard was born in [[Fort Wayne]], [[Indiana]], on October 6, 1908</span>
				<span class='text'>Christened with the name Jane Alice Peters, she was the third child and only daughter of Frederick Christian Peters (1875–1935) and Elizabeth Jayne &quot;Bessie&quot; (Knight) Peters (1876–1942)</span>
				<span class='text'>Her two older brothers, to each of whom she was close, both growing up and in adulthood, were Frederick Charles (1902-1979) and John Stuart (1906-1956)</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Gehring 2003|p=19}} Lombard's parents both descended from wealthy families and her early years were lived in comfort, with the biographer Robert Matzen calling it her &quot;[[silver spoon]] period&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnm|1a1=Matzen 1988|1p=1|2a1=Gehring 2003|2p=19}} The marriage between her parents was strained, however,{{sfn|Gehring 2003|p=23}} and in October 1914, her mother took the children and moved to Los Angeles</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Ott 1972|p=16}} Although the couple did not divorce, the separation was permanent</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Gehring 2003|p=23}} Her father's continued financial support allowed the family to live without worry, if not with the same affluence they had enjoyed in Indiana, and they settled into an apartment near [[Venice Boulevard]] in Los Angeles</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Gehring 2003|p=25}}[[File:A perfect crime 1921</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|upright|At age 12, Lombard had a small role in the film ''A Perfect Crime'' (1921)</span>
				<span class='text'>]Described by her biographer Wes Gehring as &quot;a free-spirited [[tomboy]]&quot;, the young Lombard was passionately involved in sports and enjoyed watching movies</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Gehring 2003|p=20}} At [[Virgil Middle School|Virgil Junior High School]], she participated in tennis, volleyball, and swimming, and won trophies for her achievements in athletics</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Ott 1972|p=16}} At the age of 12, this hobby unexpectedly landed Lombard her first screen role</span>
				<span class='text'>While playing baseball with friends, she caught the attention of the film director [[Allan Dwan]], who later recalled seeing &quot;a cute-looking little tomboy&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>out there knocking the hell out of the other kids, playing better baseball than they were</span>
				<span class='text'>And I needed someone of her type for this picture</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Gehring 2003|pp=27–28}} With the encouragement of her mother, Lombard happily took a small role in the melodrama ''A Perfect Crime'' (1921)</span>
				<span class='text'>She was on set for two days,{{sfn|Gehring 2003|pp=27–28}} playing the sister of [[Monte Blue]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Ott 1972|p=17}} Dwan later commented, &quot;She ate it up&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Matzen 1988|p=5}}===Aspiring actress, Fox (1921–26)===''A Perfect Crime'' was not widely distributed, but the brief experience spurred Lombard and her mother to look for more film work</span>
				<span class='text'>The teenager attended several auditions, but none was successful</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Gehring 2003|p=29}} While appearing as the queen of [[Fairfax High School (Los Angeles)|Fairfax High School]]'s [[May Day]] Carnival at the age of 15, she was scouted by an employee of [[Charlie Chaplin]] and offered a screen test to appear in his film ''[[The Gold Rush]]'' (1925)</span>
				<span class='text'>Lombard was not given the role, but it raised Hollywood's awareness of the aspiring actress</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Gehring 2003|pp=39–41}} Her test was seen by the [[Vitagraph Film Company]], which expressed an interest in signing her to a contract</span>
				<span class='text'>Although this did not materialize, the condition that she adopt a new first name (&quot;Jane&quot; was considered too dull) lasted with Lombard throughout her career</span>
				<span class='text'>She selected the name &quot;Carol&quot; after a girl with whom she played tennis in middle school</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Matzen 1988|p=6}}In October 1924, shortly after these disappointments, 16-year-old Lombard was signed to a contract with the [[Fox Film Corporation]]</span>
				<span class='text'>How this came about is uncertain: in her lifetime, it was reported that a director for the studio scouted her at a dinner party, but more recent evidence suggests that Lombard's mother contacted [[Louella Parsons]], the gossip columnist, who then got her a screen test</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Gehring 2003|pp=44–45}} According to the biographer Larry Swindell, Lombard's beauty convinced [[Winfield Sheehan]], head of the studio, to sign her to a $75-per-week contract</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Swindell 1975|p=40}} The teenager abandoned her schooling to embark on this new career</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Matzen 1988|p=6}} Fox was happy to use the name Carol, but unlike Vitagraph, disliked her surname</span>
				<span class='text'>From this point, she became &quot;Carol Lombard&quot;, the new name taken from a family friend</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Gehring 2003|p=46}}The majority of Lombard's appearances with Fox were [[bit part]]s{{sfn|Matzen 1988|p=6}} in low-budget [[Western (genre)|Westerns]] and adventure films</span>
				<span class='text'>She later commented on her dissatisfaction with these roles: &quot;All I had to do was simper prettily at the hero and scream with terror when he battled with the villain</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Gehring 2003|p=46}} She fully enjoyed the other aspects of film work, however, such as photo shoots, costume fittings, and socializing with actors on the studio set</span>
				<span class='text'>Lombard embraced the [[flapper]] lifestyle and became a regular at the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Coconut Grove]] nightclub, where she won several [[Charleston (dance)|Charleston]] dance competitions</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnm|1a1=Matzen 1988|1p=6|2a1=Gehring 2003|2p=47}}In March 1925, Fox gave Lombard a leading role in the drama ''[[Marriage in Transit]]'', opposite [[Edmund Lowe]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Her performance was well-received, with a reviewer for ''[[Motion Picture News]]'' writing that she displayed, &quot;good poise and considerable charm</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Ott 1972|pp=18; 49}} Despite this, the studio heads were unconvinced that Lombard was leading lady material, and her one-year contract was not renewed</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnm|1a1=Matzen 1988|1p=6|2a1=Ott 1972|2p=19}} Gehring has suggested that a facial scar she obtained in an automobile accident was a factor in this decision</span>
				<span class='text'>Fearing that the scar—which ran across her cheek—would ruin her career, the 17-year-old had an early [[plastic surgery]] procedure to make it less visible</span>
				<span class='text'>For the remainder of her career, Lombard learned to hide the mark with make-up and careful lighting</span>
