				<span class='text'>Humason]]'s measurements</span>
				<span class='text'>He found a rough proportionality of these objects' distances with their redshifts,&lt;ref name=&quot;HubblesLaw&quot; /&gt; nowadays termed [[Hubble's law]]</span>
				<span class='text'>et the reason for the redshift remained unclear</span>
				<span class='text'>It was [[Georges Lemaître]], a Belgian Catholic priest and physicist, who found that Hubble's observations supported the [[FRW metric|Friedmann model]] of an expanding universe based on Einstein's equations for [[General Relativity]], which is now known as the [[Big Bang]] theory</span>
				<span class='text'>This meant, the greater the distance between any two galaxies, the greater their relative speed of separation</span>
				<span class='text'>If interpreted that way, Hubble's measurements on 46 galaxies lead to a value for the [[Hubble Constant]] of 500&amp;nbsp;km/s/Mpc, which is much higher than the currently accepted value due to errors in their distance calibrations</span>
				<span class='text'>ubble himself remained doubtful about Lemaître's interpretation</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1931 he wrote a letter to the Dutch cosmologist [[Willem de Sitter]] expressing his opinion on the theoretical interpretation of the redshift-distance relation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hubble's diagram and cosmic expansion|author=Robert P</span>

				<span class='text'>The interpretation, we feel, should be left to you and the very few others who are competent to discuss the matter with authority</span>
				<span class='text'>}Today, the &quot;apparent velocities&quot; in question are understood as an increase in [[proper distance]] that occurs due to the [[metric expansion of space|expansion of space]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Light traveling through stretching space will experience a Hubble-type redshift, a mechanism different from the [[Doppler effect]] (although the two mechanisms become equivalent descriptions related by a [[coordinate transformation]] for nearby galaxies)</span>
				<span class='text'>n the 1930s, Hubble was involved in determining the distribution of galaxies and [[shape of the universe|spatial curvature]]</span>
				<span class='text'>These data seemed to indicate that the universe was [[Euclidean geometry|flat]] and homogeneous, but there was a deviation from flatness at large redshifts</span>
				<span class='text'>According to [[Allan Sandage]],{{quote|Hubble believed that his count data gave a more reasonable result concerning spatial curvature if the redshift correction was made assuming no recession</span>
				<span class='text'>To the very end of his writings he maintained this position, favouring (or at the very least keeping open) the model where no true expansion exists, and therefore that the redshift &quot;represents a hitherto unrecognized principle of nature</span>

				<span class='text'>When Einstein learned of Hubble's redshifts, he immediately realized that the expansion predicted by General Relativity must be real, and in later life he said that changing his equations was &quot;the biggest blunder of [his] life</span>

				<span class='text'>Hubble spent much of the later part of his career attempting to have astronomy considered an area of physics, instead of being its own science</span>
				<span class='text'>He did this largely so that astronomers—including himself—could be recognized by the Nobel Prize Committee for their valuable contributions to astrophysics</span>
				<span class='text'>This campaign was unsuccessful in Hubble's lifetime, but shortly after his death, the [[Nobel Prize]] Committee decided that astronomical work would be eligible for the physics prize</span>
