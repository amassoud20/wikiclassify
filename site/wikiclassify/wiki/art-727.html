				<span class='text'>150–151 (1224), King Saud University&lt;/ref&gt;A contemporary of Averroes, [[Abdelwahid al-Marrakushi]] writing in 1224, reported that there were secret and public reasons for his falling out of favor with Yaqub al-Mansour:&lt;ref name=&quot;Mo3jib&quot; /&gt;{{quote| text=And in his days [Yaqub al-Mansur], Abu al-Walid Ibn Rushd faced his severe ordeal and there were two causes for this; one is known and the other is secret</span>
				<span class='text'>The secret cause, which was the major reason, is that Abu al-Walid [Averroes] —may God have mercy on his soul— when summarizing, commenting and expending upon Aristotle's book &quot;[[History of Animals]]&quot; wrote: &quot;And I saw the [[Giraffe]] at the garden of the king of the Berbers&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;br /&gt;And that is the same way he would mention another king of some other people or land, as it is frequently done by writers, but he omitted that those working for the service of the king should glorify him and observe the usual protocol</span>
				<span class='text'>This was why they held a grudge against him [Averroes] but initially, they did not show it and in reality, Abu al-Walid wrote that inadvertently</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>hen a number of his enemies in Cordoba, who were jealous of him and were competing with him both in knowledge and nobility, went to Yaqub al-Mansur with excerpts of Abu Walid's work on some old philosophers which were in his own handwriting</span>
				<span class='text'>They took one phrase out of context that said: &quot;and it was shown that Venus is one of the Gods&quot; and presented it to the king who then summoned the chiefs and noblemen of [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Córdoba]] and said to Abu al-Walid in front of them &quot;Is this your handwriting?&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Abu al-Walid then denied and the king said &quot;May God curse the one who wrote this&quot; and ordered that Abu al-Walid be exiled and all the philosophy books to be gathered and burned</span>

				<span class='text'>He wrote three types of commentaries</span>

				<span class='text'>Al-Ghazali argued that Aristotelianism, especially as presented in the writings of [[Avicenna]], was self-contradictory and an affront to the teachings of [[Islam]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Averroes's rebuttal was two-pronged: he contended both that al-Ghazali's arguments were mistaken and that, in any case, the system of Avicenna was a distortion of genuine Aristotelianism so that al-Ghazali was aiming at the wrong target</span>

				<span class='text'>n ''Kitab al-Kashf'', which argued against the proofs of Islam advanced by the [[Ash'ari]]te school and discussed what proofs, on the popular level, should be used instead</span>
				<span class='text'>==System of philosophy==={{main|Averroism}}Averroes tried to reconcile Aristotle's system of thought with [[Islam]]</span>
				<span class='text'>According to him, there is no conflict between [[religion]] and [[philosophy]], rather that they are different ways of reaching the same truth</span>
				<span class='text'>He believed in the [[eternity]] of the [[universe]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also held that the [[soul]] is divided into two parts, one individual and one divine; while the individual soul is not eternal, all humans at the basic level share one and the same divine soul</span>
				<span class='text'>Averroes has two kinds of Knowledge of Truth</span>
				<span class='text'>The first being his knowledge of truth of religion being based in faith and thus could not be tested, nor did it require training to understand</span>
				<span class='text'>The second knowledge of truth is philosophy, which was reserved for an elite few who had the intellectual capacity to undertake its study</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|200px|thumb|right|Averroes, detail of the fresco ''[[The School of Athens]]'' by [[Raphael]]</span>
				<span class='text'>]Averroes is most famous for his commentaries of Aristotle's works, which had been mostly forgotten in the [[Western world|West]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Before 1150, only a few of Aristotle's works existed in translation in Latin Europe, although the tradition of great philosophers and poets of antiquity continued to be studied and copied in the Greek [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It was to some degree through the [[Latin language|Latin]] translations of Averroes's work beginning in the thirteenth century, that the legacy of Aristotle was recovered in the Latin West</span>
				<span class='text'>verroes's work on Aristotle spans almost three decades, and he wrote commentaries on almost all of Aristotle's work except for Aristotle's ''Politics'', to which he did not have access</span>
				<span class='text'>Hebrew translations of his work also had a lasting impact on [[Jewish philosophy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Moses Maimonides]], [[Samuel ibn Tibbon|Samuel Ben Tibbon]], Juda Ben Solomon Choen, and [[Shem-Tov ibn Falaquera|Shem Tob Ben Joseph Falaquera]] were Jewish philosophers influenced by Averroes</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvard citation|Fakhry|2001|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ideas were assimilated by [[Siger of Brabant]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] and others (especially in the [[University of Paris]]) within the [[Christian]] [[scholasticism|scholastic]] tradition which valued Aristotelian logic</span>
				<span class='text'>Famous scholastics such as Aquinas did not refer to him by name, simply calling him &quot;The Commentator&quot; and calling Aristotle &quot;The Philosopher</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;  Averroes had no discernible influence on Islamic philosophic thought until modern times</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvard citation|Leaman|2002|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; His death coincides with a change in the culture of Al-Andalus</span>
				<span class='text'> In his work ''Fasl al-Maqāl'' (translated a</span>
				<span class='text'>o</span>
				<span class='text'>{Clarify|date=November 2014}} as ''The Decisive Treatise''), he stresses the importance of analytical thinking as a prerequisite to interpret the [[Qur'an]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Jurisprudence and law==Averroes is also a highly regarded legal scholar of the [[Maliki]] school</span>
				<span class='text'>Perhaps his best-known work in this field is &quot;Bidāyat al-Mujtahid wa Nihāyat al-Muqtaṣid, &quot; a textbook of Maliki doctrine in a comparative framework, which is rendered in English as ''The Distinguished Jurist's Primer''&lt;ref&gt;Nyazee, The Distinguished Jurist's Primer, 2 vols</span>
				<span class='text'>(Reading: Garnet Publishing 1994 &amp; 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;—</span>
				<span class='text'>He is also the author of &quot;al-Bayān wa'l-Taḥṣīl, wa'l-Sharḥ wa'l-Tawjīh wa'l-Ta`līl fi Masā'il al-Mustakhraja, &quot; a long and detailed commentary based on the &quot;Mustakhraja&quot; of Muḥammad al-`Utbī al-Qurtubī</span>
				<span class='text'>=Legacy==* Reflecting the deference that some [[medieval]] [[Europe]]an scholars paid to him, Averroes is named by [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] in ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'' along with the thinkers and creative minds of ancient Greece and Rome whose spirits dwell in &quot;the place that favor owes to fame&quot; in [[Limbo]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Averroes appears in a short story by [[Jorge Luis Borges]], entitled &quot;[[Averroes's Search]]&quot;, in which he is portrayed trying to find the meanings of the words ''[[tragedy]]'' and ''[[comedy]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>He is briefly mentioned in the novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' by [[James Joyce]] alongside [[Maimonides]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He appears to be waiting outside the walls of the ancient city of Cordoba in [[Alamgir Hashmi]]'s poem &quot;In Cordoba&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'> The claim that Averroes deserves equal respect with Maimonides got the fictional Balthazar Abrabanel banished from Amsterdam by the Amsterdam rabbinate in Eric Flint's novel ''1634''</span>
				<span class='text'> Averroes is also the title of a play called &quot;The Gladius and The Rose&quot;, written by Tunisian writer [[Mohamed Ghozzi]], and which took first prize in the theater festival in Charjah in 1999</span>
				<span class='text'> In his [[Joseph Anton: A Memoir|memoir]], persecuted British Indian novelist [[Salman Rushdie]] recalls that his father adopted the family name &quot;Rushdie&quot; in honour of Averroes (Ibn Rushd)</span>
				<span class='text'>Ibn Rushd also appears as a character in Rushdie's novel, &quot;[[Two Years Eight Months and Twenty-Eight Nights]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'> The [[asteroid]] [[8318 Averroes]] was named in his honor</span>
				<span class='text'>* Plant genus ''[[Averrhoa]]'' was named after him</span>
				<span class='text'> A [[lunar crater]], [[Ibn-Rushd (crater)|ibn Rushd]], was also named in his honor* The Muslim pop musician [[Kareem Salama]] composed and performed a song in 2007 titled &quot;Aristotle and Averroes&quot;</span>
