				<span class='text'>vg|right|230px|alt=signature written in ink in a flowing script]]]]'''Wilhelm Richard Wagner''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|ɑː|ɡ|n|ər}}; {{IPA-de|ˈʁiçaʁt&lt;!-- Do not change this without a source --&gt; ˈvaːɡnɐ|lang}}; 22 May 1813{{spaced ndash}}13 February 1883) was a German composer, theatre director, [[polemic]]ist, and conductor who is primarily known for his operas (or, as some of his later works were later known, &quot;music dramas&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>Unlike most opera composers, Wagner wrote both the [[libretto]] and the music for each of his stage works</span>
				<span class='text'>Initially establishing his reputation as a composer of works in the [[romanticism|romantic]] vein of [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]] and [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]], Wagner revolutionised opera through his concept of the ''[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]'' (&quot;total work of art&quot;), by which he sought to synthesise the poetic, visual, musical and dramatic arts, with music subsidiary to drama, and which was announced in a series of essays between 1849 and 1852</span>
				<span class='text'>Wagner realised these ideas most fully in the first half of the four-opera cycle ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' (''The Ring of the [[Nibelung]]'')</span>
				<span class='text'>is compositions, particularly those of his later period, are notable for their complex [[texture (music)|textures]], rich [[harmony|harmonies]] and [[orchestration]], and the elaborate use of [[leitmotif]]s—musical phrases associated with individual characters, places, ideas or plot elements</span>
				<span class='text'>His advances in musical language, such as extreme [[chromaticism]] and quickly shifting [[tonality|tonal centres]], greatly influenced the development of classical music</span>
				<span class='text'>His ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' is sometimes described as marking the start of modern music</span>
				<span class='text'>agner had his own opera house built, the [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus]], which embodied many novel design features</span>
				<span class='text'>It was here that the ''Ring'' and ''[[Parsifal]]'' received their premieres and where his [[Bayreuth canon|most important stage works]] continue to be performed in an [[Bayreuth Festival|annual festival run by his descendants]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His thoughts on the relative contributions of music and drama in opera were to change again, and he reintroduced some traditional forms into his last few stage works, including ''[[Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg]]'' (''The Mastersingers of Nuremberg'')</span>
				<span class='text'>ntil his final years, Wagner's life was characterised by political exile, turbulent love affairs, poverty and repeated flight from his creditors</span>
				<span class='text'>His controversial writings on music, drama and politics have attracted extensive comment in recent decades, especially where they express [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] sentiments</span>
				<span class='text'>The effect of his ideas can be traced in many of the arts throughout the 20th century; their influence spread beyond composition into conducting, philosophy, literature, the [[visual arts]] and theatre</span>

				<span class='text'>He was however an ethnic [[Germans|German]], the ninth child of Carl Friedrich Wagner, who was a clerk in the Leipzig police service, and his wife, Johanna Rosine (née Paetz), the daughter of a baker</span>

				<span class='text'>The others were Wagner's brothers Albert and Carl Julius, and his sisters Rosalie, Luise, Clara and Ottilie</span>
				<span class='text'>All of these, except the goldsmith Carl Julius, were to have careers connected with the stage</span>
				<span class='text'>Wagner also had a younger half-sister, Caecilie, born to his mother and her second husband Geyer in 1815</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Millington (1992) 97&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Wagner family tree]]</span>
				<span class='text'>group=n}} Wagner's father Carl died of [[typhus]] six months after Richard's birth, after which Johanna began living with Carl's friend, the actor and playwright [[Ludwig Geyer]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Newman (1976) I, 6&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1814 Johanna and Geyer probably married—although no documentation of this has been found in the Leipzig church registers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gutman (1990) 7 and n</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; She and her family moved to Geyer's residence in [[Dresden]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Until he was fourteen, Wagner was known as Wilhelm Richard Geyer</span>
				<span class='text'>He almost certainly thought that Geyer was his biological father</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Newman (1976) I, 9&lt;/ref&gt;Geyer's love of the theatre came to be shared by his stepson, and Wagner took part in his performances</span>
				<span class='text'>In [[Mein Leben (Wagner)|his autobiography]] ''Mein Leben'', Wagner recalled once playing the part of an angel</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wagner (1992) 5&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1820, Wagner was enrolled at Pastor Wetzel's school at Possendorf, near Dresden, where he received a little piano instruction from his Latin teacher</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Newman (1976) I, 32–3&lt;/ref&gt; He struggled to play a proper [[Scale (music)|scale]] at the keyboard and preferred playing theatre overtures [[Learning music by ear|by ear]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Following Geyer's death in 1821, Richard was sent to the [[Kreuzschule]], the boarding school of the [[Dresdner Kreuzchor]], at the expense of Geyer's brother</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Newman (1976) I, 45–55&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of nine he was hugely impressed by the [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] elements of [[Carl Maria von Weber]]'s opera ''[[Der Freischütz]]'', which he saw Weber conduct</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gutman (1990) 78&lt;/ref&gt; At this period Wagner entertained ambitions as a playwright</span>
				<span class='text'>His first creative effort, listed in the ''[[Wagner-Werk-Verzeichnis]]'' (the standard listing of Wagner's works) as WWV 1, was a tragedy called ''[[Leubald]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Begun at school in 1826, it was strongly influenced by [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Wagner was determined to set it to music, and persuaded his family to allow him music lessons</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wagner (1992) 25–7&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|This sketch is referred to alternatively as ''Leubald und Adelaide''</span>
				<span class='text'>group=n}}By 1827, the family had returned to Leipzig</span>
				<span class='text'>Wagner's first lessons in [[harmony]] were taken during 1828–31 with Christian Gottlieb Müller</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Newman (1976) I, 63, 71&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1828 he first heard [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>7 (Beethoven)|7th Symphony]] and then, in March, the same composer's [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>9 (Beethoven)|9th Symphony]] (both at the [[Gewandhaus]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Beethoven became a major inspiration, and Wagner wrote a piano transcription of the 9th Symphony</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wagner (1992) 35–6&lt;/ref&gt; He was also greatly impressed by a performance of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s [[Requiem (Mozart)|Requiem]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Newman (1976) I, 62&lt;/ref&gt; Wagner's early [[piano sonata]]s and his first attempts at orchestral [[overture]]s date from this period</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Newman (1976) I, 76–7&lt;/ref&gt;In 1829 he saw a performance by [[dramatic soprano]] [[Wilhelmine Schröder-Devrient]], and she became his ideal of the fusion of drama and music in opera</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''Mein Leben'', Wagner wrote &quot;When I look back across my entire life I find no event to place beside this in the impression it produced on me&quot;, and claimed that the &quot;profoundly human and ecstatic performance of this incomparable artist&quot; kindled in him an &quot;almost demonic fire</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wagner (1992) 37&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Wagner claimed to have seen Schröder-Devrient in the title role of ''[[Fidelio]]'', but it seems more likely that he saw her performance as Romeo in [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]]'s ''[[I Capuleti e i Montecchi]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Millington (2001) 133&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}}In 1831, Wagner enrolled at the [[Leipzig University]], where he became a member of the Saxon [[Studentenverbindung|student fraternity]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wagner (1992) 44&lt;/ref&gt; He also took composition lessons with the [[Thomaskantor]] [[Christian Theodor Weinlig|Theodor Weinlig]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Newman (1976) I, 85–6&lt;/ref&gt; Weinlig was so impressed with Wagner's musical ability that he refused any payment for his lessons</span>
				<span class='text'>He arranged for his pupil's Piano Sonata in B-flat major (which was consequently dedicated to him) to be published as Wagner's Op</span>
				<span class='text'>1</span>
				<span class='text'>A year later, Wagner composed his [[Symphony in C major (Wagner)|Symphony in C major]], a Beethovenesque work performed in Prague in 1832&lt;ref&gt;Millington (2001) 309&lt;/ref&gt; and at the Leipzig Gewandhaus in 1833</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Newman (1976) I, 95&lt;/ref&gt; He then began to work on an opera, ''[[Die Hochzeit]]'' (''The Wedding''), which he never completed</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Newman (1976) I, 98&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, at the age of 20, Wagner composed his first complete opera, ''[[Die Feen]]'' (''The Fairies'')</span>
				<span class='text'>This work, which imitated the style of Weber, went unproduced until half a century later, when it was premiered in [[Munich]] shortly after the composer's death in 1883</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Millington 2001 271&quot;&gt;Millington (2001) 271–3&lt;/ref&gt;Having returned to Leipzig in 1834, Wagner held a brief appointment as musical director at the opera house in [[Magdeburg]]&lt;ref&gt;Newman (1976) I, 173&lt;/ref&gt; during which he wrote ''[[Das Liebesverbot]]'' (''The Ban on Love''), based on Shakespeare's ''[[Measure for Measure]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>This was staged at Magdeburg in 1836 but closed before the second performance; this, together with the financial collapse of the theatre company employing him, left the composer with serious money problems</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Newman (1976) I, 214&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1837, Minna left Wagner for another man;&lt;ref&gt;Newman (1976) I, 217&lt;/ref&gt; this was but the first débâcle of a troubled marriage</span>
				<span class='text'>In June 1837, Wagner moved to [[Riga]] (then in the [[Russian Empire]]), where he became music director of the local opera;&lt;ref&gt;Newman (1976) I, 226–7&lt;/ref&gt; having in this capacity engaged Minna's sister Amalie (also a singer) for the theatre, he presently resumed relations with Minna during 1838</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Newman (1976) I, 229–31&lt;/ref&gt;By 1839, the couple had amassed such large debts that they fled Riga to avoid their creditors;&lt;ref&gt;Newman (1976) I, 242–3&lt;/ref&gt; debt would plague Wagner for most of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Millington (2001) 116–8&lt;/ref&gt; Initially they took a stormy sea passage to London,&lt;ref&gt;Newman (1976) I, 249–50&lt;/ref&gt; from which Wagner drew the inspiration for ''Der fliegende Holländer'' (''[[The Flying Dutchman (opera)|The Flying Dutchman]]''), with a plot based on a sketch by [[Heinrich Heine]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Richard made a scant living writing articles and arranging operas by other composers, largely on behalf of the [[Maurice Schlesinger|Schlesinger]] publishing house</span>

				<span class='text'>With the strong support of [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]],&lt;ref&gt;Newman (1976) I, 316&lt;/ref&gt; it was accepted for performance by the Dresden [[Semperoper#History|Court Theatre]] (''Hofoper'') in the [[Kingdom of Saxony]] and in 1842, Wagner moved to Dresden</span>
				<span class='text'>His relief at returning to Germany was recorded in his &quot;[[Autobiographic Sketch (Wagner)|Autobiographic Sketch]]&quot; of 1842, where he wrote that, en route from Paris, &quot;For the first time I saw the [[Rhine]]—with hot tears in my eyes, I, poor artist, swore eternal fidelity to my German fatherland</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wagner (1994c) 19&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rienzi'' was staged to considerable acclaim on 20 October</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Millington (2001) 274&lt;/ref&gt;Wagner lived in Dresden for the next six years, eventually being appointed the Royal Saxon Court Conductor</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Newman (1976) I, 325–509&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, he staged there ''Der fliegende Holländer'' (2 January 1843)&lt;ref&gt;Millington (2001) 276&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tannhäuser (opera)|''Tannhäuser'']] (19 October 1845),&lt;ref&gt;Millington (2001) 279&lt;/ref&gt; the first two of his three middle-period operas</span>
				<span class='text'>Wagner also mixed with artistic circles in Dresden, including the composer [[Ferdinand Hiller]] and the architect [[Gottfried Semper]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Millington (2001) 31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conway (2012) 192–3&lt;/ref&gt;Wagner's involvement in [[left-wing politics]] abruptly ended his welcome in Dresden</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gutman (1990) 118&lt;/ref&gt; He was also influenced by the ideas of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] and [[Ludwig Feuerbach]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Millington (2001) 140–4&lt;/ref&gt; Widespread discontent came to a head in 1849, when the unsuccessful [[May Uprising in Dresden]] broke out, in which Wagner played a [[May Uprising in Dresden#Prominent figures among the revolutionaries|minor supporting role]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Nevertheless, Wagner was in grim personal straits, isolated from the German musical world and without any regular income</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1850, Julie, the wife of his friend Karl Ritter, began to pay him a small pension which she maintained until 1859</span>
				<span class='text'>With help from her friend Jessie Laussot this was to have been augmented to an annual sum of 3000 [[Thaler]]s per year; but this plan was abandoned when Wagner began an affair with Mme</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gutman (1990) 142&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}}Wagner's primary published output during his first years in Zürich was a set of essays</span>
				<span class='text'>In &quot;[[The Artwork of the Future]]&quot; (1849), he described a vision of opera as ''[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]'' (&quot;total work of art&quot;), in which the various arts such as music, song, dance, poetry, visual arts and stagecraft were unified</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;[[Judaism in Music]]&quot; (1850)&lt;ref&gt;Full English translation in Wagner (1995c)&lt;/ref&gt; was the first of Wagner's writings to feature [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] views</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Conway (2012) 197–8&lt;/ref&gt; In this polemic Wagner argued, frequently using traditional antisemitic abuse, that Jews had no connection to the German spirit, and were thus only capable of producing shallow and artificial music</span>
				<span class='text'>According to him, they composed music to achieve popularity and, thereby, financial success, as opposed to creating genuine works of art</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Conway (2012) 261–3&lt;/ref&gt;In &quot;[[Opera and Drama]]&quot; (1851), Wagner described the [[aesthetics]] of drama that he was using to create the ''Ring'' operas</span>
				<span class='text'>Before leaving Dresden, Wagner had drafted a scenario that eventually became the four-opera cycle ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>He initially [[Der Ring des Nibelungen: Composition of the poem|wrote the libretto]] for a single opera, ''Siegfrieds Tod'' (''Siegfried's Death''), in 1848</span>
				<span class='text'>After arriving in Zürich he expanded the story with the opera ''Der junge Siegfried'' (''Young Siegfried''), which explored the [[Sigurd|hero's]] background</span>
				<span class='text'>He completed the text of the cycle by writing the libretti for ''[[Die Walküre]]'' (''The [[Valkyrie]]'') and ''[[Das Rheingold]]'' (''The Rhine Gold'') and revising the other libretti to agree with his new concept, completing them in 1852</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Millington (2001) 297&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of opera expressed in &quot;Opera and Drama&quot; and in other essays effectively renounced the operas he had previously written, up to and including ''Lohengrin''</span>
				<span class='text'>Partly in an attempt to explain his change of views, Wagner published in 1851 the autobiographical &quot;[[A Communication to My Friends]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See Treadwell (2008) 182–90</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This contained his first public announcement of what was to become the ''Ring'' cycle:&lt;blockquote&gt;I shall never write an ''Opera'' more</span>

				<span class='text'>]One source of inspiration for ''Tristan und Isolde'' was the philosophy of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], notably his ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', to which Wagner had been introduced in 1854 by his poet friend [[Georg Herwegh]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Wagner later called this the most important event of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wagner (1992) 508–10</span>
				<span class='text'>Others agree on the profound importance of this work to Wagner—see Magee (2000) 133–4</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; His personal circumstances certainly made him an easy convert to what he understood to be Schopenhauer's philosophy, a deeply pessimistic view of the human condition</span>
				<span class='text'>He remained an adherent of Schopenhauer for the rest of his life</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Magee (2000) 276–8</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;One of Schopenhauer's doctrines was that music held a supreme role in the arts as a direct expression of the world's essence, namely, blind, impulsive will</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Magee (1988) 77–8&lt;/ref&gt; This doctrine contradicted Wagner's view, expressed in &quot;Opera and Drama&quot;, that the music in opera had to be subservient to the drama</span>
				<span class='text'>Wagner scholars have argued that Schopenhauer's influence caused Wagner to assign a more commanding role to music in his later operas, including the latter half of the ''Ring'' cycle, which he had yet to compose</span>

				<span class='text'>Wagner met the Wesendoncks, who were both great admirers of his music, in Zürich in 1852</span>
				<span class='text'>From May 1853 onwards Wesendonck made several loans to Wagner to finance his household expenses in Zürich,&lt;ref&gt;Newman (1976) II, 415–8, 516–8&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1857 placed a cottage on his estate at Wagner's disposal,&lt;ref&gt;Gutman (1990) 168–9; Newman (1976) II, 508–9&lt;/ref&gt; which became known as the ''Asyl'' (&quot;asylum&quot; or &quot;place of rest&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>During this period, Wagner's growing passion for his patron's wife inspired him to put aside work on the ''Ring'' cycle (which was not resumed for the next twelve years) and begin work on ''Tristan''</span>

				<span class='text'>(The premiere had been scheduled for 15 May, but was delayed by bailiffs acting for Wagner's creditors,&lt;ref&gt;Gregor-Dellin (1983) 354&lt;/ref&gt; and also because the Isolde, [[Malvina Garrigues|Malvina Schnorr von Carolsfeld]], was hoarse and needed time to recover</span>

				<span class='text'>To raise funds for the construction, &quot;[[International Association of Wagner Societies|Wagner societies]]&quot; were formed in several cities,&lt;ref&gt;Newman (1976) IV, 392–3&lt;/ref&gt; and Wagner began touring Germany conducting concerts</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gregor-Dellin (1983) 409–18&lt;/ref&gt; By the spring of 1873, only a third of the required funds had been raised; further pleas to Ludwig were initially ignored, but early in 1874, with the project on the verge of collapse, the King relented and provided a loan</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Millington (1992) 287&lt;/ref&gt; The 1876 Festival consisted of three full ''Ring'' cycles (under the baton of [[Hans Richter (conductor)|Hans Richter]])</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Spotts (1994) 61–2&lt;/ref&gt; At the end, critical reactions ranged between that of the Norwegian composer [[Edvard Grieg]], who thought the work &quot;divinely composed&quot;, and that of the French newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]]'', which called the music &quot;the dream of a lunatic&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Spotts (1994) 71–2&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst the disillusioned were Wagner's friend and disciple [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], who, having published his eulogistic essay &quot;Richard Wagner in Bayreuth&quot; before the festival as part of his ''[[Untimely Meditations]]'', was bitterly disappointed by what he saw as Wagner's pandering to increasingly exclusivist German nationalism; his breach with Wagner began at this time</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Newman (1976) IV, 517–39&lt;/ref&gt; The festival firmly established Wagner as an artist of European, and indeed world, importance: attendees included [[Kaiser Wilhelm I]], the Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil]], [[Anton Bruckner]], [[Camille Saint-Saëns]] and [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Spotts (1994) 66–7&lt;/ref&gt;Wagner was far from satisfied with the Festival; Cosima recorded that months later, his attitude towards the productions was &quot;Never again, never again!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cosima Wagner (1994) 270&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the festival finished with a deficit of about 150,000 marks</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Newman (1976) IV, 542</span>
				<span class='text'>This was equivalent at the time to about $37,500</span>

				<span class='text'>Later in life, Wagner said that he did not consider these works to be part of his [[wikt:oeuvre|''oeuvre'']]; none of them has ever been performed at the Bayreuth Festival,&lt;ref&gt;Magee (1988) 26&lt;/ref&gt; and they have been performed only rarely in the last hundred years (although the overture to ''Rienzi'' is an occasional concert piece)</span>

				<span class='text'>]Wagner's late dramas are considered his masterpieces</span>
				<span class='text'>''Der Ring des Nibelungen'', commonly referred to as the ''Ring'' or &quot;''Ring'' cycle&quot;, is a set of four operas based loosely on figures and elements of [[Germanic mythology]]—particularly from the later [[Norse mythology]]—notably the [[Old Norse]] ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' and ''[[Volsunga Saga]]'', and the [[Middle High German]] ''[[Nibelungenlied]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See Millington (2001) 286; Donington (1979) 128–30, 141, 210–2</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Wagner specifically developed the libretti for these operas according to his interpretation of ''[[Alliterative verse#German forms|Stabreim]]'', highly alliterative rhyming verse-pairs used in old Germanic poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Millington (1992) 239–40, 266–7&lt;/ref&gt; They were also influenced by Wagner's concepts of [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] drama, in which [[tetralogy|tetralogies]] were a component of [[Athenian festivals]], and which he had amply discussed in his essay &quot;[[Oper und Drama]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Millington (2008) 74&lt;/ref&gt;The first two components of the ''Ring'' cycle were ''[[Das Rheingold]]'' (''The Rhinegold''), which was completed in 1854, and ''[[Die Walküre]]'' (''The [[Valkyrie]]''), which was finished in 1856</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''Das Rheingold'', with its &quot;relentlessly talky 'realism' [and] the absence of lyrical '[[Number (music)|numbers]]{{'&quot;}},&lt;ref&gt;Grey (2008) 86&lt;/ref&gt; Wagner came very close to the musical ideals of his 1849–51 essays</span>
				<span class='text'>''Die Walküre'', which contains what is virtually a traditional [[aria]] (Siegmund's ''Winterstürme'' in the first act), and the quasi-[[choral music|choral]] appearance of the Valkyries themselves, shows more &quot;operatic&quot; traits, but has been assessed by Barry Millington as &quot;the music drama that most satisfactorily embodies the theoretical principles of 'Oper und Drama'</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;A thoroughgoing synthesis of poetry and music is achieved without any notable sacrifice in musical expression</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Millington (undated b)&lt;/ref&gt;===== ''Tristan und Isolde'' and ''Die Meistersinger'' =====While composing the opera ''[[Siegfried (opera)|Siegfried]]'', the third part of the ''Ring'' cycle, Wagner interrupted work on it and between 1857 and 1864 wrote the tragic love story ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' and his only mature comedy ''[[Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg]]'' (''The Mastersingers of Nuremberg''), two works that are also part of the regular operatic canon</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Rose (1981) 15&lt;/ref&gt; Completed in 1859, the work was given its first performance in Munich, conducted by Bülow, in June 1865</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Millington (2001) 298&lt;/ref&gt;''Die Meistersinger'' was originally conceived by Wagner in 1845 as a sort of comic pendant to ''Tannhäuser''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McClatchie (2008) 134&lt;/ref&gt; Like ''Tristan'', it was premiered in Munich under the baton of Bülow, on 21 June 1868, and became an immediate success</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gutman (1990) 282–3&lt;/ref&gt; Barry Millington describes ''Meistersinger'' as &quot;a rich, perceptive music drama widely admired for its warm humanity&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;Millington (undated c)&lt;/ref&gt; but because of its strong German [[nationalism|nationalist]] overtones, it is also cited by some as an example of Wagner's reactionary politics and antisemitism</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Weiner (1997) 66–72</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===== Completing the ''Ring'' =====When Wagner returned to writing the music for the last act of ''Siegfried'' and for ''[[Götterdämmerung]]'' (''Twilight of the Gods''), as the final part of the ''Ring'', his style had changed once more to something more recognisable as &quot;operatic&quot; than the aural world of ''Rheingold'' and ''Walküre'', though it was still thoroughly stamped with his own originality as a composer and suffused with leitmotifs</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Millington (2001) 294–5&lt;/ref&gt; This was in part because the libretti of the four ''Ring'' operas had been written in reverse order, so that the book for ''Götterdämmerung'' was conceived more &quot;traditionally&quot; than that of ''Rheingold'';&lt;ref&gt;Millington (2001) 286&lt;/ref&gt; still, the self-imposed strictures of the ''Gesamtkunstwerk'' had become relaxed</span>
				<span class='text'>The differences also result from Wagner's development as a composer during the period in which he wrote ''Tristan'', ''Meistersinger'' and the Paris version of ''Tannhäuser''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Puffett (1984) 43&lt;/ref&gt; From act 3 of ''Siegfried'' onwards, the ''Ring'' becomes more [[chromaticism|chromatic]] melodically, more complex harmonically and more developmental in its treatment of leitmotifs</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Puffett (1984) 48–9&lt;/ref&gt;Wagner took 26 years from writing the first draft of a libretto in 1848 until he completed ''Götterdämmerung'' in 1874</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''Ring'' takes about 15 hours to perform&lt;ref&gt;Millington (2001) 285&lt;/ref&gt; and is the only undertaking of such size to be regularly presented on the world's stages</span>
				<span class='text'>==== ''Parsifal'' =====Wagner's final opera, ''[[Parsifal]]'' (1882), which was his only work written especially for his Bayreuth Festspielhaus and which is described in the score as a &quot;''Bühnenweihfestspiel''&quot; (&quot;festival play for the consecration of the stage&quot;), has a storyline suggested by elements of the legend of the [[Holy Grail]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It also carries elements of [[Buddhist]] renunciation suggested by Wagner's readings of Schopenhauer</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Millington (2001) 308&lt;/ref&gt; Wagner described it to Cosima as his &quot;last card&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; It remains controversial because of its treatment of Christianity, its eroticism, and its expression, as perceived by some commentators, of German nationalism and antisemitism</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Ulrike Kienzle has commented that &quot;Wagner's turn to Christian mythology, upon which the imagery and spiritual contents of ''Parsifal'' rest, is idiosyncratic and contradicts Christian [[dogma]] in many ways</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kienzle (2005) 81&lt;/ref&gt; Musically the opera has been held to represent a continuing development of the composer's style, and Barry Millington describes it as &quot;a diaphanous score of unearthly beauty and refinement&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Notably from ''Tristan und Isolde'' onwards, he explored the limits of the traditional tonal system, which gave keys and chords their identity, pointing the way to [[atonality]] in the 20th century</span>
				<span class='text'>Some music historians date the beginning of [[modern classical music]] to the first notes of ''Tristan'', which include the so-called [[Tristan chord]]</span>

				<span class='text'>For a long period, many composers were inclined to align themselves with or against Wagner's music</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Anton Bruckner]] and [[Hugo Wolf]] were greatly indebted to him, as were [[César Franck]], [[Henri Duparc (composer)|Henri Duparc]], [[Ernest Chausson]], [[Jules Massenet]], [[Richard Strauss]], [[Alexander von Zemlinsky]], [[Hans Pfitzner]] and numerous others</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Taruskin (2009) 5–8&lt;/ref&gt; The harmonic revolutions of [[Claude Debussy]] and [[Arnold Schoenberg]] (both of whose ''oeuvres'' contain examples of tonal and [[atonality|atonal]] modernism) have often been traced back to ''Tristan'' and ''Parsifal''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Magee (1988) 54; Grey (2008) 228–9&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian form of operatic [[Realism (theatre)|realism]] known as [[verismo]] owed much to the Wagnerian concept of musical form</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Grey (2008) 226&lt;/ref&gt;Wagner made a major contribution to the principles and practice of conducting</span>
				<span class='text'>His essay &quot;About Conducting&quot; (1869)&lt;ref&gt;Wagner (1995a) 289–364&lt;/ref&gt; advanced [[Hector Berlioz]]'s technique of conducting and claimed that conducting was a means by which a musical work could be re-interpreted, rather than simply a mechanism for achieving orchestral unison</span>
				<span class='text'>He exemplified this approach in his own conducting, which was significantly more flexible than the disciplined approach of [[Felix Mendelssohn]]; in his view this also justified practices that would today be frowned upon, such as the rewriting of scores</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|180px|Eduard Hanslick|alt=A balding white man aged about 40 with a moustache]]Not all reaction to Wagner was positive</span>
				<span class='text'>For a time, German musical life divided into two factions, supporters of Wagner and supporters of [[Johannes Brahms]]; the latter, with the support of the powerful critic [[Eduard Hanslick]] (of whom Beckmesser in ''Meistersinger'' is in part a caricature) championed traditional forms and led the conservative front against Wagnerian innovations</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Millington (2001) 26, 127</span>
				<span class='text'>See also [[New German School]] and [[War of the Romantics]]&lt;/ref&gt; They were supported by the conservative leanings of some German music schools, including the [[Music school|conservatories]] at [[University of Music and Theatre Leipzig|Leipzig]] under [[Ignaz Moscheles]] and at [[Hochschule für Musik und Tanz Köln|Cologne]] under the direction of Ferdinand Hiller</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Sietz &amp; Wiegandt (undated)&lt;/ref&gt; Another Wagner detractor was the French composer [[Charles-Valentin Alkan]], who wrote to Hiller after attending Wagner's Paris concert on 25 January 1860 at which Wagner conducted the overtures to ''Der fliegende Holländer'' and ''Tannhäuser'', the preludes to ''Lohengrin'' and ''Tristan und Isolde'', and six other extracts from ''Tannhäuser'' and ''Lohengrin'': &quot;I had imagined that I was going to meet music of an innovative kind but was astonished to find a pale imitation of Berlioz&amp;nbsp;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Millington (2001) 164; Conway (2012) 198&lt;/ref&gt; There have been frequent suggestions that [[antisemitic]] stereotypes are represented in Wagner's operas</span>
				<span class='text'>The characters of Mime in the ''Ring'', Sixtus Beckmesser in ''Die Meistersinger,'' and Klingsor in ''Parsifal'' are sometimes claimed as Jewish representations, though they are not identified as such in the librettos of these operas</span>

				<span class='text'>group=n}} The topic of Wagner and the Jews is further complicated by allegations, which may have been credited by Wagner, that he himself was of Jewish ancestry, via his supposed father Geyer</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Conway (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;Some biographers have asserted that Wagner in his final years came to believe in the [[Racism|racialist]] philosophy of [[Arthur de Gobineau]], notably Gobineau's belief that Western society was doomed because of [[miscegenation]] between &quot;superior&quot; and &quot;inferior&quot; races</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Everett (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Robert Gutman, this theme is reflected in the opera ''Parsifal''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gutman (1990) 418 ff&lt;/ref&gt; Other biographers (such as Lucy Beckett) believe that this is not true, as the original drafts of the story date back to 1857 and Wagner had completed the libretto for ''Parsifal'' by 1877;&lt;ref&gt;Beckett (1981)&lt;/ref&gt; but he displayed no significant interest in Gobineau until 1880</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gutman (1990) 406&lt;/ref&gt;=== Other interpretations ===Wagner's ideas are amenable to socialist interpretations; many of his ideas on art were being formulated at the time of his revolutionary inclinations in the 1840s</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, for example, [[George Bernard Shaw]] wrote in ''[[The Perfect Wagnerite]]'' (1883):&lt;blockquote&gt;[Wagner's] picture of Niblunghome{{#tag:ref|Shaw's anglicization of ''Nibelheim'', the empire of Alberich in the ''Ring'' cycle</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Millington (2008) 81&lt;/ref&gt;The writer [[Robert Donington]] has produced a detailed, if controversial, [[Jungian psychology|Jungian]] interpretation of the ''Ring'' cycle, described as &quot;an approach to Wagner by way of his symbols&quot;, which, for example, sees the character of the goddess Fricka as part of her husband Wotan's &quot;inner femininity&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Donington (1979) 31, 72–5&lt;/ref&gt; Millington notes that [[Jean-Jacques Nattiez]] has also applied [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytical]] techniques in an evaluation of Wagner's life and works</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Nattiez (1993); Millington (2008) 82–3&lt;/ref&gt;=== Nazi appropriation ===[[Adolf Hitler]] was an admirer of Wagner's music and saw in his operas an embodiment of his own vision of the German nation; in a 1922 speech he claimed that Wagner's works glorified &quot;the heroic Teutonic nature&amp;nbsp;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Carr (2007) 184&lt;/ref&gt;Guido Fackler has researched evidence that indicates that it is possible that Wagner's music was used at the [[Dachau concentration camp]] in 1933–34 to &quot;reeducate&quot; [[political prisoner]]s by exposure to &quot;national music&quot;</span>
