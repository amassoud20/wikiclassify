				<span class='text'>While this exasperated some writers others admitted the director inspired them to do their very best work</span>
				<span class='text'>Hitchcock often emphasised that he took no screen credit for the writing of his films</span>
				<span class='text'>However over time the work of many of his writers has been attributed solely to Hitchcocks creative genius a misconception he rarely went out of his way to correct</span>
				<span class='text'>Notwithstanding his technical brilliance as a director Hitchcock relied on his writers a great deal</span>
				<span class='text'>teven DeRosa Writing with Hitchcock New York Faber and Faber 2001 p</span>
				<span class='text'>xi</span>
				<span class='text'>According to the majority of commentators Hitchcocks films were extensively storyboarded to the finest detail</span>
				<span class='text'>He was reported to have never even bothered looking through the  since he did not need to though in publicity photos he was shown doing so</span>
				<span class='text'>He also used this as an excuse to never have to change his films from his initial vision</span>
				<span class='text'>If a studio asked him to change a film he would claim that it was already shot in a single way and that there were no alternate takes to consider</span>
				<span class='text'>owever this view of Hitchcock as a director who relied more on pre production than on the actual production itself has been challenged by the book Hitchcock at Work written by Bill Krohn the American correspondent of </span>
				<span class='text'>Krohn after investigating several script revisions notes to other production personnel written by or to Hitchcock alongside inspection of storyboards and other production material has observed that Hitchcocks work often deviated from how the screenplay was written or how the film was originally envisioned</span>
				<span class='text'>He noted that the myth of storyboards in relation to Hitchcock often regurgitated by generations of commentators on his movies was to a great degree perpetuated by Hitchcock himself or the publicity arm of the studios</span>
				<span class='text'>A great example would be the celebrated crop spraying sequence of North by Northwest which was not storyboarded at all</span>
				<span class='text'>After the scene was filmed the publicity department asked Hitchcock to make storyboards to promote the film and Hitchcock in turn hired an artist to match the scenes in detail</span>
				<span class='text'>ven when storyboards were made scenes that were shot differed from them significantly</span>
				<span class='text'>Krohns extensive analysis of the production of Hitchcock classics like Notorious reveals that Hitchcock was flexible enough to change a films conception during its production</span>
				<span class='text'>Another example Krohn notes is the American remake of The Man Who Knew Too Much whose shooting schedule commenced without a finished script and moreover went over schedule something that as Krohn notes was not an uncommon occurrence on many of Hitchcocks films including  and </span>
				<span class='text'>While Hitchcock did do a great deal of preparation for all his movies he was fully cognizant that the actual film making process often deviated from the best laid plans and was flexible to adapt to the changes and needs of production as his films were not free from the normal hassles faced and common routines utilised during many other film productions</span>
				<span class='text'>rohns work also sheds light on Hitchcocks practice of generally shooting in chronological order which he notes sent many films over budget and over schedule and more importantly differed from the standard operating procedure of Hollywood in the Studio System Era</span>
				<span class='text'>Equally important is Hitchcocks tendency to shoot alternate takes of scenes</span>
				<span class='text'>This differed from coverage in that the films were not necessarily shot from varying angles so as to give the editor options to shape the film how he she chooses often under the producers aegis</span>
				<span class='text'>Rather they represented Hitchcocks tendency of giving himself options in the editing room where he would provide advice to his editors after viewing a rough cut of the work</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Krohn this and a great deal of other information revealed through his research of Hitchcocks personal papers script revisions and the like ute the notion of Hitchcock as a director who was always in control of his films whose vision of his films did not change during production which Krohn notes has remained the central long standing myth of Alfred Hitchcock</span>
				<span class='text'>is fastidiousness and attention to detail also found its way into each  for his films</span>
				<span class='text'>Hitchcock perred to work with the best talent of his day—film poster designers such as  and —who would produce posters that accurately represented his films</span>

				<span class='text'>Hitchcock simply did not tolerate the  approach as he believed that actors should only concentrate on their performances and leave work on script and character to the directors and screenwriters</span>
				<span class='text'>In a  interview he stated that the method actor is OK in the theatre because he has a free space to move about</span>
				<span class='text'>But when it comes to cutting the face and what he sees and so forth there must be some discipline</span>

				<span class='text'>It may have been made </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>when we used actors who were simultaneously performing in stage plays</span>
				<span class='text'>When they had a matinee and I suspected they were allowing themselves plenty of time for a very leisurely lunch</span>
				<span class='text'>And this meant that we had to shoot our scenes at breakneck speed so that the actors could get out on time</span>
				<span class='text'>I couldnt help feeling that if theyd been really conscientious theyd have swallowed their sandwich in the cab on the way to the theatre and get there in time to put on their make up and go on stage</span>
