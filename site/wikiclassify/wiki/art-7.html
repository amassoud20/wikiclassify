				<span class='text'>The film appears to have been shot in a single take, but it was actually shot in 10 takes ranging from 4-½ to 10 minutes each, a 10-minute length of film being the maximum that a camera's film magazine could hold at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>Some transitions between reels were hidden by having a dark object fill the entire screen for a moment</span>
				<span class='text'>Hitchcock used those points to hide the cut, and began the next take with the camera in the same place</span>
				<span class='text'>It featured [[James Stewart]] in the leading role, and was the first of four films that Stewart made with Hitchcock</span>
				<span class='text'>It was inspired by the [[Leopold and Loeb]] case of the 1920s</span>
				<span class='text'>'[[Under Capricorn]]'' (1949), set in nineteenth-century Australia, also used the short-lived technique of long takes, but to a more limited extent</span>

				<span class='text'>Sebastian ([[Claude Rains]]) in ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' has a clearly conflictual relationship with his mother, who is (correctly) suspicious of his new bride Alicia Huberman ([[Ingrid Bergman]])</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;whitington&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dowd&quot; /&gt; The famous victims in ''The Lodger'' are all blondes</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'', Hitchcock's glamorous blonde star, [[Madeleine Carroll]], is put in handcuffs</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' (1964), the title character (played by [[Tippi Hedren]]) is a [[thief]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''[[To Catch a Thief]]'' (1955), Francie ([[Grace Kelly]]) offers to help a man she believes is a burglar</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''[[Rear Window]]'', Lisa (Grace Kelly again) risks her life by breaking into Lars Thorwald's apartment</span>
				<span class='text'>The best-known example is in ''Psycho'' where [[Janet Leigh]]'s unfortunate character steals $40,000 and is murdered by a reclusive psychopath</span>
				<span class='text'>Hitchcock's last blonde heroine was [[Barbara Harris (actress)|Barbara Harris]] as a phony psychic turned amateur sleuth in ''[[Family Plot]]'' (1976), his final film</span>
				<span class='text'>In the same film, the diamond smuggler played by [[Karen Black]] could also fit that role, as she wears a long blonde wig in various scenes and becomes increasingly uncomfortable about her line of work</span>
				<span class='text'>The English 'Hitchcock blonde' was based on his preference for the heroines to have an “indirect” sex appeal of English women, ladylike in public, but whores in the bedroom, with Hitchcock stating to Truffaut:{{quote|I think the most interesting women, sexually, are the English women</span>
				<span class='text'>I feel that the English women, the Swedes, the northern Germans, and Scandinavians are a great deal more exciting than the Latin, the Italian, and the French women</span>

				<span class='text'>Actually, it's only when one enters the studio that one enters the area of compromise</span>
				<span class='text'>Really, the novelist has the best casting since he doesn't have to cope with the actors and all the rest</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; In an interview with Roger Ebert in 1969, Hitchcock elaborated further:{{quote|Once the screenplay is finished, I'd just as soon not make the film at all </span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot; |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=14 December 1969 |accessdate=26 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}In ''Writing with Hitchcock'', a book-length study of Hitchcock's working method with his writers, author Steven DeRosa noted that &quot;Although he rarely did any actual 'writing', especially on his Hollywood productions, Hitchcock supervised and guided his writers through every draft, insisting on a strict attention to detail and a preference for telling the story through visual rather than verbal means</span>
				<span class='text'>While this exasperated some writers, others admitted the director inspired them to do their very best work</span>
				<span class='text'>Hitchcock often emphasised that he took no screen credit for the writing of his films</span>
				<span class='text'>However, over time the work of many of his writers has been attributed solely to Hitchcock's creative genius, a misconception he rarely went out of his way to correct</span>
				<span class='text'>Notwithstanding his technical brilliance as a director, Hitchcock relied on his writers a great deal</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Steven DeRosa, ''Writing with Hitchcock'', New York: Faber and Faber, 2001, p</span>
				<span class='text'>xi</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Storyboards and production===According to the majority of commentators, Hitchcock's films were extensively storyboarded to the finest detail</span>
				<span class='text'>He was reported to have never even bothered looking through the [[viewfinder]], since he did not need to, though in publicity photos he was shown doing so</span>
				<span class='text'>He also used this as an excuse to never have to change his films from his initial vision</span>
				<span class='text'>If a studio asked him to change a film, he would claim that it was already shot in a single way, and that there were no alternate takes to consider</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Alfred Hitchcock by Jack Mitchell</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|left|Alfred Hitchcock]]However, this view of Hitchcock as a director who relied more on pre-production than on the actual production itself has been challenged by the book ''Hitchcock at Work'', written by Bill Krohn, the American correspondent of ''[[Cahiers du cinéma]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Krohn, after investigating several script revisions, notes to other production personnel written by or to Hitchcock alongside inspection of storyboards, and other production material, has observed that Hitchcock's work often deviated from how the screenplay was written or how the film was originally envisioned</span>
				<span class='text'>He noted that the myth of storyboards in relation to Hitchcock, often regurgitated by generations of commentators on his movies, was to a great degree perpetuated by Hitchcock himself or the publicity arm of the studios</span>
				<span class='text'>A great example would be the celebrated crop-spraying sequence of ''North by Northwest'' which was not storyboarded at all</span>
				<span class='text'>After the scene was filmed, the publicity department asked Hitchcock to make storyboards to promote the film and Hitchcock in turn hired an artist to match the scenes in detail</span>
				<span class='text'>ven when storyboards were made, scenes that were shot differed from them significantly</span>
				<span class='text'>Krohn's extensive analysis of the production of Hitchcock classics like ''Notorious'' reveals that Hitchcock was flexible enough to change a film's conception during its production</span>
				<span class='text'>Another example Krohn notes is the American remake of ''The Man Who Knew Too Much,'' whose shooting schedule commenced without a finished script and moreover went over schedule, something that, as Krohn notes, was not an uncommon occurrence on many of Hitchcock's films, including ''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]'' and ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>While Hitchcock did do a great deal of preparation for all his movies, he was fully cognizant that the actual film-making process often deviated from the best-laid plans and was flexible to adapt to the changes and needs of production as his films were not free from the normal hassles faced and common routines utilised during many other film productions</span>
				<span class='text'>rohn's work also sheds light on Hitchcock's practice of generally shooting in chronological order, which he notes sent many films over budget and over schedule and, more importantly, differed from the standard operating procedure of Hollywood in the Studio System Era</span>
				<span class='text'>Equally important is Hitchcock's tendency to shoot alternate takes of scenes</span>
				<span class='text'>This differed from coverage in that the films were not necessarily shot from varying angles so as to give the editor options to shape the film how he/she chooses (often under the producer's aegis)</span>
				<span class='text'>Rather they represented Hitchcock's tendency of giving himself options in the editing room, where he would provide advice to his editors after viewing a rough cut of the work</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Krohn, this and a great deal of other information revealed through his research of Hitchcock's personal papers, script revisions and the like refute the notion of Hitchcock as a director who was always in control of his films, whose vision of his films did not change during production, which Krohn notes has remained the central long-standing myth of Alfred Hitchcock</span>
				<span class='text'>is fastidiousness and attention to detail also found its way into each [[film poster]] for his films</span>
				<span class='text'>Hitchcock preferred to work with the best talent of his day—film poster designers such as [[Bill Gold]] and [[Saul Bass]]—who would produce posters that accurately represented his films</span>

				<span class='text'>However, [[Michael Redgrave]] said that Hitchcock had made the statement during the filming of ''[[The Lady Vanishes (1938 film)|The Lady Vanishes]]'' (1938)</span>
				<span class='text'>Later, in America, during the filming of ''[[Mr</span>

				<span class='text'>210–211, 277; American Movie Classics&lt;/ref&gt;Much of Hitchcock's supposed dislike of actors has been exaggerated</span>
				<span class='text'>Hitchcock simply did not tolerate the [[Method acting|method]] approach, as he believed that actors should only concentrate on their performances and leave work on script and character to the directors and screenwriters</span>
				<span class='text'>In a ''[[Sight and Sound]]'' interview, he stated that, 'the method actor is OK in the theatre because he has a free space to move about</span>
				<span class='text'>But when it comes to cutting the face and what he sees and so forth, there must be some discipline'</span>

				<span class='text'>uring the making of ''Lifeboat'', [[Walter Slezak]], who played the German villain, stated that Hitchcock knew the mechanics of acting better than anyone he knew</span>
				<span class='text'>Several critics have observed that despite his reputation as a man who disliked actors, several actors who worked with him gave fine, often brilliant performances and these performances contribute to the film's success</span>
				<span class='text'>As more fully discussed above, in &quot;Inter-War British Career,&quot; actress [[Dolly Haas]], who was a personal friend of Hitchcock and who acted for him in the 1953 film ''[[I Confess (film)|I Confess]]'', stated that Hitchcock regarded actors as &quot;animated props</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;For Hitchcock, the actors, like the props, were part of the film's setting, as he said to Truffaut:&lt;blockquote&gt;In my opinion, the chief requisite for an actor is the ability to do nothing well, which is by no means as easy as it sounds</span>
				<span class='text'>He should be willing to be utilised and wholly integrated into the picture by the director and the camera</span>
				<span class='text'>He must allow the camera to determine the proper emphasis and the most effective dramatic highlights</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Truffaut|1984|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Regarding Hitchcock's sometimes less than pleasant relationship with actors, there was a persistent rumour that he had said that actors were cattle</span>
				<span class='text'>Hitchcock addressed this story in his interview with François Truffaut:&lt;blockquote&gt;I'm not quite sure in what context I might have made such a statement</span>
				<span class='text'>It may have been made </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>when we used actors who were simultaneously performing in stage plays</span>
				<span class='text'>When they had a matinee, and I suspected they were allowing themselves plenty of time for a very leisurely lunch</span>
				<span class='text'>And this meant that we had to shoot our scenes at breakneck speed so that the actors could get out on time</span>
				<span class='text'>I couldn't help feeling that if they'd been really conscientious, they'd have swallowed their sandwich in the cab, on the way to the theatre, and get there in time to put on their make-up and go on stage</span>
				<span class='text'>I had no use for that kind of actor</span>

				<span class='text'>140&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Truffaut|1984|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In the late 1950s, [[French New Wave]] critics, especially [[Éric Rohmer]], [[Claude Chabrol]] and [[François Truffaut]], were among the first to see and promote Hitchcock's films as artistic works</span>
				<span class='text'>Hitchcock was one of the first directors to whom they applied their [[auteur theory]], which stresses the artistic authority of the director in the film-making process</span>
				<span class='text'>itchcock's innovations and vision have influenced a great number of filmmakers, producers, and actors</span>
				<span class='text'>His influence helped start a trend for film directors to control artistic aspects of their movies without answering to the movie's producer</span>
				<span class='text'>=Inspiration for suspense and psychological thrillers==In a 1963 interview with Oriana Fallaci, Hitchcock was asked in spite of looking like a pleasant, innocuous man, he seemed to have fun making films which involve a lot of suspense and terrifying crime, to which he responded,{{quote|I'm English</span>
				<span class='text'>The English use a lot of imagination with their crimes</span>
				<span class='text'>I don't get such a kick out of anything as much as out of imagining a crime</span>
				<span class='text'>When I'm writing a story and I come to a crime, I think happily: now wouldn't it be nice to have him die like this? And then, even more happily, I think: at this point people will start yelling</span>

				<span class='text'>His [[irony]]-tinged voice and signature droll delivery, gallows humour, iconic image and mannerisms became instantly recognisable and were often the subject of parody</span>
				<span class='text'>he title-sequence of the show pictured a minimalist caricature of Hitchcock's profile (he drew it himself; it is composed of only nine strokes), which his real silhouette then filled</span>
				<span class='text'>His introductions before the stories in his program always included some sort of wry humour, such as the description of a recent multi-person execution hampered by having only one [[electric chair]], while two are now shown with a sign &quot;Two chairs—no waiting!&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He directed 18 episodes of the TV series himself, which aired from 1955 to 1965 in two versions</span>
				<span class='text'>It became ''[[The Alfred Hitchcock Hour]]'' in 1962</span>

				<span class='text'>The Three Investigators—Jupiter Jones, Bob Andrews and Peter Crenshaw—were amateur detectives, slightly younger than the [[Hardy Boys]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In the introduction to each book, &quot;Alfred Hitchcock&quot; introduces the mystery, and he sometimes refers a case to the boys to solve</span>
				<span class='text'>At the end of each book, the boys report to Hitchcock, and sometimes give him a memento of their case</span>
				<span class='text'>t the height of Hitchcock's success, he was also asked to introduce a set of books with his name attached</span>
				<span class='text'>The series was a collection of short stories by popular short-story writers, primarily focused on suspense and thrillers</span>
				<span class='text'>These titles included ''[[Alfred Hitchcock's Anthology]]'', ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents: Stories to be Read with the Door Locked'', ''Alfred Hitchcock's Monster Museum'', ''Alfred Hitchcock's Supernatural Tales of Terror and Suspense'', ''Alfred Hitchcock's Spellbinders in Suspense'', ''Alfred Hitchcock's Witch's Brew'', ''Alfred Hitchcock's Ghostly Gallery'', ''Alfred Hitchcock's A Hangman's Dozen'', ''Alfred Hitchcock's Stories Not For the Nervous'' and ''Alfred Hitchcock's Haunted Houseful</span>
				<span class='text'>' Hitchcock himself was not actually involved in the reading, reviewing, editing or selection of the short stories; in fact, even his introductions were ghost-written</span>
				<span class='text'>The entire extent of his involvement with the project was to lend his name and collect a cheque</span>

				<span class='text'>In a similar manner, Hitchcock's name was licensed for a digest-sized monthly, ''[[Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine]]'', which has been published since 1956</span>
				<span class='text'>itchcock also wrote a mystery story for ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' magazine in 1943, &quot;The Murder of [[Monty Woolley]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>This was a sequence of captioned photographs inviting the reader to inspect the pictures for clues to the murderer's identity; Hitchcock cast the performers as themselves, such as Woolley, Doris Merrick and make-up man Guy Pearce, whom Hitchcock identified, in the last photo, as the murderer</span>
