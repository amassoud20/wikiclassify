				<span class='text'>First of the [[Ottonian Dynasty]] of German kings and emperors, he is generally considered to be the founder and first king of the medieval German state, known until then as [[East Francia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>An avid hunter, he obtained the epithet &quot;the Fowler&quot;&lt;ref&gt;A fowler is one who hunts [[wildfowl]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; because he was allegedly fixing his birding nets when messengers arrived to inform him that he was to be king</span>
				<span class='text'>=Family==Born in [[Memleben]], in what is now [[Saxony-Anhalt]], Henry was the son of [[Otto the Illustrious]], Duke of Saxony, and his wife [[Hedwiga]], daughter of [[Henry of Franconia]] and Ingeltrude and a great-great-granddaughter of [[Charlemagne]], or Charles I</span>
				<span class='text'>In 906 he married [[Hatheburg von Merseburg]], daughter of the Saxon count Erwin</span>
				<span class='text'>She had previously been a nun</span>
				<span class='text'>The marriage was annulled in 909 because her vows as a nun were deemed by the church to remain valid</span>
				<span class='text'>She had already given birth to Henry's son [[Thankmar]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The annulment placed a question mark over Thankmar's legitimacy</span>
				<span class='text'>Later that year he married [[Matilda of Ringelheim|Matilda]], daughter of [[Dietrich of Ringelheim|Dietrich]], Count in [[Westphalia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Matilda bore him three sons, one called [[Otto I|Otto]], and two daughters, [[Hedwig of Saxony|Hedwig]] and [[Gerberga of Saxony|Gerberga]], and founded many religious institutions, including the abbey of [[Quedlinburg Abbey|Quedlinburg]] where Henry is buried</span>
				<span class='text'>She was later [[canonization|canonized]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Succession==Henry became Duke of Saxony upon his father's death in 912</span>
				<span class='text'>An able ruler, he continued to strengthen the position of his duchy within the developing [[Kingdom of Germany]], frequently in conflict with his neighbors to the South, the dukes of [[Franconia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 23 December 918 [[Conrad I of Germany|Conrad I]], King of East Francia and Franconian duke, died</span>
				<span class='text'>Although they had been at odds with each other from 912&amp;ndash;15 over the title to lands in [[Thuringia]], before he died Conrad recommended Henry as his successor</span>
				<span class='text'>Conrad's choice was conveyed by Duke [[Eberhard III of Franconia|Eberhard of Franconia]], Conrad's brother and heir, at the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] of [[Fritzlar]] in 919</span>
				<span class='text'>The assembled Franconian and Saxon nobles duly elected Henry to be king</span>
				<span class='text'>Archbishop Heriger of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Mainz]] offered to anoint Henry according to the usual ceremony, but he refused to be anointed by a high church official &amp;mdash; the only King of his time not to undergo that rite &amp;mdash; allegedly because he wished to be king not by the church's but by the people's acclaim</span>
				<span class='text'>Duke [[Burchard II of Swabia]] soon swore fealty to the new King, but Duke [[Arnulf of Bavaria]] did not submit until Henry defeated him in two campaigns in 921</span>
				<span class='text'>Henry besieged his residence at Ratisbon ([[Regensburg]]) and forced Arnulf into submission</span>
				<span class='text'>n 920, the [[West Francia|West Frankish]] king [[Charles the Simple]] invaded Germany and marched as far as [[Pfeddersheim]] near [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], but he retired when he learned Henry was arming against him</span>

				<span class='text'>'p 180&lt;/ref&gt;  On 7 November 921, Henry and Charles met and concluded a treaty of friendship</span>
				<span class='text'>Henry then saw an opportunity to wrest the [[Lotharingia|Duchy of Lorraine]] from France when the French civil war began with the coronation of King [[Robert I of France|Robert I]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 923 Henry crossed the Rhine twice</span>
				<span class='text'>Later in the year he entered Lorraine with an army, capturing a large part of the duchy</span>
				<span class='text'>The eastern part of Lorraine was left in Henry's possession until October 924</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}==Reign==Henry regarded the German kingdom as a confederation of [[stem duchies]] rather than as a feudal monarchy and saw himself as ''[[primus inter pares]] (first among equals)''</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead of seeking to administer the empire through counts, as Charlemagne had done and as his successors had attempted, Henry allowed the dukes of Franconia, [[Swabia]], and [[History of Bavaria|Bavaria]] to maintain complete internal control of their holdings</span>
				<span class='text'>In 925, Duke [[Gilbert, Duke of Lorraine|Gilbert of Lorraine]] again rebelled</span>
				<span class='text'>Henry invaded the duchy and besieged Gilbert at [[Zülpich]] (Tolbiac), captured the town, and became master of a large portion of his lands</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus he brought that realm, which had been lost in 910, back into the German kingdom as the fifth stem duchy</span>
				<span class='text'>Allowing Gilbert to remain in power as duke, Henry arranged the marriage of his daughter Gerberga to his new vassal in 928</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Legend of the German crown offered to Henry, [[Hermann Vogel (German illustrator)|Hermann Vogel]] (1854–1921)]]Henry was an able military leader</span>
				<span class='text'>In 921 [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]] (Magyars) invaded Germany and Italy</span>

				<span class='text'>Germany from the Earliest Period&lt;/ref&gt; and another group was routed by [[Liutfried]], count of [[Elsass]] (French reading: [[Alsace]]), the Magyars repeatedly raided Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, Henry, having captured a Hungarian prince, managed to arrange a ten-year-truce in 926, though he was forced to pay tributes</span>
				<span class='text'>By doing so he and the German dukes gained time to fortify towns and train a new elite cavalry force</span>

				<span class='text'>In the winter of 928, he marched against the Slavic [[Hevelli]] tribes and seized their capital, [[Brandenburg an der Havel|Brandenburg]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He then invaded the [[Glomacze]] lands on the middle [[Elbe]] river, conquering the capital Gana (Jahna) after a siege, and had a fortress (the later [[Albrechtsburg]]) built at [[Meissen]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 929, with the help of Arnulf of Bavaria, Henry entered [[Bohemia]] and forced Duke [[Wenceslaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Wenceslaus I]] to resume the yearly payment of tribute to the king</span>
				<span class='text'>Meanwhile, the Slavic [[Veleti|Redarii]] had driven away their chief, captured the town of [[Walsleben, Saxony-Anhalt|Walsleben]], and massacred the inhabitants</span>
				<span class='text'>Counts Bernard and Thietmar marched against the fortress of [[Lenzen]] beyond the Elbe, and, after fierce fighting, completely routed the enemy on 4 September 929</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Germans|Lusatians]] and the [[Ukrani]] on the lower [[Oder]] were subdued and made tributary in 932 and 934, respectively</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Henry left no consistent [[March (territory)|march]] administration, which was implemented by his successor Otto I</span>
				<span class='text'>n 932 Henry finally refused to pay the regular tribute to the Magyars</span>
				<span class='text'>When they began raiding again, he led a unified army of all German duchies to victory at the [[Battle of Riade]] in 933 near the river Unstrut, thus stopping the Magyar advance into Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>He also pacified territories to the north, where the [[Denmark|Danes]] had been harrying the [[Frisians]] by sea</span>
