				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|A Leo III base gold solidus, minted in [[Rome]]</span>
				<span class='text'>]===Early life===Leo, whose original name was '''Konon''', was born in Germanikeia in the Syrian province of [[Commagene]] (modern [[Kahramanmaraş]] in Turkey)</span>
				<span class='text'>Some, including the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] chronicler [[Theophanes the Confessor|Theophanes]], have claimed that Konon's family had been resettled in [[Thrace]], where he entered the service of Emperor [[Justinian II]], when the latter was advancing on [[Constantinople]] with an army of 100,000 horsemen provided by [[Tervel of Bulgaria]] in 705</span>
				<span class='text'>fter the victory of Justinian II, Konon was dispatched on a diplomatic mission to [[Alania]] and [[Lazica]] to organize an alliance against the [[Umayyad]] [[Caliph]]ate under [[Al-Walid I]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Konon was appointed commander ([[strategos|''stratēgos'']]) of the [[Anatolic Theme|Anatolic theme]] by Emperor [[Anastasios II (emperor)|Anastasius II]]</span>
				<span class='text'> On his deposition, Konon joined with his colleague [[Artabasdos|Artabasdus]], the ''stratēgos'' of the [[Armeniac Theme|Armeniac theme]], in conspiring to overthrow the new Emperor Theodosius III</span>
				<span class='text'>Artabasdus was betrothed to [[Anna, wife of Artabasdos|Anna]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last =Treadgold  | first =Warren  | title =A History of the Byzantine State and Society  | publisher = University of Stanford Press  | year = 1997  | location = Stanford  | page =346  | isbn =0-8047-2630-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;daughter of Leo as part of the agreement</span>
				<span class='text'>==Siege of Constantinople==={{main|Siege of Constantinople (717–718)}}Leo entered Constantinople on 25 March 717 and forced the abdication of Theodosios III, becoming emperor as Leo III</span>
				<span class='text'>The new Emperor was immediately forced to attend to the [[Siege of Constantinople (717–18)|Second Arab siege of Constantinople]], which commenced in August of the same year</span>
				<span class='text'>The Arabs were Umayyad forces sent by Caliph [[Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik]] and serving under his brother [[Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik]]</span>
				<span class='text'>They had taken advantage of the civil discord in the Byzantine Empire to bring a force of 80,000 to 150,000 men and a massive fleet to the [[Bosphorus]]</span>

				<span class='text'>109–133</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Careful preparations, begun three years earlier under Anastasius II, and the stubborn resistance put up by Leo wore out the invaders</span>
				<span class='text'>An important factor in the victory of the Byzantines was their use of [[Greek fire]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Treadgold</span>
				<span class='text'>''History of the Byzantine State'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>347</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The Arab forces also fell victim to Bulgarian reinforcements arriving to aid the Byzantines</span>
				<span class='text'>Leo was allied with the Bulgarians but the chronicler [[Theophanes the Confessor]] was uncertain if they were still serving under Tervel or his eventual successor [[Kormesiy of Bulgaria]]</span>
				<span class='text'>nable to continue the siege in the face of the Bulgarian onslaught, the impenetrability of Constantinople's walls, and their own exhausted provisions, the Arabs were forced to abandon the siege in August, 718</span>
				<span class='text'>Sulayman himself had died the previous year and his successor [[Umar II]] would not attempt another siege</span>
				<span class='text'>The siege had lasted 12 months</span>
				<span class='text'>==Administration===Having thus preserved the Empire from extinction, Leo proceeded to consolidate its administration, which in the previous years of anarchy had become completely disorganized</span>
				<span class='text'>In 718 he suppressed a rebellion in [[Sicily]] and in 719 did the same on behalf of the deposed Emperor [[Anastasios II (emperor)|Anastasios II]]</span>
				<span class='text'>eo secured the Empire's frontiers by inviting [[Slavs|Slavic]] settlers into the depopulated districts and by restoring the [[Byzantine military|army]] to efficiency; when the Umayyad Caliphate renewed their invasions in 726 and 739, as part of the campaigns of [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik]], the Arab forces were decisively beaten, particularly at [[Battle of Akroinon|Akroinon]] in 740</span>
				<span class='text'>His military efforts were supplemented by his alliances with the [[Khazars]] and the [[Georgians]]</span>
				<span class='text'>eo undertook a set of civil reforms including the abolition of the system of prepaying taxes which had weighed heavily upon the wealthier proprietors, the elevation of the [[serf]]s into a [[social class|class]] of free [[Tenant farmer|tenant]]s and the remodelling of [[Family law|family]], [[maritime law]] and [[criminal law]], notably substituting [[mutilation]] for the [[death penalty]] in many cases</span>
				<span class='text'>The new measures, which were embodied in a new [[Legal code|code]] called the ''[[Ecloga]]'' (''Selection''), published in 726, met with some opposition on the part of the nobles and higher clergy</span>
				<span class='text'>The Emperor also undertook some reorganization of the [[Theme (country subdivision)|theme]] structure by creating new themata in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] region</span>
				<span class='text'>==Iconoclasm===Leo's most striking legislative reforms dealt with religious matters, especially [[iconoclasm]] (&quot;Icon-breaking,&quot; therefore an iconoclast is an &quot;Icon-breaker&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ladner, Gerhart</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Origin and Significance of the Byzantine Iconoclastic Controversy</span>

				<span class='text'>127–149</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; After an apparently successful attempt to enforce the [[baptism]] of all [[Jew]]s and [[Montanism|Montanists]] in the empire (722), he issued a [[Byzantine Iconoclasm|series of edicts]] against the worship of images (726–729)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Treadgold</span>
				<span class='text'>''History of the Byzantine State'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>350, 352–353</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This prohibition of a custom which had been in use for centuries seems to have been inspired by a genuine desire to improve public morality, and received the support of the official aristocracy and a section of the clergy</span>
				<span class='text'>A majority of the theologians and all the monks opposed these measures with uncompromising hostility, and in the western parts of the Empire the people refused to obey the edict</span>
				<span class='text'> revolt which broke out in Greece, mainly on religious grounds, was crushed by the imperial fleet in 727 (cf</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Agallianos Kontoskeles]])</span>
				<span class='text'>In 730, [[Patriarch Germanos I of Constantinople]] resigned rather than subscribe to an iconoclastic decree</span>
				<span class='text'>Leo had him replaced by [[Patriarch Anastasius of Constantinople|Anastasios]],&lt;ref&gt;Treadgold</span>
				<span class='text'>''History of the Byzantine State'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>353</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; who willingly sided with the Emperor on the question of icons</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus Leo suppressed the overt opposition of the capital</span>
				<span class='text'>n the [[Italian Peninsula]], the defiant attitude of Popes [[Pope Gregory II|Gregory II]] and [[Pope Gregory III|Gregory III]] on behalf of image-veneration led to a fierce quarrel with the Emperor</span>
				<span class='text'>The former summoned councils in [[Rome]] to anathematize and excommunicate the iconoclasts (730, 732); In 740 Leo retaliated by transferring [[Southern Italy]] and [[Illyria|Illyricum]] from the papal diocese to that of the [[Patriarch of Constantinople]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Treadgold</span>
				<span class='text'>''History of the Byzantine State'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>354–355</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The struggle was accompanied by an armed outbreak in the [[exarchate of Ravenna]] in 727, which Leo finally endeavoured to subdue by means of a large fleet</span>
				<span class='text'>But the destruction of the armament by a storm decided the issue against him; his southern Italian subjects successfully defied his religious edicts, and the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]] became effectively detached from the Empire</span>
				<span class='text'>he emperor died of [[dropsy]] in June 741</span>
