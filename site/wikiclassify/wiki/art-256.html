				<span class='text'>om/books?id=fFoWA4cLOisC&amp;pg=PA17]&lt;/ref&gt;The exact relationship between the Book of Isaiah and any such historical Isaiah is complicated</span>
				<span class='text'>{efn|See the article ''[[Book of Isaiah]]'' for an extended overview of theories of its composition</span>
				<span class='text'>} One widespread view sees parts of the first half of the book (chapters 1–39) as originating with the historical prophet, interspersed with prose commentaries written in the time of King [[Josiah]] a hundred years later; with the remainder of the book dating from immediately before and immediately after the end of the [[Babylonian captivity|exile in Babylon]], almost two centuries after the time of the original prophet</span>
				<span class='text'>[Jews]] and [[Christian]]s consider the [[Book of Isaiah]] a part of their [[Biblical canon]]; he is the first listed (although not the earliest) of the ''[[Nevi'im|Nevi'im Aharonim]]'', the latter prophets</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''JPS Hebrew English Tanakh'', Jewish Publication Society, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims consider Isaiah a prophet mentioned in [[tafsir|Muslim exegesis]] of canonical scriptures</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|[[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian]] [[icon]] of the Prophet Isaiah, 18th century ([[iconostasis]] of [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]] Church, [[Kizhi]] monastery, [[Karelia]], [[Russia]])</span>

				<span class='text'>IF|thumb|left|Representation of the Prophet Isaiah illustrating a 14th-century prose translation of the Gospels]]The first verse of the Book of Isaiah states that Isaiah prophesied during the reigns of [[Uzziah]] (or Azariah), [[Jotham of Judah|Jotham]], [[Ahaz]], and [[Hezekiah]], the kings of [[kingdom of Judah|Judah]] ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|1:1|HE}})</span>
				<span class='text'>Uzziah's reign was 52 years in the middle of the 8th century BCE, and Isaiah must have begun his ministry a few years before Uzziah's death, probably in the [[740s BCE]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Isaiah lived until the fourteenth year of Hezekiah's reign (who died [[690s BCE|698 BCE]]), and may have been contemporary for some years with [[Manasseh of Judah|Manasseh]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus Isaiah may have prophesied for as long as 64 years</span>
				<span class='text'>saiah's wife was called &quot;the prophetess&quot; ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|8:3|HE}}), either because she was endowed with the prophetic gift, like Deborah ({{bibleverse||Judges|4:4|HE}}) and Huldah ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|22:14–20|HE}}), or simply because she was the &quot;wife of the prophet&quot; (as he is named, for instance in {{bibleverse||Isaiah|38:1|HE}})</span>
				<span class='text'>The second interpretation, that it was simply an honorary title is likely</span>

				<span class='text'>''A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament'', Oxford University Press, 2009, p</span>
				<span class='text'>73</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; They had two sons, naming one She'ar-Ya'shuv, meaning &quot;A remnant shall return&quot; ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|7:3|HE}}) and the younger, [[Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz]], meaning, &quot;Spoil quickly, plunder speedily</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|8:3|HE}}) The book of Isaiah, along with the book of Jeremiah, is distinctive in the Hebrew bible for its direct portrayal of the &quot;wrath of the Lord&quot; as presented, for example, in Isaiah 9:19 stating, &quot;Through the wrath of the Lord of hosts is the land darkened, and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah 9:19</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In early youth, Isaiah may have been moved by the invasion of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] by the [[Assyria]]n monarch [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|15:19|HE}}); and again, twenty years later, when he had already entered his office, by the invasion of Tiglath-Pileser and his career of conquest</span>
				<span class='text'>Ahaz, king of Judah, at this crisis refused to co-operate with the kings of Israel and [[Syria]] in opposition to the Assyrians, and was on that account attacked and defeated by [[Rezin]] of [[Damascus]] and [[Pekah]] of Israel ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|16:5|HE}}; {{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|28:5–6|HE}})</span>
				<span class='text'>Humbled, Ahaz sided with [[Assyria]] and sought the aid of Tiglath-Pileser against Israel and Syria</span>
				<span class='text'>The consequence was that Rezin and Pekah were conquered and many of the people carried captive to Assyria ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|15:29|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb|2|Kings|16:9|HE}}; {{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|5:26|HE}})</span>

				<span class='text'>Matthew's German Evangelical Lutheran Church]] in Charleston, South Carolina]]Soon after this, [[Shalmaneser V]] determined to subdue the kingdom of Israel, [[Samaria]] was taken and destroyed ([[720s BCE|722 BCE]])</span>
				<span class='text'>So long as Ahaz reigned, the kingdom of Judah was unmolested by the Assyrian power; but on his accession to the throne, Hezekiah, who was encouraged to rebel &quot;against the king of Assyria&quot; ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|18:7|HE}}), entered into an alliance with the king of [[Egypt]] ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|30:2–4|HE}})</span>
				<span class='text'>This led the king of Assyria to threaten the king of Judah, and at length to invade the land</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Sennacherib]] ([[709–700 BC|701 BC]]) led a powerful army into Judah</span>
				<span class='text'>Hezekiah was reduced to despair, and submitted to the Assyrians ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|18:14–16|HE}})</span>
				<span class='text'>But after a brief interval war broke out again</span>
				<span class='text'>Again Sennacherib led an army into Judah, one detachment of which threatened Jerusalem ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|36:2–22|HE}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Isaiah|37:8|HE}})</span>
				<span class='text'>Isaiah on that occasion encouraged Hezekiah to resist the Assyrians ({{bibleverse-nb||Isaiah|37:1–7|HE}}), whereupon Sennacherib sent a threatening letter to Hezekiah, which he &quot;spread before the LORD&quot; ({{bibleverse-nb||Isaiah|37:14|HE}})</span>
				<span class='text'>{quote|Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying: &quot;Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: Whereas thou hast prayed to Me against Sennacherib king of Assyria,this is the word which the LORD hath spoken concerning him: The virgin daughter of Zion hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee</span>
				<span class='text'>hom hast thou taunted and blasphemed? And against whom hast thou exalted thy voice? Yea, thou hast lifted up thine eyes on high, even against the Holy One of Israel!&quot; ({{bibleverse-nb||Isaiah|37:21–23|HE}})}}According to the account in 2 Kings 19 (and its derivative account in 2 Chronicles 32) the judgment of God now fell on the Assyrian army and wiped out 185,000 of its men</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Like [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] in Greece, Sennacherib never recovered from the shock of the disaster in Judah</span>
				<span class='text'>He made no more expeditions against either the Southern Levant or Egypt</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The remaining years of Hezekiah's reign were peaceful ({{bibleverse|2|Chr|32:23–29|HE}})</span>
				<span class='text'>Isaiah probably lived to its close, and possibly into the reign of [[Manasseh of Judah|Manasseh]], but the time and manner of his death are not specified in either the [[Bible]] or other primary sources</span>
				<span class='text'>There is a tradition in Rabbinic literature that he suffered martyrdom by being [[Death by sawing|sawn in two]] under the orders of Manasseh</span>
