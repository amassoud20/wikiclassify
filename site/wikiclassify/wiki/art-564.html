				<span class='text'>A self-proclaimed [[Populism|populist]], Hearst went on to publish stories of municipal and financial corruption, often attacking companies in which his own family held an interest</span>
				<span class='text'>Within a few years, his paper dominated the San Francisco market</span>
				<span class='text'>= ''New York Morning Journal'' ==Early in his career at the ''San Francisco Examiner,'' Hearst envisioned running a large newspaper chain, and &quot;always knew that his dream of a nation-spanning, multi-paper news operation was impossible without a triumph in New York</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whyte|2009|p=463}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895, with the financial support of his mother, he bought the failing ''[[New York Morning Journal]],'' hiring writers like [[Stephen Crane]] and [[Julian Hawthorne]] and entering into a head-to-head circulation war with [[Joseph Pulitzer]], owner and publisher of the ''[[New York World]],'' from whom he &quot;stole&quot; [[Richard F</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;When Hearst purchased the &quot;penny paper,&quot; so called because its copies sold for only a penny apiece, the ''Journal'' was competing with New York's 16 other major dailies, with a strong focus on Democratic Party politics</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whyte|2009|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hearst imported his best managers from the ''San Francisco Examiner'' and &quot;quickly established himself as the most attractive employer&quot; among New York newspapers</span>
				<span class='text'>He was generous, paid more than his competitors, gave credit to his writers with page-one bylines, and was unfailingly polite, unassuming, &quot;impeccably calm,&quot; and indulgent of &quot;prima donnas, eccentrics, bohemians, drunks, or reprobates so long as they had useful talents</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whyte|2009|pp=116–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;Hearst's activist approach to journalism can be summarized by the motto, &quot;While others Talk, the ''Journal'' Acts</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;=== Yellow Journalism and rivalry with the New York ''World'' ===[[File:Hearst Vignola &amp; Brisbane 1920</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumbnail|From left to right: Hearst, [[Robert Vignola]] and Arthur Brisbane in New York, during the filming of Vignola's ''[[The World and His Wife]]'' (1920)]]The New York ''Journal'' and its chief rival, the New York ''World,'' mastered a style of popular journalism that came to be derided as &quot;[[Yellow Journalism]],&quot; after Outcault's [[Yellow Kid]] comic</span>
				<span class='text'>Pulitzer's ''World'' had pushed the boundaries of mass appeal for newspapers through bold headlines, aggressive news gathering, generous use of cartoons and illustrations, populist politics, progressive crusades, an exuberant public spirit, and dramatic crime and human-interest stories</span>
				<span class='text'>Hearst's ''Journal'' used the same recipe for success, forcing Pulitzer to drop the price of the ''World'' from 2 cents to a penny</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon the two papers were locked in a fierce, often spiteful competition for readers in which both papers would spend large sums of money and see huge gains in circulation</span>
				<span class='text'>ithin a few months of purchasing the ''Journal,'' Hearst would hire away Pulitzer's three top editors: Sunday editor Morrill Goddard, who greatly expanded the scope and appeal of the American Sunday newspaper, Solomon Carvalho, and a young [[Arthur Brisbane]], who would become managing editor of the Hearst newspaper empire, and a legendary columnist</span>
				<span class='text'>Contrary to popular assumption, they were not lured away by higher pay—rather, each man had grown tired of both the temperamental, domineering Pulitzer and the paranoid, back-biting office politics which he encouraged</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whyte|2009|pp=100–106, 110–111, 346–348}}&lt;/ref&gt;While Hearst's many critics attribute the ''Journal's'' incredible success to cheap sensationalism, as Kenneth Whyte noted in ''The Uncrowned King: The Sensational Rise Of William Randolph Hearst,'' &quot;The ''Journal'' was a demanding, sophisticated paper by contemporary standards</span>
				<span class='text'>Rather than racing to the bottom, he [Hearst] drove the ''Journal'' and the penny press upmarket</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whyte|2009|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though yellow journalism would be much maligned, &quot;All good yellow journalists </span>
				<span class='text'></span>

				<span class='text'>They wore their feelings on their pages, believing it was an honest and wholesome way to communicate with readers</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; But, as Whyte pointed out, &quot;This appeal to feelings is not an end in itself</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>they believed] our emotions tend to ignite our intellects: a story catering to a reader's feelings is more likely than a dry treatise to stimulate thought</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whyte|2009|p=314}}&lt;/ref&gt;The two papers would finally declare a truce in late 1898, after both papers lost vast amounts of money covering the [[Spanish–American War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Indeed, Hearst probably lost several million dollars in his first three years as publisher of the ''Journal''</span>
				<span class='text'>(Actual figures are impossible to verify</span>

				<span class='text'>Their coverage of that historic election was probably the most important of any newspaper in the country, exposing both the unprecedented role of money in the Republican campaign and the dominating role played by [[William McKinley]]'s political and financial manager, [[Mark Hanna]], the first national party 'boss' in American history</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whyte|2009|pp=164–65,178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only a year after taking over the paper, Hearst could boast that sales of the ''Journal's'' post-election issue (including the Evening and German-language editions) topped 1</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whyte|2009|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;The ''Journal's'' political coverage, however, was not entirely one-sided</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;time1937&quot; /&gt;William Hearst’s outlook from the 1930s was ultra-conservative, nationalist and anti-communist</span>
				<span class='text'> His politics were the politics of the extreme right</span>
				<span class='text'> In 1934 he travelled to Germany, where he was received by Hitler as a guest and friend</span>
				<span class='text'> After this trip, Hearst’s newspapers became even more reactionary, always carrying articles against socialism, against the Soviet Union and especially against Stalin</span>
				<span class='text'> Hearst also tried to use his newspapers for overt Nazi propaganda purposes, publishing a series of articles by Goering, Hitler’s right-hand man</span>
				<span class='text'> After his visit to Hitler, Hearst’s sensationalist newspapers were filled with ‘revelations’ about the terrible happenings in the Soviet Union – murders, genocide, slavery, luxury for the rulers and starvation for the people; all these were the big news items almost every day</span>
				<span class='text'>The material was provided to Hearst by the [[Gestapo]], Nazi Germany’s political police</span>

				<span class='text'>Indeed, the ''Journal'' and other New York newspapers were so one-sided and full of errors in their reporting that coverage of the Cuban crisis and the ensuing Spanish–American War is often cited as one of the most significant milestones in the rise of [[yellow journalism]]'s hold over the mainstream media</span>

				<span class='text'>Hearst's support for [[Franklin D</span>
				<span class='text'>Roosevelt]] at the 1932 Democratic National Convention, via his allies [[William Gibbs McAdoo]] and [[John Nance Garner]], can also be seen as part of his vendetta against Smith, who was an opponent of Roosevelt's at that convention</span>

				<span class='text'>Most notable in his collection were his Greek vases, Spanish and Italian furniture, Oriental carpets, Renaissance vestments, an extensive library with many books signed by their authors, and paintings and statues from all over</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition to collecting pieces of fine art, he also gathered manuscripts, rare books, and autographs</span>

				<span class='text'>tm}}&lt;/ref&gt;His house was often visited by varied celebrities and politicians as guests who stayed in rooms furnished with pieces of antique furniture and decorated with artwork by several famous artists</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Seely /&gt;Beginning in 1937, Hearst began selling some of his art collection to help relieve the burden he had suffered from the depression</span>
				<span class='text'>The first year he sold 11 million dollars worth</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1941 he put about 20,000 items up for sale that were a good indication of his wide and varied tastes</span>
				<span class='text'>Included in the items he put up for sale were paintings by van Dyke, crosiers, chalices, Charles Dickens's [[sideboard]], pulpits, stained glass, arms and armor, George Washington's waistcoat, and Thomas Jefferson's Bible</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite the magnitude of these sales, when Hearst Castle was finally given to the State of California there were still enough items for the whole house to be considered as a museum</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Seely /&gt;=== St</span>
				<span class='text'>Donat's Castle ===After seeing photographs of [[St Donat's Castle|St</span>
				<span class='text'>Donat's Castle]] in ''[[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]] Magazine,'' Hearst bought the Welsh [[Vale of Glamorgan]] property and revitalized it in 1925 as a love gift to Davies</span>

				<span class='text'>The Great Hall was bought from the [[Bradenstoke Priory]] in Wiltshire and reconstructed brick by brick in its current site at St</span>
				<span class='text'>Donat's Castle</span>
				<span class='text'>The road haulage work was carried out by freight brokers Holme &amp; Simpson, later North British Transport Ltd</span>
				<span class='text'>From the Bradenstoke Priory he also bought and removed the guest house, Prior's lodging, and great tithe barn; of these, some of the materials became the St</span>
				<span class='text'>Donat's banqueting hall, complete with a sixteenth-century French chimney-piece and windows; also used were a fireplace dated to c</span>
				<span class='text'>1514 and a fourteenth-century roof, which became part of the Bradenstoke Hall, despite this use being questioned in Parliament</span>
				<span class='text'>Hearst built 34 green and white marble bathrooms for the many guest suites in the castle, and completed a series of terraced gardens which survive intact today</span>
				<span class='text'>Hearst and Davies spent much of their time entertaining and held a number of lavish parties, the guests at which included [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Douglas Fairbanks]], [[Winston Churchill]], and a young [[John F</span>
				<span class='text'>Kennedy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon visiting St</span>
				<span class='text'>Donat's, [[George Bernard Shaw]] was quoted as saying: &quot;This is what God would have built if he had had the money</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; When Hearst died, the castle was bought and is still owned and used by [[Atlantic College]], an international boarding school</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=April 2014}}=== The Family Club ===Once a decorated member of the [[Bohemian Club]], Hearst formed his own private club, [[The Family (club)|The Family]], after being ejected by the Bohemian Club</span>

				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=April 2014}}=== Death and legacy ===In 1947, Hearst left his San Simeon estate to seek medical care, which was unavailable in the remote location</span>
				<span class='text'>He died in Beverly Hills on August 14, 1951, at the age of 88</span>
				<span class='text'>He was interred in the Hearst family mausoleum at the Cypress Lawn Cemetery in Colma, California</span>
				<span class='text'>Like their father, none of Hearst's five sons succeeded in graduating from college,&lt;ref name=Nasaw2&gt;{{cite book|last=Nasaw|first=David|title=The Chief The Life of William Randolph Hearst|year=2000|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-395-82759-0|pages=357–358}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they all followed their father into the media business, and Hearst's namesake, William Randolph, Jr</span>
				<span class='text'> became a [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning newspaper reporter</span>
				<span class='text'>= Criticism ==As Martin Lee and Norman Solomon noted in their 1990 book ''Unreliable Sources,'' Hearst &quot;routinely invented sensational stories, faked interviews, ran phony pictures and distorted real events</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; This approach came to be known as &quot;[[yellow journalism]],&quot; so named after [[The Yellow Kid]], a character in the ''New York World's'' color [[comic strip]] ''Hogan's Alley</span>
				<span class='text'>'Hearst's use of [[yellow journalism]] techniques in his ''New York Journal'' to whip up popular support for U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>military adventurism in Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines in 1898 was also criticized in [[Upton Sinclair]]'s 1919 book, ''[[The Brass Check]]: A Study of American Journalism</span>
				<span class='text'>' According to Sinclair, Hearst's newspaper employees were &quot;willing by deliberate and shameful lies, made out of whole cloth, to stir nations to enmity and drive them to murderous war</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Sinclair also asserted that in the early 20th century Hearst's newspapers lied &quot;remorselessly about radicals,&quot; excluded &quot;the word Socialist from their columns&quot; and obeyed &quot;a standing order in all Hearst offices that American Socialism shall never be mentioned favorably</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; In addition, Sinclair charged that Hearst's &quot;Universal News Bureau&quot; re-wrote the news of the London morning papers in the Hearst office in New York and then fraudulently sent it out to American afternoon newspapers under the by-lines of imaginary names of non-existent &quot;Hearst correspondents&quot; in London, Paris, Venice, Rome, Berlin, etc</span>
				<span class='text'>Another critic, [[Ferdinand Lundberg]], extended the criticism in ''Imperial Hearst'' (1936), charging that Hearst papers accepted payments from abroad to slant the news</span>
				<span class='text'>After the war, a further critic, [[George Seldes]], repeated the charges in ''Facts and Fascism'' (1947)</span>
				<span class='text'>Also, biographer [[A</span>
				<span class='text'>Scott Berg]] notes that in the late 1920s [[Charles Lindbergh]] refused Hearst's very generous offer to sponsor him in a motion-picture career, in part because the famous aviator had little respect for the content and tone of Hearst's publications</span>

				<span class='text'>Morgan]] and the [[Vanderbilts]] in public, in private Hearst entered into partnership with them in lucrative ventures such as the [[Cerro de Pasco]] mines in Peru</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Brechin 1999&quot; /&gt;== In fiction ===== ''Citizen Kane'' ===''[[Citizen Kane]]'' is one of the most influential films of all time and is loosely based on Hearst's life</span>
				<span class='text'>Welles and co-writer [[Herman J</span>
				<span class='text'>Mankiewicz]] created Kane as a [[composite character]] of multiple men, among them [[Harold McCormick]], [[Samuel Insull]] and [[Howard Hughes]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Hearst, enraged at the idea of ''Citizen Kane'' being a thinly disguised and very unflattering portrait of him, used his massive influence and resources in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent the film from being released—all without his ever even having seen it</span>
				<span class='text'>Welles and the studio [[RKO Pictures]] resisted the pressure, but Hearst and his Hollywood friends ultimately succeeded in pressuring theater chains to limit showings of ''Citizen Kane,''&lt;ref&gt;Howard, James</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; resulting in mediocre box-office numbers and seriously harming Welles's career</span>
				<span class='text'>early sixty years later, [[HBO]] offered a fictionalized version of Hearst's efforts in its 1999 original production ''[[RKO 281]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Hearst is portrayed in the film by [[James Cromwell]]</span>
