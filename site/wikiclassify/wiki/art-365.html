				<span class='text'>His uncle was mayor of Cabra for many years</span>

				<span class='text'>The couple fell madly in love and plotted to run away together</span>
				<span class='text'>Her father discovered their plans and forbade Josefina from ever seeing Cervantes again, perhaps because of the young man's poor prospects of ever rising from poverty—Miguel's own father was embargoed for debt</span>
				<span class='text'>The court records of the proceedings show a very poor household</span>

				<span class='text'>He was there for about a year before he saw active service</span>
				<span class='text'>In September 1571 Cervantes sailed on board the ''Marquesa'', part of the [[galley]] fleet of the [[Holy League (1571)|Holy League]] (a coalition of [[Pope Pius V]], Spain, the [[Republic of Venice]], the [[Republic of Genoa]], the [[Duchy of Savoy]], the [[Knights Hospitaller]] based in [[Malta]], and others, under the command of [[Philip II of Spain]]'s illegitimate half brother, [[John of Austria]]) that defeated the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] fleet on October 7 in the [[Battle of Lepanto]], in the [[Gulf of Patras]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Though taken down with fever, Cervantes refused to stay below, and asked to be allowed to take part in the battle, saying he would rather die for his God and his king than keep under cover</span>
				<span class='text'>He fought on board a vessel, and received 3 gunshot wounds&amp;nbsp;– 2 in the chest, and one which rendered his left arm useless</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''Journey to Parnassus'' he was to say that he &quot;had lost the movement of the left hand for the glory of the right&quot; (he was thinking of the success of the first part of ''Don Quixote'')</span>
				<span class='text'>Cervantes looked back on his conduct in the battle with pride: he believed he had taken part in an event that shaped the course of [[European history]]</span>

				<span class='text'>At the time he was living in Valladolid, then briefly the capital (1601–1606), and finishing ''Don Quixote'' Part One, he was presumably working in the banking industry, or a related occupation where his accounting skills could be put to use</span>
				<span class='text'>He was turned down for a position as secretary to [[Pedro Fernández de Castro y Andrade]], the Count of Lemos, although he did receive some type of pension from him, which permitted him to write full-time during his final years (about 1610 to 1616)</span>
				<span class='text'>His last known written words – the dedication to [[Persiles y Sigismunda]] – were written, he tells us, after having received [[Extreme Unction]]</span>

				<span class='text'>The intrusion of everyday speech into a literary context was acclaimed by the reading public</span>
				<span class='text'>The author stayed poor until January 1605, when the first part of ''Don Quixote'' appeared</span>

				<span class='text'> ''[[Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda]]'' (1617)</span>
				<span class='text'>''Persiles'', as it is commonly known, is the best evidence not only of the survival of [[Byzantine novel]] themes but also of the survival of forms and ideas of the Spanish novel of the second [[Renaissance]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In this work, published after the author's death, Cervantes relates the ideal love and unbelievable vicissitudes of a couple, who, starting from the Arctic regions, arrive in Rome, where they find a happy ending to their complicated adventure</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[La Galatea]]'', the [[pastoral]] romance, which Cervantes wrote in his youth, is an imitation of the ''[[Diana (pastoral romance)|Diana]]'' of [[Jorge de Montemor]] and bears an even closer resemblance to [[Gil Polo]]'s continuation of that romance</span>
				<span class='text'>Next to ''Don Quixote'' and the ''Novelas ejemplares'', it is particularly worthy of attention, as it manifests the poetic direction in which Cervantes moved at an early period of life</span>
				<span class='text'>==''Don Quixote'' {{anchor|Don Quixote}}==={{Main|Don Quixote}}[[File:Gustave Doré - Miguel de Cervantes - Don Quixote - Part 1 - Chapter 1 - Plate 1 &quot;A world of disorderly notions, picked out of his books, crowded into his imagination&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|[[Gustave Doré]]'s first (of about 370) illustrations for ''Don Quixote''</span>
				<span class='text'>]''Don Quixote'' (spelled &quot;Quijote&quot; in modern Spanish) is two separate volumes, now nearly always published as one, that cover the adventures of ''Don Quixote'', also known as the knight or man of [[La Mancha]], a hero who carries his enthusiasm and self-deception to unintentional and comic ends</span>
				<span class='text'>On one level, ''Don Quixote'' works as a [[satire]] of the romances of [[chivalry]], which, though still popular in Cervantes' time, had become an object of ridicule among more demanding critics</span>
				<span class='text'>The choice of a madman as hero also served a critical purpose, for it was &quot;the impression of ill-being or 'in-sanity,' rather than a finding of dementia or psychosis in clinical terms, that defined the madman for Cervantesand his contemporaries</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Indeed, the concept of madness was &quot;associated with physical or moral displacement, as may be seen in the literal and figurative sense of the adjectives ''eccentric'', ''extravagant'', ''deviant'', ''aberrant'', etc</span>

				<span class='text'> (2002): 1-23; quotations on 2-3</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The novel allows Cervantes to illuminate various aspects of human nature</span>
				<span class='text'>Because the novel, particularly the first part, was written in individually published sections, the composition includes several incongruities</span>
				<span class='text'>Cervantes pointed out some of these errors in the preface to the second part; but he disdained to correct them, because he conceived that they had been too severely condemned by his critics</span>
				<span class='text'>ervantes felt a passion for the vivid painting of character</span>
				<span class='text'>''Don Quixote'' is noble-minded, an enthusiastic admirer of everything good and great, yet having all these fine qualities accidentally blended with a relative kind of madness</span>
				<span class='text'>He is paired with a character of opposite qualities, [[Sancho Panza]], a man of low self-esteem, who is a compound of grossness and simplicity</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|left|thumb|upright|Statuettes of Don Quixote (left) and Sancho Panza (right)</span>
				<span class='text'>]''Don Quixote'' is cited as the first classic model of the modern romance or novel, and it has served as the prototype of the comic novel</span>
				<span class='text'>The humorous situations are mostly burlesque, and it includes satire</span>
				<span class='text'>''Don Quixote'' is one of the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'''s [[Great Books of the Western World]], while the Russian author [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] called it &quot;the ultimate and most sublime work of human thinking&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''A Writer's Diary'' (1873–1876)&lt;/ref&gt; It is in ''Don Quixote'' that Cervantes coined the popular phrase &quot;the proof of the pudding is in the eating&quot; (''por la muestra se conoce el paño''), which still sees heavy use in the shortened form of &quot;the proof is in the pudding&quot;, and &quot;who walks much and reads much, knows much and sees much&quot; (''quien anda mucho y lee mucho, sabe mucho y ve mucho'')</span>
				<span class='text'>==''Novelas ejemplares'' (Exemplary Novels)==={{main|Novelas ejemplares}}Cervantes intended they should be to Spanish nearly what the [[novella]]s of [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]] were to Italians</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Novelas&quot;&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'>The Spanish title of ''novelas'' is misleading</span>
				<span class='text'>In modern Spanish it means [[novels]], but Cervantes used it to mean the shorter Italian ''[[novella]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>See the [[Novel]] article for the terminological problem</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Some are anecdotes, some are romances in miniature, some are serious, some comic; they are written in a light, smooth, conversational style</span>
				<span class='text'>our novelas, though favorites in Cervantes' day, are perhaps of less interest today than the rest: ''El amante liberal'', ''La señora Cornelia'', ''Las dos doncellas'', and '' La española inglesa''</span>
				<span class='text'>The theme common to these is pairs of lovers (couples) separated by lamentable and complicated events; they are finally reunited and find the happiness they have longed for</span>
				<span class='text'>The heroines are all beautiful and of perfect behavior; they and their lovers are capable of the highest sacrifices; and they try to elevate themselves to the ideal of moral and aristocratic distinction which illuminates their lives</span>
				<span class='text'>n ''El amante liberal'', the beautiful Leonisa and her lover Ricardo are carried off by Turkish pirates</span>
				<span class='text'>Both fight against serious material and moral dangers</span>
				<span class='text'>Ricardo conquers all obstacles, returns to his homeland with Leonisa, and is ready to renounce his passion and to hand her over to her former lover in an outburst of generosity; but Leonisa's preference naturally settles on Ricardo in the end</span>
				<span class='text'>nother group of &quot;exemplary&quot; novels is formed by ''La fuerza de la sangre'', ''La ilustre fregona'', ''La gitanilla'', and ''El celoso extremeño''</span>
				<span class='text'>The first three offer examples of love and adventure happily resolved, while the last unravels itself tragically</span>
				<span class='text'>Its plot deals with the old Felipe Carrizales, who, after traveling widely and becoming rich in America, decides to marry, taking all the precautions necessary to forestall being deceived</span>
				<span class='text'>He weds a very young girl{{spaced ndash}}and isolates her from the world, by having her live in a house with no windows facing the street</span>
				<span class='text'>But in spite of his defensive measures, a bold youth succeeds in penetrating the fortress of conjugal honour; and one day Carrizales surprises his wife in the arms of her seducer</span>
				<span class='text'>Surprisingly, he pardons the adulterers, recognizing that he is more to blame than they, and dies of sorrow over the grievous error he has committed</span>
				<span class='text'>Cervantes here deviated from literary tradition, which demanded the death of the adulterers; but he transformed the punishment inspired, or rather required, by the social ideal of [[honour]] into a statement on the responsibility of the individual</span>
				<span class='text'>'[[Novelas ejemplares|Rinconete y Cortadillo]]'', ''El casamiento engañoso'', ''El licenciado Vidriera'', and the untitled novella known today as ''El coloquio de los perros'', four works of art which are concerned more with the personalities of the characters than with the subject matter, form the final group of these stories</span>
				<span class='text'>The protagonists are, respectively, two young vagabonds, Rincón and Cortado, Lieutenant Campuzano, a student{{spaced ndash}}Tomás Rodaja (who goes mad and believes he has become glass, and who makes many remarks on society and customs of the time) and finally two dogs, Cipión and Berganza, whose wandering existence serves to mirror the most varied aspects of Spanish life</span>
				<span class='text'>''El coloquio de los perros'' features even more sardonic observations on the Spanish society of the time</span>
				<span class='text'>'Rinconete y Cortadillo'' is today considered one of the most delightful of Cervantes' works</span>
				<span class='text'>Its two young vagabonds come to Seville, attracted by the riches and disorder that the 16th-century commerce with the Americas had brought to that metropolis</span>
				<span class='text'>There they come into contact with a brotherhood of thieves, the [[Thieves' Guild]], led by Monipodio, whose house is the headquarters of the Sevillian underworld</span>
				<span class='text'>The solemn ritual of this band of ruffians is all the more comic for being presented in Cervantes' drily humorous style</span>

				<span class='text'>The latter is his most ambitious work in verse, an [[allegory]] which consists largely of reviews of contemporary poets</span>

				<span class='text'>==Plays===Comparisons to more famous playwrights, those that use more popular structures and have more authority over the world of theatre, have diminished the reputation of his plays; but two of them (''[[El Trato de Argel]]'' and ''[[La Numancia]]''{{spaced ndash}}1582) made an impact</span>
				<span class='text'>''El Trato de Argel'', is written in 5 acts; based on his experiences as a captive of the Moors, the play deals with the life of Christian slaves in Algiers</span>
				<span class='text'>''La Numancia'' is a description of the siege of Numantia by the Romans</span>
				<span class='text'>It details the horrors of the siege, and has been described as devoid of the requisites of dramatic art (he ignores structure and changes scheme and syllables per line many times throughout)</span>

				<span class='text'>ervantes invented, along with the subject of his piece, a peculiar style of tragic composition; and, in doing so, he did not pay much regard to the theory of Aristotle</span>
				<span class='text'>His object was to produce a piece full of tragic situations, combined with the charm of the marvellous</span>
				<span class='text'>In order to accomplish this goal, Cervantes relied heavily on allegory and on mythological elements</span>
				<span class='text'>he tragedy is written in conformity with no rules, save those which the author prescribed for himself, for he felt no inclination to imitate the Greek forms</span>
				<span class='text'>The play is divided into four acts, ''jornadas''; and no chorus is introduced</span>

				<span class='text'>He then faded into semi-obscurity</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The revival of interest in him was born in England in the eighteenth century, first by the deluxe edition of Tonson, for which the first biographical sketch was written (1738), and then by the scholarly editor [[John Bowle (writer)]], who was the first to call Cervantes a &quot;classic&quot; author</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=March 2015}} His influence on other novelists began in eighteenth-century England, and was followed by an intense interest by the German [[romantics]] in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries</span>
