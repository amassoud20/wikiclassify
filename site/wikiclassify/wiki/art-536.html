				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} After 18 months' military service in the [[Italian Army]], he left RAI in 1959 to become the senior non-fiction editor of the [[Bompiani]] publishing house in [[Milan]], a position he occupied until 1975</span>
				<span class='text'>Eco's work on medieval aesthetics stressed the distinction between theory and practice</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} About the Middle Ages, he wrote that there was &quot;a geometrically rational schema of what beauty ought to be, and on the other [hand] the unmediated life of art with its dialectic of forms and intentions&quot;, the two cut off from one another as if by a pane of glass</span>
				<span class='text'>Eco's work in literary theory has changed focus over time</span>
				<span class='text'>Initially, he was one of the pioneers of &quot;[[Reader-response criticism|Reader Response]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}===Literary criticism===Eco began seriously developing his ideas on the &quot;open&quot; text and on semiotics, writing many essays on these subjects, and in 1962 he published ''Opera aperta'' (translated into English as &quot;The Open Work&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>In it, Eco argued that literary texts are fields of meaning, rather than strings of meaning, that they are understood as open, internally dynamic and psychologically engaged fields</span>
				<span class='text'>Literature which limits one's potential understanding to a single, unequivocal line, the ''closed text'', remains the least rewarding, while texts that are the most active between mind, society and life ([[open text]]s) are the liveliest and best—although valuation terminology is not his primary focus</span>
				<span class='text'>Eco emphasizes  that words do not have meanings that are simply lexical, but rather, they operate in the context of utterance</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} [[I</span>
				<span class='text'>A</span>
				<span class='text'>Richards]] and others have made similar assertions, but Eco draws out the implications for literature from this idea</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} He also extended the axis of meaning from the continually deferred meanings of words in an utterance to a play between expectation and fulfilment of meaning</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Eco comes to these positions through study of language and from semiotics, rather than from psychology or historical analysis (as did theorists such as [[Wolfgang Iser]], on the one hand, and [[Hans-Robert Jauss]], on the other)</span>
				<span class='text'>==Studies on media culture===From the late '50s till the late '60s, before his semiotic turn, Eco engaged in studies on mass media and [[media culture]], which were published in various newspapers and journals</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Capozzi (2008)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|needed=yes|date=August 2012}} According to some{{Who|date=March 2011}} these studies were influential although he did not develop a full-scale theory in this field</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}His short 1961 essay ''[[Fenomenologia di Mike Bongiorno]]'' (''Phenomenology of Mike Bongiorno'', on the most popular [[quiz show]] host in Italy, [[Mike Bongiorno]]), received much notoriety among the general public and has drawn endless questions by journalists at every public appearance by Eco; the essay was later included in the collection ''Diario minimo'' (1963)</span>
				<span class='text'>His book ''Apocalittici e integrati'' (1964) analyzes the phenomenon of mass communication from a sociological perspective</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1967 he gave the influential&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Strangelove|first=Michael|date=2005|title=The Empire of Mind: Digital Piracy and the Anti-Capitalist Movement|publisher=University of Toronto Press|pages=104–5|isbn=0802038182}}&lt;/ref&gt; lecture ''Towards a Semiological Guerrilla Warfare'', which coined the influential term &quot;[[semiological guerrilla]],&quot; and influenced the theorization of guerrilla tactics against [[mainstream]] [[mass media culture]], such as [[guerrilla television]] and [[culture jamming]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Among the expressions used in the essay are &quot;communications guerrilla warfare&quot; and &quot;cultural guerrilla</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The essay was later included in Eco's book ''[[Faith in Fakes]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>==Semiotics===Eco founded and developed one of the most important approaches in contemporary semiotics, usually referred to as interpretative semiotics</span>
				<span class='text'>The main books in which he elaborates his theory are ''La struttura assente'' (1968; literally: ''The Absent Structure''), ''A Theory of Semiotics'' (1975), ''The Role of the Reader'' (1979), ''Semiotics and Philosophy of Language'' (1984), ''The Limits of Interpretation'' (1990) and ''[[Kant and the Platypus]]'' (1997)</span>
				<span class='text'>co co-founded ''[[Versus (journal)|Versus: Quaderni di studi semiotici]]'' (known as ''VS ''among Italian academics), an influential semiotic journal</span>
				<span class='text'>''VS'' has become an important publication platform for many scholars whose work is related to signs and signification</span>
				<span class='text'>The journal's foundation and activities have contributed to the growing influence of semiotics as an academic field in its own right, both in Italy and in the rest of Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>Most of the well-known European semioticians, including Eco, [[A</span>
				<span class='text'>J</span>
				<span class='text'>Greimas]], [[Jean-Marie Floch]], and [[Jacques Fontanille]], as well as philosophers and linguists like [[John Searle]] and [[George Lakoff]], have published original articles in ''VS''</span>

				<span class='text'>Eco developed this transcultural international network based on the idea of [[Alain le Pichon]] in West Africa</span>
				<span class='text'>The Bologna program resulted in a first conference in Guangzhou, China, in 1991 entitled &quot;Frontiers of Knowledge</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The first event was soon followed by an Itinerant Euro-Chinese seminar on &quot;Misunderstandings in the Quest for the Universal&quot; along the silk trade route from [[Guangzhou|Canton]] to Beijing</span>
				<span class='text'>The latter culminated in a book entitled ''The Unicorn and the Dragon'',&lt;ref&gt;''The Unicorn and the Dragon'', Le Pichon, Alain; Yue Dayun (eds</span>
				<span class='text'> (1996), Beijing University Press</span>
				<span class='text'>(bilingual French/English edition)&lt;/ref&gt; which discussed the question of the creation of knowledge in China and in Europe</span>

				<span class='text'>This in turn gave rise to a series of conferences in Brussels, Paris, and Goa, culminating in Beijing in 2007</span>
				<span class='text'>The topics of the Beijing conference were &quot;Order and Disorder&quot;,&quot;New Concepts of War and Peace&quot;, &quot;Human Rights&quot; and &quot;Social Justice and Harmony&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>=Style and works=====Themes===Eco's fiction has enjoyed a wide audience around the world, with many translations</span>

				<span class='text'>Franciscan friar [[William of Baskerville]], aided by his assistant Adso, a Benedictine novice, investigates a series of murders at a monastery that is to host an important religious debate</span>
				<span class='text'>The novel contains many direct or indirect [[metatextuality|metatextual]] references to other sources, requiring the detective work of the reader to 'solve'</span>
