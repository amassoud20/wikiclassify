				<span class='text'>The [[Suda]], a 10th-century [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] encyclopædia, dates her to the 42nd [[Olympiad]] (612/608 BCE), meaning either that she was born then or that this was her ''[[floruit]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>Cleïs is referred to in Fragment 132 with the Greek word ''pais'', which can as easily indicate a [[Slavery in antiquity|slave]] or any young person as an offspring</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell 1982 15&quot;&gt;{{harv|Campbell|1982|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;Sappho was reported to have three brothers: Erigyius (or Eurygius), Larichus and Charaxus</span>
				<span class='text'>The Oxyrhynchus papyrus indicates that Charaxus was the eldest, but that Sappho was more fond of the young Larichus</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Campbell|1982|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Athenaeus, Sappho often praised Larichus for pouring wine in the town hall of Mytilene, an office held by boys of the best families</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Campbell|1982|p=xi &amp; 189}}&lt;/ref&gt; This indication that Sappho was born into an aristocratic family is consistent with the sometimes rarefied environments that her verses record</span>
				<span class='text'> story recorded by [[Herodotus]], and later by Strabo, Athenaeus, [[Ovid]] and the Suda, tells of a relation between Charaxus and the Egyptian courtesan [[Rhodopis (hetaera)|Rhodopis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Herodotus, the oldest source of the story, reports that Charaxus ransomed Rhodopis for a large sum and that after he returned to Mitylene, Sappho scolded him in verse</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Campbell|1982|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strabo, writing some 400 years later, adds that Charaxus was trading with Lesbian wine and that Sappho called Rhodopis ''Doricha''</span>
				<span class='text'>Athenaeus, another 200 years later, calls the courtesan Doricha and maintains that Herodotus had her confused with Rhodopis, another woman altogether</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell 1982 15&quot;/&gt; He also cites an epigram by [[Posidippus]] (3rd century BCE) that refers to Doricha and Sappho</span>
				<span class='text'>Based on this story, scholars have speculated that references to a Doricha may have been found in Sappho's poems</span>
				<span class='text'>None of the extant fragments have this name in full but Fragments 7 and 15 are often restored to include it</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Campbell|1982|p=63 &amp; 65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joel Lidov has criticized this restoration, arguing that the Doricha story is not helpful in restoring any fragment by Sappho and that its origins lie in the work of [[Cratinus]] or another of Herodotus' comic contemporaries</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lidov, p</span>
				<span class='text'>203 and throughout</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The [[Suda]] is alone in claiming that Sappho was married to a &quot;very wealthy man called Cercylas, who traded from Andros&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Campbell|1982|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that he was Cleïs' father</span>

				<span class='text'>According to the [[Parian Marble]], Sappho was exiled to Sicily sometime between 604 BCE and 594 BCE and [[Cicero]] records that a statue of her stood in the town hall of Syracuse</span>
				<span class='text'>Unlike the works of her fellow poet, [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]], Sappho's surviving poetry has very few allusions to political conditions</span>
				<span class='text'>The principal exception is Fragment 98, which mentions exile and indicates that Sappho was lacking some of her customary luxuries</span>

				<span class='text'>==Phaon legend===A tradition going back at least to [[Menander]] (Fr</span>
				<span class='text'>258 K) suggested that Sappho killed herself by jumping off the Leucadian cliffs for love of [[Phaon]], a ferryman</span>

By Daniel Mendelsohn]&lt;/ref&gt;===Qualities of Sappho's poetry===David Campbell has briefly summarized some of the most arresting qualities of Sappho's poetry:&lt;blockquote&gt;Clarity of language and simplicity of thought are everywhere evident in our fragments; wit and rhetoric, so common in English love-poetry and not quite absent from Catullus' love poems, are nowhere to be found</span>
				<span class='text'>Her images are sharp—the sparrows that draw Aphrodite's chariot, the full moon in a starry sky, the solitary red apple at the tree-top—and she sometimes lingers over them to elaborate them for their own sake</span>
				<span class='text'>She quotes the direct words of conversations real or imaginary and so gains immediacy</span>
				<span class='text'>When the subject is the turbulence of her emotions, she displays a cool control in their expression</span>
				<span class='text'>Above all, her words are chosen for their sheer melody: the skill with which she placed her vowels and consonants, admired by Dionysius of Halicarnassus, is evidenced by almost any stanza; the music to which she sang them has gone, but the spoken sounds may still enchant</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Both fragments make direct allusions to scenes in Homer’s ''[[Iliad]]'', while Sappho also expands them with her own narrative illustrations</span>
				<span class='text'>Fragment 16, for instance, serves to characterise Helen, a key figure of Homer's, while Fragment 44 glorifies domestic joy by depicting the events leading to the wedding of Hector and Andromache</span>
				<span class='text'>he political atmosphere of Lesbos during Sappho's time paralleled that of Homer’s Troy, as the cities of Lesbos were constantly plagued with threats from Lydia</span>
				<span class='text'>Whereas Homer focused on depicting beauty through the glory of militarism, however, Sappho focused primarily on the portrayal of beauty through love</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/poem&gt;}}[[Claudius Aelianus]] wrote in ''Miscellany ({{lang|grc|Ποικίλη ἱστορία}})'' that [[Plato]] called Sappho wise</span>
				<span class='text'>A story is recounted in the ''Florilegium'' (3</span>
				<span class='text'>9</span>
				<span class='text'>8) of [[Stobaeus]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;Solon of Athens heard his nephew sing a song of Sappho's over the wine and, since he liked the song so much, he asked the boy to teach it to him</span>
				<span class='text'>When someone asked him why, he said: &quot;So that I may learn it, then die</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;A few centuries later, [[Horace]] wrote in his [[Odes of Horace|Odes]] that Sappho's lyrics were worthy of sacred admiration</span>
				<span class='text'>Part of one of Sappho's poems ([[Sappho_31|Fragment 31]]) was famously translated by the 1st-century BCE [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] poet [[Catullus]] in his &quot;''Ille mi par esse deo videtur''&quot; (&quot;He seems to me to be equal to a god&quot;) ([[Catullus 51]])</span>
				<span class='text'>==Loss and preservation of Sappho's works===Although Sappho's work endured well into [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times, her work was copied less and less as interests, styles, and aesthetics changed, especially after the academies stopped requiring her study</span>
				<span class='text'>Part of the reason for her disappearance from the standard canon was the predominance of [[Attic Greek|Attic]] and [[Homeric Greek]] as the languages required to be studied</span>
				<span class='text'>Sappho's [[Aeolic Greek]] [[dialect]] is a difficult one, and by Roman times it was arcane and ancient as well, posing considerable obstacles to her continued popularity</span>
				<span class='text'>Still, the greatest poets and thinkers of [[ancient Rome]] continued to emulate her or compare other writers to her, and it is through these comparisons and descriptions that we have received much of her extant poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>nce the major academies of the [[Byzantine Empire]] dropped her works from their standard curricula, very few copies of her works were made by scribes, and the 12th-century Byzantine scholar [[Tzetzes]] speaks of her works as lost</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Campbell|1982|pp=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;Modern legends describe Sappho's literary legacy as being the victim of purposeful obliteration by scandalized church leaders, often by means of [[book-burning]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Reynolds&quot;&gt;Reynolds (2002) 81&lt;/ref&gt; However, modern scholars have noted the echoes of Sappho Fragment 2 in a poem by [[Gregory of Nazianzus]], a [[Father of the Church]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Gregory's poem ''On Human Nature'' copies from Sappho the quasi-sacred grove (''alsos''), the wind-shaken branches, and the striking word for &quot;deep sleep&quot; (''kōma'')</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;It appears likely that Sappho's poetry was largely lost through action of the same indiscriminate forces of cultural change that have left us such paltry remains of all nine [[nine lyric poets|canonical Greek lyric poets]], of whom only [[Pindar]] (whose works alone survive in a manuscript tradition) and [[Bacchylides]] (our knowledge of whom we owe to a single dramatic papyrus find) have fared much better</span>
				<span class='text'>==Sources of the surviving fragments===Although the [[manuscript]] tradition broke off, some of Sappho's poetry has been discovered in Egyptian [[papyri]] fragments from an earlier period, such as those found in the ancient rubbish heaps of [[Oxyrhynchus]], where a major find brought many new but tattered verses to light, providing a major new source</span>

				<span class='text'>The rest of what we know of Sappho comes through citations in other ancient writers, often made to illustrate [[grammar]], [[vocabulary]], or meter</span>
				<span class='text'>==Translations into English===Poetry, such as Sappho's, written in [[quantitative verse]], is difficult to reproduce in [[English language|English]], which uses stress-based meters and rhyme compared to Ancient Greek's solely length-based meters</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Reynolds|2002|p=24}} As a result, many early translators used [[rhyme]] and worked Sappho's ideas into English poetic forms</span>
				<span class='text'>Still, the [[Sapphic stanza]], strongly associated with Sappho's poetry in the original, has become well known and influential among modern poets as well</span>

				<span class='text'>384)</span>
				<span class='text'>The 3rd-century philosopher [[Maximus of Tyre]] wrote that Sappho was &quot;small and dark&quot; and that her relationships to her female friends were similar to those of [[Socrates]]:{{quote|What else could one call the love of the Lesbian woman than the Socratic art of love?

				<span class='text'>21&lt;/ref&gt;}}During the [[Victorian era]], it became fashionable to describe Sappho as the headmistress of a girls' finishing school</span>
				<span class='text'>As Page DuBois (among many other experts) points out, this attempt at making Sappho understandable and palatable to the genteel classes of [[Great Britain]] was based more on conservative sensibilities than evidence</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;DuBois, ''Trojan Horses: Saving the Classics from Conservatives''&lt;/ref&gt; There are no references to teaching, students, academies, or tutors in any of Sappho's scant collection of surviving works</span>

				<span class='text'>Bowra]], in suggesting that Sappho's circle was somewhat akin to the Spartan ''[[agelai]]'' or the religious [[Sacred Band of Thebes|sacred band]], the ''[[thiasos]]'', but Burnett nuances her argument by noting that Sappho's circle was distinct from these contemporary examples because &quot;membership in the circle seems to have been voluntary, irregular and to some degree international</span>
