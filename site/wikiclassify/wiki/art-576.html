				<span class='text'>He was one of the earliest cartoonists to work in the [[American comic book]] industry, and his series ''[[The Spirit]]'' (1940–1952) was noted for its experiments in content and form</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1978, he popularized the term &quot;[[graphic novel]]&quot; with the publication of his book ''[[A Contract with God]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>He was an early contributor to formal [[comics studies]] with his book ''[[Comics and Sequential Art]]'' (1985)</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Eisner Award]] was named in his honor, and is given to recognize achievements each year in the comics medium; he was one of the three inaugural inductees to the [[List of Eisner Award winners#The Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame|Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame]]</span>

				<span class='text'> He aspired to be an artist, and as a teenager painted murals for rich patrons and Catholic churches in [[Vienna]]</span>
				<span class='text'> To avoid conscription in the army, he moved to New York before the outbreak of [[World War I]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Schumacher|2010|p=2}}  There he found getting work difficult as his English skills were poor</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Schumacher|2010|pp=2–3}}  He made what living he could painting backdrops for [[vaudeville]] and the Jewish theater</span>

				<span class='text'> Her mother died on her tenth birthday, and was quickly followed by her father</span>
				<span class='text'> An older stepsister thereafter raised her and kept her so busy with chores that she had little time for socializing or schooling; she did what she could later in life to keep knowledge of her illiteracy from her children</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Schumacher|2010|p=10}}  He was a voracious consumer of [[pulp magazines]] and film, including avant-garde films such as those by [[Man Ray]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Schumacher|2010|pp=8–9}}  To his mother's disappointment, Eisner had his father's interest in art, and his father encouraged him by buying him art supplies</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Schumacher|2010|p=10}}Eisner's mother frequently berated his father for not providing the family a better income, as he went from one job to another</span>
				<span class='text'> Without success he also tried his hand at such ventures as a furniture retailer and a coat factory</span>

				<span class='text'>isner said that on one occasion a man who Eisner described as &quot;a [[Mafia|Mob]] type straight out of [[Damon Runyon]], complete with pinkie ring, broken nose, black shirt, and white tie, who claimed to have 'exclusive distribution rights for all [[Brooklyn]]&quot; asked Eisner to draw [[Tijuana bible]]s for $3 a page</span>

				<span class='text'>Full of double entendres, ''Operation and Preventive Maintenance The M16A1 Rifle'' is a classic example of Eisner's incredible ability to combine effectively informational/instructional design with graphic design</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt;While Eisner's later graphic novels were entirely his own work, he had a studio working under his supervision on ''The Spirit''</span>
				<span class='text'>In particular, [[letterer]] [[Abe Kanegson]] came up with the distinctive lettering style which Eisner himself would later imitate in his book-length works, and Kanegson would often rewrite Eisner's dialogue</span>

				<span class='text'>Eisner later said of their working methods &quot;You should hear me and Jules Feiffer going at it in a room</span>

				<span class='text'>=Post-war comics==On Eisner's return from service and resumption of his role in the studio, he created the bulk of the ''Spirit'' stories on which his reputation was solidified</span>
				<span class='text'>The post-war years also saw him attempt to launch the comic-strip/comic-book series ''Baseball,'' ''John Law,'' ''Kewpies,'' and ''Nubbin the Shoeshine Boy;'' none succeeded, but some material was recycled into ''The Spirit''</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}''The Spirit'' ceased publishing in 1952</span>
				<span class='text'>During the 1960s and 1970s, various publishes reprinted the adventures often with covers by Eisner and with a few new stories from him</span>
				<span class='text'>=American Visuals Corporation==During his World War II military service, Eisner had introduced the use of comics for training personnel in the publication ''Army Motors'', for which he created the cautionary bumbling soldier Joe Dope, who illustrated various methods of [[preventive maintenance]] of various military equipment and weapons</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1948, while continuing to do ''The Spirit'' and seeing television and other post-war trends eat at the readership base of newspapers, he formed the American Visuals Corporation in order to produce instructional materials for the government, related agencies, and businesses</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Schumacher|2010}}One of his longest-running jobs was ''[[PS, The Preventive Maintenance Monthly]],'' a [[digest size]]d magazine with comic book elements that he started for the Army in 1951 and continued to work on until the 1970s with [[Klaus Nordling]], [[Mike Ploog]], and other artists</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, Eisner produced other military publications such as the graphic manual in 1969, ''[http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>]In the late 1970s, Eisner turned his attention to longer storytelling forms</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[A Contract with God, and Other Tenement Stories]]'' (Baronet Books, October 1978) is an early example of an American graphic novel, combining thematically linked short stories into a single square-bound volume</span>
				<span class='text'>Eisner continued with a string of graphic novels that tell the history of New York's immigrant communities, particularly [[Jew]]s, including ''[[The Building (comics)|The Building]]'', ''A Life Force'', ''Dropsie Avenue'' and ''To the Heart of the Storm''</span>
				<span class='text'>He continued producing new books into his seventies and eighties, at an average rate of nearly one a year</span>

				<span class='text'>In 2002, at the age of 85, he published ''[[Sundiata]]'', based on the part-historical, part-mythical stories of a West African king, &quot;The Lion of [[Mali]]&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>=Teaching==In his later years especially, Eisner was a frequent lecturer about the craft and uses of sequential art</span>
				<span class='text'>He taught at the [[School of Visual Arts]] in New York City, where he published ''Will Eisner's Gallery'', a collection of work by his students{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} and wrote two books based on these lectures, ''[[Comics and Sequential Art]]'' and ''[[Graphic Storytelling and Visual Narrative]]'', which are widely used by students of cartooning</span>
