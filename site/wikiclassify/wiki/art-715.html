				<span class='text'>He took employment as painter and ''[[Valet de chambre]]'' with [[John III, Duke of Bavaria|John of Bavaria-Straubing]], ruler of Holland, in the Hague around 1422, when he was already a master painter with workshop assistants</span>
				<span class='text'>After John's death in 1425 he was employed as court painter to [[Philip the Good]], Duke of Burgundy, in [[Lille]], where he remained until 1429 after which he moved to [[Bruges]], working for Philip until his death there in 1441</span>
				<span class='text'>It is known that he was highly regarded by Philip, and undertook a number of diplomatic visits abroad on his behalf, including to Lisbon in 1428 to arrange the Duke's marriage contract with [[Isabella of Portugal, Duchess of Burgundy|Isabella of Portugal]]</span>
				<span class='text'>an Eyck painted both secular and religious subject matter, including commissioned portraits, donor portraits (with the donor kneeling before a seated [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]]) and both large and portable altarpieces</span>
				<span class='text'>He worked on panel, either as single panels, diptych,&lt;ref&gt;Since dismantled&lt;/ref&gt; triptychs, or polyptychs</span>
				<span class='text'>He was well paid by Philip, who sought that the painter was secure financially and thus had artistic freedom and could paint &quot;whenever he pleased&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;C174&quot;&gt;Campbell (1998), 174&lt;/ref&gt; His work comes from the [[International Gothic]] style, but he soon eclipsed it, in part through a greater emphasis on naturalism and realism</span>
				<span class='text'>Van Eyck utilised a new level of virtuosity, mainly through the use of oil as a medium; the fact that oil dries so slowly allowed him more time and more scope for blending and mixing layers of different pigments</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Toman 2011 322&quot;&gt;Toman (2011), 322&lt;/ref&gt; He was highly influential and his techniques and style were quickly adopted and refined by [[Robert Campin]] and [[Rogier van der Weyden]] and later generations of [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish painters]]</span>

				<span class='text'>27–8, 1980, Montreux, Lausanne, ISBN 2-88260-009-7&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests a date of birth of 1395 at the latest</span>
				<span class='text'>However, his apparent age in the London [[Portrait of a Man (Self Portrait?)|probable self-portrait]] of 1433 suggests to most scholars a date closer to 1380</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;C174&quot;/&gt; He was identified in the late 1500s&lt;ref&gt;By the [[Ghent]] [[Renaissance Humanist|humanist]] Marcus van Vaernewyck and Lucas de Heer of Ghent&lt;/ref&gt; as having been born in [[Maaseik]], then a diocese of [[Liège]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This claim is still considered credible on etymological grounds, considering that &quot;Van Eyck&quot; means &quot;of Eyck&quot; which is an old variant spelling of &quot;eik&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>It is also supported by the fact that his daughter Lievine was in a nunnery in Maaseik after her father's death</span>
				<span class='text'>Further the notes on his study preparatory drawing for ''[[Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati]]'' are written in the Maasland dialect</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;b8&quot;/&gt;He had a sister Margareta, and at least two brothers, [[Hubert van Eyck|Hubert]] (died 1426) and Lambert (active between 1431 and 1442), both of whom were also painters</span>

				<span class='text'>From the coats of arms on his tombstone, it is believed he came from the gentry class</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;C174&quot; /&gt; This level of education was rare amongst painters, and surely made him more attractive to Philip as ''Valet de chambre''</span>

				<span class='text'>By this time van Eyck had assembled a small workshop and was involved in redecorating the [[Binnenhof]] palace in [[The Hague]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After John's death in 1425 he moved to Bruges and came to the attention of [[Philip the Good]] c</span>

				<span class='text'>He served as both court artist and diplomat and became a senior member of the Tournai [[Guild of Saint Luke|painters' guild]]</span>
				<span class='text'>On 18 October 1427, the Feast of St</span>
				<span class='text'>Luke, he travelled to Tournai to attend a banquet in his honour, also attended by [[Robert Campin]] and [[Rogier van der Weyden]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;b9&quot;&gt;Borchert (2008), 9&lt;/ref&gt;Because of the regular salary he received from the court he was not dependent on commissions, and thus had relative artistic freedom</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jones (2011), 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- immune from painter's guild as ducal employee --&gt; Over the following decade van Eyck's reputation and technical ability grew, mostly from his innovative approaches towards the handling and manipulating of oil paint</span>
				<span class='text'>Unlike most of his peers his reputation never diminished and he remained well regarded over the following centuries</span>
				<span class='text'>His revolutionary approach to oil was such that a myth, perpetuated by [[Giorgio Vasari]], arose that he had invented [[oil painting]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{efn-ua|The myth was propagated by [[Karel van Mander]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In fact oil painting as a technique for painting wood statues and other objects is much older and [[Theophilus Presbyter|Theophilus]] ([[Roger of Helmarshausen]]?) clearly gives instructions in his 1125 treatise, ''On Divers Arts''</span>
				<span class='text'>It is accepted that the van Eyck brothers were among the earliest Early Netherlandish painters to employ it for detailed [[panel painting]]s and that they achieved new and unforeseen effects through the use of glazes, [[wet-on-wet]] and other techniques</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|240px|''[[The Arnolfini Portrait]]'', 1434; [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery]], London]]It is known from historical record that van Eyck was considered a revolutionary master across northern Europe within his lifetime; his designs and methods were heavily copied and reproduced</span>
				<span class='text'>His motto, one of the first and still most distinctive signatures in art history, ''&lt;small&gt;ALS IK KAN&lt;/small&gt;'' (&quot;AS I CAN&quot;), a pun on his name,&lt;ref&gt;Nash (2008), 152&lt;/ref&gt; first appeared in 1433 on ''[[Portrait of a Man in a Turban]]'', which can be seen as indicative of his emerging self-confidence at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>The years between 1434 and 1436 are generally considered his high point when he produced works including the ''[[Madonna of Chancellor Rolin]]'', ''[[Lucca Madonna]]'' and ''[[Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>He married the much younger [[Portrait of Margaret van Eyck|Margaret]] probably around 1432, about the same time he bought a house in Bruges; she is unmentioned before he relocated, while the first of their two children was born in 1434</span>
				<span class='text'>Very little is known of Margaret, even her maiden name is lost - contemporary records refer to her mainly as ''Damoiselle Marguierite''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;t149&quot;/&gt; She is thought to have been of aristocratic birth, though from the lower nobility, evidenced from her clothes in this portrait which are fashion but not of the sumptuousness worn by the bride in the ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Later, as the widow of a renowned painter Margaret was afforded a modest pension by the city of Bruges after Jan's death</span>
				<span class='text'>At least some of this income was invested in [[lottery]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Van Der Elst (2005), 65&lt;/ref&gt;Records from 1437 on suggest that he was held in high esteem by the upper ranks of Burgundian nobility while also accepting many foreign commissions</span>
				<span class='text'>He died young in July 1441, leaving behind many unfinished works to be completed by workshop journeymen; works that are nevertheless today considered major examples of [[Early Flemish painting]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Borchert (2008), 94&lt;/ref&gt; His local and international reputation was aided by his ties to the then political and cultural influence of the Burgundian court</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|170px|left|''[[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)|Annunciation]]'', 1434–1436; [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington]]Following the death of John of Bavaria in 1425, van Eyck entered the service of the powerful and influential [[House of Valois-Burgundy|Valois]] prince, Duke [[Philip the Good]] of Burgundy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;C246&quot;&gt;Chilvers, 246&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to [[Lille]] for a year soon after completing the ''Ghent Altarpiece'', and then to [[Bruges]], where he lived until his death in 1441</span>
				<span class='text'>A number of documents published in the 20th century record his activities in Philip's service</span>
				<span class='text'>He was sent on several diplomatic missions on behalf of the Duke, and worked on several projects which likely entailed more than painting, such as his difficult journey to Lisbon along with a group intended to prepare the ground for the Duke's wedding to [[Isabella of Portugal, Duchess of Burgundy|Isabella of Portugal]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Van Eyck's task was to [[Portrait of Isabella of Portugal (van Eyck)|paint the bride]], so that the Duke could visualise her before their marriage</span>
				<span class='text'>Because Portugal was ridden with [[Black Death|plague]], their court was itinerant and the Dutch party met them at the out of the way [[House of Aviz|castle of Aviz]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Van Eyck spent nine months there, returning successfully to the Netherlands with Isabella as a bride to be; the couple married on Christmas Day of 1429</span>

				<span class='text'>ISBN 1-4179-4509-5&lt;/ref&gt; The princess was probably not particularly attractive, and that is exactly how Van Eyck conveyed her in the now lost portrait</span>
				<span class='text'>Typically he showed his sitters as dignified, yet did not hide their imperfections</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;b35&quot;&gt;Borchert (2008), 35&lt;/ref&gt; After his return, he was preoccupied with completing the ''Ghent Altarpiece'', which was concentrated on 6 May 1432 at [[Saint Bavo Cathedral]] during an official ceremony for Philip</span>
				<span class='text'>an Eyck undertook a number of other journeys on Philip's behalf between 1426 and 1429, journeys described in records as &quot;secret&quot; commissions, for which he was paid multiples of his annual salary</span>
				<span class='text'>Their precise nature is still unknown, but they seem to involve his acting as envoy of the court</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1426 he departed for &quot;certain distant lands&quot;, possibly to the [[Holy Land]], a theory given weight by the topographical accuracy of [[Jerusalem]] in ''The Three Marys at the Tomb'', a painting completed by members of his workshop c 1440</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;b8&quot;&gt;Borchert (2008), 8&lt;/ref&gt;As court painter and [[valet de chambre]] to the Duke, van Eyck was exceptionally well paid</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;C246&quot; /&gt; His annual salary was quite high when he was first engaged, but it doubled twice in the first few years, and was often supplemented by special bonuses</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;C174&quot; /&gt; His salary alone makes him an exceptional figure among early Netherlandish painters, since most of them depended on individual commissions for their livelihoods</span>
				<span class='text'>An indication that his art and person were held in extraordinarily high regard is a document from 1435 in which the Duke scolded his treasurers for not paying the painter his salary, arguing that van Eyck would leave and that he would nowhere be able to find his equal in his &quot;art and science&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip also served as godfather to one of van Eyck's children,&lt;ref&gt;Chilvers (2004), 246&lt;/ref&gt; supported his widow upon the painter's death, and years later helped one of his daughters with the funds required to enter a convent</span>
				<span class='text'>an van Eyck died in Bruges on 9 July 1441 and was buried in the graveyard of the [[St Donatian's Cathedral|Church of St Donatian]]</span>
				<span class='text'>As a mark of respect, Philip made a one off payment to Jan's widow Margaret, to a value equal to the artist's annual salary</span>
				<span class='text'>After Jan's death, Lambert van Eyck continued to run the workshop,&lt;ref name=&quot;b12&quot; /&gt; and over the next few years Jan's reputation and stature steadily grew</span>
				<span class='text'>Early in 1442 Lambert had the body exhumed and placed in a location inside [[St</span>
				<span class='text'>Donatian's Cathedral]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1449 he is mentioned by the Italian humanist and antiquarian [[Ciriaco de' Pizzicolli]] as a painter of note and ability, and he is recorded by [[Bartolomeo Facio]] in 1456</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Giorgio Vasari]] credits him (erroneously) with the invention of oil painting in 1550</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;b94&quot;&gt;Borchert, 94&lt;/ref&gt;==Works==Jan van Eyck produced paintings for private clients in addition to his work at the court</span>
				<span class='text'>Foremost among these is the ''Ghent Altarpiece'' painted for the merchant, financier and politician [[Jodocus Vijdts]] and his wife Elisabeth Borluut</span>
				<span class='text'>Started sometime before 1426 and completed by 1432, the [[polyptych]] has been seen to represent &quot;the final conquest of reality in the North&quot;, differing from the great works of the [[Early Renaissance]] in Italy by virtue of its willingness to forgo classical idealization in favor of the faithful observation of nature</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;H169&quot; /&gt; Art historian [[Otto Pächt]] describes the interior of ''Madonna in the Church'' as a &quot;throne room&quot; which envelopes her as if a &quot;carrying case&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Her monumental stature borrows from the works of 12th- and 13th-century Italian artists such as [[Cimabue]] and [[Giotto]], who in turn reflect a tradition reaching back to an Italo-[[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] type and emphasis her identification with the cathedral itself</span>
				<span class='text'>Art historians in the 19th century thought the work was executed early in van Eyck's career and attributed her scale as the mistake of a relatively immature painter</span>
				<span class='text'>The idea that her size represents her embodiment as the church was first suggested by [[Erwin Panofsky]] in 1941</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Panofsky (1953), 145&lt;/ref&gt; [[Till-Holger Borchert]] says that van Eyck did not paint her as &quot;the Madonna in a church&quot;, but instead as metaphor, presenting Mary &quot;as the Church&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Many of van Eyck's religious works contain a reduced interior space that is nonetheless subtly managed and arranged to convey a sense of intimacy without feeling constricted</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''[[Madonna of Chancellor Rolin]]'' is lit from both from the central portico and side windows, while the floor-tiles in comparison to other elements shows that the figures are only about six feet from the columned loggia screen, and that Rolin might have had to squeeze himself through the opening to get out that way</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Harbison (1991), 100&lt;/ref&gt; The different elements of the cathedral are in ''Madonna in the Church '' are so specifically detailed, and the elements of Gothic and contemporary architecture so well delineated, that many art and architecture historians have concluded that he must have had enough architectural knowledge to make nuanced distinctions</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Snyder (1985), 100; Harbison (1991), 169–175&lt;/ref&gt; But in all the buildings in van Eyck's work, the structure is imagined and probably an idealized formation of what he viewed as a perfect architectural space</span>

				<span class='text'>This work shows a very similar gothic interior to the Berlin ''[[Madonna in the Church]]'']]Since 1901 Jan van Eyck has often been credited as the anonymous artist known as Hand G of the [[Turin-Milan Hours]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{efn-ua|It is also possible that Hand G was a follower of Van Eyck's</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kren (2003), 83&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence for attributing van Eyck rests on part on the fact that although the figures are mostly of the [[International Gothic]] type, they reappear in some of his later work</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, there are coats of arms connected with the Wittelsbach family with whom he had connections in the Hague, while some of the figures in the miniatures echo the horsemen in the ''Ghent Altarpiece''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Borchert (2008), 83&lt;/ref&gt;Most of these miniatures were destroyed by fire in 1904 and survive only in photographs and copies; only three pages at most attributed to Hand G now survive, those with large miniatures of the ''[[Nativity of St</span>

				<span class='text'>A heavenly throne is clearly represented in some domestic chambers (for example in the ''[[Lucca Madonna]]'')</span>
				<span class='text'>More difficult to discern are the settings for paintings such as ''Madonna of Chancellor Rolin'', where the location is a fusion of the earthly and celestial</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Harbison (1984), 590–592&lt;/ref&gt; Van Eyck's iconography is often so densely and intricately layered that a work has to be viewed multiple times before even the most obvious meaning of an element is apparent</span>
				<span class='text'>The symbols were often subtly woven into the paintings so that they only became apparent after close and repeated viewing,&lt;ref name=&quot;w11&quot; /&gt; while much of the iconography reflects the idea that, according to John Ward, there is a &quot;promised passage from sin and death to salvation and rebirth&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Harbison (1997), 163&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''Kan'' derives from the [[Middle Dutch]] word ''kunnen'' related to the German ''Kunst'' (&quot;art&quot;)</span>

				<span class='text'>With this gesture Isabella extends her presence out of the pictorial space and into that of the viewer</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;p110&quot; /&gt;Many of the original frames are lost and known only through copies or inventory records</span>
				<span class='text'>The London ''[[Portrait of a Man (Self Portrait?)|Portrait of a Man]]'' was likely half of a double portrait or pendant; the last record of the original frames contained many inscriptions, but not all were original; the frames were often overpainted by later artists</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;c32&quot; /&gt; ''[[Portrait of Jan de Leeuw]]'' also bears its original frame, which is painted over to look like bronze</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;bauman35&quot;&gt;Bauman, 35&lt;/ref&gt;Many of his frames are heavily inscribed, which serves a dual purpose</span>
				<span class='text'>They are decorative but also function to set the context for the significance of the imagery, similar to the function of margins in medieval manuscripts</span>
				<span class='text'>Pieces such as the ''Dresden Tryptich'' were usually commissioned for private devotion, and van Eyck would have expected the viewer to contemplate text and imagery in unison</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;s146&quot;&gt;Smith, 146&lt;/ref&gt; The interior panels of the small 1437 ''[[Dresden Triptych]]'' are outlined with two layers of painted bronze frames, inscribed with mostly Latin lettering</span>
				<span class='text'>The texts are drawn from a variety of sources, in the central frames from biblical descriptions of the [[Assumption of Mary|assumption]], while the inner wings are lined with fragments of prayers dedicated to saints [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] and [[Catherine of Alexandria|Catherine]]</span>

				<span class='text'>This was not unusual; the widow or other relative of a master would often carry on the business after their death</span>
				<span class='text'>It is thought that Lambert took over after 1441</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Borchert (2008), 69&lt;/ref&gt; Such works are many and include the ''[[Ince Hall Madonna]]'', ''[[Saint Jerome in His Study (after van Eyck)|Saint Jerome in His Study]]'', a ''Madonna of Jan Vos'' (''Virgin and Child with St Barbara and Elizabeth'') c</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Borchert (2011), 150-59&lt;/ref&gt; A number of designs were reproduced by second generation Netherlandish artists of the first rank, including [[Petrus Christus]], who painted a version of the ''Exeter Madonna''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;b72&quot;&gt;Borchert (2008), 72&lt;/ref&gt;In other instances members of his workshop finished incomplete paintings after his death</span>
				<span class='text'>The upper portions of the right hand panel of the ''[[Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych]]'' are generally considered the work of a weaker painter with a less individual style</span>
				<span class='text'>It is thought that van Eyck died leaving the panel unfinished but with completed underdrawings, and the upper area was finished by workshop members or followers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;b86&quot;&gt;Borchert (2008), 86&lt;/ref&gt;Three works are confidently attributed but know only from copies</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[Portrait of Isabella of Portugal]]'' dates to his 1428 visit to Portugal for Philip to draw up a preliminary marriage agreement with the daughter of [[John I of Portugal]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;s38&quot;&gt;Seidel (1991), 38&lt;/ref&gt; From surviving copies it can be deduced that apart from the actual oak frame there were two other 'painted on' frames, one of which was lettered with gothic inscription to the top, while a faux stone parapet provided support for her hands to rest upon</span>

				<span class='text'>''Woman Bathing'' bears many similarities to ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'', including an interior with a bed and a small dog, a mirror and its reflection, a chest of drawers and clogs on the floor, while the angle the attendant woman faces from, and her dress and the outline of her figure, are broadly similar</span>

				<span class='text'>The plaque reads ''Huberto et Johanni van Eyck'']]In the earliest significant source on van Eyck, a 1454 biography in [[Genoa|Genoese]] humanist [[Bartolomeo Facio]]'s ''De viris illustribus'', Jan van Eyck is named &quot;the leading painter&quot; of his day</span>
				<span class='text'>Facio places him among the best artists of the early 15th century, along with [[Rogier van der Weyden]], [[Gentile da Fabriano]], and [[Pisanello]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It is particularly interesting that Facio shows as much enthusiasm for Netherlandish painters as he does for Italian painters</span>
				<span class='text'>This text sheds light on aspects of Jan van Eyck's production now lost, citing a bathing scene owned by a prominent Italian, but mistakenly attributing to van Eyck a world map painted by another</span>

				<span class='text'> Kim W</span>
				<span class='text'>Woods, and Michael W</span>
				<span class='text'>Franklin, 187&lt;/ref&gt; Facio records that van Eyck was a learned man, and that he was versed in the classics, particularly [[Pliny the Elder]]'s work on painting</span>
				<span class='text'>This is supported by records of an inscription from [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Ars Amatoria]]'', which was on the now-lost original frame of the ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'', and by the many Latin inscriptions in van Eyck paintings, often using the Greek alphabet</span>
