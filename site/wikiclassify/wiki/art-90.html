				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Eratosthenes's results were confirmed by a comparison of stellar observations at Alexandria and [[Rhodes]], carried out by [[Posidonius]] in the 1st century BC</span>
				<span class='text'>These measurements were widely known among scholars, but confusion about the old-fashioned units of distance in which they were expressed had led, in Columbus's day, to some debate about the exact size of the Earth</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Atlantic Ocean, Toscanelli, 1474</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|300px|Toscanelli's notions of the geography of the Atlantic Ocean, which directly influenced Columbus's plans]]From d'Ailly's ''Imago Mundi'' Columbus learned of [[Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Kathīr al-Farghānī|Alfraganus]]'s estimate that a degree of [[latitude]] (or a degree of [[longitude]] along the equator) spanned 56⅔ miles, but did not realize that this was expressed in the [[Arabic mile]] rather than the shorter [[Roman mile]] with which he was familiar (1,480 m)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Morison ([[#CITEREFMorison1942|1942, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>65, 93]])</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He therefore estimated the circumference of the Earth to be about 30,200&amp;nbsp;km, whereas the correct value is {{convert|40000|km|mi|abbr=on}}</span>
				<span class='text'>urthermore, most scholars accepted [[Ptolemy]]'s estimate that [[Eurasia]] spanned 180° [[longitude]], rather than the actual 130° (to the Chinese mainland) or 150° (to Japan at the latitude of Spain)</span>
				<span class='text'>Columbus, for his part, believed the even higher estimate of [[Marinus of Tyre]], which put the longitudinal span of the Eurasian landmass at 225°, leaving only 135° of water</span>
				<span class='text'>He also believed that Japan (which he called &quot;Cipangu&quot;, following [[Marco Polo]]) was much larger, farther to the east from China (&quot;Cathay&quot;), and closer to the equator than it is, and that there were inhabited islands even farther to the east than Japan, including the mythical [[Antillia]], which he thought might lie not much farther to the west than the [[Azores]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In this, he was influenced by the ideas of Florentine astronomer [[Toscanelli]], who corresponded with Columbus before his death in 1482 and who also defended the feasibility of a westward route to Asia</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Morison-Admiral&quot;&gt;[[Samuel Eliot Morison]], ''Admiral of the Ocean Sea: The Life of Christopher Columbus'', (Boston: Atlantic-Little, Brown, 1942)</span>
				<span class='text'>Reissued by the Morison Press, 2007</span>
				<span class='text'>ISBN 1-4067-5027-1&lt;/ref&gt;Columbus therefore estimated the distance from the [[Canary Islands]] to Japan to be about 3,000 Italian miles (3,700&amp;nbsp;km, or 2,300 statute miles)</span>
				<span class='text'>The true figure is now known to be vastly larger: about 12,500&amp;nbsp;km</span>
				<span class='text'>No ship in the 15th century could have carried enough food and fresh water for such a long voyage, and the dangers involved in navigating through the uncharted ocean would have been formidable</span>
				<span class='text'>Most European navigators reasonably concluded that a westward voyage from Europe to Asia was unfeasible</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Catholic Monarchs]], however, having completed [[Reconquista|an expensive war]] in the [[Iberian Peninsula]], were eager to obtain a competitive edge over other European countries in the quest for trade with the Indies</span>
				<span class='text'>Columbus's project, though far-fetched, held the promise of such an advantage</span>
				<span class='text'>== Nautical considerations ===Though Columbus was wrong about the number of degrees of longitude that separated Europe from the Far East and about the distance that each degree represented, he did possess valuable knowledge about the [[trade winds]], which would prove to be the key to his successful navigation of the Atlantic Ocean</span>
				<span class='text'>During his first voyage in 1492, the brisk trade winds from the east, commonly called &quot;[[easterlies]]&quot;, propelled Columbus's fleet for five weeks, from the [[Canary Islands]] to [[The Bahamas]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The precise first land sighting and landing point was [[San Salvador Island]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;murphy&quot;/&gt; To return to Spain against this prevailing wind would have required several months of an arduous sailing technique, called [[Close hauled#Close hauled|beating]], during which food and drinkable water would probably have been exhausted</span>
				<span class='text'>nstead, Columbus returned home by following the curving trade winds northeastward to the middle latitudes of the North Atlantic, where he was able to catch the &quot;[[westerlies]]&quot; that blow eastward to the coast of Western Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>There, in turn, the winds curve southward towards the Iberian Peninsula</span>

				<span class='text'>The corresponding technique for efficient travel in the Atlantic appears to have been exploited first by the Portuguese, who referred to it as the ''[[Volta do mar]]'' (&quot;turn of the sea&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>Columbus's knowledge of the Atlantic wind patterns was, however, imperfect at the time of his first voyage</span>
				<span class='text'>By sailing directly due west from the Canary Islands during [[List of Atlantic hurricane seasons|hurricane season]], skirting the so-called [[horse latitudes]] of the mid-Atlantic, Columbus risked either being becalmed or running into a [[tropical cyclone]], both of which he luckily avoided</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Morison-Admiral&quot; /&gt;=== Quest for financial support for a voyage ===In 1485, Columbus presented his plans to King [[John II of Portugal]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He proposed that the king equip three sturdy ships and grant Columbus one year's time to sail out into the Atlantic, search for a western route to the [[Orient]], and return</span>

				<span class='text'>he king submitted Columbus's proposal to his experts, who rejected it</span>
				<span class='text'>It was their considered opinion that Columbus's estimation of a travel distance of {{convert|2400|mi|km|-1}} was, in fact, far too low</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Morison-Admiral&quot;/&gt;In 1488, Columbus appealed to the court of Portugal once again, and once again, John II invited him to an audience</span>
				<span class='text'>That meeting also proved unsuccessful, in part because not long afterwards [[Bartolomeu Dias]] returned to Portugal with news of his successful rounding of the southern tip of Africa (near the [[Cape of Good Hope]])</span>
				<span class='text'>With an eastern sea route to Asia apparently at hand, King John was no longer interested in Columbus's far-fetched project</span>
				<span class='text'>olumbus traveled from Portugal to both [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], but he received encouragement from neither</span>
				<span class='text'>Columbus had also dispatched his brother [[Bartholomew Columbus|Bartholomew]] to the court of [[Henry VII of England]], to inquire whether the English crown might sponsor his expedition, but also without success</span>

				<span class='text'>After the passing of much time, the [[expert|savants]] of Spain, like their counterparts in [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], replied that Columbus had grossly underestimated the distance to Asia</span>
				<span class='text'>They pronounced the idea impractical and advised their Royal Highnesses to pass on the proposed venture</span>
				<span class='text'>owever, to keep Columbus from taking his ideas elsewhere, and perhaps to keep their options open, the [[Catholic Monarchs]] gave him an annual allowance of 12,000 ''[[maravedis]]'' and, in 1489, furnished him with a letter ordering all cities and towns under their domain to provide him food and lodging at no cost</span>
