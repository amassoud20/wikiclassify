				<span class='text'>He made major contributions to a number of fields, including [[mathematics]] ([[foundations of mathematics]], [[functional analysis]], [[ergodic theory]], [[geometry]], [[topology]], and [[numerical analysis]]), [[physics]] ([[quantum mechanics]], [[Fluid dynamics|hydrodynamics]], fluid dynamics and [[quantum statistical mechanics]]), [[economics]] ([[game theory]]), [[computing]] ([[Von Neumann architecture]], [[linear programming]], [[Von Neumann universal constructor|self-replicating machines]], [[stochastic computing]]), and [[statistics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>e was a pioneer of the application of [[operator theory]] to quantum mechanics, in the development of functional analysis, a principal member of the [[Manhattan Project]] and the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]] (as one of the few originally appointed), and a key figure in the development of game theory and the concepts of [[Cellular automaton|cellular automata]], the universal constructor and the [[Computer|digital computer]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He published 150  papers in his life; 60 in pure mathematics, 20 in physics, and 60 in applied mathematics</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Macrae|1992|p=32}}Although Max insisted von Neumann attend school at the grade level appropriate to his age, he agreed to hire private tutors to give him advanced instruction in those areas in which he had displayed an [[aptitude]]</span>
				<span class='text'>At the age of 15, he began to study advanced calculus under the renowned analyst [[Gábor Szegő]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=70-71}} On their first meeting, Szegő was so astounded with the boy's mathematical talent that he was brought to tears</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=70-71}} By the age of 19, von Neumann had published two major mathematical papers, the second of which gave the modern definition of [[ordinal number#Von Neumann definition of ordinals|ordinal number]]s, which superseded [[Georg Cantor]]'s definition</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Nasar|2001|p=81}} At the conclusion of his education at the gymnasium, von Neumann sat for and won the Eötvös Prize, a national prize for mathematics</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Macrae|1992|p=84}}Since there were few posts in Hungary for mathematicians, and those were not well-paid, his father wanted von Neumann to follow him into industry and therefore invest his time in a more financially useful endeavor than mathematics</span>
				<span class='text'> So it was decided that the best career path was to become a [[chemical engineer]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This was not something that von Neumann had much knowledge of, so it was arranged for him to take a two-year non-degree course in chemistry at the [[University of Berlin]], after which he sat the entrance exam to the prestigious [[ETH Zurich]],{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=85-87}} which he passed in September 1923</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Van Heijenoort|1967|pp=393-394}} At the beginning of the 20th century, efforts to base mathematics on [[naive set theory]] suffered a setback due to [[Russell's paradox]] (on the set of all sets that do not belong to themselves)</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=104-105}} The problem of an adequate axiomatization of [[set theory]] was resolved implicitly about twenty years later by [[Ernst Zermelo]] and [[Abraham Fraenkel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] provided a series of principles that allowed for the construction of the sets used in the everyday practice of mathematics</span>
				<span class='text'>But they did not explicitly exclude the possibility of the existence of a set that belongs to itself</span>
				<span class='text'>In his doctoral thesis of 1925, von Neumann demonstrated two techniques to exclude such sets—the ''[[axiom of regularity|axiom of foundation]]'' and the notion of ''[[Class (set theory)|class]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Notable colleagues were [[Georg Feigl]], [[Issai Schur]], [[Erhard Schmidt]], [[Leó Szilárd]], [[Heinz Hopf]], [[Adolf Hammerstein]] and [[Ludwig Bieberbach]]</span>
				<span class='text'>]The axiom of foundation established that every set can be constructed from the bottom up in an ordered succession of steps by way of the principles of Zermelo and Fraenkel, in such a manner that if one set belongs to another then the first must necessarily come before the second in the succession, hence excluding the possibility of a set belonging to itself</span>
				<span class='text'>To demonstrate that the addition of this new axiom to the others did not produce contradictions, von Neumann introduced a method of demonstration, called the ''method of [[inner model]]s'', which later became an essential instrument in set theory</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Van Heijenoort|1967|pp=393-394}}The second approach to the problem took as its base the notion of class, and defines a set as a class which belongs to other classes, while a ''proper class'' is defined as a class which does not belong to other classes</span>
				<span class='text'>Under the Zermelo–Fraenkel approach, the axioms impede the construction of a set of all sets which do not belong to themselves</span>
				<span class='text'>In contrast, under the von Neumann approach, the class of all sets which do not belong to themselves can be constructed, but it is a ''proper class'' and not a set</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Van Heijenoort|1967|pp=393-394}}With this contribution of von Neumann, the axiomatic system of the theory of sets became fully satisfactory, and the next question was whether or not it was also definitive, and not subject to improvement</span>
				<span class='text'>A strongly negative answer arrived in September 1930 at the historic mathematical Congress of [[Königsberg]], in which [[Kurt Gödel]] announced his [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|first theorem of incompleteness]]: the usual axiomatic systems are incomplete, in the sense that they cannot prove every truth which is expressible in their language</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|von Neumann|2005|p=123}}But von Neumann, who had participated at the Congress, confirmed his fame as an instantaneous thinker, and in less than a month was able to communicate to Gödel himself an interesting consequence of his theorem: namely that the usual axiomatic systems are unable to demonstrate their own consistency</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;quantum logic&quot; /&gt;The reason for this is that a quantum disjunction, unlike the case for classical disjunction, can be true even when both of the disjuncts are false and this is, in turn, attributable to the fact that it is frequently the case, in quantum mechanics, that a pair of alternatives are semantically determinate, while each of its members are necessarily indeterminate</span>
				<span class='text'>This latter property can be illustrated by a simple example</span>
				<span class='text'>Suppose we are dealing with particles (such as electrons) of semi-integral spin (angular momentum) for which there are only two possible values: positive or negative</span>
				<span class='text'>Then, a principle of indetermination establishes that the spin, relative to two different directions (e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> ''x'' and ''y'') results in a pair of incompatible quantities</span>
				<span class='text'>Suppose that the state '''ɸ''' of a certain electron verifies the proposition &quot;the spin of the electron in the ''x'' direction is positive</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; By the principle of indeterminacy, the value of the spin in the direction ''y'' will be completely indeterminate for '''ɸ'''</span>
				<span class='text'>Hence, '''ɸ''' can verify neither the proposition &quot;the spin in the direction of ''y'' is positive&quot; northe proposition &quot;the spin in the direction of ''y'' is negative</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Nevertheless, the disjunction of the propositions &quot;the spin in the direction of ''y'' is positive or the spin in the direction of ''y'' is negative&quot; must be true for '''ɸ'''</span>
				<span class='text'>n the case of distribution, it is therefore possible to have a situation in which ''&lt;math&gt;A \land (B\lor C)= A\land 1 = A&lt;/math&gt;'', while &lt;math&gt;(A\land B)\lor (A\land C)=0\lor 0=0&lt;/math&gt;</span>

				<span class='text'>Von Neumann showed that their minimaxes are equal (in absolute value) and contrary (in sign)</span>
				<span class='text'>Von Neumann improved and extended the minimax theorem to include games involving imperfect information and games with more than two players, publishing this result in his 1944 ''[[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]'' (written with [[Oskar Morgenstern]])</span>

				<span class='text'>For his model of an expanding economy, von Neumann proved the existence and uniqueness of an equilibrium using his generalization of the [[Brouwer fixed-point theorem]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=KuhnTucker/&gt; Von Neumann's model of an expanding economy considered the [[Eigendecomposition of a matrix#Generalized eigenvalue problem|matrix pencil]]&amp;nbsp;'' '''A'''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;λ'''B''' '' with nonnegative matrices&amp;nbsp;'''A''' and '''B'''; von Neumann sought [[probability vector|probability]] [[generalized eigenvector|vectors]]&amp;nbsp;''p'' and&amp;nbsp;''q'' and a positive number&amp;nbsp;''λ'' that would solve the [[complementarity theory|complementarity]] equation:&lt;math&gt;p^T (A - \lambda B) q = 0&lt;/math&gt;along with two inequality systems expressing economic efficiency</span>
				<span class='text'>In this model, the ([[transpose]]d) probability vector ''p'' represents the prices of the goods while the probability vector q represents the &quot;intensity&quot; at which the production process would run</span>
				<span class='text'>The unique solution ''λ'' represents the growth factor which is 1 plus the [[economic growth|rate of growth]] of the economy; the rate of growth equals the [[interest rate]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Proving the existence of a positive growth rate and proving that the growth rate equals the interest rate were remarkable achievements, even for von Neumann</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;For this problem to have a unique solution, it suffices that the nonnegative matrices&amp;nbsp;'''A''' and&amp;nbsp;'''B''' satisfy an [[Perron–Frobenius theorem|irreducibility condition]], generalizing that of the [[Perron–Frobenius theorem]] of nonnegative matrices, which considers the (simplified) [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalue problem]]: '''A''' − λ '''I''' ''q'' = 0,where the nonnegative matrix''&amp;nbsp;'''A''''' must be square and where the [[diagonal matrix]]''&amp;nbsp;'''I''' ''is the [[identity matrix]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Von Neumann's irreducibility condition was called the &quot;whales and [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|wranglers]]&quot; hypothesis by David Champernowne, who provided a verbal and economic commentary on the English translation of von Neumann's article</span>
				<span class='text'>Von Neumann's hypothesis implied that every economic process used a positive amount of every economic good</span>
				<span class='text'>Weaker &quot;irreducibility&quot; conditions were given by [[David Gale]] and by [[John George Kemeny|John Kemeny]], [[Oskar Morgenstern]], and [[Gerald L</span>
				<span class='text'>Thompson]] in the 1950s and then by Stephen M</span>

				<span class='text'>Arrow and Debreu also used linear programming, as did Nobel laureates [[Tjalling Koopmans]], [[Leonid Kantorovich]], [[Wassily Leontief]], [[Paul Samuelson]], [[Robert Dorfman]], [[Robert Solow]], and [[Leonid Hurwicz]]</span>
				<span class='text'>-&gt;Von Neumann's famous 9-page paper started life as a talk at Princeton and then became a paper in Germany, which was eventually translated into English</span>
				<span class='text'>His interest in economics that led to that paper began as follows: When lecturing at Berlin in 1928 and 1929 he spent his summers back home in Budapest, and so did the economist [[Nicholas Kaldor]], and they hit it off</span>
				<span class='text'>Kaldor recommended that von Neumann read a book by the mathematical economist [[Léon Walras]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Von Neumann found some faults in that book and corrected them, for example, replacing equations by inequalities</span>
				<span class='text'>He noticed that Walras's [[General Equilibrium Theory]] and [[Walras' Law]], which led to systems of simultaneous linear equations, could produce the absurd result that the profit could be maximized by producing and selling a negative quantity of a product</span>
				<span class='text'>He replaced the equations by inequalities, introduced dynamic equilibria, among other things, and eventually produced the paper</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=250-253}}===Linear programming===Building on his results on matrix games and on his model of an expanding economy, von Neumann invented the theory of duality in linear programming, after [[George Dantzig]] described his work in a few minutes, when an impatient von Neumann asked him to get to the point</span>

				<span class='text'>Von Neumann's method used a pivoting algorithm between simplices, with the pivoting decision determined by a nonnegative [[least squares]] subproblem with a convexity constraint ([[Projection (linear algebra)#Orthogonal projections|projecting]] the zero-vector onto the [[convex hull]] of the active [[simplex]])</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Groves|1962|pp=268–276}}On July 16, 1945, with numerous other Manhattan Project personnel, von Neumann was an eyewitness to the first atomic bomb blast, code named Trinity, conducted as a test of the implosion method device, at the [[Alamogordo Bombing Range|bombing range]] near [[Alamogordo Army Airfield]], {{convert|35|mi}} southeast of [[Socorro, New Mexico]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Based on his observation alone, von Neumann estimated the test had resulted in a blast equivalent to {{convert|5|ktonTNT|lk=on}} but [[Enrico Fermi]] produced a more accurate estimate of 10 kilotons by dropping scraps of torn-up paper as the shock wave passed his location and watching how far they scattered</span>
				<span class='text'>The actual power of the explosion had been between 20 and 22 kilotons</span>

				<span class='text'>He involved himself in correcting the severe shortage of [[tritium]] and [[lithium 6]] needed for these compact weapons, and he argued against settling for the intermediate range missiles that the Army wanted</span>

				<span class='text'>The Russians believed that bombers would soon be vulnerable, and they shared von Neumann's view that an H-bomb in an ICBM was the [[ne plus ultra]] of weapons, and they believed that whoever had superiority in these weapons would take over the world, without necessarily using them</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=362–363}} He was afraid of a &quot;missile gap&quot; and took several more steps to achieve his goal of keeping up with the Soviets:*He modified the ENIAC by making it programmable and then wrote programs for it to do the H-bomb calculations verifying that the Teller-Ulam design was feasible and to develop it further</span>
				<span class='text'>Through the Atomic Energy Commission, he promoted the development of a compact H-bomb that would fit in an ICBM</span>

				<span class='text'>At the same time a fly that travels at a steady 15 mph starts from the front wheel of the southbound bicycle and flies to the front wheel of the northbound one, then turns around and flies to the front wheel of the southbound one again, and continues in this manner till he is crushed between the two front wheels</span>
				<span class='text'>Question: what total distance did the fly cover? The slow way to find the answer is to calculate what distance the fly covers on the first, northbound, leg of the trip, then on the second, southbound, leg, then on the third, etc</span>
				<span class='text'> etc</span>
				<span class='text'> and, finally, to sum the [[Series (mathematics)|infinite series]] so obtained</span>
				<span class='text'>The quick way is to observe that the bicycles meet exactly one hour after their start, so that the fly had just an hour for his travels; the answer must therefore be 15 miles</span>
				<span class='text'>When the question was put to von Neumann, he solved it in an instant, and thereby disappointed the questioner: &quot;Oh, you must have heard the trick before!&quot; &quot;What trick?&quot; asked von Neumann, &quot;All I did was sum the geometric series</span>
