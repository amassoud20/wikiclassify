				<span class='text'>His reign lasted for 49 years from 1658 until his death in 1707</span>
				<span class='text'>urangzeb was a notable expansionist and during his reign, the Mughal Empire temporarily reached its greatest extent</span>
				<span class='text'>During his lifetime, victories in the south expanded the [[Mughal Empire]] to [[List of largest empires#Largest empires by land area and population|more than 3</span>
				<span class='text'>&amp;nbsp;million square kilometres]] and he ruled over a population estimated as being in the range of 100–150 million subjects, with an annual yearly tribute of £38,624,680 in 1690 (the highest in the world at that time)</span>
				<span class='text'>urangzeb's policies partly abandoned the legacy of pluralism, which remains a very controversial aspect of his reign</span>
				<span class='text'>Rebellions and wars led to the exhaustion of the imperial Mughal treasury and army</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a strong-handed authoritarian ruler, and following his death the expansionary period of the Mughal Empire came to an end, and centralized control of the empire declined rapidly</span>

				<span class='text'>He regretted this and harboured feelings that Shikoh had manipulated the situation to serve his own ends</span>
				<span class='text'>Aurangbad's two ''[[jagir]]s'' (land grants) were moved there as a consequence of his return and, because the Deccan was a relatively impoverished area, this caused him to lose out financially</span>
				<span class='text'>So poor was the area that grants were required from [[Malwa]] and Gujarat in order to maintain the administration and the situation caused ill-feeling between father and son</span>

				<span class='text'>As an adjunct to resolving the financial difficulties, the proposal would also extend Mughal influence by accruing more lands</span>
				<span class='text'>Again, he was to feel that Dara had exerted influence on his father: believing that he was on the verge of victory in both instances, Aurangzeb was frustrated that Shah Jahan chose then to settle for negotiations with the opposing forces rather than pushing for complete victory</span>
