				<span class='text'>His reign lasted for 49 years from 1658 until his death in 1707</span>

				<span class='text'>urangzebs policies partly abandoned the legacy of pluralism which remains a very controversial aspect of his reign</span>
				<span class='text'>Rebellions and wars led to the exhaustion of the imperial Mughal treasury and army</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a strong handed authoritarian ruler and following his death the expansionary period of the Mughal Empire came to an end and centralized control of the empire declined rapidly</span>

				<span class='text'>500 which he spent on religious education and the study of history</span>
				<span class='text'>He also accused his brothers of alcoholism and womanising</span>

				<span class='text'>Aurangzebs valour was appreciated by his father who conferred him the title of  Brave and had him weighed in gold and presented gifts worth Rs</span>

				<span class='text'> In 1637 Aurangzeb married the  princess  also known as Rabia ud Daurani</span>
				<span class='text'>She was his first wife and chief consort</span>
				<span class='text'>  He also had an infatuation with a slave girl Hira Bai whose death at a young age greatly affected him</span>
				<span class='text'>In his old age he was under the charms of his concubine Udaipuri Bai</span>
				<span class='text'>The latter had formerly been a companion to Dara Shikoh</span>
				<span class='text'> In the same year 1637 Aurangzeb was placed in charge of annexing the small  kingdom of  which he did with ease</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1644 Aurangzebs sister  was burned when the chemicals in her perfume were ignited by a nearby lamp while in </span>
				<span class='text'>This event precipitated a family crisis with political consequences</span>
				<span class='text'>Aurangzeb suffered his fathers displeasure by not returning to Agra immediately but rather three weeks later</span>
				<span class='text'>Shah Jahan had been nursing Jahanara back to health in that time and thousands of vassals had arrived in Agra to pay their respects</span>
				<span class='text'>Shah Jahan was outraged to see Aurangzeb enter the interior palace compound in military attire and immediately dismissed him from his position of Viceroy of the Deccan Aurangzeb was also no longer allowed to use red tents or to associate himself with the official military standard of the Mughal emperor</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1645 he was barred from the court for seven months and mentioned his grief to fellow Mughal commanders</span>
				<span class='text'>Thereafter Shah Jahan appointed him governor of Gujarat where he served well and was rewarded for bringing stability</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1647 Shah Jahan moved Aurangzeb from Gujarat to be governor of  replacing a younger son  who had proved ineffective there</span>
				<span class='text'>The area was under attack from  and  tribes</span>
				<span class='text'>Whilst the Mughal artillery and muskets were a formidable force so too were the skirmishing skills of their opponents</span>
				<span class='text'>The two sides were in stalemate and Aurangzeb discovered that his army could not live off the land which was devastated by war</span>
				<span class='text'>With the onset of winter he and his father had to make a largely unsatisfactory deal with the Uzbeks giving away territory in exchange for nominal recognition of Mughal sovereignty</span>
				<span class='text'>The Mughal force suffered still further with attacks by Uzbeks and other tribesmen as it retreated through snow to </span>
				<span class='text'>By the end of this two year campaign into which Aurangzeb had been plunged at a late stage a vast sum of money had been expended for little gain</span>
				<span class='text'>Further inauspicious military involvements followed as Aurangzeb was appointed governor of  and </span>
				<span class='text'>His efforts in 1649 and 1652 to dislodge the s at  which they had recently retaken after a decade of Mughal control both ended in failure as winter approached</span>
				<span class='text'>The logistical problems of supplying an army at the extremity of the empire combined with the poor quality of armaments and the intransigence of the opposition have been cited by John Richards as the reasons for failure and a third attempt in 1653 led by Dara Shikoh met with the same outcome</span>
				<span class='text'>Dara Shikohs appointment followed the removal of Aurangzeb who once again became Viceroy in the Deccan</span>
				<span class='text'>He regretted this and harboured feelings that Shikoh had manipulated the situation to serve his own ends</span>
				<span class='text'>Aurangbads two s land grants were moved there as a consequence of his return and because the Deccan was a relatively impoverished area this caused him to lose out financially</span>
				<span class='text'>So poor was the area that grants were required from  and Gujarat in order to maintain the administration and the situation caused ill feeling between father and son</span>
				<span class='text'>Shah Jahan insisted that things could be improved if Aurangzeb made efforts to develop cultivation but the efforts that were made proved too slow in producing results to satisfy the emperor</span>
				<span class='text'>name Chandra2005p267  Aurangzeb proposed to resolve the situation by attacking the dynastic occupants of  the s and  the s</span>
				<span class='text'>As an adjunct to resolving the financial difficulties the proposal would also extend Mughal influence by accruing more lands</span>
				<span class='text'>Again he was to feel that Dara had exerted influence on his father believing that he was on the verge of victory in both instances Aurangzeb was frustrated that Shah Jahan chose then to settle for negotiations with the opposing forces rather than pushing for complete victory</span>
				<span class='text'>name Chandra2005p267  The four sons of Shah Jahan all held posts as governors during their fathers reign</span>
				<span class='text'>The emperor favoured the eldest Dara Shikoh and this had caused resentment among the younger three who sought at various times to strengthen alliances between themselves and against Dara</span>
				<span class='text'>There was no Muslim tradition of  and historian  says that In the ultimate resort connections among the powerful military leaders and military strength and capacity were the real arbiters</span>
				<span class='text'>name Chandra2005p267   Jacques Weber emeritus professor of modern history at the   explains that </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>mpnbspthe loyalties of these officials seem to have been motivated more by their own interests the closeness of the family relation and above all the charisma of the pretenders than by ideological divides</span>
				<span class='text'> The contest for power was primarily between Dara Shikoh and Aurangzeb because although all four sons had demonstrated competence in their official roles it was around these two that the supporting cast of officials and other influential people mostly circulated</span>
				<span class='text'> There were ideological differencesampnbsp— Dara was an intellectual and a religious liberal in the mould of Akbar while Aurangzeb was much more conservativeampnbsp—ampnbspbut as historians  and  say To focus on divergent philosophies neglects the fact that Dara was a poor general and leader</span>
				<span class='text'>It also ignores the fact that factional lines in the succession dispute were not by and large shaped by ideologyampnbsp</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> Muslims and Hindus did not divide along religious lines in their support for one pretender or the other nor according to Chandra is there much evidence to support the belief that Jahanara and other members of the royal family were split in their support</span>
				<span class='text'>Jahanara certainly interceded at various times on behalf of all of the princes and was well regarded by Aurangzeb even though she shared the religious outlook of Dara</span>
				<span class='text'>name Chandra2005p271  In 1656 a general under  named Musa Khan lead an army of 12000 Musketeers to attack Aurangzeb and later on the same campaign Aurangzeb in turn rode against an army consisting 8000 horsemen and 20000  Musketeers Having made clear that he wanted Dara to succeed him Shah Jahan became ill with  in 1657 and was closeted under the care of his favourite son in the newly built city of  Old Delhi</span>
				<span class='text'>Rumours of the death of Shah Jahan abounded and the younger sons were concerned that Dara might be hiding it for  reasons</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus they took action  prepared to contest the throne from  where he had been governor since 1637 while Murad did the same in his governorship of Gujarat and Aurangzeb did so in the Deccan</span>
				<span class='text'>It is not known whether these preparations were made in the mistaken belief that the rumours of death were true or whether the challengers were just taking advantage of the situation</span>
				<span class='text'>name Chandra2005p267 After regaining some of his health Shah Jahan moved to Agra and Dara urged him to send forces to challenge Shah Shuja and Murad who had declared themselves rulers in their respective territories</span>
				<span class='text'>While Shah Shuja was defeated at  in February 1658 the army sent to deal with Murad discovered to their surprise that he and Aurangzeb had combined their forces name Chandra2005p271   the two brothers having agreed to partition the empire once they had gained control of it</span>
				<span class='text'>name Chandra2005p272   The two armies clashed at Dharmat in April 1658 with Aurangzeb being the victor</span>
				<span class='text'>Shuja was being chased through  and the victory of Aurangzeb proved this to be a poor decision by Dara Shikoh who now had a defeated force on one front and a successful force unnecessarily pre occupied on another</span>
				<span class='text'>Realising that his recalled Bihar forces would not arrive at Agra in time to resist the emboldened Aurangzebs advance Dara scrambled to form alliances in order but found that Aurangzeb had already courted key potential candidates</span>
				<span class='text'>When Daras disparate hastily concocted army clashed with Aurangzebs well disciplined battle hardened force at the  in late May neither Daras men nor his generalship were any match for Aurangzeb</span>
				<span class='text'>Dara had also become over confident in his own abilities and by ignoring advice not to lead in battle while his father was alive he cemented the idea that he had usurped the throne</span>
				<span class='text'>name Chandra2005p271  After the defeat of Dara Shah Jahan was imprisoned in the fort of Agra where he spent eight long years under the care of his favourite daughter Jahanara</span>
				<span class='text'>name sen2 Aurangzeb then broke his arrangement with Murad Baksh which probably had been his intention all along</span>
				<span class='text'>name Chandra2005p272   Instead of looking to partition the empire between himself and Murad he had his brother arrested and imprisoned at Gwalior Fort</span>
				<span class='text'>Murad was executed on 4 December 1661 ostensibly for the murder of the  of Gujarat some time earlier</span>
				<span class='text'>The allegation was encouraged by Aurangzeb who caused the diwans son to seek retribution for the death under the principles of </span>
				<span class='text'> Meanwhile Dara gathered his forces and moved to the </span>
				<span class='text'>The army sent against Shuja was trapped in the east its generals  and Dilir Khan submitted to Aurangzeb but Daras son Suleiman Shikoh escaped</span>
				<span class='text'>Aurangzeb offered Shah Shuja the governorship of Bengal</span>
				<span class='text'>This move had the effect of isolating Dara Shikoh and causing more troops to defect to Aurangzeb</span>
				<span class='text'>Shah Shuja who had declared himself emperor in Bengal began to annex more territory and this prompted Aurangzeb to march from Punjab with a new and large army that fought during the  where Shah Shuja and his  armored war elephants were routed by the forces loyal to Aurangzeb</span>
				<span class='text'>Shah Shuja then fled to  in present day Burma where he was executed by the local rulers</span>

				<span class='text'>With Shuja and Murad disposed of and with his father immured in Agra Aurangzeb pursued Dara Shikoh chasing him across the north western bounds of the empire</span>
				<span class='text'>Aurangzeb claimed that Dara was no longer a Muslim and accused him of poisoning the Mughal  Saadullah Khan</span>
				<span class='text'>Both of these statements however lacked any evidence</span>
				<span class='text'>After a series of battles defeats and retreats Dara was betrayed by one of his generals who arrested and bound him</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1658 Aurangzeb arranged his formal coronation in Delhi</span>
				<span class='text'>n 10 August 1659 Dara was executed on grounds of apostasy</span>
				<span class='text'>name sen2   Having secured his position Aurangzeb confined his frail father at the Agra Fort but did not mistreat him</span>
				<span class='text'>Shah Jahan was cared for by Jahanara and died in 1666</span>
				<span class='text'>name Chandra2005p272 ReignHistorian Katherine Brown has noted that The very name of Aurangzeb seems to act in the popular imagination as a signifier of politico religious bigotry and repression regardless of historical accuracy</span>
