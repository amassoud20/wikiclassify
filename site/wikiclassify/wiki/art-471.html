				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Merriman</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Under his administration, the Ottoman State ruled over 20 to 30 million people</span>
				<span class='text'>uleiman became a prominent monarch of 16th-century Europe, presiding over the apex of the Ottoman Empire's military, political and economic power</span>
				<span class='text'>Suleiman personally led Ottoman armies in conquering the Christian strongholds of [[Belgrade]] and [[Rhodes]] as well as most of [[Hungary]] before his conquests were checked at the [[Siege of Vienna]] in 1529</span>
				<span class='text'>He annexed much of the [[Middle East]] in his conflict with the Persian [[Safavid dynasty|Safavids]] and large areas of [[North Africa]] as far west as [[Algeria]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Under his rule, the [[Ottoman Navy|Ottoman fleet]] dominated the seas from the [[Mediterranean]] to the [[Red Sea]] and through the [[Persian Gulf]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Mansel, 61</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;At the helm of an expanding empire, Suleiman personally instituted major legislative changes relating to society, education, taxation and criminal law</span>
				<span class='text'>His canonical law (or the ''Kanuns'') fixed the form of the empire for centuries after his death</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a distinguished poet and goldsmith; he also became a great patron of culture, overseeing the &quot;Golden&quot; age of the Ottoman Empire in its [[Culture of the Ottoman Empire|artistic]], [[Turkish literature#Ottoman literature|literary]] and [[Ottoman architecture#Classical period (1437–1703)|architectural]] development</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=atil24&gt;Atıl, 24</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Breaking with Ottoman tradition, Suleiman married Roxelana, a former Christian girl converted to [[Islam]] from his [[harem]], who became subsequently known and influential as [[Hürrem Sultan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Their son [[Selim II]] succeeded Suleiman following his death in 1566 after 46 years of rule, thus beginning a long state of stagnation and decline during Selim II's reign</span>
				<span class='text'>Suleiman's previous heir apparent [[Şehzade Mustafa|Mustafa]] had been strangled to death 13 years previously at the sultan's order</span>
				<span class='text'>His other son [[Şehzade Bayezid|Bayezid]] had been killed by his support and Selim's order in 1561 with four of his sons</span>
				<span class='text'>=Alternative names and titles==Suleiman the Magnificent ({{lang|ota-Arab|محتشم سليمان}} ''Muḥteşem Süleymān''), as he was known in the [[Western world|West]], was also called Suleiman the First ({{lang|ota-Arab|سلطان سليمان أول}} ''Sulṭān Süleymān-ı Evvel''), and Suleiman the Lawgiver ({{lang|ota-Arab|قانونی سلطان سليمان}} ''Ḳānūnī Sulṭān Süleymān'') for his complete reconstruction of the Ottoman legal system</span>
				<span class='text'>=Early life==Suleiman was born in [[Trabzon]] along the east coast of the [[Black Sea]], probably on 6 November 1494</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; === Accession ===Upon the death of his father, [[Selim I]] (1465–1520), Suleiman entered Constantinople and ascended to the throne as the tenth Ottoman Sultan</span>
				<span class='text'>An early description of Suleiman, a few weeks following his accession, was provided by the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] envoy [[Bartolomeo Contarini (nobleman)|Bartolomeo Contarini]]: &quot;He is twenty-six years of age, tall, but wiry, and of a delicate complexion</span>
				<span class='text'>His neck is a little too long, his face thin, and his [[aquiline nose|nose aquiline]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He has a shade of a mustache and a small beard; nevertheless he has a pleasant mien, though his skin tends to be a light pallor</span>
				<span class='text'>He is said to be a wise Lord, fond of study, and all men hope for good from his rule</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kinross, 175</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Some historians claim that in his youth Suleiman had an admiration for [[Alexander the Great]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lamb, 14</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barber, 23</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He was influenced by Alexander's vision of building a world empire that would encompass the east and the west, and this created a drive for his subsequent military campaigns in Asia and in Africa, as well as in Europe</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|210px|Suleiman during the [[Siege of Rhodes (1522)|Siege of Rhodes]] in 1522</span>
				<span class='text'>]Upon succeeding his father, Suleiman began a series of military conquests, eventually suppressing a revolt led by the Ottoman-appointed governor of [[Damascus]] in 1521</span>
				<span class='text'>Suleiman soon made preparations for the [[Siege of Belgrade 1521|conquest of Belgrade]] from the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]—something his great-grandfather [[Mehmed II]] had failed to achieve because of [[John Hunyadi]]'s strong defense in the region</span>
				<span class='text'>Its capture was vital in removing the Hungarians and Croats who, following the defeats of the [[Serbs]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Albanians]] and the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], remained the only formidable force who could block further Ottoman gains in Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>Suleiman encircled [[Belgrade]] and began a series of heavy bombardments from an island in the [[Danube]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Belgrade, with a garrison of only 700 men, and receiving no aid from Hungary, fell in August 1521</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Imber, 49</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The fall of Christendom's major strongholds spread fear across Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>As the ambassador of the Holy Roman Empire to [[Constantinople]] was to note, &quot;The capture of Belgrade was at the origin of the dramatic events which engulfed Hungary</span>
				<span class='text'>It led to the death of [[Louis II of Hungary|King Louis]], the capture of [[Buda]], the occupation of [[Transylvania]], the ruin of a flourishing kingdom and the fear of neighboring nations that they would suffer the same fate&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Clot, 39</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:Semailname 47b</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|left|thumb|Suleiman as a young man]]The road to Hungary and [[Austria]] lay open, but Suleiman turned his attention instead to the Eastern [[Mediterranean]] island of [[Rhodes]], the home base of the [[Knights Hospitaller]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In the summer of 1522, taking advantage of the large navy he inherited from his father, Suleiman dispatched an armada of some 400 ships towards Rhodes, while personally leading an army of 100,000 across Asia Minor to a point opposite the island itself</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kinross, 176</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Here Suleiman built a large fortification, [[Marmaris Castle]], that served as a base for the [[Ottoman Navy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Following the brutal five-month [[Siege of Rhodes (1522)]], Rhodes capitulated and Suleiman allowed the [[Knights of Rhodes]] to depart</span>
				<span class='text'>(The Knights of Rhodes eventually formed a new base in [[Malta]], becoming known as Knights of Malta, even now</span>
				<span class='text'>As relations between Hungary and the Ottoman Empire deteriorated, Suleiman resumed his campaign in Central Europe and on 29 August 1526, he defeated [[Louis II of Hungary]] (1506–26) at the [[Battle of Mohács]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In its wake, Hungarian resistance collapsed and the Ottoman Empire became the preeminent power in Central Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kinross, 187</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Upon encountering the lifeless body of King Louis, Suleiman is said to have lamented: &quot;I came indeed in arms against him; but it was not my wish that he should be thus cut off before he scarcely tasted the sweets of life and royalty</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; While Suleiman was campaigning in Hungary, [[Yorouks|Turkmen]] tribes in central Anatolia revolted under the leadership of [[Jelali revolts|Kalender Çelebi]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ome Hungarian nobles proposed that [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]], who was ruler of neighboring [[Austria]] and tied to Louis II's family by marriage, be King of Hungary, citing previous agreements that the [[Habsburgs]] would take the Hungarian throne if Louis died without heirs</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Imber, 52</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; However, other nobles turned to the nobleman [[John Zápolya]], who was being supported by Suleiman</span>
				<span class='text'>Under [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and his brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]], the [[Habsburgs]] reoccupied [[Buda]] and took possession of Hungary</span>
				<span class='text'>Reacting in 1529, Suleiman marched through the valley of the Danube and regained control of Buda; in the following autumn his forces laid [[Siege of Vienna|siege to Vienna]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This was to be the Ottoman Empire's most ambitious expedition and the apogee of its drive to the West</span>
				<span class='text'>With a reinforced garrison of 16,000 &amp;nbsp;men,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Stephen|last=Turnbull|title=The Ottoman Empire 1326&amp;nbsp;– 1699|location=New York|publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]]|year=2003|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Austrians inflicted the first defeat on Suleiman, sowing the seeds of a bitter Ottoman-Habsburg rivalry, which lasted until the 20th century</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Imber, 50</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; His second attempt to conquer Vienna failed in 1532, with Ottoman forces delayed by the [[siege of Güns]], failing to reach Vienna</span>
				<span class='text'>In both cases, the Ottoman army was plagued by bad weather (forcing them to leave behind essential siege equipment) and was hobbled by overstretched supply lines</span>

				<span class='text'>]By the 1540s a renewal of the conflict in Hungary presented Suleiman with the opportunity to avenge the defeat suffered at Vienna</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Ferdinand and his brother Charles V were forced to conclude a humiliating five-year treaty with Suleiman</span>
				<span class='text'>Ferdinand renounced his claim to the Kingdom of Hungary and was forced to pay a fixed yearly sum to the Sultan for the Hungarian lands he continued to control</span>
				<span class='text'>Of more symbolic importance, the treaty referred to Charles V not as 'Emperor', but as the 'King of Spain', leading Suleiman to identify as the true 'Caesar'</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Imber, 54</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;With his main European rivals subdued, Suleiman ensured that the Ottoman Empire had a powerful role in the political landscape of Europe for some years to come</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|right|thumb|Miniature depicting Suleiman marching with an army in [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]], summer 1554]]As Suleiman stabilized his European frontiers, he now turned his attention to the ever present threat posed by the [[Shi'a]] [[Safavid dynasty]] of [[Persia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Two events in particular were to precipitate a recurrence of tensions</span>
				<span class='text'>First, [[Shah]] [[Tahmasp I|Tahmasp]] had the [[Baghdad]] governor loyal to Suleiman killed and replaced with an adherent of the Shah, and second, the governor of [[Bitlis]] had defected and sworn allegiance to the Safavids</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=imber51&gt;Imber, 51</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; As a result, in 1533, Suleiman ordered his [[Grand Vizier]] [[Pargalı Ibrahim Pasha]] to lead an army into eastern Asia Minor where he retook [[Bitlis]] and occupied [[Tabriz]] without resistance</span>
				<span class='text'>Having joined Ibrahim in 1534, Suleiman made a push towards Persia, only to find the Shah sacrificing territory instead of facing a pitched battle, resorting to harassment of the Ottoman army as it proceeded along the harsh interior</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=sicker206&gt;Sicker, 206</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; When in the following year Suleiman and Ibrahim made a grand entrance into [[Baghdad]], its commander surrendered the city, thereby confirming Suleiman as the leader of the [[Sunni]] Islamic world and the legitimate successor to the [[Sunni]] [[Abbasid]] [[Caliphs]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Clot, 93</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the fact Suleiman restored the grave of Sunni imam [[Abu Hanifa]] also strengthened his credentials and claim to the caliphate</span>

				<span class='text'>]Attempting to defeat the Shah once and for all, Suleiman embarked upon a second campaign in 1548–1549</span>
				<span class='text'>As in the previous attempt, Tahmasp avoided confrontation with the Ottoman army and instead chose to retreat, using [[scorched earth]] tactics in the process and exposing the Ottoman army to the harsh winter of the [[Caucasus]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Having initially lost territories in [[Erzurum]] to the Shah's son, Suleiman retaliated by recapturing Erzurum, crossing the Upper [[Euphrates]] and laying waste to parts of Persia</span>
				<span class='text'>The Shah's army continued its strategy of avoiding the Ottomans, leading to a stalemate from which neither army made any significant gain</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1554, a settlement was signed which was to conclude Suleiman's Asian campaigns</span>
				<span class='text'>Part of the treaty included and confirmed the return of Tabriz, but secured Baghdad, lower [[Mesopotamia]], the mouths of the river Euphrates and [[Tigris]], as well as part of the [[Persian Gulf]]</span>

				<span class='text'>The presence of the Spanish in the Eastern Mediterranean concerned Suleiman, who saw it as an early indication of Charles V's intention to rival Ottoman dominance in the region</span>
				<span class='text'>Recognizing the need to reassert naval preeminence in the [[Mediterranean]], Suleiman appointed an exceptional naval commander in the form of [[Hayreddin Barbarossa|Khair ad Din]], known to Europeans as [[Hayreddin Barbarossa|Barbarossa]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Once appointed admiral-in-chief, Barbarossa was charged with rebuilding the Ottoman fleet, to such an extent that the Ottoman navy equaled in number those of all other Mediterranean countries put together</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Clot, 87</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In 1535, Charles V won an important victory against the Ottomans at [[Tunis]], which together with the war against [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] the following year, led Suleiman to accept proposals from [[Francis I of France]] to form [[Franco-Ottoman alliance|an alliance against Charles]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=imber51/&gt; In 1538, the Spanish fleet was defeated by Barbarossa at the [[Battle of Preveza]], securing the eastern Mediterranean for the Turks for 33 years, until the defeat at the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Battle of Lepanto]] in 1571</span>

				<span class='text'>Barbarossa pillaged the coast of [[Naples]] and [[Sicily]] before reaching France, where Francis made [[Toulon]] the Ottoman admiral's naval headquarters</span>
				<span class='text'>The same campaign saw Barbarossa attack and [[Siege of Nice|capture Nice in 1543]]</span>

				<span class='text'>The Ottomans invaded Malta in 1565, undertaking the [[Great Siege of Malta]], which began on 18 May and lasted until 8 September, and is portrayed vividly in the frescoes of [[Matteo Perez d'Aleccio]] in the Hall of St</span>

				<span class='text'>As the historian [[Lord Kinross]] notes, &quot;Not only was he a great military campaigner, a man of the sword, as his father and great-grandfather had been before him</span>
				<span class='text'>He differed from them in the extent to which he was also a man of the pen</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a great legislator, standing out in the eyes of his people as a high-minded sovereign and a magnanimous exponent of justice&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kinross, 205</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The overriding law of the empire was the [[Shari'ah]], or Sacred Law, which as the divine law of [[Islam]] was outside of the Sultan's powers to change</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet an area of distinct law known as the ''Kanuns'' ({{lang|ota|قانون}}, canonical legislation) was dependent on Suleiman's will alone, covering areas such as criminal law, land tenure and taxation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Imber, 244</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He collected all the judgments that had been issued by the nine Ottoman Sultans who preceded him</span>
				<span class='text'>After eliminating duplications and choosing between contradictory statements, he issued a single legal code, all the while being careful not to violate the basic laws of Islam</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Greenblatt, 20</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; It was within this framework that Suleiman, supported by his [[Grand Mufti]] [[Mehmet Ebussuud el-İmadi|Ebussuud]], sought to reform the legislation to adapt to a rapidly changing empire</span>
				<span class='text'>When the Kanun laws attained their final form, the code of laws became known as the ''kanun‐i Osmani'' ({{lang|ota|قانون عثمانی}}), or the &quot;Ottoman laws&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Suleiman's legal code was to last more than three hundred years</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Greenblatt, 21</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Suleiman gave particular attention to the plight of the [[Rayah|rayas]], Christian subjects who worked the land of the [[Sipahi]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>His Kanune Raya, or &quot;Code of the Rayas&quot;, reformed the law governing levies and taxes to be paid by the rayas, raising their status above serfdom to the extent that Christian [[serfs]] would migrate to Turkish territories to benefit from the reforms</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kinross, 210</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The Sultan also played a role in protecting the Jewish subjects of his empire for centuries to come</span>
				<span class='text'>In late 1553 or 1554, on the suggestion of his favorite doctor and dentist, the Spanish Jew [[Moses Hamon]], the Sultan issued a ''[[firman (decree)|firman]]'' ({{lang|ota|فرمان}}) formally denouncing [[blood libels]] against the Jews</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Mansel, 124</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Suleiman enacted new criminal and police legislation, prescribing a set of fines for specific offenses, as well as reducing the instances requiring death or mutilation</span>
				<span class='text'>In the area of taxation, taxes were levied on various goods and produce, including animals, mines, profits of trade, and import-export duties</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition to taxes, officials who had fallen into disrepute were likely to have their land and property confiscated by the Sultan</span>
				<span class='text'>ducation was another important area for the Sultan</span>
				<span class='text'>Schools attached to mosques and funded by religious foundations provided a largely free education to Muslim boys in advance of the Christian countries of the time</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=kinross211&gt;Kinross, 211</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In his capital, Suleiman increased the number of ''mektebs''  ({{lang|ota|مكتب}}, primary schools) to fourteen, teaching boys to read and write as well as the principles of Islam</span>
				<span class='text'>Young men wishing further education could proceed to one of eight ''[[Madrasah|medreses]]''  ({{lang|ota|مدرسه}}, colleges), whose studies included grammar, metaphysics, philosophy, astronomy and astrology</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=kinross211 /&gt; Higher ''medreses'' provided education of university status, whose graduates became ''imams'' ({{lang|ota|امام}}) or teachers</span>
				<span class='text'>Educational centers were often one of many buildings surrounding the courtyards of mosques, others included libraries, refectories, fountains, soup kitchens and hospitals for the benefit of the public</span>

				<span class='text'>312&lt;/ref&gt; and when he was young was educated at the [[Palace School]] under the [[devshirme]] system</span>
				<span class='text'>Suleiman made him the royal [[Falconry|falconer]], then promoted him to first officer of the Royal Bedchamber</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Mansel, 87</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&gt;Mansel, 87</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Ibrahim Pasha rose to [[Grand Vizier]] in 1523 and commander-in-chief of all the armies</span>
				<span class='text'>Suleiman also conferred upon Ibrahim Pasha the honor of ''[[beylerbey]]'' of [[Rumelia]] (first-ranking military governor-general), granting Ibrahim authority over all Turkish territories in Europe, as well as command of troops residing within them in times of war</span>
				<span class='text'>According to a 17th-century chronicler, Ibrahim had asked Suleiman not to promote him to such high positions, fearing for his safety; to which Suleiman replied that under his reign, no matter what the circumstance, Ibrahim would never be put to death</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Clot, 49</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Yet Ibrahim eventually fell from grace with the Sultan</span>
				<span class='text'>During his thirteen years as Grand Vizier, his rapid rise to power and vast accumulation of wealth had made Ibrahim many enemies at the Sultan's court</span>
				<span class='text'>Reports had reached the Sultan of Ibrahim's impudence during a campaign against the Persian Safavid empire: in particular his adoption of the title ''[[serasker]] sultan'' ({{lang|ota|سرعسكر سلطان}}) was seen as a grave affront to Suleiman</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=kinross230&gt;Kinross, 230</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Suleiman's suspicion of Ibrahim was worsened by a quarrel between the latter and the finance secretary (''[[defterdar]]'') [[Iskender Çelebi]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The dispute ended in the disgrace of Çelebi on charges of intrigue, with Ibrahim convincing Suleiman to sentence the ''defterdar'' to death</span>
				<span class='text'>Before his death however, Çelebi's last words were to accuse Ibrahim of conspiracy against the Sultan</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=kinross230 /&gt; These dying words convinced Suleiman of Ibrahim's disloyalty,&lt;ref name=kinross230/&gt; and on 15 March 1536 Ibrahim was executed</span>
				<span class='text'>= Succession ==Sultan Suleiman's two wives (Hürrem and Mahidevran) had borne him six sons, four of whom survived past the 1550s</span>
				<span class='text'>They were [[Şehzade Mustafa|Mustafa]], [[Selim II|Selim]], [[Şehzade Bayezid|Bayezid]], and [[Şehzade Cihangir|Cihangir]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Of these, only Mustafa, the eldest, was not [[Roxelana|Hürrem Sultan]]'s son, but rather [[Mahidevran Sultan]]'s, and therefore preceded Hürrem's children in the order of succession</span>
				<span class='text'>Hürrem was aware that should Mustafa become Sultan her own children would be strangled</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet Mustafa was recognized as the most talented of all the brothers and was supported by [[Pargalı İbrahim Pasha]], who was by this time Suleiman's [[Grand Vizier]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Austrian ambassador [[Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq|Busbecq]] would note &quot;Suleiman has among his children a son called Mustafa, marvelously well educated and prudent and of an age to rule, since he is 24 or 25 years old; may God never allow a Barbary of such strength to come near us&quot;, going on to talk of Mustafa's &quot;remarkable natural gifts&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Clot, 155</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Hürrem is usually held at least partly responsible for the intrigues in nominating a successor</span>
				<span class='text'>Although she was Suleiman's wife, she exercised no official public role</span>
				<span class='text'>This did not, however, prevent Hürrem from wielding powerful political influence</span>
				<span class='text'>Since the Empire lacked, until the reign of [[Ahmed I]], any formal means of nominating a successor, successions usually involved the death of competing princes in order to avert civil unrest and rebellions</span>
				<span class='text'>In attempting to avoid the execution of her sons, Hürrem used her influence to eliminate those who supported Mustafa's accession to the throne</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Mansel, 84</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;/&gt;[[File:Suleiman sequin 1520</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&gt;Mansel, 87</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Suleiman had Ibrahim murdered and replaced with her sympathetic son-in-law, [[Rüstem Pasha]]</span>
				<span class='text'>By 1552, when the campaign against Persia had begun with Rüstem appointed commander-in-chief of the expedition, intrigues against Mustafa began</span>
				<span class='text'>Rüstem sent one of Suleiman's most trusted men to report that since Suleiman was not at the head of the army, the soldiers thought the time had come to put a younger prince on the throne; at the same time he spread rumors that Mustafa had proved receptive to the idea</span>
				<span class='text'>Angered by what he came to believe were Mustafa's plans to claim the throne, the following summer upon return from his campaign in Persia, Suleiman summoned him to his tent in the [[Ereğli, Konya|Ereğli valley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Tahsin|last=Ünal|publisher=Anıt|issue=28|title=The Execution of Prince Mustafa in Eregli|year=1961|pages=9–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating he would &quot;be able to clear himself of the crimes he was accused of and would have nothing to fear if he came&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|190px|Distribution of rewards after the [[Battle of Szigetvár|siege of Szigetvár]]]]Mustafa was confronted with a choice: either he appeared before his father at the risk of being killed; or, if he refused to attend, he would be accused of betrayal</span>
				<span class='text'>In the end, Mustafa chose to enter his father's tent, confident that the support of the army would protect him</span>
				<span class='text'>Busbecq, who claims to have received an account from an eyewitness, describes Mustafa's final moments</span>
				<span class='text'>As Mustafa entered his father's tent, Suleiman's [[eunuch]]s attacked Mustafa, with the young prince putting up a brave defence</span>
				<span class='text'>Suleiman, separated from the struggle only by the linen hangings of the tent, peered through the chamber of his tent and &quot;directed fierce and threatening glances upon the mutes, and by menacing gestures sternly rebuked their hesitation</span>
				<span class='text'>Thereupon, the mutes in their alarm, redoubling their efforts, hurled Mustafa to the ground and, throwing the bowstring round his neck, strangled him</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kinross, 239</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Mansel89&gt;Mansel, 89</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The two surviving brothers, [[Selim II|Selim]] and [[Şehzade Bayezid|Bayezid]], were given command in different parts of the empire</span>
				<span class='text'>Within a few years, however, civil war broke out between the brothers, each supported by his loyal forces</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kinross, 240</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; With the aid of his father's army, Selim defeated Bayezid in [[Konya]] in 1559, leading the latter to seek refuge with the [[Safavids]] along with his four sons</span>
				<span class='text'>Following diplomatic exchanges, the Sultan demanded from the [[Tahmasp I|Safavid Shah]] that Bayezid be either extradited or executed</span>
				<span class='text'>In return for large amounts of gold, the Shah allowed a Turkish executioner to strangle Bayezid and his four sons in 1561,&lt;ref name=Mansel89/&gt; clearing the path for Selim's succession to the throne seven years later</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and the Grand Vizier kept his death secret during the retreat for the intronisation of Selim II</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Clot, 298</span>

				<span class='text'>His expansion into Europe had given the Ottoman Turks a powerful presence in the European balance of power</span>
				<span class='text'>Indeed, such was the perceived threat of the Ottoman Empire under the reign of Suleiman that Austria's ambassador [[Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq|Busbecq]] warned of Europe's imminent conquest: &quot;On [the Turks'] side are the resources of a mighty empire, strength unimpaired, habituation to victory, endurance of toil, unity, discipline, frugality and watchfulness&amp;nbsp;</span>
