				<span class='text'>16&quot;/&gt; – March 10, 1913) was an [[African-American]] [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], [[humanitarian]], and, during the [[American Civil War]], a [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] [[American Civil War spies#Union|spy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Born into [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]], Tubman escaped and subsequently made some thirteen missions to rescue approximately seventy enslaved family and friends,&lt;ref name=&quot;13-70&quot;&gt;Larson, p</span>
				<span class='text'>xvii</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; using the network of antislavery activists and safe houses known as the [[Underground Railroad]]</span>
				<span class='text'>She later helped abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] recruit men for [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry|his raid]] on [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry]], and in the post-war era was an active participant in the struggle for [[women's suffrage]]</span>
				<span class='text'>orn a slave in [[Dorchester County, Maryland]], Tubman was beaten and whipped by her various masters as a child</span>
				<span class='text'>Early in life, she suffered a traumatic head wound when an irate slave owner threw a heavy metal weight intending to hit another slave and hit her instead</span>
				<span class='text'>The injury caused dizziness, pain, and spells of [[hypersomnia]], which occurred throughout her life</span>
				<span class='text'>She was a devout [[Christian]] and experienced strange visions and vivid dreams, which she ascribed to premonitions from God</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1849, Tubman escaped to [[Philadelphia]], then immediately returned to Maryland to rescue her family</span>
				<span class='text'>Slowly, one group at a time, she brought relatives with her out of the state, and eventually guided dozens of other slaves to freedom</span>
				<span class='text'>Traveling by night and in extreme secrecy, Tubman (or &quot;Moses&quot;, as she was called) &quot;never lost a passenger&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Her actions made slave owners anxious and angry, and they posted rewards for her capture</span>
				<span class='text'>When a far-reaching United States [[Fugitive Slave Law]] was passed in 1850, she helped guide fugitives further north into [[Canada]], and helped newly freed slaves find work</span>
				<span class='text'>hen the US Civil War began, Tubman worked for the Union Army, first as a cook and nurse, and then as an armed scout and spy</span>
				<span class='text'>The first woman to lead an armed expedition in the war, she guided the [[raid at Combahee Ferry]], which liberated more than seven hundred slaves</span>
				<span class='text'>After the war, she retired to the family home on property she had purchased in 1859 in [[Auburn, New York]], where she cared for her aging parents</span>
				<span class='text'>She was active in the [[women's suffrage]] movement until illness overtook her and she had to be admitted to a home for elderly African-Americans that she had helped to establish years earlier</span>
				<span class='text'>After she died in 1913, she became an icon of American courage and freedom</span>
				<span class='text'>=Early life and education==Tubman was born Araminta &quot;Minty&quot; Ross to slave parents, Harriet (&quot;Rit&quot;) Green and Ben Ross</span>
				<span class='text'>Rit was owned by Mary Pattison Brodess (and later her son Edward)</span>
				<span class='text'>Ben was held by Anthony Thompson, who became Mary's second husband, and who ran a large [[plantation]] near [[Blackwater River (Maryland)|Blackwater River]] in [[Madison, Maryland]]</span>
				<span class='text'>As with many slaves in the United States, neither the exact year nor place of Araminta's birth is known, and historians differ as to the best estimate</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Kate Larson]] records the year as 1822, based on a midwife payment and several other historical documents, including her runaway advertisement,&lt;ref name=&quot;Larson, p</span>
				<span class='text'>16&quot;&gt;Larson, p</span>
				<span class='text'>16</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; while Jean Humez says &quot;the best current evidence suggests that Tubman was born in 1820, but it might have been a year or two later</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Humez&quot;&gt;Humez, p</span>
				<span class='text'>12</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; [[Catherine Clinton]] notes that Tubman reported the year of her birth as 1825, while her death certificate lists 1815 and her gravestone lists 1820</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Clinton, p</span>
				<span class='text'>4</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In her Civil War [[widow's pension]] records, Tubman claimed she was born in 1820, 1822, and 1825, an indication, perhaps, that she had only a general idea of when she was born</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Harriet Tubman Locations Map</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|A map showing key locations in Tubman's life]]Modesty, Tubman's maternal grandmother, arrived in the United States on a slave ship from Africa; no information is available about her other ancestors</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Clinton, p</span>
				<span class='text'>5</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; As a child, Tubman was told that she was of [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] lineage (from what is now [[Ghana]]), though no evidence exists to confirm or deny this assertion</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Lar10&quot;&gt;Larson, p</span>
				<span class='text'>10</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Her mother Rit (who may have had a white father)&lt;ref name=&quot;Lar10&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clinton, p</span>
				<span class='text'>6</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; was a cook for the Brodess family</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Humez&quot; /&gt; Her father Ben was a skilled woodsman who managed the timber work on Thompson's plantation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Lar10&quot; /&gt; They married around 1808 and, according to court records, they had nine children together: Linah, Mariah Ritty, Soph, Robert, Minty (Harriet), Ben, Rachel, Henry, and Moses</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Larson, p</span>
				<span class='text'>311-312</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Rit struggled to keep her family together as slavery threatened to tear it apart</span>
				<span class='text'>Edward Brodess sold three of her daughters (Linah, Mariah Ritty, and Soph), separating them from the family forever</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Clinton, p</span>
				<span class='text'>10&lt;/ref&gt; When a trader from Georgia approached Brodess about buying Rit's youngest son, Moses, she hid him for a month, aided by other slaves and [[free negro|free blacks]] in the community</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Larson, p</span>
				<span class='text'>34</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; At one point she confronted her owner about the sale</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Lar33&quot;&gt;Larson, p</span>
				<span class='text'>33</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Brodess and &quot;the Georgia man&quot; came toward the slave quarters to seize the child, where Rit told them, &quot;You are after my son; but the first man that comes into my house, I will split his head open</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lar33&quot; /&gt; Brodess backed away and abandoned the sale</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Cli13&quot;&gt;Clinton, p</span>
				<span class='text'>13</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Tubman's biographers agree that stories told about this event within the family influenced her belief in the possibilities of resistance</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Cli13&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Humez, p</span>
				<span class='text'>14</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Childhood==Tubman's mother was assigned to &quot;the big house&quot; and had scarce time for her family; consequently, as a child Tubman took care of a younger brother and baby, as was typical in large families</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Humez, p</span>
				<span class='text'>13</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; When she was five or six years old, Brodess hired her out as a nursemaid to a woman named &quot;Miss Susan</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; She was ordered to keep watch on the baby as it slept; when it woke up and cried, she was whipped</span>
				<span class='text'>She later recounted a particular day when she was lashed five times before breakfast</span>
				<span class='text'>She carried the scars for the rest of her life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Clinton, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>17–18</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; She found ways to resist, running away for five days,&lt;ref&gt;Larson, p</span>
				<span class='text'>40</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; wearing layers of clothing as protection against beatings, and fighting back</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Cli19&quot;&gt;Clinton, p</span>
				<span class='text'>19</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;As a child, Tubman also worked at the home of a [[planter (plantation owner)|planter]] named James Cook</span>
				<span class='text'>She had to check the [[muskrat]] traps in nearby marshes, even after contracting [[measles]]</span>
				<span class='text'>She became so ill that Cook sent her back to Brodess, where her mother nursed her back to health</span>
				<span class='text'>Brodess then hired her out again</span>
				<span class='text'>She spoke later of her acute childhood [[homesickness]], comparing herself to &quot;the boy on the [[Suwannee River|Swanee River]],&quot; an allusion to [[Stephen Foster]]'s song &quot;[[Old Folks at Home]]</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lar38&quot;&gt;Larson, p</span>
				<span class='text'>38</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; As she grew older and stronger, she was assigned to field and forest work, driving oxen, plowing, and hauling logs</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Larson, p</span>
				<span class='text'>56</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Head injury===As a child in [[Dorchester County, Maryland|Dorchester County]], [[Maryland]], Tubman was beaten by masters to whom she was hired out</span>
				<span class='text'>Early in her life, she suffered a severe [[Head injury|head wound]] when hit by a heavy metal weight</span>
				<span class='text'>The injury caused disabling epileptic seizures, [[headache]]s, powerful visions, and dream experiences, which occurred throughout her life</span>
				<span class='text'>A devout [[Christian]], Tubman ascribed the [[Vision (spirituality)|visions]] and vivid dreams to [[revelation]]s from God</span>
				<span class='text'>ne day, the adolescent Tubman was sent to a dry-goods store for supplies</span>
				<span class='text'>There, she encountered a slave owned by another family, who had left the fields without permission</span>
				<span class='text'>His overseer, furious, demanded that she help restrain him</span>
				<span class='text'>She refused, and as he ran away, the overseer threw a two-pound weight at him</span>
				<span class='text'>He struck her instead, which she said &quot;broke my skull</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; She later explained her belief that her hair – which &quot;had never been combed and&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;stood out like a bushel basket&quot; – might have saved her life</span>
				<span class='text'>Bleeding and unconscious, she was returned to her owner's house and laid on the seat of a loom, where she remained without medical care for two days</span>
				<span class='text'>She was sent back into the fields, &quot;with blood and sweat rolling down my face until I couldn't see</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lar42&quot;&gt;Larson, p</span>
				<span class='text'>42</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Her boss said she was &quot;not worth a sixpence&quot; and returned her to Brodess, who tried unsuccessfully to sell her</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Cli22&quot;&gt;Clinton, p</span>
				<span class='text'>22</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; She began having seizures and would seemingly fall unconscious, although she claimed to be aware of her surroundings while appearing to be asleep</span>
				<span class='text'>These episodes were alarming to her family, who were unable to wake her when she fell asleep suddenly and without warning</span>
				<span class='text'>This condition remained with her for the rest of her life; Larson suggests she may have suffered from [[temporal lobe epilepsy]] as a result of the injury</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Larson, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>42–43</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The severe head wound occurred when Tubman was becoming deeply religious—although one must note this is not insinuating this as being the chief cause</span>
				<span class='text'>As an illiterate child, she had been told [[Bible]] stories by her mother</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Clinton, p</span>
				<span class='text'>20</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The particular variety of her early [[Christian]] belief remains unclear, but she acquired a passionate faith in God</span>
				<span class='text'>She rejected the teachings of the [[New Testament]] that urged slaves to be obedient and found guidance in the [[Old Testament]] tales of deliverance</span>
				<span class='text'>Additionally, she began having visions and potent dreams, which she considered signs from the divine</span>
				<span class='text'>This religious perspective instructed her throughout her life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Larson, p</span>
				<span class='text'>47</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Family and marriage==By 1840, Tubman's father, Ben, was [[manumitted]] from slavery at the age of 45, as stipulated in a former owner's [[will (law)|will]], though his actual age was closer to 55</span>
				<span class='text'>He continued working as a timber estimator and foreman for the Thompson family, who had held him as a slave</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Clinton, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>23–24</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Several years later, Tubman contacted a white attorney and paid him five dollars to investigate her mother's legal status</span>
				<span class='text'>The lawyer discovered that a former owner had issued instructions that Rit, like her husband, would be manumitted at the age of 45</span>
				<span class='text'>The record showed that a similar provision would apply to Rit's children, and that any children born after she reached 45 years of age were legally free, but the Pattison and Brodess families had ignored this stipulation when they inherited the slaves</span>
				<span class='text'>Challenging it legally was an impossible task for Tubman</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Clinton, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>28–29</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Around 1844, she married a free black man named John Tubman</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Lar62&quot;&gt;Larson, p</span>
				<span class='text'>62</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Although little is known about him or their time together, the union was complicated because of her slave status</span>
				<span class='text'>Since [[Partus sequitur ventrum|the mother's status]] dictated that of children, any children born to Harriet and John would be enslaved</span>
				<span class='text'>Such blended marriages – [[free people of color]] marrying enslaved people – were not uncommon on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, where by this time, half the black population was free</span>
				<span class='text'>Most African-American families had both free and enslaved members</span>
				<span class='text'>Larson suggests that they might have planned to buy Tubman's freedom</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Larson, p</span>
				<span class='text'>63</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Tubman changed her name from Araminta to Harriet soon after her marriage, though the exact timing is unclear</span>
				<span class='text'>Larson suggests this happened right after the wedding,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lar62&quot; /&gt; and Clinton suggests that it coincided with Tubman's plans to escape from slavery</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Cli33&quot;&gt;Clinton, p</span>
				<span class='text'>33</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; She adopted her mother's name, possibly as part of a religious conversion, or to honor another relative</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Lar62&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cli33&quot; /&gt;==Escape from slavery==In 1849, Tubman became ill again, and her value as a slave was diminished as a result</span>
				<span class='text'>Edward Brodess tried to sell her, but could not find a buyer</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Larson, p</span>
				<span class='text'>72</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Angry at his action and the unjust hold he kept on her relatives, Tubman began to pray for her owner, asking God to make him change his ways</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Clinton, p</span>
				<span class='text'>31</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I prayed all night long for my master,&quot; she said later, &quot;till the first of March; and all the time he was bringing people to look at me, and trying to sell me</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; When it appeared as though a sale was being concluded, she switched tactics</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;I changed my prayer,&quot; she said</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;First of March I began to pray, 'Oh Lord, if you ain't never going to change that man's heart, kill him, Lord, and take him out of the way</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;QBra14-15&quot;&gt;Quoted in Bradford (1971), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>14–15</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;A week later, Brodess died, and Tubman expressed regret for her earlier sentiments</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Larson, p</span>
				<span class='text'>73</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;As in many estate settlements, Brodess's death increased the likelihood of Tubman being sold and her family being broken apart;&lt;ref&gt;Clinton, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>31–32</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; his widow, Eliza, began working to sell the family's slaves</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Larson, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>74–77</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Tubman refused to wait for the Brodess family to decide her fate, despite her husband's efforts to dissuade her</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Larson, p</span>
				<span class='text'>77</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[T]here was one of two things I had a right to,&quot; she explained later, &quot;liberty or death; if I could not have one, I would have the other</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Bradford (1961), p</span>
				<span class='text'>29</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Harriet Tubman Reward Notice 1849</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|300px|Notice published in the ''Cambridge Democrat'' newspaper, offering a three hundred dollar reward for capture of the escaped slaves &quot;Minty&quot; (Harriet Tubman) and her brothers Henry and Ben]]Tubman and her brothers, Ben and Henry, escaped from slavery on September 17, 1849</span>
				<span class='text'>Tubman had been hired out to Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Anthony Thompson, who owned a large plantation in an area called Poplar Neck in neighboring Caroline County; it is likely her brothers labored for Thompson as well</span>
				<span class='text'>Because the slaves were hired out to another household, Eliza Brodess probably did not recognize their absence as an escape attempt for some time</span>
				<span class='text'>Two weeks later, she posted a runaway notice in the [[Cambridge, Maryland|Cambridge]] ''Democrat'', offering a reward of up to 100 dollars for each slave returned</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Larson, p</span>
				<span class='text'>78</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Once they had left, Tubman's brothers had second thoughts</span>
				<span class='text'>Ben may have just become a father</span>
				<span class='text'>The two men went back, forcing Tubman to return with them</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Larson, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>78–79</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Soon afterward, Tubman escaped again, this time without her brothers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Lar80&quot;&gt;Larson, p</span>
				<span class='text'>80</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Beforehand, she tried to send word to her mother of her plans</span>
				<span class='text'>She sang a coded song to Mary, a trusted fellow slave, that was a farewell</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;I'll meet you in the morning,&quot; she intoned, &quot;I'm bound for the promised land</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;QBra19&quot;&gt;Quoted in Bradford (1971), p</span>
				<span class='text'>19</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; While her exact route is unknown, Tubman made use of the network known as the [[Underground Railroad]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This informal, but well-organized, system was composed of free and enslaved blacks, white abolitionists, and other activists</span>
				<span class='text'>Most prominent among the latter in Maryland at the time were members of the [[Religious Society of Friends]], often called Quakers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Lar80&quot; /&gt; The Preston area near Poplar Neck in Caroline County contained a substantial Quaker community, and was probably an important first stop during Tubman's escape</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Larson, p</span>
				<span class='text'>81</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; From there, she probably took a common route for fleeing slaves - northeast along the [[Choptank River]], through [[Delaware]] and then north into [[Pennsylvania]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Cli37&quot;&gt;Clinton, p</span>
				<span class='text'>37</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; A journey of nearly 90 miles (145 kilometers), her traveling by foot would have taken between five days and three weeks</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Clinton, p</span>
				<span class='text'>38</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Tubman had to travel by night, guided by the [[Polaris|North Star]], and trying to avoid slave catchers, eager to collect rewards for [[fugitive slaves]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Clinton, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>37–38</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;conductors&quot; in the Underground Railroad used deceptions for protection</span>
				<span class='text'>At an early stop, the lady of the house ordered Tubman to so sweep the yard as to seem to be working for the family</span>
				<span class='text'>When night fell, the family hid her in a cart and took her to the next friendly house</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Larson, p</span>
				<span class='text'>83</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Given her familiarity with the woods and marshes of the region, Tubman during the day likely hid in these locales</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Cli37&quot; /&gt; Tubman only later described her routes because other fugitive slaves used them</span>
				<span class='text'>articulars of her first journey remain shrouded in secrecy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Larson, p</span>
				<span class='text'>82</span>

				<span class='text'>She would travel from there northeast to Sandtown and Willow Grove, Delaware, and to the Camden area where free black agents, William and Nat Brinkley and Abraham Gibbs, guided her north past Dover, Smyrna, and Blackbird, where other agents would take her across the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal to New Castle and Wilmington</span>
				<span class='text'>In Wilmington, Quaker Thomas Garrett would secure transportation to [[William Still]]'s office or the homes of other Underground Railroad operators in the greater Philadelphia area</span>

				<span class='text'>ng|thumb|right|[[Frederick Douglass]], who worked for slavery's [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition]] alongside Tubman,  praised her in print]]Because the Fugitive Slave Law had made the northern United States a more dangerous place for escaped slaves to remain, many escaped slaves began migrating to Southern Ontario</span>
				<span class='text'>In December 1851, Tubman guided an unidentified group of 11 fugitives, possibly including the Bowleys and several others she had helped rescue earlier, northward</span>
				<span class='text'>There is evidence to suggest that Tubman and her group stopped at the home of abolitionist and former slave [[Frederick Douglass]]</span>

				<span class='text'>84</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In his [[Life and Times of Frederick Douglass|third autobiography]], Douglass wrote: &quot;On one occasion I had eleven fugitives at the same time under my roof, and it was necessary for them to remain with me until I could collect sufficient money to get them on to Canada</span>
				<span class='text'>It was the largest number I ever had at any one time, and I had some difficulty in providing so many with food and shelter</span>

				<span class='text'>266</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Cli84&quot; /&gt;Douglass and Tubman admired one another greatly as they both struggled against slavery</span>
				<span class='text'>When an early biography of Tubman was being prepared in 1868, Douglass wrote a letter to honor her</span>
				<span class='text'>It read in part: {{Blockquote|You ask for what you do not need when you call upon me for a word of commendation</span>
				<span class='text'>I need such words from you far more than you can need them from me, especially where your superior labors and devotion to the cause of the lately enslaved of our land are known as I know them</span>

				<span class='text'>She also provided specific instructions to 50 to 60 additional fugitives who escaped to the north</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;13-70&quot;/&gt; Tubman's dangerous work required tremendous ingenuity; she usually worked during winter months, to minimize the likelihood that the group would be seen</span>
				<span class='text'>One admirer of Tubman said: &quot;She always came in the winter, when the nights are long and dark, and people who have homes stay in them</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Clinton, p</span>
				<span class='text'>85</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Once she had made contact with escaping slaves, they left town on Saturday evenings, since newspapers would not print runaway notices until Monday morning</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Larson, p</span>
				<span class='text'>100</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;{{slavery}}Her journeys into the land of slavery put her at tremendous risk, and she used a variety of subterfuges to avoid detection</span>
				<span class='text'>Tubman once disguised herself with a [[Bonnet (headgear)|bonnet]] and carried two live [[chickens]] to give the appearance of running errands</span>
				<span class='text'>Suddenly finding herself walking toward a former owner in Dorchester County, she yanked the strings holding the birds' legs, and their agitation allowed her to avoid eye contact</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Clinton, p</span>
				<span class='text'>89</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Later she recognized a fellow train passenger as another former master; she snatched a nearby newspaper and pretended to read</span>
				<span class='text'>Since Tubman was known to be illiterate, the man ignored her</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Larson, p</span>
				<span class='text'>125</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Tubman's religious faith was another important resource as she ventured repeatedly into Maryland</span>
				<span class='text'>The visions from her childhood head injury continued, and she saw them as divine [[premonitions]]</span>
				<span class='text'>She spoke of &quot;consulting with God,&quot; and trusted that He would keep her safe</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Cli91&quot;&gt;Clinton, p</span>
				<span class='text'>91</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Garrett once said of her, &quot;I never met with any person of any color who had more confidence in the voice of God, as spoken direct to her soul</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Clinton, p</span>
				<span class='text'>91</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Her faith in the divine also provided immediate assistance</span>
				<span class='text'>She used [[Spiritual (music)|spirituals]] as coded messages, warning fellow travelers of danger or to signal a clear path</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Larson, p</span>
				<span class='text'>101</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Tubman also carried a [[revolver]], and was not afraid to use it</span>
				<span class='text'>The gun afforded some protection from the ever-present slave catchers and their dogs, however she also purportedly threatened to shoot any escaped slave who tried to turn back on the journey since that would threaten the safety of the remaining group</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Clinton, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>90–91</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Tubman told the tale of one man who insisted he was going to go back to the plantation when morale got low among a group of fugitive slaves</span>
				<span class='text'>She pointed the gun at his head and said, &quot;You go on or die</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Conrad, p</span>
				<span class='text'>14</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Several days later, he was with the group as they entered the United Province of Canada</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Cli91&quot; /&gt;Slaveholders in the region, meanwhile, never knew that &quot;Minty,&quot; the petite, five-foot-tall, disabled slave who had run away years before and never come back, was behind so many slave escapes in their community</span>
				<span class='text'>By the late 1850s, they began to suspect a northern white abolitionist was secretly enticing their slaves away</span>
				<span class='text'>They considered that [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] himself had come to the Eastern Shore to lure slaves away before his ill-fated raid on [[Harper's Ferry]] in October 1859</span>
				<span class='text'>hile a popular legend persists about a reward of US$40,000 for Tubman's capture, this is a manufactured figure</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1868, in an effort to drum up support for Tubman's claim for a Civil War military pension, a former abolitionist named Salley Holley wrote an article claiming US$40,000 &quot;was not too great a reward for Maryland slaveholders to offer for her</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Larson, p</span>
				<span class='text'>241</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Such a high reward would have garnered national attention, especially at a time when a small farm could be purchased for a mere US$400</span>
				<span class='text'>No such reward has been found in period newspapers</span>
				<span class='text'>(The federal government offered $25,000 for the capture of each of [[John Wilkes Booth]]'s co-conspirators in Lincoln's assassination</span>
				<span class='text'> A reward offering of US$12,000 has also been claimed, though no documentation exists for that figure either</span>
				<span class='text'>Catherine Clinton suggests that the US$40,000 figure may have been a combined total of the various [[Bounty (reward)|bounties]] offered around the region</span>

				<span class='text'>31&lt;/ref&gt;Despite the best efforts of the slaveholders, Tubman was never captured, and neither were the fugitives she guided</span>
				<span class='text'>Years later, she told an audience: &quot;I was conductor of the Underground Railroad for eight years, and I can say what most conductors can't say – I never ran my train off the track and I never lost a passenger</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Clinton, p</span>
				<span class='text'>192</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; One of her last missions into Maryland was to retrieve her aging parents</span>
				<span class='text'>Her father, Ben, had purchased Rit, her mother, in 1855 from Eliza Brodess for 20 dollars</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Larson, p</span>
				<span class='text'>119</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; But even when they were both free, the area became hostile to their presence</span>
				<span class='text'>Two years later, Tubman received word that her father had harbored a group of eight escaped slaves, and was at risk of arrest</span>
				<span class='text'>She traveled to the Eastern Shore and led them north to St</span>
				<span class='text'>Catharines, Ontario, where a community of former slaves (including Tubman's brothers, other relatives, and many friends) had gathered</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Like Tubman, he spoke of being called by God, and trusted the divine to protect him from the wrath of slaveholders</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|Tubman helped [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] (pictured) plan and recruit for the raid at [[Harpers Ferry]]</span>
				<span class='text'>]Thus, as he began recruiting supporters for an attack on slaveholders, Brown was joined by &quot;General Tubman,&quot; as he called her</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Cli129&quot; /&gt; Her knowledge of support networks and resources in the border states of Pennsylvania, Maryland and Delaware was invaluable to Brown and his planners</span>
				<span class='text'>Although other abolitionists like Frederick Douglass and [[William Lloyd Garrison]] did not endorse his tactics, Brown dreamed of fighting to create a new state for freed slaves, and made preparations for military action</span>
				<span class='text'>After he began the first battle, he believed, slaves would rise up and carry out a rebellion across the south</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Clinton, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>126–128</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He asked Tubman to gather former slaves then living in present-day Southern Ontario who might be willing to join his fighting force, which she did</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Larson, p</span>
				<span class='text'>159</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;On May 8, 1858, Brown held a meeting in [[Chatham-Kent, Ontario]], where he unveiled his plan for a raid on [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry, Virginia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Larson, p</span>
				<span class='text'>161</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; When word of the plan was leaked to the government, Brown put the scheme on hold and began raising funds for its eventual resumption</span>
				<span class='text'>Tubman aided him in this effort, and with more detailed plans for the assault</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Larson, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>161–166</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Tubman was busy during this time, giving talks to abolitionist audiences and tending to her relatives</span>

				<span class='text'>132</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; When the raid on Harpers Ferry took place on October 16, Tubman was not present</span>
				<span class='text'>Some historians believe she was in New York at the time, ill with fever related to her childhood head injury</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Cli132&quot; /&gt; Others propose she may have been recruiting more escaped slaves in Ontario,&lt;ref&gt;Humez, p</span>
				<span class='text'>39</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and Kate Clifford Larson suggests she may have been in Maryland, recruiting for Brown's raid or attempting to rescue more family members</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Lar174&quot;&gt;Larson, p</span>
				<span class='text'>174</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Larson also notes that Tubman may have begun sharing Frederick Douglass's doubts about the viability of the plan</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Lar174&quot; /&gt;The raid failed; Brown was convicted of [[treason]] and hanged in December</span>
				<span class='text'>His actions were seen by abolitionists as a symbol of proud resistance, carried out by a noble martyr</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Clinton, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>134–135</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Tubman herself was effusive with praise</span>

				<span class='text'>163</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The city was a hotbed of antislavery activism, and Tubman seized the opportunity to deliver her parents from the harsh Canadian winters</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>meant that escaped slaves were at risk of being returned to the south under the Fugitive Slave Law, and Tubman's siblings expressed reservations</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Catherine Clinton]] suggests that anger over the 1857 [[Dred Scott v</span>
				<span class='text'>Sandford|Dred Scott decision]] may have prompted Tubman to return to the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Cli117&quot; /&gt; Her land in Auburn became a haven for Tubman's family and friends</span>
				<span class='text'>For years, she took in relatives and boarders, offering a safe place for black Americans seeking a better life in the north</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Larson&quot; /&gt;Shortly after acquiring the Auburn property, Tubman went back to Maryland and returned with her &quot;niece,&quot; an eight-year-old light-skinned black girl named Margaret</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Cli117&quot; /&gt; The circumstances of this expedition remain clouded in mystery</span>
				<span class='text'>There is great confusion about the identity of Margaret's parents, although Tubman indicated they were free blacks</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Larson, p</span>
				<span class='text'>197</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Years later, Margaret's daughter Alice called Tubman's actions selfish, saying, &quot;she had taken the child from a sheltered good home to a place where there was nobody to care for her</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Clinton, p</span>
				<span class='text'>119</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Alice described it as a &quot;kidnapping</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Larson, p</span>
				<span class='text'>197</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;However, both Clinton and Larson present the possibility that Margaret was in fact Tubman's daughter</span>

				<span class='text'>121</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Larson, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>198–199</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Larson points out that the two shared an unusually strong bond, and argues that Tubman – knowing the pain of a child separated from her mother – would never have intentionally caused a free family to be split apart</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Larson, p</span>
				<span class='text'>199</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Clinton presents evidence of strong physical similarities, which Alice herself acknowledged</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In November 1860, Tubman conducted her last rescue mission</span>
				<span class='text'>Throughout the 1850s, Tubman had been unable to effect the escape of her sister, Rachel, and Rachel's two children, Ben and Angerine</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Clinton, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>147–149</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Butler had declared these fugitives to be &quot;[[Contraband (American Civil War)|contraband]]&quot; – property seized by northern forces – and put them to work, initially without pay, in the fort</span>

				<span class='text'>195</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Tubman hoped to offer her own expertise and skills to the Union cause, too, and soon she joined a group of Boston and Philadelphia abolitionists heading to the Hilton Head District in South Carolina</span>
				<span class='text'>She became a fixture in the camps, particularly in [[Port Royal, South Carolina]], assisting fugitives</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Larson, p</span>
				<span class='text'>204</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Tubman met with General [[David Hunter]], a strong supporter of abolition</span>
				<span class='text'>He declared all of the &quot;contrabands&quot; in the Port Royal district free, and began gathering former slaves for a regiment of black soldiers</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Lar205&quot; /&gt; Tubman condemned Lincoln's response and his general unwillingness to consider ending slavery in the U</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Conrad, p</span>
				<span class='text'>40</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;For two more years, Tubman worked for the Union forces, tending to newly liberated slaves, scouting into Confederate territory, and nursing wounded soldiers in Virginia</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; They spent the next 20 years together, and in 1874 they adopted a baby girl named Gertie</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Tubman's friends and supporters from the days of abolition, meanwhile, raised funds to support her</span>
				<span class='text'>One admirer, [[Sarah Hopkins Bradford]], wrote an authorized biography entitled ''Scenes in the Life of Harriet Tubman''</span>
				<span class='text'>The 132-page volume was published in 1869, and brought Tubman some US$1,200 in revenue</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; the book nevertheless remains an important source of information and perspective on Tubman's life</span>
				<span class='text'>Bradford released another volume in 1886 called ''Harriet, the Moses of her People'', which presented a less caustic view of slavery and the South</span>
