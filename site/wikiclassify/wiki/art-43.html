				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This expedition used two small ships, the ''Heemskerck'' and the ''[[Zeehaen]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>==Beach and Terra Australis===''Beach'' appeared on maps of the time, notably that of [[Abraham Ortelius]] of 1570 and that of [[Jan Huygen van Linschoten]] of 1596, as the northernmost part of the southern continent, the ''[[Terra Australis]]'', along with ''Locach''</span>
				<span class='text'>According to [[Marco Polo]], ''Locach'' was a kingdom where gold was “so plentiful that no one who did not see it could believe it”</span>
				<span class='text'>''Beach'' was in fact a mistranscription of ''Locach''</span>
				<span class='text'>Locach was Marco Polo’s name for the southern Thai kingdom of Lavo, or [[Lop Buri]], the “city of Lavo”, (ลพบร, after Lavo, the son of [[Rama]] in [[Hindu mythology]])</span>

				<span class='text'>80</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In Chinese ([[Cantonese]]), Lavo was pronounced “Lo-huk” (羅斛), from which Marco Polo took his rendition of the name</span>

				<span class='text'>II, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>68–9, note 2</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Kurrent|German cursive script]], “Locach” and “Boeach” look similar, and in the 1532 edition of [[The Travels of Marco Polo|Marco Polo’s ''Travels'']] his Locach was changed to ''Boëach'', later shortened to ''Beach''</span>

				<span class='text'>60</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;They seem to have drawn on the map of the world published in Florence in 1489 by [[Henricus Martellus]], in which ''provincia boëach'' appears as the southern neighbour of ''provincia ciamba''</span>
				<span class='text'>Book III of Marco Polo’s ''[[Il Milione]]'' described his journey by sea from China to India by way of [[Champa]] (= Southern Vietnam), Java (which he called ''[[Jave la Grande|Java Major]]''), Locach and Sumatra (called ''Java Minor'')</span>
				<span class='text'>After a chapter describing the kingdom of Champa there follows a chapter describing [[Java]] (which he did not visit himself)</span>

				<span class='text'>40: cap</span>
				<span class='text'>clxiii, &quot;La grant isle de Java&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The narrative then resumes, describing the route southward from Champa toward [[Sumatra]], but by a slip of the pen the name “Java” was substituted for “Champa” as the point of departure, locating Sumatra 1,300 miles to the south of Java instead of Champa</span>
				<span class='text'>Locach, located between Champa and Sumatra, was likewise misplaced far to the south of Java, by some geographers on or near an extension of the ''Terra Australis''</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;As explained by Sir [[Henry Yule]], the editor of an English edition of Marco Polo’s ''Travels'': “Some geographers of the 16th century, following the old editions which carried the travellers south-east of Java to the land of “Boeach” (or Locac), introduced in their maps a continent in that situation”</span>

				<span class='text'>76–280</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerard Mercator]] did just that on his 1541 globe, placing ''Beach provincia aurifera'' (“Beach the gold-bearing province”) in the northernmost part of the ''Terra Australis'' in accordance with the faulty text of Marco Polo’s ''Travels''</span>
				<span class='text'>t remained  in this location on his world  map of 1569, with the amplified description, quoting Marco Polo, ''Beach provincia aurifera quam pauci ex alienis regionibus adeunt propter gentis inhumanitatem'' (“Beach the gold-bearing province, wither few go from other countries because of the inhumanity of its people”) with ''Lucach regnum'' shown somewhat to its south west</span>

				<span class='text'>4, plate 2</span>
				<span class='text'>4</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Following Mercator, [[Abraham Ortelius]] also showed ''BEACH'' and ''LVCACH'' in these locations on his world map of 1571</span>
				<span class='text'>Likewise, Linschoten’s very popular 1596 map of the East Indies showed ''BEACH'' projecting from the map’s southern edge, leading (or misleading) Visscher and Tasman in their voyage of 1642 to seek Beach with its plentiful gold in a location to the south of the [[Solomon Islands]] somewhere between [[Staten Land]] near [[Cape Horn]] and the [[Cape of Good Hope]]</span>

				<span class='text'>5</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Confirmation that land existed where the maps showed ''Beach'' to be had come from [[Dirk Hartog]]’s landing in October 1616 on its west coast, which he called [[Eendrachtsland]] after the name of his ship</span>
