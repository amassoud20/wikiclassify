				<span class='text'>The reason for this was the crew could be fed well on the island there was plenty of fresh water and timber to repair the ships</span>
				<span class='text'>Tasman got the assistance of the governor </span>
				<span class='text'>Because of the prevailing winds Mauritius was chosen as a turning point</span>
				<span class='text'>After a four week stay on the island both ships left on 8 October using the  to sail east as fast as possible</span>

				<span class='text'>Proceeding south he skirted the southern end of Tasmania and turned north east Tasman then tried to work his two ships into  on the east coast of  where he was blown out to sea by a storm this area he named </span>
				<span class='text'>Two days later Tasman anchored to the North of Cape Frederick Hendrick just North of the </span>
				<span class='text'>Tasman then landed in Blackman Bay – in the larger </span>
				<span class='text'>The next day an attempt was made to land in North Bay however because the sea was too rough the carpenter swam through the surf and planted the Dutch flag in North Bay</span>
				<span class='text'>Tasman then claimed formal possession of the land on 3 December 1642</span>
				<span class='text'>fter some exploration Tasman had intended to proceed in a northerly direction but as the wind was unfavourable he steered east</span>
				<span class='text'>Tasman endured a very rough journey from Tasmania to New Zealand</span>
				<span class='text'>In one of his diary entries Tasman credits his compass claiming it was the only thing that kept him alive</span>
				<span class='text'>On 13 December they sighted land on the north west coast of the  New Zealand becoming the first Europeans to do so</span>
				<span class='text'> Tasman named it Staten Landt on the assumption that it was connected to an island  at the south of the tip of South America</span>
				<span class='text'>He sailed north then east and 5 days later  anchored about 7ampnbspkm from the coast</span>
				<span class='text'>He sent ships boats to gather water but one of his boats was attacked by  in a double hulled  canoe and four of his men were attacked and killed by </span>

				<span class='text'>n route back to Batavia Tasman came across the n archipelago on 20 January 1643</span>
				<span class='text'>While passing the  Tasmans ships came close to being wrecked on the dangerous reefs of the north eastern part of the Fiji group</span>
				<span class='text'>He charted the eastern tip of  and  before making his way back into the open sea</span>
				<span class='text'>He eventually turned north west to  and arrived at Batavia on 15 June 1643</span>
				<span class='text'>Second Pacific voyage With three ships on his second voyage Limmen Zeemeeuw and the tender Braek in 1644 he followed the south coast of New Guinea eastwards</span>
				<span class='text'>He missed the  between New Guinea and Australia and continued his voyage westwards along the north Australian coast</span>
				<span class='text'>He mapped the north coast of Australia making observations on the land called  and its people</span>
				<span class='text'>rom the point of view of the  Tasmans explorations were a disappointment he had neither found a promising area for trade nor a useful new shipping route</span>
				<span class='text'>Although received modestly the company was upset to a degree that Tasman didnt fully explore the lands he found and decided that a more persistent explorer should be chosen for any future expeditions</span>
				<span class='text'>  For over a century until the era of  Tasmania and New Zealand were not visited by Europeans – mainland Australia was visited but usually only by accident</span>
				<span class='text'>Later life On 2 November 1644 Abel Tasman was appointed a member of the Council of Justice at Batavia</span>
				<span class='text'>He went to Sumatra in 1646 and in August 1647 to Siam now  with letters from the company to the King</span>
				<span class='text'>In May 1648 he was in charge of an expedition sent to  to try to intercept and loot the Spanish silver ships coming from America but he had no success and returned to Batavia in January 1649</span>
				<span class='text'>In November 1649 he was charged and found guilty of having in the previous year hanged one of his men without trial was suspended from his office of commander fined and made to pay compensation to the relatives of the sailor</span>
				<span class='text'>On 5 January 1651 he was formally reinstated in his rank and spent his remaining years at Batavia</span>
				<span class='text'>He was in good circumstances being one of the larger landowners in the town</span>
				<span class='text'>He died at Batavia on 10 October 1659 and was survived by his second wife and a daughter by his first wife</span>
