				<span class='text'>Please don't add new information or details here, but instead at the main article [[William Shakespeare's life]]! --&gt;{{Main|Shakespeare's life}}===Early life===William Shakespeare was the son of [[John Shakespeare]], an [[alderman]] and a successful glover originally from [[Snitterfield]], and [[Mary Shakespeare|Mary Arden]], the daughter of an affluent landowning farmer</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1987|loc=14–22}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He was born in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] and baptised there on 26&amp;nbsp;April 1564</span>
				<span class='text'>His actual date of birth remains unknown, but is traditionally observed on 23&amp;nbsp;April, [[Saint George's Day]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1987|loc=24–6}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This date, which can be traced back to an 18th-century scholar's mistake, has proved appealing to biographers, since Shakespeare died 23&amp;nbsp;April 1616</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1987|loc=24, 296}}; {{Harvnb|Honan|1998|loc=15–16}}</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1987|loc=23–24}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Although no attendance records for the period survive, most biographers agree that Shakespeare was probably educated at the [[King Edward VI School, Stratford-upon-Avon|King's New School]] in Stratford,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1987|loc=62–63}}; {{Harvnb|Ackroyd|2006|loc=53}}; {{Harvnb|Wells|Taylor|Jowett|Montgomery|2005|loc=xv–xvi}}&lt;/ref&gt; a free school chartered in 1553,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Baldwin|1944|loc=464}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; about a quarter-mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) from his home</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Grammar school]]s varied in quality during the Elizabethan era, but grammar school curricula were largely similar: the basic [[Latin]] text was standardised by royal decree,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Baldwin|1944|loc=179–80, 183}}; {{Harvnb|Cressy|1975|loc=28, 29}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and the school would have provided an intensive education in grammar based upon Latin [[classics|classical]] authors</span>

				<span class='text'>The [[consistory court]] of the [[Anglican Diocese of Worcester|Diocese of Worcester]] issued a marriage licence on 27&amp;nbsp;November 1582</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1987|loc=93}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Twins, son [[Hamnet Shakespeare|Hamnet]] and daughter [[Judith Quiney|Judith]], followed almost two years later and were baptised 2 February 1585</span>

				<span class='text'>}]]After the birth of the twins, Shakespeare left few historical traces until he is mentioned as part of the London theatre scene in 1592</span>
				<span class='text'>The exception is the appearance of his name in the 'complaints bill' of a law case before the Queen's Bench court at Westminster dated [[Michaelmas Term]] 1588 and 9 October 1589</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1987|loc=97–108}}; {{Harvnb|Rowe|1709}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Another 18th-century story has Shakespeare starting his theatrical career minding the horses of theatre patrons in London</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1987|loc=144–45}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; [[John Aubrey]] reported that Shakespeare had been a country schoolmaster</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1987|loc=110–11}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Some 20th-century scholars have suggested that Shakespeare may have been employed as a schoolmaster by Alexander Hoghton of [[Lancashire]], a Catholic landowner who named a certain &quot;William Shakeshafte&quot; in his will</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Honigmann|1999|loc=1}}; {{Harvnb|Wells|Taylor|Jowett|Montgomery|2005|loc=xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little evidence substantiates such stories other than [[wikt:hearsay|hearsay]] collected after his death, and Shakeshafte was a common name in the Lancashire area</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chambers|1930|loc=Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>1: 287, 292}}&lt;/ref&gt; By then, he was sufficiently known in London to be attacked in print by the playwright [[Robert Greene (dramatist)|Robert Greene]] in his ''[[Greene's Groats-Worth of Wit|Groats-Worth of Wit]]'':&lt;blockquote&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;there is an upstart Crow, beautified with our feathers, that with his ''Tiger's heart wrapped in a Player's hide'', supposes he is as well able to bombast out a blank verse as the best of you: and being an absolute ''Johannes factotum'', is in his own conceit the only Shake-scene in a country</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greenblatt|2005|loc=213}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Scholars differ on the exact meaning of Greene's words,&lt;ref name=SG213&gt;{{Harvnb|Greenblatt|2005|loc=213}}; {{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1987|loc=153}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; but most agree that Greene is accusing Shakespeare of reaching above his rank in trying to match such university-educated writers as [[Christopher Marlowe]], [[Thomas Nashe]] and Greene himself (the so-called [[University Wits|&quot;university wits&quot;]])</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ackroyd|2006|loc=176}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The italicised phrase parodying the line &quot;Oh, tiger's heart wrapped in a woman's hide&quot; from Shakespeare's ''[[Henry VI, Part 3]]'', along with the pun &quot;Shake-scene&quot;, clearly identify Shakespeare as Greene's target</span>
				<span class='text'>As used here, ''[[Jack of all trades, master of none|Johannes Factotum]]'' (&quot;Jack of all trades&quot;) refers to a second-rate tinkerer with the work of others, rather than the more common &quot;universal genius&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Biographers suggest that his career may have begun any time from the mid-1580s, to just before Greene's remarks</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wells|2006|loc=28}}; {{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1987|loc=144–46}}; {{Harvnb|Chambers|1930|loc=Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>1: 59}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; After 1594, Shakespeare's plays were performed only by the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]], a company owned by a group of players, including Shakespeare, that soon became the leading [[playing company]] in London</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1987|loc=184}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; After the death of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] in 1603, the company was awarded a royal patent by the new [[James I of England|King James I]], and changed its name to [[King's Men (playing company)|the King's Men]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chambers|1923|loc=208–209}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In 1599, a partnership of members of the company built their own theatre on the south bank of the [[River Thames]], which they named the [[Globe Theatre|Globe]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1608, the partnership also took over the [[Blackfriars Theatre|Blackfriars indoor theatre]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Extant records of Shakespeare's property purchases and investments indicate that his association with the company made him a wealthy man,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chambers|1930|loc=Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>2: 67–71}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and in 1597 he bought the second-largest house in Stratford, [[New Place]], and in 1605, invested in a share of the parish [[tithes]] in Stratford</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bentley|1961|loc=36}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Some of Shakespeare's plays were published in [[Quarto (binding)|quarto]] editions beginning in 1594, and by 1598, his name had become a selling point and began to appear on the [[title page]]s</span>

				<span class='text'>The 1616 edition of [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''Works'' names him on the cast lists for ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]'' (1598) and ''[[Sejanus His Fall]]'' (1603)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Adams|1923|loc=275}}&lt;/ref&gt; The absence of his name from the 1605 cast list for Jonson's ''[[Volpone]]'' is taken by some scholars as a sign that his acting career was nearing its end</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wells|2006|loc=28}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The [[First Folio]] of 1623, however, lists Shakespeare as one of &quot;the Principal Actors in all these Plays&quot;, some of which were first staged after ''Volpone'', although we cannot know for certain which roles he played</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1987|loc=200}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In 1610, [[John Davies of Hereford]] wrote that &quot;good Will&quot; played &quot;kingly&quot; roles</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1987|loc=200–201}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In 1709, Rowe passed down a tradition that Shakespeare played the ghost of Hamlet's father</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rowe|1709}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Later traditions maintain that he also played Adam in ''[[As You Like It]]'', and the Chorus in ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ackroyd|2006|loc=357}}; {{Harvnb|Wells|Taylor|Jowett|Montgomery|2005|loc=xxii}}&lt;/ref&gt; though scholars doubt the sources of that information</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Throughout his career, Shakespeare divided his time between London and Stratford</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1596, the year before he bought New Place as his family home in Stratford, Shakespeare was living in the parish of St</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bradley|1991|loc=86}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The plots of Shakespeare's tragedies often hinge on such fatal errors or flaws, which overturn order and destroy the hero and those he loves</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bradley|1991|loc=40, 48}}</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[King Lear]]'', the old king commits the tragic error of giving up his powers, initiating the events which lead to the torture and blinding of the Earl of Gloucester and the murder of Lear's youngest daughter Cordelia</span>
				<span class='text'>According to the critic Frank Kermode, &quot;the play-offers neither its good characters nor its audience any relief from its cruelty&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In his final period, Shakespeare turned to [[Shakespeare's late romances|romance]] or [[tragicomedy]] and completed three more major plays: ''[[Cymbeline]]'', ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'' and ''[[The Tempest]]'', as well as the collaboration, ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Less bleak than the tragedies, these four plays are graver in tone than the comedies of the 1590s, but they end with reconciliation and the forgiveness of potentially tragic errors</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clemen|2005a|loc=150}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The poetry depends on extended, sometimes elaborate metaphors and conceits, and the language is often rhetorical—written for actors to declaim rather than speak</span>
				<span class='text'>The grand speeches in ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'', in the view of some critics, often hold up the action, for example; and the verse in ''[[The Two Gentlemen of Verona]]'' has been described as stilted</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Soon, however, Shakespeare began to adapt the traditional styles to his own purposes</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clemen|2005b|loc=63}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; By the time of ''Romeo and Juliet'', ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'', and ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' in the mid-1590s, Shakespeare had begun to write a more natural poetry</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|de Sélincourt|1909|loc=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]Shakespeare's standard poetic form was [[blank verse]], composed in [[iambic pentameter]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In practice, this meant that his verse was usually unrhymed and consisted of ten syllables to a line, spoken with a stress on every second syllable</span>
				<span class='text'>The blank verse of his early plays is quite different from that of his later ones</span>
				<span class='text'>It is often beautiful, but its sentences tend to start, pause, and finish at the [[End-stopping|end of lines]], with the risk of monotony</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Frye|2005|loc=185}}</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In the last phase of his career, Shakespeare adopted many techniques to achieve these effects</span>
