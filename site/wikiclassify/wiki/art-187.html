				<span class='text'>=Sailing career==At age 23, Drake made his first voyage to the [[Americas]], sailing with his second cousin, Sir [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|John Hawkins]], on one of a fleet of ships owned by his relatives, the Hawkins family of [[Plymouth]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1568 Drake was again with the Hawkins fleet when it was trapped by the Spaniards in the Mexican port of [[Battle of San Juan de Ulúa (1568)|San Juan de Ulúa]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He escaped along with Hawkins</span>
				<span class='text'>ollowing the defeat at San Juan de Ulúa, Drake vowed revenge</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=January 2014}}  He made two voyages to the [[West Indies]], in 1570 and 1571, of which little is known</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1572, he embarked on his first major independent enterprise</span>
				<span class='text'>He planned an attack on the [[Isthmus of Panama]], known to the Spanish as [[Tierra Firma|Tierra Firme]] and the English as the [[Spanish Main]]</span>
				<span class='text'> This was the point at which the silver and gold treasure of [[Peru]] had to be landed and sent overland to the [[Caribbean Sea]], where galleons from [[Spain]] would pick it up at the town of [[Nombre de Dios, Colón|Nombre de Dios]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Drake left Plymouth on 24 May 1572, with a crew of 73 men in two small vessels, the ''Pascha'' (70 tons) and the ''Swan'' (25 tons), to capture Nombre de Dios</span>
				<span class='text'>is first raid was late in July 1572</span>
				<span class='text'> Drake and his men captured the town and its treasure</span>
				<span class='text'> When his men noticed that Drake was bleeding profusely from a wound, they insisted on withdrawing to save his life and left the treasure</span>
				<span class='text'> Drake stayed in the area for almost a year, raiding Spanish shipping and attempting to capture a treasure shipment</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1573, he joined [[Guillaume Le Testu]], a French buccaneer, in an attack on a richly laden mule train</span>
				<span class='text'>Drake and his party found that they had captured around 20 tons of silver and gold</span>
				<span class='text'> They buried much of the treasure, as it was too much for their party to carry</span>
				<span class='text'>(An account of this may have given rise to subsequent stories of pirates and buried treasure</span>
				<span class='text'> Wounded, Le Testu was captured and later beheaded</span>
				<span class='text'> The small band of adventurers dragged as much gold and silver as they could carry back across some 18 miles of jungle-covered mountains to where they had left the raiding boats</span>
				<span class='text'>When they got to the coast, the boats were gone</span>
				<span class='text'>Drake and his men, downhearted, exhausted and hungry, had nowhere to go and the Spanish were not far behind</span>
				<span class='text'>t this point Drake rallied his men, buried the treasure on the beach, and built a raft to sail with two volunteers ten miles along the surf-lashed coast to where they had left the flagship</span>
				<span class='text'> When Drake finally reached its deck, his men were alarmed at his bedraggled appearance</span>
				<span class='text'> Fearing the worst, they asked him how the raid had gone</span>
				<span class='text'>Drake could not resist a joke and teased them by looking downhearted</span>
				<span class='text'>Then he laughed, pulled a necklace of Spanish gold from around his neck and said &quot;Our voyage is made, lads!&quot; By 9 August 1573, he had returned to Plymouth</span>

				<span class='text'>[[Drake's Bay]] is south of [[Cape Mendocino]]</span>
				<span class='text'>]With the success of the Panama isthmus raid, in 1577 [[Elizabeth I of England]] sent Drake to start an expedition against the Spanish along the [[Pacific]] coast of the Americas</span>
				<span class='text'>Drake used the Plans that Sir Richard Greynvile had received the Patent for in 1574 from Elizabeth, which was rescinded a year later after protests from Philip of Spain</span>
				<span class='text'>He set out from Plymouth on 15 November 1577, but bad weather threatened him and his fleet</span>
				<span class='text'> They were forced to take refuge in [[Falmouth, Cornwall]], from where they returned to Plymouth for repair</span>
				<span class='text'>fter this major setback, he set sail again on 13 December, aboard  ''[[Golden Hind|Pelican]]'', with four other ships and 164 men</span>
				<span class='text'>He soon added a sixth ship, ''Mary'' (formerly ''Santa Maria''), a Portuguese merchant ship that had been captured off the coast of Africa near the [[Portuguese Cape Verde|Cape Verde Islands]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also added its captain, Nuno da Silva, a man with considerable experience navigating in South American waters</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Sfec goldenhind02crop</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|200px|A replica of the ''[[Golden Hind]]'']]Drake's fleet suffered great attrition; he scuttled both ''Christopher'' and the [[flyboat]] ''Swan'' due to loss of men on the Atlantic crossing</span>
				<span class='text'>He made landfall at the gloomy bay of [[Puerto San Julián|San Julian]], in what is now [[Argentina]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Ferdinand Magellan had called here half a century earlier, where he put to death some mutineers</span>
				<span class='text'>rake's men saw weathered and bleached skeletons on the grim Spanish [[gibbet]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>They discovered that ''Mary'' had rotting timbers, so they burned the ship</span>
				<span class='text'>Following Magellan's example, Drake tried and executed his own 'mutineer' [[Thomas Doughty (explorer)|Thomas Doughty]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Drake decided to remain the winter in San Julian before attempting the [[Strait of Magellan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==Entering the Pacific (1578)===The three remaining ships of his convoy departed for the Magellan Strait at the southern tip of South America</span>
				<span class='text'>A few weeks later (September 1578) Drake made it to the Pacific, but violent storms destroyed one of the three ships, the ''Marigold'' (captained by John Thomas) in the strait and caused another, the ''Elizabeth'' captained by John Wynter, to return to England, leaving only the ''Pelican''</span>
				<span class='text'>After this passage, the ''Pelican'' was pushed south and discovered an island which Drake called [[Elizabeth Island (Cape Horn)|Elizabeth Island]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Drake, like navigators before him, probably reached a latitude of 55°S (according to astronomical data quoted in [[Richard Hakluyt|Hakluyt]]'s ''The Principall Navigations, Voiages and Discoveries of the English Nation'' of 1589) along the Chilean coast</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;He pushed onwards in his lone flagship, now renamed the ''[[Golden Hind]]'' in honour of Sir [[Christopher Hatton]] (after his [[coat of arms]])</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''Golden Hind'' sailed north along the [[Pacific]] coast of South America, attacking Spanish ports and pillaging towns</span>
				<span class='text'>Some Spanish ships were captured, and Drake used their more accurate charts</span>
				<span class='text'>Before reaching the coast of [[Peru]], Drake visited [[Mocha Island]], where he was seriously injured by hostile [[Mapuche]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Later he sacked the port of [[Valparaíso]] further north in [[Chile]] where he also captured a ship full of [[Chilean wine]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Drake also discovered news of another ship, ''[[Nuestra Señora de la Concepción]]'', which was sailing west towards [[Manila]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Drake was naturally pleased at his good luck in capturing the galleon and he showed it by dining with the captured ship's officers and gentleman passengers</span>

				<span class='text'>His hostility is said to have increased over an incident at San Juan de Ulúa in 1568, when Drake was sailing with the fleet of his second cousin [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|John Hawkins]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Whilst negotiating to resupply and repair at the Spanish port, the fleet were attacked by Spanish warships, with all but two of the English ships lost</span>
				<span class='text'>Drake survived the attack by swimming</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=March 2009}}The most celebrated of Drake's adventures along the [[Spanish Main]] was his capture of the Spanish Silver Train at [[Nombre de Dios, Colón|Nombre de Dios]] in March 1573</span>
				<span class='text'>With a crew including many French privateers and [[Maroon (people)|Maroons]]—African slaves who had escaped the Spanish—Drake raided the waters around [[Darién, Panama|Darien]] (in modern [[Panama]]) and tracked the Silver Train to the nearby port of Nombre de Dios</span>
				<span class='text'>He made off with a fortune in gold, but had to leave behind another fortune in silver, because it was too heavy to carry back to England</span>
				<span class='text'>t was during this expedition that he climbed a high tree in the central mountains of the [[Isthmus of Panama]] and thus became the first Englishman to see the Pacific Ocean</span>
				<span class='text'>He remarked as he saw it that he hoped one day an Englishman would be able to sail it—which he would do years later as part of his circumnavigation of the world</span>
				<span class='text'>hen Drake returned to Plymouth after the raids, the government signed a temporary truce with King Philip II of Spain and so was unable to acknowledge Drake's accomplishment officially</span>
				<span class='text'>Drake was considered a hero in England and a pirate in Spain for his raids</span>

				<span class='text'>At the time of the massacre, he was charged with the task of keeping Scottish vessels from bringing reinforcements to Rathlin Island</span>
				<span class='text'>The people who were massacred were, in fact, the families of [[Sorley Boy MacDonnell]]'s followers</span>

				<span class='text'>]On his voyage to interfere with Spanish treasure fleets, Drake had several quarrels with his co-commander Thomas Doughty and on 3 June 1578, accused him of witchcraft and charged him with [[mutiny]] and [[treason]] in a shipboard trial</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name= Coote /&gt; Drake claimed to have a (never presented) commission from the Queen to carry out such acts and denied Doughty a trial in England</span>
				<span class='text'>The main pieces of evidence against Doughty were the testimony of the ship's carpenter, Edward Bright, who after the trial was promoted to master of the ship ''Marigold'', and Doughty's admission of telling [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Lord Burghley]], a vocal opponent of agitating the Spanish, of the intent of the voyage</span>
				<span class='text'>Drake consented to his request of [[Eucharist|Communion]] and dined with him, of which [[Francis Fletcher (clergyman)|Francis Fletcher]] had this strange account:{{quote|And after this holy repast, they dined also at the same table together, as cheerfully, in sobriety, as ever in their lives they had done aforetime, each cheering up the other, and taking their leave, by drinking each to other, as if some journey only had been in hand</span>
				<span class='text'>}Drake had Thomas Doughty beheaded on 2 July 1578</span>
				<span class='text'>When the ship's chaplain Francis Fletcher in a sermon suggested that the woes of the voyage in January 1580 were connected to the unjust demise of Doughty, Drake chained the clergyman to a hatch cover and pronounced him excommunicated</span>
