				<span class='text'>These publications came on the heels of the success of the  of Murder on the Orient Express in 1974</span>
				<span class='text'>hristie became increasingly tired of Poirot just as Sir  did with his character </span>
				<span class='text'>By the end of the 1930s Christie wrote in her diary that she was finding Poirot insufferable and by the 1960s she felt that he was an egocentric creep</span>
				<span class='text'>However unlike Conan Doyle Christie resisted the temptation to kill her detective off while he was still popular</span>
				<span class='text'>She saw herself as an entertainer whose job was to produce what the public liked and the public liked Poirot</span>
				<span class='text'> She did marry off Poirots companion Colonel Hastings in an attempt to trim her cast commitments</span>
				<span class='text'>name mallowan  In contrast Christie was fond of Miss Marple</span>
				<span class='text'>However the Belgian detectives titles outnumber the Marple titles more than two to one</span>
				<span class='text'>This is largely because Christie wrote numerous Poirot novels early in her career while  remained the sole Marple novel until the 1940s</span>
				<span class='text'>Christie never wrote a novel or short story featuring both Poirot and Miss Marple</span>
				<span class='text'>In a recording discovered and released in 2008 Christie revealed the reason for this Hercule Poirot a complete egoist would not like being taught his business or having suggestions made to him by an elderly spinster lady</span>
				<span class='text'>name  BBCdustyClues Poirot is the only fictional character to date to be given an obituary in  following the publication of Curtain</span>
				<span class='text'>It appeared on the front page of the paper on 6 August 1975</span>
				<span class='text'>Following the great success of Curtain Christie gave permission for the release of Sleeping Murder sometime in 1976 but died in January 1976 before the book could be released</span>
				<span class='text'>This may explain some of the inconsistencies compared to the rest of the Marple seriesampnbsp— for example Colonel Arthur Bantry husband of Miss Marples friend Dolly is still alive and well in Sleeping Murder despite the fact that he is noted as having died in books published earlier</span>
				<span class='text'>It may be that Christie simply did not have time to revise the manuscript before she died</span>
				<span class='text'>In 2013 the Christie family gave their full backing to the release of a new Poirot story The Monogram Murders which was written by British author </span>
				<span class='text'> Christies reputation as The Queen of Crime was built upon the large number of classic  that she introduced or for which she provided the most famous example</span>
				<span class='text'>Christie built these tropes into what is now considered classic mystery structure a murder is committed there are multiple suspects who are all concealing secrets and the detective gradually uncovers these secrets over the course of the story discovering the most shocking twists towards the end</span>
				<span class='text'>Culprits in Christies mysteries have included children policemen narrators already deceased individuals and sometimes comprise no known suspects  or all of the suspects </span>
				<span class='text'>t the end in a Christie hallmark the detective usually gathers the surviving suspects into one room explains the course of his deductive reasoning and reveals the guilty party although there are exceptions in which it is left to the guilty party to explain all such as  and  both rather  in nature</span>

				<span class='text'> 1998 39–43 Christie allows some culprits to escape earthly justice for a variety of reasons such as the passage of time retrospective cases in which the most important characters have already died or by active prescription</span>
				<span class='text'>Such cases include     and </span>
				<span class='text'>There are instances in which a killer is not brought to justice in the legal sense but does die as a direct result of his plot sometimes by his own hand at the direction or with the collusion of the detective usually Hercule Poirot</span>
				<span class='text'>This occurs in            and </span>
				<span class='text'>In the last of these Curtain no fewer than three culprits die during the course of the story</span>
				<span class='text'>n  the murderer has killed four innocent people and attempted to frame an unstable man for the crimes</span>
				<span class='text'>Hercule Poirot however prevents this easy way out ensuring a trial and hanging</span>
				<span class='text'>In  the killers own death is intrinsic to the plot the  is when and how the killer actually died</span>
				<span class='text'>However stage film and television productions of some of these mysteries were traditionally sanitized with the culprits not evading some form of justice for a variety of reasonsampnbsp– e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>censors plot clarity and Christies own changing tastes</span>
				<span class='text'>When Christie adapted  into a stage play she lengthened the ending so that the murderer was also killed this format was followed in film and television productions most famously the   film</span>
				<span class='text'>In  set in ancient  the culprit is killed in the act before he can claim another victim by one of the few surviving characters</span>

				<span class='text'>According to  Christie often but not always made the unlikeliest character the guilty party</span>
				<span class='text'>Savvy readers could sometimes identify the culprit by simply identifying the least likely suspect</span>

				<span class='text'>n an edition of  in 2007  claimed that Christie had told him that she wrote her books up to the last chapter then decided who the most unlikely suspect was after which she would go back and make the necessary changes to frame that person</span>
				<span class='text'>name Brian Aldiss claims Agatha tells method  However John Currans Agatha Christie The Secret Notebooks describes different working methods for every book in Christies bibliography contradicting the claim by Aldiss</span>
				<span class='text'> Christie occasionally inserted stereotyped descriptions of characters into her work particularly before the end of the Second World War when such attitudes were more commonly expressed publicly and particularly in regard to  Jews non Europeans and sometimes Americans the last usually as impossibly naïve or uninformed</span>
				<span class='text'>For example she described Hebraic men with hook noses wearing rather flamboyant jewellery in the first editions of the collection  1930 in the short story The Soul of the Croupier in later editions the passage was edited to describe sallow men wearing same</span>
				<span class='text'>In  published as late as 1946 one of the more unsympathetic characters is a Whitechapel Jewess with dyed hair and a voice like a  </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>a small woman with a thick nose henna red and a disagreeable voice</span>
				<span class='text'>To contrast with the more stereotyped descriptions Christie sometimes showed foreigners as victims or potential victims at the hands of English malefactors such as respectively Olga Seminoff  and Katrina Reiger in the short story How Does Your Garden Grow</span>
				<span class='text'>Jewish characters are often seen as un English such as Oliver Manders in  but they are rarely the culprits</span>
				<span class='text'>Often she is affectionate or teasing with her prejudices</span>
				<span class='text'>After four years of war torn London Christie hoped to return some day to Syria which she described as gentle fertile country and its simple people who know how to laugh and how to enjoy life who are idle and gay and who have dignity good manners and a great sense of humour and to whom death is not terrible</span>

				<span class='text'>But her fame as an author far surpassed his fame in archaeology</span>
				<span class='text'>Prior to meeting Mallowan Christie had not had any extensive brushes with archaeology but once the two married they made sure to only go to sites where they could work together</span>
				<span class='text'>Christie accompanied Mallowan on countless archaeological trips spending 3–4 months at a time in  and  at excavation sites at      and </span>
				<span class='text'>She wrote novels and short stories but also contributed work to the archaeological sites more specifically to the archaeological restoration and labelling of ancient exhibits including tasks such as cleaning and conserving delicate ivory pieces reconstructing pottery developing photos from early excavations which later led to taking photographs of the site and its findings and taking field notes</span>

				<span class='text'>name britishmuseum  During their time in the Middle East there was also a large amount of time spent travelling to and from Mallowans sites</span>
				<span class='text'>Their extensive travelling had a strong influence on her writing as some type of transportation often plays a part in her murderers schemes</span>
				<span class='text'>The large amount of travel was reused in novels such as  as well as suggesting the idea of archaeology as an adventure itself</span>
				<span class='text'>After the Second World War she chronicled her time in Syria with fondness in Come Tell Me How You Live</span>
