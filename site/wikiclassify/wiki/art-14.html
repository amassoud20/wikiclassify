				<span class='text'>She also read the work of [[Edith Nesbit]], including ''[[The Story of the Treasure Seekers]]'' (1899), ''[[The Phoenix and the Carpet]]'' (1903), and ''[[The Railway Children]]'' (1906)</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1905, she was sent to [[Paris]] where she was educated in three ''pensions''&amp;nbsp;– Mademoiselle Cabernet's, Les Marroniers, and then Miss Dryden's&amp;nbsp;– the last of which served primarily as a [[finishing school]]</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mallowan&quot;/&gt;{{rp|422}} Marple appeared in 12 of Christie's novels</span>
				<span class='text'>During the Second World War, Christie wrote two novels, ''[[Curtain (novel)|Curtain]]'' and ''[[Sleeping Murder]]'', intended as the last cases of these two great detectives, Hercule Poirot and Jane Marple</span>
				<span class='text'>Both books were sealed in a [[bank vault]] for over thirty years and were released for publication by Christie only at the end of her life, when she realised that she could not write any more novels</span>
				<span class='text'>These publications came on the heels of the success of the [[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|film version]] of ''Murder on the Orient Express'' in 1974</span>
				<span class='text'>hristie became increasingly tired of Poirot, just as Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] did with his character [[Sherlock Holmes]]</span>
				<span class='text'>By the end of the 1930s, Christie wrote in her diary that she was finding Poirot &quot;insufferable&quot;, and by the 1960s she felt that he was &quot;an egocentric creep&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>However, unlike Conan Doyle, Christie resisted the temptation to kill her detective off while he was still popular</span>
				<span class='text'>She saw herself as an entertainer whose job was to produce what the public liked, and the public liked Poirot</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;mallowan&quot;/&gt;{{rp|268}} In contrast, Christie was fond of Miss Marple</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the Belgian detective's titles outnumber the Marple titles more than two to one</span>
				<span class='text'>This is largely because Christie wrote numerous Poirot novels early in her career, while ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' remained the sole Marple novel until the 1940s</span>
				<span class='text'>Christie never wrote a novel or short story featuring both Poirot and Miss Marple</span>
				<span class='text'>In a recording discovered and released in 2008, Christie revealed the reason for this: &quot;Hercule Poirot, a complete egoist, would not like being taught his business or having suggestions made to him by an elderly spinster lady&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name =BBCdustyClues/&gt;Poirot is the only fictional character to date to be given an obituary in ''[[The New York Times]]'', following the publication of ''Curtain''</span>

				<span class='text'>This may explain some of the inconsistencies compared to the rest of the Marple series&amp;nbsp;— for example, Colonel Arthur Bantry, husband of Miss Marple's friend Dolly, is still alive and well in ''Sleeping Murder'' despite the fact that he is noted as having died in books published earlier</span>
				<span class='text'>It may be that Christie simply did not have time to revise the manuscript before she died</span>

				<span class='text'>Christie built these tropes into what is now considered classic mystery structure: a murder is committed, there are multiple suspects who are all concealing secrets, and the detective gradually uncovers these secrets over the course of the story, discovering the most shocking twists towards the end</span>
				<span class='text'>Culprits in Christie's mysteries have included children, policemen, narrators, already deceased individuals, and sometimes comprise no known suspects (''[[And Then There Were None]]'') or all of the suspects (''[[Murder on the Orient Express]]'')</span>
				<span class='text'>t the end, in a Christie hallmark, the detective usually gathers the surviving suspects into one room, explains the course of his deductive reasoning, and reveals the guilty party, although there are exceptions in which it is left to the guilty party to explain all (such as ''[[And Then There Were None]]'' and ''[[Endless Night]]'', both rather [[nihilism|nihilistic]] in nature)</span>

				<span class='text'> (1998): 39–43&lt;/ref&gt;Christie allows some culprits to escape earthly justice for a variety of reasons, such as the passage of time (retrospective cases), in which the most important characters have already died, or by active prescription</span>
				<span class='text'>Such cases include ''[[The Witness for the Prosecution]]'', ''[[Murder on the Orient Express]]'', ''[[The Man in the Brown Suit]]'', ''[[Elephants Can Remember]]'', and ''[[The Unexpected Guest (play)|The Unexpected Guest]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>There are instances in which a killer is not brought to justice in the legal sense but does die as a direct result of his plot, sometimes by his own hand at the direction or with the collusion of the detective (usually Hercule Poirot)</span>
				<span class='text'>This occurs in ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]'', ''[[Death on the Nile]]'', ''[[Dumb Witness]]'', ''[[Crooked House]]'', ''[[The Hollow]]'', ''[[The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side]]'', ''[[Cat Among the Pigeons]]'', ''[[Peril at End House]]'', ''[[Nemesis (Agatha Christie novel)|Nemesis]]'', ''[[Appointment with Death]]'', ''[[The Secret Adversary]]'', and ''[[Curtain (novel)|Curtain]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>In the last of these (''Curtain''), no fewer than three culprits die during the course of the story</span>
				<span class='text'>n ''[[The A</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Murders]]'', the murderer has killed four innocent people and attempted to frame an unstable man for the crimes</span>
				<span class='text'>Hercule Poirot, however, prevents this easy way out, ensuring a trial and hanging</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''[[And Then There Were None]]'', the killer's own death is intrinsic to the plot; the [[red herring]] is when and how the killer actually died</span>
				<span class='text'>However, stage, film, and television productions of some of these mysteries were traditionally sanitized with the culprits not evading some form of justice, for a variety of reasons&amp;nbsp;– e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> censors, plot clarity, and Christie's own changing tastes</span>
				<span class='text'>(When Christie adapted ''[[The Witness for the Prosecution|Witness for the Prosecution]]'' into a stage play, she lengthened the ending so that the murderer was also killed; this format was followed in film and television productions, most famously the [[Charles Laughton]]/[[Marlene Dietrich]] film</span>
				<span class='text'> In ''[[Death Comes as the End]]'', set in ancient [[Egypt]], the culprit is killed in the act before he can claim another victim by one of the few surviving characters</span>
				<span class='text'>n some stories, the question remains unresolved of whether formal justice will ever be delivered, such as ''[[Five Little Pigs]]'', ''[[Endless Night]]'', and ''[[Ordeal by Innocence]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>According to [[P</span>
				<span class='text'>D</span>
				<span class='text'>James]], Christie often, but not always, made the unlikeliest character the guilty party</span>
				<span class='text'>Savvy readers could sometimes identify the culprit by simply identifying the least likely suspect</span>

				<span class='text'>{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}====Character stereotypes====Christie occasionally inserted stereotyped descriptions of characters into her work, particularly before the end of the Second World War (when such attitudes were more commonly expressed publicly), and particularly in regard to [[Italian people|Italians]], Jews, non-Europeans, and sometimes Americans, the last usually as impossibly naïve or uninformed</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, she described &quot;Hebraic men with hook-noses wearing rather flamboyant jewellery&quot; in the first editions of the collection ''[[The Mysterious Mr Quin]]'' (1930), in the short story &quot;The Soul of the Croupier&quot;; in later editions, the passage was edited to describe &quot;sallow men&quot; wearing same</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''[[The Hollow]]'', published as late as 1946, one of the more unsympathetic characters is &quot;a Whitechapel Jewess with dyed hair and a voice like a [[corncrake]] </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>a small woman with a thick nose, henna red and a disagreeable voice&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>To contrast with the more stereotyped descriptions, Christie sometimes showed &quot;foreigners&quot; as victims or potential victims at the hands of English malefactors, such as, respectively, Olga Seminoff (''[[Hallowe'en Party]]'') and Katrina Reiger (in the short story &quot;How Does Your Garden Grow?&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>Jewish characters are often seen as un-English (such as Oliver Manders in ''[[Three Act Tragedy]]''), but they are rarely the culprits</span>

				<span class='text'>After four years of war-torn London, Christie hoped to return some day to Syria, which she described as &quot;gentle fertile country and its simple people, who know how to laugh and how to enjoy life; who are idle and gay, and who have dignity, good manners, and a great sense of humour, and to whom death is not terrible</span>

				<span class='text'> Anecdotes, memories, funny episodes are strung in a rough timeline, with more emphasis on eccentric characters and lovely scenery than on factual accuracy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;mallowan&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1985}} From 8 November 2001 to 24 March 2002, [[British Museum|The British Museum]] had an exhibit named ''Agatha Christie and Archaeology: Mystery in Mesopotamia'', which presented the life of Agatha Christie and the influences of archaeology in her life and works</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;britishmuseum&quot;/&gt;===Use of archaeology in her writing==={{unsourced|section|date=December 2015}}Many of the settings for Christie's books were directly inspired by the many archaeological field seasons spent in the Middle East on the sites managed by her husband Max</span>
				<span class='text'>The extent of her time spent at the many locations featured in her books is apparent from the extreme detail in which she describes them</span>
				<span class='text'>One such site featured in her work is the temple site of [[Abu Simbel temples|Abu Simbel]], depicted in ''[[Death on the Nile]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Also there is the great detail in which she describes life at the dig site in ''[[Murder in Mesopotamia]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Among the characters in her books, Christie has often given prominence to the archaeologists and experts in Middle Eastern cultures and artifacts</span>
				<span class='text'>Most notable are the characters of Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Eric Leidner in ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' and Signor Richetti in ''Death on the Nile'', while many minor characters were archaeologists in ''They Came to Baghdad''</span>
				<span class='text'>{cn|date=January 2016}}Some of Christie's best known novels with heavy archaeological influences are:* ''[[Murder in Mesopotamia|Murder in Mesopotamia (1936)]]'' – the most archaeologically influenced of all her novels, as it is set in the Middle East at an archaeological dig site and associated expedition house</span>
				<span class='text'>The main characters include archaeologist Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Eric Leidner, his wife, multiple specialists and assistants, and the men working on the site</span>
				<span class='text'>The novel is noted most for its careful description of the dig site and house, which showed that the author had spent much of her time in very similar situations</span>
				<span class='text'>The characters in this book in particular are also based on archaeologists whom Christie knew from her personal experiences on excavation sites</span>
				<span class='text'> ''[[Death on the Nile|Death on the Nile (1937)]]'' – takes place on a tour boat on the Nile</span>
				<span class='text'>Many archaeological sites are visited along the way and one of the main characters, Signor Richetti, is an archaeologist</span>
				<span class='text'> ''[[Appointment with Death|Appointment with Death (1938)]]'' – set in [[Jerusalem]] and its surrounding area</span>
				<span class='text'>The death itself occurs at an old cave site in [[Petra]] and offers some very descriptive details of sites which Christie herself could have visited in order to write the book</span>
				<span class='text'> ''[[They Came to Baghdad|They Came to Baghdad (1951)]]'' – inspired by Christie's own trips to [[Baghdad]] with Mallowan, and involves an archaeologist as the heroine's love interest</span>
				<span class='text'>=Portrayals of Christie==Christie has been portrayed on a number of occasions in film and television</span>
				<span class='text'>Several biographical programmes have been made, such as [[BBC television]]'s ''[[Agatha Christie: A Life in Pictures]]'' (2004), in which she is portrayed by [[Olivia Williams]], [[Anna Massey]], and [[Bonnie Wright]]; and Season 3, Episode 1 of ''[[ITV (TV channel)|ITV Perspectives]]'': &quot;The Mystery of Agatha Christie&quot; (2013), hosted by [[David Suchet]], who plays Hercule Poirot on television</span>

				<span class='text'>om/title/tt2797170}}&lt;/ref&gt;Christie has also been portrayed fictionally</span>
				<span class='text'>Some of these portrayals have explored and offered accounts of Christie's disappearance in 1926, including the film ''[[Agatha (film)|Agatha]]'' (1979) (with [[Vanessa Redgrave]], in which she sneaks away to plan revenge against her husband), and the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode &quot;[[The Unicorn and the Wasp]]&quot; (17 May 2008), with [[Fenella Woolgar]], in which her disappearance is the result of her suffering a temporary breakdown owing to a brief psychic link being formed between her and an alien</span>
				<span class='text'>Others, such as Hungarian film, ''Kojak Budapesten'' (1980; not to be confused with the 1986 comedy by the same name) create their own scenarios involving Christie's criminal skill</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kojak Budapesten|year=1990|url=http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In the TV play, ''Murder by the Book'' (1986), Christie herself (Dame [[Peggy Ashcroft]]) murdered one of her fictional-turned-real characters, Poirot</span>
				<span class='text'>The heroine of Liar-Soft's [[visual novel]] ''[[Shikkoku no Sharnoth: What a Beautiful Tomorrow]]'' (2008), Mary Clarissa Christie, is based on the real-life Christie</span>
