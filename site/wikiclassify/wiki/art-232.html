				<span class='text'>His parents served in India at a mission under the auspices of the [[Basel Mission]], a Protestant Christian missionary society</span>
				<span class='text'>Hesse's mother, Marie Gundert, was born at such a mission in India in 1842</span>
				<span class='text'>In describing her own childhood, she said, &quot;A happy child I was not</span>

				<span class='text'>Johannes Hesse belonged to the German minority in the Russian-ruled [[Baltic region]]: thus his son Hermann was at birth both a citizen of the [[German Empire]] and the [[Russian Empire]]</span>

				<span class='text'>February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Hermann had five siblings, but two of them died in infancy</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1873, the Hesse family moved to Calw, where Johannes worked for the Calwer Verlagsverein, a publishing house specializing in theological texts and schoolbooks</span>
				<span class='text'>Marie's father, [[Hermann Gundert]], managed the publishing house at the time, and Johannes Hesse succeeded him in 1893</span>
				<span class='text'>esse grew up in a [[Swabia]]n [[Pietism|Pietist]] household, with the Pietist tendency to insulate believers into small, deeply thoughtful groups</span>
				<span class='text'>Furthermore, Hesse described his father's [[Baltic Germans|Baltic German]] heritage as &quot;an important and potent fact&quot; of his developing identity</span>
				<span class='text'>His father, Hesse stated, &quot;always seemed like a very polite, very foreign, lonely, little-understood guest</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; His father's tales from Estonia instilled a contrasting sense of religion in young Hermann</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;[It was] an exceedingly cheerful, and, for all its Christianity, a merry world</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>We wished for nothing so longingly as to be allowed to see this Estonia </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>where life was so paradisiacal, so colorful and happy</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Hermann Hesse's sense of estrangement from the Swabian petty bourgeoisie further grew through his relationship with his maternal grandmother Julie Gundert, {{née}} Dubois, whose French-Swiss heritage kept her from ever quite fitting in among that milieu</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated414&quot;/&gt;=== Childhood ===From childhood, Hesse appeared headstrong and hard for his family to handle</span>
				<span class='text'>In a letter to her husband, Hermann's mother Marie wrote: &quot;The little fellow has a life in him, an unbelievable strength, a powerful will, and, for his four years of age, a truly astonishing mind</span>
				<span class='text'>How can he express all that? It truly gnaws at my life, this internal fighting against his tyrannical temperament, his passionate turbulence [</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> God must shape this proud spirit, then it will become something noble and magnificent – but I shudder to think what this young and passionate person might become should his upbringing be false or weak</span>

				<span class='text'>Click to see an enlarged image, in which the statue of Hesse can be seen near the center</span>
				<span class='text'>]Hesse showed signs of serious depression as early as his first year at school</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Freedman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>30&lt;/ref&gt;In his [[juvenilia]] collection ''Gerbersau,'' Hesse vividly describes experiences and anecdotes from his childhood and youth in Calw: the atmosphere and adventures by the river, the bridge, the chapel, the houses leaning closely together, hidden nooks and crannies, as well as the inhabitants with their admirable qualities, their oddities, and their idiosyncrasies</span>
				<span class='text'>The fictional town of Gerbersau is pseudonymous for Calw, imitating the real name of the nearby town of [[Hirsau]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It is derived from the German words ''gerber'', meaning &quot;tanner,&quot; and ''aue'', meaning &quot;meadow</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;An English equivalent would be &quot;Tannersmead</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Calw had a centuries-old leather-working industry, and during Hesse's childhood the tanneries' influence on the town was still very much in evidence</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Siegfried Greiner ''Hermann Hesse, Jugend in Calw'', Thorbecke (1981), ISBN 3799520090 p</span>
				<span class='text'>viii&lt;/ref&gt; Hesse's favorite place in Calw was the St</span>
				<span class='text'>Nicholas-Bridge (''Nikolausbrücke''), which is why the Hesse monument was built there in 2002</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=November 2014}}Hermann Hesse's grandfather [[Hermann Gundert]], a doctor of philosophy and fluent in multiple languages, encouraged the boy to read widely, giving him access to his library, which was filled with the works of world literature</span>
				<span class='text'>All this instilled a sense in Hermann Hesse that he was a citizen of the world</span>
				<span class='text'>His family background became, he noted, &quot;the basis of an isolation and a resistance to any sort of nationalism that so defined my life</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated414&quot;/&gt;Young Hesse shared a love of music with his mother</span>
				<span class='text'>Both music and poetry were important in his family</span>
				<span class='text'>His mother wrote poetry, and his father was known for his use of language in both his sermons and the writing of religious tracts</span>
				<span class='text'>His first role model for becoming an artist was his half-brother, Theo, who rebelled against the family by entering a music conservatory in 1885</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Freedman (1978) pp</span>
				<span class='text'>30–32&lt;/ref&gt;  Hesse showed a precocious ability to rhyme, and by 1889–90 had decided that he wanted to be a writer</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Freedman (1978) p</span>
				<span class='text'>39&lt;/ref&gt;=== Education ===In 1881, when Hesse was four, the family moved to [[Basel]], Switzerland, staying for six years and then returning to Calw</span>
				<span class='text'>After successful attendance at the Latin School in [[Göppingen]], Hesse entered the [[Evangelical Seminaries of Maulbronn and Blaubeuren|Evangelical Theological Seminary]] of [[Maulbronn Abbey]] in 1891</span>
				<span class='text'>The pupils lived and studied at the abbey, one of Germany's most beautiful and well-preserved, attending 41 hours of classes a week</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Hesse did well during the first months, writing in a letter that he particularly enjoyed writing essays and translating classic Greek poetry into German, his time in Maulbronn was the beginning of a serious personal crisis</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Zeller, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>6–30&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1892, Hesse showed his rebellious character, and, in one instance, he fled from the Seminary and was found in a field a day later</span>
				<span class='text'>Hesse began a journey through various institutions and schools and experienced intense conflicts with his parents</span>
				<span class='text'>In May, after an attempt at suicide, he spent time at an institution in [[Bad Boll]] under the care of theologian and minister [[Christoph Friedrich Blumhardt]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Later, he was placed in a mental institution in [[Stetten im Remstal]], and then a boys' institution in Basel</span>
				<span class='text'>At the end of 1892, he attended the [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in Cannstatt, now part of [[Stuttgart]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1893, he passed the One Year Examination, which concluded his schooling</span>
				<span class='text'>The same year, he began spending time with older companions and took up drinking and smoking</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Freedman (1978) p</span>
				<span class='text'>53&lt;/ref&gt;After this, Hesse began a bookshop apprenticeship in [[Esslingen am Neckar]], but quit after three days</span>
				<span class='text'>Then, in the early summer of 1894, he began a 14-month mechanic apprenticeship at a clock tower factory in Calw</span>
				<span class='text'>The monotony of soldering and filing work made him turn himself toward more spiritual activities</span>
				<span class='text'>In October 1895, he was ready to begin wholeheartedly a new apprenticeship with a bookseller in [[Tübingen]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This experience from his youth, especially his time spent at the Seminary in Maulbronn, he returns to later in his novel ''[[Beneath the Wheel]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>== Becoming a writer ===[[File:Printing4 Walk of Ideas Berlin</span>
				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|upright|''Modern Book Printing'' from the [[Walk of Ideas]] in Berlin, Germany]]On 17 October 1895, Hesse began working in the bookshop in Tübingen, which had a specialized collection in theology, philology, and law</span>

				<span class='text'>heckenhauer</span>
				<span class='text'>e&lt;/ref&gt; Hesse's tasks consisted of organizing, packing, and archiving the books</span>
				<span class='text'>After the end of each twelve-hour workday, Hesse pursued his own work, and he spent his long, idle Sundays with books rather than friends</span>
				<span class='text'>Hesse studied theological writings and later [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]], [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], and [[Greek mythology]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also began reading [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] in 1895,&lt;ref&gt;Freedman (1978) p</span>
				<span class='text'>69&lt;/ref&gt; and that philosopher's ideas of &quot;dual</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>mpulses of passion and order&quot; in humankind was a heavy influence on most of his novels</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Freedman (1978) p</span>
				<span class='text'>111&lt;/ref&gt;By 1898, Hesse had a respectable income that enabled financial independence from his parents</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation_needed|date=March 2013}} During this time, he concentrated on the works of the [[German Romanticism|German Romantics]], including much of the work from [[Clemens Brentano]], [[Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff]], [[Friedrich Hölderlin]], and [[Novalis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In letters to his parents, he expressed a belief that &quot;the morality of artists is replaced by aesthetics&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>uring this time, he was introduced to the home of Fräulein von Reutern, a friend of his family's</span>
				<span class='text'> There he met with people his own age</span>
				<span class='text'> His relationships with his contemporaries were &quot;problematic&quot;, in that most of them were now at university</span>
				<span class='text'> This usually left him feeling awkward in social situations</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Freedman (1978) p</span>
				<span class='text'>64&lt;/ref&gt;In 1896, his poem &quot;Madonna&quot; appeared in a [[Vienna|Viennese]] periodical and Hesse released his first small volume of poetry, ''Romantic Songs</span>
				<span class='text'>' In 1897, a published poem of his, &quot;Grand Valse&quot;, drew him a fan letter</span>
				<span class='text'> It was from [[Helene Voigt-Diederichs|Helene Voigt]], who the next year married [[Eugen Diederichs]], a young publisher</span>
				<span class='text'> To please his wife, Diederichs agreed to publish Hesse's collection of prose entitled ''[[One Hour After Midnight]]'' in 1898 (although it is dated 1899)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Freedman(1978) pp</span>
				<span class='text'>78–80&lt;/ref&gt; Both works were a business failure</span>
				<span class='text'>In two years, only 54 of the 600 printed copies of ''Romantic Songs'' were sold, and ''One Hour After Midnight'' received only one printing and sold sluggishly</span>
				<span class='text'>Furthermore, Hesse &quot;suffered a great shock&quot; when his mother disapproved of &quot;Romantic Songs&quot; on the grounds that they were too secular and even &quot;vaguely sinful</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Freedman(1978), p</span>
				<span class='text'>79&lt;/ref&gt;From late 1899, Hesse worked in a distinguished antique book shop in Basel</span>
				<span class='text'>Through family contacts, he stayed with the intellectual families of Basel</span>
				<span class='text'>In this environment with rich stimuli for his pursuits, he further developed spiritually and artistically</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time, Basel offered the solitary Hesse many opportunities for withdrawal into a private life of artistic self-exploration, journeys and wanderings</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1900, Hesse was exempted from compulsory military service due to an [[Amblyopia|eye condition]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This, along with [[Neuralgia|nerve disorders]] and persistent headaches, affected him his entire life</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1901, Hesse undertook to fulfill a long-held dream and travelled for the first time to Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>In the same year, Hesse changed jobs and began working at the antiquarium Wattenwyl in Basel</span>
				<span class='text'>Hesse had more opportunities to release poems and small literary texts to journals</span>
				<span class='text'>These publications now provided honorariums</span>
				<span class='text'>His new bookstore agreed to publish his next work, ''[[Posthumous Writings and Poems of Hermann Lauscher</span>
				<span class='text'>]''&lt;ref&gt;Freedman(1978) p</span>
				<span class='text'>97&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902, his mother died after a long and painful illness</span>
				<span class='text'> He could not bring himself to attend her funeral, afraid that it would worsen his depression</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Freedman(1978), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>99–101&lt;/ref&gt;Due to the good notices that Hesse received for ''[[Lauscher]],'' the publisher [[Samuel Fischer]] became interested in Hesse&lt;ref&gt;Freedman (1978) p</span>
				<span class='text'>107&lt;/ref&gt; and, with the novel ''[[Peter Camenzind]]'', which appeared first as a pre-publication in 1903 and then as a regular printing by Fischer in 1904, came a breakthrough: from now on, Hesse could make a living as a writer</span>
				<span class='text'> The novel became popular throughout Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Freedman (1978) p</span>
				<span class='text'>108&lt;/ref&gt; Sigmund Freud &quot;praised ''[[Peter Camenzind]]'' as one of his favorite readings</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Freedman (1978) p</span>
				<span class='text'>117</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;=== Between Lake Constance and India ===[[File:Hermann Hesse</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|1905 Portrait by Ernst Würtenberger (1868–1934)]][[File:Hermann Hesse Desk Museum Gaienhofen</span>
				<span class='text'>peg|thumb|Hesse's writing desk, pictured at the Museum Gaienhofen]]With the literary fame, Hesse married Maria Bernoulli (of the [[Bernoulli family|famous family of mathematicians]]&lt;ref&gt;Gustav Emil Müller, ''[http://books</span>

				<span class='text'>om/books?id=WklYtBo4XpsC Philosophy of Literature]'', Ayer Publishing, 1976</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;) in 1904, settled down with her in [[Gaienhofen]] on [[Lake Constance]], and began a family, eventually having three sons</span>
				<span class='text'>In Gaienhofen, he wrote his second novel, ''[[Beneath the Wheel]]'', which was published in 1906</span>
				<span class='text'>In the following time, he composed primarily short stories and poems</span>
				<span class='text'>His story &quot;The Wolf,&quot; written in 1906–07, was &quot;quite possibly&quot; a foreshadowing of ''[[Steppenwolf (novel)|Steppenwolf]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Freedman (1978) p</span>
				<span class='text'>140&lt;/ref&gt;His next novel, ''[[Gertrud (novel)|Gertrude]]'', published in 1910, revealed a production crisis</span>
				<span class='text'>He had to struggle through writing it, and he later would describe it as &quot;a miscarriage&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Gaienhofen was the place where Hesse's interest in [[Buddhism]] was re-sparked</span>
				<span class='text'>Following a letter to Kapff in 1895 entitled ''Nirvana'', Hesse had ceased alluding to Buddhist references in his work</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1904, however, [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] and his philosophical ideas started receiving attention again, and Hesse discovered [[theosophy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Schopenhauer and theosophy renewed Hesse's interest in India</span>
				<span class='text'>Although it was many years before the publication of Hesse's ''Siddhartha'' (1922), this masterpiece was to be derived from these new influences</span>
				<span class='text'>uring this time, there also was increased dissonance between him and Maria, and in 1911 Hesse left for a long trip to [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Indonesia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also visited Sumatra, Borneo, and Burma, but &quot;the physical experience</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>was to depress him</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Freedman (1978) p</span>
				<span class='text'>149&lt;/ref&gt;  Any spiritual or religious inspiration that he was looking for eluded him,{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} but the journey made a strong impression on his literary work</span>
				<span class='text'>Following Hesse's return, the family moved to [[Bern]] (1912), but the change of environment could not solve the marriage problems, as he himself confessed in his novel ''[[Rosshalde]]'' from 1914</span>
				<span class='text'>== During the First World War ===At the outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914, Hesse registered himself as a volunteer with the [[German Army (German Empire)|Imperial army]], saying that he could not sit inactively by a warm fireplace while other young authors were dying on the front</span>
				<span class='text'>He was found unfit for combat duty, but was assigned to service involving the care of prisoners of war</span>

				<span class='text'>'&lt;ref&gt;Zeller, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>83–84&lt;/ref&gt; What followed from this, Hesse later indicated, was a great turning point in his life: For the first time, he found himself in the middle of a serious political conflict, attacked by the German press, the recipient of hate mail, and distanced from old friends</span>
				<span class='text'>He did receive continued support from his friend [[Theodor Heuss]], and the French writer [[Romain Rolland]], who visited Hesse in August 1915</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Freedman (1978) pp</span>
				<span class='text'>170–71</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Freedman (1978) p</span>
				<span class='text'>189&lt;/ref&gt;This public controversy was not yet resolved when a deeper life crisis befell Hesse with the death of his father on 8 March 1916, the serious illness of his son Martin, and his wife's [[schizophrenia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was forced to leave his military service and begin receiving [[psychotherapy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This began for Hesse a long preoccupation with [[psychoanalysis]], through which he came to know [[Carl Jung]] personally, and was challenged to new creative heights</span>
				<span class='text'>During a three-week period in September and October 1917, Hesse penned his novel ''[[Demian]]'', which would be published following the armistice in 1919 under the [[pseudonym]] Emil Sinclair</span>

				<span class='text'>His wife had a severe episode of [[psychosis]], but, even after her recovery, Hesse saw no possible future with her</span>
				<span class='text'>Their home in Bern was divided, their children were accommodated in pensions and by relatives,&lt;ref&gt;Zeller, p</span>
				<span class='text'>93&lt;/ref&gt; and Hesse resettled alone in the middle of April in [[Ticino]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He occupied a small farm house near Minusio (close to  Locarno), living from 25 April to 11 May in Sorengo</span>
				<span class='text'>On 11 May, he moved to the town [[Montagnola]] and rented four small rooms in a castle-like building, the Casa Camuzzi</span>
				<span class='text'>Here, he explored his writing projects further; he began to paint, an activity reflected in his next major story, &quot;[[Klingsor's Last Summer]]&quot;, published in 1920</span>
				<span class='text'>This new beginning in different surroundings brought him happiness, and Hesse later called his first year in Ticino ''the fullest, most prolific, most industrious and most passionate time of my life</span>
				<span class='text'>'&lt;ref&gt;Zeller, p</span>
				<span class='text'>94&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, Hesse's novella ''[[Siddhartha (novel)|Siddhartha]]'' appeared, which showed the love for Indian culture and Buddhist philosophy that had already developed earlier in his life</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1924, Hesse married the singer Ruth Wenger, the daughter of the Swiss writer [[Lisa Wenger]] and aunt of [[Méret Oppenheim]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This marriage never attained any stability, however</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1923, Hesse received Swiss citizenship</span>
				<span class='text'>His next major works, ''Kurgast'' (1925) and ''The Nuremberg Trip'' (1927), were autobiographical narratives with ironic undertones and foreshadowed Hesse's following novel, ''[[Steppenwolf (novel)|Steppenwolf]]'', which was published in 1927</span>
				<span class='text'>In the year of his 50th birthday, the first biography of Hesse appeared, written by his friend [[Hugo Ball]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Shortly after his new successful novel, he turned away from the solitude of Steppenwolf and married art historian [[Ninon Hesse|Ninon Dolbin, {{née}} Ausländer]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This change to companionship was reflected in the novel ''[[Narcissus and Goldmund]]'', appearing in 1930</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1931, Hesse left the Casa Camuzzi and moved with Ninon to a large house (Casa Hesse) near [[Montagnola]], which was built according to his wishes</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1931, Hesse began planning what would become his last major work, ''[[The Glass Bead Game]]'' (a</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>''Magister Ludi'')</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1932, as a preliminary study, he released the novella ''[[Journey to the East]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>''The Glass Bead Game'' was printed in 1943 in Switzerland</span>
				<span class='text'>He was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1946</span>
				<span class='text'>== Religious views ===In a conversation with [[Miguel Serrano]], Herman Hesse commented about the belief in God: {{Quote|&quot;You should let yourself be carried away, like the clouds in the sky</span>
				<span class='text'>You shouldn’t resist</span>
				<span class='text'>God exists in your destiny just as much as he does in these mountains and in that lake</span>
				<span class='text'>It is very difficult to understand this, because man is moving further and further away from Nature, and also from himself</span>

				<span class='text'>1946]]Hesse observed the rise to power of [[Nazism]] in Germany with concern</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1933, [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Thomas Mann]] made their travels into exile, each aided by Hesse</span>
				<span class='text'>In this way, Hesse attempted to work against [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s suppression of art and literature that protested Nazi ideology</span>
				<span class='text'>Hesse's third wife was Jewish, and he had publicly expressed his opposition to anti-Semitism long before then</span>

				<span class='text'>'The Glass Bead Game'' was Hesse's last novel</span>
				<span class='text'>During the last twenty years of his life, Hesse wrote many short stories (chiefly recollections of his childhood) and poems (frequently with nature as their theme)</span>
				<span class='text'>Hesse also wrote ironic essays about his alienation from writing (for instance, the mock autobiographies: ''Life Story Briefly Told'' and ''Aus den Briefwechseln eines Dichters'') and spent much time pursuing his interest in watercolors</span>
				<span class='text'>Hesse also occupied himself with the steady stream of letters he received as a result of the Nobel Prize and as a new generation of German readers explored his work</span>
				<span class='text'>In one essay, Hesse reflected wryly on his lifelong failure to acquire a talent for idleness and speculated that his average daily correspondence exceeded 150 pages</span>
				<span class='text'>He died on 9 August 1962, aged 85, and was buried in the cemetery at [[Sant’Abbondio|San Abbondio]] in [[Montagnola]], where [[Hugo Ball]] and the great conductor [[Bruno Walter]] are also buried</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=November 2013}}==Influence==[[File:Hermann Hesse Bueste</span>
				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|upright|left|Statue in [[Calw]]]]In his time, Hesse was a popular and influential author in the German-speaking world; worldwide fame only came later</span>
				<span class='text'>Hesse's first great novel, ''[[Peter Camenzind]]'', was received enthusiastically by young Germans desiring a different and more &quot;natural&quot; way of life at the time of great economic and technological progress in the country (see also [[Wandervogel]] movement)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Prinz, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>139–142&lt;/ref&gt;'' [[Demian]]'' had a strong and enduring influence on the generation of home-returners from the [[First World War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;ref&gt;Zeller, p</span>
				<span class='text'>90&lt;/ref&gt; similarly, ''[[The Glass Bead Game]]'', with its disciplined intellectual world of Castalia and the powers of mediation and humanity, captivated Germans' longing for a new order amid the chaos of a broken nation following the loss in the [[Second World War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Zeller, p</span>
				<span class='text'>186&lt;/ref&gt;In the 1950s, Hesse's popularity began to wane, while literature critics and intellectuals turned their attention to other subjects</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1965, the sales of Hesse's books by his publisher [[Suhrkamp Verlag|Suhrkamp]] reached an all-time low</span>
				<span class='text'>However, after Hesse's death in 1962, posthumously published writings, including letters and previously unknown pieces of prose, contributed to a new level of understanding and appreciation of his works</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Zeller, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>180–181&lt;/ref&gt;By the time of Hesse's death in 1962, his works were still relatively little-read in the United States, despite his status as a Nobel laureate</span>
				<span class='text'>A memorial published in the ''[[New York Times]]'' went so far as to claim that Hesse's works were largely &quot;inaccessible&quot; for American readers</span>
				<span class='text'>The situation changed in the mid-1960s, when Hesse's works suddenly became bestsellers in the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=z185&gt;Zeller, p</span>
				<span class='text'>185&lt;/ref&gt; The revival in popularity of Hesse's works has been credited to their association with some of the popular themes of the 1960s [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] (or hippie) movement</span>
				<span class='text'>In particular, the quest-for-enlightenment theme of ''[[Siddhartha (novel)|Siddhartha]]'', ''[[Journey to the East]]'', and ''[[Narcissus and Goldmund]]'' resonated with those espousing counter-cultural ideals</span>
				<span class='text'>The &quot;magic theatre&quot; sequences in ''[[Steppenwolf (novel)|Steppenwolf]]'' were interpreted by some as drug-induced [[psychedelia]], although there is no evidence that Hesse ever took psychedelic drugs or recommended their use</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Zeller p</span>
				<span class='text'>189&lt;/ref&gt; To a large part, the  Hesse boom in the United States can be traced back to enthusiastic writings by two influential counter-culture figures: [[Colin Wilson]] and [[Timothy Leary]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Zeller, p</span>
				<span class='text'>188&lt;/ref&gt; From the United States, the Hesse renaissance spread to other parts of the world, and even back to Germany: more than 800,000 copies were sold in the German-speaking world in 1972–1973</span>
				<span class='text'>In a space of just a few years, Hesse became the most widely read and translated European author of the 20th century</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=z185/&gt; Hesse was especially popular among young readers, a tendency which continues today</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Zeller p</span>
				<span class='text'>186&lt;/ref&gt;There is a quote from ''[[Demian]]'' on the cover of [[Santana (band)|Santana]]'s 1970 album ''[[Abraxas]]'', revealing the source of the album's title</span>
				<span class='text'>esse's ''Siddhartha'' is one of the most popular Western novels set in India</span>
				<span class='text'>An authorized translation of ''Siddhartha'' was published in the Malayalam language in 1990, the language that surrounded Hesse's grandfather, Hermann Gundert, for most of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>A Hermann Hesse Society of India has also been formed</span>
				<span class='text'>It aims to bring out authentic translations of ''Siddhartha'' in all Indian languages and has already prepared the Sanskrit translation of ''Siddhartha''</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=November 2013}}One enduring monument to Hesse's lasting popularity in the United States is the [[Magic Theatre]] in [[San Francisco]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Referring to &quot;The Magic Theatre for Madmen Only&quot; in ''Steppenwolf'' (a kind of spiritual and somewhat nightmarish cabaret attended by some of the characters, including Harry Haller), the Magic Theatre was founded in 1967 to perform works by new playwrights</span>
				<span class='text'> Founded by John Lion, the Magic Theatre has fulfilled that mission for many years, including the world premieres of many plays by Sam Shepard</span>
				<span class='text'>here is also a theater in Chicago named after the novel, [[Steppenwolf Theatre Company|Steppenwolf Theater]]</span>
				<span class='text'>hroughout Germany, many schools are named after him</span>
