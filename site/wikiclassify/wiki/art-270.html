				<span class='text'>He spent the majority of his career playing for the [[History of the Baltimore Colts|Baltimore Colts]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Attending [[St</span>
				<span class='text'>Justin's High School]] in Pittsburgh, Unitas played [[halfback (American football)|halfback]] and quarterback</span>
				<span class='text'>After high school, Unitas looked for an opportunity to play college football</span>
				<span class='text'>he [[University of Louisville]] came through and Unitas left home for [[Kentucky]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=College career==In his younger years, Unitas dreamt about being part of the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame but when he tried out for them, the coach simply said that he was just too skinny and he'd &quot;get murdered&quot; if he was put on the field</span>
				<span class='text'>n his four-year career as a [[Louisville Cardinals|Louisville Cardinal]], Unitas completed 245 passes for 3,139 yards and 27 touchdowns</span>
				<span class='text'> Reportedly, the 6-foot-1 Unitas weighed 145 pounds on his first day of practice at Louisville</span>
				<span class='text'>Unitas' first start was in the fifth game of the 1951 season against St</span>
				<span class='text'>Bonaventure</span>
				<span class='text'>That game, the freshman threw 11 consecutive passes and three touchdowns to give the Cardinals a 21–19 lead</span>
				<span class='text'>Though Louisville lost the game 22–21 on a disputed field goal, it had found a talented quarterback</span>
				<span class='text'>Unitas completed 12 of 19 passes for 240 yards and four touchdowns in a 35–28 victory over Houston</span>
				<span class='text'>The team finished the season 5–5 overall and 4–1 with Unitas as the starting quarterback</span>
				<span class='text'>As a freshman, Unitas completed 46 of 99 passes for 602 yards and nine touchdowns (44)</span>
				<span class='text'>y the 1952 season, the university decided to de-emphasize sports</span>
				<span class='text'>The new president at Louisville, Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip Grant Davidson, reduced the amount of athletic aid, and tightened academic standards for athletes</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, 15 returning players could not meet the new standards and lost their scholarships</span>
				<span class='text'>But Unitas maintained his scholarship by taking on a new elective: square dancing</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1952 Coach Camp switched the team to [[two-way football]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Unitas not only played [[Safety (American football position)|safety]] or linebacker on defense and quarterback on offense but returned kicks and punts on special teams</span>
				<span class='text'>The Cards won their first game against Wayne State, and then Florida State in the second game</span>
				<span class='text'>Unitas completed 16 of 21 passes for 198 yards and three touchdowns</span>
				<span class='text'>It was said that Unitas put on such a show at the Florida State game that he threw a pass under his legs for 15 yards</span>
				<span class='text'>The rest of the season was a struggle for the Cards, who finished 3–5</span>
				<span class='text'>Unitas completed 106 of 198 passes for 1,540 yards and 12 touchdowns in his sophomore year</span>

				<span class='text'>One of the most memorable games of the season came in a 59–6 loss against Tennessee</span>
				<span class='text'>Unitas completed 9 of 19 passes for 73 yards, rushed 9 times for 52 yards, returned 6 kickoffs for eighty-five yards, 1 punt for three yards, and had 86 percent of the team's tackles</span>
				<span class='text'>The only touchdown the team scored was in the fourth quarter when Unitas made a fake pitch to the running back and ran the ball 23 yards for a [[touchdown]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Unitas was hurt later in the fourth quarter while trying to run the ball</span>
				<span class='text'>On his way off the field, he received a standing ovation</span>
				<span class='text'>When he got to the locker room he was so worn that his jersey and shoulder pads had to be cut off because he could not lift his arms</span>
				<span class='text'>Louisville ended the season with a 20–13 loss to Eastern Kentucky</span>
				<span class='text'>In his junior year, Unitas completed 49 of 95 passes for 470 yards and three touchdowns</span>
				<span class='text'>nitas was elected captain for the 1954 season, but due to an early injury did not see much playing time</span>
				<span class='text'>His first start was the third game of the season, against Florida State</span>
				<span class='text'>Of the 34-man team, 21 were freshmen</span>
				<span class='text'>The 1954 m Cardinals went 3–6, with their last win at home against Morehead State</span>
				<span class='text'>Unitas was slowed by so many injuries his senior year his 527 passing yards ended second to Jim Houser's 560</span>
				<span class='text'>=Professional career=====Pittsburgh Steelers===After college, the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] of the NFL drafted Unitas in the ninth round</span>
				<span class='text'> However, Unitas was released before the season began as the odd man out among four quarterbacks trying to fill three spots</span>
				<span class='text'>Steelers Head Coach [[Walt Kiesling]] had made up his mind about Unitas; he thought he was not smart enough to quarterback an NFL team,&lt;ref&gt;Dan Rooney: My 75 years with the Pittsburgh Steelers and the NFL, ISBN 0-306-81569-9; p</span>
				<span class='text'>62</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and Unitas was not given any snaps in practice with the Steelers</span>
				<span class='text'>Among those edging out Unitas was [[Ted Marchibroda]], future NFL quarterback and longtime NFL head coach</span>
				<span class='text'>Out of pro football, Unitas—by this time married—worked in construction in Pittsburgh to support his family</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;MacCambridge, 2005 pg</span>
				<span class='text'>124&lt;/ref&gt; On the weekends, he played quarterback, safety and punter on a local [[semi-professional]] team called the Bloomfield Rams for $6 a game</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cavanaugh, 2008 pg</span>
				<span class='text'>166&lt;/ref&gt;===Baltimore Colts===In 1956, Unitas joined the [[History of the Baltimore Colts|Baltimore Colts]] of the NFL under legendary coach [[Weeb Ewbank]], after being asked at the last minute to join Bloomfield Rams lineman Jim Deglau, a Croatian steel worker with a life much like Unitas', at the latter's scheduled Colts tryout</span>
				<span class='text'>The pair borrowed money from friends to pay for the gas to make the trip</span>
				<span class='text'>Deglau later told a reporter after Unitas' death, &quot;[His] uncle told him not to come</span>
				<span class='text'>[He] was worried that if he came down and the Colts passed on him, it would look bad (to other NFL teams)</span>

				<span class='text'>In his first serious action, Unitas' initial pass was intercepted and returned for a touchdown</span>
				<span class='text'>Then he botched a hand-off on his next play, a fumble recovered by the Bears</span>
				<span class='text'>Unitas rebounded quickly from that 58–27 loss, leading the Colts to an upset of [[Green Bay Packers|Green Bay]] and their first win over Cleveland</span>
				<span class='text'>He threw nine touchdown passes that year, including one in the season finale that started his record 47-game streak</span>
				<span class='text'>His 55</span>
				<span class='text'>-percent completion mark was a rookie record</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1957, his first season as the Colts full-time starter at quarterback, Unitas finished first in the NFL in passing yards (2,550) and touchdown passes (24) as he helped lead the Colts to a 7–5 record, the first winning record in franchise history</span>
				<span class='text'>At season's end, Unitas was named the [[NFL MVP|NFL's Most Valuable Player]] by the [[Newspaper Enterprise Association]] (NEA)</span>
				<span class='text'>===1958: &quot;The Greatest Game Ever Played&quot;====Unitas continued his prowess in 1958 passing for 2007 yards and 19 touchdowns as the Colts won the Western Conference title</span>
				<span class='text'>The Colts won the [[NFL championship]] under Unitas' leadership on December 28, 1958, by defeating the [[New York Giants]] 23–17 in [[sudden death (sport)|sudden death]] overtime</span>
				<span class='text'>It was the first overtime game in NFL history, and is often referred to as the &quot;[[1958 NFL Championship Game|greatest game ever played]]</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The game, nationally televised by [[NBC]], has been credited for sparking the rise in popularity of professional football during the 1960s</span>
				<span class='text'>===First MVP in 1959====In 1959, Unitas was named the NFL's MVP by the [[Associated Press]] (AP) and [[UPI]] (See: [[National Football League Most Valuable Player Award]]) for the first time, leading the NFL in passing yards (2,899), touchdown passes (32) and completions (193)</span>
				<span class='text'>Unitas then led the Colts to a repeat championship, beating the Giants again 31–16 in the title game</span>
				<span class='text'>he AP Award was considered the MVP award, adopting that verbiage in 1961</span>
				<span class='text'>The Associated Press had always called the pre-1961 'Players of the Year&quot;' their MVP until 2008, when it was revealed to them that they had made certain errors in their listings, namely that [[Jim Brown]] was the 1958 MVP/Player of the Year rather than Gino Marchetti and that Unitas was the true winner in 1959, not [[Y</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Tittle]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Rather than correct the winners, the AP &quot;disavowed&quot; that the pre-1961 winners were indeed &quot;MVPs&quot; claiming that it was a different award</span>
				<span class='text'>Nonetheless, UPI also voted Unitas the top player award and there is little doubt that through sports history &quot;MVP&quot; and &quot;Player of the Year&quot; are terms that are interchangeable</span>
				<span class='text'>===Beginning of the 1960s====As the 1960s began, the Colts' fortunes (and win totals) declined</span>
				<span class='text'>Injuries to key players such as [[Alan Ameche]], [[Raymond Berry]] and [[Lenny Moore]] were a contributing factor</span>

				<span class='text'>rg]&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of this, Unitas topped the 3000 yard passing mark for the first time and lead the league in touchdown passes for the fourth consecutive season</span>
				<span class='text'>fter three middle-of-the-pack seasons, Colts owner [[Carroll Rosenbloom]] fired Weeb Ewbank and replaced him with [[Don Shula]], who at the time was the youngest head coach in NFL history (33 years of age when he was hired)</span>
				<span class='text'>The Colts finished 8–6 in Shula's first season at the helm, good enough for only third place in the NFL's Western Conference but they did end the season on a strong note by winning their final three games</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;sportsecyclopedia</span>
				<span class='text'>om&quot;/&gt; The season was very successful for Unitas personally as he led the NFL in passing yards with a career-best total of 3,481 and also led in completions with 237</span>
				<span class='text'>===Second MVP in 1964====The [[1964 Baltimore Colts season|1964 season]] would see the Colts return to the top of the Western Conference</span>
				<span class='text'>After dropping their season opener to the Vikings, the Colts ran off 10 straight victories to finish with a 12–2 record</span>
				<span class='text'>The season was one of Unitas' best as he finished with 2,824 yards passing, a league-best 9</span>
				<span class='text'>6 yards per pass attempt, 19 touchdown passes and only 6 interceptions</span>
				<span class='text'>He was named the NFL's Most Valuable Player by the AP and UPI for a second time</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the season would end on a disappointing note for the Colts as they were upset by the Cleveland Browns in the [[1964 NFL Championship Game]], losing 27–0</span>
				<span class='text'>nitas resumed his torrid passing in 1965, as he threw for 2,530 yards, 23 touchdowns and finished with a league-high and career best 97</span>
				<span class='text'> passer rating</span>
				<span class='text'>But he was lost for the balance of the season due to a knee injury in a week 12 loss to the Bears</span>
				<span class='text'>More postseason heartbreak would follow in 1965</span>
				<span class='text'>The Colts and Packers finished in a tie for first place in the Western Conference and a one-game [[1965 NFL playoffs|playoff]] was played in Green Bay to decide who would be the conference representative in the [[1965 NFL Championship Game]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Colts lost in overtime 13–10 due in large part to a game-tying field goal by [[Don Chandler]] that many say was incorrectly ruled good</span>
				<span class='text'>Backup quarterback [[Gary Cuozzo]] also suffered a season-ending injury the following week and it would be running back [[Tom Matte]] who filled in as the emergency QB for the regular-season finale and the playoff loss to the Packers</span>
				<span class='text'>nitas, healthy once more, threw for 2748 yards and 22 touchdowns in 1966 in a return to [[Pro Bowl]] form</span>
				<span class='text'>However he posted a league-high 24 interceptions</span>
				<span class='text'>===Third MVP in 1967====After once again finishing 2nd in the Western Conference in 1966, the Colts rebounded to finish 11–1–2 in 1967 tying the Los Angeles Rams for the NFL's best record</span>
				<span class='text'>In winning his third MVP awards from the AP and UPI in 1967 (and his second from the NEA), Unitas had a league-high 58</span>
