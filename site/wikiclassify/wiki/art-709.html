				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;== Life ==The son of Aglaos, Eratosthenes was born in 276 BC, in [[Cyrene (city)|Cyrene]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Now part of modern-day [[Libya]], Cyrene had been founded by the Greeks centuries earlier, and became the capital of [[Pentapolis (North Africa)]], a country of five cities: Cyrene, Arsinde, [[Berenice]], Ptolemias, and [[Apollonia, Cyrenaica]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Alexander the Great]] conquered Cyrene in 332 BC, and following his death in 323 BC its rule was given to one of his generals, [[Ptolemy I Soter]], the founder of the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Under Ptolemaic rule the economy prospered, based largely on the export of horses and [[silphium]], a plant used for rich seasoning and medicine</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Roller, Duane W 2010&quot;/&gt; Cyrene became a place of cultivation, where knowledge blossomed</span>
				<span class='text'>Like any young Greek, Eratosthenes would have studied in the local [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]], where he would have learned physical skills and social discourse as well as reading, writing, arithmetic, poetry, and music</span>

				<span class='text'>He also studied under the head of the [[Platonic Academy]], who was [[Arcesilaus of Pitane]]</span>

				<span class='text'>He wrote poems: one in [[hexameter]]s called ''Hermes'' illustrating the god's life history; and another, in [[elegiac]]s, called ''Erigone'', describing the suicide of the Athenian maiden [[Erigone (daughter of Icarius)]]</span>

				<span class='text'>&quot;Eratosthenes of Cyrene&quot; in ''Dictionary Of World Biography: The Ancient World'' (January 1998): 1–3</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He wrote ''Chronographies'', a text that scientifically depicted dates of importance, beginning with the [[Trojan War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This work was highly esteemed for its accuracy: [[George Syncellus]] was later able to preserve from ''Chronographies'' a list of 38 kings of the [[Egyptian Thebes]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Eratosthenes also wrote ''Olympic Victors'', a chronology of the winners of the Olympic Games</span>
				<span class='text'>It is not known when he wrote his works, but they highlighted his abilities</span>
				<span class='text'>hese works and his great poetic abilities led the pharaoh [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]] to seek to place him as a librarian at the [[Library of Alexandria]] in the year 245 BC</span>
				<span class='text'>Eratosthenes, then thirty years old, accepted Ptolemy's invitation and traveled to Alexandria, where he lived for the rest of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>Within about five years he became Chief Librarian, a position that the poet [[Apollonius Rhodius]] had previously held</span>
				<span class='text'>As head of the library Eratosthenes tutored the children of Ptolemy, including [[Ptolemy IV Philopator]] who became the fourth Ptolemaic pharaoh</span>
				<span class='text'>He expanded the library's holdings: in Alexandria all books had to be surrendered for duplication</span>
				<span class='text'>It was said that these were copied so accurately that it was impossible to tell if the library had returned the copy or the original</span>
				<span class='text'>e sought to maintain the reputation of the Library of Alexandria against competition from the [[Pergamum]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Eratosthenes created a whole section devoted to the examination of Homer, and acquired original works of great tragic dramas of [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]]</span>

				<span class='text'>&quot;Eratosthenes of Cyrene&quot; Dictionary Of World Biography: The Ancient World, January 1998</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Eratosthenes made several important contributions to [[mathematics]] and [[science]], and was a friend of [[Archimedes]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Around 255&amp;nbsp;BC, he invented the [[armillary sphere]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''On the Circular Motions of the Celestial Bodies'', [[Cleomedes]] credited him with having calculated the [[Equator#Exact length of the Equator|Earth's circumference]] around 240 BC, using knowledge of the angle of [[Solar elevation angle|elevation]] of the [[Sun]] at noon on the [[summer solstice]] in Alexandria and on [[Elephantine]] Island near [[Syene]] (now [[Aswan]], Egypt)</span>

				<span class='text'>Using a [[gnomon]], he measured the Sun's angle of elevation at noon on the solstice in Alexandria, and found it to be 1/50th of a circle (7°12') south of the [[zenith]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He may have used a compass to measure the angle of the shadow cast by the Sun</span>

				<span class='text'>He was nicknamed Beta, because he was great at many things and tried to get his hands on every bit of information, but never achieved the highest rank in anything, so much so that [[Strabo]] accounts Eratosthenes as a mathematician among geographers, and a geographer among mathematicians</span>

				<span class='text'>rg/fathers/eusebius_pe_15_book15</span>
				<span class='text'>tm Book XV], Chapter 53)</span>
				<span class='text'>He states simply that Eratosthenes found the distance to the Sun to be &quot;{{lang|grc|σταδίων μυριάδας τετρακοσίας καὶ ὀκτωκισμυρίας}}&quot; (literally &quot;of [[Stadia (length)|stadia]] [[myriad]]s 400 and 80,000&quot;) and the distance to the Moon to be 780,000 stadia</span>
				<span class='text'>The expression for the distance to the Sun has been translated either as 4,080,000 stadia (1903 translation by E</span>
				<span class='text'>H</span>
				<span class='text'>Gifford), or as 804,000,000 stadia (edition of Edouard des Places, dated 1974–1991)</span>
				<span class='text'>The meaning depends on whether Eusebius meant 400 myriad plus 80,000 or &quot;400 and 80,000&quot; myriad</span>
				<span class='text'>With a stade of 185 meters, 804,000,000 stadia is 149,000,000 kilometers, approximately the distance from the Earth to the Sun</span>
				<span class='text'> Eratosthenes also calculated the Sun's diameter</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Macrobious, Eratosthenes made the diameter of the Sun to be about 27 times that of the Earth</span>

				<span class='text'>]{{main|Sieve of Eratosthenes|primality test}}Eratosthenes proposed a simple [[algorithm]] for finding [[prime numbers]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This algorithm is known in mathematics as the [[Sieve of Eratosthenes]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n mathematics, the sieve of Eratosthenes (Greek: κόσκινον Ἐρατοσθένους), one of a number of [[Generating primes#Prime sieves|prime number sieves]], is a simple, ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit</span>
				<span class='text'>It does so by iteratively marking as composite, ''i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>', not prime, the multiples of each prime, starting with the multiples of 2</span>
				<span class='text'>The multiples of a given prime are generated starting from that prime, as a sequence of numbers with the same difference, equal to that prime, between consecutive numbers</span>
				<span class='text'>This is the sieve's key distinction from using trial division to sequentially test each candidate number for divisibility by each prime</span>
