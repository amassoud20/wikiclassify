				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Higham|Moseley|1990|p=1}} He was the second child of Elias James Leach (1866–1935) and Elsie Maria Leach (née Kingdon; 1878–1973)</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Eliot|2004|pp=24, 365}} His father, the son of a potter, worked as a tailor's presser at a clothes factory named Todd's, while his mother, who also worked at the factory as a seamstress, was from a family of shipwrights</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfnm|1a1=Eliot|1y=2004|1p=24|2a1=Higham|2a2=Moseley|2y=1990|2p=2}} Biographers [[Charles Higham (biographer)|Charles Higham]] and [[Roy Moseley]] describe Elias as &quot;delicately and weakly handsome, with light brown curly hair, soft, dark reflective eyes, chiseled cheekbones, and a sensual mouth decorated with a neat mustache&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Higham|Moseley|1990|p=2}} They state that though evidence is lacking, a number of authors believe that his mother was of Jewish origin, considering it unusual that Archie was circumsised at a time when it was &quot;almost unknown&quot; in Britain</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Higham|Moseley|1990|p=xii}} Grant himself stated that the reason was because his father was partly Jewish, despite the lack of genealogical evidence</span>
				<span class='text'>{Efn|Grant turned down a leading role in ''[[Gentleman's Agreement]]'' in the 1940s because he believed he could not effectively play the part, being Jewish</span>
				<span class='text'>He donated considerable sums to Jewish causes over his lifetime, and in 1939 gave Jewish actor [[Sam Jaffe]] $25,000</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1947 he gave the same figure to the state of Israel, contradicting his other claim of paternal Jewish ancestry by declaring that it was &quot;in the name of his dead mother&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Higham|Moseley|1990|p=3}}}} It is also possible that he had Spanish or gypsy ancestry</span>

				<span class='text'>His father was an alcoholic,{{Sfn|Klein|2009|p=32}} and his mother suffered from [[clinical depression]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Weiten|1996|p=291}} Higham and Moseley claim that Archie grew up resenting his mother, and describe her as a &quot;cruel and despotic human being&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Higham|Moseley|1990|p=xiii}} They believe that her hostility was triggered by the fact that she had lost an earlier child, and that Archie was taking his place</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Higham|Moseley|1990|p=4}} She would prevent Archie from being given pocket money at the least little mishap, whether it was scratching a table or misplacing a cushion</span>
				<span class='text'>Grant later noted that he was kept in infant's clothing much longer than usual, and that for a period he &quot;wasn't sure whether I was a boy or a girl&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Higham|Moseley|1990|p=4}} Due to his father's alcoholism, he had a poor reputation locally, and the family moved house twice before Archie was five years of age, both in the nearby Bristol suburb of [[Bishopston, Bristol|Bishopston]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Higham|Moseley|1990|p=3}} To escape his parents, he spent much time in the company of his paternal uncle John (Jack), and illiterate grandmother Elizabeth at Picton Street</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Higham|Moseley|1990|p=5}} His father later placed his mother in [[Glenside,_Bristol|Glenside Hospital]] (a [[mental institution]]) and told the 9-year-old that she had gone away on a &quot;long holiday&quot;,{{sfn|Vermilye|1973|p=13}} later declaring that she had died</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Klein|2009|p=32}} When Archie was 10, his father remarried and started a new family that did not include young Archibald</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;SMH&quot;/&gt; Archie did not learn his mother had not died until he was 31,{{sfn|Connolly|2014|p=209}} when his father confessed to the lie, shortly before his own death, and told Leach that he could find her alive in a care facility</span>

				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Higham|Moseley|1990|p=5}} Due to alienation from his parents, he was socially inept as a child, with a nervous disposition</span>
				<span class='text'>He enjoyed the theatre, particularly pantomimes at Christmas which he would attend with his father</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Higham|Moseley|1990|p=6}} Elias frequently flirted with the showgirls backstage, and at the age of six and a half, Archie befriended a troupe of acrobatic dancers, known as &quot;The Penders&quot; or the &quot;Bob Pender Stage Troupe&quot;, and began performing with them</span>
				<span class='text'>One of the dancers, Robert Lomas, whom he would later closely resemble, became an early role model for him</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Higham|Moseley|1990|pp=7-8}} Elias noticed that the two shared a bond, and when his father left and remarried, he placed him in the full-time care of Lomas and the troupe</span>
				<span class='text'>Lomas nurtured him as a performer, despite him being underage</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Higham|Moseley|1990|p=9}} Archie began touring with the troupe from the age of six</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Higham|Moseley|1990|p=9}} One two-week stint at the [[Wintergarten]] in Berlin had a profound impact on young Archie,{{Sfn|Higham|Moseley|1990|p=10}} and he subsequently trained as a [[stilt walker]] for the troupe</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Miniter|2013|p=194}} In his first year with the troupe, he performed in the ''[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]'' Christmas pantomime at [[Drury Lane]]'s [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Theatre Royal]], donning a bird mask and appearing as a [[stork]]</span>

				<span class='text'>In one nine-minute segment of a three-hour show at the [[Folies Bergère Theater]], the first dinner theater in the United States, they performed in front of the likes of [[Diamond Jim Brady]], [[Lillian Russell]] and the Mellon, Rockefeller and Vanderbilt families</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Higham|Moseley|1990|pp=14-15}} The show eventually began to lose money, and the troupe receive negative press for their vulgarity, leaving Archie feeling disappointed upon his return to England in the September</span>
				<span class='text'>He developed a love of comedy, attending shows by the likes of [[John Bunny]] and [[Mabel Normand]] on Saturdays evenings in London</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Higham|Moseley|1990|p=17}} In January 1914 his father took him to see [[Fanny Brice]] appear in the revue ''[[Hello, Ragtime]]'' at the [[Prince's Theatre]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{{Sfn|Higham|Moseley|1990|p=18}} The same year, he won a scholarship to attend [[Fairfield Grammar School]] in Bristol, his father barely scraping together enough money to pay for his uniform</span>
				<span class='text'>He started at the school on September 2, 1915, and with his good looks and acrobatic talents he became a popular figure among both girls and boys, who affectionately referred to him as &quot;Gussie&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Higham|Moseley|1990|p=18}} Though he was able at most academic subjects and excelled at sports, particularly &quot;fives&quot;, similar to squash but with gloves, he developed a reputation for mischief, and frequently refused to do his homework</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Higham|Moseley|1990|pp=19-20}} His evenings were spent working backstage in the Bristolian theatres, and in 1917 he was responsible for the lighting for the magician [[David Devant]] at the Hippodrome</span>
				<span class='text'>A mishap occurred during the &quot;Magic Mirror&quot; segment of the show in which Archie revealed a girl hiding by misplaced lighting, which led to him being fired</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Higham|Moseley|1990|pp=20-21}}In March 1918, Archie was expelled from Fairfield</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Fells|2015|p=105}} Several explanations were given, from him being found in the girls' lavatory to being found guilty of theft, along with two other classmates, in the nearby town of [[Almondsbury]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Higham|Moseley|1990|p=22}} Higham and Moseley believe that the real reason was that he stole a valise full of paints, which is self-referenced for good humor in ''[[The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Higham|Moseley|1990|p=22}} Without school to attend, Archie rejoined the Pender Troupe, giving nightly performances at the Norwich Hippodrome from May 13 to May 18 1918, and then the Ipswich Hippodrome for two days until May 25</span>
				<span class='text'>During that summer the troupe performed in [[Aldershot]] and toured northern England and southern Scotland, including [[Aberdeen]] and [[Dundee]], before returning to Bristol in the September</span>
