				<span class='text'>Fonda decided to quit his job and go East in 1928 to seek his fortune</span>

				<span class='text'>e starred with ex-wife Margaret Sullavan in ''[[The Moon's Our Home]]'', and a short rekindling of their relationship led to a brief but temporary consideration of remarriage</span>
				<span class='text'> Fonda got the nod for the lead role in ''[[You Only Live Once (film)|You Only Live Once]]'' (1937), also costarring Sidney, and directed by [[Fritz Lang]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a critical success opposite [[Bette Davis]], who had picked him, in the film ''[[Jezebel (film)|Jezebel]]'' (1938)</span>
				<span class='text'> This was followed by the title role in ''[[Young Mr</span>
