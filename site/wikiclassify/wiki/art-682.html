				<span class='text'>Pound|Ezra Pound in 1963]] --&gt;'''Ezra Weston Loomis Pound''' (30 October 1885&amp;nbsp;– 1 November 1972) was an [[expatriate]] American poet and critic who was a major figure in the early [[Modernist poetry|modernist]] movement</span>
				<span class='text'>His contribution to poetry began with his development of [[Imagism]], a movement derived from classical [[Chinese poetry|Chinese]] and [[Japanese poetry]], stressing clarity, precision and economy of language</span>
				<span class='text'>His best-known works include ''[[Ripostes]]'' (1912), ''[[Hugh Selwyn Mauberley]]'' (1920) and the unfinished 120-section epic, ''[[The Cantos]]'' (1917–69)</span>
				<span class='text'>orking in London in the early 20th century as foreign editor of several American literary magazines, Pound helped discover and shape the work of contemporaries such as [[T</span>
				<span class='text'>S</span>
				<span class='text'>Eliot]], [[James Joyce]], [[Robert Frost]], and [[Ernest Hemingway]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was responsible for the 1915 publication of Eliot's &quot;[[The Love Song of J</span>
				<span class='text'>Alfred Prufrock]]&quot; and the serialization from 1918 of Joyce's ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Hemingway wrote of him in 1925: &quot;He defends [his friends] when they are attacked, he gets them into magazines and out of jail</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>He introduces them to wealthy women</span>
				<span class='text'>He gets publishers to take their books</span>
				<span class='text'>He sits up all night with them when they claim to be dying&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>he advances them hospital expenses and dissuades them from suicide</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hemingway (2006), 5–6&lt;/ref&gt;Outraged by the carnage of [[World War I]], Pound lost faith in England and blamed the war on [[usury]] and international [[capitalism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He moved to [[Italy]] in 1924, and throughout the 1930s and 1940s he embraced [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Italian Fascism]], expressed support for [[Adolf Hitler]], and wrote for publications owned by British fascist [[Oswald Mosley]]</span>
				<span class='text'> During [[World War II]] he was paid by the Italian government to make hundreds of radio broadcasts criticizing the [[United States]], [[Franklin D</span>
				<span class='text'>Roosevelt]], and [[Jews]], as a result of which he was arrested by American forces in Italy in 1945 on charges of [[treason]], after which he spent months in detention in a U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>military camp in [[Pisa]], including three weeks in a six-by-six-foot outdoor steel cage that he said triggered a mental breakdown, &quot;when the raft broke and the waters went over me&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Deemed unfit to stand trial, he was incarcerated in [[St</span>
				<span class='text'>Elizabeths Hospital|St</span>
				<span class='text'>Elizabeths]] psychiatric hospital in Washington, D</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> for over 12 years</span>

				<span class='text'>65–67), Sieburth (2003), xiii&lt;/ref&gt;While in custody in Italy, he had begun work on sections of ''The Cantos'' that became known as ''[[The Cantos#LXXIV–LXXXIV (The Pisan Cantos)|The Pisan Cantos]]'' (1948), for which he was awarded the [[Bollingen Prize]] in 1949 by the Library of Congress, triggering enormous controversy</span>
				<span class='text'>He was released from St</span>
				<span class='text'>Elizabeths in 1958, thanks to a campaign by his fellow writers, and returned to live in Italy until his death</span>
				<span class='text'>His political views ensure that his work remains as controversial now as it was during his lifetime; in 1933 [[Time Magazine|''Time'' magazine]] called him &quot;a cat that walks by himself, tenaciously unhousebroken and very unsafe for children&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Hemingway wrote: &quot;The best of Pound's writing – and it is in the ''Cantos'' – will last as long as there is any literature</span>

				<span class='text'>On his mother's side, Pound was descended from [[William Wadsworth (patriarch)|William Wadsworth]] (1594–1675), a [[Puritanism|Puritan]] who emigrated from England to Boston on the ''[[English ship Lion (1557)|Lion]]'' in 1632</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 11&lt;/ref&gt; The Wadsworths married into the Westons of New York</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name =&quot;Cockram238&quot;/&gt;On his father's side, the immigrant ancestor was John Pound, a [[Quaker]] who arrived from England around 1650</span>
				<span class='text'>Ezra's grandfather, [[Thaddeus C</span>
				<span class='text'>Pound|Thaddeus Coleman Pound]] (1832–1914), was a retired [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Congressman for northwest [[Wisconsin]] who had made and lost a fortune in the lumber business</span>
				<span class='text'>Thaddeus's son Homer, Pound's father, worked for Thaddeus in the lumber business, until Thaddeus secured him the appointment as registrar of the Hailey land office</span>
				<span class='text'>Homer and Isabel married the following year, and Homer built for her [[Homer Pound House|a home in Hailey]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Moodyxiii&gt;Moody (2007), xiii–13&lt;/ref&gt; Isabel was unhappy in Hailey and took Ezra with her to New York in 1887 when he was 18 months old</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Moodyxiii/&gt;===Education===Pound's education began in a series of [[dame school]]s, some of them run by Quakers: Miss Elliott's school in Jenkintown in 1892, the Heathcock family's Chelten Hills School in Wyncote in 1893, and the Florence Ridpath school from 1894, also in Wyncote</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), xiii&lt;/ref&gt; His first publication (&quot;by E</span>
				<span class='text'>L</span>
				<span class='text'>Pound, Wyncote, aged 11 years&quot;) was a [[Limerick (poetry)|limerick]] in the ''Jenkintown Times-Chronicle'' about [[William Jennings Bryan]], who had just lost the [[United States presidential election, 1896|1896 presidential election]]: &quot;There was a young man from the West, / He did what he could for what he thought best; / But election came round, / He found himself drowned, / And the papers will tell you the rest</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rachewiltz, Moody and Moody (2011), x; the limerick was published on 7 November 1896</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Between 1897 and 1900 Pound attended Cheltenham Military Academy, sometimes as a boarder, where he specialized in [[Latin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The boys wore [[American Civil War|Civil War]]-style uniforms and besides Latin were taught English, history, arithmetic, marksmanship, military drilling and the importance of submitting to authority</span>
				<span class='text'>Pound made his first trip overseas in the summer of 1898 when he was 13, a three-month tour of Europe with his mother and Frances Weston (Aunt Frank), who took him to England, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland and Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; After the academy he may have attended Cheltenham Township High School for one year</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1901 at the age of 15, he was admitted to the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s College of Liberal Arts</span>

				<span class='text'>She developed as the poet known as [[H</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>] She followed him to Europe in 1908, leaving her family, friends and country for little benefit to herself, and became involved with Pound in developing the [[Imagism]] movement in London</span>
				<span class='text'>He sought her hand and in February that year asked her father, the astronomy professor Charles Doolittle, for his permission to marry</span>
				<span class='text'>Doolittle was a curt man, described as &quot;donnish&quot; and intimidating</span>
				<span class='text'>He was aware of Pound's reputation as a ladies' man, and unimpressed by his career as a poet, and constant moving</span>
				<span class='text'>Doolittle's response was dismissive, he replied, &quot;What! … Why you’re nothing but a nomad!&quot; Pound asked Hilda to marry him in the summer of 1907, and though rejected, wrote several poems for her between 1905 and 1907</span>
				<span class='text'>He hand-bound 25 of these, calling them ''Hilda's Book''</span>

				<span class='text'>He asked Mary to marry him that summer too, but she turned him down</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 24–28; for dedication of ''Personae'' see Nadel (1999), xviii&lt;/ref&gt;His parents and Frances Weston took him on another three-month European tour in 1902, after which he transferred, in 1903, to [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] in Clinton, New York, possibly because of poor grades</span>
				<span class='text'>Signed up for the Latin–Scientific course, he studied the [[Provençal dialect]] with William Pierce Shephard and [[Old English]] with Joseph D</span>
				<span class='text'>Ibbotson; with Shephard he read [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] and from this began the idea for a long poem in three parts&amp;nbsp;– of emotion, instruction and contemplation&amp;nbsp;– planting the seeds for ''The Cantos''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 18–25*He would later apply the form he imagined throughout the writing of the ''Cantos''</span>
				<span class='text'>See Moody (2007), 24&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating in 1905 with a PhB, he studied [[Romance languages]] under Hugo A</span>
				<span class='text'>Rennert at the University of Pennsylvania, where he obtained an MA in the spring of 1906 and registered to write a PhD thesis on the jesters in [[Lope de Vega]]'s plays</span>
				<span class='text'>A Harrison fellowship covered his tuition fees and gave him a grant of $500, which he used to return to Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 19, 27–28&lt;/ref&gt;Pound spent three weeks in Madrid in various libraries, including one in the royal palace</span>
				<span class='text'>He happened to be standing outside the palace on 31 May 1906 during the attempted assassination by [[anarchism|anarchists]] of [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|King Alfonso]], and left the country for fear he would be identified with them</span>
				<span class='text'>After Spain he spent two weeks in Paris attending lectures at the [[Sorbonne]], followed by a week in London</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 28–29&lt;/ref&gt; In July he returned to the United States, where in September his first essay, &quot;Raphaelite Latin&quot;, was published in ''Book News Monthly''</span>
				<span class='text'>He took courses in the English department in 1907, where he annoyed Felix Schelling, the department head, with silly remarks during lectures, including that [[George Bernard Shaw]] was better than [[Shakespeare]], and wound an enormous tin watch very slowly while Schelling spoke</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, his fellowship was not renewed at the end of the year; Schelling told Pound that he was wasting his own time and that of the institution</span>
				<span class='text'>Pound left without finishing his doctorate</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 29–31&lt;/ref&gt;===Teaching===From the fall of 1907 Pound taught Romance languages at [[Wabash College]] in [[Crawfordsville, Indiana]], a conservative town that he called the [[Inferno (Dante)#Sixth Circle (Heresy)|sixth circle of hell]] and an equally conservative college from which he was dismissed after deliberately provoking the college authorities</span>
				<span class='text'>Smoking was forbidden, but he would smoke [[cigarillo]]s in his office down the corridor from the president's</span>
				<span class='text'>He annoyed his landlords by entertaining friends, including women, and was forced out of one house after two &quot;stewdents found me sharing my meagre repast with the lady–gent impersonator in my privut apartments,&quot; as he told a friend</span>
				<span class='text'>He was eventually caught ''[[In flagrante delicto|in flagrante]]'', although the details remain unclear and he denied any wrongdoing</span>
				<span class='text'>The incident involved a stranded chorus girl to whom he offered tea and his bed for the night when she was caught in a snowstorm; when she was discovered the next morning by the landladies, his insistence that he had slept on the floor was met with disbelief and he was asked to leave the college</span>
				<span class='text'>Glad to be free of the place, he left for Europe soon after, sailing from New York in March 1908</span>

				<span class='text'>By the end of April he was in [[Venice]], living over a bakery near the San Vio bridge</span>
				<span class='text'>In July he self-published his first book of poetry,  ''[[A Lume Spento]]'' (''With Tapers Spent''); the ''London Evening Standard'' called it &quot;wild and haunting stuff, absolutely poetic, original, imaginative, passionate, and spiritual</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The title was from the third canto of [[Dante]]'s ''[[Purgatorio]]'', which alluded to the death of [[Manfred, King of Sicily]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The book was dedicated to his friend, the Philadelphia artist [[William Brooke Smith]], who had recently died of [[tuberculosis]]</span>

				<span class='text'>]Pound was fascinated by the translations of [[Japanese poetry]] and [[Noh]] plays which he discovered in the papers of [[Ernest Fenollosa]], an American professor who had taught in Japan</span>
				<span class='text'>Fenollosa had studied Chinese poetry under Japanese scholars; in 1913 his widow, Mary McNeil Fenollosa, decided to give his unpublished notes to Pound after seeing his work; she was looking for someone who cared about poetry rather than philology</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 239&lt;/ref&gt; Pound edited and published Fenellosa's ''The Chinese Written Character as a Medium for Poetry'' in 1918</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The title page of the collection ''[[Cathay (poetry collection)|Cathay]]'' (1915), refers to the poet &quot;Rihaku&quot;, the pronunciation in Japanese of the [[Tang dynasty]] Chinese poet, [[Li Bai]], whose poems were much beloved in China and Japan for their technical mastery and much translated in the West because of their seeming simplicity</span>
				<span class='text'>The volume is in Alexander's view the most attractive  of Pound's work</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Alexander95&gt;Alexander (1979), 95&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese critic [[Wai-lim Yip]] writes of it: &quot;One can easily excommunicate Pound from the Forbidden City of Chinese studies, but it seems clear that in his dealings with ''Cathay'', even when he is given only the barest details, he is able to get into the central concerns of the original author by what we may perhaps call a kind of clairvoyance</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Alexander95/&gt; ''Cathay'' was the first of many translations Pound would make from the Chinese</span>
				<span class='text'>Pound used Fenollosa's work as a starting point for what he called the [[ideogrammic method]], which proceeded on Fenellosa's entirely mistaken but fruitful idea that each character represented an image or pictograph, based on sight rather than sound</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Graves, from &quot;These Be Your Gods, O Israel&quot; (138–139)&lt;/ref&gt; However, Steven Yao, scholar of American and Asian literature, sees ''Cathay'' as a &quot;major feat&quot;; a work where Pound shows that translation is possible without a thorough knowledge of the source language</span>
				<span class='text'>Yao does not view Pound's lack of Chinese as an obstacle, and states that the poet's trawl through centuries of scholarly interpretations resulted in a genuine understanding of the original poem</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;Nadel18&quot;/&gt;==Style==Critics generally agree that Pound was a strong yet subtle lyricist, particularly in his early work, such as &quot;The River Merchant's Wife&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;O'Connor (1963), 7, 19&lt;/ref&gt; According to Witmeyer a modern style is evident as early as ''Ripostes'', and Nadel sees evidence of modernism even before he began ''The Cantos'', writing that Pound wanted his poetry to represent an &quot;objective presentation of material which he believed could stand on its own&quot; without use of symbolism or romanticism</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Nadel19991&gt;Nadel (1999), 1–6; Witmeyer (1999), 47&lt;/ref&gt;Drawing on literature from a variety of disciplines, Pound intentionally layered often confusing juxtapositions, yet led the reader to an intended conclusion, believing the &quot;thoughtful man&quot; would apply a sense of organization and uncover the underlying symbolism and structure</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Coats (2009), 87–89&lt;/ref&gt; Ignoring Victorian and Edwardian grammar and structure, he created a unique form of speech, employing odd and strange words, jargon, avoiding verbs, and using rhetorical devices such as [[parataxis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Stark (2001) 10–12&lt;/ref&gt;Pound's relationship to music is essential to his poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he was tone deaf and his speaking voice is described as &quot;raucous, nasal, scratchy&quot;, Michael Ingam writes that Pound is on a short list of poets possessed of a sense of sound, an &quot;ear&quot; for words, imbuing his poetry with [[Ezra Pound's Three Kinds of Poetry|melopoeia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;Ingham236&quot;/&gt; His study of troubadour poetry&amp;nbsp;– words written to be sung (''motz et son'')&amp;nbsp;– led him to think modern poetry should be written similarly</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;Ingham236&quot;&gt;Ingham (1999), 236–237&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that rhythm is &quot;the hardest quality of a man's style to counterfeit&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pound (1968), 103&lt;/ref&gt; Ingham compares the form of ''The Cantos'' to a [[fugue]]; without adhering strictly to the traditions of the form, nevertheless multiple themes are explored simultaneously</span>
				<span class='text'>He goes on to write that Pound's use of [[counterpoint]] is integral to the structure and cohesion of ''The Cantos'', which show multi-voiced counterpoint and, with the juxtaposition of images, non-linear themes</span>
				<span class='text'>The pieces are presented in fragments &quot;which taken together, can be seen to unfold in time as music does&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ingham (1999), 244–245&lt;/ref&gt;===Imagism and Vorticism===[[File:EzraPound Ripostes</span>
				<span class='text'>ng|thumb|170px|alt=cover|[[Dorothy Shakespear]] designed the Vorticism-inspired [[cover art]] for Pound's 1915 ''Ripostes'']]Opinion varies about the nature of Pound's writing style</span>
				<span class='text'>Nadel writes that imagism was to change Pound's poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Nadel19991/&gt; Like Wyndham Lewis, Pound reacted against decorative flourishes found in Edwardian writing, saying poetry required a precise and economic use of language and that the poet should always use the &quot;exact&quot; word, stripping the writing down to the &quot;barest essence&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Oliver (2011), 87&lt;/ref&gt; According to Nadel, &quot;Imagism evolved as a reaction against abstraction&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>replacing Victorian generalities with the clarity in Japanese haiku and ancient Greek lyrics</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=Nadel19991/&gt; Daniel Albright writes that Pound tried to condense and eliminate &quot;all but the hardest kernel&quot; from a poem, such as in the two-line poem &quot;In a Station of the Metro&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;Albright60&quot;/&gt; However, Pound learned that Imagism did not lend itself well to the writing of an epic, so he turned to the more dynamic structure of Vorticism for ''The Cantos''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;Albright60&quot;&gt;Albright (1999), 60&lt;/ref&gt;===Translations===Pound's translations represent a substantial part of his work</span>
				<span class='text'>He began his career with translations of [[Occitan language|Occitan]] ballads and ended with translations of Egyptian poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>Yao says the body of translations by modernist poets in general, much of which Pound started, consists of some the most &quot;significant modernist achievements in English&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Yao (2010), 34–35&lt;/ref&gt; Pound was the first English language poet since [[John Dryden]], some three centuries earlier, to give primacy to translations in English literature</span>
				<span class='text'>The fullness of the achievement for the modernists is that they renewed interest in multiculturalism, multilingualism, and, perhaps of greater importance, they treated translations not in a strict sense of the word but instead saw a translation as the creation of an original work</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Yao (2010), 33–36&lt;/ref&gt;[[Michael J</span>
				<span class='text'>Alexander|Michael Alexander]] writes that, as a translator, Pound was a pioneer with a great gift of language and an incisive intelligence</span>
				<span class='text'>He helped popularize major poets such as [[Guido Cavalcanti]] and [[Du Fu]], and brought [[Occitan language|Provençal]] and Chinese poetry to English-speaking audiences</span>
				<span class='text'>He revived interest in the Confucian classics and introduced the west to classical Japanese poetry and drama</span>
				<span class='text'>He translated and championed Greek, Latin and Anglo-Saxon classics, and helped keep them alive at a time when poets no longer considered translations central to their craft</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Alexander (1997), 23–30&lt;/ref&gt;In Pound's Fenollosa translations, unlike previous American translators of Chinese poetry, which tended to work with strict [[metre (poetry)|metrical]] and [[stanza]]ic patterns, Pound created [[free verse]] translations</span>
				<span class='text'>Whether the poems are valuable as translations continues to be a source of controversy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Xie1999/&gt;  [[Hugh Kenner]] contends that ''Cathay'' should be read primarily as a work about World War I, not as an attempt at accurately translating ancient Eastern poems</span>
				<span class='text'>The real achievement of the book, Kenner argues, is in how it combines meditations on violence and friendship with an effort to &quot;rethink the nature of an English poem&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>These ostensible translations of ancient Eastern texts, Kenner argues, are actually experiments in English poetics and compelling elegies for a warring West</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Kenner199&gt;Kenner (1971), 199&lt;/ref&gt; Pound scholar Ming Xie explains that Pound's use of language in his translation of &quot;The Seafarer&quot; is deliberate, in that he avoids merely &quot;trying to assimilate the original into contemporary language&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Xie1999&gt;Xie (1999), 204–212&lt;/ref&gt;===''The Cantos''==={{further|List of cultural references in The Cantos}}{{Quote box |width=350px |align=right |quoted=true |bgcolor= #FFFFF0 |salign=right |quote=&lt;poem&gt;And then went down to the ship,Set keel to breakers, forth on the godly sea, andWe set up mast and sail on that swart ship,Bore sheep aboard her, and our bodies alsoHeavy with weeping, and winds from sternwardBore us out onward with bellying canvas,Circe's this craft, the trim-coifed goddess</span>

				<span class='text'>In the epic poem, Pound disregards literary genres, mixing satire, hymns, [[Elegy|elegies]], essays and memoirs</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name= &quot;Nadel1-6&quot;&gt;Nadel (1999), 1–6&lt;/ref&gt; Pound scholar Rebecca Beasley believes it amounts to a rejection of the 19th-century nationalistic approach in favor of early-20th-century [[comparative literature]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Pound reaches across cultures and time periods, assembling and juxtaposing &quot;themes and history&quot; from [[Homer]] to [[Ovid]] and [[Dante]], from [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[John Adams]], and many others</span>
				<span class='text'>The work presents a multitude of protagonists as &quot;travellers between nations&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The nature of ''The Cantos'', she says, is to compare and measure among historical periods and cultures and against &quot;a Poundian standard&quot; of modernism</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Beasley (2010), 662&lt;/ref&gt;  Pound layered ideas, cultures, and historical periods, juxtaposing modern [[vernacular]], Classical languages, and underlying truths, often represented with Chinese ideograms and as many as 15 different languages</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Xie (1999), 217&lt;/ref&gt;Ira Nadel says ''The Cantos'' is an [[Epic poetry|epic]], that is &quot;a poem including history&quot;, and that the &quot;historical figures lend referentiality to the text&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>It functions as a contemporary memoir, in which &quot;personal history [and] lyrical retrospection mingle&quot;&amp;nbsp;– most clearly represented in the ''Pisan Cantos''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name =&quot;Nadel1-6&quot;/&gt; Michael Ingham sees in ''The Cantos'' an American tradition of experimental literature writing about it,  &quot;These works include everything but the kitchen sink, and then add the kitchen sink&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ingham (1999), 240&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s William O'Connor described ''The Cantos'' as filled with &quot;cryptic and gnomic utterances, dirty jokes, obscenities of various sorts&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;O'Connor (1963), 7&lt;/ref&gt;[[Allen Tate]] believes the poem is not about anything and is without beginning, middle or end</span>
				<span class='text'>He argues that Pound was incapable of sustained thought and &quot;at the mercy of random flights of 'angelic insight,' an [[Icarians|Icarian]] self-indulgence of prejudice which is not checked by a total view to which it could be subordinated&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tate (1965), 87&lt;/ref&gt; This perceived lack of logical consistency or form is a common criticism of ''The Cantos''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Nadel (1999), 8&lt;/ref&gt; Pound himself felt this absence of form was his great failure, and regretted that he could not &quot;make it cohere&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Nicholls (1999), 144&lt;/ref&gt;===Literary criticism and economic theory===Pound's literary criticism and essays are, according to [[Massimo Bacigalupo]], a &quot;form of intellectual journal&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>In early works, such as ''The Spirit of Romance'' and &quot;I Gather the Limbs of Osiris&quot;, Pound paid attention to medieval [[troubadour]] poets&amp;nbsp;– [[Arnaut Daniel]] and [[François Villon]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The former piece was to &quot;remain one of Pound's principal sourcebooks for his poetry&quot;; in the latter he introduces the concept of &quot;luminous details&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bacigalupo (1999), 188–191&lt;/ref&gt; The [[leitmotif]]s in Pound's literary criticism are recurrent patterns found in historical events, which, he believed, through the use of judicious juxtapositions illuminate truth; and in them he reveals forgotten writers and cultures</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bacigalupo (1999), 203&lt;/ref&gt;Pound wrote intensively about economic theory with the ''ABC of Economics'' and ''Jefferson and/or Mussolini'', published in the mid-1930s right after he was introduced to Mussolini</span>
				<span class='text'>These were followed by ''The Guide to Kulchur''  &amp;nbsp;– covering 2500 years of history&amp;nbsp;– which [[Tim Redman]] describes as the &quot;most complete synthesis of Pound's political and economic thought&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Redman (1999), 258&lt;/ref&gt; Pound thought writing the cantos meant writing an epic about history and economics, and he wove his economic theories throughout; neither can be understood without the other</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Redman (1999), 255–260&lt;/ref&gt; In these pamphlets and in ''[[The ABC of Reading]]'', he sought to emphasize the value of art and to &quot;aestheticize the political&quot;&amp;nbsp;– written forcefully, according to Nadel, and in a &quot;determined voice&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Nadel (1999), 10&lt;/ref&gt; In form his criticism and essays are direct, repetitive and reductionist, his rhetoric minimalist, filled with &quot;strident impatience&quot;, according to Pound scholar Jason Coats, and frequently failing to make a coherent claim</span>
				<span class='text'>He rejected traditional rhetoric and created his own, although not very successfully, in Coats's view</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bacigalupo (1999), 203*For &quot;strident impatience&quot;, see Coats (2009), 80, and for &quot;not very successfully&quot;, 83&lt;/ref&gt;==Reception=====Critical reception===In 1922 the literary critic [[Edmund Wilson]] reviewed Pound's latest published volume of poetry, ''Poems 1918–21'', and took the opportunity to provide an overview of his estimation of Pound as poet</span>
				<span class='text'>In his essay on Pound, titled &quot;Ezra Pound's Patchwork&quot;, Wilson wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;Ezra Pound is really at heart a very boyish fellow and an incurable provincial</span>
				<span class='text'>It is true that he was driven to Europe by a thirst for romance and color that he could scarcely have satisfied in America, but he took to Europe the simple faith and pure enthusiasm of his native Idaho</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>His sophistication is still juvenile, his ironies are still clumsy and obvious, he ridicules Americans in Europe not very much simpler than himself&amp;nbsp;</span>

				<span class='text'>Library of America, 44, 45; the essay was first published on 19 April 1922</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;According to Wilson, the lines in Pound's poems stood isolated, with fragmentary wording contributing to poems that &quot;do not hang together&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Citing Pound's first seven cantos, Wilson dubbed the writing &quot;unsatisfactory&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He found ''The Cantos'' disjointed and its contents reflecting a too-obvious reliance on the literary works of other authors, and an awkward use of Latin and Chinese translations as a device inserted among reminiscences of Pound's own life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Wilson1922/&gt;The rise of [[New Criticism]] during the 1950s, in which author is separated from text, secured Pound's poetic reputation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Beasley (2010), 651&lt;/ref&gt; Nadel writes that the publication of T</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Eliot's ''Literary Essays'' in 1954 &quot;initiated the recuperation of Ezra Pound&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Eliot's essays coincided with the work of [[Hugh Kenner]], who visited Pound extensively at St</span>
				<span class='text'>Elizabeths</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name= &quot;Nadel12&quot;&gt;Nadel (1999), 12&lt;/ref&gt; Kenner wrote that there was no great contemporary writer less read than Pound, adding that there is also no one to appeal more through &quot;sheer beauty of language&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kenner (1983), 16&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Donald Davie]], Kenner brought a new appreciation to Pound's work in the 1960s and 1970s</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Alexander (1997), 15–18&lt;/ref&gt; Donald Gallup's Pound bibliography was published in 1963 and Kenner's ''The Pound Era'' in 1971</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name= &quot;Nadel12&quot;/&gt; In the 1970s a literary journal dedicated to Pound studies (''Paideuma'') was established, and Ronald Bush published the first dedicated critical study of ''The Cantos'', to be followed by a number of research editions of ''The Cantos''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name= &quot;Nadel12&quot;/&gt;Following Mullins' biography, described by Nadel as &quot;partisan&quot; and &quot;melodramatic&quot;, was Noel Stock's factual 1970 ''Life of Ezra Pound''&amp;nbsp;–  although the material included was subject to Dorothy's approval</span>
				<span class='text'>The 1980s saw three significant biographies: [[John Tytell]]'s &quot;neutral&quot; account in 1987, followed by Wilhelm's multi-volume biography</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Humphrey Carpenter]]'s sprawling narrative, a &quot;complete life&quot;, built on what Stock began; unlike Stock, Carpenter had the benefit of working without intervention from Pound's relatives</span>
				<span class='text'>In 2007 David Moody published the first of his multi-volume biography, combining narrative with literary criticism, the first work to link the two</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Nadel (2010b), 162–165&lt;/ref&gt;In the 1980s Mary de Rachewiltz released the first dual-language edition of ''The Cantos'', including &quot;Canto LXXII&quot; and &quot;Canto LXXIII&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name= &quot;Nadel13&quot;/&gt; These cantos had originally been published in fascist magazines, and are characterized by 21st-century literary scholars as no more than war-time propaganda</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Feldman (2012), 94&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 a complete facsimile edition of Pound's prose and poetry was published, now considered a &quot;fundamental research tool&quot;, according to Nadel</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name= &quot;Nadel13&quot;&gt;Nadel (1999), 13&lt;/ref&gt; Scholarship in the 1990s turned toward in-depth investigations of his antisemitism and Rome years</span>
				<span class='text'>Tim Redman writes about Pound's fascism and his relationship with Mussolini, and Leon Surrette about Pound's economic theories, especially during the Italian period, investigating how Pound the poet became Pound the fascist</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Coats (2009), 81&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 Surrette wrote about the state of Pound criticism, that &quot;the effort to uncover coherence in a&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>crazy quilt of verse styles, critical principles, crankish economic theories and distasteful political affiliations has made it difficult to perceive the genesis and development of any of these components</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He emphasized that Pound's &quot;economic and political opinions have not been properly dated, nor has the suddenness of his radicalization been appreciated</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Surrette (1999) 13&lt;/ref&gt;Nadel's 2010 ''Pound in Context'' is a contextual literary approach to Pound scholarship</span>
				<span class='text'>Pound's life, &quot;the social, political, historical, and literary developments of his period&quot;, is fully investigated, which, according to Nadel is &quot;the grid for reading Pound's poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Nadel (2010a), 1–6&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 Matthew Feldman wrote that the more than 1,500 documents in the &quot;Pound files&quot; held by the FBI have been ignored by scholars, and almost certainly contain evidence that &quot;Pound was politically cannier, was more bureaucratically involved with Italian Fascism, and was more involved with Mussolini's regime than has been posited&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Feldman (2012), 90–91&lt;/ref&gt;===Legacy===Pound helped advance the careers of some of the best-known modernist writers of the early 20th century</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bornstein (1999), 22–23&lt;/ref&gt; Hugh Witemeyer argues that the Imagist movement was the most important in 20th-century English-language poetry because it affected all the leading poets of Pound's generation and the two generations after him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Witemeyer (1999), 48&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917 [[Carl Sandburg]] wrote in ''Poetry'': &quot;All talk on modern poetry, by people who know, ends with dragging in Ezra Pound somewhere</span>
				<span class='text'>He may be named only to be cursed as wanton and mocker, poseur, trifler and vagrant</span>
