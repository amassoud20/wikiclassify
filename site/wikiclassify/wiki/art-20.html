				<span class='text'> Ashoka is now remembered as a philanthropic administrator</span>

				<span class='text'>It is from her exclamation I am now without sorrow that Ashoka got his name</span>

				<span class='text'>Ashoka had several elder siblings all of whom were his half brothers from other wives of Bindusara</span>
				<span class='text'>His fighting qualities were apparent from an early age and he was given royal military training</span>
				<span class='text'> He was known as a fearsome hunter and according to a legend killed a lion with just a wooden rod</span>
				<span class='text'>Because of his reputation as a frightening warrior and a heartless general he was sent to curb the riots in the  province of the Mauryan empire</span>
				<span class='text'>rachin bharoter itihas by Sunil Chatterjee The Buddhist text  describes Ashoka putting down a revolt due to activities of wicked ministers</span>
				<span class='text'>This may have been an incident in s times</span>
				<span class='text'>s account states that  Bindusaras chief advisor destroyed the nobles and kings of 16 towns and made himself the master of all territory between the eastern and the western seas</span>
				<span class='text'>Some historians consider this as an indication of Bindusaras conquest of the Deccan while others consider it as suppression of a revolt</span>
				<span class='text'>Following this Ashoka was stationed at Ujjayini as governor</span>
				<span class='text'>indusaras death in 272 BCE led to a war over succession</span>
				<span class='text'>According to the Divyavadana Bindusara wanted his son  to succeed him but Ashoka was supported by his fathers ministers who found Susima to be arrogant and disrespectful towards them</span>
				<span class='text'>name Swarup1999  A minister named Radhagupta seems to have played an important role in Ashokas rise to the throne</span>
				<span class='text'>The Ashokavadana recounts Radhaguptas offering of an old royal elephant to Ashoka for him to ride to the Garden of the Gold Pavilion where King Bindusara would determine his successor</span>
				<span class='text'>Ashoka later got rid of the legitimate heir to the throne by tricking him into entering a pit filled with live coals</span>
				<span class='text'>Radhagupta according to the Ashokavadana would later be appointed prime minister by Ashoka once he had gained the throne</span>

				<span class='text'>uddhist legends state that Ashoka was bad tempered and of a wicked nature</span>
				<span class='text'>He built  an elaborate  described as a Paradisal Hell due to the contrast between its beautiful exterior and the acts carried out within by his appointed executioner Girikaa</span>
				<span class='text'>name Pradip2002  This earned him the name of Chanda Ashoka  meaning Ashoka the Fierce in Sanskrit</span>
				<span class='text'>Professor Charles Drekmeier cautions that the Buddhist legends tend to dramatise the change that Buddhism brought in him and theore exaggerate Ashokas past wickedness and his piousness after the conversion</span>
				<span class='text'>name Charles1962 Ascending the throne Ashoka expanded his empire over the next eight years from the present day boundaries  in the East to  in the West from the  in Afghanistan in the north to the peninsula of southern India except for present day  and  which were ruled by the three   kingdoms</span>
				<span class='text'>Conquest of KalingaWhile the early part of Ashokas reign was apparently quite bloodthirsty he became a follower of the s teachings after his conquest of  on the east coast of India in the present day states of  and North Coastal </span>
				<span class='text'>Kalinga was a state that prided itself on its sovereignty and democracy</span>

				<span class='text'>Rajdharma means the duty of the rulers which was intrinsically entwined with the concept of bravery and dharma</span>
				<span class='text'>The Kalinga War happened  eight years after his coronation</span>
				<span class='text'>From his 13th inscription we come to know that the battle was a massive one and caused the deaths of more than 100000 soldiers and many civilians who rose up in defence over 150000 were deported</span>
				<span class='text'>rachin bharater itihas by sunil chattopadhyay  When he was walking through the grounds of Kalinga after his conquest rejoicing in his victory he was moved by the number of bodies strewn there and the wails of the kith and kin of the dead</span>

				<span class='text'>blockquoteThe edict goes on to address the even greater degree of sorrow and regret resulting from Ashokas understanding that the friends and families of deceased would suffer greatly too</span>
				<span class='text'>Legend says that one day after the war was over Ashoka ventured out to roam the city and all he could see were burnt houses and scattered corpses</span>
				<span class='text'>This sight made him sick and he cried the famous monologue blockquoteWhat have I done If this is a victory whats a defeat then Is this a victory or a defeat  Is this justice or injustice Is it gallantry or a rout Is it valor to kill innocent children and women Did I do it to widen the empire and for prosperity or to destroy the others kingdom and splendor  One has lost her husband someone else a father someone a child someone an unborn infant</span>

				<span class='text'> Whats this debris of the corpses Are these marks of victory or defeat Are these vultures crows eagles the messengers of death or evil blockquoteThe lethal war with Kalinga transformed the vengeful Emperor Ashoka to a stable and peaceful emperor and he became a patron of Buddhism</span>
				<span class='text'>Whether or not he converted to Buddhism is unclear   although Buddhist tradition mentions so</span>
				<span class='text'>According to the prominent   Ashokas personal religion became Buddhism if not before then certainly after the Kalinga war</span>
				<span class='text'>However according to Basham the Dharma officially propagated by Ashoka was not Buddhism at all</span>
				<span class='text'>he Wonder That was India  A</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Basham page 56   notes that modern day historians question his conversion into Buddhism in the aftermath of the Kalinga war</span>
				<span class='text'>She argues that Ashoka curiously rained from engraving his confession anywhere</span>
				<span class='text'>he Penguin History of Early India  Romila Thapar page 180 Nevertheless his patronage led to the expansion of Buddhism in the Mauryan empire and other kingdoms during his rule and worldwide from about 250 BCE</span>
				<span class='text'> Prominent in this cause were his son  Mahendra and daughter  whose name means friend of the Sangha who established Buddhism in Ceylon now Sri Lanka</span>
				<span class='text'>Archaeological evidence for Buddhism between the death of the Buddha and the time of Ashoka is scarce after the time of Ashoka it is abundant</span>
				<span class='text'>shoka ruled for an estimated forty years</span>
				<span class='text'>Legend states that during his cremation his body burned for seven days and nights</span>
				<span class='text'> After his death the Mauryan dynasty lasted just fifty more years until his empire stretched over almost all of the Indian subcontinent</span>
				<span class='text'>Ashoka had many wives and children but many of their names are lost to time</span>
				<span class='text'>His chief consort agramahisi for the majority of his reign was his wife  who apparently bore him no children</span>
				<span class='text'>name Mookerji66 In his old age he seems to have come under the spell of his youngest wife </span>
				<span class='text'>It is said that she had got Ashokas son  the regent in  and the heir presumptive to the throne blinded by a wily </span>
				<span class='text'>The official executioners spared Kunala and he became a wandering singer accompanied by his favourite wife </span>
				<span class='text'>In  Ashoka heard Kunalas song and realised that Kunalas misfortune may have been a punishment for some past sin of the emperor himself</span>
				<span class='text'>He condemned Tishyaraksha to death restoring Kunala to the court</span>
				<span class='text'>In the Ashokavadana Kunala is portrayed as forgiving Tishyaraksha having obtained enlightenment through Buddhist practice</span>
				<span class='text'>While he urges Ashoka to forgive her as well Ashoka does not respond with the same forgiveness</span>
				<span class='text'>name Pradip2002  Kunala was succeeded by his son  who ruled for 50 years until his death</span>
				<span class='text'>he reign of Ashoka Maurya might have disappeared into history as the ages passed by had he not left behind records of his reign</span>
				<span class='text'>These records are in the form of sculpted pillars and rocks inscribed with a variety of actions and teachings he wished to be published under his name</span>
				<span class='text'>The language used for inscription was in one of the  common languages etched in a Brahmi script</span>
				<span class='text'>n the year 185 BCE about fifty years after Ashokas death the last Maurya ruler  was assassinated by the commander in chief of the Mauryan armed forces  while he was taking the Guard of Honor of his forces</span>

				<span class='text'>ing Ashoka the third monarch of the Indian Mauryan dynasty is also considered as one of the most exemplary rulers who ever lived</span>
				<span class='text'>  One of the more enduring legacies of Ashoka Maurya was the model that he provided for the relationship between Buddhism and the state</span>
				<span class='text'>Throughout Theravada Southeastern Asia the model of rulership embodied by Ashoka replaced the notion of divine kingship that had previously dominated in the  kingdom for instance</span>
				<span class='text'>Under this model of Buddhist kingship the king sought to legitimise his rule not through descent from a divine source but by supporting and earning the approval of the Buddhist </span>
				<span class='text'>Following Ashokas example kings established monasteries funded the construction of stupas and supported the ordination of monks in their kingdom</span>
				<span class='text'>Many rulers also took an active role in resolving disputes over the status and regulation of the sangha as Ashoka had in calling a conclave to settle a number of contentious issues during his reign</span>
				<span class='text'>This development ultimately led to a close association in many Southeast Asian countries between the monarchy and the religious hierarchy an association that can still be seen today in the state supported  and the traditional role of the Thai king as both a religious and secular leader</span>
				<span class='text'>Ashoka also said that all his courtiers always governed the people in a moral manner</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to the legends mentioned in the 2nd century CE text  Ashoka was not non violent after adopting Buddhism</span>
				<span class='text'>In one instance a non Buddhist in  drew a picture showing the Buddha bowing at the feet of  identified with  24th Tirthankara of </span>
				<span class='text'>On complaint from a Buddhist devotee Ashoka issued an order to arrest him and subsequently another order to kill all the s in Pundravardhana</span>
				<span class='text'>Around 18000 followers of the Ajivika sect were executed as a result of this order</span>
				<span class='text'>name John1989  name Beni2010  Sometime later another Nirgrantha follower in  drew a similar picture</span>
				<span class='text'>Ashoka burnt him and his entire family alive in their house</span>
				<span class='text'>name Beni2010  He also announced an award of one  silver coin to anyone who brought him the head of a Nirgrantha heretic</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Ashokavadana as a result of this order his own brother was mistaken for a heretic and killed by a cowherd</span>
				<span class='text'>name John1989  These stories of persecutions of rival sects by Ashoka appear to be a clear fabrication arising out of sectarian propaganda</span>
				<span class='text'>name Steven2010  name LePhuoc2010 Historical sourcesAshoka was almost forgotten by the historians of the early British India but  contributed in the revelation of historical sources</span>
				<span class='text'>Another important historian was British   who was director General of the </span>
				<span class='text'>His main interests were  and  in addition to  and </span>
				<span class='text'>Sir  a British archaeologist and army engineer and often known as the father of the  unveiled heritage sites like the  Stupa Sarnath Sanchi and the Mahabodhi Temple</span>
				<span class='text'> a British archaeologist also exposed Ashokan historical sources especially the </span>
				<span class='text'>nformation about the life and reign of Ashoka primarily comes from a relatively small number of Buddhist sources</span>
				<span class='text'>In particular the   Story of Ashoka written in the 2nd century and the two  chronicles of Sri Lanka the  and  provide most of the currently known information about Ashoka</span>
				<span class='text'>Additional information is contributed by the  whose authorship was finally attributed to the Ashoka of Buddhist legend after the discovery of dynastic lists that gave the name used in the edicts Priyadarshi—He who regards everyone with affection as a title or additional name of Ashoka Maurya</span>
				<span class='text'>Architectural remains of his period have been found at   which include an 80 pillar  hall</span>
				<span class='text'> The Edicts of Ashoka are a collection of 33 inscriptions on the  as well as boulders and cave walls made by Ashoka during his reign</span>
				<span class='text'>These inscriptions are dispersed throughout modern day Pakistan and India and represent the first tangible evidence of Buddhism</span>
				<span class='text'>The edicts describe in detail the first wide expansion of Buddhism through the sponsorship of one of the most powerful kings of Indian history offering more information about  Ashokas proselytism moral precepts religious precepts and his notions of social and animal welfare</span>
				<span class='text'>name Singh2012 ampnbsp– The Ashokavadana is a 2nd century CE text related to the legend of Ashoka</span>
				<span class='text'>The legend was translated into Chinese by  in 300 CE</span>
				<span class='text'>It is essentially a Hinayana text and its world is that of Mathura and North west India</span>
				<span class='text'>The emphasis of this little known text is on exploring the relationship between the king and the community of monks the  and setting up an ideal of religious life for the  the common man by telling appealing stories about religious exploits</span>
				<span class='text'>The most startling feature is that Ashoka’s conversion has nothing to do with the Kalinga war which is not even mentioned nor is there a word about his belonging to the Maurya dynasty</span>
				<span class='text'>Equally surprising is the record of his use of state power to spread Buddhism in an uncompromising fashion</span>
				<span class='text'>The legend of Veetashoka provides insights into Ashoka’s character that are not available in the widely known Pali records</span>
				<span class='text'>name Pradip2002   The Mahavamsa Great Chronicle is a historical poem written in the  language of the kings of Sri Lanka</span>
				<span class='text'>It covers the period from the coming of King Vijaya of  ancient Odisha in 543 BCE to the reign of King Mahasena 334–361</span>
				<span class='text'>As it often ers to the royal dynasties of India the Mahavamsa is also valuable for historians who wish to date and relate contemporary royal dynasties in the </span>
				<span class='text'>It is very important in dating the consecration of Ashoka</span>
				<span class='text'> The Dwipavamsa or Dweepavamsa i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Chronicle of the Island in Pali is the oldest historical record of Sri Lanka</span>
				<span class='text'>The chronicle is believed to be compiled from  and other sources around the 3rd or 4th century CE</span>
				<span class='text'>King Dhatusena 4th century had ordered that the Dipavamsa be recited at the  festival held annually in Anuradhapura</span>
				<span class='text'>erceptionsThe use of Buddhist sources in reconstructing the life of Ashoka has had a strong influence on perceptions of Ashoka as well as the interpretations of his Edicts</span>
				<span class='text'>Building on traditional accounts early scholars regarded Ashoka as a primarily Buddhist monarch who underwent a conversion to Buddhism and was actively engaged in sponsoring and supporting the Buddhist monastic institution</span>
				<span class='text'>Some scholars have tended to question this assessment</span>
				<span class='text'>The only source of information not attributable to Buddhist sources are the Ashokan Edicts and these do not explicitly state that Ashoka was a Buddhist</span>
				<span class='text'>In his edicts Ashoka expresses support for all the major religions of his time    and ism and his edicts addressed to the population at large there are some addressed specifically to Buddhists this is not the case for the other religions generally focus on moral themes members of all the religions would accept</span>
				<span class='text'>owever there is strong evidence in the edicts alone that he was a Buddhist</span>
				<span class='text'>In one edict he belittles rituals and he banned Vedic animal sacrifices these strongly suggest that he at least did not look to the Vedic tradition for guidance</span>
				<span class='text'>Furthermore there are many edicts expressed to Buddhists alone in one Ashoka declares himself to be an  and in another he demonstrates a close familiarity with Buddhist texts</span>
				<span class='text'>He erected rock pillars at Buddhist holy sites but did not do so for the sites of other religions</span>
				<span class='text'>He also used the word  to er to qualities of the heart that underlie moral action this was an exclusively Buddhist use of the word</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally the ideals he promotes correspond to the first three steps of the Buddhas graduated discourse</span>
				<span class='text'>ichard Robinson Willard Johnson and Thanissaro Bhikkhu Buddhist Religions fifth ed</span>
				<span class='text'>Wadsworth 2005 page 59</span>
				<span class='text'>Interestingly the Ashokavadana presents an alternate view of the familiar Ashoka one in which his conversion does not have anything to do with the Kalinga war or about his descent from the Maurya dynasty</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead Ashokas reason for adopting non violence appears much more personal</span>
				<span class='text'>The Ashokavadana shows that the main source of Ashokas conversion and the acts of welfare that followed are rooted instead in intense personal anguish at its core from a wellspring inside himself not so much necessarily spurred by a specific event</span>
				<span class='text'>It thereby illuminates Ashoka as more humanly ambitious and passionate with both greatness and flaws</span>
				<span class='text'>This Ashoka is very different from the shadowy do gooder of later Pali chronicles</span>
				<span class='text'>name Pradip2002 Much of the knowledge about Ashoka comes from the  that he had carved on pillars and rocks throughout the empire</span>
				<span class='text'>All his inscriptions present him as compassionate  and loving</span>
				<span class='text'>In the Kalinga rock edits he addresses his people as his children and mentions that as a father he desires their good</span>
				<span class='text'>name VenSDhammika 1993  These inscriptions promoted Buddhist morality and encouraged nonviolence and adherence to  duty or proper behaviour and they talk of his fame and conquered lands as well as the neighbouring kingdoms holding up his might</span>
				<span class='text'>One also gets some primary information about the Kalinga War and Ashokas allies plus some useful knowledge on the civil administration</span>
				<span class='text'>The Ashoka Pillar at  is the most notable of the relics left by Ashoka</span>
				<span class='text'>Made of sandstone this pillar records the visit of the emperor to Sarnath in the 3rd century BCE</span>
				<span class='text'>It has a four lion capital four lions standing back to back which was adopted as the emblem of the modern Indian republic</span>
				<span class='text'>The lion symbolises both Ashokas imperial rule and the kingship of the </span>
				<span class='text'>In translating these monuments historians learn the bulk of what is assumed to have been true fact of the Mauryan Empire</span>
				<span class='text'>It is difficult to determine whether or not some actual events ever happened but the stone etchings clearly depict how Ashoka wanted to be thought of and remembered</span>
				<span class='text'>ecently scholarly analysis  determined that the three major foci of debate regarding Ashoka involve the nature of the Maurya empire the extent and impact of Ashokas pacifism and what is erred to in the Inscriptions as dhamma or  which connotes goodness virtue and charity</span>
				<span class='text'>Some historians have argued that Ashokas pacifism undermined the military backbone of the Maurya empire while others have suggested that the extent and impact of his pacifism have been grossly exaggerated</span>
				<span class='text'>The dhamma of the Edicts has been understood as concurrently a Buddhist lay ethic a set of politico moral ideas a sort of universal religion or as an Ashokan innovation</span>
				<span class='text'>On the other hand it has also been interpreted as an essentially political ideology that sought to knit together a vast and diverse empire</span>
				<span class='text'>Scholars are still attempting to analyse both the expressed and implied political ideas of the Edicts particularly in regard to imperial vision and make inferences pertaining to how that vision was grappling with problems and political realities of a virtually subcontinental and culturally and economically highly variegated 3rd century BCE Indian empire</span>
				<span class='text'>Nonetheless it remains clear that Ashokas Inscriptions represent the earliest corpus of royal inscriptions in the Indian subcontinent and theore prove to be a very important innovation in royal practices</span>
				<span class='text'>ContributionsAccording to Indian historian Romila Thapar Ashoka emphasized respect for all religious teachers harmonious relationship between parents and children teachers and pupils and employers and employees</span>
				<span class='text'>icrosoft Encarta Article on Ashoka  Ashokas religion contained gleanings from all religions</span>

				<span class='text'>t is well known that Ashoka sent dütas or emissaries to convey messages or letters written or oral rather both to various people</span>
				<span class='text'>The VIth Rock Edict about oral orders reveals this</span>
				<span class='text'>It was later confirmed that it was not unusual to add oral messages to written ones and the content of Ashokas messages can be inferred likewise from the XIIIth Rock Edict They were meant to spread his dhammavijaya which he considered the highest victory and which he wished to propagate everywhere including far beyond India</span>
