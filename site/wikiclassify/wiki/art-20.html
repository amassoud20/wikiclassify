				<span class='text'>Pushyamitra Shunga founded the [[Shunga dynasty]] (185-75 BCE) and ruled just a fragmented part of the Mauryan Empire</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of the northwestern territories of the Mauryan Empire (modern-day Afghanistan and Northern Pakistan) became the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Throughout Theravada Southeastern Asia, the model of rulership embodied by Ashoka replaced the notion of divine kingship that had previously dominated (in the [[Angkor]] kingdom, for instance)</span>
				<span class='text'>Under this model of 'Buddhist kingship', the king sought to legitimise his rule not through descent from a divine source, but by supporting and earning the approval of the Buddhist ''[[sangha]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Following Ashoka's example, kings established monasteries, funded the construction of stupas, and supported the ordination of monks in their kingdom</span>
				<span class='text'>Many rulers also took an active role in resolving disputes over the status and regulation of the sangha, as Ashoka had in calling a conclave to settle a number of contentious issues during his reign</span>
				<span class='text'>This development ultimately led to a close association in many Southeast Asian countries between the monarchy and the religious hierarchy, an association that can still be seen today in the state-supported [[Buddhism in Thailand|Buddhism of Thailand]] and the traditional role of the Thai king as both a religious and secular leader</span>
				<span class='text'>Ashoka also said that all his courtiers always governed the people in a moral manner</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to the legends mentioned in the 2nd-century CE text ''[[Ashokavadana]]'', Ashoka was not non-violent after adopting Buddhism</span>
				<span class='text'>In one instance, a non-Buddhist in [[Pundravardhana]] drew a picture showing the Buddha bowing at the feet of [[Nirgrantha Jnatiputra]] (identified with [[Mahavira]], 24th Tirthankara of [[Jainism]])</span>
				<span class='text'>On complaint from a Buddhist devotee, Ashoka issued an order to arrest him, and subsequently, another order to kill all the [[Ajivika]]s in Pundravardhana</span>
				<span class='text'>Around 18,000 followers of the Ajivika sect were executed as a result of this order</span>

				<span class='text'>In particular, the [[Sanskrit]] ''[[Ashokavadana]]'' ('Story of Ashoka'), written in the 2nd century, and the two [[Pāli]] chronicles of Sri Lanka (the [[Dipavamsa]] and [[Mahavamsa]]) provide most of the currently known information about Ashoka</span>
				<span class='text'>Additional information is contributed by the [[Edicts of Ashoka]], whose authorship was finally attributed to the Ashoka of Buddhist legend after the discovery of dynastic lists that gave the name used in the edicts (''Priyadarshi''—'He who regards everyone with affection') as a title or additional name of Ashoka Maurya</span>

				<span class='text'>These inscriptions are dispersed throughout modern-day Pakistan and India, and represent the first tangible evidence of Buddhism</span>
				<span class='text'>The edicts describe in detail the first wide expansion of Buddhism through the sponsorship of one of the most powerful kings of Indian history, offering more information about  Ashoka's proselytism, moral precepts, religious precepts, and his notions of social and animal welfare</span>

				<span class='text'>It is essentially a Hinayana text, and its world is that of Mathura and North-west India</span>
				<span class='text'>The emphasis of this little known text is on exploring the relationship between the king and the community of monks (the [[Sangha]]) and setting up an ideal of religious life for the [[laity]] (the common man) by telling appealing stories about religious exploits</span>
				<span class='text'>The most startling feature is that Ashoka’s conversion has nothing to do with the Kalinga war, which is not even mentioned, nor is there a word about his belonging to the Maurya dynasty</span>
				<span class='text'>Equally surprising is the record of his use of state power to spread Buddhism in an uncompromising fashion</span>

				<span class='text'>It covers the period from the coming of King Vijaya of [[Kalinga (India)|Kalinga]] (ancient Odisha) in 543 BCE to the reign of King Mahasena (334–361)</span>
				<span class='text'>As it often refers to the royal dynasties of India, the Mahavamsa is also valuable for historians who wish to date and relate contemporary royal dynasties in the [[Indian subcontinent]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It is very important in dating the consecration of Ashoka</span>
				<span class='text'>[Dwipavamsa]] -The Dwipavamsa, or &quot;Dweepavamsa&quot;, (i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> Chronicle of the Island, in Pali) is the oldest historical record of Sri Lanka</span>
				<span class='text'>The chronicle is believed to be compiled from [[Atthakatha]] and other sources around the 3rd or 4th century CE</span>
				<span class='text'>King Dhatusena (4th century) had ordered that the Dipavamsa be recited at the [[Mahinda (buddhist monk)|Mahinda]] festival held annually in Anuradhapura</span>
				<span class='text'>=Perceptions==The use of Buddhist sources in reconstructing the life of Ashoka has had a strong influence on perceptions of Ashoka, as well as the interpretations of his Edicts</span>
				<span class='text'>Building on traditional accounts, early scholars regarded Ashoka as a primarily Buddhist monarch who underwent a conversion to Buddhism and was actively engaged in sponsoring and supporting the Buddhist monastic institution</span>
				<span class='text'>Some scholars have tended to question this assessment</span>
				<span class='text'>The only source of information not attributable to Buddhist sources are the Ashokan Edicts, and these do not explicitly state that Ashoka was a Buddhist</span>
				<span class='text'>In his edicts, Ashoka expresses support for all the major religions of his time: [[Buddhism]], [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmanism]], [[Jainism]], and [[Ajivika]]ism, and his edicts addressed to the population at large (there are some addressed specifically to Buddhists; this is not the case for the other religions) generally focus on moral themes members of all the religions would accept</span>
				<span class='text'>owever, there is strong evidence in the edicts alone that he was a Buddhist</span>
				<span class='text'>In one edict he belittles rituals, and he banned Vedic animal sacrifices; these strongly suggest that he at least did not look to the Vedic tradition for guidance</span>
				<span class='text'>Furthermore, there are many edicts expressed to Buddhists alone; in one, Ashoka declares himself to be an &quot;[[upasaka]]&quot;, and in another he demonstrates a close familiarity with Buddhist texts</span>
				<span class='text'>He erected rock pillars at Buddhist holy sites, but did not do so for the sites of other religions</span>
				<span class='text'>He also used the word [[Dharma (Buddhism)|&quot;dhamma&quot;]] to refer to qualities of the heart that underlie moral action; this was an exclusively Buddhist use of the word</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally, the ideals he promotes correspond to the first three steps of the Buddha's graduated discourse</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Richard Robinson, Willard Johnson, and Thanissaro Bhikkhu, ''Buddhist Religions'', fifth ed</span>
				<span class='text'> Wadsworth 2005, page 59</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Interestingly, the Ashokavadana presents an alternate view of the familiar Ashoka; one in which his conversion does not have anything to do with the Kalinga war or about his descent from the Maurya dynasty</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, Ashoka's reason for adopting non-violence appears much more personal</span>
				<span class='text'>The Ashokavadana shows that the main source of Ashoka's conversion and the acts of welfare that followed are rooted instead in intense personal anguish at its core, from a wellspring inside himself (not so much necessarily spurred by a specific event)</span>
				<span class='text'>It thereby illuminates Ashoka as more humanly ambitious and passionate, with both greatness and flaws</span>
				<span class='text'>''This'' Ashoka is very different from the &quot;shadowy do-gooder&quot; of later Pali chronicles</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pradip2002&quot;/&gt;Much of the knowledge about Ashoka comes from the [[Edicts of Ashoka|several inscriptions]] that he had carved on pillars and rocks throughout the empire</span>
				<span class='text'>All his inscriptions present him as compassionate  and loving</span>
				<span class='text'>In the Kalinga rock edits, he addresses his people as his &quot;children&quot; and mentions that as a father he desires their good</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;VenSDhammika_1993&quot;/&gt; These inscriptions promoted Buddhist morality and encouraged nonviolence and adherence to [[dharma]] (duty or proper behaviour), and they talk of his fame and conquered lands as well as the neighbouring kingdoms holding up his might</span>
				<span class='text'>One also gets some primary information about the Kalinga War and Ashoka's allies plus some useful knowledge on the civil administration</span>
				<span class='text'>The Ashoka Pillar at [[Sarnath]] is the most notable of the relics left by Ashoka</span>
				<span class='text'>Made of sandstone, this pillar records the visit of the emperor to Sarnath, in the 3rd century BCE</span>
				<span class='text'>It has a four-lion capital (four lions standing back to back) which was adopted as the emblem of the modern Indian republic</span>
				<span class='text'>The lion symbolises both Ashoka's imperial rule and the kingship of the [[Buddha]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In translating these monuments, historians learn the bulk of what is assumed to have been true fact of the Mauryan Empire</span>
				<span class='text'>It is difficult to determine whether or not some actual events ever happened, but the stone etchings clearly depict how Ashoka wanted to be thought of and remembered</span>
				<span class='text'>==Focus of debate===Recently scholarly analysis  determined that the three major foci of debate regarding Ashoka involve the nature of the Maurya empire; the extent and impact of Ashoka's pacifism, and what is referred to in the Inscriptions as ''dhamma'' or [[dharma]], which connotes goodness, virtue, and charity</span>
				<span class='text'>Some historians{{Who|date=February 2013}} have argued that Ashoka's pacifism undermined the &quot;military backbone&quot; of the Maurya empire, while others have suggested that the extent and impact of his pacifism have been &quot;grossly exaggerated&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''dhamma'' of the Edicts has been understood as concurrently a Buddhist lay ethic, a set of politico-moral ideas, a &quot;sort of universal religion&quot;, or as an Ashokan innovation</span>
				<span class='text'>On the other hand, it has also been interpreted as an ''essentially political'' ideology that sought to knit together a vast and diverse empire</span>
				<span class='text'>Scholars are still attempting to analyse both the expressed and implied political ideas of the Edicts (particularly in regard to imperial vision), and make inferences pertaining to how that vision was grappling with problems and political realities of a &quot;virtually subcontinental, and culturally and economically highly variegated, 3rd century BCE Indian empire</span>
				<span class='text'>Nonetheless, it remains clear that Ashoka's Inscriptions represent the earliest corpus of royal inscriptions in the Indian subcontinent, and therefore prove to be a very important innovation in royal practices</span>

				<span class='text'>He sent his only daughter [[Sanghamitra]] and son [[Mahinda (buddhist monk)|Mahindra]] to spread Buddhism in Sri Lanka (then known as Tamraparni)</span>
				<span class='text'>Ashoka also sent many prominent Buddhist monks (bhikshus) Sthaviras like Madhyamik Sthavira to modern [[Kashmir]] and Afghanistan; Maharaskshit Sthavira to Syria, [[Persia]] / Iran, Egypt, Greece, Italy and Turkey; Massim Sthavira to Nepal, Bhutan, China and Mongolia; Sohn Uttar Sthavira to modern Cambodia, Laos, Burma (old name Suvarnabhumi for Burma and Thailand), Thailand and Vietnam; Mahadhhamarakhhita stahvira to [[Maharashtra]] (old name Maharatthha); Maharakhhit Sthavira and Yavandhammarakhhita Sthavira to [[South India]]</span>

				<span class='text'>The VIth Rock Edict about &quot;oral orders&quot; reveals this</span>
				<span class='text'>It was later confirmed that it was not unusual to add oral messages to written ones, and the content of Ashoka's messages can be inferred likewise from the XIIIth Rock Edict: They were meant to spread his ''dhammavijaya,'' which he considered the highest victory and which he wished to propagate everywhere (including far beyond India)</span>
				<span class='text'>There is obvious and undeniable trace of cultural contact through the adoption of the Kharosthi script, and the idea of installing inscriptions might have travelled with this script, as [[Achaemenid]] influence is seen in some of the formulations used by Ashoka in his inscriptions</span>

				<span class='text'>The wheel has 24 spokes which represent the 12 Laws of Dependent Origination and the 12 Laws of Dependent Termination</span>
				<span class='text'>The Ashoka Chakra has been widely inscribed on many relics of the [[Mauryan]] Emperor, most prominent among which is the Lion Capital of [[Sarnath]] and The [[Ashoka Pillar]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The most visible use of the Ashoka Chakra today is at the centre of the National flag of the Republic of India (adopted on 22 July 1947), where it is rendered in a Navy-blue color on a White background, by replacing the symbol of Charkha ([[Spinning wheel]]) of the pre-independence versions of the flag</span>

				<span class='text'>[[Chakra]] is a [[Sanskrit]] word which also means &quot;cycle&quot; or &quot;self-repeating process&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Originally, there must have been many pillars of Ashoka although only ten with inscriptions still survive</span>
				<span class='text'>Averaging between forty and fifty feet in height, and weighing up to fifty tons each, all the pillars were quarried at Chunar, just south of Varanasi and dragged, sometimes hundreds of miles, to where they were erected</span>
				<span class='text'>The first Pillar of Ashoka was found in the 16th century by Thomas Coryat in the ruins of ancient Delhi</span>
				<span class='text'>The wheel represents the sun time and Buddhist law, while the [[swastika]] stands for the cosmic dance around a fixed center and guards against evil</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|This is the famous original sandstone sculpted [[Lion Capital of Ashoka]] preserved at [[Sarnath Museum]] which was originally erected around 250 BCE atop an [[Ashoka Pillar]] at [[Sarnath]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The angle from which this picture has been taken, minus the [[inverted bell]]-shaped [[Indian lotus|lotus]] flower, has been adopted as the [[National Emblem of India]] showing the Horse on the left and the Bull on the right of the [[Ashoka Chakra]] in the circular base on which the four [[Indian lion]]s are standing back to back</span>

				<span class='text'>] --&gt;The Lion capital of Ashoka is a sculpture of four lions standing back to back</span>
				<span class='text'>It was originally placed atop the Ashoka pillar at [[Sarnath]], now in the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]], India</span>
				<span class='text'>The pillar, sometimes called the Ashoka Column is still in its original location, but the Lion Capital is now in the [[Sarnath Museum]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This Lion Capital of Ashoka from Sarnath has been adopted as the National Emblem of India and the wheel &quot;[[Ashoka Chakra]]&quot; from its base was placed onto the center of the [[National Flag of India]]</span>
				<span class='text'>he capital contains four lions (Indian / Asiatic Lions), standing back to back, mounted on an abacus, with a frieze carrying sculptures in high relief of an elephant, a galloping horse, a bull, and a lion, separated by intervening spoked chariot-wheels over a bell-shaped lotus</span>
				<span class='text'>Carved out of a single block of polished sandstone, the capital was believed to be crowned by a 'Wheel of Dharma' (Dharmachakra popularly known in India as the &quot;Ashoka Chakra&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>he Ashoka Lion capital or the Sarnath lion capital is also known as the national symbol of India</span>
				<span class='text'>The Sarnath pillar bears one of the Edicts of Ashoka, an inscription against division within the Buddhist community, which reads, &quot;No one shall cause division in the order of monks</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The Sarnath pillar is a column surmounted by a capital, which consists of a canopy representing an inverted bell-shaped lotus flower, a short cylindrical abacus with four 24-spoked Dharma wheels with four animals (an elephant, a bull, a horse, a lion)</span>
				<span class='text'>he four animals in the Sarnath capital are believed to symbolise different steps of Lord [[Buddha]]'s life</span>
				<span class='text'> The Elephant represents the Buddha's idea in reference to the dream of Queen Maya of a white elephant entering her womb</span>
				<span class='text'> The Bull represents desire during the life of the Buddha as a prince</span>
				<span class='text'> The Horse represents Buddha's departure from palatial life</span>
				<span class='text'> The Lion represents the accomplishment of Buddha</span>
				<span class='text'>esides the religious interpretations, there are some non-religious interpretations also about the symbolism of the Ashoka capital pillar at Sarnath</span>
				<span class='text'>According to them, the four lions symbolise Ashoka's rule over the four directions, the wheels as symbols of his enlightened rule (Chakravartin) and the four animals as symbols of four adjoining territories of India</span>
