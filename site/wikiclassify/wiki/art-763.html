				<span class='text'>His TV movie music albums were not soundtrack albums but are titled &quot;Music from </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot; or &quot;Music from the Motion Picture </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He routinely retained the rights to his music</span>
				<span class='text'>Mancini's contracts allowed him to release his own albums for which he rearranged the score music into arrangements more appropriate for listening outside of the context of the film/theater</span>
				<span class='text'> Actual film scores using players from Hollywood unions recording under major motion picture studio contracts were expensive to release  on LP (ex: the soundtrack for 'Our Man Flint' (not a Mancini score) cost $1 more than other LP albums of the day)</span>
				<span class='text'> Many soundtrack albums used to claim &quot;Original Soundtrack&quot; or words to that effect, but were not necessarily the actual soundtrack recordings</span>
				<span class='text'>These albums were usually recorded with a smaller orchestra than that used for the actual scoring (ex: Dimitri Tiomkin's score to 'The Alamo')</span>
				<span class='text'>However, many Hollywood musicians were featured on Mancini's albums recorded in RCA's Hollywood recording studios and faux &quot;Original Soundtrack&quot; albums </span>
				<span class='text'>ventually some of his scores and faux &quot;Original Soundtrack&quot; scores by numerous composers were released in limited edition CDs</span>
