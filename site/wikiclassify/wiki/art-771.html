				<span class='text'>In 1617 the Polish–Swedish conflict, which had been interrupted by an armistice in 1611, broke out again</span>
				<span class='text'>While Sigismund's army was also fighting [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces in Moldavia (1617–21), King [[Gustavus II Adolphus]] of Sweden (Charles IX's son) invaded Sigismund's lands, capturing [[Riga]] (1621) and seizing almost all of Polish [[Livonia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Sigismund, who concluded the [[Truce of Altmark]] with Sweden in 1629, never regained the Swedish crown</span>
				<span class='text'>His Swedish wars resulted, moreover, in Poland's loss of Livonia and in a diminution of the kingdom's international prestige</span>

				<span class='text'>His long reign coincided with [[Polish Golden Age|the apex of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth's prestige, power and economic influence]]</span>
				<span class='text'>On the other hand, it was during his reign that the symptoms of decline leading to the Commonwealth's eventual demise surfaced</span>
				<span class='text'>Popular histories, such as the books of [[Paweł Jasienica]], tend to present Sigismund as the principal source of these destructive processes; whereas academic histories are usually not as damning of him</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the question of whether the Commonwealth's decline was caused by Sigismund's decisions or had its roots in historical processes beyond his personal control, remains a highly debated topic</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|150px|Sigismund in his youth]]Sigismund was born on 20 June 1566 to [[Catherine Jagiellon]] of Poland and King [[John III of Sweden]] at [[Gripsholm]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His parents, at the time, were being held prisoner by King [[Eric XIV]], but despite the Protestant domination of Sweden young Sigismund was raised as a [[Roman Catholic]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Regaining the throne of Sweden would be one of the primary driving forces in his life</span>
				<span class='text'>His [[Poland|Polish]] connection came through his mother who was the daughter of [[Sigismund I the Old]] and the [[Jagiellonian]] family had been the royal family of the [[Kingdom of Poland]] and the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] since King [[Władysław II Jagiełło]] (Jogaila) obtained the crown in 1386 through his [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin]] wife, Saint Queen [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1587 Sigismund stood for election to the Polish throne after the death of King [[Stephen Bathory]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was supported by Chancellor and [[Hetman]] [[Jan Zamoyski]], the dowager [[Anna Jagiellon|Queen Anna]] and the nobles loyal to the [[Zborowski family]]</span>
				<span class='text'>With this network behind him he was duly elected King of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth on 19 August 1587 with the blessings of the primate of Poland [[Stanisław Karnkowski]]</span>
				<span class='text'>From that time his official name and title became Sigismund III, by the grace of God, king of Poland, grand duke of [[Lithuania]], [[Ruthenia]], [[Prussia]], [[Masovia]], Samogitia, [[Livonia]] and also hereditary king of the Swedes, Goths and Wends; the later titles being in reference to the claims of his father to the Swedish throne</span>
				<span class='text'>==Opposition to the throne===However, as was often the case with the Polish electoral monarchy, the outcome was strongly contested by the &quot;losers&quot; and the greedy and stubborn Polish nobility who backed the Archduke [[Maximilian III, Archduke of Austria|Maximilian III of Further Austria]] for King of Poland</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon hearing of his election King Sigismund slipped through the clutches of the [[Protestants]] in Sweden and landed in Poland on 7 October and immediately agreed to give up several royal privileges to the parliament ([[Sejm]]) of the Commonwealth in the hope of winning over some of his enemies and settling the disputed election</span>
				<span class='text'>He was proclaimed by the Lesser [[Royal Prussia|Prussian]] Treasurer {{ill|pl|Jan Dulski}} as king on behalf of the Crown Marshal [[Andrzej Opaliński (1540–1593)|Andrzej Opaliński]] and after arriving in the Royal Capital City of [[Kraków]] he was crowned on 27 December inside the [[Wawel Cathedral]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It seemed that the issue of who would be King of Poland had been settled when Maximilian III invaded at the head of his army to claim his crown</span>
				<span class='text'>The hostilities did not last long as Hetman Jan Zamoyski at the head of a Polish army loyal to King Sigismund met and successfully defeated the Austrian troops at the [[Battle of Byczyna]] and took Maximilian III as prisoner of war</span>
				<span class='text'>However, at the request of [[Pope Sixtus V]], King Sigismund III released Maximilian who surrendered his claim to the Polish Commonwealth in 1589</span>
				<span class='text'>King Sigismund also tried to maintain peace with his powerful neighbor by marrying Archduchess [[Anne of Austria, Queen of Poland|Anna of Austria]] in 1592</span>
				<span class='text'>His was always his intention to be allied with [[Habsburg Austria|Catholic Austria]] against the Protestant forces that were tearing Christendom apart</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Bacciarelli - Zygmunt III</span>
				<span class='text'>peg|thumb|right|Portrait by [[Bacciarelli]]]]When his father died King Sigismund III requested from his parliament that he be allowed to claim his inheritance as the rightful [[King of Sweden]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Poles]] had no objection and when he promised to respect [[Lutheranism]] as the official religion of Sweden; the Swedes agreed to the proposition and Sigismund was crowned King of Sweden in 1594</span>
				<span class='text'>He appointed his uncle, [[Charles IX of Sweden|Duke Charles]], to rule as regent on his behalf in Sweden while he remained in Poland since the Swedes and the Commonwealth were not [[real union|united politically]] but simply had a [[personal union]] by sharing one monarch</span>
				<span class='text'>However, tensions grew quickly with Sweden as despite the legal guarantees, King Sigismund was a devout and ultra-Catholic person and this made the Swedes nervous and somewhat cynical</span>
				<span class='text'>The Lutheran firebrands warned that Sigismund had the ultimate goal of making Sweden Catholic again</span>
				<span class='text'>As proof they pointed to the [[Union of Brest]] set up in 1596 which brought many [[Eastern Orthodox]] into the Catholic fold and led to the modern day [[Ukrainian Catholic Church]], to his friendship with Catholic Austria and his support for the Catholic Reformation, particularly the [[Jesuit]] order, which was spreading out to refute Protestantism and regain lost spiritual ground for Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>==Internal and external affairs of the Commonwealth===Combating heresy and giving Poland a strong and stable government were the primary goals of King Sigismund</span>
				<span class='text'>Toward this end he moved the royal court from [[Kraków]] to [[Warsaw]] and oversaw the arrival of the Jesuits who established new schools throughout Poland and became chaplains and confessors to many families</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Religion in Poland|Catholic Church in Poland]] rebounded strongly during the early years of the reign of King Sigismund III</span>
				<span class='text'>Their preaching was very well received by the public and along with their staunch defense of the faith they also reminded Poles of their crucial role as the first line of defense for Catholic Christendom against the Orthodox Russians and the [[Turkish people|Ottoman Turks]]</span>
				<span class='text'>However, trouble was never far away for King Sigismund and 1598 was a particularly painful year</span>
				<span class='text'>His wife, Anna, suddenly died (he later married her sister [[Constance of Austria]] in 1605) and he experienced the outbreak of a [[War against Sigismund|rebellion in Sweden]] (known as ''War against Sigismund'') led by his own uncle and regent who portrayed himself as the Protestant champion of Sweden fighting against their Polish Catholic monarch</span>
				<span class='text'>King Sigismund moved against him which a combined the Swedish and [[Polish army|Polish forces]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He won some early victories but the climax came at the [[Battle of Stangebro]] in which his 8,000-strong army was defeated by the 12,000 men of Duke Charles</span>
				<span class='text'>The Swedish loyalists were executed by the Protestant government and after the King returned to Poland he was declared [[deposition (politics)|deposed]] and his uncle was proclaimed King [[Charles IX of Sweden]] in 1600</span>
				<span class='text'>A number of [[Swedish-Polish wars]] resulted but the personal union was never to be recovered despite the many persistent efforts of King Sigismund</span>

				<span class='text'>peg|thumb|right|''Tsar Vasiliy Shuyskiy brought before Sigismund in Warsaw'', painting by [[Matejko]]]]Trouble was also plentiful on the southern border where Poland was drawn into the wars of local nobles and the Austrian [[Habsburgs]] against the Muslim [[Tatars]] and Ottoman Turks</span>
				<span class='text'>King Sigismund was anxious to help Austria and was promised territorial gains for Poland in return for his assistance</span>
				<span class='text'>He sent in an army consisting of mercenaries from the wars in Russia to the Principality of [[Moldavia]], but in 1620 the Polish forces were defeated and Sigismund was forced to renounce his claim to the principality</span>
				<span class='text'>It was a setback but resulted in a negotiated peace and was no stunning victory for the Muslims who had vowed to destroy the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and in this aim they certainly failed</span>
				<span class='text'>Almost at the same time as these troubles, and those with Sweden, Sigismund was fighting a war with the Grand Duchy of Muscovy</span>
				<span class='text'>In the time of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth it was the Poles that were a force to be reckoned with, especially their elite [[Polish hussars|heavy, winged, hussars]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Russians had been fighting amongst themselves and King Sigismund got involved, as did Sweden though they were never firmly on one side or the other</span>
				<span class='text'>At one point the Russians invited the son of King Sigismund, [[Władysław IV Vasa|Prince Władysław]] to become their [[Tsar]], but Sigismund would not allow it</span>
				<span class='text'>He though he himself might become the master of Russia and though this did not happen the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth did win a number of victories and gained more territory</span>
				<span class='text'>At one point Polish troops, under the command of the great general [[Stanisław Żółkiewski]], even captured Moscow and the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>On the downside the whole conflict meant that any lasting union between the Commonwealth and Russia was impossible and any plans concerning the final destruction of the Russian state were unsuccessful</span>

				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|''Alchemist [[Sendivogius]] and Sigismund III'' by [[Jan Matejko]]]]Throughout these wars King Sigismund tried to [[:wikt:stabilize|stabilize]] and streamline the Commonwealth government</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[electoral monarchy]] in Poland had created a [[Szlachta|nobility]] with rather too extensive powers and a great deal of division</span>
				<span class='text'>Sigismund worked to gain more power for the king as well as to allow government business to pass with a majority of votes of the parliament rather than unanimity which was extremely hard to achieve and meant that things often did not get done</span>
				<span class='text'>All these actions led to a rebellion but the King was ultimately victorious and despite what his many detractors might say his reign marked a period of [[Polish Golden Age|Polish greatness]] the likes of which has not often been seen</span>
				<span class='text'>He made the Commonwealth very much the dominant power of Central and Eastern Europe and just as importantly ensured that Poland remained a solidly Catholic country in the face of Protestant incursions</span>
				<span class='text'>He was considered a brave man, a talented monarch and something of a [[Renaissance man]] as is evidenced by his devout faith and his artistic talent</span>
				<span class='text'>If the reforms he planned were successful and if he would create a personal union with Poland's neighbours, Sigismund might have been the father of a Catholic dynasty that stretched across Poland, Sweden, Finland, Lithuania, Moldavia, Turkey and Russia</span>
				<span class='text'>It did not happen, but that should not detract from his greatness as one of the royal champions of the [[Catholic Reformation]] period</span>
				<span class='text'>Sigismund was a gifted artist, painter and goldsmith; only one of his three paintings survived, one was for centuries erroneously attributed to [[Tintoretto]]; and from his own, personal workshop came the main part of the famous silver coffin of [[St</span>
				<span class='text'>Adalbert of Prague]] at the [[Gniezno Cathedral|Cathedral]] in [[Gniezno]]</span>

				<span class='text'>32&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Sigismund was deeply interested in [[alchemy]] and ancient methods of turning metals into [[gold]]; he often cooperated with the famous alchemist and philosopher [[Michael Sendivogius]] (Polish: ''Michał Sędziwój'')</span>
				<span class='text'>owards the end of his reign, Sigismund III withdrew altogether from politics and devoted himself exclusively to family matters and his interests in performing arts</span>
				<span class='text'>Shortly after the sudden death of his second wife, [[Constance of Austria]], Sigismund fell dangerously ill and experienced severe mental and psychological problems</span>
				<span class='text'>He died of a [[stroke]] on 30 April 1632 at the age of 65 in the [[Royal Castle, Warsaw|Royal Castle]] in [[Warsaw]] and was interred inside [[Wawel Cathedral]] in [[Kraków]]</span>

				<span class='text'>}Many historians believe that Sigismund viewed Poland only as a tool that would allow him to eventually regain the throne of Sweden</span>
				<span class='text'>To this end he tried to strengthen his royal power and allied himself with [[Habsburg]]s and [[Counter-Reformation]] forces</span>
				<span class='text'>His policies were opposed by many within the circles of the wealthy Polish nobility (the [[szlachta]]), most notably the chancellor [[Jan Zamoyski]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This led to a semi-legal rebellion against the king ([[rokosz]]), known as [[Zebrzydowski Rebellion]] (1606–08), which was a response to Sigismund's attempt to introduce [[majority voting]] in place of [[unanimity]] in the Sejm</span>
				<span class='text'>Eventually Sigismund's forces were victorious, but the rebels went unpunished</span>
				<span class='text'>Partially in order to pacify the restless szlachta, Sigismund supported war with [[Muscovy]] (the [[Polish–Muscovite War (1605–18)|Dimitriads]], 1608–18)</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Commonwealth forces were almost constantly shuffled between wars in the East (with Muscovy), north (with Sweden) and South (with Ottomans – the [[Moldavian Magnate Wars|Polish–Ottoman wars]]), Sigismund took advantage of the civil war in Russia (the [[Time of Troubles]]) and secured temporary territorial gains for the Commonwealth</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;http://encyclopedia2</span>
				<span class='text'>hefreedictionary</span>
				<span class='text'>om/Sigismund+III&lt;/ref&gt;While Sigismund never managed to regain the Swedish throne, his personal ambition to do so did succeed in provoking a [[List of wars involving Poland#Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|long series of conflicts]] between the Commonwealth and Sweden temporarily allied with [[Muscovy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>While the Commonwealth's [[Sejm|Royal Parliament]] managed to thwart many of the plans of Sigismund (and later of his son, Władysław), the Vasa dynasty nonetheless succeeded in partially drawing the Commonwealth into the [[Thirty Years' War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The conflict with Sweden, combined with wars against Ottomans and Muscovy, culminated well after Sigismund's death in the series of events known as the [[Deluge (history)|Swedish Deluge]], which ended the Golden Age of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth that spanned almost a century</span>
				<span class='text'>uring his reign Sigismund permitted the [[Brandenburg-Prussia|Brandenburg]] [[Hohenzollern]]s to inherit [[Duchy of Prussia|Ducal Prussia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This decision later greatly strengthened the Duchy and following the Commonwealth's major military defeat in the [[Second Northern War]] during the reign of Sigismund's younger son, [[John II Casimir]], under the terms and conditions of the [[Treaty of Oliva]], Prussia became a sovereign state and country that eventually [[Partitions of Poland|Partition Poland]] together with Austria and the Russian Empire in the late 18th century</span>

				<span class='text'>if|thumb|Engraving of Sigismund III]]===Zamoyski's bitterness and Sigismund's lust for power==={{unreferenced|section|date=November 2015}}The contest between the King and the Chancellor began during Sigismund's first Sejm sitting, the so-called &quot;Pacification Sejm&quot;, which met at Warsaw in March 1589</span>
				<span class='text'>Zamoyski presented the project of a political combination between Poland, [[Moscovy]], and [[Bohemia]], coupled with a suggestion that in case the present King should die without issue (a somewhat premature and gratuitous assumption in the circumstances) none but a Prince of some Slavonic stock should henceforth be eligible to the Polish throne</span>
				<span class='text'>The extravagance of a project which could even imagine the possibility of any sort of union between [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Poland, [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]] Moscovy, and semi-Protestant Bohemia struck even the majority of the Sejm with amazement</span>
				<span class='text'>It was only explicable at all as a circuitous and clumsy attempt to traverse the [[Habsburg]] influence</span>
				<span class='text'>The Parliament promptly rejected it, accepting instead the royal proposition of a marriage between Sigismund and the [[Anne of Austria|Archduchess Anne]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The way had already been opened for this rapprochement with Austria by the [[Treaty of Bytom and Będzin]] (March 1589), negotiated by the Nuncio Ippolito Aldobrandini, afterwards Pope [[Clement VIII]], whereby the Emperor resigned all his claims to the Polish Crown</span>
				<span class='text'>t the succeeding Sejm, which assembled in March 1590, Zamoyski succeeded in persuading the deputies to exclude at any rate the Archduke Maximilian from the succession to the throne</span>
				<span class='text'>But he had only gained his ends by skilfully frightening them with the bugbears of Austrian intrigues and Turkish threats; and his opponents, headed by the Primate Kamkowski, immediately after the Diet rose, formed a Confederation to protest against its decrees, and a second extraordinary Sejm, dominated by the enemies of Zamoyski, met at the end of the same year</span>
				<span class='text'>It at once proceeded to reverse all the decrees of its predecessor and strike blow after blow at the [[Chancellor of the Crown]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus the Grand-Hetmanship was placed in commission, the party of Maximilian was amnestied, the Zborowskis were rehabilitated, Zamoyski's friends and supporters were removed from Court, and the chief pillars of the Catholic party in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], the wealthy Cardinal Radziwiłł and the newly converted and highly popular Prince [[Ostrogski]], were appointed [[Bishop of Kraków]] and Castellan of Kraków respectively</span>
				<span class='text'>Zamoyski naturally retaliated by means of the same double-edged constitutional weapon which his opponent had used</span>
				<span class='text'>==Personal differences and attitudes===On 1 June 1592, he formed a Confederation at [[Jędrzejów]], which was more numerously attended than the wedding feast in honour of Sigismund's young Austrian bride the Archduchess Anne, who made her state entry into Kraków, amidst great rejoicings, at the end of May</span>
				<span class='text'>All the [[Szlachta|Polish nobility]], nearly all the senators of [[Greater Poland|Greater]] and [[Lesser Poland]], and the majority of the orthodox Lithuanians acceded to the Chancellor, so that, at the meeting of the &quot;Inquisition Sejm&quot; at Warsaw (7 August) summoned by the King to inquire into all grievances and thoroughly sift the so-called &quot;Austrian cabals&quot;, Zamoyski was once more formidable</span>
				<span class='text'>Sigismund, supported by the [[Primate of Poland]], had still enough authority to stop the inquisition half-way, but the young Queen's mother, the shrewd and sensible Archduchess Maria, who had accompanied her daughter to Kraków, had made up her mind that Zamoyski was too strong to be set aside, and that therefore the interests of Austria demanded a reconciliation between the King and the Chancellor</span>
				<span class='text'>This reconciliation was accomplished quietly by [[Mikołaj Firlej (?-1588)|Mikołaj Firlej]], Palatine of [[Kraków]], and included all the leading men of both parties</span>
				<span class='text'>The rival cardinals [[Bathory]] and [[Radziwiłł]] adjusted all their past differences; Zamoyski was fully reinstated in the Grand-Hetmanship, and as [[Grand Chancellor of the Crown]], to the general astonishment, presented to the Sejm and eloquently defended all the royal propositions, including Sigismund's request for leave to proceed to Sweden to occupy the throne left vacant by the death of his father John III, on 17 November 1592</span>
				<span class='text'>This reconciliation lasted for a long period of time, with the happiest results for Poland</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Zamoyski]], no longer distracted by personal considerations, gave his whole attention to public affairs, and, from 1595 to 1602, achieved some of his most brilliant military and political triumphs</span>

				<span class='text'>From the middle and lower classes, whom it had crushed beneath its feet, nothing was to be feared</span>
				<span class='text'>But the King, as the nominal head of the State, as the controller of foreign affairs through his official counselors, the Senate and the Chancellors, and, as the head of the army, through the [[Hetmans]], whom he appointed, was still a potential menace to individual liberty as the nobility understood it</span>
				<span class='text'>Henceforth, therefore, an unreasonable, incur-able suspicion of the Crown, and all the executive instruments of the Crown, is the characteristic, or rather the mania, of every [[Sejm|Polish Sejm]]</span>
				<span class='text'>For its country, as a State, the nobles had no thought at all</span>
				<span class='text'>As long as every nobleman, or squire, was lord paramount in his own parish he cared little for anything beyond it</span>
				<span class='text'>And what, after all, was the Sejm, or Diet, but a collection of some 600 of such squires who met annually at [[Warsaw]] or elsewhere, in order to contribute as little as possible to public needs and protest vehemently against everything they did not like or could not understand</span>
				<span class='text'>So far as they can be said to have had any policy at all, the nobility was in favour of absolute non-intervention in foreign affairs, as being the cheapest and least troublesome policy to pursue</span>
				<span class='text'>The unwillingness with which the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|gentry of Poland]] parted with their money, especially for armaments, however necessary, was entirely due to the fear lest a popular monarch, at the head of a victorious army, might curtail their [[privilege (social inequality)|privileges]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Rather than run such a risk as this, they were ready to avoid every advantageous [[Political alliance|alliance]], forgo every political opportunity, stint their armies, starve and abandon their generals, and even leave the territories of the Commonwealth unguarded and undefended</span>
				<span class='text'>Then, if ever, Polish statesmen had the opportunity of realising the [[Jagiellonians|Jagiellonic]] dream of an Empire, the political situation everywhere favoured them</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Livonia]], with its fine seaboard and its hundreds of towns and fortresses, had literally fallen into the lap of Poland</span>
				<span class='text'>Her one serious rival in the north was the rude young [[Swedish monarchy]], for [[Moscovy]], after the death of [[Ivan IV]] (1584), had ceased to be dangerous</span>
				<span class='text'>The Turks, unless violently shaken, was inclined to slumber</span>
				<span class='text'>The Emperor and the Western Powers were more or less involved in the Spanish and, subsequently, in the [[Thirty Years' War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The regular army, if small, was good, while in the Polish occupied Ukraine ([[Ruthenia]]) had an almost unlimited reserve of the best raw military material</span>
				<span class='text'>The country had Zamoyski, Żółkiewski, Chodkiewicz and [[Stanisław Koniecpolski]], four of the greatest generals and military commanders of the age</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1580, the Turks threatened to invade Poland from lands north of the Black Sea</span>
				<span class='text'>The good will of Poland was crucial to England because [[trade]] with countries bordering the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] was the source of grain and the all important forest products needed to maintain the navy</span>
				<span class='text'>English merchants enjoyed preferential trading privileges in Poland</span>
				<span class='text'>Elizabeth's intercession with the Caliphate was credited with cancelling the invasion, and she received letters of praise from then reigning Polish king, [[Stephen Bathory]]</span>

				<span class='text'>On 23 July 1587, the Privy Council instructs the [[Lord Mayor of London]] to arrange housing for the diplomat, preferably with a merchant prominent in the Baltic trade</span>
				<span class='text'>To insure Elizabeth will not find fault with the preparations, the Lord Mayor is to report the arrangements made</span>

				<span class='text'>He then strode to the center of the chamber without any forewarning of what he was about to say, and instead of the oration of a legate that everyone anticipated―couched in respectful words to flatter the monarch being addressed―he spoke as a herald</span>
				<span class='text'>In Latin, he hectored, admonished and criticized the queen, and declared an ultimatum of capitulation to terms or hostile action</span>

				<span class='text'>The reason for his mission was to complain about Elizabeth's policy of having her navy capture ships of Polish and [[Hanseatic League]] merchants trading with Spain</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|Sigismund in Spanish costume]]After Sigismund had been crowned King of Sweden 19 February 1594, he decided that no [[Riksdag of the Estates|Parliaments]] (''riksdagar'') could be summoned without the King's consent</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite this, Charles summoned a Parliament at [[Söderköping]] in autumn 1595, at which he managed to get his will through</span>
				<span class='text'>The Duke was appointed [[Regent]] with &quot;the advice of the Council&quot;, meaning that he was to govern Sweden together with the [[Privy Council of Sweden|Privy Council]] during the King's absence from the Realm</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon afterwards, the nobility of [[Sweden–Finland|Finland]], led by the Sigismund-appointed Governor, [[Klaus Fleming]], rejected these decisions</span>
				<span class='text'>They sympathised with the King and considered Charles a rebel</span>
				<span class='text'>As a counterattack, Charles instigated a rebellion against Fleming, the [[Cudgel War]], among the farmers in [[Ostrobothnia (historical province)|Ostrobothnia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Frost, R</span>

				<span class='text'> 2000, ''The Northern Wars, 1558–1721'', Harlow: Pearson education Limited, ISBN 9780582064294&lt;/ref&gt;Fleming managed to quell the revolt but died in April 1597</span>
				<span class='text'>Roughly at the same time, a letter arrived from Sigismund's headquarters in Poland stating that he would not accept Charles as regent</span>
				<span class='text'>The Duke then used a tactic which his father had employed, namely to resign from office</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the response was not what Charles had been hoping for: the King accepted Charles's resignation and invested complete power in the Privy Council</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite the difficult situation, Charles summoned another illegal Parliament the same year, this time in [[Arboga]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Only one of the Privy Councillors showed up</span>
				<span class='text'>The reason was that Charles's goal of deposing Sigismund had now been revealed, and the men understood that a serious revolt was brewing</span>
				<span class='text'>When Duke Charles threatened the absent men with severe punishment some of them lost courage</span>
				<span class='text'>Erik Gustavsson Stenbock, Arvid Gustavsson Stenbock, [[:sv:Erik Larsson Sparre|Erik Larsson Sparre]], [[:sv:Erik Brahe (1552–1614)|Erik Brahe]] and [[:sv:Sten Banér|Sten Banér]] fled immediately to Sigismund</span>
				<span class='text'>==Eruption of a civil war===Thus, in 1597, civil war erupted, and Duke Charles was able to assume control over a large share of the powerful castles in the country, and in this manner achieved control over almost all the Realm</span>
				<span class='text'>The problem was Finland, where Klaus Fleming's widow guarded [[Turku Castle|Åbo castle]]</span>
				<span class='text'>But after [[psychological warfare]], Charles and his followers managed to take the castle in Turku ({{lang-sv|Åbo}})</span>
				<span class='text'>It is said that when the Duke entered the castle chapel he saw Klaus Fleming's body lying in a coffin</span>
				<span class='text'>He is said to have said: &quot;Hadst thou now been alive, thy head would not have been in great safety</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Then Fleming's widow [[Ebba Stenbock]] is said to have approached the Duke and responded: &quot;If my late husband had been alive, Your Grace would never have entered herein</span>

				<span class='text'> 2000, ''The Northern Wars, 1558–1721'', Harlow: Pearson Education Limited, ISBN 9780582064294&lt;/ref&gt;When Sigismund found out about what had happened in Finland he lost his patience</span>
				<span class='text'>The King could not accept Duke Charles's disrespectful actions and decided to use force</span>
				<span class='text'>This decision eventually would cost him the Swedish crown</span>
				<span class='text'>In February 1598 Sigismund assembled an army consisting of merely 5,000 men, mostly Hungarian and German mercenaries</span>
				<span class='text'>A larger army had been proposed, but had been dismissed since Sigismund expected Swedish forces to join him, and also did not want to come into conflict with them</span>
				<span class='text'>The advisers and the King expected military support from [[Sweden–Finland|Finland]] and [[Swedish Estonia|Estonia]] (homes of the Swedish gentry formerly commanded by [[Klaus Fleming|baron Klaus Fleming]])</span>
				<span class='text'>They also wanted help from [[Denmark–Norway]] and pro-Sigismund parts of Sweden</span>
				<span class='text'>The diplomat Laski was dispatched, but Denmark did not show any interest</span>
				<span class='text'>In May, Sigismund's men started to advance northwards</span>
				<span class='text'>The army gathered in [[Malbork|Marienburg]] (Malbork), where the [[Livonian people|Livonian]] Jürgen Farensbach was appointed commander</span>
				<span class='text'>The army was to be transported from [[Danzig]] (Gdańsk) to Sweden on Swedish ships, but the Swedish Estates declined</span>
				<span class='text'>They refused to lend him ships as long as he stayed with a foreign army</span>
				<span class='text'>There was widespread suspicion against Sigismund and his Catholic warriors</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus the Estates promised to protect Duke Charles and the others who rebelled against the King</span>
				<span class='text'>==Military actions and campaign===At the end of May 1598 Sigismund landed on Swedish soil at [[Avaskär]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The King opened peacefully by sending the diplomat Samuel Łaski to [[Kalmar]] for negotiations</span>
				<span class='text'>His task was to convince the city's commanders to open the gates</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the negotiations led nowhere</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, the King took his soldiers and marched on Kalmar</span>
				<span class='text'>The army halted just outside the city</span>
				<span class='text'>The plan was to frighten the commanders into opening the gates</span>
				<span class='text'>To make his message even more terrifying, Sigismund threatened the city with severe punishments and to withdraw the nobility of all children in the city</span>
				<span class='text'>The propaganda worked well and Sigismund was able to make his long-desired entry on 1 August</span>
				<span class='text'>After the fall of Kalmar, Duke Charles found himself with major trouble on his hands</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Military of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish Crown army]] attracted Swedish followers and Stockholm, lacking military defence, was easily taken with the help of the nobility and officers of [[Götaland]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After this event, the cavalry of [[Uppland]] joined up, and new forces were mobilised in Finland and [[Swedish Estonia|Estonia]]</span>

				<span class='text'> 2000, ''The Northern Wars, 1558–1721'', Harlow: Pearson Education Limited, ISBN 9780582064294&lt;/ref&gt;The morning of 25 September 1598 the armies clashed in a major engagement at the [[Battle of Stångebro]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Charles offered talks again but attacked in a mist while Sigismund's men were withdrawing to their camp, which resulted in only the mercenaries fighting since his Swedes refused to fight</span>
				<span class='text'>Duke Charles won a decisive victory which forced Sigismund to agree to harsh terms</span>
				<span class='text'>Charles demanded that the King send home his entire army, but that he himself was to stay and await a Parliament</span>
				<span class='text'>Also, a number of Swedes who had sided with Sigismund, including his Council supporters, were captured</span>
				<span class='text'>These were later executed in the [[Linköping Bloodbath]] of 1600</span>
				<span class='text'>The peace agreement was sealed with a dinner between Charles and Sigismund on [[Linköping Castle]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The King, who was under pressure, fearing for his life without his army and having realised that he had lost the political battle, fled during the coming days to Poland in late 1598</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time as the peace treaty was being signed in Linköping, conflicts were taking place in [[Dalarna]]</span>
				<span class='text'>There, a pro-Sigismund bailiff, [[:sv:Jacob Näf|Jacob Näf]], had tried to raise up the [[Dalecarlian]]s against Duke Charles</span>
				<span class='text'>Chaos ensued</span>
				<span class='text'>Näf was executed, and the Dalecarlians set out on the so-called Neaf Campaign (1598), burning and killing down to Brunnbäck ferry</span>
				<span class='text'>In [[Västergötland]], [[Carl Carlsson Gyllenhielm]], illegitimate son of Duke Charles, defeated the rebellion</span>
				<span class='text'>==Aftermath and peace settlement===Sigismund was officially deposed from the throne of Sweden by a Parliament, [[Riksdag]], held in Stockholm on 24 July 1599</span>
				<span class='text'>He was given six months to say whether he wanted to send his son</span>
				<span class='text'>Prince [[Władysław IV Vasa|Władysław Vasa]], to Sweden as his successor, under the condition that the boy would be brought up in the Evangelical faith</span>
				<span class='text'> Otherwise the Estates would look for a new king</span>
				<span class='text'>In February 1600, Duke Charles summoned the Estates of the Realm to Linköping</span>
				<span class='text'>Since Sigismund had not provided a reply, the Estates elected Duke Charles as King [[Charles IX of Sweden]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The consequences for those who had supported Sigismund were devastating</span>
				<span class='text'>The most prominent among them were killed by the new King, in what was called the &quot;[[Linköping Bloodbath]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>During the winter and spring of 1600, Charles also occupied the Swedish part of Estonia, as the castle commanders had shown sympathies towards Sigismund</span>
				<span class='text'>Charles' invasion of [[Livonia]] led to a series of wars with Poland, starting with the [[Polish–Swedish War (1600–29)|Second Polish–Swedish War]]</span>

				<span class='text'>It was primarily caused by the growing dissatisfaction with the King among the [[Szlachta|Polish nobility]] and wealthy [[magnates]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In particular, the rebels disapproved of the King's efforts to limit the power of the nobles, his attempts to weaken the [[Sejm]] (the Polish parliament) and to introduce a hereditary monarchy in place of the elective one</span>
				<span class='text'>The rebellion (1606–08) ended in the defeat of the rebels</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite the failure to overthrow the King, the rebellion firmly established the dominance of the nobility over the monarch in the Polish political system</span>

				<span class='text'>rg/t/Zebrzydowski_Rebellion&lt;/ref&gt;The Polish nobles gathered at the rebellion-formed a council and outlined their demands in 67 articles</span>
				<span class='text'>They demanded Sigismund III's dethronement for breaching the [[Henrician Articles]], and the expulsion of the [[Jesuits]] from the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]</span>
				<span class='text'>They further demanded that the Sejm was appoint state officials instead of the king; that local officials should be elected and not appointed and that Protestant's rights should be expanded and protected</span>
				<span class='text'>The 1607 Parliament sitting rejected the demands</span>
				<span class='text'>Meanwhile, the rebel nobles gathered in the town of [[Guzów, Szydłowiec County|Guzów]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1607 the [[Military of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish Royal Army]], led by [[Hetman]] [[Jan Karol Chodkiewicz]] was sent to pacify the rebels</span>
				<span class='text'>A full-scale battle ensued on 5 July, with 200 casualties, which resulted in the victory of the Royalist forces</span>
				<span class='text'>By 1609, the rebellion was over</span>
				<span class='text'>Two years after the start of the revolt, the rebellious nobles formally surrendered to the king at the 1609 meeting of the [[Sejm]], which became known as the [[Pacification Sejm]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In return for their surrender the rebels were granted leniency</span>
				<span class='text'>Many royal supporters, including Hetman Chodkiewicz, had successfully argued for amnesty for the rebels</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|250px|''[[Skarga's Sermon]]'', by [[Jan Matejko]]]]The election of Sigismund III to the throne proved to be the greatest blow it was possible to inflict upon [[Protestanism]] in Poland</span>
				<span class='text'>Brought up by his mother, [[Catherine Jagiellon]], in the strictest [[Roman Catholic]] doctrines, he made the promotion of the interests of Rome the guiding motive of all his actions</span>
				<span class='text'>This zeal for Rome outweighed all considerations of prudence or policy; through it he lost two hereditary thrones, and brought innumerable calamities on the country which election had handed over to him, &quot;In order to make sure of heaven&quot;,  said the Emperor Ferdinand, &quot;he has renounced earth&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The Protestants called him the ''&quot;King of the Jesuits&quot;'', and Sigismund gloried in the appellation</span>
				<span class='text'>This feeble imitation of [[Philip II of Spain]] possessed all the bigotry and zeal of his model without his abilities or strength of character</span>
				<span class='text'>In all that he did he was ruled by the [[Jesuits]]; he bestowed honours only on those whom they favoured, and preferred their advice to that of his wisest counselors</span>
				<span class='text'>By private interviews, wrote a Roman Catholic historian who was also bishop of [[Przemyśl]], which they could always command, the Jesuits so bound the king by their solicitations, that he did everything according to their counsel, and the hopes and cares of courtiers had no weight except by their favour</span>
				<span class='text'>Chief among these advisers of the king was [[Piotr Skarga]], one of the most eminent of Polish Jesuits</span>
				<span class='text'>Born in [[Mazovia]] in 1536, he was educated at the [[Jagiellonian University]], where he distinguished himself by winning the ''prima Laurea''</span>
				<span class='text'>He then proceeded to Rome, where he entered the society in 1568</span>
				<span class='text'>He began his preaching at [[Pułtusk]], and visited the colleges which [[Stephen Bathory]] had founded at [[Riga]], [[Dorpat]] and [[Połock]]; his eloquence was very successful, and even now his sermons are thought highly of in Poland</span>
				<span class='text'>On the accession of Sigismund he became royal chaplain and he founded a confraternity of St</span>

				<span class='text'>tml&lt;/ref&gt;==Relationship with the Mennonites==Sigismund confirmed the contracts of lease made with the [[Mennonites]] and on 20 October 1623, accorded special privileges to the lace-makers originating from [[Scotland]], most of whom were Mennonites</span>
				<span class='text'>But he refused to grant them any new rights or liberties</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon the complaint of the city council of [[Elbing]] (Elbląg) that the Mennonites broke up marriages without having previously informed the authorities, married one another, and divided property at their pleasure, he forbade the Mennonites, upon penalty of a fine of 100 [[guilders]], to marry without the foreknowledge of the authorities, and ordered that the Mennonites should be given no special rights</span>
				<span class='text'>When the Mennonites nevertheless requested release from all civil handicaps, especially from military [[defense (military)|defense]] of the city and the [[Oath|court oath]], he decreed on 26 April 1615, that they should do their duty like others</span>
				<span class='text'>But the ruling was not enforced</span>
				<span class='text'>On 26 April 1626, the king sent the following orders to the magistrate of Elbing, because he had heard that they had accepted [[Anabaptists]] and Mennonites and given them [[liberty|liberties]], so that they, without swearing to him and the city, carried on trade and crafts, bought properties and food from the citizens, and tolerated them free of all that citizens must assume, and, what was not the least, their testimony at court was counted as valid as an oath, all of which is contrary to the public and special laws and offended his royal regard sorely and threatened to do harm, therefore these people were held to sworn obligations to the king and the city, to take up all civil burdens</span>

				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|right|''Assassination attempt on King Sigismund by Michał Piekarski in 1620'']][[File:Kanonia Street in Warsaw - the link between the Royal Castle and the Cathedral - 03</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|The little bridge between the [[Royal Castle, Warsaw|Castle]] and the Cathedral where Sigismund was attacked]]An unsuccessful attempt on the life of the king was made on 15 November 1620</span>
				<span class='text'>It occurred on Sunday, at 9 am, when the monarch was to attend Mass in [[St</span>
				<span class='text'>John's Archcathedral (Warsaw)|St</span>
				<span class='text'>John's Archcathedral in Warsaw]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Sigismund was to arrive by walking on a wooden bridge-looking construction that connected the [[Royal Castle, Warsaw|Royal Castle]] with the temple</span>
				<span class='text'>When the royal procession already reached the end of the bridge, hidden in a nearby window was nobleman Michał Piekarski</span>
				<span class='text'>The assassin previously killed a [[Mercenary|Hungarian mercenary]] that was protecting the post</span>
				<span class='text'>When the monarch reached the final steps, Piekarski instantly jumped out and threw himself on the king, stabbing him twice, firstly in the back and then in the cheek, another hit was in the arm, however, the assassin was not able to cause any deadly harm because of the royal guards that were initially standing to the right of the king and Piekarski attacked from the left</span>
				<span class='text'>Shortly after this, Sigismund fell flat on the ground, pale and lifeless, and from the church Priest Kobierzycki started to groan and shout – he has seen the attack from the temple's stained glass window or from the belfry</span>
				<span class='text'>A group of local civilians and citizens surrounded the procession, the king quickly fainted and his clothes were stained in blood, however, the guards were able to revive the monarch</span>
				<span class='text'>Eventually after medical examinations the wounds proved to be harmless</span>

				<span class='text'>tml&lt;/ref&gt; Few minutes later, panic erupted in the crowd and the air filled with the atmosphere of terror</span>
				<span class='text'>Most of the people gathered in the church, that have arrived before the royal procession, believed that the king was already dead</span>
				<span class='text'>Initially it was thought that the capital was invaded by the Muslim [[Tatars]] or, at least, by their spies</span>

				<span class='text'>tml&lt;/ref&gt;The circumstances of this attack and the assassin were known exceptionally well after the attempt, as soon pamphlets appeared on the Market Square, reporting three different viewpoints on the subject, published in a total of five editions</span>
				<span class='text'>The assassin was indeed Michał Piekarski, always regarded by the society as a freak, a [[Depression (mood)|melancholic]], unrestrained in deeds (as a child he suffered head and brain damage – this may have been the cause of his mental illness)</span>
				<span class='text'>Earlier, he murdered the royal cook and killed, and wounded several people from the royal court</span>
				<span class='text'>Piekarski, after hearing the news of the successful assassination of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] in Paris (1610), decided to assassinate Sigismund, simply for fame</span>
				<span class='text'>For the appropriate moment he waited patiently for 10 years</span>
				<span class='text'>At trial he did not deny the crime he committed and heavily insulted both the jury, the Court Marshal and the monarch</span>
				<span class='text'>He was executed in exactly the same way as [[François Ravaillac]] (the killer of the French king) on 26 November 1620 in Warsaw, in a torture area called ''Piekiełko'' (Devil's den or Devil's place)</span>

				<span class='text'>tml&lt;/ref&gt;==Thirty Years' War=={{main|Thirty Years' War}}Sigismund III would have intervened in the [[Thirty Years' War]], on the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] side, but for the determined opposition of the Parliament ([[Sejm]]), expressing itself in fresh insurrections and the refusal of supplies</span>
				<span class='text'>His intervention would have taken the form of an invasion and, possibly, an occupation of [[Transylvania]], which, under the energetic and ambitious Princes of the Protestant Houses of [[Bethlen]] and [[Rakoczy]] was the active ally of the [[Sultan]] and equally dangerous to [[Habsburg Austria]] and Poland</span>
				<span class='text'>This would result in a war that would devastate the eastern borderlands of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, known as the ''[[Kresy]]'', and Sigismund was aware that he would not stand a chance against the mighty Sultan and the entire, great [[Ottoman Empire]] stretching from the Middle East all the way to the [[Balkans]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The best heads in Poland, including [[Hetman]] [[Stanisław Żółkiewski]], warmly approved of the King's policy in this respect, but it proved to be impracticable</span>
				<span class='text'>The Parliament's mania for non-intervention went so far that it refused to grant any subsidies for the Swedish War with the disastrous consequences already recorded</span>
				<span class='text'>Sigismund eventually decided that joining the Thirty Years' War would diminish the country's national [[Reputation|prestige]] and power in the region</span>
				<span class='text'>This, however, weakened the alliance between the Habsburg states and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth</span>

				<span class='text'>vg|right|180px|Coat of arms of Sigismund III as King of Poland]]The reign of King Sigismund III of Poland is often spoken of as the beginning of the end of [[Polish Golden Age|Polish greatness]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In terms of worldly success he certainly met with many defeats and setbacks</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet, he was also one of the great Catholic champions of Europe and his reign can also be seen as one of many opportunities for an even greater Poland</span>
				<span class='text'>He was stubborn, but a man of principle who would follow the hard but upright path rather than compromise his values for a more sure chance at success</span>
				<span class='text'>As a monarch who reigned during the Catholic Reformation (also called the counter-reformation) he constantly worked to see the restoration of all of his subjects to the true faith embodied in the [[Archdiocese of Rome|Church of Rome]] headed by the [[Pope]] of the Roman Catholic Church</span>
				<span class='text'>Oddly enough for such a staunchly Catholic monarch his story begins in the staunchly Protestant [[Kingdom of Sweden]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Sigismund's rule is often criticized in Poland for his unsuccessful decisions that negatively affected the diplomatic and financial situation of the country, however, especially by the nationalists, he is widely praised for conquering the eastern empires and gaining territories for the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, thus creating the largest country in Europe of the 16th and 17th century that lasted until the final partition in 1795</span>
