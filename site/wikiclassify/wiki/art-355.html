				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;By the 1490s Leonardo had already been described as a &quot;Divine&quot; painter</span>
				<span class='text'>His fame is discussed by Daniel Arasse in ''Leonardo da Vinci'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>11–15&lt;/ref&gt;These paintings are famous for a variety of qualities which have been much imitated by students and discussed at great length by connoisseurs and critics</span>
				<span class='text'>Among the qualities that make Leonardo's work unique are the innovative techniques which he used in laying on the paint, his detailed knowledge of anatomy, light, botany and geology, his interest in [[physiognomy]] and the way in which humans register emotion in expression and gesture, his innovative use of the human form in figurative composition, and his use of the subtle gradation of tone</span>
				<span class='text'>All these qualities come together in his most famous painted works, the ''Mona Lisa'', the ''Last Supper'' and the ''Virgin of the Rocks''</span>

				<span class='text'>It shows specifically the moment when Jesus has just said &quot;one of you will betray me&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>In the present era it is arguably the most famous painting in the world</span>
				<span class='text'>Its fame rests, in particular, on the elusive smile on the woman's face, its mysterious quality brought about perhaps by the fact that the artist has subtly shadowed the corners of the mouth and eyes so that the exact nature of the smile cannot be determined</span>

				<span class='text'>Vasari, who is generally thought to have known the painting only by repute, said that &quot;the smile was so pleasing that it seemed divine rather than human; and those who saw it were amazed to find that it was as alive as the original&quot;</span>
