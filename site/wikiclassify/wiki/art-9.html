				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bruce|1990|pp=17-19}}===First invention===As a child, young Bell displayed a natural curiosity about his world, resulting in gathering botanical specimens as well as experimenting even at an early age</span>
				<span class='text'>His best friend was Ben Herdman, a neighbor whose family operated a flour mill, the scene of many forays</span>
				<span class='text'>Young Bell asked what needed to be done at the mill</span>
				<span class='text'>He was told wheat had to be dehusked through a laborious process and at the age of 12, Bell built a homemade device that combined rotating paddles with sets of nail brushes, creating a simple dehusking machine that was put into operation and used steadily for a number of years</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bruce|1990|p=16}} In return, John Herdman gave both boys the run of a small workshop in which to &quot;invent&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bruce|1990|p=16}}From his early years, Bell showed a sensitive nature and a talent for art, poetry, and music that was encouraged by his mother</span>
				<span class='text'>With no formal training, he mastered the piano and became the family's pianist</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Gray|2006|p=8}} Despite being normally quiet and introspective, he reveled in mimicry and &quot;voice tricks&quot; akin to [[ventriloquism]] that continually entertained family guests during their occasional visits</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Gray|2006|p=8}} Bell was also deeply affected by his mother's gradual deafness, (she began to lose her hearing when he was 12) and learned a manual finger language so he could sit at her side and tap out silently the conversations swirling around the family parlour</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Gray|2006|p=9}} He also developed a technique of speaking in clear, modulated tones directly into his mother's forehead wherein she would hear him with reasonable clarity</span>

				<span class='text'>is family was long associated with the teaching of elocution: his grandfather, Alexander Bell, in London, his uncle in [[Dublin]], and his father, in Edinburgh, were all elocutionists</span>
				<span class='text'>His father published a variety of works on the subject, several of which are still well known, especially his ''The Standard Elocutionist'' (1860),{{sfn|Gray|2006|p=8}} which appeared in Edinburgh in 1868</span>
				<span class='text'>''The Standard Elocutionist'' appeared in 168 British editions and sold over a quarter of a million copies in the United States alone</span>
				<span class='text'>In this treatise, his father explains his methods of how to instruct [[deaf-mute]]s (as they were then known) to articulate words and read other people's lip movements to decipher meaning</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Petrie|1975|p=7}} Bell became so proficient that he became a part of his father's public demonstrations and astounded audiences with his abilities</span>

				<span class='text'>At an early age, however, he was enrolled at the [[Royal High School (Edinburgh)|Royal High School]], Edinburgh, Scotland, which he left at age 15, completing only the first four forms</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Mackay|1997|p=31}} His school record was undistinguished, marked by absenteeism and lacklustre grades</span>
				<span class='text'>His main interest remained in the sciences, especially biology, while he treated other school subjects with indifference, to the dismay of his demanding father</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Gray|2006|p=11}} Upon leaving school, Bell travelled to London to live with his grandfather, Alexander Bell</span>
				<span class='text'>During the year he spent with his grandfather, a love of learning was born, with long hours spent in serious discussion and study</span>
				<span class='text'>The elder Bell took great efforts to have his young pupil learn to speak clearly and with conviction, the attributes that his pupil would need to become a teacher himself</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Groundwater|2005|p=25}}  The rudimentary &quot;mechanical man&quot; simulated a human voice</span>
				<span class='text'>Bell was fascinated by the machine and after he obtained a copy of von Kempelen's book, published in German, and had laboriously translated it, he and his older brother Melville built their own automaton head</span>
				<span class='text'>Their father, highly interested in their project, offered to pay for any supplies and spurred the boys on with the enticement of a &quot;big prize&quot; if they were successful</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Groundwater|2005|p=25}} While his brother constructed the throat and [[larynx]], Bell tackled the more difficult task of recreating a realistic skull</span>
				<span class='text'>His efforts resulted in a remarkably lifelike head that could &quot;speak&quot;, albeit only a few words</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Groundwater|2005|p=25}} The boys would carefully adjust the &quot;lips&quot; and when a [[bellows]] forced air through the [[Vertebrate trachea|windpipe]], a very recognizable &quot;Mama&quot; ensued, to the delight of neighbors who came to see the Bell invention</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Petrie|1975|pp=7-9}}Intrigued by the results of the automaton, Bell continued to experiment with a live subject, the family's [[Skye Terrier]], &quot;Trouve&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Petrie|1975|p=9}} After he taught it to growl continuously, Bell would reach into its mouth and manipulate the dog's lips and [[Vocal folds|vocal cords]] to produce a crude-sounding &quot;Ow ah oo ga ma ma&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Bell had filed the mercury application at the patent office a year earlier on February 25, 1875, long before Elisha Gray described the water device</span>

				<span class='text'>The following night, he amazed guests as well as his family when a message was received at the Bell home from Brantford, four miles (six km) distant, along an improvised wire strung up along telegraph lines and fences, and laid through a tunnel</span>
				<span class='text'>This time, guests at the household distinctly heard people in Brantford reading and singing</span>

				<span class='text'>According to one of his biographers, [[Charlotte Gray (author)|Charlotte Gray]], Bell's work ranged &quot;unfettered across the scientific landscape&quot; and he often went to bed voraciously reading the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', scouring it for new areas of interest</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Gray|2006|p=219}} The range of Bell's inventive genius is represented only in part by the 18 patents granted in his name alone and the 12 he shared with his collaborators</span>

				<span class='text'>ell worked extensively in [[medical research]] and invented techniques for teaching speech to the deaf</span>

				<span class='text'>Although the trio briefly experimented with the concept, they could not develop a workable prototype</span>
				<span class='text'>They abandoned the idea, never realizing they had glimpsed a basic principle which would one day find its application in the [[tape recorder]], the [[hard disc]] and [[floppy disc]] drive and other [[magnetic medium|magnetic media]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ell's own home used a primitive form of air conditioning, in which fans blew currents of air across great blocks of ice</span>
				<span class='text'>He also anticipated modern concerns with fuel shortages and industrial pollution</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Methane]] gas, he reasoned, could be produced from the waste of farms and factories</span>

				<span class='text'>The extent of the [area that produced a response from the detector] having been so small, as compared with the area of the bed, it seemed reasonable to conclude that the steel mattress had produced no detrimental effect</span>
