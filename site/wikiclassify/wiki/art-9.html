				<span class='text'>  His father was Professor  a  and his mother was Eliza Grace née Symonds</span>
				<span class='text'> Born as just Alexander Bell at age 10 he made a plea to his father to have a middle name like his two brothers</span>
				<span class='text'> For his 11th birthday his father acquiesced and allowed him to adopt the name Graham chosen out of respect for Alexander Graham a Canadian being treated by his father who had become a family friend</span>
				<span class='text'> To close relatives and friends he remained Aleck</span>
				<span class='text'>s a child young Bell displayed a natural curiosity about his world resulting in gathering botanical specimens as well as experimenting even at an early age</span>
				<span class='text'>His best friend was Ben Herdman a neighbor whose family operated a flour mill the scene of many forays</span>
				<span class='text'>Young Bell asked what needed to be done at the mill</span>
				<span class='text'>He was told wheat had to be dehusked through a laborious process and at the age of 12 Bell built a homemade device that combined rotating paddles with sets of nail brushes creating a simple dehusking machine that was put into operation and used steadily for a number of years</span>
				<span class='text'>In return John Herdman gave both boys the run of a small workshop in which to invent</span>
				<span class='text'>rom his early years Bell showed a sensitive nature and a talent for art poetry and music that was encouraged by his mother</span>
				<span class='text'>With no formal training he mastered the piano and became the familys pianist</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite being normally quiet and introspective he reveled in mimicry and voice tricks akin to  that continually entertained family guests during their occasional visits</span>
				<span class='text'>Bell was also deeply affected by his mothers gradual deafness she began to lose her hearing when he was 12 and learned a manual finger language so he could sit at her side and tap out silently the conversations swirling around the family parlour</span>
				<span class='text'>He also developed a technique of speaking in clear modulated tones directly into his mothers forehead wherein she would hear him with reasonable clarity</span>
				<span class='text'> Bells preoccupation with his mothers deafness led him to study </span>
				<span class='text'>is family was long associated with the teaching of elocution his grandfather Alexander Bell in London his uncle in  and his father in Edinburgh were all elocutionists</span>
				<span class='text'>His father published a variety of works on the subject several of which are still well known especially his The Standard Elocutionist 1860 which appeared in Edinburgh in 1868</span>
				<span class='text'>The Standard Elocutionist appeared in 168 British editions and sold over a quarter of a million copies in the United States alone</span>
				<span class='text'>In this treatise his father explains his methods of how to instruct s as they were then known to articulate words and read other peoples lip movements to decipher meaning</span>
				<span class='text'>Bells father taught him and his brothers not only to write  but to identify any symbol and its accompanying sound</span>
				<span class='text'>Bell became so proficient that he became a part of his fathers public demonstrations and astounded audiences with his abilities</span>
				<span class='text'>He could decipher Visible Speech representing virtually every language including   and even  accurately reciting written tracts without any prior knowledge of their pronunciation</span>
				<span class='text'>s a young child Bell like his brothers received his early schooling at home from his father</span>
				<span class='text'>At an early age however he was enrolled at the  Edinburgh Scotland which he left at age 15 completing only the first four forms</span>
				<span class='text'>His school record was undistinguished marked by absenteeism and lacklustre grades</span>
				<span class='text'>His main interest remained in the sciences especially biology while he treated other school subjects with indifference to the dismay of his demanding father</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon leaving school Bell travelled to London to live with his grandfather Alexander Bell</span>
				<span class='text'>During the year he spent with his grandfather a love of learning was born with long hours spent in serious discussion and study</span>
				<span class='text'>The elder Bell took great efforts to have his young pupil learn to speak clearly and with conviction the attributes that his pupil would need to become a teacher himself</span>
				<span class='text'> At age 16 Bell secured a position as a pupil teacher of  and music in Weston House Academy at  Scotland</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he was enrolled as a student in Latin and Greek he instructed classes himself in return for board and £10 per session</span>
				<span class='text'>The following year he attended the  joining his older brother Melville who had enrolled there the previous year</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1868 not long before he departed for Canada with his family Bell completed his matriculation exams and was accepted for admission to the </span>
				<span class='text'>His father encouraged Bells interest in speech and in 1863 took his sons to see a unique  developed by Sir  based on the earlier work of </span>
				<span class='text'> The rudimentary mechanical man simulated a human voice</span>
				<span class='text'>Bell was fascinated by the machine and after he obtained a copy of von Kempelens book published in German and had laboriously translated it he and his older brother Melville built their own automaton head</span>
				<span class='text'>Their father highly interested in their project offered to pay for any supplies and spurred the boys on with the enticement of a big prize if they were successful</span>
				<span class='text'>While his brother constructed the throat and  Bell tackled the more difficult task of recreating a realistic skull</span>
				<span class='text'>His efforts resulted in a remarkably lifelike head that could speak albeit only a few words</span>
				<span class='text'>The boys would caully adjust the lips and when a  forced air through the  a very recognizable Mama ensued to the delight of neighbors who came to see the Bell invention</span>
				<span class='text'>ntrigued by the results of the automaton Bell continued to experiment with a live subject the familys  Trouve</span>
				<span class='text'>After he taught it to growl continuously Bell would reach into its mouth and manipulate the dogs lips and  to produce a crude sounding Ow ah oo ga ma ma</span>
				<span class='text'>With little convincing visitors believed his dog could articulate How are you grandma More indicative of his playful nature his experiments convinced onlookers that they saw a talking dog</span>
				<span class='text'>However these initial forays into experimentation with sound led Bell to undertake his first serious work on the transmission of sound using s to explore </span>
				<span class='text'>t the age of 19 he wrote a report on his work and sent it to philologist  a colleague of his father who would later be portrayed as Professor Henry Higgins in </span>
				<span class='text'>Ellis immediately wrote back indicating that the experiments were similar to existing work in Germany and also lent Bell a copy of s work The Sensations of Tone as a Physiological Basis for the Theory of Music</span>
				<span class='text'>ismayed to find that groundbreaking work had already been undertaken by Helmholtz who had conveyed vowel sounds by means of a similar tuning fork contraption he pored over the German scientists book</span>
				<span class='text'>Working from his own erroneous mistranslation of a French edition name DCB   Bell fortuitously then made a deduction that would be the underpinning of all his future work on transmitting sound reporting Without knowing much about the subject it seemed to me that if vowel sounds could be produced by electrical means so could consonants so could articulate speech</span>
				<span class='text'> He also later remarked I thought that Helmholtz had done it </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>and that my failure was due only to my ignorance of electricity</span>
				<span class='text'>It was a valuable blunder </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>If I had been able to read German in those days I might never have commenced my experiments In 1865 when the Bell family moved to London  Bell returned to Weston House as an assistant master and in his spare hours continued experiments on sound using a minimum of laboratory equipment</span>
				<span class='text'>Bell concentrated on experimenting with electricity to convey sound and later installed a  wire from his room in Somerset College to that of a friend</span>
				<span class='text'>Throughout late 1867 his health faltered mainly through exhaustion</span>
				<span class='text'>His younger brother Edward Ted was similarly bed ridden suffering from </span>
				<span class='text'>While Bell recovered by then erring to himself in correspondence as A</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Bell and served the next year as an instructor at Somerset College  England his brothers condition deteriorated</span>
				<span class='text'>Edward would never recover</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon his brothers death Bell returned home in 1867</span>
				<span class='text'>His older brother Melville had married and moved out</span>
				<span class='text'>With aspirations to obtain a degree at  Bell considered his next years as preparation for the degree examinations devoting his spare time at his familys residence to studying</span>
				<span class='text'>elping his father in Visible Speech demonstrations and lectures brought Bell to Susanna E</span>
				<span class='text'>Hulls private school for the deaf in  London</span>
				<span class='text'>His first two pupils were deaf mute girls who made remarkable progress under his tutelage</span>
				<span class='text'>While his older brother seemed to achieve success on many fronts including opening his own elocution school applying for a patent on an invention and starting a family Bell continued as a teacher</span>
				<span class='text'>However in May 1870 Melville died from complications due to tuberculosis causing a family crisis</span>
				<span class='text'>His father had also suffered a debilitating illness earlier in life and had been restored to health by a convalescence in </span>
				<span class='text'>Bells parents embarked upon a long planned move when they realized that their remaining son was also sickly</span>
				<span class='text'>Acting decisively Alexander Melville Bell asked Bell to arrange for the sale of all the family property conclude all of his brothers affairs Bell took over his last student curing a pronounced lisp and join his father and mother in setting out for the </span>
				<span class='text'>Reluctantly Bell also had to conclude a relationship with Marie Eccleston who as he had surmised was not prepared to leave England with him</span>
				<span class='text'>anadaIn 1870 at age 23 Bell his brothers widow Caroline Margaret Ottaway and his parents travelled on the SS Nestorian to Canada</span>
				<span class='text'>After landing at  the Bells transferred to another steamer to  and then boarded a train to  to stay with the Reverend Thomas Henderson a family friend</span>
				<span class='text'>After a brief stay with the Hendersons the Bell family purchased a farm of  at Tutelo Heights now called Tutela Heights near  Ontario</span>
				<span class='text'>The property consisted of an orchard large farm house stable pigsty hen house and a  which bordered the </span>
				<span class='text'>t the homestead Bell set up his own workshop in the converted carriage house near to what he called his dreaming place  a large hollow nestled in trees at the back of the property above the river</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite his frail condition upon arriving in Canada Bell found the climate and environs to his liking and rapidly improved</span>
				<span class='text'>He continued his interest in the study of the human voice and when he discovered the  across the river at  he learned the  and translated its unwritten vocabulary into Visible Speech symbols</span>
				<span class='text'>For his work Bell was awarded the title of Honorary Chief and participated in a ceremony where he donned a  headdress and danced traditional dances</span>
				<span class='text'>fter setting up his workshop Bell continued experiments based on Helmholtzs work with electricity and sound</span>
				<span class='text'> He also modified a  a type of pump organ so that it could transmit its music electrically over a distance</span>
				<span class='text'>name Waldi undated  Once the family was settled in both Bell and his father made plans to establish a teaching practice and in 1871 he accompanied his father to Montreal where Melville was offered a position to teach his System of Visible Speech</span>
				<span class='text'>ork with the deafBells father was invited by Sarah Fuller principal of the Boston School for Deaf Mutes which continues today as the public  in Boston Massachusetts to introduce the Visible Speech System by providing training for Fullers instructors but he declined the post in favor of his son</span>
				<span class='text'>Traveling to Boston in April 1871 Bell proved successful in training the schools instructors</span>
				<span class='text'>He was subsequently asked to repeat the program at the  in  and the  in </span>
				<span class='text'>eturning home to Brantford after six months abroad Bell continued his experiments with his harmonic telegraph</span>
				<span class='text'>  The basic concept behind his device was that messages could be sent through a single wire if each message was transmitted at a different pitch but work on both the transmitter and receiver was needed</span>
				<span class='text'>nsure of his future he first contemplated returning to London to complete his studies but decided to return to Boston as a teacher</span>
				<span class='text'> His father helped him set up his private practice by contacting  the president of the Clarke School for the Deaf for a recommendation</span>
				<span class='text'>Teaching his fathers system in October 1872 Alexander Bell opened his School of Vocal Physiology and Mechanics of Speech in Boston which attracted a large number of deaf pupils with his first class numbering 30 students</span>
				<span class='text'> While he was working as a private tutor one of his most famous pupils was  who came to him as a young child unable to see hear or speak</span>

				<span class='text'>name Schoenherr2005  Several influential people of the time including Bell viewed deafness as something that should be eradicated and also believed that with resources and effort they could teach the deaf to speak and avoid the use of  thus enabling their integration within the wider society from which many were often being excluded</span>
				<span class='text'> In several schools children were mistreated for example by having their hands tied behind their backs so they could not communicate by signing—the only language they knew—in an attempt to force them to attempt oral communication</span>
				<span class='text'>Owing to his efforts to suppress the teaching of sign language Bell is often viewed negatively by those embracing </span>
				<span class='text'>Continuing experimentation  Linked from infobox at start of article  In the following year Bell became professor of Vocal Physiology and Elocution at the  School of Oratory</span>
				<span class='text'>During this period he alternated between Boston and Brantford spending summers in his Canadian home</span>
				<span class='text'>At Boston University Bell was swept up by the excitement engendered by the many scientists and inventors residing in the city</span>
				<span class='text'>He continued his research in sound and endeavored to find a way to transmit musical notes and articulate speech but although absorbed by his experiments he found it difficult to devote enough time to experimentation</span>
				<span class='text'>While days and evenings were occupied by his teaching and private classes Bell began to stay awake late into the night running experiment after experiment in rented facilities at his boarding house</span>
				<span class='text'>Keeping night owl hours he worried that his work would be discovered and took great pains to lock up his notebooks and laboratory equipment</span>
				<span class='text'>Bell had a specially made table where he could place his notes and equipment inside a locking cover</span>
				<span class='text'>Worse still his health deteriorated as he suffered severe headaches</span>
				<span class='text'>Returning to Boston in fall 1873 Bell made a fateful decision to concentrate on his experiments in sound</span>
				<span class='text'>eciding to give up his lucrative private Boston practice Bell retained only two students six year old Georgie Sanders deaf from birth and 15 year old </span>
				<span class='text'>Each pupil would play an important role in the next developments</span>
				<span class='text'>Georges father Thomas Sanders a wealthy businessman offered Bell a place to stay in nearby  with Georgies grandmother complete with a room to experiment</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the offer was made by Georges mother and followed the year long arrangement in 1872 where her son and his nurse had moved to quarters next to Bells boarding house it was clear that Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Sanders was backing the proposal</span>
				<span class='text'>The arrangement was for teacher and student to continue their work together with free room and board thrown in</span>
				<span class='text'>Mabel was a bright attractive girl who was ten years Bells junior but became the object of his affection</span>
				<span class='text'>Having lost her hearing after a near fatal bout of  close to her fifth birthday   she had learned to  but her father  Bells benefactor and personal friend wanted her to work directly with her teacher</span>

				<span class='text'>      Linked from infobox above  By 1874 Bells initial work on the harmonic telegraph had entered a formative stage with progress made both at his new Boston laboratory a rented facility and at his family home in Canada a big success</span>
				<span class='text'>While working that summer in Brantford Bell experimented with a  a pen like machine that could draw shapes of sound waves on smoked glass by tracing their vibrations</span>
				<span class='text'>Bell thought it might be possible to generate undulating electrical currents that corresponded to sound waves</span>
				<span class='text'> Bell also thought that multiple metal reeds tuned to different frequencies like a harp would be able to convert the undulating currents back into sound</span>
				<span class='text'>But he had no working model to demonstrate the feasibility of these ideas</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1874 telegraph message traffic was rapidly expanding and in the words of  President  had become the nervous system of commerce</span>
				<span class='text'>Orton had contracted with inventors  and  to find a way to send multiple telegraph messages on each telegraph line to avoid the great cost of constructing new lines</span>
				<span class='text'> When Bell mentioned to Gardiner Hubbard and Thomas Sanders that he was working on a method of sending multiple tones on a telegraph wire using a multi reed device the two wealthy patrons began to financially support Bells experiments</span>
				<span class='text'>Patent matters would be handled by Hubbards  </span>
				<span class='text'>In March 1875 Bell and Pollok visited the famous scientist  who was then director of the  and asked Henrys advice on the electrical multi reed apparatus that Bell hoped would transmit the human voice by telegraph</span>
				<span class='text'>Henry replied that Bell had the germ of a great invention</span>
				<span class='text'>When Bell said that he did not have the necessary knowledge Henry replied Get it That declaration greatly encouraged Bell to keep trying even though he did not have the equipment needed to continue his experiments nor the ability to create a working model of his ideas</span>
				<span class='text'>However a chance meeting in 1874 between Bell and  an experienced electrical designer and mechanic at the electrical machine shop of Charles Williams changed all that</span>
				<span class='text'>ith financial support from Sanders and Hubbard Bell hired Thomas Watson as his assistant and the two of them experimented with </span>
				<span class='text'>On June 2 1875 Watson accidentally plucked one of the reeds and Bell at the receiving end of the wire heard the overtones of the reed overtones that would be necessary for transmitting speech</span>
				<span class='text'>That demonstrated to Bell that only one reed or armature was necessary not multiple reeds</span>
				<span class='text'>This led to the gallows  which could transmit indistinct voice like sounds but not clear speech</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1875 Bell developed an  and drew up a  for it</span>
				<span class='text'>Since he had agreed to share U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>profits with his investors Gardiner Hubbard and Thomas Sanders Bell requested that an associate in Ontario  attempt to patent it in Britain instructing his lawyers to apply for a patent in the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>only after they received word from Britain Britain would issue patents only for discoveries not previously patented elsewhere</span>
				<span class='text'> not in the right article  belongs in the Gray and Bell controversy   NPOV involved     Meanwhile  was also experimenting with acoustic telegraphy and thought of a way to transmit speech using a water transmitter</span>
				<span class='text'>On February 14 1876 Gray filed a  with the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Patent Office for a telephone design that used a water transmitter</span>
				<span class='text'>That same morning Bells lawyer filed Bells application with the patent office</span>
				<span class='text'>There is considerable debate about who arrived first and Gray later challenged the primacy of Bells patent</span>
				<span class='text'>Bell was in Boston on February 14 and did not arrive in Washington until February 26</span>
				<span class='text'>ells patent 174465 was issued to Bell on March 7 1876 by the </span>
				<span class='text'>Bells patent covered the method of and apparatus for transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>by causing electrical undulations similar in form to the vibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sound  Bell returned to Boston the same day and the next day resumed work drawing in his notebook a diagram similar to that in Grays patent caveat</span>
				<span class='text'>n March 10 1876 three days after his patent was issued Bell succeeded in getting his telephone to work using a liquid transmitter similar to Grays design</span>
				<span class='text'>Vibration of the diaphragm caused a needle to vibrate in the water varying the  in the circuit</span>
				<span class='text'>When Bell spoke the famous sentence Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Watson—Come here—I want to see you into the liquid transmitter  Watson listening at the receiving end in an adjoining room heard the words clearly</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough Bell was and still is accused of stealing the telephone from Gray Bell used Grays water transmitter design only after Bells patent had been granted and only as a  scientific experiment to prove to his own satisfaction that intelligible articulate speech Bells words could be electrically transmitted</span>
				<span class='text'>After March 1876 Bell focused on improving the electromagnetic telephone and never used Grays liquid transmitter in public demonstrations or commercial use</span>
				<span class='text'>he question of priority for the variable resistance feature of the telephone was raised by the examiner before he approved Bells patent application</span>
				<span class='text'>He told Bell that his claim for the variable resistance feature was also described in Grays caveat</span>
				<span class='text'>Bell pointed to a variable resistance device in Bells previous application in which Bell described a cup of mercury not water</span>
				<span class='text'>Bell had filed the mercury application at the patent office a year earlier on February 25 1875 long before Elisha Gray described the water device</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition Gray abandoned his caveat and because he did not contest Bells priority the examiner approved Bells patent on March 3 1876</span>
				<span class='text'>Gray had reinvented the variable resistance telephone but Bell was the first to write down the idea and the first to test it in a telephone</span>
				<span class='text'>he  Zenas Fisk Wilber later stated in an  that he was an alcoholic who was much in debt to Bells lawyer  with whom he had served in the Civil War</span>
				<span class='text'>He claimed he showed Grays patent caveat to Bailey</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilber also claimed after Bell arrived in Washington D</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>from Boston that he showed Grays caveat to Bell and that Bell paid him 100</span>
				<span class='text'>Bell claimed they discussed the patent only in general terms although in a letter to Gray Bell admitted that he learned some of the technical details</span>
				<span class='text'>Bell denied in an affidavit that he ever gave Wilber any money</span>
				<span class='text'>Continuing his experiments in Brantford Bell brought home a working model of his telephone</span>
				<span class='text'>On August 3 1876 from the telegraph office in  five miles eightampnbspkm away from Brantford Bell sent a tentative telegram indicating that he was ready</span>
				<span class='text'>With curious onlookers packed into the office as witnesses faint voices were heard replying</span>
				<span class='text'>The following night he amazed guests as well as his family when a message was received at the Bell home from Brantford four miles six km distant along an improvised wire strung up along telegraph lines and fences and laid through a tunnel</span>
				<span class='text'>This time guests at the household distinctly heard people in Brantford reading and singing</span>
				<span class='text'>These experiments clearly proved that the telephone could work over long distances</span>
				<span class='text'>ell and his partners Hubbard and Sanders offered to sell the patent outright to Western Union for 100000</span>
				<span class='text'>The president of Western Union balked countering that the telephone was nothing but a toy</span>
				<span class='text'>Two years later he told colleagues that if he could get the patent for 25ampnbspmillion he would consider it a bargain</span>
				<span class='text'>By then the Bell company no longer wanted to sell the patent</span>
				<span class='text'> Bells investors would become millionaires while he fared well from residuals and at one point had assets of nearly one million dollars</span>
				<span class='text'>Bell began a series of public demonstrations and lectures to introduce the new invention to the  as well as the general public</span>
				<span class='text'>A short time later  at the 1876  in  brought the telephone to international attention</span>
				<span class='text'> Influential visitors to the exhibition included Emperor </span>
				<span class='text'>Later Bell had the opportunity to demonstrate the invention personally to  later Lord Kelvin a renowned Scottish scientist as well as to  who had requested a private audience at  her  home</span>
				<span class='text'>She called the demonstration most extraordinary</span>
				<span class='text'>The enthusiasm surrounding Bells public displays laid the groundwork for universal acceptance of the revolutionary device</span>
				<span class='text'>The  was created in 1877 and by 1886 more than 150000 people in the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>owned telephones</span>
				<span class='text'>Bell Company engineers made numerous other improvements to the telephone which emerged as one of the most successful products ever</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1879 the Bell company acquired Edisons patents for the  from Western Union</span>
				<span class='text'>This made the telephone practical for longer distances and it was no longer necessary to shout to be heard at the receiving telephone</span>
				<span class='text'>n January 1915 Bell made the first ceremonial transcontinental </span>
				<span class='text'>Calling from the  head office at 15 Dey Street in New York City Bell was heard by  at 333 Grant Avenue in San Francisco</span>

				<span class='text'>Over a period of 18 years the Bell Telephone Company faced 587 court challenges to its patents including five that went to the  name ATCS  but none was successful in establishing priority over the original Bell patent  and the Bell Telephone Company never lost a case that had proceeded to a final trial stage</span>
				<span class='text'>Bells laboratory notes and family letters were the key to establishing a long lineage to his experiments</span>
				<span class='text'>The Bell company lawyers successfully fought off myriad lawsuits generated initially around the challenges by Elisha Gray and </span>
				<span class='text'>In personal correspondence to Bell both Gray and Dolbear had acknowledged his prior work which considerably weakened their later claims</span>
				<span class='text'>n January 13 1887 the US</span>
				<span class='text'>Government moved to annul the patent issued to Bell on the grounds of fraud and misrepresentation</span>
				<span class='text'>After a series of decisions and reversals the Bell company won a decision in the Supreme Court though a couple of the original claims from the lower court cases were left undecided</span>

				<span class='text'>During a deposition filed for the 1887 trial Italian inventor  also claimed to have created the first working model of a telephone in Italy in 1834</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1886 in the first of three cases in which he was involved Meucci took the stand as a witness in the hopes of establishing his inventions priority</span>
				<span class='text'>Meuccis evidence in this case was disputed due to a lack of material evidence for his inventions as his working models were purportedly lost at the laboratory of  ADT of New York which was later incorporated as a subsidiary of Western Union in 1901</span>

				<span class='text'>   Some modern scholars do not agree with the claims that Bells work on the telephone was influenced by Meuccis inventions</span>
				<span class='text'>name Bellis The value of the Bell patent was acknowledged throughout the world and patent applications were made in most major countries but when Bell had delayed the German patent application the electrical firm of  managed to set up a rival manufacturer of Bell telephones under their own patent</span>
				<span class='text'>The Siemens company produced near identical copies of the Bell telephone without having to pay royalties</span>
				<span class='text'>The establishment of the  in Brussels Belgium in 1880 as well as a series of agreements in other countries eventually consolidated a global telephone operation</span>
				<span class='text'>The strain put on Bell by his constant appearances in court necessitated by the legal battles eventually resulted in his resignation from the company</span>
				<span class='text'>Family lifeOn July 11 1877 a few days after the  was established Bell married  1857–1923 at the Hubbard estate in </span>
				<span class='text'>His wedding present to his bride was to turn over 1487 of his 1497 shares in the newly formed Bell Telephone Company</span>
				<span class='text'>Shortly thereafter the newlyweds embarked on a year long honeymoon in Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>During that excursion Bell took a handmade model of his telephone with him making it a working holiday</span>
				<span class='text'>The courtship had begun years earlier however Bell waited until he was more financially secure before marrying</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the telephone appeared to be an instant success it was not initially a profitable venture and Bells main sources of income were from lectures until after 1897</span>
				<span class='text'>One unusual request exacted by his fiancée was that he use Alec rather than the familys earlier familiar name of Aleck</span>
				<span class='text'>From 1876 he would sign his name Alec Bell</span>
				<span class='text'> They had four children  Elsie May Bell 1878–1964 who married  of  fame</span>

				<span class='text'>Married </span>
				<span class='text'>   Two sons who died in infancy Edward in 1881 and Robert in 1883</span>
				<span class='text'>The Bell family home was in Cambridge Massachusetts until 1880 when Bells father in law bought a house in Washington D</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>and later in 1882 bought a home in the same city for Bells family so that they could be with him while he attended to the numerous court cases involving patent disputes</span>
				<span class='text'>ell was a  throughout his early life in Scotland and later in Canada until 1882 when he became a  of the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1915 he characterized his status as I am not one of those hyphenated Americans who claim allegiance to two countries</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite this declaration Bell has been proudly claimed as a native son by all three countries he resided in the United States Canada and the United Kingdom   Bell also lived in London so UK is more appropriate than Scotland   </span>

				<span class='text'>That summer the Bells had a vacation on  in Nova Scotia spending time at the small village of </span>
				<span class='text'> Returning in 1886 Bell started building an estate on a point across from Baddeck overlooking </span>
				<span class='text'>By 1889 a large house christened The Lodge was completed and two years later a larger complex of buildings including a new laboratory were begun that the Bells would name  Gaelic beautiful mountain after Bells ancestral </span>
				<span class='text'> Bell also built the  on the estate employing up to 40 people building experimental craft as well as wartime lifeboats and workboats for the  and pleasure craft for the Bell family</span>
				<span class='text'>An enthusiastic boater Bell and his family sailed a rowed a long series of vessels on Bras dOr Lake ordering additional vessels from the  boatyard in </span>
				<span class='text'>In his final and some of his most productive years Bell split his residency between Washington D</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>where he and his family initially resided for most of the year and at Beinn Bhreagh where they spent increasing amounts of time</span>
				<span class='text'>ntil the end of his life Bell and his family would alternate between the two homes but Beinn Bhreagh would over the next 30 years become more than a summer home as Bell became so absorbed in his experiments that his annual stays lengthened</span>
				<span class='text'>Both Mabel and Bell became immersed in the Baddeck community and were accepted by the villagers as their own</span>
				<span class='text'>The Bells were still in residence at Beinn Bhreagh when the  occurred on December 6 1917</span>
				<span class='text'>Mabel and Bell mobilized the community to help victims in Halifax</span>
				<span class='text'>ater inventionsAlthough Alexander Graham Bell is most often associated with the invention of the telephone his interests were extremely varied</span>
				<span class='text'>According to one of his biographers  Bells work ranged unfettered across the scientific landscape and he often went to bed voraciously reading the Encyclopædia Britannica scouring it for new areas of interest</span>
				<span class='text'>The range of Bells inventive genius is represented only in part by the 18 patents granted in his name alone and the 12 he shared with his collaborators</span>
				<span class='text'>These included 14 for the telephone and telegraph four for the  one for the  five for aerial vehicles four for hydroairplanes and two for  cells</span>
				<span class='text'>Bells inventions spanned a wide range of interests and included a metal jacket to assist in breathing the  to detect minor hearing problems a device to locate icebergs investigations on how to separate salt from seawater and work on finding s</span>
				<span class='text'>ell worked extensively in  and invented techniques for teaching speech to the deaf</span>
				<span class='text'>During his  period Bell and his associates considered impressing a  on a record as a means of reproducing sound</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the trio briefly experimented with the concept they could not develop a workable prototype</span>
				<span class='text'>They abandoned the idea never realizing they had glimpsed a basic principle which would one day find its application in the  the  and  drive and other </span>
				<span class='text'>ells own home used a primitive form of air conditioning in which fans blew currents of air across great blocks of ice</span>
				<span class='text'>He also anticipated modern concerns with fuel shortages and industrial pollution</span>
				<span class='text'> gas he reasoned could be produced from the waste of farms and factories</span>
				<span class='text'>At his Canadian estate in Nova Scotia he experimented with s and devices to capture water from the atmosphere</span>
				<span class='text'>In a magazine interview published shortly before his death he lected on the possibility of using  to heat houses</span>
				<span class='text'>ell and his assistant  jointly invented a wireless telephone named a  which allowed for the transmission of both sounds and normal human conversations on a beam of </span>
				<span class='text'>name SDU  Both men later became full associates in the </span>
				<span class='text'>n June 21 1880 Bells assistant transmitted a wireless voice telephone message a considerable distance from the roof of the  in Washington D</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>to Bell at the window of his laboratory some  away 19 years before the first voice radio transmissions</span>
				<span class='text'> Bell believed the photophones principles were his lifes greatest achievement telling a reporter shortly before his death that the photophone was the greatest invention I have ever made greater than the telephone</span>
				<span class='text'> The photophone was a precursor to the  systems which achieved popular worldwide usage in the 1980s</span>
				<span class='text'> name AmericanScientist 1984</span>
				<span class='text'>72</span>
				<span class='text'>o1  Its master patent was issued in December 1880 many decades before the photophones principles came into popular use</span>
				<span class='text'>ell is also credited with developing one of the early versions of a  in 1881</span>
				<span class='text'>The device was quickly put together in an attempt to find the bullet in the body of U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>President </span>
				<span class='text'>According to some accounts the metal detector worked flawlessly in tests but did not find the assassins bullet partly because the metal bed frame on which the President was lying disturbed the instrument resulting in static</span>
				<span class='text'> The presidents surgeons who were skeptical of the device ignored Bells requests to move the president to a bed not fitted with metal springs</span>
				<span class='text'>Alternatively although Bell had detected a slight sound on his first test the bullet may have been lodged too deeply to be detected by the crude apparatus</span>
				<span class='text'>ells own detailed account presented to the  in 1882 differs in several particulars from most of the many and varied versions now in circulation most notably by concluding that extraneous metal was not to blame for failure to locate the bullet</span>
				<span class='text'>Perplexed by the peculiar results he had obtained during an examination of Garfield Bell </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>roceeded to the Executive Mansion the next morning</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>o ascertain from the surgeons whether they were perfectly sure that all metal had been removed from the neighborhood of the bed</span>
				<span class='text'>It was then recollected that underneath the horse hair mattress on which the President lay was another mattress composed of steel wires</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon obtaining a duplicate the mattress was found to consist of a sort of net of woven steel wires with large meshes</span>
				<span class='text'>The extent of the area that produced a response from the detector having been so small as compared with the area of the bed it seemed reasonable to conclude that the steel mattress had produced no detrimental effect</span>
				<span class='text'>In a footnote Bell adds that The death of President Garfield and the subsequent post mortem examination however proved that the bullet was at too great a distance from the surface to have affected our apparatus</span>
				<span class='text'>The March 1906  article by American pioneer William E</span>
				<span class='text'>Meacham explained the basic principle of s and </span>
				<span class='text'>Bell considered the invention of the hydroplane as a very significant achievement</span>
				<span class='text'>Based on information gained from that article he began to sketch concepts of what is now called a hydrofoil boat</span>
				<span class='text'>Bell and assistant  began hydrofoil experimentation in the summer of 1908 as a possible aid to airplane takeoff from water</span>
				<span class='text'>Baldwin studied the work of the Italian inventor  and began testing models</span>
				<span class='text'>This led him and Bell to the development of practical hydrofoil watercraft</span>
				<span class='text'>uring his world tour of 1910–11 Bell and Baldwin met with Forlanini in France</span>
				<span class='text'>They had rides in the Forlanini hydrofoil boat over </span>
				<span class='text'>Baldwin described it as being as smooth as flying</span>
				<span class='text'>On returning to Baddeck a number of initial concepts were built as experimental models including the Dhonnas Beag the first self propelled Bell Baldwin hydrofoil</span>
				<span class='text'>The experimental boats were essentially proof of concept prototypes that culminated in the more substantial  powered by  engines</span>
				<span class='text'>A top speed of  was achieved with the hydrofoil exhibiting rapid acceleration good stability and steering along with the ability to take waves without difficulty</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1913 Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Bell hired Walter Pinaud a Sydney yacht designer and builder as well as the proprietor of Pinauds Yacht Yard in  to work on the pontoons of the HD 4</span>
				<span class='text'>Pinaud soon took over the boatyard at Bell Laboratories on Beinn Bhreagh Bells estate near </span>
				<span class='text'>Pinauds experience in boat building enabled him to make useful design changes to the HD 4</span>
				<span class='text'>After the First World War work began again on the HD 4</span>
				<span class='text'>Bells report to the  permitted him to obtain two  engines in July 1919</span>
				<span class='text'>On September 9 1919 the HD 4 set a world marine speed record of  a record which stood for ten years</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1891 Bell had begun experiments to develop motor powered heavier than air aircraft</span>
				<span class='text'>The AEA was first formed as Bell shared the vision to fly with his wife who advised him to seek young help as Bell was at the age of 60</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1898 Bell experimented with  s and wings constructed of multiple compound s covered in maroon silk</span>
				<span class='text'>The tetrahedral wings were named Cygnet I II and III and were flown both unmanned and manned Cygnet I crashed during a flight carrying Selfridge in the period from 1907–1912</span>
