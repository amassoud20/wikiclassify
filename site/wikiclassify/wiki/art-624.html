				<span class='text'>]''[[The Master and Margarita]]'' (–ú–∞—Å—Ç–µ—Ä –∏ –ú–∞—Ä–≥–∞—Ä–∏—Ç–∞), which Bulgakov began writing in 1928 and which was finally published by his widow in 1966, twenty-six years after his death, led to an international appreciation of his work</span>
				<span class='text'>The book contributed a number of sayings to the Russian language, for example, &quot;Manuscripts don't burn&quot; and &quot;second-grade freshness&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>A destroyed manuscript of the Master is an important element of the plot</span>

				<span class='text'>he novel is a critique of Soviet society and its literary establishment</span>
				<span class='text'>The work is appreciated for its philosophical undertones and for its high artistic level, thanks to its picturesque descriptions (especially of old Jerusalem), lyrical fragments and style</span>
				<span class='text'>It is a [[frame narrative]] involving two characteristically related time periods, or plot lines: a retelling of the gospels and a description of contemporary Moscow {{Citation needed|reason=Entire paragraph needs reliable source needed to back up the claims of literary merit|date=May 2014}}</span>
				<span class='text'>he novel begins with [[Satan]] visiting Moscow in the 1930s, joining a conversation between a critic and a poet debating the existence of [[Jesus Christ]] and the Devil</span>
				<span class='text'>It develops into an all-embracing indictment of the corruption, greed, narrow-mindedness, and widespread paranoia of Soviet Russia</span>
				<span class='text'>Published more than 25 years after Bulgakov's death, and more than ten years after Stalin's, the novel firmly secured Bulgakov's place among the pantheon of great Russian writers {{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for claim of &quot;Bulgakov's place among the pantheon of great Russian writers</span>
