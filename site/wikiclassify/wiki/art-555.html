				<span class='text'>He later said that he would easily give ten years from his life to be able to play the cello</span>
				<span class='text'> At an early age, he experienced a dramatic phase in which he converted to Catholicism, which only lasted a few years</span>
				<span class='text'> He started to embark on long journeys, some of them on foot</span>

				<span class='text'>During his last years of high school, no production company was willing to take on his projects, so Herzog worked night shifts as a welder in a steel factory to earn the funds for his first featurettes</span>
				<span class='text'> After graduating from high school, he was intrigued by the Congo after its independence, but only reached the south of the Sudan where he fell seriously ill</span>

				<span class='text'>Herzog's reservation was canceled due to a last-minute change in itinerary</span>
				<span class='text'>The plane was later struck by lightning and disintegrated, but one survivor lived after a free fall</span>
