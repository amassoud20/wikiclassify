				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Ptolemy was the author of several scientific treatises, three of which were of continuing importance to later [[Islamic science|Islamic]], [[Byzantium|Byzantine]] and [[Europe]]an science</span>
				<span class='text'>The first is the astronomical treatise now known as the ''[[Almagest]]'', although it was originally entitled the &quot;Mathematical Treatise&quot; ({{lang|grc|Μαθηματικὴ Σύνταξις}}, ''Mathēmatikē Syntaxis'') and then known as the &quot;Great Treatise&quot; ({{lang|grc|Ἡ Μεγάλη Σύνταξις}}, ''Ē Megálē Syntaxis'')</span>
				<span class='text'>The second is the ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'', which is a thorough discussion of the geographic knowledge of the [[Greco-Roman]] world</span>
				<span class='text'>This manuscript was used by [[Christopher Columbus]] as the map for his westward-bound path to [[Asia]], in which he discovered the hitherto unknown [[Western Hemisphere|lands of the Americas]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The third is the astrological treatise in which he attempted to adapt [[horoscopic astrology]] to the [[Aristotelian physics|Aristotelian]] [[natural philosophy]] of his day</span>
				<span class='text'>This is sometimes known as the ''[[Apotelesmatika]]'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀποτελεσματικά}}) but more commonly known as the ''[[Tetrabiblos]]'' from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ({{lang|grc|Τετράβιβλος}}) meaning &quot;Four Books&quot; or by the Latin ''[[Quadripartitum]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>lthough [[Abu Ma'shar al-Balkhi|Abu Ma'shar]] believed Ptolemy to be one of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]] who ruled Egypt after the conquest of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] the title ‘King Ptolemy’ is generally viewed as a mark of respect for Ptolemy's elevated standing in science</span>
				<span class='text'>]The name ''[[Claudius (gens)|Claudius]]'' is a Roman ''[[Roman naming conventions|nomen]]''; the fact that Ptolemy bore it indicates he lived under the Roman rule of Egypt with the privileges and political rights of [[Roman citizenship]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It would have suited custom if the first of Ptolemy's family to become a citizen (whether he or an ancestor) took the ''nomen'' from a Roman called Claudius who was responsible for granting citizenship</span>
				<span class='text'>If, as was common, this was the emperor, citizenship would have been granted between AD 41 and 68 (when [[Claudius]], and then [[Nero]], were emperors)</span>
				<span class='text'>The astronomer would also have had a ''[[Roman naming conventions|praenomen]]'', which remains unknown</span>
				<span class='text'>'[[Ptolemy (name)|Ptolemaeus]]'' (Πτολεμαῖος – ''Ptolemaios'') is a Greek name</span>

				<span class='text'>All the kings after him, until Egypt became a Roman province in 30 BC, were also [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]]</span>
				<span class='text'>erhaps for no other reason than the association of name, the 9th-century [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Islamic astronomy|astronomer]] [[Abu Ma'shar al-Balkhi|Abu Ma'shar]] assumed Ptolemy to be a member of Egypt's royal lineage, stating that the ten kings of Egypt who followed [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] were wise &quot;and included Ptolemy the Wise, who composed the book of the ''Almagest''&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Abu Ma'shar al-Balkhi|Abu Ma'shar]] recorded a belief that a different member of this royal line &quot;composed the book on astrology and attributed it to Ptolemy&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>We can evidence historical confusion on this point from [[Abu Ma'shar al-Balkhi|Abu Ma'shar's]] subsequent remark “It is sometimes said that the very learned man who wrote the book of astrology also wrote the book of the ''Almagest''</span>

				<span class='text'>Following Marinos, he assigned [[coordinate]]s to all the places and geographic features he knew, in a [[Grid (spatial index)|grid]] that spanned the globe</span>

				<span class='text'>In books 2 through 7, he used degrees and put the [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] of 0 [[longitude]] at the most western land he knew, the &quot;[[Fortunate Isles|Blessed Islands]]&quot;, often identified as the [[Canary Islands]], as suggested by the location of the six dots labelled the &quot;FORTUNATA&quot; islands near the left extreme of the blue sea of Ptolemy's map here reproduced</span>

				<span class='text'>In the second part of the ''Geography'', he provided the necessary [[topographic]] lists, and captions for the maps</span>
				<span class='text'>His ''oikoumenè'' spanned 180 degrees of longitude from the Blessed Islands in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the middle of [[China]], and about 80 degrees of latitude from [[Shetland]] to anti-Meroe (east coast of [[Africa]]); Ptolemy was well aware that he knew about only a quarter of the globe, and an erroneous extension of China southward suggests his sources did not reach all the way to the Pacific Ocean</span>
				<span class='text'>he maps in surviving manuscripts of Ptolemy's ''Geography'', however, only date from about 1300, after the text was rediscovered by [[Maximus Planudes]]</span>

				<span class='text'>An edition printed at [[Ulm]] in 1482, including woodcut maps, was the first one printed north of the [[Alps]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The maps look distorted when compared to modern maps, because Ptolemy's data were inaccurate</span>
				<span class='text'>One reason is that Ptolemy estimated the size of the Earth as too small: while [[Eratosthenes]] found 700 ''stadia'' for a great circle degree on the globe, Ptolemy uses 500 ''stadia'' in the ''Geography''</span>
				<span class='text'>It is highly probable that these were the same ''stadion'', since Ptolemy switched from the former scale to the latter between the ''Syntaxis'' and the ''Geography'', and severely readjusted longitude degrees accordingly</span>

				<span class='text'>ecause Ptolemy derived many of his key latitudes from crude longest day values, his latitudes are erroneous on average by roughly a degree (2 degrees for Byzantium, 4 degrees for Carthage), though capable ancient astronomers knew their latitudes to more like a minute</span>
				<span class='text'>(Ptolemy's own latitude was in error by 14'</span>
				<span class='text'> He agreed (''Geography'' 1</span>
				<span class='text'>) that longitude was best determined by simultaneous observation of lunar eclipses, yet he was so out of touch with the scientists of his day that he knew of no such data more recent than 500 years before (Arbela eclipse)</span>
				<span class='text'>When switching from 700 stadia per degree to 500, he (or Marinos) expanded longitude differences between cities accordingly (a point first realized by P</span>
				<span class='text'>osselin in 1790), resulting in serious over-stretching of the Earth's east-west scale in degrees, though not distance</span>
				<span class='text'>Achieving highly precise longitude remained a problem in geography until the application of [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]'s Jovian moon method in the 18th century</span>
				<span class='text'>It must be added that his original topographic list cannot be reconstructed: the long tables with numbers were transmitted to posterity through copies containing many scribal errors, and people have always been adding or improving the topographic data: this is a testimony to the persistent popularity of this influential work in the [[history of cartography]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; His astrological treatise, a work in four parts, is known by the Greek term ''[[Tetrabiblos]]'', or the Latin equivalent ''Quadripartitum'': ‘Four Books’</span>
				<span class='text'>Ptolemy's own title is unknown, but may have been the term found in some Greek manuscripts: ''Apotelesmatika'', roughly meaning 'Astrological Outcomes,' 'Effects' or ‘Prognostics’</span>

				<span class='text'>xii</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;As a source of reference, the ''Tetrabiblos'' is said to have &quot;enjoyed almost the authority of a Bible among the astrological writers of a thousand years or more&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>xii</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; It was first translated from Arabic into Latin by [[Plato of Tivoli]] (Tiburtinus) in 1138, while he was in Spain</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;FA Robbins, 1940; Thorndike 1923&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Tetrabiblos'' is an extensive and continually reprinted treatise on the ancient principles of [[horoscopic astrology]]</span>
				<span class='text'>That it did not quite attain the unrivaled status of the ''[[Almagest]]'' was, perhaps, because it did not cover some popular areas of the subject, particularly [[electional astrology]] (interpreting astrological charts for a particular moment to determine the outcome of a course of action to be initiated at that time), and [[medical astrology]], which were later adoptions</span>
				<span class='text'>he great popularity that the ''Tetrabiblos'' did possess might be attributed to its nature as an exposition of the art of astrology, and as a compendium of astrological lore, rather than as a manual</span>
				<span class='text'>It speaks in general terms, avoiding illustrations and details of practice</span>
				<span class='text'>Ptolemy was concerned to defend astrology by defining its limits, [[Ephemeris|compiling astronomical data]] that he believed was reliable and dismissing practices (such as considering the [[Numerology|numerological]] significance of names) that he believed to be without sound basis</span>
				<span class='text'>uch of the content of the ''Tetrabiblos'' was collected from earlier sources; Ptolemy's achievement was to order his material in a systematic way, showing how the subject could, in his view, be rationalized</span>
				<span class='text'>It is, indeed, presented as the second part of the study of astronomy of which the ''Almagest'' was the first, concerned with the influences of the celestial bodies in the [[Earth|sublunar]] sphere</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus explanations of a sort are provided for the astrological effects of the [[planets]], based upon their combined effects of heating, cooling, moistening, and drying</span>
				<span class='text'>tolemy's astrological outlook was quite practical: he thought that astrology was like [[medicine]], that is ''conjectural'', because of the many variable factors to be taken into account: the [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[country]], and [[nurture|upbringing]] of a person affects an individual's personality as much as, if not more than, the positions of the Sun, Moon, and planets at the precise moment of their birth, so Ptolemy saw astrology as something to be used in life but in no way relied on entirely</span>
				<span class='text'> collection of one hundred [[aphorism]]s about astrology called the ''[[Centiloquium]]'', ascribed to Ptolemy, was widely reproduced and commented on by Arabic, Latin and Hebrew scholars, and often bound together in medieval manuscripts after the ''Tetrabiblos'' as a kind of summation</span>
				<span class='text'>It is now believed to be a much later [[pseudepigraph]]ical composition</span>
				<span class='text'>The identity and date of the actual author of the work, referred to now as [[Pseudo-Ptolemy]], remains the subject of conjecture</span>
				<span class='text'>=Music==Ptolemy also wrote an influential work, ''Harmonics'', on [[music theory]] and the mathematics of music</span>
				<span class='text'>After criticizing the approaches of his predecessors, Ptolemy argued for basing musical intervals on mathematical ratios (in contrast to the followers of [[Aristoxenus]] and in agreement with the followers of [[Pythagoras]]), backed up by empirical observation (in contrast to the overly theoretical approach of the [[Pythagoreans]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Ptolemy wrote about how musical notes could be translated into mathematical equations and vice versa in ''Harmonics''</span>
				<span class='text'>This is called Pythagorean tuning because it was first discovered by Pythagoras</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Pythagoras believed that the mathematics of music should be based on the specific ratio of 3:2, whereas Ptolemy merely believed that it should just generally involve [[tetrachord]]s and [[octave]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>He presented his own divisions of the tetrachord and the octave, which he derived with the help of a [[monochord]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His ''Harmonics'' never had the influence of his ''Almagest'' or ''Planetary Hypotheses'', but a part of it (Book III) did encourage [[Kepler]] in his own musings on the harmony of the world (Kepler, ''Harmonice Mundi'', Appendix to Book V)</span>

				<span class='text'>Ptolemy combined the mathematical, philosophical and physiological traditions</span>
				<span class='text'>He held an extramission-intromission theory of vision: the rays (or flux) from the eye formed a cone, the vertex being within the eye, and the base defining the visual field</span>
				<span class='text'>The rays were sensitive, and conveyed information back to the observer’s intellect about the distance and orientation of surfaces</span>
				<span class='text'>Size and shape were determined by the visual angle subtended at the eye combined with perceived distance and orientation</span>
				<span class='text'>This was one of the early statements of size-distance invariance as a cause of perceptual size and shape constancy, a view supported by the Stoics</span>
