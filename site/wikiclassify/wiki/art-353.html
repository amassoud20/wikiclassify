				<span class='text'>vg}}'''Jean Louis Rodolphe Agassiz''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|ˈ|æ|g|ə|s|i}}) (May 28, 1807 – December 14, 1873) was a Swiss-born and European-trained [[biologist]] and [[geologist]] recognized as an innovative and prodigious scholar of Earth's [[natural history]], with later American writings that have received scrutiny because of particular racial themes</span>
				<span class='text'>Agassiz grew up in Switzerland, and studied and received Doctor of Philosophy and medical degrees at Erlangen and Munich, respectively</span>
				<span class='text'>After further studies with [[Georges Cuvier|Cuvier]] and [[Alexander von Humboldt|von Humboldt]] in Paris, Agassiz proceeded with research leading to his appointment as professor of [[natural history]] at [[University of Neuchâtel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>fter visiting [[Harvard University]] mid-career, he emigrated to the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>in 1847 and became a professor of zoology and geology at Harvard, and to head its [[Lawrence Scientific School]] and found its [[Museum of Comparative Zoology]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Agassiz made extensive contributions to [[ichthyology|ichthyological]] classification (including of extinct species) and to the study of [[geological history]] (including to the founding of  [[glaciology]]), and has become broadly known through study of his thorough regimen of observational data gathering and analysis</span>
				<span class='text'>He made vast institutional and scientific contributions to zoology, geology, and related areas—including many multi-volume research series running to thousands of pages</span>
				<span class='text'>evertheless, his reputation has suffered somewhat in hindsight by the evidence of his resistance to [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] [[evolution]], and his later writings on human [[polygenism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Early life=={{further|Agassiz family}}Louis Agassiz was born in Môtier (now part of [[Haut-Vully]]) in the [[canton of Fribourg]], Switzerland</span>
				<span class='text'>Educated first at home, then spending four years of secondary school in [[Bienne]], he completed his elementary studies in [[Lausanne]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Having adopted medicine as his profession, he studied successively at the universities of [[University of Zurich|Zürich]], [[Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]] and [[Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich|Munich]]; while there he extended his knowledge of [[natural history]], especially of [[botany]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1829 he received the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at [[Friedrich-Alexander-University, Erlangen-Nuremberg|Erlangen]], and in 1830 that of [[doctor of medicine]] at Munich</span>
				<span class='text'>Moving to Paris he came under the tutelage of [[Alexander von Humboldt]] (and later his financial benevolence)&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Wulf, ''The Invention of Nature: Alexander von Humboldt's New World''</span>
				<span class='text'>New York: Alfred A</span>
				<span class='text'>Knopf 2015, p</span>
				<span class='text'>250&lt;/ref&gt; Humboldt and [[Georges Cuvier]] launched him on his careers of geology and zoology respectively</span>
				<span class='text'>Previously he had not paid special attention to the study of [[ichthyology]], but it soon became the focus of his life's work</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|left|thumb|Agassiz in 1870]]In 1819–1820, [[Johann Baptist von Spix]] and [[Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius]] were engaged in an expedition to [[Brazil]], and on their return to Europe, amongst other collections of natural objects they brought home an important set of the [[Freshwater fish|fresh water fish]] of [[Brazil]], and especially of the [[Amazon river#Fish|Amazon River]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Spix, who died in 1826, did not live long enough to work out the history of these fish, and Agassiz (though fresh out of school) was selected by Martius for this purpose</span>
				<span class='text'>He at once threw himself into the work with an enthusiasm which characterized him to the end of his busy life</span>
				<span class='text'>The task of describing the Brazilian fish was completed and published in 1829</span>
				<span class='text'>This was followed by research into the history of the fish found in [[Lake Neuchâtel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Enlarging his plans, in 1830 he issued a prospectus of a ''History of the Freshwater Fish of Central Europe''</span>
				<span class='text'>It was only in 1839, however, that the first part of this publication appeared, and it was completed in 1842</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1832 he was appointed professor of natural history in the [[University of Neuchâtel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[fossil fish]] there soon attracted his attention</span>
				<span class='text'>The fossil-rich stones furnished by the [[slate]]s of [[Glarus]] and the [[limestone]]s of Monte [[Bolca]] were known at the time, but very little had been accomplished in the way of scientific study of them</span>
				<span class='text'>Agassiz, as early as 1829, planned the publication of the work which, more than any other, laid the foundation of his worldwide fame</span>
				<span class='text'>Five volumes of his ''Recherches sur les poissons fossiles'' (&quot;Research on Fossil Fish&quot;) appeared at intervals from 1833 to 1843</span>
				<span class='text'>They were magnificently illustrated, chiefly by Joseph Dinkel</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www</span>

				<span class='text'>They had known him for seven years at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Louis Aggasiz and Benjamin Peirce</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright=1</span>
				<span class='text'>|With [[Benjamin Peirce]] ]]Agassiz found that his palaeontological labors made necessary a new basis of ichthyological classification</span>
				<span class='text'>The fossils rarely exhibited any traces of the soft tissues of fish</span>
				<span class='text'>They consisted chiefly of the teeth, scales and fins, even the bones being perfectly preserved in comparatively few instances</span>
				<span class='text'>He therefore adopted a classification which divided fish into four groups: Ganoids, Placoids, Cycloids and Ctenoids, based on the nature of the scales and other dermal appendages</span>
				<span class='text'>While Agassiz did much to place the subject on a scientific basis, this classification has been superseded by later work</span>
				<span class='text'>s Agassiz's descriptive work proceeded, it became obvious that it would over-tax his resources unless financial assistance could be found</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[British Association for the Advancement of Science|British Association]] came to his aid, and the [[Earl of Ellesmere]]—then [[Francis Egerton, 1st Earl of Ellesmere|Lord Francis Egerton]]—gave him yet more efficient help</span>
				<span class='text'>The 1,290 original drawings made for the work were purchased by the Earl, and presented by him to the [[Geological Society of London]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1836 the [[Wollaston Medal]] was awarded to Agassiz by the council of that society for his work on fossil ichthyology; and in 1838 he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Society]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Meanwhile, [[invertebrate]] animals engaged his attention</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1837 he issued the &quot;Prodrome&quot; of a monograph on the recent and fossil [[Echinodermata]], the first part of which appeared in 1838; in 1839–40 he published two quarto volumes on the fossil Echinoderms of Switzerland; and in 1840–45 he issued his ''Etudes critiques sur les mollusques fossiles'' (&quot;Critical Studies on Fossil [[Mollusk]]s&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>efore his first visit to England in 1834, the labours of [[Hugh Miller]] and other geologists brought to light the remarkable fish of the [[Old Red Sandstone]] of the northeast of Scotland</span>
				<span class='text'>The strange forms of the ''[[Pterichthys]]'', the ''[[Coccosteus]]'' and other genera were then made known to geologists for the first time</span>
				<span class='text'>They were of intense interest to Agassiz, and formed the subject of a special monograph by him published in 1844–45: ''Monographie des poissons fossiles du Vieux Gres Rouge, ou Systeme Devonien (Old Red Sandstone) des Iles Britanniques et de Russie'' (&quot;Monograph on Fossil Fish of the Old Red Sandstone, or Devonian System of the British Isles and of Russia&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>In the early stages of his career in Neuchatel, Agassiz also made a name for himself as a man who could run a scientific department well</span>
				<span class='text'>Under his care, the University of Neuchâtel soon became a leading institution for scientific inquiry</span>

				<span class='text'>She was a paleontologist who was known around the world for important finds, but because of her gender, usually omitted from formal recognition for her work</span>
				<span class='text'>In the early 1840s he named two fossil fish species after her—''[[Acrodus anningiae]]'', and ''Belenostomus anningiae''—and another after her friend, [[Elizabeth Philpot]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Agassiz was grateful for the help the women had given him in examining fossil fish specimens during his visit to Lyme Regis in 1834</span>

				<span class='text'>The question having attracted the attention of Agassiz, he not only discussed it with Charpentier and Schimper and made successive journeys to the alpine regions in company with them, but he had a hut constructed upon one of the [[Aar Glaciers]], which for a time he made his home, in order to investigate the structure and movements of the ice</span>
				<span class='text'>hese labours resulted, in 1840, in the publication of his work in two volumes entitled ''Etudes sur les glaciers'' (&quot;Studies on Glaciers&quot;)</span>

				<span class='text'>Accessed on February 25, 2008</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In it he discussed the movements of the glaciers, their [[moraine]]s, their influence in grooving and rounding the rocks over which they travelled, and in producing the striations and ''roches moutonnees'' seen in Alpine-style landscapes</span>
				<span class='text'>He not only accepted Charpentier's and Schimper's idea that some of the alpine glaciers had extended across the wide plains and valleys drained by the [[Aar]] and the [[Rhône]], but he went still farther</span>
				<span class='text'>He concluded that, in the relatively recent past, Switzerland had been another [[Greenland]]; that instead of a few glaciers stretching across the areas referred to, one vast sheet of ice, originating in the higher Alps, had extended over the entire valley of northwestern Switzerland until it reached the southern slopes of the Jura, which, though they checked and deflected its further extension, did not prevent the ice from reaching in many places the summit of the range</span>
				<span class='text'>The publication of this work gave a fresh impetus to the study of glacial phenomena in all parts of the world</span>
				<span class='text'>hus familiarized with the phenomena associated with the movements of recent glaciers, Agassiz was prepared for a discovery which he made in 1840, in conjunction with [[William Buckland]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The two visited the mountains of Scotland together, and found in different locations clear evidence of ancient glacial action</span>
				<span class='text'>The discovery was announced to the Geological Society of London in successive communications</span>
				<span class='text'>The mountainous districts of England, Wales, and Ireland were also considered to constitute centres for the dispersion of glacial debris; and Agassiz remarked &quot;that great sheets of ice, resembling those now existing in Greenland, once covered all the countries in which unstratified gravel (boulder drift) is found; that this gravel was in general produced by the trituration of the sheets of ice upon the subjacent surface, etc</span>

				<span class='text'>During his tenure at Harvard, he was, among many other things, an early student of the effect of the last Ice Age on North America</span>
				<span class='text'>e continued his lectures for the Lowell Institute</span>
				<span class='text'>In succeeding years, he gave series of lectures on &quot;Ichthyology&quot; (1847–48 season), &quot;Comparative Embryology&quot; (1848–49), &quot;Functions of Life in Lower Animals&quot; (1850–51), &quot;Natural History&quot; (1853–54), &quot;Methods of Study in Natural History&quot; (1861–62), &quot;Glaciers and the Ice Period&quot; (1864–65), &quot;Brazil&quot; (1866–67) and &quot;Deep Sea [[Marine biology dredge|Dredging]]&quot; (1869–70)</span>

				<span class='text'>From this time his scientific studies dropped off, but he was a profound influence on the American branches of his two fields, teaching decades worth of future prominent scientists, including [[Alpheus Hyatt]], [[David Starr Jordan]], [[Joel Asaph Allen]], [[Joseph Le Conte]], [[Ernest Ingersoll]], [[William James]], [[Nathaniel Shaler]], [[Samuel Hubbard Scudder]], [[Alpheus Packard]], and his son [[Alexander Emanuel Agassiz]], among others</span>
				<span class='text'>He had a profound impact on paleontologist [[Charles Doolittle Walcott]] and natural scientist [[Edward S</span>

				<span class='text'> In return his name appears attached to several species, as well as here and there throughout the American landscape, notably [[Lake Agassiz]], the [[Pleistocene]] precursor to [[Lake Winnipeg]] and the [[Red River of the North|Red River]], and [[Mount Agassiz (California)|Mount Agassiz]], a bastion of the [[Palisades (California Sierra)|Palisade Crest]], the largest glaciated region of California's [[Sierra Nevada (U</span>

				<span class='text'>uring this time he grew in fame even in the public consciousness, becoming one of the best-known scientists in the world</span>
				<span class='text'>By 1857 he was so well-loved that his friend [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] wrote &quot;The fiftieth birthday of Agassiz&quot; in his honor</span>
				<span class='text'>His own writing continued with four (of a planned ten) volumes of ''Natural History of the United States'' which were published from 1857 to 1862</span>
				<span class='text'>During this time he also published a catalog of papers in his field, ''Bibliographia Zoologiae et Geologiae'', in four volumes between 1848 and 1854</span>
				<span class='text'>tricken by ill health in the 1860s, he resolved to return to the field  for relaxation and to resume his studies of Brazilian fish</span>
				<span class='text'>In April 1865 he led a party to Brazil</span>
				<span class='text'>Returning home in August 1866, an account of this expedition, entitled ''A Journey in Brazil'', was published in 1868</span>
				<span class='text'>In December 1871 he made a second eight-month excursion, known as the [[Hassler (vessel)|''Hassler'']] expedition under the command of Commander Philip Carrigan Johnson (brother of [[Eastman Johnson]]), visiting South America on its southern Atlantic and Pacific seaboards</span>
				<span class='text'> The ship explored the [[Magellan Strait]], which drew the praise of [[Charles Darwin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lizabeth Aggasiz wrote, at the Strait: '</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>he Hassler pursued her course, past a seemingly endless panorama of mountains and forests rising into the pale regions of snow and ice, where lay glaciers in which every rift and crevasse, as well as the many cascades flowing down to join the waters beneath, could be counted as she steamed by them</span>
				<span class='text'></span>

				<span class='text'>In 1873, a private philanthropist (John Anderson) gave Agassiz the island of [[Penikese]], in [[Buzzards Bay (bay)|Buzzards Bay]], Massachusetts (south of [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]]), and presented him with $50,000 to permanently endow it as a practical school of natural science, especially devoted to the study of marine zoology</span>
				<span class='text'>The John Anderson school collapsed soon after Agassiz's death, but is considered a precursor of the Woods Hole [[Marine Biological Laboratory]], which is nearby</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Agassiz was in modern terms a [[creationist]] who believed nature had order because God created it directly</span>
				<span class='text'>Agassiz viewed his career in science as a search for ideas in the mind of the creator expressed in creation</span>
				<span class='text'>Agassiz denied that [[:wikt:Migration|migration]] and [[adaptation]] could account for the geographical age or any of the past</span>
				<span class='text'>Adaptation takes time; in an example, Agassiz questioned how plants or animals could migrate through regions they were not equipped to handle</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Blowers2008 /&gt; According to Agassiz the conditions in which particular creatures live &quot;are the conditions necessary to their maintenance, and what among organized beings is essential to their temporal existence must be at least one of the conditions under which they were created&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Agassiz questioned how fish of the same species live in lakes well separated with no joining waterway, concluding they were created at both locations</span>
				<span class='text'>He held that the intelligent adaptation of creatures to their environments testified to an intelligent plan</span>
				<span class='text'>According to historian Paul Blowers, the conclusions of his studies led him to believe that whichever region each animal was found in, was created there &quot;animals are naturally autochthones wherever they are found&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He later extended this idea to humans in his theory of polygenism</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Blowers2008 /&gt; This holds that animals, plants and humans were all created in &quot;special provinces&quot; with distinct populations of species created in and for each province</span>
				<span class='text'>He claimed plants, animals and humans did not originate in pairs but were created in large numbers</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Agassiz, the different races were created in different provinces, each race was [[:wikt:indigenous|indigenous]] to the province it was created in, citing evidence from [[Culture of Egypt|Egyptian]] monuments to prove that racial types had been fixed for at least five millennia</span>
				<span class='text'>He held that all species and human races are [[punctuated equilibrium|fixed]], and that species do not evolve into other species</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Blowers2008 /&gt; The provinces that the different races were created in included ''Western American Temperate'' (the indigenous peoples west of the Rockies), ''Eastern American Temperate'' (east of the Rockies), ''Tropical Asiatic'' (south of the Himalayas), ''Temperate Asiatic'' (east of the Urals and north of the Himalayas), ''South American Temperate'' (South America), ''New Holland'' (Australia), ''Arctic'' (Alaska and Arctic Canada)</span>
				<span class='text'>''Cape of Good Hope'' (South Africa), and ''American Tropical'' (Central America and the West Indies)</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=June 2014}}Agassiz like other polygenists believed the [[Book of Genesis]] recounted the origin of the white race only and that the animals and plants in the Bible refer only to those species proximate and familiar to [[Adam and Eve]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Agassiz, [[Josiah Clark Nott]], and other polygenists such as [[George Gliddon]], believed that the original Hebrew form of the name Adam came from a Biblical Hebrew [[consonantal root]] referring to redness, so that the name can be interpreted to mean &quot;to show red in the face&quot; or &quot;blusher&quot;; since only light skinned people can blush, then the biblical Adam must be the Caucasian race</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Blowers2008 /&gt; Agassiz believed that the writers of the Bible only knew of local events, for example [[Noah's flood]] was a local event only known to the regions that were populated by ancient Hebrews</span>
				<span class='text'>Agassiz also believed that the writers of the Bible did not know about any events other than what was going on in their own region and their intermediate neighbors</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Blowers2008 /&gt;Per Blowers, Agassiz also opposed [[monogenism]] and evolution, believing that the theory of evolution reduced the wisdom of God to an impersonal materialism</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Blowers2008 /&gt;  [[Nathaniel Shaler]] studied under Agassiz at [[Harvard]], and shared his views on polygenism</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Nancy, ''The reconstruction of American liberalism, 1865–1914'', UNC Press Books, 2002, p</span>
				<span class='text'>77&lt;/ref&gt;[[Stephen Jay Gould]] asserted that Agassiz's observations sprang from racist bias, in particular from his  revulsion on first encountering African-Americans in the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Stephen Jay Gould, &quot;Flaws in a Victorian Veil,&quot; Chapter&amp;nbsp;16 in ''[[The Panda's Thumb (book)|The Panda's Thumb]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; However, Blowers notes that despite favouring polygenism, Agassiz rejected racism and believed in a spiritualized human unity</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Blowers2008 /&gt; According to Blowers, Agassiz believed God made all men equal:{{quote|Those intellectual and moral qualities which are so eminently developed in civilized society, but which equally exist in the natural dispositions of all human races, constituting the higher unity among men, making them all equal before God</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Blowers2008 /&gt;}}The accusation of racism has occasionally prompted the renaming of landmarks, schoolhouses, and other institutions which bear the name of Agassiz (which abound in Massachusetts)</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Opinions on these events are often mixed, given his extensive scientific legacy in other areas</span>
