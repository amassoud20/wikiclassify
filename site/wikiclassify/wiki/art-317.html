				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Thought=={{See also|Being and Nothingness}}Sartre's primary idea is that people, as humans, are &quot;condemned to be free&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Existentialism and Humanism''&lt;/ref&gt; This theory relies upon his position that there is no creator, and is illustrated using the example of the [[paper cutter]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Sartre says that if one considered a paper cutter, one would assume that the creator would have had a plan for it: an essence</span>
				<span class='text'>Sartre said that human beings have no essence before their existence because there is no Creator</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus: &quot;existence precedes essence&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Existentialism and Humanism'', page 27&lt;/ref&gt; This forms the basis for his assertion that since one cannot explain one's own actions and behaviour by referencing any specific human nature, they are necessarily fully responsible for those actions</span>

				<span class='text'>We need to experience &quot;death consciousness&quot; so as to wake up ourselves as to what is really important; the authentic in our lives which is life experience, not knowledge</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In this way death emphasizes the burden of our free, individual existence</span>
				<span class='text'>s a junior lecturer at the Lycée du [[Le Havre|Havre]] in 1938, Sartre wrote the novel ''[[Nausea (novel)|La Nausée]]'' (''Nausea''), which serves in some ways as a [[manifesto]] of [[existentialism]] and remains one of his most famous books</span>
				<span class='text'>Taking a page from the [[Husserl|German]] [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] movement, he believed that our ideas are the product of experiences of real-life situations, and that novels and plays can well describe such fundamental experiences, having equal value to discursive essays for the elaboration of philosophical theories such as existentialism</span>
				<span class='text'>With such purpose, this novel concerns a dejected researcher (Roquentin) in a town similar to Le Havre who becomes starkly conscious of the fact that inanimate objects and situations remain absolutely indifferent to his existence</span>
				<span class='text'>As such, they show themselves to be resistant to whatever significance human consciousness might perceive in them</span>
				<span class='text'>e also took inspiration from phenomenologist epistemology, explained by Franz Adler in this way: &quot;Man chooses and makes himself by acting</span>
				<span class='text'>Any action implies the judgment that he is right under the circumstances not only for the actor, but also for everybody else in similar circumstances</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Social Thought of Jean-Paul Sartre | journal = American Journal of Sociology | first = Franz | last = Adler | volume = 55 | issue = 3&lt;!--|accessdate=16 May 2013--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;This indifference of &quot;things in themselves&quot; (closely linked with the later notion of &quot;being-in-itself&quot; in his ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'') has the effect of highlighting all the more the freedom Roquentin has to perceive and act in the world; everywhere he looks, he finds situations imbued with meanings which bear the stamp of his existence</span>
				<span class='text'>Hence the &quot;nausea&quot; referred to in the title of the book; all that he encounters in his everyday life is suffused with a pervasive, even horrible, taste—specifically, his freedom</span>
				<span class='text'>The book takes the term from [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', where it is used in the context of the often nauseating quality of existence</span>
				<span class='text'>No matter how much Roquentin longs for something else or something different, he cannot get away from this harrowing evidence of his engagement with the world</span>
				<span class='text'>he novel also acts as a terrifying realization of some of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s fundamental ideas about  freedom; Sartre uses the idea of the autonomy of the will (that [[morality]] is derived from our ability to choose in reality; the ability to choose being derived from human freedom; embodied in the famous saying &quot;Condemned to be free&quot;) as a way to show the world's indifference to the individual</span>
				<span class='text'>The freedom that Kant exposed is here a strong burden, for the freedom to act towards objects is ultimately useless, and the practical application of Kant's ideas proves to be bitterly rejected</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|Jean-Paul Sartre and [[Simone de Beauvoir]] at the [[Honoré de Balzac|Balzac]] Memorial]]While the broad focus of Sartre's life revolved around the notion of human freedom, he began a sustained intellectual participation in more public matters towards the end of the Second World War, around 1944-45</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Baert 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this—before the Second World War—he was content with the role of an apolitical liberal intellectual: &quot;Now teaching at a lycée in Laon [</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> Sartre made his headquarters the Dome café at the crossing of Montparnasse and Raspail boulevards</span>
				<span class='text'>He attended plays, read novels, and dined &lt;nowiki&gt;[with]&lt;/nowiki&gt; women</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote</span>
				<span class='text'>And he was published</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gerassi 1989: 134&lt;/ref&gt; Sartre and his lifelong companion, de Beauvoir, existed, in her words, where &quot;the world about us was a mere backdrop against which our private lives were played out&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;de Beauvoir 1958: 339&lt;/ref&gt;Sartre portrayed his own pre-war situation in the character Mathieu, chief protagonist in ''[[The Age of Reason (Sartre)|The Age of Reason]]'', which was completed during Sartre's first year as a soldier in the Second World War</span>
				<span class='text'>By forging Mathieu as an absolute [[rationalist]], analyzing every situation, and functioning entirely on reason, he removed any strands of authentic content from his character and as a result, Mathieu could &quot;recognize no allegiance except to [him]self&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Sartre 1942: 13&lt;/ref&gt; though he realized that without &quot;responsibility for my own existence, it would seem utterly absurd to go on existing&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Sartre 1942: 14&lt;/ref&gt; Mathieu's commitment was only to himself, never to the outside world</span>
				<span class='text'>Mathieu was restrained from action each time because he had no reasons for acting</span>
				<span class='text'>Sartre then, for these reasons, was not compelled to participate in the [[Spanish Civil War]], and it took the invasion of his own country to motivate him into action and to provide a crystallization of these ideas</span>
				<span class='text'>It was the war that gave him a purpose beyond himself, and the atrocities of the war can be seen as the turning point in his public stance</span>
				<span class='text'>he war opened Sartre's eyes to a political reality he had not yet understood until forced into continual engagement with it: &quot;the world itself destroyed Sartre's illusions about isolated self-determining individuals and made clear his own personal stake in the events of the time</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; in which he remained an active participant until the end of the war</span>
				<span class='text'>He continued to write ferociously, and it was due to this &quot;crucial experience of war and captivity that Sartre began to try to build up a positive moral system and to express it through literature&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Thody 1964: 21&lt;/ref&gt;The symbolic initiation of this new phase in Sartre’s work is packaged in the introduction he wrote for a new journal, ''[[Les Temps modernes]]'', in October 1945</span>
				<span class='text'>Here he aligned the journal, and thus himself, with the Left and called for writers to express their political commitment</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Aronson 1980: 10&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, this alignment was indefinite, directed more to the concept of the Left than a specific party of the Left</span>
				<span class='text'>artre's philosophy lent itself to his being a [[public intellectual]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He envisaged culture as a very fluid concept; neither pre-determined, nor definitely finished; instead, in true [[existentialism|existential]] fashion, &quot;culture was always conceived as a process of continual invention and re-invention</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; This marks Sartre, the intellectual, as a [[pragmatism|pragmatist]], willing to move and shift stance along with events</span>
				<span class='text'>He did not dogmatically follow a cause other than the belief in [[liberty|human freedom]], preferring to retain a pacifist's objectivity</span>
				<span class='text'>It is this overarching theme of freedom that means his work &quot;subverts the bases for distinctions among the disciplines&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kirsner 2003: 13&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, he was able to hold knowledge across a vast array of subjects: &quot;the international world order, the political and economic organisation of contemporary society, especially France, the institutional and legal frameworks that regulate the lives of ordinary citizens, the educational system, the media networks that control and disseminate information</span>
				<span class='text'>Sartre systematically refused to keep quiet about what he saw as inequalities and injustices in the world</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Scriven 1999: xii&lt;/ref&gt;Sartre always sympathized with the Left, and supported the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF) until the 1956 Soviet invasion of Hungary</span>
				<span class='text'>Following the [[Liberation of France|Liberation]] the PCF were infuriated by Sartre's philosophy, which appeared to lure young French men and women away from the ideology of communism and into Sartre’s own existentialism</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Scriven 1999: 13&lt;/ref&gt; From 1956 onwards Sartre rejected the claims of the PCF to represent the French working classes, objecting to its &quot;authoritarian tendencies&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>In the late 1960s Sartre supported the [[Maoism|Maoists]], a movement that rejected the authority of established communist parties</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Aronson 1980: 121&lt;/ref&gt; The greatest difficulties that he and all public intellectuals of the time faced were the increasing technological aspects of the world that were outdating the printed word as a form of expression</span>
				<span class='text'>In Sartre's opinion, the &quot;traditional bourgeois literary forms remain innately superior&quot;, but there is &quot;a recognition that the new technological 'mass media' forms must be embraced&quot; if Sartre's ethical and political goals as an authentic, committed intellectual are to be achieved: the demystification of [[bourgeois]] political practices and the raising of the consciousness, both political and cultural, of the working class</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Scriven 1993: 8&lt;/ref&gt;The struggle for Sartre was against the monopolising moguls who were beginning to take over the media and destroy the role of the intellectual</span>
				<span class='text'>His attempts to reach a public were mediated by these powers, and it was often these powers he had to campaign against</span>
				<span class='text'>He was skilled enough, however, to circumvent some of these issues by his interactive approach to the various forms of media, advertising his radio interviews in a newspaper column for example, and vice versa</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Scriven 1993: 22&lt;/ref&gt;The role of a public intellectual can lead to the individual placing himself in danger as he engages with disputed topics</span>
				<span class='text'>In Sartre's case, this was witnessed in June 1961, when a plastic bomb exploded in the entrance of his apartment building</span>
				<span class='text'>His public support of Algerian [[self-determination]] at the time had led Sartre to become a target of the campaign of terror that mounted as the colonists' position deteriorated</span>
				<span class='text'>A similar occurrence took place the next year and he had begun to receive threatening letters from [[Oran|Oran, Algeria]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Aronson 1980: 157&lt;/ref&gt;==Literature==Sartre wrote successfully in a number of literary modes and made major contributions to literary criticism and literary biography</span>
				<span class='text'>His plays are richly symbolic and serve as a means of conveying his philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>The best-known, ''Huis-clos'' (''[[No Exit]]''), contains the famous line &quot;L'enfer, c'est les autres&quot;, usually translated as &quot;Hell is other people</span>

				<span class='text'>In this way, ''Roads to Freedom'' presents a less theoretical and more practical approach to [[existentialism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>espite their similarities as polemicists, novelists, adapters, and playwrights, Sartre's literary work has been counterposed, often pejoratively, to that of Camus in the popular imagination</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1948 the [[Roman Catholic Church]] placed Sartre's oeuvre on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|''Index Librorum Prohibitorum'' (List of Prohibited Books)]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Criticism==Some philosophers argue that Sartre's thought is contradictory</span>
				<span class='text'>Specifically, they believe that Sartre makes metaphysical arguments despite his claim that his philosophical views ignore metaphysics</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Herbert Marcuse]] criticized ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' for projecting anxiety and meaninglessness onto the nature of existence itself: &quot;Insofar as Existentialism is a philosophical doctrine, it remains an idealistic doctrine: it [[hypostatic abstraction|hypostatizes]] specific historical conditions of human existence into ontological and metaphysical characteristics</span>
				<span class='text'>Existentialism thus becomes part of the very ideology which it attacks, and its radicalism is illusory</span>

				<span class='text'>161&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Letter on Humanism'', Heidegger criticized Sartre's existentialism:&lt;blockquote&gt;Existentialism says existence precedes essence</span>
				<span class='text'>In this statement he is taking ''existentia'' and ''essentia'' according to their metaphysical meaning, which, from Plato's time on, has said that ''essentia'' precedes ''existentia''</span>
				<span class='text'>Sartre reverses this statement</span>
				<span class='text'>But the reversal of a metaphysical statement remains a metaphysical statement</span>
				<span class='text'>With it, he stays with metaphysics, in oblivion of the truth of Being</span>
