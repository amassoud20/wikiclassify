				<span class='text'>''The Crying of Lot 49'' also continues Pynchon's strategy of composing parodic song lyrics and punning names, and referencing aspects of [[popular culture]] within his prose narratives</span>
				<span class='text'>In particular, it incorporates a very direct [[The Crying of Lot 49#Vladimir Nabokov|allusion]] to the protagonist of Nabokov's ''[[Lolita]]'' within the lyric of a love lament sung by a member of &quot;The Paranoids&quot;, a teenage band who deliberately sing their songs with British accents (p</span>

				<span class='text'>In this way, Pynchon's text enacts a type of [[irony|dramatic irony]] whereby neither the characters nor the various [[narrator|narrative voices]] are aware of specific historical circumstances, such as the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] and, except as hints, premonitions and mythography, the complicity between Western corporate interests and the Nazi war machine, which figure prominently in readers' apprehensions of the novel's historical context</span>

				<span class='text'>His writings demonstrate a strong affinity with the practitioners and artifacts of [[low culture]], including [[comic book]]s and [[animated cartoon|cartoons]], [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction]], popular films, [[television|television programs]], [[cookery]], [[urban myth]]s, [[conspiracy theories]], and [[folk art]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This blurring of the conventional boundary between &quot;High&quot; and &quot;low&quot; culture has been seen as one of the defining characteristics of his writing</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}In particular, Pynchon has revealed himself in his fiction and non-fiction as an aficionado of [[popular music]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Song lyrics and mock [[musical theater|musical]] numbers appear in each of his novels, and, in his autobiographical introduction to the ''[[Slow Learner]]'' collection of early stories, he reveals a fondness for both [[jazz]] and [[rock and roll]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The character McClintic Sphere in ''V</span>
				<span class='text'>' is a fictional composite of jazz musicians such as [[Ornette Coleman]], [[Charlie Parker]] and [[Thelonious Monk]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''The Crying of Lot 49'', the lead singer of &quot;The Paranoids&quot; sports &quot;a [[The Beatles|Beatle]] haircut&quot; and sings with an English accent</span>
				<span class='text'>In the closing pages of ''Gravity's Rainbow'', there is an apocryphal report that Tyrone Slothrop, the novel's protagonist, played [[kazoo]] and [[harmonica]] as a guest musician on a record released by [[The Fool (design collective)|The Fool]] in the 1960s (having [[Magic realism|magically]] recovered the latter instrument, his &quot;[[Blues harp|harp]]&quot;, in a German stream in 1945, after losing it down the toilet in 1939 at the Roseland Ballroom in [[Roxbury, Massachusetts|Roxbury]], [[Boston]], to the strains of the jazz standard &quot;[[Cherokee (Ray Noble song)|Cherokee]]&quot;, upon which tune Charlie Parker was simultaneously inventing [[bebop]] in New York, as Pynchon describes)</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''Vineland'', both Zoyd Wheeler and Isaiah Two Four are also musicians: Zoyd played keyboards in a '60s [[surf music|surf]] band called &quot;The Corvairs&quot;, while Isaiah played in a [[punk rock|punk]] band called &quot;Billy Barf and the Vomitones&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''Mason &amp; Dixon'', one of the characters plays on the &quot;Clavier&quot; the varsity drinking song that will later become &quot;[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]&quot;; while in another episode a character remarks tangentially [[Stand by your man|&quot;Sometimes, it's hard to be a woman&quot;]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n his introduction to ''[[Slow Learner]]'', Pynchon acknowledges a debt to the anarchic bandleader [[Spike Jones]], and in 1994, he penned a 3000-word set of [[liner notes]] for the album ''Spiked!'', a collection of Jones's recordings released on the short-lived BMG Catalyst label</span>
				<span class='text'>Pynchon also wrote the liner notes for ''Nobody's Cool'', the second album of [[indie rock]] band [[Lotion (band)|Lotion]], in which he states that &quot;rock and roll remains one of the last honorable callings, and a working band is a miracle of everyday life</span>
				<span class='text'>Which is basically what these guys do</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He is also known to be a fan of [[Roky Erickson]]</span>
				<span class='text'>nvestigations and digressions into the realms of [[human sexuality]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[mathematics]], [[science]], and [[technology]] recur throughout Pynchon's works</span>
				<span class='text'>One of his earliest short stories, &quot;Low-lands&quot; (1960), features a meditation on [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg's]] [[uncertainty principle]] as a metaphor for telling stories about one's own experiences</span>
				<span class='text'>His next published work, &quot;Entropy&quot; (1960), introduced [[entropy|the concept]] which was to become synonymous with Pynchon's name (though Pynchon later admitted the &quot;shallowness of [his] understanding&quot; of the subject, and noted that choosing an abstract concept first and trying to construct a narrative around it was &quot;a lousy way to go about writing a story&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>Another early story, &quot;Under the Rose&quot; (1961), includes among its cast of characters a [[cyborg]] set anachronistically in [[Victorian-era]] [[Egypt]] (a type of writing now called [[steampunk]])</span>
				<span class='text'>This story, significantly reworked by Pynchon, appears as Chapter 3 of ''V</span>
				<span class='text'>' &quot;The Secret Integration&quot; (1964), Pynchon's last published short story, is a sensitively handled [[coming-of-age]] tale in which a group of young boys face the consequences of the American policy of [[racial integration]]</span>
				<span class='text'>At one point in the story, the boys attempt to understand the new policy by way of the [[antiderivative|mathematical operation]], the only sense of the word with which they are familiar</span>
				<span class='text'>'The Crying of Lot 49'' also alludes to entropy and [[communication theory]], and contains scenes and descriptions which parody or appropriate [[calculus]], [[Zeno's paradoxes]], and the [[thought experiment]] known as [[Maxwell's demon]]</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time, the novel also investigates [[homosexuality]], [[celibacy]] and both medically sanctioned and illicit [[psychedelic drug]] use</span>
				<span class='text'>''Gravity's Rainbow'' describes many varieties of [[sexual fetishism]] (including [[sado-masochism]], [[coprophilia]] and a borderline case of [[tentacle erotica]]), and features numerous episodes of drug use, most notably [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] but also [[cocaine]], naturally occurring [[hallucinogen]]s, and the mushroom ''[[Amanita muscaria]]</span>
				<span class='text'>' ''Gravity's Rainbow'' also derives much from Pynchon's background in mathematics: at one point, the geometry of garter belts is compared with that of [[cathedral]] spires, both described as [[mathematical singularity|mathematical singularities]]</span>
				<span class='text'>''Mason &amp; Dixon'' explores the scientific, theological, and socio-cultural foundations of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Age of Reason]] while also depicting the relationships between actual historical figures and fictional characters in intricate detail and, like ''Gravity's Rainbow'', is an archetypal example of the genre of [[historiographic metafiction]]</span>

				<span class='text'>hanks to his influence on Gibson and Stephenson in particular, Pynchon became one of the progenitors of [[cyberpunk]] fiction; a 1987 essay in ''[[Spin magazine|Spin]]'' magazine by [[Timothy Leary]] explicitly named ''Gravity's Rainbow'' as the &quot;Old Testament&quot; of cyberpunk, with Gibson's ''[[Neuromancer]]'' and its sequels as the &quot;New Testament&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Though the term &quot;cyberpunk&quot; did not become prevalent until the early 1980s, since Leary's article many readers have retroactively included ''Gravity's Rainbow'' in the genre, along with other works—''e</span>
