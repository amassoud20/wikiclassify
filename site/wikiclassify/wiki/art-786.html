				<span class='text'>In a ''DownBeat'' article in 1960 he recalled: &quot;the first time I heard Bird play, it hit me right between the eyes</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;JWConJWC&quot;/&gt; Parker became an early idol, and they played together on occasion in the late 1940s</span>
				<span class='text'>ontemporary correspondence shows that Coltrane was already known as &quot;Trane&quot; by this point, and that the music from some 1946 recording sessions had been played for trumpeter Miles Davis—possibly impressing him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ALLMUSIC&quot;/&gt;Coltrane was a member of groups led by [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Earl Bostic]] and [[Johnny Hodges]] in the early to mid-1950s</span>
				<span class='text'>==Miles and Monk period (1955–1957)===[[File:Miles Davis by Palumbo</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|The rivalry, tension, and mutual respect between Coltrane and bandleader Miles Davis was formative for both of their careers</span>
				<span class='text'>]Coltrane was freelancing in Philadelphia in the summer of 1955 while studying with guitarist [[Dennis Sandole]] when he received a call from Davis</span>
				<span class='text'>The trumpeter, whose success during the late forties had been followed by several years of decline in activity and reputation, due in part to his struggles with [[heroin]], was again active and about to form a quintet</span>
				<span class='text'>Coltrane was with this edition of the Davis band (known as the &quot;First Great Quintet&quot;—along with [[Red Garland]] on piano, [[Paul Chambers]] on bass, and [[Philly Joe Jones]] on drums) from October 1955 to April 1957 (with a few absences), a period during which Davis released several influential recordings which revealed the first signs of Coltrane's growing ability</span>
				<span class='text'>This quintet, represented by two marathon recording sessions for [[Prestige Records|Prestige]] in 1956 that resulted in the albums ''[[Cookin' with The Miles Davis Quintet|Cookin']]'', ''[[Relaxin' with The Miles Davis Quintet|Relaxin']]'', ''[[Workin' with The Miles Davis Quintet|Workin']]'', and ''[[Steamin' with The Miles Davis Quintet|Steamin']]'', disbanded due in part to Coltrane's heroin addiction</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ALLMUSIC&quot; /&gt;During the later part of 1957 Coltrane worked with Thelonious Monk at New York’s [[Five Spot]], and played in Monk's quartet (July–December 1957), but, owing to contractual conflicts, took part in only one official studio recording session with this group</span>
				<span class='text'>Coltrane recorded many albums for Prestige under his own name at this time, but Monk refused to record for his old label</span>
				<span class='text'>A private recording made by Juanita Naima Coltrane of a 1958 reunion of the group was issued by Blue Note Records as ''Live at the Five Spot—Discovery!'' in 1993</span>
				<span class='text'>A high quality tape of a concert given by this quartet in November 1957 was also found later, and was released by Blue Note in 2005</span>
				<span class='text'>Recorded by [[Voice of America]], the performances confirm the group's reputation, and the resulting album, ''[[Thelonious Monk Quartet with John Coltrane at Carnegie Hall]]'', is widely acclaimed</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=October 2013}}''[[Blue Train (album)|Blue Train]]'', Coltrane's sole date as leader for Blue Note, featuring trumpeter [[Lee Morgan]], bassist [[Paul Chambers]], and trombonist [[Curtis Fuller]], is often considered his best album from this period</span>
				<span class='text'>Four of its five tracks are original Coltrane compositions, and the title track, &quot;Moment's Notice&quot;, and &quot;[[Lazy Bird]]&quot;, have become standards</span>
				<span class='text'>Both tunes employed the first examples of his chord substitution cycles known as [[Coltrane changes]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ALLMUSIC&quot; /&gt;===Davis and Coltrane===Coltrane rejoined Davis in January 1958</span>
				<span class='text'>In October of that year, jazz critic [[Ira Gitler]] coined the term &quot;[[sheets of sound]]&quot; to describe the style Coltrane developed during his stint with Monk and was perfecting in Davis' group, now a sextet</span>
				<span class='text'>His playing was compressed, with rapid runs cascading in hundreds of notes per minute</span>
				<span class='text'>He stayed with Davis until April 1960, working with alto saxophonist [[Cannonball Adderley]]; pianists [[Red Garland]], [[Bill Evans]], and [[Wynton Kelly]]; bassist [[Paul Chambers]]; and drummers [[Philly Joe Jones]] and [[Jimmy Cobb]]</span>
				<span class='text'>During this time he participated in the Davis sessions ''[[Milestones (Miles Davis album)|Milestones]]'' and ''[[Kind of Blue]]'', and the concert recordings ''[[Miles &amp; Monk at Newport]]'' and ''Jazz at the Plaza''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ALLMUSIC&quot; /&gt;===Period with Atlantic Records (1959–1961)===At the end of this period Coltrane recorded his first album as leader for [[Atlantic Records]], ''[[Giant Steps]]'' (1959), which contained only his compositions</span>
				<span class='text'>The album's title track is generally considered to have the most complex and difficult chord progression of any widely-played jazz composition</span>
				<span class='text'>''Giant Steps'' utilizes [[Coltrane changes]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His development of these altered chord progression cycles led to further experimentation with improvised melody and harmony that he would continue throughout his career</span>

				<span class='text'>gg |title = 'Giant Steps' |description = One of Coltrane's most acclaimed recordings, &quot;Giant Steps&quot; features harmonic structures more complex than were used by most musicians of the time</span>
				<span class='text'>}|}Coltrane formed his first quartet for live performances in 1960 for an appearance at the Jazz Gallery in New York City</span>
				<span class='text'>After moving through different personnel including [[Steve Kuhn]], [[Pete La Roca]], and [[Billy Higgins]], the lineup stabilized in the fall with pianist [[McCoy Tyner]], bassist [[Steve Davis (bassist)|Steve Davis]], and drummer [[Elvin Jones]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Tyner, from Philadelphia, had been a friend of Coltrane's for some years and the two men had an understanding that the pianist would join Coltrane when Tyner felt ready for the exposure of regularly working with him</span>
				<span class='text'>Also recorded in the same sessions{{clarify|date=October 2013}} were the later released albums ''[[Coltrane's Sound]]'' and ''[[Coltrane Plays the Blues]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>oltrane's first record with his new group was also his debut playing the [[soprano saxophone]], the hugely successful ''[[My Favorite Things (album)|My Favorite Things]]'' (1960)</span>
				<span class='text'>Around the end of his tenure with Davis, Coltrane had begun playing soprano, an unconventional move considering the instrument's neglect in jazz at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>His interest in the straight saxophone most likely arose from his admiration for [[Sidney Bechet]] and the work of his contemporary, [[Steve Lacy]], even though Davis claimed to have given Coltrane his first soprano saxophone</span>
				<span class='text'>The new soprano sound was coupled with further exploration</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, on the Gershwin tune &quot;But Not for Me&quot;, Coltrane employs the kinds of restless harmonic movement (Coltrane changes) used on ''Giant Steps'' (movement in [[major third]]s rather than conventional [[perfect fourth]]s) over the A sections instead of a conventional [[Turnaround (music)|turnaround]] progression</span>
				<span class='text'>Several other tracks recorded in the session utilized this harmonic device, including &quot;26–2&quot;, &quot;Satellite&quot;, &quot;[[Body and Soul (song)|Body and Soul]]&quot;, and &quot;[[The Night Has a Thousand Eyes (jazz standard)|The Night Has a Thousand Eyes]]&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>It was at Van Gelder's new studio in [[Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey]] that Coltrane would record most of his records for the label</span>
				<span class='text'>y early 1961, bassist Davis had been replaced by [[Reggie Workman]], while [[Eric Dolphy]] joined the group as a second horn around the same time</span>
				<span class='text'>The quintet had a celebrated (and extensively recorded) residency in November 1961 at the [[Village Vanguard]], which demonstrated Coltrane's new direction</span>
				<span class='text'>It featured the most experimental music he had played up to this point, influenced by [[Music of India|Indian]] [[ragas]], the recent developments in [[modal jazz]], and the burgeoning [[free jazz]] movement</span>
				<span class='text'>[[John Gilmore (musician)|John Gilmore]], a longtime saxophonist with musician [[Sun Ra]], was particularly influential; after hearing a Gilmore performance, Coltrane is reported to have said &quot;He's got it! Gilmore's got the concept!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Corbett | first=John | title=John Gilmore: The Hard Bop Homepage | work=[[Down Beat]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most celebrated of the Vanguard tunes, the 15-minute blues, &quot;Chasin' the 'Trane&quot;, was strongly inspired by Gilmore's music</span>

				<span class='text'>Audiences, too, were perplexed; in France he was booed during his final tour with Davis</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1961, ''[[Down Beat]]'' magazine indicted Coltrane and Dolphy as players of &quot;Anti-Jazz&quot;, in an article that bewildered and upset the musicians</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;kofsky&quot; /&gt; Coltrane admitted some of his early solos were based mostly on technical ideas</span>
				<span class='text'>Furthermore, Dolphy's angular, voice-like playing earned him a reputation as a figurehead of the &quot;New Thing&quot; (also known as &quot;Free Jazz&quot; and &quot;Avant-Garde&quot;) movement led by [[Ornette Coleman]], which was also denigrated by some jazz musicians (including Davis) and critics</span>
				<span class='text'>But as Coltrane's style further developed, he was determined to make each performance &quot;a whole expression of one's being&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>gg |title = 'In a Sentimental Mood' |description = The romantic ballad features Coltrane with pianist Duke Ellington</span>
				<span class='text'>}In 1962, Dolphy departed and [[Jimmy Garrison]] replaced Workman as bassist</span>
				<span class='text'>From then on, the &quot;Classic Quartet&quot;, as it came to be known, with Tyner, Garrison, and Jones, produced searching, spiritually driven work</span>
				<span class='text'>Coltrane was moving toward a more harmonically static style that allowed him to expand his improvisations rhythmically, melodically, and motivically</span>
				<span class='text'>Harmonically complex music was still present, but on stage Coltrane heavily favored continually reworking his &quot;standards&quot;: &quot;Impressions&quot;, &quot;My Favorite Things&quot;, and &quot;I Want to Talk About You&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>he criticism of the quintet with Dolphy may have had an impact on Coltrane</span>
				<span class='text'>In contrast to the radicalism of his 1961 recordings at the Village Vanguard, his studio albums in the following two years (with the exception of ''[[Coltrane (1962 album)|Coltrane]]'', 1962, which featured a blistering version of [[Harold Arlen]]'s &quot;Out of This World&quot;) were much more conservative</span>
				<span class='text'>He recorded an album of ballads and participated in collaborations with [[Duke Ellington]] on the album ''[[Duke Ellington and John Coltrane]]'' and with deep-voiced ballad singer [[Johnny Hartman]] on an [[John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman|eponymous co-credited]] album</span>
				<span class='text'>The album ''[[Ballads (John Coltrane album)|Ballads]]'' (recorded 1961–62) is emblematic of Coltrane's versatility, as the quartet shed new light on old-fashioned standards such as &quot;It's Easy to Remember&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite a more polished approach in the studio, in concert the quartet continued to balance &quot;standards&quot; and its own more exploratory and challenging music, as can be heard on the ''[[Impressions (John Coltrane album)|Impressions]]'' (recorded 1961–63), ''[[Live at Birdland]]'' and ''[[Newport '63]]'' (both recorded 1963)</span>
				<span class='text'>''Impressions'' consists of two extended jams including the title track along with &quot;Dear Old Stockholm&quot;, &quot;After the Rain&quot; and a blues</span>
				<span class='text'>Coltrane later said he enjoyed having a &quot;balanced catalogue</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}The Classic Quartet produced their best-selling album, ''[[A Love Supreme]]'', in December 1964</span>
				<span class='text'>It is reported that Coltrane, who struggled with repeated drug addiction, derived inspiration for ''A Love Supreme'' through a near overdose in 1957 which galvanized him to spirituality</span>

				<span class='text'>om}}&lt;/ref&gt; A culmination of much of Coltrane's work up to this point, this four-part suite is an ode to his faith in and love for God</span>
				<span class='text'>These spiritual concerns would characterize much of Coltrane's composing and playing from this point onwards, as can be seen from album titles such as ''Ascension'', ''Om'' and ''Meditations''</span>
				<span class='text'>The fourth movement of ''A Love Supreme'', &quot;Psalm&quot;, is, in fact, a musical setting for an original poem to God written by Coltrane, and printed in the album's liner notes</span>
				<span class='text'>Coltrane plays almost exactly one note for each syllable of the poem, and bases his phrasing on the words</span>
				<span class='text'>The album was composed at [[John Coltrane Home|Coltrane's home]] in [[Dix Hills, New York|Dix Hills]] on Long Island</span>

				<span class='text'>]In his late period, Coltrane showed an increasing interest in [[avant-garde jazz]], purveyed by Ornette Coleman, [[Albert Ayler]], Sun Ra and others</span>
				<span class='text'>In developing his late style, Coltrane was especially influenced by the dissonance of Ayler's trio with bassist [[Gary Peacock]] and drummer [[Sunny Murray]], a rhythm section honed with [[Cecil Taylor]] as leader</span>
				<span class='text'>Coltrane championed many younger free jazz musicians such as [[Archie Shepp]], and under his influence Impulse! became a leading free jazz record label</span>
				<span class='text'>fter ''A Love Supreme'' was recorded, Ayler's style became more prominent in Coltrane's music</span>
				<span class='text'>A series of recordings with the Classic Quartet in the first half of 1965 show Coltrane's playing becoming increasingly abstract, with greater incorporation of devices like [[multiphonics]], utilization of overtones, and playing in the [[altissimo]] register, as well as a mutated return of Coltrane's sheets of sound</span>
				<span class='text'>In the studio, he all but abandoned his soprano to concentrate on the tenor saxophone</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, the quartet responded to the leader by playing with increasing freedom</span>
				<span class='text'>The group's evolution can be traced through the recordings ''[[The John Coltrane Quartet Plays]]'', ''[[Living Space (album)|Living Space]]'', ''[[Transition (John Coltrane album)|Transition]]'' (both June 1965), ''[[New Thing at Newport]]'' (July 1965), ''[[Sun Ship]]'' (August 1965), and ''[[First Meditations]]'' (September 1965)</span>
				<span class='text'>n June 1965, he went into Van Gelder's studio with ten other musicians (including Shepp, [[Pharoah Sanders]], [[Freddie Hubbard]], [[Marion Brown]], and [[John Tchicai]]) to record ''[[Ascension (John Coltrane album)|Ascension]]'', a 40-minute piece that included solos by the young avant-garde musicians (as well as Coltrane), and was controversial primarily for the collective improvisation sections that separated the solos</span>
				<span class='text'>After recording with the quartet over the next few months, Coltrane invited Sanders to join the band in September 1965</span>
				<span class='text'>While Coltrane used over-blowing frequently as an emotional exclamation-point, Sanders would overblow his entire solo, resulting in a constant screaming and screeching in the altissimo range of the instrument</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Percussionist Rashied Ali helped to augment Coltrane's sound in the last years of his life</span>

				<span class='text'>[[Rashied Ali]] joined the group as a second drummer</span>
				<span class='text'>This was the end of the quartet; claiming he was unable to hear himself over the two drummers, Tyner left the band shortly after the recording of ''[[Meditations (John Coltrane album)|Meditations]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Jones left in early 1966, dissatisfied by sharing drumming duties with Ali</span>

				<span class='text'>After the departure of Jones and Tyner, Coltrane led a quintet with Sanders on tenor saxophone, his second wife [[Alice Coltrane]] on piano, Garrison on bass, and Ali on drums</span>
				<span class='text'>Coltrane and Sanders were described by [[Nat Hentoff]] as &quot;[[glossolalia|speaking in tongues]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>When touring, the group was known for playing very lengthy versions of their repertoire, many stretching beyond 30 minutes and sometimes being an hour long</span>
				<span class='text'>Concert solos for band members often extended beyond fifteen minutes</span>
				<span class='text'>he group can be heard on several concert recordings from 1966, including ''[[Live at the Village Vanguard Again!]]'' and ''[[Live in Japan (John Coltrane album)|Live in Japan]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1967, Coltrane entered the studio several times; though pieces with Sanders have surfaced (the unusual &quot;To Be&quot;, which features both men on flutes), most of the recordings were either with the quartet minus Sanders (''[[Expression (album)|Expression]]'' and ''[[Stellar Regions]]'') or as a duo with Ali</span>
