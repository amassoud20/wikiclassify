				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Early life===Boccaccio grew up in Florence</span>
				<span class='text'>His father worked for the [[Compagnia dei Bardi]] and in the 1320s married Margherita dei Mardoli, who was of a well-to-do family</span>
				<span class='text'>Boccaccio may have been tutored by Giovanni Mazzuoli and received from him an early introduction to the works of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1326, when his father was appointed head of a bank, Boccaccio moved with his family to [[Naples]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Boccaccio was an apprentice at the bank but disliked the banking profession</span>
				<span class='text'>He persuaded his father to let him study law at the ''Studium'',&lt;ref name=&quot;bartlett 43&quot;/&gt; where for the next six years he studied [[canon law]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also pursued his interest in scientific and literary studies</span>

				<span class='text'>Chicago: Standard Educational Corporation&lt;/ref&gt;His father introduced him to the Neapolitan nobility and the French-influenced court of [[Robert the Wise]] (the king of Naples) in the 1330s</span>
				<span class='text'>At this time he fell in love with a married daughter of the king, who is portrayed as ''&quot;[[Fiammetta]]&quot;'' in many of Boccaccio's prose romances, including ''Il Filocolo'' (1338)</span>
				<span class='text'>Boccaccio became a friend of fellow Florentine [[Niccolò Acciaioli]], and benefited from his influence as the administrator, and perhaps the lover, of [[Catherine of Valois-Courtenay]], widow of [[Philip I of Taranto]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Acciaioli later became counselor to Queen [[Joan I of Naples]] and, eventually, her ''[[Seneschal|Grand Seneschal]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>t seems Boccaccio enjoyed law no more than banking, but his studies allowed him the opportunity to study widely and make good contacts with fellow scholars</span>
				<span class='text'>His early influences included Paolo da Perugia (a curator and author of a collection of [[myths]], the ''Collectiones''), the humanists Barbato da Sulmona and Giovanni Barrili, and the theologian [[Dionigi di Borgo San Sepolcro]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n his request, his mentor, [[Petrarch]] translated the two great epics of [[Homer]], the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'', in Latin</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|left|Boccaccio's statue in [[Uffizi]]]]In Naples, Boccaccio began what he considered his true vocation, poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>Works produced in this period include ''[[Filostrato]]'' and ''[[Teseida]]'' (the sources for [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]]'s ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'' and ''[[The Knight's Tale]]'', respectively), ''[[Filocolo]]'', a prose version of an existing French romance, and ''La caccia di Diana'', a poem in ''[[terza rima]]'' listing Neapolitan women</span>

				<span class='text'>occaccio returned to Florence in early 1341, avoiding the [[Bubonic plague|plague]] in that city of 1340, but also missing the visit of Petrarch to Naples in 1341</span>
				<span class='text'>He had left Naples due to tensions between the Angevin king and Florence</span>
				<span class='text'>His father had returned to Florence in 1338, where he had gone bankrupt</span>
				<span class='text'>His mother died shortly afterward (possibly, as she was unknown — see above)</span>
				<span class='text'>Although dissatisfied with his return to Florence, Boccaccio continued to work, producing ''Comedia delle ninfe fiorentine'' (also known as ''Ameto''), a mix of prose and poems, in 1341, completing the fifty [[canto]] allegorical poem ''Amorosa visione'' in 1342, and ''[[Elegia di Madonna Fiammetta|Fiammetta]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>The pastoral piece &quot;Ninfale fiesolano&quot; probably dates from this time also</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1343, Boccaccio's father remarried, to Bice del Bostichi</span>
				<span class='text'>His children by his first marriage had all died but he had another son, Iacopo, in 1344</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Giovanni Boccaccio and Florentines who have fled from the plague</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Giovanni Boccaccio and Florentines who have fled from the plague]]In Florence, the overthrow of [[Walter VI of Brienne|Walter of Brienne]] brought about the government of ''popolo minuto'' (&quot;small people&quot;, workers)</span>
				<span class='text'>It diminished the influence of the nobility and the wealthier merchant classes and assisted in the relative decline of Florence</span>
				<span class='text'>The city was hurt further, in 1348, by the [[Black Death]], which killed some three-quarters of the city's population, later represented in the ''Decameron''</span>
				<span class='text'>rom 1347, Boccaccio spent much time in Ravenna, seeking new patronage, and despite his claims, it is not certain whether he was present in plague-ravaged Florence</span>
				<span class='text'>His stepmother died during the epidemic and his father, as Minister of Supply in the city, was closely associated with the government efforts</span>
				<span class='text'>His father died in 1349 and as head of the family Boccaccio was forced into a more active role</span>

				<span class='text'>It is probable that the structures of many of the tales date from earlier in his career, but the choice of a hundred tales and the frame-story ''lieta brigata'' of three men and seven women dates from this time</span>
				<span class='text'>The work was largely complete by 1352</span>
				<span class='text'>It was Boccaccio's final effort in literature and one of his last works in Italian; the only other substantial work was ''[[Corbaccio]]'' (dated to either 1355 or 1365)</span>
				<span class='text'>Boccaccio revised and rewrote the ''Decameron'' in 1370–1371</span>
				<span class='text'>This manuscript has survived to the present day</span>
				<span class='text'>rom 1350, Boccaccio, although less of a scholar, became closely involved with Italian humanism and also with the Florentine government</span>
				<span class='text'>His first official mission was to [[Romagna]] in late 1350</span>
				<span class='text'>He revisited that city-state twice and also was sent to [[Brandenburg]], [[Milan]] and [[Avignon]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also pushed for the study of Greek, housing Barlaam of Calabria, and encouraging his tentative translations of works by [[Homer]], [[Euripides]], and [[Aristotle]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In these years he also took [[minor orders]]</span>

				<span class='text'>The meeting between the two was extremely fruitful and they were friends from then on, Boccaccio calling Petrarch his teacher and ''magister''</span>
				<span class='text'>Petrarch at that time encouraged Boccaccio to study classical Greek and Latin literature</span>
				<span class='text'>They met again in [[Padua]] in 1351, Boccaccio on an official mission to invite Petrarch to take a chair at the university in Florence</span>
				<span class='text'>Although unsuccessful, the discussions between the two were instrumental in Boccaccio writing the ''[[Genealogia deorum gentilium]]''; the first edition was completed in 1360 and this would remain one of the key reference works on classical mythology for over 400 years</span>
				<span class='text'>It served as an extended defense for the studies of ancient literature and thought</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite the Pagan beliefs at its core, Boccaccio believed that much could be learned from antiquity</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, he challenged the arguments of clerical intellectuals who wanted to limit access to classical sources to prevent any moral harm to Christian readers</span>
				<span class='text'>In that the revival of classical antiquity became necessary to the achievement of the Renaissance, his defense of the importance of ancient literature was an essential requirement for its development</span>

				<span class='text'>4</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The discussions also formalized Boccaccio's poetic ideas</span>
				<span class='text'>Certain sources also see a conversion of Boccaccio by Petrarch from the open humanist of the ''Decameron'' to a more ascetic style, closer to the dominant fourteenth century ethos</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, he followed Petrarch (and Dante) in the unsuccessful championing of an archaic and deeply allusive form of Latin poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1359 following a meeting with [[Pope Innocent VI]] and further meetings with Petrarch it is probable that Boccaccio took some kind of religious mantle</span>
				<span class='text'>There is a persistent, but unsupported, tale that he repudiated his earlier works, including the ''Decameron'', in 1362, as profane</span>

				<span class='text'>ollowing the failed coup of 1361, a number of Boccaccio's close friends and other acquaintances were executed or exiled in the subsequent purge</span>
				<span class='text'>Although not directly linked to the conspiracy, it was in this year that Boccaccio left Florence to reside in Certaldo, and became less involved in government affairs</span>
				<span class='text'>He did not undertake further missions for Florence until 1365, and traveled to Naples and then on to Padua and [[Venice]], where he met up with Petrarch in grand style at [[Palazzo Molina]], Petrarch's residence as well as the place of [[Petrarch's library]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He later returned to [[Certaldo]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He met Petrarch only once again, in Padua in 1368</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon hearing of the death of Petrarch (19 July 1374), Boccaccio wrote a commemorative poem, including it in his collection of lyric poems, the ''Rime''</span>
				<span class='text'>e returned to work for the Florentine government in 1365, undertaking a mission to [[Pope Urban V]]</span>
				<span class='text'>When the papacy returned to Rome from [[Avignon]] in 1367, Boccaccio was again sent to Urban, offering congratulations</span>
				<span class='text'>He also undertook diplomatic missions to Venice and Naples</span>
				<span class='text'>f his later works the moralistic biographies gathered as ''De casibus virorum illustrium'' (1355–74) and ''De mulieribus claris'' (1361–1375) were most significant</span>

				<span class='text'>It was mostly due to poor health and a premature weakening of his physical strength</span>
				<span class='text'>It also was due to disappointments in love</span>
				<span class='text'>Some such disappointment could explain why Boccaccio, having previously written always in praise of women and love, came suddenly to write in a bitter ''Corbaccio'' style</span>
