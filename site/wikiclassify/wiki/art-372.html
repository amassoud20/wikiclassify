				<span class='text'>His main discoveries include those of [[electromagnetic induction]], [[diamagnetism]] and [[electrolysis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough Faraday received little formal education, he was one of the most influential scientists in history</span>
				<span class='text'>It was by his research on the [[electromagnetic field|magnetic field]] around a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] carrying a [[direct current]] that Faraday established the basis for the concept of the electromagnetic field in physics</span>
				<span class='text'>Faraday also established that [[magnetism]] could affect [[Ray (optics)|rays of light]] and that there was an underlying relationship between the two phenomena</span>

				<span class='text'>His [[invention]]s of [[electric motor|electromagnetic rotary devices]] formed the foundation of electric motor technology, and it was largely due to his efforts that [[electricity]] became practical for use in technology</span>
				<span class='text'>s a chemist, Faraday discovered [[benzene]], investigated the [[clathrate hydrate]] of chlorine, invented an early form of the [[Bunsen burner]] and the system of [[oxidation number]]s, and popularised terminology such as [[anode]], [[cathode]], [[electrode]], and [[ion]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Faraday ultimately became the first and foremost [[Fullerian Professor of Chemistry]] at the [[Royal Institution of Great Britain]], a lifetime position</span>
				<span class='text'>araday was an excellent experimentalist who conveyed his ideas in clear and simple language; his mathematical abilities, however, did not extend as far as trigonometry or any but the simplest algebra</span>
				<span class='text'>[[James Clerk Maxwell]] took the work of Faraday and others, and summarized it in a set of equations that is accepted as the basis of all modern theories of electromagnetic phenomena</span>
				<span class='text'>On Faraday's uses of the [[lines of force]], Maxwell wrote that they show Faraday &quot;to have been in reality a mathematician of a very high order – one from whom the mathematicians of the future may derive valuable and fertile methods</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|Portrait of Faraday in his late thirties]]In 1812, at the age of twenty, and at the end of his apprenticeship, Faraday attended lectures by the eminent English chemist [[Humphry Davy]] of the [[Royal Institution]] and [[Royal Society]], and [[John Tatum (scientist)|John Tatum]], founder of the City Philosophical Society</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of the tickets for these lectures were given to Faraday by [[William Dance]], who was one of the founders of the [[Royal Philharmonic Society]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Faraday subsequently sent Davy a three-hundred-page book based on notes that he had taken during these lectures</span>
				<span class='text'>Davy's reply was immediate, kind, and favourable</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1813, when Davy damaged his eyesight in an accident with [[nitrogen trichloride]], he decided to employ Faraday as an assistant</span>
				<span class='text'>Coincidentally one of the Royal Institution's assistants, John Payne, was sacked, and Sir Humphry Davy was asked to find a replacement; thus he appointed Faraday as Chemical Assistant at the Royal Institution on 1 March 1813</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;EncBrit&quot;/&gt; Very soon Davy entrusted Faraday with preparation of nitrogen trichloride samples, and they both became injured in an explosion of this very sensitive substance</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p</span>
				<span class='text'>17&lt;/ref&gt;In the class-based English society of the time, Faraday was not considered a gentleman</span>
				<span class='text'>When Davy set out on a long tour of the continent in 1813–15, his [[valet]] did not wish to go</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, Faraday went as Davy's scientific assistant, and was asked to act as Davy's valet until a replacement could be found in Paris</span>
				<span class='text'>Faraday was forced to fill the role of valet as well as assistant throughout the trip</span>
				<span class='text'>Davy's wife, Jane Apreece, refused to treat Faraday as an equal (making him travel outside the coach, eat with the servants, etc</span>
				<span class='text'>, and made Faraday so miserable that he contemplated returning to England alone and giving up science altogether</span>
				<span class='text'>The trip did, however, give him access to the scientific elite of Europe and exposed him to a host of stimulating ideas</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;]]In 1821, soon after the Danish physicist and chemist [[Hans Christian Ørsted]] discovered the phenomenon of [[electromagnetism]], Davy and British scientist [[William Hyde Wollaston]] tried, but failed, to design an [[electric motor]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;IEEUK&quot;/&gt; Faraday, having discussed the problem with the two men, went on to build two devices to produce what he called &quot;electromagnetic rotation&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>One of these, now known as the [[homopolar motor]], caused a continuous circular motion that was engendered by the circular magnetic force around a wire that extended into a pool of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] wherein was placed a magnet; the wire would then rotate around the magnet if supplied with current from a chemical battery</span>
				<span class='text'>These experiments and inventions formed the foundation of modern electromagnetic technology</span>
				<span class='text'>In his excitement, Faraday published results without acknowledging his work with either Wollaston or Davy</span>
				<span class='text'>The resulting controversy within the [[Royal Society]] strained his mentor relationship with Davy and may well have contributed to Faraday's assignment to other activities, which consequently prevented his involvement in electromagnetic research for several years</span>

				<span class='text'>231–3</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;From his initial discovery in 1821, Faraday continued his laboratory work, exploring electromagnetic properties of materials and developing requisite experience</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1824, Faraday briefly set up a circuit to study whether a magnetic field could regulate the flow of a current in an adjacent wire, but he found no such relationship</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[#Thompson|Thompson]], p</span>

				<span class='text'>95–98</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  In his spare time, Faraday continued publishing his experimental work on optics and electromagnetism; he conducted correspondence with scientists whom he had met on his journeys across Europe with Davy, and who were also working on electromagnetism</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Faraday's initial induction lab work occurred in late November 1825</span>

				<span class='text'>235–44</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Two years after the death of Davy, in 1831, he began his great series of experiments in which he discovered [[electromagnetic induction]], recording in his laboratory diary on 28 October 1831 he was; &quot;making many experiments with the great magnet of the Royal Society&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The iron ring-coil apparatus is still on display at the Royal Institution</span>
				<span class='text'>In subsequent experiments, he found that if he moved a magnet through a loop of wire an electric current flowed in that wire</span>
				<span class='text'>The current also flowed if the loop was moved over a stationary magnet</span>
				<span class='text'>His demonstrations established that a changing magnetic field produces an electric field; this relation was modelled mathematically by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] as [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]], which subsequently became one of the four [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell equations]], and which have in turn evolved into the generalization known today as [[Field theory (physics)|field theory]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Faraday would later use the principles he had discovered to construct the electric [[Electrical generator#Dynamo|dynamo]], the ancestor of modern power generators and the electric motor</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1832, he completed a series of experiments aimed at investigating the fundamental nature of electricity; Faraday used &quot;[[Electrostatics|static]]&quot;, [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]], and &quot;[[Bioelectromagnetism|animal electricity]]&quot; to produce the phenomena of electrostatic attraction, [[electrolysis]], [[Electromagnetism|magnetism]], etc</span>
				<span class='text'>He concluded that, contrary to the scientific opinion of the time, the divisions between the various &quot;kinds&quot; of electricity were illusory</span>
				<span class='text'>Faraday instead proposed that only a single &quot;electricity&quot; exists, and the changing values of quantity and intensity (current and voltage) would produce different groups of phenomena</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;IEEUK&quot;/&gt;Near the end of his career, Faraday proposed that electromagnetic forces extended into the empty space around the conductor</span>
				<span class='text'>This idea was rejected by his fellow scientists, and Faraday did not live to see the eventual acceptance of his proposition by the scientific community</span>
				<span class='text'>Faraday's concept of lines of flux emanating from charged bodies and magnets provided a way to visualize electric and magnetic fields; that conceptual model was crucial for the successful development of the electromechanical devices that dominated engineering and industry for the remainder of the 19th century</span>
