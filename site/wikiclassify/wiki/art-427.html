				<span class='text'> Succeeding [[Pope John XXIII]], he continued the [[Second Vatican Council]] which he closed in 1965, implementing its numerous reforms, and fostered improved ecumenical relations with [[Eastern Orthodox Christianity|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Protestant churches|Protestants]], which resulted in many historic meetings and agreements</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[Catholic Church and ecumenism#Since the Second Vatican Council]]&lt;/ref&gt; Montini served in the [[Secretariat of State (Holy See)|Vatican's Secretariat of State]] from 1922 to 1954</span>
				<span class='text'>While in the Secretariat of State, Montini and [[Domenico Tardini]] were considered as the closest and most influential colleagues of [[Pope Pius XII]], who in 1954 named him [[Archbishop of Milan]], the largest Italian diocese</span>
				<span class='text'>Montini automatically became the Secretary of the Italian Bishops Conference</span>
				<span class='text'>John XXIII elevated him to the [[College of Cardinals]] in 1958, and after the death of John XXIII, Montini was considered one of his most likely successors</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn| Hebblethwaite|1993|pp=322–23}}Upon his election to the papacy, Montini took the pontifical name '''Paul VI''' (the first to take the name &quot;Paul&quot; since [[Pope Paul V|1605]]) to indicate a renewed worldwide mission to spread the message of Christ</span>
				<span class='text'>He re-convened the Second Vatican Council, which was automatically closed with the death of John XXIII, and gave it priority and direction</span>
				<span class='text'>After the council had concluded its work, Paul VI took charge of the interpretation and implementation of its mandates, often walking a thin line between the conflicting expectations of various groups within Catholicism</span>
				<span class='text'>The magnitude and depth of the reforms affecting all fields of Church life during his pontificate exceeded similar reform policies of his predecessors and successors</span>
				<span class='text'>Paul VI was a [[Mariology|Marian]] devotee, speaking repeatedly to Marian congresses and [[Roman Catholic Mariology|mariological]] meetings, visiting Marian shrines and issuing three [[Mariology of Pope Paul VI|Marian encyclicals]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Following his famous predecessor [[Ambrose of Milan|Saint Ambrose of Milan]], he named Mary as the [[Mother of the Church]] during the Second Vatican Council</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|135px|thumb|left|His father, Giorgio Montini]]Giovanni Battista Montini was born in the village of [[Concesio]], in the [[province of Brescia]], [[Lombardy]] in 1897</span>
				<span class='text'>His father Giorgio Montini was a lawyer, journalist, director of the [[Catholic Action]] and member of the Italian Parliament</span>
				<span class='text'>His mother was Giudetta Alghisi, from a family of rural nobility</span>
				<span class='text'>He had two brothers, Francesco Montini, who became a physician, and Lodovico Montini, who became a lawyer and politician</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn| Lazzarini|1964|pp=20–21}}  On 30 September 1897, he was baptized in the name of Giovanni Battista Enrico Antonio Maria Montini</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Lazzarini|1964|p=19}} He attended ''Cesare Arici'', a school run by the [[Jesuits]], and in 1916, he received a diploma from ''[[Arnaldo da Brescia]]'', a public school in [[Brescia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His education was often interrupted by bouts of illness</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1916, he entered the [[seminary]] to become a Roman Catholic priest</span>
				<span class='text'>He was ordained priest on 29 May 1920 in Brescia and celebrated his first [[Holy Mass]] in Brescia in the [[Santa Maria delle Grazie, Brescia|Basilica of Santa Maria delle Grazie]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Lazzarini|1964|p=26}} Montini concluded his studies in [[Milan]] with a doctorate in [[Canon Law]] in the same year</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Franzen|1988|p=419}} Afterwards he studied at the [[Gregorian University]], the [[University of Rome La Sapienza]] and, at the request of [[Giuseppe Pizzardo]] at the ''[[Accademia dei Nobili Ecclesiastici]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>At the age of twenty-five, again at the request of Giuseppe Pizzardo, Montini entered the Secretariat of State in 1922, where he worked under Pizzardo together with [[Francesco Borgongini-Duca]], [[Alfredo Ottaviani]], [[Carlo Grano]], [[Domenico Tardini]] and [[Francis Spellman]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Lazzarini|1964|p=31}}  Consequently, he spent not a day as a parish priest</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1925 he helped found the publishing house Morcelliana in Brescia, focused on promoting a 'Christian inspired culture'</span>

				<span class='text'>Like [[Achille Ratti]] before him,{{Efn|Nuncio Ratti was asked by the authorities to leave Poland as Nuncio</span>
				<span class='text'>} he felt confronted with the huge problem, not limited to Poland, of excessive [[nationalism]]: &quot;This form of nationalism treats foreigners as enemies, especially foreigners with whom one has common frontiers</span>
				<span class='text'>Then one seeks the expansion of one's own country at the expense of the immediate neighbours</span>
				<span class='text'>People grow up with a feeling of being hemmed in</span>
				<span class='text'>Peace becomes a transient compromise between wars</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{Sfn|Fappani|Molinari|Montini|1979 |p=404}} When he was recalled to Rome he was happy to go, because &quot;this concludes this episode of my life, which has provided useful, though not always joyful, experiences</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{Sfn|Fappani|Molinari|Montini|1979|p=265}}After his Polish mission, Giovanni Battista Montini returned to Rome, where soon he began to work in the Vatican</span>
				<span class='text'>Later, as pope, he wanted to return to Poland on a Marian pilgrimage, but he was not permitted by the Communist government, a request that it later could not deny to the native son Karol Wojtyla, who became [[Pope John Paul II]]</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|175px|Montini on the day of his ordination in 1920</span>
				<span class='text'>]His organisational skills led him to a career in the [[Roman Curia]], the papal civil service</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1931, Pacelli appointed him to teach history at the Papal Academy for Diplomats{{Sfn|Franzen|1988|p=419}}  In 1937, after his mentor Giuseppe Pizzardo was named a cardinal and was succeeded by [[Domenico Tardini]], Montini was named ''Substitute for Ordinary Affairs'' under Cardinal Pacelli, the Secretary of State under Pope Pius XI</span>
				<span class='text'>From Pius XI, whom he viewed with awe, he adopted the view, that ''learning is a life long process, and that history was the magister vitae teacher of life''{{Sfn| Hebblethwaite|1993|p=118}}  His immediate supervisor in the Vatican was [[Domenico Tardini]], with whom he got along well</span>
				<span class='text'>The election of Pacelli to the papacy in 1939, anticipated by everybody and openly promoted by [[Pope Pius XI]] in his last years, was a good omen for Montini, whose position was confirmed in the position under the new Cardinal Secretary of State [[Luigi Maglione]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He met the pope every morning until 1954 and thus developed a rather close relationship:{{Quote|It is true, my service to the pope was not limited to the political or extra-ordinary affairs according to Vatican language</span>
				<span class='text'>The goodness of Pope Pius XII opened to me the opportunity to look into the thoughts even into the soul of this great pontiff</span>
				<span class='text'> I could quote many details how Pius XII, always using measured and moderate speech, was hiding, nay revealing a noble position of great strength and fearless courage</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn| Lazzarini|1964|p=58}}}}As war broke out, Maglione, Tardini and Montini were the main figures in the Vatican's State Department, as despatches originated from or addressed to them during the war years</span>

				<span class='text'>In the afternoon he moved to the third floor into the Office of the Private Secretary of the Pontiff</span>
				<span class='text'>Pius XII did not have a personal secretary</span>
				<span class='text'>As did several popes before him, he delegated the secretarial functions to the State Secretariat</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Lazzarini|1964|p=57}}  During the war years, thousands of letters from all parts of the world arrived at the desk of the pope, most of them asking for understanding, prayer and help</span>
				<span class='text'>Montini was tasked to formulate the replies in the name of Pius XII, expressing his empathy, and understanding and providing help, where possible</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Lazzarini|1964|p=57}} At the request of the pope, he created an information office for prisoners of war and refugees, which in the years of its existence from 1939 until 1947 received almost ten million (9 891 497) information requests and produced over eleven million (11</span>
				<span class='text'>93</span>
				<span class='text'>11) answers about missing persons</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Pallenberg|1960|p=71}} Montini was several times openly attacked by [[Benito Mussolini]]'s government as a politician, and meddling in politics, but each time he found powerful defenses by the Vatican</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|[[James Hebblethwaite|Hebblethwaite]]|1993|p=155}} In 1944, [[Luigi Maglione]] died, and Pius XII appointed Tardini and Montini together as heads of the State Department</span>
				<span class='text'>Montini's admiration was almost filial, when he described Pope Pius XII:{{Quote|His richly cultivated mind, his unusual capacity for thought and study led him to avoid all distractions and every unnecessary relaxation</span>
				<span class='text'>He wished to enter fully into the history of his own afflicted time: with a deep understanding, that he was himself a part of that history</span>
				<span class='text'>He wished to participate fully in it, to share his sufferings in his own heart and soul</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Hebblethwaite|1993|p=195}}}}As Secretary of State Montini coordinated the activities of assistance to the persecuted hidden in convents, parishes, seminaries, and in ecclesiastical schools</span>

				<span class='text'>In Rome alone this organization distributed almost two million portions of free food in the year 1944</span>

				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Pallenberg|1960|p=72}} At the request of Pius XII, Montini was also involved in the re-establishment of Church Asylum, providing protection to hundreds of Allied soldiers, who had escaped from Axis prison camps, Jews, anti-Fascists, Socialists, Communists, and after the liberation of Rome, German soldiers, partisans and other displaced persons</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Pallenberg|1960|pp=72–73}} After the war and later as pope, Montini turned the Pontificia Commissione di Assistenza, into the major charity, ''Caritas Italiana''</span>

				<span class='text'>This encyclical was written in the wake of Vatican II, when the Catholic Church was questioning and revising many long-held practices</span>
				<span class='text'>Priestly celibacy is considered a [[discipline]] rather than [[dogma]], and some had expected that it might be relaxed</span>
				<span class='text'>In response to these questions, the Pope reaffirms the discipline as a long-held practice with special importance in the Catholic Church</span>
				<span class='text'>The encyclical ''Sacerdotalis caelibatus'' from 24 June 1967, confirms the traditional Church teaching, that celibacy is an ideal state and continues to be mandatory for Roman Catholic priests</span>
				<span class='text'>Celibacy symbolizes the reality of the kingdom of God amid modern society</span>
				<span class='text'>The priestly celibacy is closely linked to the sacramental priesthood</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Franzen 425&quot; /&gt;  However, during his pontificate Paul VI was considered generous in permitting bishops to grant laicization of priests who wanted to leave the sacerdotal state, a position which was drastically reversed by [[John Paul II]] in 1980 and cemented in the 1983 [[Canon Law]] that only the pope can in exceptional circumstances grant laicization</span>

				<span class='text'>They constitute a union of the loving couple with a loving God, in which the two persons create a new person materially, while God completes the creation by adding the soul</span>
				<span class='text'>For this reason, Paul VI teaches in the first sentence of ''[[Humanae vitae]]'' that the transmission of human life is a most serious role in which married people collaborate freely and responsibly with God the Creator</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Humanae vitae, 1&quot;&gt;{{Citation|title=Humanae vitae|at=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This divine partnership, according to Paul VI, does not allow for arbitrary human decisions, which may limit divine providence</span>
				<span class='text'>The Pope does not paint an overly romantic picture of marriage: marital relations are a source of great joy, but also of difficulties and hardships</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Humanae vitae, 1&quot; /&gt; The question of human procreation exceeds in the view of Paul VI specific disciplines such as [[biology]], [[psychology]], [[demography]] or [[sociology]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Humanae vitae|at=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this, according to Paul VI, is that married love takes its origin from God, who &quot;is love&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>From this basic dignity, he defines his position:{{quote |Love is total—that very special form of personal friendship in which husband and wife generously share everything, allowing no unreasonable exceptions and not thinking solely of their own convenience</span>
				<span class='text'>Whoever really loves his partner loves not only for what he receives, but loves that partner for the partner's own sake, content to be able to enrich the other with the gift of himself</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Humanae vitae | at = 8–9}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;}}The reaction to the encyclical's continued prohibitions of artificial birth control was very mixed</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Herder Korrespondenz Orbis Catholicus | year = 1968}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In Latin America, much support developed for the Pope and his encyclical</span>
				<span class='text'>As World Bank President [[Robert McNamara]] declared at the 1968 [[Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group|Annual Meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group]] that countries permitting birth control practices would get preferential access to resources, doctors in [[La Paz]], Bolivia called it insulting that money should be exchanged for the conscience of a Catholic nation</span>
				<span class='text'>In Colombia, Cardinal archbishop [[Aníbal Muñoz Duque]] declared, if American conditionality undermines Papal teachings, we prefer not to receive one cent</span>

				<span class='text'>The separated brothers and sisters, as he called them, were not able to contribute to the Council as invited observers</span>
				<span class='text'>After the Council, many of them took initiative to seek out their Catholic counterparts and the Pope in Rome, who welcomed such visits</span>
				<span class='text'>But the Catholic Church itself recognized from the many previous ecumenical encounters, that much needed to be done within, to be an open partner for ecumenism</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Schmidt|pp=811–12}} To those who are entrusted the highest and deepest truth and therefore, so Paul VI, believed that he had the most difficult part to communicate</span>
				<span class='text'>Ecumenical dialogue, in the view of Paul VI, requires from a Catholic the whole person: one's entire reason, will, and heart</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Guitton|1967|p=177}} Paul VI, like Pius XII before him, was reluctant to give in on a lowest possible point</span>
				<span class='text'>And yet, Paul felt compelled to admit his ardent Gospel-based desire to be everything to everybody and to help all people{{Sfn|Guitton|1967|p=181}} Being the successor of Peter, he felt the words of Christ, &quot;Do you love me more&quot; like a sharp knife penetrating to the marrow of his soul</span>
				<span class='text'>These words meant to Paul VI love without limits,{{Sfn|Guitton|1967|p=185}} and they underscore the Church's fundamental approach to ecumenism</span>

				<span class='text'>He implemented the reforms of [[John XXIII]] and [[Vatican II]]</span>

				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt;On basic Church teachings, the pope was unwavering</span>
				<span class='text'>On the tenth anniversary of ''[[Humanae vitae]]'', he reconfirmed this teaching</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Graham&quot;&gt;{{Sfn|Graham|1983|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his style and methodology, he was a disciple of Pius XII, whom he deeply revered</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Graham&quot; /&gt; He suffered for the attacks on Pius XII for his alleged silences during the Holocaust</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Graham&quot; /&gt; Pope Paul VI was less outstanding than his predecessors: he was not credited with an encyclopedic memory, nor a gift for languages, nor the brilliant writing style of Pius XII,{{Sfn|Pallenberg|1960|p=107}} nor did he have the charisma and outpouring love, sense of humor and human warmth of John XXIII</span>
				<span class='text'>He took on himself the unfinished reform work of these two popes, bringing them diligently with great humility and common sense and without much fanfare to conclusion</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Graham|1983|p=76}} In doing so, Paul VI saw himself following in the footsteps of the Apostle Paul, torn to several directions as Saint Paul, who said,  &quot;I am attracted to two sides at once, because the Cross always divides</span>

				<span class='text'>]Unlike his predecessors and successors, Paul VI refused to excommunicate the opponents</span>
				<span class='text'>He admonished but did not punish those with other views</span>
				<span class='text'>The new theological freedoms which he fostered&amp;nbsp;resulted in a pluralism of opinions and uncertainties among the faithful</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Franzen|1991|p=389}}  New demands were voiced, which were taboo at the Council, the reintegration of divorced Catholics, the sacramental character of the confession, and the role of women in the Church and its ministries</span>
				<span class='text'>Conservatives complained, that &quot;women wanted to be priests, priests wanted to get married, bishops became regional popes and theologians claimed absolute teaching authority</span>
				<span class='text'>Protestants claimed equality, homosexuals and divorced called for full acceptance</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{Sfn|Martin| 1981|p=277}} Changes such as the [[Mass of Paul VI#Liturgical orientation|reorientation of the liturgy]], [[Mass of Paul VI#Changes in the Order of Mass|alterations to the ordinary of the Mass]], alterations to the [[Calendar of saints|liturgical calendar]] in the motu proprio ''[[Mysterii Paschalis]]'', and the [[Mass of Paul VI#Repositioning of the tabernacle|relocation of the tabernacle]] were controversial among some Catholics</span>
				<span class='text'>aul VI did renounce many traditional symbols of the papacy and the Catholic Church; some of his changes to the papal dress were reversed by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in the early 21st century</span>
				<span class='text'>Refusing a Vatican army of colourful military uniforms from centuries, he got rid of them</span>
				<span class='text'>He became the first pope to visit five continents</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Josef Schmitz van Vorst, 68&quot;&gt;Josef Schmitz van Vorst, 68&lt;/ref&gt; Paul VI systematically continued and completed the efforts of his predecessors, to turn the Euro-centric Church into a Church of the world, by integrating the bishops from all continents in its government and in the Synods which he convened</span>
				<span class='text'>His 6 August 1967 [[motu proprio]] ''Pro Comperto Sane'' opened the [[Roman Curia]] to the bishops of the world</span>
				<span class='text'>Until then, only Cardinals could be leading members of the Curia</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Josef Schmitz van Vorst, 68&quot; /&gt;Some critiqued Paul VI's decision; the newly created Synod of Bishops had an advisory role only and could not make decisions on their own, although the Council decided exactly that</span>
				<span class='text'>During the pontificate of Paul VI, five such synods took place, and he is on record of implementing all their decisions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Simmel, 80&lt;/ref&gt; Related questions were raised about the new National Bishop Conferences, which became mandatory after Vatican II</span>
				<span class='text'>Others questioned his Ostpolitik and contacts with Communism and the deals he engaged in for the faithful</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Simmel, 82&lt;/ref&gt;The pope clearly suffered from the responses within the Church to ''Humanae vitae''</span>
				<span class='text'>While most regions and bishops supported the pontiff, a small but important part of them especially in the Netherlands, Canada, and Germany openly disagreed with the pope, which deeply wounded him for the rest of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Simmel, 81&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Patrick O'Boyle]], the Cardinal Archbishop of Washington, DC, disciplined several priests for publicly dissenting from this teaching, the pope encouraged him</span>
