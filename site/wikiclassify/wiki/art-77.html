				<span class='text'>However Charlton credits much of the early development of his career to his grandfather Tanner and his mother Cissie</span>
				<span class='text'> His elder brother  initially went to work applying to the  before also becoming a professional footballer with Leeds United</span>
				<span class='text'>lub careerOn 9 February 1953 then a Bedlington Grammar School pupil Charlton was spotted playing for East Northumberland schools by  chief scout </span>
				<span class='text'> Charlton went on to play for England schoolboys and the 15 year old signed with United on 1 January 1953 along with  also aged 15</span>
				<span class='text'> Initially his mother was reluctant to let him commit to an insecure football career so he began an  as an electrical engineer however he went on to turn professional in October 1954</span>
				<span class='text'>Charlton became one of the famed  the collection of talented footballers who emerged through the system at  in the 1940s 1950s and 1960s as Matt Busby set about a long term plan of rebuilding the club after the </span>
				<span class='text'>He worked his way through the pecking order of teams scoring regularly for the youth and reserve sides before he was handed his first team debut against  in October 1956</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time he was doing his  with the  in  where Busby had advised him to apply as it meant he could still play for Manchester United at the weekend</span>
				<span class='text'>Also doing his army service in Shrewsbury at the same time was his United team mate </span>
				<span class='text'>harlton 2007 p</span>
				<span class='text'>0 Charlton played 14 times for United in that first season scoring twice on his debut and managing a total of 12 goals in all competitions and including a hat trick in a 5–1 away win over  in the February</span>
				<span class='text'>United won the  but were denied the 20th centurys first double when they controversially lost the  to </span>
				<span class='text'>Charlton still only 19 was selected for the game which saw United goalkeeper  carried off with a broken bone after a clash with Villa centre forward </span>
				<span class='text'>Though Charlton was a candidate to go in goal to replace Wood in the days before substitutes and certainly before goalkeeping substitutes it was teammate  who ended up between the posts</span>
				<span class='text'>harlton was an established player by the time the next season was fully underway which saw United as current League champions become the first English team to compete in the </span>
				<span class='text'>Previously  had scorned the competition but United made progress reaching the semi finals where they lost to holders </span>
				<span class='text'>Their reputation was further enhanced the next season as they reached the quarter finals to play </span>
				<span class='text'>In the first leg at home United won 2–1</span>
				<span class='text'>The return in  saw Charlton score twice as United stormed 3–0 ahead although the hosts came back to earn a 3–3 draw</span>
				<span class='text'>However United maintained their  lead to reach the last four and were in jubilant mood as they left to catch their flight home thinking of an important League game against  at the weekend</span>
				<span class='text'>he aeroplane which took the United players and staff home from  needed to stop in  to uel</span>
				<span class='text'>This was carried out in worsening weather and by the time the uelling was complete and the call was made for the passengers to re board the aircraft the wintry showers had taken hold and snow had settled heavily on the runway and around the airport</span>
				<span class='text'>There were two aborted take offs which led to concern on board and the passengers were advised by a stewardess to disembark again while a minor technical error was fixed</span>
				<span class='text'>he team was back in the airport terminal barely ten minutes when the call to reconvene on the plane came and a number of passengers began to feel nervous</span>
				<span class='text'>Charlton and teammate  swapped places with  and  who had decided they would be safer at the back of the plane</span>
				<span class='text'>he plane clipped the fence at the end of the runway on its next take off attempt and a wing tore through a nearby house setting it alight</span>
				<span class='text'>The wing and part of the tail came off and hit a tree and a wooden hut the plane spinning along the snow until coming to a halt</span>
				<span class='text'>It had been cut in half</span>
				<span class='text'>harlton strapped into his seat had fallen out of the cabin and when United goalkeeper  who had somehow got through a hole in the plane unscathed and begun a one man rescue mission found him he thought he was dead</span>
				<span class='text'>That said he grabbed both Charlton and Viollet by their trouser waistbands and dragged them away from the plane in constant fear that it would explode</span>
				<span class='text'>Gregg returned to the plane to try to help the appallingly injured Busby and Blanchflower and when he turned around again he was relieved to see that Charlton and Viollet both of whom he had presumed to be dead had got out of their detached seats and were looking into the wreckage</span>
				<span class='text'>harlton suffered cuts to his head and severe  and was in hospital for a week</span>
				<span class='text'>Seven of his teammates had perished at the scene including Taylor and Pegg with whom he and Viollet had swapped seats prior to the fatal take off attempt</span>
				<span class='text'>Club captain  was also killed along with    and </span>
				<span class='text'> died a fortnight later from the injuries he had sustained</span>
				<span class='text'>In total the crash claimed 23 lives</span>
				<span class='text'>Initially ice on the wings was blamed but a later inquiry declared that  on the runway had made a safe take off almost impossible</span>
				<span class='text'>f the 44 passengers and crew including the 17 strong Manchester United squad 23 people eight of them Manchester United players died as a result of their injures in the crash</span>
				<span class='text'>Charlton survived with minor injuries</span>
				<span class='text'>Of the eight other players who survived two of them were injured so badly that they never played again</span>
				<span class='text'>harlton was the first injured survivor to leave hospital</span>
				<span class='text'> and  were not hospitalized since they escaped uninjured</span>
				<span class='text'>He arrived back in England on 14 February 1958 eight days after the crash</span>
				<span class='text'>As he convalesced with family in Ashington he spent some time kicking a ball around with local youths and a famous photograph of him was taken</span>
				<span class='text'>He was still only 20 years old yet now there was an expectation that he would help with the rebuilding of the club as Busbys aides tried to piece together what remained of the season</span>
				<span class='text'>harlton returned to playing in an FA cup tie against West Bromwich Albion on 1 March the game was a draw and United won the replay 1–0</span>
				<span class='text'>Not unexpectedly United went out of the European Cup to  in the semi finals to a 5–2 aggregate defeat and fell behind in the League</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet somehow they reached their second consecutive FA Cup final and the big day at Wembley coincided with Busbys return to work</span>
				<span class='text'>However his words could not inspire a side which was playing on a nations goodwill and sentiment and  scored twice to give  side a 2–0 win</span>
				<span class='text'>urther success with Manchester United came at last when they beat  3–1 in the FA Cup final of 1963 with Charlton finally earning a winners medal in his third final</span>
				<span class='text'>Busbys post Munich rebuilding programme continued to progress with two League championships within three seasons with United taking the title in 1965 and 1967</span>
				<span class='text'>A successful though trophyless season with Manchester United had seen him take the honours of  and  into the competition</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1968 Manchester United reached the  ten seasons after Munich</span>
				<span class='text'>Even though other clubs had taken part in the competition in the intervening decade the team which got to this final was still the first English side to do so</span>
				<span class='text'>On a highly emotional night at Wembley Charlton scored twice in a 4–1 win after extra time against  and as United captain lifted the trophy</span>
				<span class='text'>uring the early 1970s Manchester United were no longer competing among the top teams in  and at several stages were battling against relegation</span>
				<span class='text'>At times Charlton was not on speaking terms with Uniteds other superstars  and  and Best used to play in Charltons testimonial match against  saying that to do so would be hypocritical</span>
				<span class='text'> Charlton left Manchester United at the end of the  having scored 249 goals and set a club record of 758 appearances a record which  broke in the </span>
				<span class='text'>is last game was against  at  on 28 April 1973 and before the game the BBC cameras for  captured the Chelsea chairman handing Charlton a commemorative cigarette case</span>
				<span class='text'>The match ended in a 1 0 defeat</span>
				<span class='text'> His final goal came a month earlier on 31 March in a 2 0 win at  also in the First Division</span>
				<span class='text'>International careerCharltons emergence as the countrys leading young football talent was completed when he was called up to join the  squad for a  game against  at  on 19 April 1958 just over two months after he had survived the Munich air disaster</span>
				<span class='text'>harlton was handed his debut as England romped home 4–0 with the new player gaining even more admirers after scoring a magnificent thumping volley dispatched with authority after a cross by the left winger </span>
				<span class='text'>He scored both goals in his second game as England beat  2–1 in a friendly at Wembley and overcame obvious nerves on a return to  to play his third match against </span>
				<span class='text'>England lost that game 5–0 and Charlton played poorly</span>
				<span class='text'>e was selected for the squad which competed at the  in  but did not kick a ball something at which critics expressed surprise and bewilderment even allowing for his lacklustre performance in Belgrade</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1959 he scored a  as England demolished the  8–1 and his second England hat trick came in 1961 in an 8–0 thrashing of </span>
				<span class='text'>He also managed to score in every  tournament he played in except  in an association with the tournament which lasted from 1958 to 1970 and included 16 goals and ten tournament victories five shared</span>
				<span class='text'>e played in qualifiers for the  in  against  and Portugal and was named in the squad for the finals themselves</span>
				<span class='text'>His goal in the 3–1 group win over  was his 25th for England in just 38 appearances and he was still only 24 years old but his individual success could not be replicated by that of the team which was eliminated in the quarter final by  who went on to win the tournament</span>
				<span class='text'>y now England were coached by  who had managed to gain sole control of the recruitment and team selection procedure from the  based call up system which had lasted up to the previous World Cup</span>
				<span class='text'>Ramsey had already cleared out some of the older players who had been reliant on the loyalty of the committee for their continued selection – it was well known that decorum on the pitch at club level had been just as big a factor in playing for England as ability and form</span>
				<span class='text'>Luckily for Charlton he had all three</span>
				<span class='text'> hat trick in the 8–1 rout of  in June 1963 took Charltons England goal tally to 30 equalling the  jointly held by  and  and Charltons 31st goal against  in October the same year gave him the record alone</span>
				<span class='text'>harltons role was developing from traditional inside forward to what today would be termed an attacking midfield player with Ramsey planning to build the team for the  around him</span>
				<span class='text'>When England beat the  10 0 in a friendly on 27 May 1964 he scored one goal his 33rd at senior level for England</span>
				<span class='text'>His goals became a little less frequent and indeed  playing purely as a striker would overtake Charltons England tally in October 1964</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless he was still scoring and creating freely and as the tournament was about to start he was expected to become one of its stars and galvanise his established reputation as one of the worlds best footballers</span>
				<span class='text'>ngland drew the opening game of the tournament 0–0 with Uruguay and Charlton scored the first goal in the 2–0 win over Mexico</span>
				<span class='text'>This was followed by an identical scoreline against  allowing England to qualify for the quarter finals</span>
				<span class='text'>ngland defeated Argentina 1–0 – the game was the only international match in which Charlton received a caution – and faced Portugal in the semi finals</span>
				<span class='text'>This turned out to be one of Charltons most important games for England</span>
				<span class='text'>harlton opened the scoring with a crisp side footed finish after a run by  had forced the Portuguese goalkeeper out of his net his second was a sweetly struck shot after a run and pull back from </span>
				<span class='text'>Charlton and Hunt were now Englands joint highest scorers in the tournament with three each and a final against  beckoned</span>
				<span class='text'>he final turned out to be one of Charltons quieter days he and a young  effectively marked each other out of the game</span>
				<span class='text'>England won 4–2 after extra time</span>
				<span class='text'>harltons next England game was his 75th as England beat  2 caps later and he had become Englands second most capped player behind the veteran  who was approaching his 100th appearance when Charlton was starting out and ended with 105 caps</span>
				<span class='text'>eeks later he scored his 45th England goal in a friendly against  breaking the record of 44 set the previous year by </span>
				<span class='text'>He was then in the England team which made it to the semi finals of the  where they were knocked out by Yugoslavia in </span>
				<span class='text'>During the match Charlton struck a Yugoslav post</span>
				<span class='text'>England defeated the  2–0 in the third place match</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1969 Charlton was awarded the  for services to football</span>
				<span class='text'>More milestones followed as he won his 100th England cap on 21 April 1970 against Northern Ireland and was made captain by Ramsey for the occasion</span>
				<span class='text'>Inevitably he scored</span>
				<span class='text'>This was his 48th goal for his country – his 49th and final goal would follow a month later in a 4–0 win over  during a warm up tour for the  designed to get the players adapted to altitude conditions</span>
				<span class='text'>Charltons inevitable selection by Ramsey for the tournament made him the first – and still to date only – England player to feature in four World Cup squads</span>
				<span class='text'>hortly before the World Cup Charlton was involved in the  incident in which he and Bobby Moore were accused of stealing a bracelet from a jewellery store</span>
				<span class='text'>Moore was later arrested and detained for four days before being granted a conditional release while Charlton was not arrested</span>
				<span class='text'>ngland began the tournament with two victories in the group stages plus a memorable defeat against Brazil</span>
				<span class='text'>Charlton played in all three though was substituted for  in the final game of the group against </span>
				<span class='text'>Ramsey confident of victory and progress to the quarter final wanted Charlton to rest</span>
				<span class='text'>ngland duly reached the last eight where they again faced West Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>Charlton controlled the midfield and suppressed s runs from deep as England coasted to a 2–0 lead</span>
				<span class='text'>Beckenbauer pulled a goal back for the Germans and Ramsey replaced the ageing and tired Charlton with  who further tested the German keeper  and also provided a great cross for  who uncharacteristically squandered the chance</span>
				<span class='text'>West Germany who had a habit of coming back from behind eventually scored twice – a back header from  made it 2–2</span>

				<span class='text'>England were out and after a record 106 caps and 49 goals Charlton decided to end his international career at the age of 32</span>
				<span class='text'>On the flight home from Mexico he asked Ramsey not to consider him again</span>
				<span class='text'>His brother Jack two years his senior but 71 caps his junior did likewise</span>
				<span class='text'>espite popular opinion the substitution did not change the game as Franz Beckenbauer had scored before Charlton left the field hence Charlton had failed to cancel out the German</span>
				<span class='text'>Charlton himself conceded that the substitution did not affect the game in a  documentary</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1984 he was invited to become member of the  at Manchester United partly because of his football knowledge and partly because it was felt that the club needed a name on the board after the resignation of </span>
