				<span class='text'>He played almost all of his club football at [[Manchester United F</span>

				<span class='text'>He was also well known for his fitness and stamina</span>

				<span class='text'>After helping United to win [[the Football League]] in 1965, he won a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] medal with [[England national football team|England]] in 1966 and another Football League title with United the following year</span>

				<span class='text'>However, Charlton credits much of the early development of his career to his grandfather Tanner and his mother Cissie</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Charlton|2007|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; His elder brother, [[Jack Charlton|Jack]], initially went to work applying to the [[police|Police Service]] before also becoming a professional footballer with Leeds United</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Charlton|2007|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;Charlton became one of the famed [[Busby Babes]], the collection of talented footballers who emerged through the system at [[Old Trafford]] in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s as Matt Busby set about a long-term plan of rebuilding the club after the [[Second World War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He worked his way through the pecking order of teams, scoring regularly for the youth and reserve sides before he was handed his first team debut against [[Charlton Athletic F</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Charlton Athletic]] in October 1956</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time, he was doing his [[National service]] with the [[Royal Army Ordnance Corps]] in [[Shrewsbury]], where Busby had advised him to apply as it meant he could still play for Manchester United at the weekend</span>
				<span class='text'>Also doing his army service in Shrewsbury at the same time was his United team-mate [[Duncan Edwards]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Charlton 2007, p</span>
				<span class='text'>0&lt;/ref&gt;Charlton played 14 times for United in that first season, scoring twice on his debut and managing a total of 12 goals in all competitions, and including a hat-trick in a 5–1 away win over [[Charlton Athletic F</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Charlton Athletic]] in the February</span>
				<span class='text'>United won the [[list of English football champions|league championship]] but were denied the 20th century's first &quot;double&quot; when they controversially lost the [[1957 FA Cup Final]] to [[Aston Villa F</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Aston Villa]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Charlton, still only 19, was selected for the game, which saw United goalkeeper [[Ray Wood]] carried off with a broken [[cheek]]bone after a clash with Villa centre forward [[Peter McParland]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Though Charlton was a candidate to go in goal to replace Wood (in the days before substitutes, and certainly before goalkeeping substitutes), it was teammate [[Jackie Blanchflower]] who ended up between the posts</span>
				<span class='text'>harlton was an established player by the time the next season was fully underway, which saw United, as current League champions, become the first English team to compete in the [[European Champion Clubs' Cup|European Cup]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Previously, [[the Football Association]] had scorned the competition but United made progress, reaching the semi-finals where they lost to holders [[Real Madrid C</span>

				<span class='text'>Real Madrid]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Their reputation was further enhanced the next season as they reached the quarter finals to play [[Red Star Belgrade]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In the first leg at home, United won 2–1</span>
				<span class='text'>The return in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] saw Charlton score twice as United stormed 3–0 ahead, although the hosts came back to earn a 3–3 draw</span>
				<span class='text'>However, United maintained their [[aggregate score|aggregate]] lead to reach the last four and were in jubilant mood as they left to catch their flight home, thinking of an important League game against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F</span>

				<span class='text'>==Munich air disaster==={{see also|Munich air disaster}}The aeroplane which took the United players and staff home from [[Zemun|Zemun Airport]] needed to stop in [[Munich]] to refuel</span>
				<span class='text'>This was carried out in worsening weather, and by the time the refuelling was complete and the call was made for the passengers to re-board the aircraft, the wintry showers had taken hold and snow had settled heavily on the runway and around the airport</span>
				<span class='text'>There were two aborted take-offs which led to concern on board, and the passengers were advised by a stewardess to disembark again while a minor technical error was fixed</span>
				<span class='text'>he team was back in the airport terminal barely ten minutes when the call to reconvene on the plane came, and a number of passengers began to feel nervous</span>
				<span class='text'>Charlton and teammate [[Dennis Viollet]] swapped places with [[Tommy Taylor]] and [[David Pegg]], who had decided they would be safer at the back of the plane</span>
				<span class='text'>he plane clipped the fence at the end of the runway on its next take-off attempt and a wing tore through a nearby house, setting it alight</span>
				<span class='text'>The wing and part of the tail came off and hit a tree and a wooden hut, the plane spinning along the snow until coming to a halt</span>
				<span class='text'>It had been cut in half</span>
				<span class='text'>harlton, strapped into his seat, had fallen out of the cabin and when United goalkeeper [[Harry Gregg]] (who had somehow got through a hole in the plane unscathed and begun a one-man rescue mission) found him, he thought he was dead</span>
				<span class='text'>That said, he grabbed both Charlton and Viollet by their trouser waistbands and dragged them away from the plane in constant fear that it would explode</span>
				<span class='text'>Gregg returned to the plane to try to help the appallingly injured Busby and Blanchflower, and when he turned around again, he was relieved to see that Charlton and Viollet, both of whom he had presumed to be dead, had got out of their detached seats and were looking into the wreckage</span>
				<span class='text'>harlton suffered cuts to his head and severe [[shock (circulatory)|shock]] and was in hospital for a week</span>
				<span class='text'>Seven of his teammates had perished at the scene, including Taylor and Pegg, with whom he and Viollet had swapped seats prior to the fatal take-off attempt</span>
				<span class='text'>Club captain [[Roger Byrne]] was also killed, along with [[Mark Jones (footballer, born 1933)|Mark Jones]], [[Liam Whelan|Billy Whelan]], [[Eddie Colman]] and [[Geoff Bent]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Duncan Edwards]] died a fortnight later from the injuries he had sustained</span>
				<span class='text'>In total, the crash claimed 23 lives</span>
				<span class='text'>Initially, ice on the wings was blamed, but a later inquiry declared that [[slush]] on the runway had made a safe take-off almost impossible</span>
				<span class='text'>f the 44 passengers and crew (including the 17-strong Manchester United squad), 23 people (eight of them Manchester United players) died as a result of their injures in the crash</span>
				<span class='text'>Charlton survived with minor injuries</span>
				<span class='text'>Of the eight other players who survived, two of them were injured so badly that they never played again</span>
				<span class='text'>harlton was the first injured survivor to leave hospital</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Harry Gregg]] and [[Bill Foulkes]] were not hospitalized since they escaped uninjured</span>
				<span class='text'>He arrived back in England on 14 February 1958, eight days after the crash</span>
				<span class='text'>As he convalesced with family in Ashington, he spent some time kicking a ball around with local youths, and a famous photograph of him was taken</span>
				<span class='text'>He was still only 20 years old, yet now there was an expectation that he would help with the rebuilding of the club as Busby's aides tried to piece together what remained of the season</span>
				<span class='text'>==Resuming his career===Charlton returned to playing in an FA cup tie against West Bromwich Albion on 1 March; the game was a draw and United won the replay 1–0</span>
				<span class='text'>Not unexpectedly, United went out of the European Cup to [[A</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Milan|Milan]] in the semi-finals to a 5–2 aggregate defeat and fell behind in the League</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet somehow they reached their second consecutive FA Cup final, and the big day at Wembley coincided with Busby's return to work</span>
				<span class='text'>However, his words could not inspire a side which was playing on a nation's goodwill and sentiment, and [[Nat Lofthouse]] scored twice to give [[Bolton Wanderers F</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Bolton Wanderers]] side a 2–0 win</span>
				<span class='text'>urther success with Manchester United came at last when they beat [[Leicester City F</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Leicester City]] 3–1 in the FA Cup final of 1963, with Charlton finally earning a winners' medal in his third final</span>
				<span class='text'>Busby's post-Munich rebuilding programme continued to progress with two League championships within three seasons, with United taking the title in 1965 and 1967</span>
				<span class='text'>A successful (though trophyless) season with Manchester United had seen him take the honours of ''[[Football Writers' Association|Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year]]'' and ''[[Ballon d'Or|European Footballer Of The Year]]'' into the competition</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1968, Manchester United reached the [[1968 European Cup Final|European Cup final]], ten seasons after Munich</span>
				<span class='text'>Even though other clubs had taken part in the competition in the intervening decade, the team which got to this final was still the first English side to do so</span>

				<span class='text'>uring the early 1970s, Manchester United were no longer competing among the top teams in [[Football in England|England]], and at several stages were battling against relegation</span>

				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|upright|Charlton on the cover of the [[Argentina|Argentinian]] sports magazine ''[[El Gráfico]]'', 27 June 1962]]Charlton's emergence as the country's leading young football talent was completed when he was called up to join the [[England national football team|England]] squad for a [[British Home Championship]] game against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] at [[Hampden Park]] on 19 April 1958, just over two months after he had survived the Munich air disaster</span>
				<span class='text'>harlton was handed his debut as England romped home 4–0, with the new player gaining even more admirers after scoring a magnificent thumping volley dispatched with authority after a cross by the left winger [[Tom Finney]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He scored both goals in his second game as England beat [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] 2–1 in a friendly at Wembley; and overcame obvious nerves on a return to [[Belgrade]] to play his third match against [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]]</span>

				<span class='text'>n 1959 he scored a [[hat-trick]] as England demolished the [[United States men's national soccer team|US]] 8–1; and his second England hat-trick came in 1961 in an 8–0 thrashing of [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also managed to score in every [[British Home Championship]] tournament he played in except [[1963 British Home Championship|1963]] in an association with the tournament which lasted from 1958 to 1970 and included 16 goals and ten tournament victories (five shared)</span>

				<span class='text'>His goal in the 3–1 group win over [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] was his 25th for England in just 38 appearances, and he was still only 24 years old, but his individual success could not be replicated by that of the team, which was eliminated in the quarter final by [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], who went on to win the tournament</span>

				<span class='text'>Ramsey had already cleared out some of the older players who had been reliant on the loyalty of the committee for their continued selection – it was well known that decorum on the pitch at club level had been just as big a factor in playing for England as ability and form</span>

				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, he was still scoring and creating freely and as the tournament was about to start, he was expected to become one of its stars and galvanise his established reputation as one of the world's best footballers</span>

				<span class='text'>harlton opened the scoring with a crisp side-footed finish after a run by [[Roger Hunt]] had forced the Portuguese goalkeeper out of his net; his second was a sweetly struck shot after a run and pull-back from [[Geoff Hurst]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Charlton and Hunt were now England's joint-highest scorers in the tournament with three each, and a final against [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] beckoned</span>
				<span class='text'>he final turned out to be one of Charlton's quieter days; he and a young [[Franz Beckenbauer]] effectively marked each other out of the game</span>
				<span class='text'>England won 4–2 after extra time</span>
				<span class='text'>==Euro 1968===Charlton's next England game was his 75th as England beat [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]]; 2 caps later and he had become England's second most-capped player, behind the veteran [[Billy Wright (footballer born 1924)|Billy Wright]], who was approaching his 100th appearance when Charlton was starting out and ended with 105 caps</span>
				<span class='text'>eeks later he scored his 45th England goal in a friendly against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]], breaking the record of 44 set the previous year by [[Jimmy Greaves]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was then in the England team which made it to the semi-finals of the [[UEFA Euro 1968|1968 European Championships]] where they were knocked out by Yugoslavia in [[Florence]]</span>
				<span class='text'>During the match Charlton struck a Yugoslav post</span>

				<span class='text'>More milestones followed as he won his 100th England cap on 21 April 1970 against Northern Ireland, and was made captain by Ramsey for the occasion</span>
				<span class='text'>Inevitably, he scored</span>
				<span class='text'>This was his 48th goal for his country – his 49th and final goal would follow a month later in a 4–0 win over [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] during a warm-up tour for the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]], designed to get the players adapted to altitude conditions</span>
				<span class='text'>Charlton's inevitable selection by Ramsey for the tournament made him the first – and still, to date, only – England player to feature in four World Cup squads</span>
				<span class='text'>==1970 World Cup===Shortly before the World Cup Charlton was involved in the [[Bogotá Bracelet]] incident in which he and Bobby Moore were accused of stealing a bracelet from a jewellery store</span>
				<span class='text'>Moore was later arrested and detained for four days before being granted a conditional release, while Charlton was not arrested</span>
				<span class='text'>ngland began the tournament with two victories in the group stages, plus a memorable defeat against Brazil</span>
				<span class='text'>Charlton played in all three, though was substituted for [[Alan Ball, Jr</span>
				<span class='text'>Alan Ball]] in the final game of the group against [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Ramsey, confident of victory and progress to the quarter final, wanted Charlton to rest</span>
				<span class='text'>ngland duly reached the last eight where they again faced West Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>Charlton controlled the midfield and suppressed [[Franz Beckenbauer]]'s runs from deep as England coasted to a 2–0 lead</span>
				<span class='text'>Beckenbauer pulled a goal back for the Germans and Ramsey replaced the ageing and tired Charlton with [[Colin Bell]] who further tested the German keeper [[Sepp Maier|Maier]] and also provided a great cross for [[Geoff Hurst]] who uncharacteristically squandered the chance</span>
				<span class='text'>West Germany, who had a habit of coming back from behind, eventually scored twice – a back header from [[Uwe Seeler]] made it 2–2</span>

				<span class='text'>England were out and, after a record 106 caps and 49 goals, Charlton decided to end his international career at the age of 32</span>
				<span class='text'>On the flight home from Mexico, he asked Ramsey not to consider him again</span>
				<span class='text'>His brother Jack, two years his senior but 71 caps his junior, did likewise</span>
				<span class='text'>espite popular opinion the substitution did not change the game as Franz Beckenbauer had scored before Charlton left the field, hence Charlton had failed to cancel out the German</span>
				<span class='text'>Charlton himself conceded that the substitution did not affect the game in a [[BBC]] documentary</span>
				<span class='text'>His [[Progression of England association football caps record|caps record]] lasted until 1973 when [[Bobby Moore]] overtook him, and Charlton currently lies seventh in the all-time England appearances list behind Moore, [[Wayne Rooney]], [[Ashley Cole]], [[Steven Gerrard]], [[David Beckham]] and [[Peter Shilton]], whose own England career began in the first game after Charlton's had ended</span>
				<span class='text'>Charlton's goalscoring record was surpassed by [[Wayne Rooney]] on 8 September 2015, when Rooney scored a [[penalty kick|penalty]] in a 2–0 win over Switzerland in a qualifying match for [[UEFA Euro 2016]]</span>
