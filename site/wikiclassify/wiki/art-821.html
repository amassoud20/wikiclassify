				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The social and political upheavals that characterised Athens in Solon's time have been variously interpreted by historians from ancient times to the present day</span>

				<span class='text'>a/english/florilegium/vol2/walters</span>
				<span class='text'>tml]&lt;/ref&gt; These different accounts provide a convenient basis for an overview of the issues involved</span>
				<span class='text'>'''Economic and ideological rivalry''' is a common theme in ancient sources</span>
				<span class='text'>This sort of account emerges from Solon's poems (e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>see below [[#Solon the reformer and poet|Solon the reformer and poet]]), in which he casts himself in the role of a noble mediator between two intemperate and unruly factions</span>
				<span class='text'>This same account is substantially taken up about three centuries later by the author of the Aristotelian ''[[Athenaion Politeia]]'' but with an interesting variation:&lt;br&gt;&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>here was conflict between the nobles and the common people for an extended period</span>
				<span class='text'>For the constitution they were under was oligarchic in every respect and especially in that the poor, along with their wives and children, were in slavery to the rich</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>ll the land was in the hands of a few</span>
				<span class='text'>And if men did not pay their rents, they themselves and their children were liable to be seized as slaves</span>
				<span class='text'>The security for all loans was the debtor's person up to the time of Solon</span>
				<span class='text'>He was the first people's champion</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Athenaion Politeia'' 2</span>
				<span class='text'>–2</span>
				<span class='text'> [[s:Athenian Constitution#2]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here Solon is presented as a partisan in a democratic cause whereas, judged from the viewpoint of his own poems, he was instead a mediator between rival factions</span>
				<span class='text'>A still more significant variation in the ancient historical account appears in the writing of Plutarch in the late 1st – early 2nd century AD:&lt;br&gt;&quot;Athens was torn by recurrent conflict about the constitution</span>
				<span class='text'>The city was divided into as many parties as there were geographical divisions in its territory</span>
				<span class='text'>For the party of the people of the hills was most in favour of democracy, that of the people of the plain was most in favour of oligarchy, while the third group, the people of the coast, which preferred a mixed form of constitution somewhat between the other two, formed an obstruction and prevented the other groups from gaining control</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;The new picture which emerged was one of strife between regional groups, united by local loyalties and led by wealthy landowners</span>
				<span class='text'>Their goal was control of the central government at Athens and with it dominance over their rivals from other districts of Attika</span>

				<span class='text'>tml]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regional factionalism was inevitable in a relatively large territory such as Athens possessed</span>
				<span class='text'>In most Greek city states, a farmer could conveniently reside in town and travel to and from his fields every day</span>
				<span class='text'>According to [[Thucydides]], on the other hand, most Athenians continued to live in rural settlements right up until the [[Peloponnesian War]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Attika in Solon's time seemed to be moving towards a similarly ugly solution with many citizens in danger of being reduced to the status of [[helots]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; According to this account, bonds of kinship rather than local loyalties were the decisive influence on events in archaic Athens</span>
				<span class='text'>An Athenian belonged not only to a [[phyle]] or tribe and one of its subdivisions, the [[phratry]] or brotherhood, but also to an extended family, clan or [[genos]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It has been argued that these interconnecting units of kinship reinforced a hierarchic structure with aristocratic clans at the top</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Thus rivalries between aristocratic clans could engage all levels of society irrespective of any regional ties</span>
				<span class='text'>In that case, the struggle between rich and poor was the struggle between powerful aristocrats and the weaker affiliates of their rivals or perhaps even with their own rebellious affiliates</span>
				<span class='text'>he historical account of Solon's Athens has evolved over many centuries into a set of contradictory stories or a complex story that might be interpreted in a variety of ways</span>

				<span class='text'> [[s:Lives (Dryden translation)/Solon#25]]&lt;/ref&gt; but today the only records we have of Solon's laws are fragmentary quotes and comments in literary sources such as those written by [[Plutarch]] himself</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, the language of his laws was archaic even by the standards of the fifth century and this caused interpretational problems for ancient commentators</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Andrews A</span>
				<span class='text'>''Greek Society'' (Penguin 1967) 114, 201&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars doubt the reliability of these sources and our knowledge of Solon's legislation is therefore actually very limited in its details</span>

				<span class='text'>==Constitutional reform==={{main|Solonian Constitution}}Before Solon's reforms, the Athenian state was administered by nine [[archons]] appointed or elected annually by the [[Areopagus]] on the basis of noble birth and wealth</span>

				<span class='text'> [[s:Athenian Constitution#8]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Areopagus comprised former archons and it therefore had, in addition to the power of appointment, extraordinary influence as a consultative body</span>
				<span class='text'>The nine archons took the oath of office while ceremonially standing on a stone in the [[agora]], declaring their readiness to dedicate a golden statue if they should ever be found to have violated the laws</span>

				<span class='text'> [[s:Lives (Dryden translation)/Solon#25]]&lt;/ref&gt; There was an assembly of Athenian citizens (the [[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|Ekklesia]]) but the lowest class (the [[Thetes]]) was not admitted and its deliberative procedures were controlled by the nobles</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>''Athenian Politics c800–500BC: A Sourcebook'', Routledge, London (1991), page 35, note 2&lt;/ref&gt; There therefore seemed to be no means by which an archon could be called to account for breach of oath unless the Areopagus favoured his prosecution</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to the ''[[Athenian Constitution]]'', Solon legislated for all citizens to be admitted into the Ekklesia&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;''Athenaion Politeia'' 7</span>
				<span class='text'> [[s:Athenian Constitution#7]]&lt;/ref&gt; and for a court (the [[Heliaia]]) to be formed from all the citizens</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Aristotle ''Politics'' 1274a 3, 1274a 15&lt;/ref&gt; The Heliaia appears to have been the Ekklesia, or some representative portion of it, sitting as a jury</span>

				<span class='text'> [[s:Lives (Dryden translation)/Solon#24]]&lt;/ref&gt;*Competitiveness of Athenian commerce was promoted through revision of weights and measures, possibly based on successful standards already in use elsewhere, such as [[Aegina]] or [[Euboia]]&lt;ref&gt;V</span>

				<span class='text'>There were irregularities in the new governmental procedures, elected officials sometimes refused to stand down from their posts and occasionally important posts were left vacant</span>

				<span class='text'>-4 [[s:Lives (Dryden translation)/Solon#3]]&lt;/ref&gt; however, Solon originally wrote poetry for amusement, discussing pleasure in a popular rather than philosophical way</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Oxford Classical Dictionary (1964) ''Solon''&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote iambic and trochaic verses which, according to one modern scholar,&lt;ref&gt;David</span>

				<span class='text'>Campbell, ''Greek Lyric Poetry'', Bristol Classical Press 1982, Intro</span>
				<span class='text'>xxix&lt;/ref&gt; are more lively and direct than his elegies and possibly paved the way for the iambics of Athenian drama</span>
				<span class='text'>olon's verses are mainly significant for historical rather than aesthetic reasons, as a personal record of his reforms and attitudes</span>

				<span class='text'>''Greek Society'' (Penguin 1981) 114&lt;/ref&gt; According to Solon the poet, Solon the reformer was a voice for political moderation in [[Athens]] at a time when his fellow citizens were increasingly polarized by social and economic differences:&lt;blockquote&gt;πολλοὶ γὰρ πλουτεῦσι κακοί, ἀγαθοὶ δὲ πένονται:&lt;br&gt;ἀλλ' ἡμεῖς αὐτοῖς οὐ διαμειψόμεθα&lt;br&gt;τῆς ἀρετῆς τὸν πλοῦτον: ἐπεὶ τὸ μὲν ἔμπεδον αἰεί,&lt;br&gt;χρήματα δ' ἀνθρώπων ἄλλοτε ἄλλος ἔχει</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;br&gt;Some wicked men are rich, some good are poor;&lt;br&gt;We will not change our virtue for their store:&lt;br&gt;Virtue's a thing that none can take away,&lt;br&gt;But money changes owners all the day</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated5&quot;&gt;Plutarch ''Solon'' 1 [[s:Lives (Dryden translation)/Solon#1]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Here translated by the English poet [[John Dryden]], Solon's words define a 'moral high ground' where differences between rich and poor can be reconciled or maybe just ignored</span>
				<span class='text'>His poetry indicates that he attempted to use his extraordinary legislative powers to establish a peaceful settlement between the country's rival factions:&lt;blockquote&gt;{{lang|grc|    ἔστην δ' ἀμφιβαλὼν κρατερὸν σάκος ἀμφοτέροισι:&lt;br&gt;    νικᾶν δ' οὐκ εἴασ' οὐδετέρους ἀδίκως</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;br&gt;    Formerly they boasted of me vainly; with averted eyes&lt;br&gt;    Now they look askance upon me; friends no more but enemies</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Plutarch ''Solon'' 16 [[s:Lives (Dryden translation)/Solon#16]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Solon gave voice to Athenian 'nationalism', particularly in the city state's struggle with [[Megara]], its neighbour and rival in the Saronic Gulf</span>
				<span class='text'>Plutarch professes admiration of Solon's elegy urging Athenians to recapture the island of [[Salamis Island|Salamis]] from Megarian control</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated6&quot;&gt;Plutarch ''Solon'' 8 [[s:Lives (Dryden translation)/Solon#8]]&lt;/ref&gt; The same poem was said by [[Diogenes Laërtius]] to have stirred Athenians more than any other verses that Solon wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;    Let us go to Salamis to fight for the island&lt;br&gt;    We desire, and drive away our bitter shame!&lt;ref&gt;Solon, quoted in Diogenes Laërtius 1</span>
				<span class='text'>7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; It is possible that Solon  backed up this poetic bravado with true valour on the battlefield</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated7&quot;&gt;Plutarch ''Solon'' 9 [[s:Lives (Dryden translation)/Solon#9]]&lt;/ref&gt;==Solon and Athenian sexuality==As a regulator of Athenian society, Solon, according to some authors, also formalized its sexual mores</span>
				<span class='text'>According to a surviving fragment from a work (&quot;Brothers&quot;) by the comic playwright Philemon,&lt;ref&gt;Fr</span>
				<span class='text'>4&lt;/ref&gt; Solon established publicly funded brothels at Athens in order to &quot;democratize&quot; the availability of sexual pleasure</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Rachel Adams, David Savran, ''The Masculinity Studies Reader;'' Blackwell, 2002; p</span>
				<span class='text'>4&lt;/ref&gt; While the veracity of this comic account is open to doubt, at least one modern author considers it significant that in Classical Athens, three hundred or so years after the death of Solon, there existed a discourse that associated his reforms with an increased availability of heterosexual pleasure</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;One Hundred Years of Homosexuality: And Other Essays on Greek Love,'' p</span>
				<span class='text'>01&lt;/ref&gt;Ancient authors also say that Solon regulated [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|pederastic relationships]] in Athens; this has been presented as an adaptation of custom to the new structure of the ''polis''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bernard Sergent, &quot;Paederasty and Political Life in Archaic Greek Cities&quot; in ''Gay Studies from the French Culture;'' Harrington Park Press, Binghamton, NY 1993; pp</span>
				<span class='text'>53–154&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Eros and Greek Athletics'' By Thomas Francis Scanlon, p</span>
				<span class='text'>13 &quot;So it is clear that Solon was responsible for institutionalizing pederasty to some extent at Athens in the early sixth century</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt; According to various authors, ancient lawgivers (and therefore Solon by implication) drew up a set of laws that were intended to promote and safeguard the institution of pederasty and to control abuses against freeborn boys</span>
				<span class='text'>In particular, the orator Aeschines cites laws excluding slaves from wrestling halls and forbidding them to enter pederastic relationships with the sons of citizens</span>

				<span class='text'>Adcock)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Besides the alleged legislative aspect of Solon's involvement with pederasty, there were also suggestions of personal involvement</span>
				<span class='text'>According to some ancient authors Solon had taken the future tyrant Peisistratos as his [[eromenos]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Aristotle, writing around 330 BC, attempted to refute that belief, claiming that &quot;those are manifestly talking nonsense who pretend that Solon was the lover of Peisistratos, for their ages do not admit of it,&quot; as Solon was about thirty years older than Peisistratos</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], ''The Athenian Constitution,'' 2</span>
				<span class='text'>7&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the tradition persisted</span>
				<span class='text'>Four centuries later Plutarch ignored Aristotle's skepticism&lt;ref&gt;''Homosexuality &amp; Civilization'' By Louis Crompton, p</span>
				<span class='text'>25&lt;/ref&gt; and recorded the following anecdote, supplemented with his own conjectures:&lt;blockquote&gt;And they say Solon loved [Peisistratos]; and that is the reason, I suppose, that when afterwards they differed about the government, their enmity never produced any hot and violent passion, they remembered their old kindnesses, and retained &quot;Still in its embers living the strong fire&quot; of their love and dear affection</span>

				<span class='text'>John Dryden [[s:Lives (Dryden translation)/Solon]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;A century after Plutarch, [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]] also said that Peisistratos had been Solon's ''eromenos''</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite its persistence, however, it is not known whether the account is historical or fabricated</span>
				<span class='text'>It has been suggested that the tradition presenting a peaceful and happy coexistence between Solon and Peisistratos was cultivated during the latter's dominion, in order to legitimize his own rule, as well as that of his sons</span>
				<span class='text'>Whatever its source, later generations lent credence to the narrative</span>

				<span class='text'>272 n</span>
				<span class='text'>24&lt;/ref&gt; Solon's presumed pederastic desire was thought in antiquity to have found expression also in his poetry, which is today represented only in a few surviving fragments</span>

				<span class='text'>475&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nick Fisher, ''Against Timarchos,'' Oxford University Press 2001, p</span>
				<span class='text'>37&lt;/ref&gt;  The authenticity of all the poetic fragments attributed to Solon is however uncertain – in particular, pederastic aphorisms ascribed by some ancient sources to Solon have been ascribed by other sources to [[Theognis]] instead</span>
