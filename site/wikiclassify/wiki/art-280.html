				<span class='text'>He travelled to New York City where he took odd jobs while trying to write</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Benson&quot;/&gt;When their money ran out six months later due to the market being slow, Steinbeck and Carol moved back to [[Pacific Grove, California]], to a cottage owned by his father, on the [[Monterey Peninsula]] a few blocks outside the [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] city limits</span>
				<span class='text'>The elder Steinbecks gave John free housing,  paper for his manuscripts, and from 1928,  loans that allowed him to write without looking for work</span>
				<span class='text'>During the [[Great Depression]] period, Steinbeck bought a small boat, and later claimed that he was able to live on the fish and crab that he gathered from the sea, as well as fresh vegetables from his garden and local farms</span>
				<span class='text'>When that didn't work, Steinbeck and his wife were not above getting welfare, or rarely even stealing bacon from the local produce market</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Benson&quot;/&gt; Whatever food they had, they would share with their friends</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Benson&quot;/&gt; Carol became the model for Mary Talbot in Steinbeck's novel [[Cannery Row]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Benson&quot;/&gt;In 1930, Steinbeck met [[Ed Ricketts]], who became a close friend and mentor to Steinbeck during the following decade, teaching him a great deal about philosophy and biology</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Benson&quot;/&gt; Ricketts, usually very quiet, yet likable, with an inner self-sufficiency and an encyclopedic knowledge of diverse subjects, became a focus of Steinbeck's attention</span>
				<span class='text'>Ricketts had taken a college class from [[Warder C</span>
				<span class='text'>Allee]], a biologist and ecological theorist, who would go on to write a classic early textbook on [[ecology]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Ricketts became a proponent of ecological thinking, in which man was only one part of a great chain of being, caught in a web of life too large for him to control or understand</span>

				<span class='text'>It centers on Morgan's assault and sacking of the city of [[Panama]], sometimes referred to as the 'Cup of Gold', and on the women, fairer than the sun, who were said to be found there</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bio&quot;/&gt;After ''Cup of Gold'', between 1930 and 1933 Steinbeck produced three shorter works</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[The Pastures of Heaven]]'', published in 1932, consists of twelve interconnected stories about a valley near Monterey, which was discovered by a Spanish [[corporal]] while chasing runaway [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] slaves</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1933 Steinbeck published ''[[The Red Pony]]'', a 100-page, four-chapter story weaving in memories of Steinbeck's childhood</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bio&quot;/&gt; ''[[To a God Unknown]]'', named after a Vedic hymn,&lt;ref name=&quot;Benson&quot;/&gt; follows the life of a [[Homestead Act|homesteader]] and his family in California, depicting a character with a primal and pagan worship of the land he works</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he still had not achieved the status of a well-known writer, he never doubted that he would achieve greatness</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Benson&quot;/&gt;Steinbeck achieved his first critical success with ''[[Tortilla Flat]]'' (1935), a novel set in post-war Monterey, California, that won the California [[Commonwealth Club of California|Commonwealth Club]]'s Gold Medal</span>

				<span class='text'>In presenting the 1962 Nobel Prize to Steinbeck, the Swedish Academy cited &quot;spicy and comic tales about a gang of ''paisanos'', asocial individuals who, in their wild revels, are almost caricatures of [[Round Table|King Arthur's Knights of the Round Table]]</span>

				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=July 2013}}Steinbeck began to write a series of &quot;California novels&quot; and [[Dust Bowl]] fiction, set among common people during the [[Great Depression]]</span>
				<span class='text'>These included ''[[In Dubious Battle]]'', ''[[Of Mice and Men]]'' and ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>He also wrote an article series called ''[[The Harvest Gypsies]]'' for the ''San Francisco News'' about the plight of the migrant worker,''Of Mice and Men'' was a [[drama]] about the dreams of a pair of migrant agricultural laborers in California</span>
				<span class='text'>It was critically acclaimed&lt;ref name=&quot;Bio&quot;/&gt; and Steinbeck's 1962 Nobel Prize citation called it a &quot;little masterpiece&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=nobel/&gt;Its stage production was a hit, starring [[Wallace Ford]] as  George and starring [[Broderick Crawford]] as George's companion - the mentally childlike but physically powerful itinerant farmhand Lennie</span>

				<span class='text'>Kaufman]] that the play as it existed in his own mind was &quot;perfect&quot; and that anything presented on stage would only be a disappointment</span>
				<span class='text'>Steinbeck would write two more stage plays (''[[The Moon Is Down]]'' and ''[[Burning Bright]]'')</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=bruce/&gt;===1940s–1960s work===Steinbeck's novel ''[[The Moon Is Down]]'' (1942), about the [[Socrates]]-inspired spirit of resistance in an occupied village in [[Northern Europe]], was made into a film almost immediately</span>
				<span class='text'>It was presumed that the unnamed country of the novel was Norway and [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|the occupiers]] the Nazis, and in 1945 Steinbeck received the [[Haakon VII Cross of freedom]] for his literary contributions to the [[Norwegian resistance movement]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1943, Steinbeck served as a World War II [[war correspondent]] for the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' and worked with the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (predecessor of the CIA)</span>

				<span class='text'>Coers&lt;/ref&gt; It was at that time he became friends with [[Will Lang, Jr</span>
				<span class='text'>] of ''Time''/''Life'' magazine</span>
				<span class='text'>During the war, Steinbeck accompanied the commando raids of [[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr</span>
				<span class='text'>]'s [[Beach Jumpers]] program, which launched small-unit diversion operations against German-held islands in the [[Mediterranean]]</span>
				<span class='text'>At one point, he accompanied Fairbanks on an invasion of an island off the coast of Italy and helped capture Italian and German prisoners, using a Tommy Gun</span>
				<span class='text'>Some of his writings from this period were incorporated in the documentary ''[[Once There Was a War]]'' (1958)</span>
				<span class='text'>teinbeck returned from the war with a number of wounds from [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] and some psychological trauma</span>
				<span class='text'>He treated himself, as ever, by writing</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Lifeboat (film)|Lifeboat]]'' (1944), and the film ''[[A Medal for Benny]]'' (1945) with screenwriter [[Jack Wagner (screenwriter)|Jack Wagner]] about [[Compadre|paisanos]] from ''[[Tortilla Flat]]'' going to war</span>
				<span class='text'>He later requested that his name be removed from the credits of ''Lifeboat'' because he believed the final version of the film had racist undertones</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1944, suffering from homesickness for his Pacific Grove/Monterey life of the 1930s, he wrote ''[[Cannery Row]]'' (1945) which became so famous that Ocean View Avenue in [[Monterey]], the location of the book, was eventually renamed Cannery Row in 1958</span>
				<span class='text'>fter the end of the war, he wrote ''[[The Pearl (novel)|The Pearl]]'' (1947), already knowing it would be filmed</span>
				<span class='text'>The story first appeared in the December 1945 issue of [[Woman's Home Companion]] magazine as &quot;The Pearl of the World</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; It was illustrated by [[John Alan Maxwell]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The novel is an imaginative telling of a story which Steinbeck had heard in La Paz in 1940, as related in ''The Log From the Sea of Cortez'', which he described in Chapter 11 as being &quot;so much like a parable that it almost can't be&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;!--the citation is The Log From the Sea of Cortez, see chapter 11--&gt; Steinbeck traveled to Mexico for the filming with Wagner who helped with the script; on this trip he would be inspired by the story of [[Emiliano Zapata]], and subsequently wrote a film script (''[[Viva Zapata!]]'') directed by [[Elia Kazan]] and starring [[Marlon Brando]] and [[Anthony Quinn]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1947, Steinbeck made the first of many trips to the [[Soviet Union]], this one with photographer [[Robert Capa]]</span>
				<span class='text'>They visited [[Moscow]], [[Kiev]], [[Tbilisi]], [[Batumi]] and [[Stalingrad]], some of the first Americans to visit many parts of the USSR since the [[communist revolution]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Steinbeck's 1948 book about their experiences, ''[[A Russian Journal]]'', was illustrated with Capa's photos</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1948, the year the book was published, Steinbeck was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1952 Steinbeck's longest novel, ''[[East of Eden (novel)|East of Eden]]'', was published</span>
				<span class='text'> According to his third wife, Elaine, he considered it his ''magnum opus'', his greatest novel</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1952, John Steinbeck appeared as the on-screen narrator of [[20th Century Fox]]'s film, ''[[O</span>
				<span class='text'>Henry's Full House]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Steinbeck later admitted he was uncomfortable before the camera, he provided interesting introductions to several filmed adaptations of short stories by the legendary writer [[O</span>
				<span class='text'>Henry]]</span>
				<span class='text'>About the same time, Steinbeck recorded readings of several of his short stories for [[Columbia Records]]; despite some stiffness, the recordings provide a record of Steinbeck's deep, resonant voice</span>
				<span class='text'>ollowing the success of ''Viva Zapata!'', Steinbeck collaborated with Kazan on ''[[East of Eden (film)|East of Eden]]'', [[James Dean]]'s film debut</span>

				<span class='text'>This first novel tells the story of a fruit pickers' strike in California which is both aided and damaged by the help of &quot;the Party,&quot; generally taken to be the [[Communist Party]], although this is never spelled out in the book</span>
				<span class='text'>==''Of Mice and Men''==={{Main|Of Mice and Men}}''Of Mice and Men'' is a tragedy that was written in the form of a play in 1937</span>
				<span class='text'>The story is about two traveling ranch workers, George and Lennie, trying to work up enough money to buy their own farm/ranch</span>
				<span class='text'>As it is set in 1930s America, it provides an insight into The Great Depression, encompassing themes of racism, loneliness, prejudice against the mentally ill, and the struggle for personal independence</span>
				<span class='text'>Along with ''The Grapes of Wrath'', ''East of Eden'', and ''The Pearl'', ''Of Mice and Men'' is one of Steinbeck's best known works</span>
				<span class='text'>It was made into a movie three times, [[Of Mice and Men (1939 film)|in 1939]] starring [[Burgess Meredith]], [[Lon Chaney Jr</span>
				<span class='text'>], and [[Betty Field]], in 1982 starring [[Randy Quaid]], [[Robert Blake (actor)|Robert Blake]] and [[Ted Neeley]], and [[Of Mice and Men (1992 film)|in 1992]] starring [[Gary Sinise]] and [[John Malkovich]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Steinbeck nicknamed his truck ''[[Rocinante]]'' after [[Don Quixote]]'s &quot;noble steed&quot;</span>
