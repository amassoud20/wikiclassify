				<span class='text'>ng|250px|thumb|Poland (red) at the end of the reign of Casimir III (1370); [[Silesia]] (yellow) had been lost, but the Kingdom was expanding to the east]]When Casimir attained the throne in 1333, his position was in danger, as his neighbours did not recognise his title and instead called him &quot;king of [[Kraków]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The kingdom was depopulated and exhausted by war, and the [[economic system|economy]] was ruined</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1335, in the [[Treaty of Trentschin]], Casimir was forced to relinquish his claims to [[Silesia]] &quot;in perpetuity&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>asimir rebuilt and his kingdom became prosperous and wealthy, with great prospects for the future</span>
				<span class='text'>He waged many victorious wars and doubled the size of the kingdom, mostly through addition of lands in modern-day [[Ukraine]] (then called the Duchy of [[Halych]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Casimir built extensively during his reign, including [[Wawel Castle]] and [[Orle Gniazda]], and he reformed the Polish [[army]]At the [[Sejm]] in [[Wiślica]], on 11 March 1347, Casimir introduced reforms to the Polish judicial system and sanctioned [[Civil law (private law)|civil]] and [[criminal law|criminal]] codes for Great and Lesser Poland, earning the title &quot;the Polish Justinian&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He founded the [[University of Kraków]], the oldest Polish University, and he organized a [[Congress of Kraków|meeting of kings in Kraków]] in 1364 at which he exhibited the wealth of the Polish kingdom</span>

				<span class='text'>== Succession ===In 1355, in [[Buda]], Casimir designated his nephew [[Louis I of Hungary]] as his successor should he produce no male heir, as his father had with [[Charles I of Hungary]] to gain his help against Bohemia</span>
				<span class='text'>In exchange Casimir gained Hungarian favourable attitude, needed in disputes with the hostile Teutonic Order and Kingdom of Bohemia</span>
				<span class='text'>Casimir at the time was still in his early years and having a son did not seem to be a problem (he already had a few bastard children)</span>

				<span class='text'>ng|thumb|left|''[[The Second Taking of Ruthenia</span>

				<span class='text'>He tried to adopt his grandson, [[Casimir IV, Duke of Pomerania]], in his last will</span>
				<span class='text'>The child had been born to his second daughter, [[Elisabeth of Poland (1326–1361)|Elisabeth, Duchess of Pomerania]], in 1351</span>
				<span class='text'>This part of the testament was invalidated by Louis I of Hungary, however, who had traveled to [[Kraków]] quickly after Casimir died and bribed the nobles with future privileges</span>
				<span class='text'>Casimir III had a son-in-law, [[Louis VI the Roman|Louis VI]] of Bavaria, [[Margrave]] and [[Prince-elector]] of [[Brandenburg]], who was considered a possible successor, but he was deemed ineligible as his wife, Casimir's daughter Cunigunde, had died in 1357 without issue</span>
				<span class='text'> Thus King Louis I of Hungary became successor in Poland</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis was proclaimed king upon Casimir's death in 1370, though Casimir's sister Elisabeth (Louis's mother) held much of the real power until her death in 1380</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|''[[Veche#Poland|Wiec]]'' in reign of Casimir the Great]]Casimir was facetiously named &quot;the Peasants' King&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He introduced the codes of law of Greater and Lesser Poland as an attempt to end the overwhelming superiority of the nobility</span>
				<span class='text'>During his reign all three major classes — the nobility, priesthood, and bourgeoisie — were more or less counterbalanced, allowing Casimir to strengthen his monarchic position</span>
				<span class='text'>He was known for siding with the weak when the law did not protect them from nobles and clergymen</span>
				<span class='text'>He reportedly even supported a peasant whose house had been demolished by his own mistress, after she had ordered it to be pulled down because it disturbed her enjoyment of the beautiful landscape</span>

				<span class='text'>Casimir first married Anna, or [[Aldona of Lithuania|Aldona Ona]], the daughter of Grand Duke [[Gediminas]] of [[Lithuania]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The marriage produced two daughters, Cunigunde (d</span>

				<span class='text'>Following the death of her first husband she had entered the court of [[Bohemia]] in [[Prague]] as a [[lady-in-waiting]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Casimir brought her with him from Prague and convinced the abbot of the [[Benedictine]] [[abbey]] of [[Tyniec]] to marry them</span>
