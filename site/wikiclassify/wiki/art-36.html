				<span class='text'>iographyAntoine Laurent Lavoisier was born to a wealthy family in Paris on 26 August 1743</span>
				<span class='text'>The son of an attorney at the Parliament of Paris he inherited a large fortune at the age of five with the passing of his mother</span>
				<span class='text'> Lavoisier began his schooling at the   known as the Collège Mazarin in Paris in 1754 at the age of 11</span>
				<span class='text'>In his last two years 1760–1761 at the school his scientific interests were aroused and he studied    and mathematics</span>
				<span class='text'>In the philosophy class he came under the tutelage of  a distinguished mathematician and observational astronomer who imbued the young Lavoisier with an interest in meteorological observation an enthusiasm which never left him</span>
				<span class='text'>Lavoisier entered the school of law where he received a bachelors degree in 1763 and a licentiate in 1764</span>
				<span class='text'>Lavoisier received a  and was admitted to the  but never practiced as a lawyer</span>
				<span class='text'>However he continued his scientific education in his spare time</span>
				<span class='text'>avoisiers education was filled with the ideals of the French  of the time and he was fascinated by s dictionary of chemistry</span>
				<span class='text'>He attended lectures in the natural sciences</span>
				<span class='text'>Lavoisiers devotion and passion for chemistry were largely influenced by  a prominent French scholar of the 18th century</span>
				<span class='text'>His first chemical publication appeared in 1764</span>
				<span class='text'>From 1763 to 1767 he studied geology under </span>
				<span class='text'>In collaboration with Guettard Lavoisier worked on a geological survey of  in June 1767</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1764 he read his first paper to the  Frances most elite scientific society on the chemical and physical properties of  hydrated  and in 1766 he was awarded a gold medal by the King for an essay on the problems of urban </span>
				<span class='text'>In 1768 Lavoisier received a provisional appointment to the Academy of Sciences</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1769 he worked on the first geological map of France</span>
				<span class='text'>t the age of 26 around the time he was elected to the Academy of Sciences Lavoisier bought a share in the  a  financial company which advanced the estimated tax revenue to the royal government in return for the right to collect the taxes</span>
				<span class='text'>His participation in the French Government and the collection of its taxes did not help his reputation when the  began in France as taxes and poor government orm were the primary motivators during the French Revolution</span>
				<span class='text'>Lavoisier attempted to introduce orms in the French  and taxation system to help the peasants</span>
				<span class='text'>While in government work he helped develop the  to secure uniformity of  throughout France</span>
				<span class='text'>Lavoisier consolidated his social and economic position when in 1771 at age 28 he married  the 13 year old daughter of a senior member of the Ferme générale</span>

				<span class='text'>tml Lavoisier le parcours dun scientifique révolutionnaire  She was to play an important part in Lavoisiers scientific career—notably she translated English documents for him including s Essay on Phlogiston and s research</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition she assisted him in the laboratory and created many  and carved engravings of the laboratory instruments used by Lavoisier and his colleagues for their scientific works</span>
				<span class='text'>adame Lavoisier edited and published Antoines memoirs whether any English translations of those memoirs have survived is unknown as of today and hosted parties at which eminent scientists discussed ideas and problems related to chemistry</span>
				<span class='text'> For 3 years following his entry into the Ferme générale Lavoisiers scientific activity diminished somewhat for much of his time was taken up with official Ferme générale business</span>
				<span class='text'>He did however present one important memoir to the Academy of Sciences during this period on the supposed conversion of water into earth by evaporation</span>
				<span class='text'>By a very precise quantitative experiment Lavoisier showed that the earthy sediment produced after long continued lux heating of water in a glass vessel was not due to a conversion of the water into earth but rather to the gradual disintegration of the inside of the glass vessel produced by the boiling water</span>
				<span class='text'>uring late 1772 Lavoisier turned his attention to the phenomenon of  the topic on which he was to make his most significant contribution to science</span>
				<span class='text'>He reported the results of his first experiments on combustion in a note to the Academy on 20 October in which he reported that when  burned it combined with a large quantity of air to produce  and that the phosphorus increased in weight on burning</span>
				<span class='text'>In a second sealed note deposited with the Academy a few weeks later 1 November Lavoisier extended his observations and conclusions to the burning of  and went on to add that what is observed in the combustion of sulfur and phosphorus may well take place in the case of all substances that gain in weight by combustion and calcination and I am persuaded that the increase in weight of metallic calces is due to the same cause</span>
				<span class='text'>During 1773 Lavoisier determined to review thoroughly the literature on air particularly fixed air and to repeat many of the experiments of other workers in the field</span>
				<span class='text'>He published an account of this review in 1774 in a book entitled Opuscules physiques et chimiques Physical and Chemical Essays</span>
				<span class='text'>In the course of this review he made his first full study of the work of  the Scottish chemist who had carried out a series of classic quantitative experiments on the mild and caustic alkalies</span>
				<span class='text'>Black had shown that the difference between a mild alkali for example   and the caustic form for example   lay in the fact that the former contained fixed air not common air fixed in the chalk but a distinct chemical species now understood to be  COsub2 sub which was a constituent of the atmosphere</span>
				<span class='text'>Lavoisier recognized that Blacks fixed air was identical with the air evolved when metal calces were reduced with the charcoal and even suggested that the air which combined with metals on calcination and increased the weight might be Blacks fixed air that is COsub2 sub</span>
				<span class='text'>In the spring of 1774 Lavoisier carried out experiments on the calcination of tin and lead in sealed vessels which conclusively confirmed that the increase in weight of metals in combustion was due to combination with air</span>
				<span class='text'>But the question remained about whether it was combination with common atmospheric air or with only a part of atmospheric air</span>
				<span class='text'>In October the English chemist  visited Paris where he met Lavoisier and told him of the air which he had produced by heating the  of mercury with a burning glass and which had supported combustion with extreme vigor</span>
				<span class='text'>Priestley at this time was unsure of the nature of this gas but he felt that it was an especially pure form of common air</span>
				<span class='text'>Lavoisier carried out his own researches on this peculiar substance</span>
				<span class='text'>The result was his famous memoir On the Nature of the Principle Which Combines with Metals during Their Calcination and Increases Their Weight read to the Academy on 26 April 1775 commonly erred to as the Easter Memoir</span>
				<span class='text'>In the original memoir Lavoisier showed that the mercury calx was a true metallic calx in that it could be reduced with  giving off Blacks fixed air in the process</span>

				<span class='text'>tml Memoir on Combustion in General English translation  When reduced without charcoal it gave off an air which supported respiration and combustion in an enhanced way</span>
				<span class='text'>He concluded that this was just a pure form of common air and that it was the air itself undivided without alteration without decomposition which combined with metals on calcination</span>
				<span class='text'>fter returning from Paris Priestley took up once again his investigation of the air from mercury calx</span>
				<span class='text'>His results now showed that this air was not just an especially pure form of common air but was five or six times better than common air for the purpose of respiration inflammation and </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>every other use of common air</span>
				<span class='text'>He called the air dephlogisticated air as he thought it was common air deprived of its phlogiston</span>
				<span class='text'>Since it was theore in a state to absorb a much greater quantity of phlogiston given off by burning bodies and respiring animals the greatly enhanced combustion of substances and the greater ease of breathing in this air were explained</span>
				<span class='text'>The official version of Lavoisiers Easter Memoir appeared in 1778</span>
				<span class='text'>In the intervening period Lavoisier had ample time to repeat some of Priestleys latest experiments and perform some new ones of his own</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition to studying Priestleys dephlogisticated air he studied more thoroughly the residual air after metals had been calcined</span>
				<span class='text'>He showed that this residual air supported neither combustion nor respiration and that approximately five volumes of this air added to one volume of the dephlogisticated air gave common atmospheric air</span>
				<span class='text'>Common air was then a mixture of two distinct chemical species with quite different properties</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus when the revised version of the Easter Memoir was published in 1778 Lavoisier no longer stated that the principle which combined with metals on calcination was just common air but nothing else than the healthiest and purest part of the air or the eminently respirable part of the air</span>
				<span class='text'>In the following year Lavoisier coined the name oxygen for this constituent of the air from the Greek words meaning acid former</span>

				<span class='text'>He held that all acids contained oxygen and that oxygen was theore the acidifying principle</span>
				<span class='text'>Lavoisiers chemical research between 1772 and 1778 was largely concerned with developing his own new theory of combustion</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1783 he read to the academy his famous paper entitled Réflexions sur le phlogistique Reflections on Phlogiston a full scale attack on the current  of combustion</span>
				<span class='text'>That year Lavoisier also began a series of experiments on the composition of water which were to prove an important capstone to his combustion theory and win many converts to it</span>
				<span class='text'>Many investigators had been experimenting with the combination of s inflammable air which Lavoisier termed   for water former with dephlogisticated air oxygen by electrically sparking mixtures of the gases</span>
				<span class='text'>All of the researchers noted the production of water but all interpreted the reaction in varying ways within the framework of the phlogiston theory</span>
				<span class='text'>In cooperation with mathematician  Lavoisier synthesized water by burning jets of hydrogen and oxygen in a bell jar over mercury</span>
				<span class='text'>The quantitative results were good enough to support the contention that water was not an element as had been thought for over 2000 years but a compound of two gases hydrogen and oxygen</span>
				<span class='text'>avoisiers researches on combustion were carried out in the midst of a very busy schedule of public and private duties especially in connection with the Ferme générale</span>
				<span class='text'>There were also innumerable reports for and committees of the Academy of Sciences to investigate specific problems on order of the royal government</span>
				<span class='text'>Lavoisier whose organizing skills were outstanding frequently landed the task of writing up such official reports</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1775 he was made one of four commissioners of gunpowder appointed to replace a private company similar to the Ferme générale which had proved unsatisfactory in supplying France with its munitions requirements</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result of his efforts both the quantity and quality of French  greatly improved and it became a source of revenue for the government</span>
				<span class='text'>His appointment to the Gunpowder Commission brought one great benefit to Lavoisiers scientific career as well</span>
				<span class='text'>As a commissioner he enjoyed both a house and a laboratory in the Royal Arsenal</span>
				<span class='text'>Here he lived and worked between 1775 and 1792</span>
				<span class='text'>avoisiers researches included some of the first truly </span>

				<span class='text'>Thus for instance if a piece of wood is burned to ashes the total mass remains unchanged if gaseous reactants and products are included</span>

				<span class='text'>The new system was tied inextricably to Lavoisiers new oxygen theory of chemistry</span>
				<span class='text'>The  of earth air fire and water were discarded and instead some 55 substances which could not be decomposed into simpler substances by any known chemical means were provisionally listed as elements</span>
				<span class='text'>The elements included light  matter of heat the principles of oxygen hydrogen and azote  carbon sulfur phosphorus the yet unknown radicals of muriatic acid   and fluoric acid 17 metals 5 earths mainly oxides of yet unknown metals such as   and  three alkalies   and  and the radicals of 19 organic acids</span>
				<span class='text'>The acids regarded in the new system as compounds of various elements with oxygen were given names which indicated the element involved together with the degree of oxygenation of that element for example sulfuric and sulfurous acids phosphoric and phosphorus acids nitric and nitrous acids the ic termination indicating acids with a higher proportion of oxygen than those with the ous ending</span>
				<span class='text'>Similarly salts of the ic acids were given the terminal letters ate as in copper sulfate whereas the salts of the ous acids terminated with the suffix ite as in copper sulfite</span>
				<span class='text'>The total effect of the new nomenclature can be gauged by comparing the new name  with the old term vitriol of Venus</span>
				<span class='text'>Lavoisier described this system of nomenclature in Méthode de nomenclature chimique Method of Chemical Nomenclature 1787</span>
				<span class='text'>avoisier employed the new nomenclature in his  Elementary Treatise on Chemistry published in 1789</span>
				<span class='text'>This work represents the synthesis of Lavoisiers contribution to chemistry and can be considered the first modern  on the subject</span>
				<span class='text'>The core of the work was the oxygen theory and the work became a most effective vehicle for the transmission of the new doctrines</span>
				<span class='text'>It presented a unified view of new theories of chemistry contained a clear statement of the law of  and denied the existence of phlogiston</span>
				<span class='text'>This text clarified the concept of an element as a substance that could not be broken down by any known method of chemical analysis and presented Lavoisiers theory of the formation of chemical compounds from elements</span>
				<span class='text'>It remains a classic in the history of science</span>
				<span class='text'>While many leading chemists of the time used to accept Lavoisiers new ideas demand for Traité élémentaire as a textbook in Edinburgh was sufficient to merit translation into English within about a year of its French publication</span>

				<span class='text'> In any event the Traité élémentaire was sufficiently sound to convince the next generation</span>
				<span class='text'>he relationship between combustion and respiration had long been recognized from the essential role which air played in both processes</span>
				<span class='text'>Lavoisier was almost obliged theore to extend his new theory of combustion to include the area of </span>
				<span class='text'>His first memoirs on this topic were read to the Academy of Sciences in 1777 but his most significant contribution to this field was made in the winter of 1782 1783 in association with </span>
				<span class='text'>The result of this work was published in a famous memoir On Heat</span>
				<span class='text'>Lavoisier and Laplace designed an ice  apparatus for measuring the amount of heat given off during combustion or respiration</span>
				<span class='text'>The outer shell of the calorimeter was packed with snow which melted to maintain a constant temperature of  around an inner shell filled with ice</span>
				<span class='text'>By measuring the quantity of  and heat produced by confining a live guinea pig in this apparatus and by comparing the amount of heat produced when sufficient carbon was burned in the ice calorimeter to produce the same amount of carbon dioxide as that which the guinea pig exhaled they concluded that respiration was in fact a slow combustion process</span>
				<span class='text'>Lavoisier stated la respiration est donc une combustion that is respiratory gas exchange is a combustion like that of a candle burning</span>

				<span class='text'>They designed an ambitious set of experiments to study the whole process of body  and respiration using Seguin as a human guinea pig in the experiments</span>
				<span class='text'>Their work was only partially completed and published because of the disruption of the Revolution but Lavoisiers pioneering work in this field served to inspire similar research on physiological processes for generations to come</span>
				<span class='text'>s the  gained momentum from 1789 on Lavoisiers world inexorably collapsed around him</span>
				<span class='text'>Attacks mounted on the deeply unpopular Ferme Générale and it was eventually suppressed in 1791</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1792 Lavoisier was forced to resign from his post on the Gunpowder Commission and to move from his house and laboratory at the Royal Arsenal</span>
				<span class='text'>On 8 August 1793 all the learned societies including the Academy of Sciences were suppressed</span>
				<span class='text'>t is difficult to assess Lavoisiers own attitude to the political turmoil</span>
				<span class='text'>Like so many intellectual liberals he felt that the  could be ormed from the inside if only reason and moderation prevailed</span>
				<span class='text'>Characteristically one of his last major works was a proposal to the  for the orm of French education</span>
				<span class='text'>He tried to remain aloof from the political cockpit no doubt fearful and uncomprehending of the violence he saw therein</span>
				<span class='text'>However on 24 November 1793 the arrest of all the former tax gatherers was ordered</span>
				<span class='text'>He was branded a traitor by the Convention under  during the  in 1794</span>
				<span class='text'>Actions such as attacking distinguished academics such as Antoine Lavoisier helped to establish Robespierre as a tyrant and intolerant of progress eventually this would be one of the keys to his downfall</span>
				<span class='text'>Lavoisier had also intervened on behalf of a number of foreign born scientists including mathematician  which helped to exempt them from a mandate stripping all foreigners of possessions and freedom</span>
