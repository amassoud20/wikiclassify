				<span class='text'>Co-edited_with_Seymour_Mauskopf_and_William_Newman}}&lt;/ref&gt;It is generally accepted that Lavoisier's great accomplishments in chemistry largely stem from his changing the science from a qualitative to a quantitative one</span>
				<span class='text'>Lavoisier is most noted for his discovery of the role [[oxygen]] plays in [[combustion]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He recognized and named [[oxygen]] (1778) and [[hydrogen]] (1783) and opposed the [[phlogiston theory]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Lavoisier helped construct the [[metric system]], wrote the first extensive [[history of the periodic table#Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier|list of elements]], and helped to reform [[chemical nomenclature]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He predicted the existence of [[silicon]] (1787)&lt;ref&gt;In his table of the elements, Lavoisier listed five &quot;salifiable earths&quot; (i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> ores that could be made to react with acids to produce salts (''salis'' = salt, in Latin)):  ''chaux'' (calcium oxide), ''magnésie'' (magnesia, magnesium oxide), ''baryte'' (barium sulfate), ''alumine'' (alumina, aluminum oxide), and ''silice'' (silica, silicon dioxide)</span>
				<span class='text'>About these &quot;elements&quot;, Lavoisier speculates:  &quot;We are probably only acquainted as yet with a part of the metallic substances existing in nature, as all those which have a stronger affinity to oxygen than carbon possesses, are incapable, hitherto, of being reduced to a metallic state, and consequently, being only presented to our observation under the form of oxyds, are confounded with earths</span>
				<span class='text'>It is extremely probable that barytes, which we have just now arranged with earths, is in this situation; for in many experiments it exhibits properties nearly approaching to those of metallic bodies</span>
				<span class='text'>It is even possible that all the substances we call earths may be only metallic oxyds, irreducible by any hitherto known process</span>

				<span class='text'>=Biography=====Early life and education===Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier was born to a wealthy family in Paris on 26 August 1743</span>
				<span class='text'>The son of an attorney at the Parliament of Paris, he inherited a large fortune at the age of five with the passing of his mother</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Cite CE1913|wstitle=Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lavoisier began his schooling at the [[Collège des Quatre-Nations]], [[University of Paris]], (known as the Collège Mazarin) in Paris in 1754 at the age of 11</span>
				<span class='text'>In his last two years (1760–1761) at the school, his scientific interests were aroused, and he studied [[chemistry]], [[botany]], [[astronomy]], and mathematics</span>
				<span class='text'>In the philosophy class he came under the tutelage of [[Abbé Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]], a distinguished mathematician and observational astronomer who imbued the young Lavoisier with an interest in meteorological observation, an enthusiasm which never left him</span>
				<span class='text'>Lavoisier entered the school of law, where he received a bachelor's degree in 1763 and a licentiate in 1764</span>
				<span class='text'>Lavoisier received a [[law degree]] and was admitted to the [[bar association|bar]], but never practiced as a lawyer</span>
				<span class='text'>However, he continued his scientific education in his spare time</span>
				<span class='text'>==Early scientific work===Lavoisier's education was filled with the ideals of the French [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] of the time, and he was fascinated by [[Pierre Macquer]]'s dictionary of chemistry</span>
				<span class='text'>He attended lectures in the natural sciences</span>
				<span class='text'>Lavoisier's devotion and passion for chemistry were largely influenced by [[Étienne Condillac]], a prominent French scholar of the 18th century</span>
				<span class='text'>His first chemical publication appeared in 1764</span>
				<span class='text'>From 1763 to 1767, he studied geology under [[Jean-Étienne Guettard]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In collaboration with Guettard, Lavoisier worked on a geological survey of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] in June 1767</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1764 he read his first paper to the [[French Academy of Sciences]], France's most elite scientific society, on the chemical and physical properties of [[gypsum]] (hydrated [[calcium sulfate]]), and in 1766 he was awarded a gold medal by the King for an essay on the problems of urban [[street lighting]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1768 Lavoisier received a provisional appointment to the Academy of Sciences</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1769, he worked on the first geological map of France</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|''[[Portrait of Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier and his wife]]'' by [[Jacques-Louis David]], ca</span>
				<span class='text'>1788]]At the age of 26, around the time he was elected to the Academy of Sciences, Lavoisier bought a share in the ''[[Ferme générale]]'', a [[tax farming (France)|tax farming]] financial company which advanced the estimated tax revenue to the royal government in return for the right to collect the taxes</span>
				<span class='text'>His participation in the French Government and the collection of its taxes did not help his reputation when the [[Reign of Terror]] began in France, as taxes and poor government reform were the primary motivators during the French Revolution</span>
				<span class='text'>Lavoisier attempted to introduce reforms in the French [[monetary system|monetary]] and taxation system to help the peasants</span>
				<span class='text'>While in government work, he helped develop the [[International System of Units|metric system]] to secure uniformity of [[weights and measures]] throughout France</span>
				<span class='text'>Lavoisier consolidated his social and economic position when, in 1771 at age 28, he married [[Marie-Anne Pierrette Paulze]], the 13-year-old daughter of a senior member of the ''Ferme générale''</span>

				<span class='text'>007/s00897980249a}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 3 years following his entry into the ''Ferme générale'', Lavoisier's scientific activity diminished somewhat, for much of his time was taken up with official ''Ferme générale'' business</span>
				<span class='text'>He did, however, present one important memoir to the Academy of Sciences during this period, on the supposed conversion of water into earth by evaporation</span>
				<span class='text'>By a very precise quantitative experiment Lavoisier showed that the &quot;earthy&quot; sediment produced after long-continued reflux heating of water in a glass vessel was not due to a conversion of the water into earth but rather to the gradual disintegration of the inside of the glass vessel produced by the boiling water</span>
				<span class='text'>==Oxygen theory of combustion===[[File:Lavoisier decomposition air</span>
				<span class='text'>ng|thumb|Antoine Lavoisier's famous phlogiston experiment</span>
				<span class='text'>Engraving by [[Marie-Anne Pierrette Paulze|Mme Lavoisier]] in the 1780s taken from ''Traité élémentaire de chimie'' (Elementary treatise on chemistry)]]During late 1772 Lavoisier turned his attention to the phenomenon of [[combustion]], the topic on which he was to make his most significant contribution to science</span>
				<span class='text'>He reported the results of his first experiments on combustion in a note to the Academy on 20 October, in which he reported that when [[phosphorus]] burned, it combined with a large quantity of air to produce [[phosphoric acid|acid spirit of phosphorus]], and that the phosphorus increased in weight on burning</span>
				<span class='text'>In a second sealed note deposited with the Academy a few weeks later (1 November) Lavoisier extended his observations and conclusions to the burning of [[sulfur]] and went on to add that &quot;what is observed in the combustion of sulfur and phosphorus may well take place in the case of all substances that gain in weight by combustion and calcination: and I am persuaded that the increase in weight of metallic calces is due to the same cause</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;====Joseph Black's &quot;fixed air&quot;====During 1773 Lavoisier determined to review thoroughly the literature on air, particularly &quot;fixed air,&quot; and to repeat many of the experiments of other workers in the field</span>
				<span class='text'>He published an account of this review in 1774 in a book entitled ''Opuscules physiques et chimiques'' (Physical and Chemical Essays)</span>
				<span class='text'>In the course of this review he made his first full study of the work of [[Joseph Black]], the Scottish chemist who had carried out a series of classic quantitative experiments on the mild and caustic alkalies</span>
				<span class='text'>Black had shown that the difference between a mild alkali, for example, [[chalk]] ([[calcium carbonate|CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]), and the caustic form, for example, [[quicklime]] ([[calcium oxide|CaO]]), lay in the fact that the former contained &quot;fixed air,&quot; not common air fixed in the chalk, but a distinct chemical species, now understood to be [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which was a constituent of the atmosphere</span>
				<span class='text'>Lavoisier recognized that Black's fixed air was identical with the air evolved when metal calces were reduced with the charcoal and even suggested that the air which combined with metals on calcination and increased the weight might be Black's fixed air, that is, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'>===Joseph Priestley====[[File:Priestley</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|[[Joseph Priestley]], an English chemist known for isolating [[oxygen]], which he termed &quot;dephlogisticated air</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;]]In the spring of 1774 Lavoisier carried out experiments on the calcination of tin and lead in sealed vessels which conclusively confirmed that the increase in weight of metals in combustion was due to combination with air</span>
				<span class='text'>But the question remained about whether it was combination with common atmospheric air or with only a part of atmospheric air</span>
				<span class='text'>In October the English chemist [[Joseph Priestley]] visited Paris, where he met Lavoisier and told him of the air which he had produced by heating the [[red calx]] of mercury with a burning glass and which had supported combustion with extreme vigor</span>
				<span class='text'>Priestley at this time was unsure of the nature of this gas, but he felt that it was an especially pure form of common air</span>
				<span class='text'>Lavoisier carried out his own researches on this peculiar substance</span>
				<span class='text'>The result was his famous memoir ''On the Nature of the Principle Which Combines with Metals during Their Calcination and Increases Their Weight'', read to the Academy on 26 April 1775 (commonly referred to as the Easter Memoir)</span>
				<span class='text'>In the original memoir Lavoisier showed that the mercury calx was a true metallic calx in that it could be reduced with [[charcoal]], giving off Black's fixed air in the process</span>

				<span class='text'>du/~giunta/lavoisier1</span>
				<span class='text'>tml Memoir on Combustion in General] (English translation)&lt;/ref&gt; When reduced without charcoal, it gave off an air which supported respiration and combustion in an enhanced way</span>
				<span class='text'>He concluded that this was just a pure form of common air, and that it was the air itself &quot;undivided, without alteration, without decomposition&quot; which combined with metals on calcination</span>
				<span class='text'>fter returning from Paris, Priestley took up once again his investigation of the air from mercury calx</span>
				<span class='text'>His results now showed that this air was not just an especially pure form of common air but was &quot;five or six times better than common air, for the purpose of respiration, inflammation, and </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>every other use of common air</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He called the air dephlogisticated air, as he thought it was common air deprived of its phlogiston</span>
				<span class='text'>Since it was therefore in a state to absorb a much greater quantity of phlogiston given off by burning bodies and respiring animals, the greatly enhanced combustion of substances and the greater ease of breathing in this air were explained</span>
				<span class='text'>===Easter memoir====The &quot;official&quot; version of Lavoisier's Easter Memoir appeared in 1778</span>
				<span class='text'>In the intervening period Lavoisier had ample time to repeat some of Priestley's latest experiments and perform some new ones of his own</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition to studying Priestley's dephlogisticated air, he studied more thoroughly the residual air after metals had been calcined</span>
				<span class='text'>He showed that this residual air supported neither combustion nor respiration and that approximately five volumes of this air added to one volume of the dephlogisticated air gave common atmospheric air</span>
				<span class='text'>Common air was then a mixture of two distinct chemical species with quite different properties</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus when the revised version of the Easter Memoir was published in 1778, Lavoisier no longer stated that the principle which combined with metals on calcination was just common air but &quot;nothing else than the healthiest and purest part of the air&quot; or the &quot;eminently respirable part of the air</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; In the following year Lavoisier coined the name oxygen for this constituent of the air, from the Greek words meaning &quot;acid former</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;in French&quot;/&gt; and ''&quot;Considérations générales sur la nature des acides&quot;'' (&quot;General Considerations on the Nature of Acids,&quot; 1778),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>He held that all acids contained oxygen and that oxygen was therefore the acidifying principle</span>
				<span class='text'>===Dismantling phlogiston theory====Lavoisier's chemical research between 1772 and 1778 was largely concerned with developing his own new theory of combustion</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1783 he read to the academy his famous paper entitled ''Réflexions sur le phlogistique'' (Reflections on Phlogiston), a full-scale attack on the current [[phlogiston theory]] of combustion</span>
				<span class='text'>That year Lavoisier also began a series of experiments on the composition of water which were to prove an important capstone to his combustion theory and win many converts to it</span>
				<span class='text'>Many investigators had been experimenting with the combination of [[Henry Cavendish]]'s inflammable air, which Lavoisier termed [[hydrogen]] ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]] for &quot;water-former&quot;), with dephlogisticated air (oxygen) by electrically sparking mixtures of the gases</span>
				<span class='text'>All of the researchers noted the production of water, but all interpreted the reaction in varying ways within the framework of the phlogiston theory</span>
				<span class='text'>In cooperation with mathematician [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Pierre Simon de Laplace]], Lavoisier synthesized water by burning jets of hydrogen and oxygen in a bell jar over mercury</span>
				<span class='text'>The quantitative results were good enough to support the contention that water was not an element, as had been thought for over 2,000 years, but a compound of two gases, hydrogen and oxygen</span>
				<span class='text'>==Gunpowder Commission===Lavoisier's researches on combustion were carried out in the midst of a very busy schedule of public and private duties, especially in connection with the ''Ferme générale''</span>
				<span class='text'>There were also innumerable reports for and committees of the Academy of Sciences to investigate specific problems on order of the royal government</span>
				<span class='text'>Lavoisier, whose organizing skills were outstanding, frequently landed the task of writing up such official reports</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1775 he was made one of four commissioners of gunpowder appointed to replace a private company, similar to the Ferme générale, which had proved unsatisfactory in supplying France with its munitions requirements</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result of his efforts, both the quantity and quality of French [[gunpowder]] greatly improved, and it became a source of revenue for the government</span>
				<span class='text'>His appointment to the Gunpowder Commission brought one great benefit to Lavoisier's scientific career as well</span>
				<span class='text'>As a commissioner, he enjoyed both a house and a laboratory in the Royal Arsenal</span>
				<span class='text'>Here he lived and worked between 1775 and 1792</span>
				<span class='text'>==Pioneer of stoichiometry===Lavoisier's researches included some of the first truly [[stoichiometry|quantitative chemical experiments]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He carefully weighed the reactants and products of a chemical reaction in a sealed glass vessel so that no [[gas]]es could escape, which was a crucial step in the advancement of chemistry</span>

				<span class='text'>4&lt;/ref&gt; In 1774, he showed that, although matter can change its state in a chemical reaction, the total mass of matter is the same at the end as at the beginning of every chemical change</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, for instance, if a piece of wood is burned to ashes, the total mass remains unchanged if gaseous reactants and products are included</span>
				<span class='text'>Lavoisier's experiments supported the law of [[conservation of mass]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In France it is taught as Lavoisier's Law and is paraphrased from a statement in his &quot;[[Traité Élémentaire de Chimie]]&quot; to ''&quot;Rien ne se perd, rien ne se crée, tout se transforme</span>

				<span class='text'>if|thumb| right|250px| Lavoisier and Berthollet, Chimistes Celebres, [[Liebig's Extract of Meat Company]] Trading Card, 1929]]Lavoisier, together with [[Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau|L</span>
				<span class='text'>B</span>
				<span class='text'>Guyton de Morveau]], [[Claude-Louis Berthollet]], and [[Antoine François, comte de Fourcroy|Antoine François de Fourcroy]], submitted a new program for the reforms of [[chemical nomenclature]] to the Academy in 1787, for there was virtually no rational system of chemical nomenclature at this time</span>
				<span class='text'>The new system was tied inextricably to Lavoisier's new oxygen theory of chemistry</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Classical elements]] of earth, air, fire, and water were discarded, and instead some 55 substances which could not be decomposed into simpler substances by any known chemical means were provisionally listed as elements</span>
				<span class='text'>The elements included light; [[caloric theory|caloric]] (matter of heat); the principles of oxygen, hydrogen, and azote ([[nitrogen]]); carbon; sulfur; phosphorus; the yet unknown &quot;radicals&quot; of muriatic acid ([[hydrochloric acid]]), [[boric acid|boracic acid]], and &quot;fluoric&quot; acid; 17 metals; 5 earths (mainly oxides of yet unknown metals such as [[magnesium oxide|magnesia]], [[barite]], and [[strontia]]); three alkalies ([[potash]], [[Sodium oxide|soda]], and [[ammonia]]); and the &quot;radicals&quot; of 19 organic acids</span>
				<span class='text'>The acids, regarded in the new system as compounds of various elements with oxygen, were given names which indicated the element involved together with the degree of oxygenation of that element, for example sulfuric and sulfurous acids, phosphoric and phosphorus acids, nitric and nitrous acids, the &quot;ic&quot; termination indicating acids with a higher proportion of oxygen than those with the &quot;ous&quot; ending</span>
				<span class='text'>Similarly, salts of the &quot;ic&quot; acids were given the terminal letters &quot;ate,&quot; as in copper sulfate, whereas the salts of the &quot;ous&quot; acids terminated with the suffix &quot;ite,&quot; as in copper sulfite</span>
				<span class='text'>The total effect of the new nomenclature can be gauged by comparing the new name &quot;[[copper sulfate]]&quot; with the old term &quot;vitriol of Venus</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Lavoisier described this system of nomenclature in ''Méthode de nomenclature chimique'' (''Method of Chemical Nomenclature'', 1787)</span>
				<span class='text'>==Elementary Treatise of Chemistry===Lavoisier employed the new nomenclature in his ''[[Traité élémentaire de chimie]]'' (''Elementary Treatise on Chemistry''), published in 1789</span>
				<span class='text'>This work represents the synthesis of Lavoisier's contribution to chemistry and can be considered the first modern [[textbook]] on the subject</span>
				<span class='text'>The core of the work was the oxygen theory, and the work became a most effective vehicle for the transmission of the new doctrines</span>
				<span class='text'>It presented a unified view of new theories of chemistry, contained a clear statement of the law of [[conservation of mass]], and denied the existence of phlogiston</span>
				<span class='text'>This text clarified the concept of an element as a substance that could not be broken down by any known method of chemical analysis, and presented Lavoisier's theory of the formation of chemical compounds from elements</span>
				<span class='text'>It remains a classic in the history of science</span>
				<span class='text'>While many leading chemists of the time refused to accept Lavoisier's new ideas, demand for ''Traité élémentaire'' as a textbook in Edinburgh was sufficient to merit translation into English within about a year of its French publication</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See the &quot;Advertisement,&quot; p</span>
				<span class='text'>vi of Kerr's translation, and pp</span>
				<span class='text'>xxvi–xxvii, xxviii of Douglas McKie's introduction to the Dover edition</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In any event, the ''Traité élémentaire'' was sufficiently sound to convince the next generation</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|250px|Lavoisier conducting an experiment on respiration in the 1770s]]===Physiological work===[[File:Calorimeter</span>
				<span class='text'>if|left|thumb|184x184px|[[Constant-pressure calorimeter]], engraving made by madame Lavoisier for [[thermochemistry]] experiments]]The relationship between combustion and respiration had long been recognized from the essential role which air played in both processes</span>
				<span class='text'>Lavoisier was almost obliged, therefore, to extend his new theory of combustion to include the area of [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration physiology]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His first memoirs on this topic were read to the Academy of Sciences in 1777, but his most significant contribution to this field was made in the winter of 1782/1783 in association with [[Laplace]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The result of this work was published in a famous memoir, &quot;On Heat</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Lavoisier and Laplace designed an ice [[calorimeter]] apparatus for measuring the amount of heat given off during combustion or respiration</span>
				<span class='text'>The outer shell of the calorimeter was packed with snow, which melted to maintain a constant temperature of {{nowrap|0 °C}} around an inner shell filled with ice</span>
				<span class='text'>By measuring the quantity of [[carbon dioxide]] and heat produced by confining a live guinea pig in this apparatus, and by comparing the amount of heat produced when sufficient carbon was burned in the ice calorimeter to produce the same amount of carbon dioxide as that which the guinea pig exhaled, they concluded that respiration was in fact a slow combustion process</span>
				<span class='text'>Lavoisier stated, ''&quot;la respiration est donc une combustion,&quot;'' that is, respiratory gas exchange is a combustion, like that of a candle burning</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>79, No</span>
				<span class='text'>5, 899S–906S, May 2004&lt;/ref&gt;This continuous slow combustion, which they supposed took place in the lungs, enabled the living animal to maintain its body temperature above that of its surroundings, thus accounting for the puzzling phenomenon of animal heat</span>
				<span class='text'>Lavoisier continued these respiration experiments in 1789–1790 in cooperation with [[Armand Seguin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>They designed an ambitious set of experiments to study the whole process of body [[metabolism]] and respiration using Seguin as a human guinea pig in the experiments</span>
				<span class='text'>Their work was only partially completed and published because of the disruption of the Revolution; but Lavoisier's pioneering work in this field served to inspire similar research on physiological processes for generations to come</span>
				<span class='text'>==Final days and execution===As the [[French Revolution]] gained momentum from 1789 on, Lavoisier's world inexorably collapsed around him</span>
				<span class='text'>Attacks mounted on the deeply unpopular ''Ferme Générale'', and it was eventually suppressed in 1791</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1792 Lavoisier was forced to resign from his post on the Gunpowder Commission and to move from his house and laboratory at the Royal Arsenal</span>
				<span class='text'>On 8 August 1793, all the learned societies, including the Academy of Sciences, were suppressed</span>
				<span class='text'>t is difficult to assess Lavoisier's own attitude to the political turmoil</span>
				<span class='text'>Like so many intellectual liberals, he felt that the [[Ancien Régime]] could be reformed from the inside if only reason and moderation prevailed</span>
				<span class='text'>Characteristically, one of his last major works was a proposal to the [[National Convention]] for the reform of French education</span>
				<span class='text'>He tried to remain aloof from the political cockpit, no doubt fearful and uncomprehending of the violence he saw therein</span>
				<span class='text'>However, on 24 November 1793, the arrest of all the former tax gatherers was ordered</span>
				<span class='text'>He was branded a traitor by the Convention under [[Maximilien de Robespierre]] during the [[Reign of Terror]], in 1794</span>
				<span class='text'>Actions such as attacking distinguished academics such as Antoine Lavoisier helped to establish Robespierre as a tyrant and intolerant of progress, eventually this would be one of the keys to his downfall</span>
				<span class='text'>Lavoisier had also intervened on behalf of a number of foreign-born scientists including mathematician [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]], which helped to exempt them from a mandate stripping all foreigners of possessions and freedom</span>

				<span class='text'>Page from [[Udagawa Yōan]]'s 1840 ''Seimi Kaisō'']]Lavoisier's fundamental contributions to chemistry were a result of a conscious effort to fit all experiments into the framework of a single theory</span>
				<span class='text'>He established the consistent use of the [[chemical balance]], used oxygen to overthrow the phlogiston theory, and developed a new system of chemical nomenclature which held that oxygen was an essential constituent of all acids (which later turned out to be erroneous)</span>
				<span class='text'>Lavoisier also did early research in physical chemistry and thermodynamics in joint experiments with [[Laplace]]</span>
				<span class='text'>They used a calorimeter to estimate the heat evolved per unit of [[carbon dioxide]] produced, eventually finding the same ratio for a flame and animals, indicating that animals produced energy by a type of combustion reaction</span>
				<span class='text'>avoisier also contributed to early ideas on composition and chemical changes by stating the radical theory, believing that [[Radical (chemistry)|radicals]], which function as a single group in a chemical process, combine with oxygen in reactions</span>
				<span class='text'>He also introduced the possibility of [[allotropy|allotropy in chemical elements]] when he discovered that diamond is a [[allotropy|crystalline form of carbon]]</span>
				<span class='text'>e was essentially a theorist, and his great merit lay in his capacity to take over experimental work that others had carried out—without always adequately recognizing their claims—and by a rigorous logical procedure, reinforced his own quantitative experiments, expounding the true explanation of the results</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=May 2013}} He completed the work of Black, Priestley and Cavendish, and gave a correct explanation of their experiments</span>
