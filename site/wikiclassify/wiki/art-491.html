				<span class='text'>and Lillian Cray</span>
				<span class='text'>His father was a [[civil engineer]] who fostered Cray's interest in science and engineering</span>
				<span class='text'>As early as the age of ten he was able to build a device out of [[Erector Set]] components that converted punched [[paper tape]] into [[Morse code]] signals</span>
				<span class='text'>The basement of the family home was given over to the young Cray as a &quot;laboratory&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Murray (1997), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>46-47&lt;/ref&gt;Cray graduated from [[Chippewa Falls High School]] in 1943 before being [[conscription|drafted]] for [[World War II]] as a radio operator</span>
				<span class='text'>He saw action in [[European Theatre of World War II|Europe]], and then moved to the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific theatre]] where he worked on breaking [[Japanese naval codes]]</span>
				<span class='text'>On his return to the [[United States]] he received a [[Bachelor of Science|B</span>
				<span class='text'>c</span>
				<span class='text'>] in [[Electrical Engineering]] at the [[University of Minnesota]], graduating in 1949</span>
				<span class='text'>He also was awarded a [[Master of Science|M</span>
				<span class='text'>c</span>
				<span class='text'>] in [[applied mathematics]] in 1951</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Murray (1997), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>47-48&lt;/ref&gt;==Career=====Engineering Research Associates===In 1951, Cray joined [[Engineering Research Associates]] (ERA) in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;IEEECS&quot;/&gt; ERA had formed out of a former [[United States Navy]] laboratory that had built codebreaking machines, a tradition ERA carried on when such work was available</span>
				<span class='text'>ERA was introduced to computer technology during one such effort, but in other times had worked on a wide variety of basic engineering as well</span>
				<span class='text'>ray quickly came to be regarded as an expert on digital computer technology, especially following his design work on the [[ERA 1103]], the first commercially successful scientific computer</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;IEEECS&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>rg/portal/web/awards/seymourbio |title=Tribute to Seymour Cray |publisher=IEEE Computer Society |archiveurl=http://www</span>
				<span class='text'>ebcitation</span>
				<span class='text'>rg/5pOwR2VJX |archivedate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained at ERA when it was bought by [[Remington Rand]] and then [[Sperry Corporation]] in the early 1950s</span>
				<span class='text'>At the newly formed [[Sperry Corporation#Sperry Rand|Sperry-Rand]], ERA became the &quot;scientific computing&quot; arm of their [[UNIVAC]] division</span>
				<span class='text'>==Control Data Corporation===When the scientific computing division was phased out in 1957, a number of employees left to form [[Control Data Corporation]] (CDC)</span>
				<span class='text'>Cray wanted to follow immediately, but CDC's CEO, [[William Norris (CEO)|William Norris]], refused, as Cray was in the midst of completing a project for the Navy, with whom Norris was interested in maintaining a good relationship</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The project, the [[Naval Tactical Data System]], was completed early the next year, whereupon Cray left for CDC as well</span>
				<span class='text'>y 1960 he had completed the design of the [[CDC 1604]], an improved low-cost [[ERA 1103]] that had impressive performance for its price range</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Even as the [[CDC 1604]] was starting to ship to customers in 1960, Cray had already moved on to designing other computers</span>
				<span class='text'> He first worked on the design of an upgraded version (the [[CDC 3000]] series), but company management wanted these machines targeted toward 'business and commercial' data processing for average customers</span>
				<span class='text'> Cray did not enjoy working on such 'mundane' machines, constrained to design for low-cost construction, so CDC could sell lots of them</span>
				<span class='text'> His desire was to ''&quot;produce the largest [fastest] computer in the world&quot;''</span>
				<span class='text'> So after some basic design work on the CDC 3000 series, he turned that over to others and went on to work on the [[CDC 6600]]</span>
				<span class='text'> (But several unique features of the 6600 first start to appear in the 3000 series</span>
				<span class='text'>Although in terms of hardware the 6600 was not on the leading edge, Cray invested considerable effort into the design of the machine in an attempt to enable it to run as fast as possible</span>
				<span class='text'>Unlike most high-end projects, Cray realized that there was considerably more to performance than simple processor speed, that [[input/output|I/O]] bandwidth had to be maximized as well in order to avoid &quot;starving&quot; the processor of data to crunch</span>
				<span class='text'>As he later noted, ''Anyone can build a fast CPU</span>
				<span class='text'>The trick is to build a fast system</span>
				<span class='text'>'&lt;ref name=&quot;IEEECS&quot;/&gt;The 6600 was the first commercial supercomputer, outperforming everything then available by a wide margin</span>
				<span class='text'>While expensive, for those that needed the absolutely fastest computer available there was nothing else on the market that could compete</span>
				<span class='text'>When other companies (namely [[International Business Machines|IBM]]) attempted to create machines with similar performance, they stumbled ([[IBM Stretch|Stretch/IBM 7030]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Indeed, the 6600 solved a critical design problem —  &quot;imprecise interrupts&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Smotherman | first = Mark | author-link = | title = IBM Stretch (7030) — Aggressive Uniprocessor Parallelism | publisher = | date = | year = 2010 | url = http://people</span>
				<span class='text'>s</span>
				<span class='text'>lemson</span>
				<span class='text'>du/~mark/stretch</span>
				<span class='text'>tml | accessdate = 25 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; — that was largely responsible for IBM's failure</span>
				<span class='text'>He did this by replacing I/O interrupts with a polled request issued by one of 10 so-called peripheral processors, which were built-in mini-computers that did all transfers in and out of the 6600's central memory</span>
				<span class='text'>He then further increased the challenge in the later release the 5-fold faster [[CDC 7600]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}In 1963, in a ''Business Week'' article announcing the CDC 6600, Seymour Cray clearly expressed an idea that is often misattributed to [[Herb Grosch]] as so-called [[Grosch's law]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;Computers should obey a square law -- when the price doubles, you should get at least four times as much speed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;&quot;Computers get faster than ever,&quot; Business Week (31 August 1963): p</span>
				<span class='text'>28</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;====CDC's Chippewa Falls laboratory===={{No footnotes|section|date=May 2010}}During this period Cray had become increasingly annoyed at what he saw as interference from CDC management</span>
				<span class='text'>Cray always demanded an absolutely quiet work environment with a minimum of management overhead, but as the company grew he found himself constantly interrupted by middle managers who&amp;nbsp;— according to Cray&amp;nbsp;— did little but gawk and use him as a sales tool by introducing him to prospective customers</span>
				<span class='text'>ray decided that in order to continue development he would have to move from St</span>
				<span class='text'>Paul, far enough that it would be too long a drive for a &quot;quick visit&quot; and long distance telephone charges would be just enough to deter most calls, yet close enough that real visits or board meetings could be attended without too much difficulty</span>
				<span class='text'>After some debate, Norris backed him and set up a new laboratory on land Cray owned in his hometown of Chippewa Falls</span>
				<span class='text'>Some of the reason for the move may also have to do with Cray's worries about an impending [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]], which he felt made Minneapolis a serious safety concern</span>
				<span class='text'>His house, built a few hundred yards from the new CDC laboratory, included a huge [[fallout shelter|bomb shelter]]</span>
				<span class='text'>he new Chippewa Lab was set up in the middle of the 6600 project, although it does not seem to have delayed the project</span>
				<span class='text'>After the 6600 shipped, the successor [[CDC 7600]] system was the next product to be developed in Chippewa Falls, offering peak computational speeds of ten times the 6600</span>
				<span class='text'> The failed follow-on to the 7600, the [[CDC 8600]], was the project that finally ended his run of successes at CDC in 1972</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough the 6600 and 7600 had been huge successes in the end, both projects had almost bankrupted the company while they were being designed</span>
				<span class='text'>The 8600 was running into similar difficulties and Cray eventually decided that the only solution was to start over fresh</span>
				<span class='text'>This time Norris wasn't willing to take the risk, and another project within the company, the [[CDC STAR-100]] seemed to be progressing more smoothly</span>
				<span class='text'>Norris said he was willing to keep the project alive at a low level until the STAR was delivered, at which point full funding could be put into the 8600</span>
				<span class='text'>Cray was unwilling to work under these conditions and left the company</span>
				<span class='text'>==Cray Research==={{More footnotes|section|date=May 2010}}The split was fairly amicable, and when he started Cray Research in a new laboratory on the same Chippewa property a year later, Norris invested $300,000 in start-up money</span>
				<span class='text'>Like CDC's organization, Cray R&amp;D was based in Chippewa Falls and business headquarters were in Minneapolis</span>
				<span class='text'>Unlike CDC, Cray's manufacturing was also in Chippewa Falls</span>
				<span class='text'>t first there was some question as to what exactly the new company should do</span>
				<span class='text'>It did not seem that there would be any way for them to afford to develop a new computer, given that the now-large CDC had been unable to support more than one</span>
				<span class='text'>When the President in charge of financing traveled to [[Wall Street]] to look for [[seed capital]], he was surprised to find that Cray's reputation was very well known</span>
				<span class='text'>Far from struggling for some role to play in the market, the financial world was more than willing to provide Cray with all the money they would need to develop a new machine</span>
				<span class='text'>fter several years of development, their first product was released in 1976 as the [[Cray-1]]</span>
				<span class='text'>As with earlier Cray designs, the Cray-1 made sure that the ''entire'' computer was fast, as opposed to just the processor</span>
				<span class='text'>When it was released it easily beat almost every machine in terms of speed, including the STAR-100 that had beaten the 8600 for funding</span>
				<span class='text'>The only machine able to perform on the same sort of level was the [[ILLIAC IV]], a specialized one-off machine that rarely operated near its maximum performance, except on very specific tasks</span>
				<span class='text'>In general, the Cray-1 beat anything on the market by a wide margin</span>
				<span class='text'>erial number 001 was &quot;lent&quot; to [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] in 1976, and that summer the first full system was sold to the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] for $8</span>
				<span class='text'> million</span>
				<span class='text'>The company's early estimates had suggested that they might sell a dozen such machines, based on sales of similar machines from the CDC era, so the price was set accordingly</span>
				<span class='text'> Eventually, well over 80 Cray-1s were sold, and the company was a huge success financially</span>
				<span class='text'>ollow-up success was not so easy</span>
				<span class='text'>While he worked on the [[Cray-2]], other teams delivered the two-processor [[Cray X-MP]], which was another huge success and later the four-processor X-MP</span>
				<span class='text'>When the Cray-2 was finally released after six years of development it was only marginally faster than the X-MP, largely due to very fast and large main memory, and thus sold in much smaller numbers</span>
				<span class='text'> The Cray-2 ran at 250&amp;nbsp;MHz with a very deep pipeline, making it harder to code for than the shorter pipe X-MP</span>
				<span class='text'>s the [[Cray-3]] project started, he found himself once again being &quot;bothered&quot; too much with day-to-day tasks</span>
				<span class='text'>In order to concentrate on design, Cray left the CEO position of Cray Research in 1980 to become an independent contractor</span>
				<span class='text'> In 1988 Seymour moved the Cray 3 project from Chippewa Falls to a laboratory in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1989, Cray was faced with a repeat of history when the Cray-3 started to run into difficulties</span>
				<span class='text'>An upgrade of the X-MP using high-speed memory from the Cray-2 was under development and seemed to be making real progress, and once again management was faced with two projects and limited budgets</span>
				<span class='text'>They eventually decided to take the safer route, releasing the new design as the [[Cray Y-MP]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==Cray Computer Corporation==={{More footnotes|section|date=May 2010}}Cray decided to spin off the Colorado Springs laboratory to form '''Cray Computer Corporation''', taking the Cray-3 project with them</span>
				<span class='text'>he 500&amp;nbsp;MHz Cray-3 proved to be Cray's second major failure</span>
				<span class='text'>In order to provide the tenfold increase in performance that he always demanded of his newest machines, Cray decided that the machine would have to be built using [[gallium arsenide]] semiconductors</span>
				<span class='text'>In the past Cray had always avoided using anything even near the [[state of the art]], preferring to use well-known solutions and designing a fast machine based on them</span>
				<span class='text'>In this case, Cray was developing every part of the machine, even the chips inside it</span>
				<span class='text'>evertheless the team was able to get the machine working and installed their first example at NCAR</span>
				<span class='text'>The machine was still essentially a prototype, and the company was using the installation to debug the design</span>
				<span class='text'>By this time a number of [[massively parallel]] machines were coming into the market at price/performance points the Cray-3 could not touch</span>
				<span class='text'>Cray responded through &quot;brute force&quot;, starting design of the [[Cray-4]] which would run at 1&amp;nbsp;GHz and outpower these machines, regardless of price</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1995 there had been no further sales of the Cray-3, and the ending of the [[Cold War]] made it unlikely anyone would buy enough Cray-4s to offer a return on the development funds</span>
				<span class='text'>The company ran out of money and filed for Chapter 11 [[bankruptcy]] March 24, 1995</span>
				<span class='text'>==SRC Computers===Cray had always resisted the [[massively parallel]] solution to high-speed computing, offering a variety of reasons that it would never work as well as one very fast processor</span>
				<span class='text'>He famously quipped &quot;If you were plowing a field, which would you rather use: Two strong oxen or 1024 chickens?&quot; By the mid-1990s this argument was becoming increasingly difficult to justify, and modern [[compiler]] technology made developing programs on such machines not much more difficult than their simpler counterparts</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}Cray set up a new company, '''SRC Computers''', and started the design of his own massively parallel machine</span>
				<span class='text'>The new design concentrated on communications and memory performance, the bottleneck that hampered many parallel designs</span>
				<span class='text'>Design had just started when Cray died suddenly as a result of a car accident</span>
				<span class='text'>SRC Computers carried on development and now specializes in [[reconfigurable computing]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Technical approaches==Cray frequently cited two important aspects to his design philosophy: remove heat, and ensure that all signals that are supposed to arrive somewhere at the same time do indeed arrive at the same time</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Customer presentation by Seymour Cray, c1979&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--this is not a verifiable reference--&gt;His computers were equipped with built-in cooling systems, extending ultimately to coolant channels cast into the mainframes and thermally coupled to metal plates within the circuit boards, and to systems immersed in coolants</span>
				<span class='text'>In a story he told about himself, he realized early in his career that he should interlock the computers with the cooling systems so that the computers would not operate unless the cooling systems were operational</span>
				<span class='text'>It did not originally occur to him to interlock in the other direction until a customer reported that localized power outages had shut down their computer, but left the cooling system running&amp;nbsp;— so they arrived in the morning to find the machine encased in ice</span>
				<span class='text'>ray addressed the problem of [[clock skew|skew]] by ensuring that every signal path in his later computers was the same electrical length, so that values that were to be acted upon at a particular time were indeed all valid values</span>
				<span class='text'> When required, he would run the traces back and forth on the circuit boards until the desired length was achieved, and he even employed [[Maxwell's equations]] in design of the boards to ensure that any radio frequency effects which altered the signal velocity and hence the electrical path length were accounted for</span>
				<span class='text'>hen asked what kind of CAD tools he used for the Cray-1, Cray said that he liked #3 pencils with [[Graph paper|quad paper]] pads</span>
				<span class='text'>Cray recommended using the backs of the pages so that the lines were not so dominant</span>
				<span class='text'>When he was told that [[Apple Computer]] had just bought a Cray to help design the next [[Apple Macintosh]], Cray commented that he had just bought a Macintosh to design the next Cray</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;According to [[Jim Gray (computer scientist)|Jim Gray]] (quoted by [[C</span>
				<span class='text'>Gordon Bell]] in his [http://research</span>
				<span class='text'>icrosoft</span>

				<span class='text'>tm &quot;Seymour Cray Perspective&quot;])&lt;/ref&gt;==Personal life==Beyond the design of computers, Cray led a &quot;streamlined life&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He avoided publicity, and there are a number of unusual tales about his life away from work (termed &quot;Rollwagenisms&quot;, from then-CEO of Cray Research, John A</span>
				<span class='text'>Rollwagen)</span>
				<span class='text'>He enjoyed [[skiing]], [[wind surfing]], [[tennis]], and other sports</span>
				<span class='text'>Another favorite pastime was digging a tunnel under his home; he attributed the secret of his success to &quot;visits by [[elf|elves]]&quot; while he worked in the tunnel: &quot;While I'm digging in the tunnel, the elves will often come to me with solutions to my problem</span>
