				<span class='text'>Madison was crucial in persuading George Washington to attend the convention, since he knew how important the popular general would be to the adoption of a constitution</span>
				<span class='text'>As one of the first delegates to arrive, while waiting for the convention to begin, Madison wrote what became known as the [[Virginia Plan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Virginia Plan was submitted at the opening of the convention, and the work of the convention quickly became to amend the Virginia Plan and to fill in the gaps</span>

				<span class='text'>41–57&lt;/ref&gt; Though the Virginia Plan was an outline rather than a draft of a possible constitution, and though it was extensively changed during the debate (especially by [[John Rutledge]] and [[James Wilson]] in the [[Committee of Detail]]), its use at the convention led many to call Madison the &quot;Father of the Constitution&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>181&lt;/ref&gt; He was only 36 years old</span>
				<span class='text'>uring the course of the Convention, Madison spoke over two hundred times, and his fellow delegates rated him highly</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, William Pierce wrote that &quot;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>every Person seems to acknowledge his greatness</span>
				<span class='text'>In the management of every great question he evidently took the lead in the Convention </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>he always comes forward as the best informed Man of any point in debate</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Madison recorded the unofficial minutes of the convention, and these have become the only comprehensive record of what occurred</span>
				<span class='text'>The historian [[Clinton Rossiter]] regarded Madison's performance as &quot;a combination of learning, experience, purpose, and imagination that not even Adams or Jefferson could have equaled</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rutland, ''James Madison: The Founding Father,'' p</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Many have argued that this study helped prepare him for the convention</span>
				<span class='text'>[Gordon S</span>
				<span class='text'>Wood|Gordon Wood]], however, argues that Madison's frustrating experience in the Virginia legislature years earlier most shaped his constitutional views</span>
				<span class='text'>Wood notes that the governmental structure in both the Virginia Plan and the final constitution were not innovative, since they were copied from the British government, had been used in the states since 1776, and numerous authors had already argued for their adoption at the national level</span>

				<span class='text'>p</span>
				<span class='text'>183</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Most of what was controversial in the Virginia Plan was removed, and most of the rest had been commonly accepted as necessary for a functional government (state or national) for decades; thus, Madison's contribution was more qualitative</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;WoodGordon_a&quot; /&gt; Wood argues that, like most national politicians of the late 1780s, Madison believed that the problem was less with the Articles of Confederation than with the nature of the state legislatures</span>
				<span class='text'>He believed the solution was to restrain the excesses of the states</span>
				<span class='text'>This required more than an alteration in the Articles of Confederation; it required a change in the character of the national compact</span>
				<span class='text'>The ultimate question before the convention, Wood notes, was not how to design a government but whether the states should remain sovereign, whether sovereignty should be transferred to the national government, or whether the constitution should settle somewhere in between</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;WoodGordon_a&quot; /&gt;Those, like Madison, who thought democracy in the state legislatures was excessive and insufficiently &quot;disinterested&quot;, wanted sovereignty transferred to the national government, while those (like [[Patrick Henry]]) who did not think this a problem, wanted to fix the Articles of Confederation</span>
				<span class='text'>Madison was one of the only delegates who wanted to deprive the states of sovereignty completely, which he considered the only solution to the problem</span>
				<span class='text'>Though sharing the same goal as Madison, most other delegates reacted strongly against such an extreme change to the ''status quo</span>
				<span class='text'>' Though Madison lost most of his battles over how to amend the Virginia Plan (most importantly over the exclusion of the [[Council of Revision]]), in the process he increasingly shifted the debate away from a position of pure state sovereignty</span>
				<span class='text'>Since most disagreements over what to include in the constitution were ultimately disputes over the balance of sovereignty between the states and national government, Madison's influence was critical</span>
				<span class='text'>Wood notes that Madison's ultimate contribution was not in designing any particular constitutional framework, but in shifting the debate toward a compromise of &quot;shared sovereignty&quot; between the national and state governments</span>

				<span class='text'>182&lt;/ref&gt;==''The Federalist'' Papers and ratification debates=={{Main|The Federalist Papers}}Following the Constitutional Convention, there ensued an often times bitter battle over the [[United States Constitution|Consitution's]] [[History of the United States Constitution#Ratification of the Constitution|ratification]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Each state was requested to hold a special convention to deliberate and determine whether or not to ratify the Constitution</span>

				<span class='text'> ''Are We to be a Nation?'' p</span>
				<span class='text'>199, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA, 1987</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Madison was a leader in the ratification effort</span>
				<span class='text'>He, Alexander Hamilton and John Jay wrote ''The Federalist'' Papers, a series of 85 newspaper articles published in New York to explain how the proposed Constitution would work, mainly by responding to criticisms from anti-federalists</span>
				<span class='text'>They were also published in book form and became a virtual debater's handbook for the supporters of the Constitution in the ratifying conventions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Rossiter, Clinton, ed</span>
				<span class='text'> ''The Federalist Papers,'' p</span>
				<span class='text'>xiii, Penguin Putnam, Inc</span>
				<span class='text'> New York, NY, 1961</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The historian Clinton Rossiter called ''The Federalist'' Papers &quot;the most important work in political science that ever has been written, or is likely ever to be written, in the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rossiter, Clinton, ed</span>
				<span class='text'> ''The Federalist Papers,'' p</span>
				<span class='text'>ix, Penguin Putnam, Inc</span>
				<span class='text'> New York, NY, 1961</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; They were not scholarly arguments or impartial justifications for the constitution, but political polemics intended to assist the federalists in New York, which was the only state to have a coordinated anti-federalist movement</span>
				<span class='text'>One reason Madison was involved in the project was because he was a delegate to the lame duck Confederation Congress, which was meeting in New York</span>
				<span class='text'>f Virginia, the most populous state at the time, did not ratify the Constitution, the new national government would likely not succeed</span>
				<span class='text'>When the [[Virginia Ratifying Convention]] began on June 2, 1788, the Constitution had not yet been ratified by the required nine states</span>
				<span class='text'>New York, the second largest state and a bastion of anti-federalism, would likely not ratify it if Virginia rejected the constitution, and Virginia's exclusion from the new government would disqualify George Washington from being the first president</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;LabunskiRichard&quot;&gt;Labunski, Richard, ''James Madison and the Struggle for the Bill of Rights,'' p</span>
				<span class='text'>82</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Virginia delegates believed that Washington's election as the first president was an implicit condition for their acceptance of the new constitution and the new government</span>
				<span class='text'>Without Virginia, a new convention might have been held and a new constitution written in a much more polarized atmosphere, since the constitution did not specify what would happen if it was only partially ratified</span>
				<span class='text'>The states might have joined in regional confederacies or allied with Spain, France or Britain, which still had North American colonies</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Labunski, Richard, ''James Madison and the Struggle for the Bill of Rights,'' p</span>
				<span class='text'>3</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Arguably the most prominent anti-federalist, the powerful orator [[Patrick Henry]] was a delegate and had a following second only to Washington (who was not a delegate)</span>
				<span class='text'>Most delegates believed that most Virginians opposed the constitution</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;LabunskiRichard&quot; /&gt; Initially Madison did not want to stand for election to the Virginia ratifying convention, but was persuaded to do so because the situation looked so bad</span>
				<span class='text'>His role at the convention was likely critical to Virginia's ratification, and thus to the success of the constitution generally</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;LabunskiRichard&quot; /&gt;As the states were leery of creating a powerful central government, the drive to achieve ratification was difficult</span>
				<span class='text'>Patrick Henry feared that the constitution would trample on the independence of the states and the rights of citizens</span>
				<span class='text'>In the Virginia ratifying convention, Madison, who was a poor public speaker, had to go up against Henry, who was the most esteemed orator in the country</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Rutland, Robert Allen, ''James Madison: The Founding Father,'' pp</span>
				<span class='text'>36–39, University of Missouri Press, Columbia, MO, 1987</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Although Henry was by far the more powerful and dramatic speaker, Madison successfully matched him</span>
				<span class='text'>While Henry's arguments were emotional appeals to possible unintended consequences, Madison responded with rational answers to these claims; he eventually argued that Henry's claims were becoming absurd</span>
				<span class='text'>Madison pointed out that a limited government would be created, and that the powers delegated &quot;to the federal government are few and defined</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Samples, John, ''James Madison and the Future of Limited Government,'' pp</span>
				<span class='text'>25–42, Cato Institute, Washington, D</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> 2002</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Madison persuaded prominent figures such as [[Edmund Randolph]], who had refused to endorse the constitution at the convention, to change their position and support it at the ratifying convention</span>
				<span class='text'>Randolph's switch likely changed the votes of several more anti-federalists</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;LabunskiRichard_a&quot;&gt;Labunski, Richard, ''James Madison and the Struggle for the Bill of Rights,'' p</span>
				<span class='text'>135</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; When the vote was nearing, and the constitution still looked likely to be defeated, Madison pleaded with a small group of anti-federalists, and promised them he would push for a bill of rights later if they changed their votes</span>

				<span class='text'>A vengeful [[Patrick Henry]] wanted to deny Madison a seat in the new congress, so he ensured that Madison remained in the lame duck Confederation Congress to prevent him as long as possible from campaigning</span>
				<span class='text'>Henry used his power to keep the Virginia legislature from appointing Madison as one of the state's senators</span>
				<span class='text'>When Madison decided to run for election to the house instead, Henry gerrymandered Madison's home district, filling it with anti-federalists in an attempt to prevent Madison's election</span>
				<span class='text'>Madison could have run in another district, so to prevent this, Henry forced through a law requiring congressmen to live in the district they represent</span>
				<span class='text'>Later this was recognized as unconstitutional but, at the time, the law made it increasingly unlikely that Madison would be elected to congress</span>
				<span class='text'>He ran against [[James Monroe]], a future president, and traveled with Monroe while campaigning</span>
				<span class='text'>Later as president, Madison was told by some of his former constituents that, had it not been for unusually bad weather on election day, Monroe likely would have won</span>
				<span class='text'>Madison defeated Monroe and became an important leader in Congress</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Father of the Bill of Rights===Though the idea for a bill of rights had been suggested at the end of the constitutional convention, the delegates wanted to go home and thought the suggestion unnecessary</span>
				<span class='text'>The omission of a bill of rights became the main argument of the anti-federalists against the constitution</span>
				<span class='text'>Though no state conditioned ratification of the constitution on a bill of rights, several states came close, and the issue almost prevented the constitution from being ratified</span>
				<span class='text'>Some anti-federalists continued to contest this after the constitution had been ratified and threatened the entire nation with another constitutional convention</span>
				<span class='text'>This would likely have been far more partisan than the first</span>
				<span class='text'>Madison objected to a specific bill of rights&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, 1995, p</span>
				<span class='text'>130</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; for several reasons: he thought it was unnecessary, since it purported to protect against powers that the federal government had not been granted; that it was dangerous, since enumeration of some rights might be taken to imply the absence of other rights; and that at the state level, bills of rights had proven to be useless paper barriers against government powers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;Though few in the new congress wanted to debate a possible Bill of Rights (for the next century, most thought that the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], not the first ten constitutional amendments, constituted the true Bill of Rights), Madison pressed the issue</span>

				<span class='text'>&quot;James Madison and the Struggle for the Bill of Rights&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>p</span>
				<span class='text'>180&lt;/ref&gt; Congress was extremely busy with setting up the new government, most wanted to wait for the system to show its defects before amending the constitution, and the anti-federalist movements (which had demanded a new convention) had died out quickly once the constitution was ratified</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite this, Madison still feared that the states would compel congress to call for a new constitutional convention, which they had the right to do</span>
				<span class='text'>He also believed that the constitution did not sufficiently protect the national government from excessive democracy and parochialism (the defects he saw in the state governments), so he saw his amendments as a way to mitigate these problems</span>
				<span class='text'>On June 8, 1789, Madison introduced his bill proposing amendments consisting of Nine Articles comprising up to 20 Amendments, depending on how one counts</span>
				<span class='text'>Madison initially proposed that the amendments be incorporated into the body of the Constitution</span>
				<span class='text'>The House passed most of his slate of amendments, but rejected the idea of placing the amendments in the body of the Constitution</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, it adopted 17 amendments to be attached separately and sent this bill to the Senate</span>

				<span class='text'>The 1778 treaty of alliance with France was still in effect, yet most of the new country's trade was with Britain</span>
				<span class='text'>War with Britain seemed imminent in 1794, as the British seized hundreds of American ships that were trading with French colonies</span>
				<span class='text'>Madison believed that Britain was weak and the United States was strong, and that a trade war with Britain, although risking a real war by the British government, probably would succeed, and would allow Americans to assert their independence fully</span>
				<span class='text'>Great Britain, he charged, &quot;has bound us in commercial manacles, and very nearly defeated the object of our independence</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; As Varg explains, Madison discounted the much more powerful British army and navy for &quot;her interests can be wounded almost mortally, while ours are invulnerable</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The British West Indies, Madison maintained, could not live without American foodstuffs, but Americans could easily do without British manufactures</span>
				<span class='text'>This faith led him to the conclusion &quot;that it is in our power, in a very short time, to supply all the tonnage necessary for our own commerce&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; However, George Washington avoided a trade war and instead secured friendly trade relations with Britain through the [[Jay Treaty]] of 1794</span>
				<span class='text'>Madison threw his energies into fighting the Treaty—his mobilization of grassroots support helped form the [[First Party System]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He failed in both the Senate and House, and the Jay Treaty led to ten years of prosperous trade with Britain (and anger on the part of France leading to the Quasi-War)</span>

				<span class='text'>Following ratification of the Constitution and formation of the first government in 1789, two new political factions formed along similar lines as the old division</span>
				<span class='text'>The supporters of [[Alexander Hamilton]]'s attempts to strengthen the national government called themselves Federalists, while those who opposed Hamilton called themselves &quot;Republicans&quot; (later historians would refer to them as the [[Democratic-Republican party]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Madison and other Democratic Party organizers, who favored [[states' rights]] and local control, were struggling to find an institutional solution to the Constitution's seeming inability to prevent concentration of power in an [[administrative republic]]</span>

				<span class='text'>On September 15, 1794, James Madison married [[Dolley Payne Todd]], a 26-year-old widow, at [[Harewood (West Virginia)|Harewood]], in what is now [[Jefferson County, West Virginia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;amadison&quot;/&gt; Madison had no children but did adopt Todd's one surviving son, [[John Payne Todd]] (known as Payne), after the marriage</span>
				<span class='text'>olley Payne was born May 20, 1768, at the New Garden [[Quaker]] settlement in North Carolina, where her parents, John Payne and Mary Coles Payne, lived briefly</span>
				<span class='text'>Dolley's sister, [[Lucy Washington|Lucy Payne]], had recently married [[George Steptoe Washington]], a nephew of President Washington</span>
				<span class='text'>As a member of Congress, Madison had doubtless met the widow Todd at social functions in Philadelphia, then the nation's capital</span>
				<span class='text'>She had been living there with her late husband</span>
				<span class='text'>In May 1794, Madison asked their mutual friend [[Aaron Burr]] to arrange a meeting</span>
				<span class='text'>By August, she had accepted his proposal of marriage</span>
				<span class='text'>For marrying Madison, a non-Quaker, she was expelled from the [[Religious Society of Friends|Society of Friends]]</span>
				<span class='text'>hey were known to have a happy marriage</span>
				<span class='text'>Dolley Madison put her social gifts to use when the couple lived in Washington, beginning when he was Secretary of State</span>
				<span class='text'>With the White House still under construction, she advised as to its furnishings and sometimes served as First Lady for ceremonial functions for President Thomas Jefferson, a widower and their friend</span>
				<span class='text'>When her husband was president, she created the role of First Lady, using her social talents to advance his program</span>
				<span class='text'>She is credited with adding to his popularity in office</span>

				<span class='text'>At the start of his term, Madison was a party to the [[United States Supreme Court]] case ''[[Marbury v</span>
				<span class='text'>Madison]]'' (1803), in which the doctrine of [[judicial review]] was asserted by the high Court, much to the annoyance of the Jeffersonians who did not want a powerful federalist judiciary</span>
				<span class='text'>The main challenge to the Jefferson Administration was maintaining neutrality during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Throughout Jefferson's presidency, much of Europe was at war, at first between [[France]] and [[Austria]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] in 1805, where France decisively defeated the Austrian [[Habsburg]]s, the conflict transformed into a grinding war between France and Britain</span>
				<span class='text'>hortly before Jefferson's election, [[Napoleon]] had seized power from the hapless [[French Directory]], which had recently mismanaged France's finances in unsuccessful wars and had lost control of [[Saint-Domingue]] (Haiti) after a slave rebellion</span>
				<span class='text'>Beginning in 1802, Napoleon sent more than 20,000 troops to try to restore slavery on the island, as its colonial sugar cane plantations had been the chief revenue producer for France in the New World</span>
				<span class='text'>The warfare went badly and the troops were further decimated by [[yellow fever]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Napoleon gave up on thoughts of restoring the empire and sold the Louisiana territory to Madison and Jefferson in 1803</span>
				<span class='text'>Later that year, the 7,000 surviving French troops were withdrawn from the island, and in 1804 [[Haiti]] declared its independence as the second republic in the western hemisphere</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:louisiana purchase treaty</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|The original treaty of the Louisiana Purchase]]Many contemporaries and later historians, such as [[Ron Chernow]], noted that Madison and President Jefferson ignored their &quot;strict construction&quot; view of the Constitution to take advantage of the purchase opportunity</span>
				<span class='text'>Jefferson would have preferred to have a constitutional amendment authorizing the purchase, but did not have time nor was he required to do so</span>

				<span class='text'>as a neutral under international law</span>
				<span class='text'>either London nor Paris showed much respect, however, and the situation deteriorated during Jefferson's second term</span>
				<span class='text'>After Napoleon achieved victory at Austerlitz over his enemies in continental Europe, he became more aggressive and tried to starve Britain into submission with an embargo that was economically ruinous to both sides</span>
				<span class='text'>Madison and Jefferson had also decided on an embargo to punish Britain and France, which forbade American trade with any foreign nation</span>
				<span class='text'>The embargo failed in the United States just as it did in France, and caused massive hardships up and down the seaboard, which depended on foreign trade</span>
				<span class='text'>The Federalists made a comeback in the Northeast by attacking the embargo, which was allowed to expire just as Jefferson was leaving office</span>
