				<span class='text'>Along with [[Le Corbusier]], [[Walter Gropius]] and [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], he is widely regarded as one of the pioneers of [[modern architecture]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ies, like many of his post-[[World War I]] contemporaries, sought to establish a new architectural style that could represent modern times just as [[Classical architecture|Classical]] and [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] did for their own eras</span>
				<span class='text'>He created an influential twentieth-century architectural style, stated with extreme clarity and simplicity</span>
				<span class='text'>His mature buildings made use of modern materials such as industrial steel and [[plate glass]] to define interior spaces</span>
				<span class='text'>He strove toward an architecture with a minimal framework of structural order balanced against the implied freedom of free-flowing open space</span>
				<span class='text'>He called his buildings &quot;skin and bones&quot; architecture</span>
				<span class='text'>He sought a rational approach that would guide the creative process of architectural design, but he was always concerned with expressing the spirit of the modern era</span>
				<span class='text'>He is often associated with his quotation of the aphorisms, &quot;[[Less is more (architecture)|less is more]]&quot; and &quot;[[God is in the detail]]s&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>=Early career==Mies was born in [[Aachen]], Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>He worked in his father's [[stone carving]] shop and at several local design firms before he moved to [[Berlin]], where he joined the office of [[interior design]]er [[Bruno Paul]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He began his architectural career as an [[apprentice]] at the studio of [[Peter Behrens]] from 1908 to 1912, where he was exposed to the current design theories and to progressive [[German culture]], working alongside [[Walter Gropius]] and [[Le Corbusier]], who were later also involved in the development of the [[Bauhaus]]</span>

				<span class='text'>A physically imposing, deliberative, and reticent man, Ludwig Mies renamed himself as part of his rapid transformation from a tradesman's son to an architect working with Berlin's cultural elite, adding &quot;van der&quot; and his mother's surname &quot;Rohe&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|[[Barcelona Pavilion]], 1929</span>
				<span class='text'>(reconstruction)]]After [[World War I]], Mies began, while still designing traditional neoclassical homes, a parallel experimental effort</span>
				<span class='text'>He joined his avant-garde peers in the long-running search for a new style that would be suitable for the modern industrial age</span>
				<span class='text'>The weak points of traditional styles had been under attack by progressive theorists since the mid-nineteenth century, primarily for the contradictions of hiding modern construction technology with a facade of ornamented traditional styles</span>
				<span class='text'>he mounting criticism of the historical styles gained substantial cultural credibility after World War I, a disaster widely seen as a failure of the old world order of imperial leadership of Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>The aristocratic classical revival styles were particularly reviled by many as the architectural symbol of a now-discredited and outmoded social system</span>
				<span class='text'>Progressive thinkers called for a completely new architectural design process guided by rational problem-solving and an exterior expression of modern materials and structure rather than, what they considered, the superficial application of classical facades</span>
				<span class='text'>hile continuing his traditional neoclassical design practice Mies began to develop visionary projects that, though mostly unbuilt, rocketed him to fame as an architect capable of giving form that was in harmony with the spirit of the emerging modern society</span>
				<span class='text'>Boldly abandoning ornament altogether, Mies made a dramatic modernist debut with his stunning competition proposal for the faceted all-glass [[Friedrichstraße]] skyscraper in 1921, followed by a taller curved version in 1922 named the Glass Skyscraper</span>

				<span class='text'>Conceived as a kind of minaret alongside the squat, monumental Grande Arche de La Défense, &lt;u&gt;the endless tower has taken on some of the mystique of Mies van der Rohe’s unbuilt Friedrichstrasse glass skyscraper of 1921&lt;/u&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'>To obscure its lower end, the tower was designed to sit within a crater</span>
				<span class='text'>Its facade, appearing to vanish in the sky, changed as it rose, from charcoal-colored granite to paler stone, then to aluminum and finally to glass that became increasingly reflective, all to enhance the illusion of dematerialization</span>

				<span class='text'>e joined the German avant-garde, working with the progressive design magazine ''G'' which started in July 1923</span>
				<span class='text'>He developed prominence as architectural director of the [[Deutscher Werkbund|Werkbund]], organizing the influential [[Weissenhof Estate]] prototype modernist housing exhibition</span>
				<span class='text'>He was also one of the founders of the architectural association [[Der Ring]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He joined the avant-garde [[Bauhaus]] design school as their director of architecture, adopting and developing their functionalist application of simple geometric forms in the design of useful objects</span>
				<span class='text'>He served as its last director</span>
				<span class='text'>ike many other avant-garde architects of the day, Mies based his architectural mission and principles on his understanding and interpretation of ideas developed by theorists and critics who pondered the declining relevance of the traditional design styles</span>
				<span class='text'>He selectively adopted theoretical ideas such as the aesthetic credos of [[Russia]]n [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] with their ideology of &quot;efficient&quot; sculptural assembly of modern industrial materials</span>
				<span class='text'>Mies found appeal in the use of simple rectilinear and planar forms, clean lines, pure use of color, and the extension of space around and beyond interior walls expounded by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[De Stijl]] group</span>
				<span class='text'>In particular, the layering of functional sub-spaces within an overall space and the distinct articulation of parts as expressed by [[Gerrit Rietveld]] appealed to Mies</span>
				<span class='text'>he design theories of [[Adolf Loos]] found resonance with Mies, particularly the ideas of replacing elaborate applied artistic ornament with the straightforward display of innate visual qualities of materials and forms</span>
				<span class='text'>Loos had proposed that art and crafts should be entirely independent of architecture, that the architect should no longer control those cultural elements as the Beaux Arts principles had dictated</span>
				<span class='text'>Mies also admired his ideas about the nobility that could be found in the anonymity of modern life</span>
				<span class='text'>he bold work of American architects was greatly admired by European architects</span>
				<span class='text'>Like other architects who viewed the exhibitions of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]'s [[Wasmuth Portfolio]], Mies was enthralled with the free-flowing spaces of inter-connected rooms which encompass their outdoor surroundings as demonstrated by the open floor plans of the Wright's American [[Prairie School|Prairie Style]]</span>
				<span class='text'>American engineering structures were also held up to be exemplary of the beauty possible in functional construction, and its skyscrapers were greatly admired</span>
				<span class='text'>=Significance and meaning==Mies pursued an ambitious lifelong mission to create a new architectural language that could be used to represent the new era of technology and production</span>
				<span class='text'>He saw a need for an architecture expressive of and in harmony with his epoch, just as [[Gothic architecture]] was for an era of spiritualism</span>
				<span class='text'>He applied a disciplined design process using rational thought to achieve his spiritual goals</span>
				<span class='text'>He believed that the configuration and arrangement of every architectural element, particularly including the character of enclosed space, must contribute to a unified expression</span>
				<span class='text'>One notable way that Mies connected his buildings with nature was by extending outdoor plaza tiles into the floor of a lobby, synthesizing the exterior and interior spaces of the site</span>
				<span class='text'>The device accentuated the effortless flow between natural conditions and artificial structures</span>
				<span class='text'>This characteristic is often found in his large building projects such as the [[Seagram Building]]</span>
				<span class='text'>he self-educated Mies painstakingly studied the great philosophers and thinkers, past and present, to enhance his own understanding of the character and essential qualities of the technological times he lived in</span>
				<span class='text'>More than perhaps any other practising pioneer of modernism, Mies mined the writings of philosophers and thinkers for ideas that were relevant to his architectural mission</span>
				<span class='text'>Mies' architecture was guided by principles at a high level of abstraction, and his own generalized descriptions of those principles intentionally leave much room for interpretation</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet his buildings are executed as objects of beauty and craftsmanship, and seem very direct and simple when viewed in person</span>
				<span class='text'>very aspect of his architecture, from overall concept to the smallest detail, supports his effort to express the modern age</span>
				<span class='text'>The depth of meaning conveyed by his work, beyond its aesthetic qualities, has drawn many contemporary philosophers and theoretical thinkers to continue to further explore and speculate about his architecture</span>
				<span class='text'>=Emigration to the United States==Commission opportunities dwindled with the -[[Great Depression]] after 1929</span>
				<span class='text'>Starting in 1930, Mies served as the last director of the faltering [[Bauhaus]], at the request of his colleague and competitor [[Walter Gropius]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1932, [[Nazi]] political pressure forced the state-supported school to leave its campus in Dessau, and Mies moved it to an abandoned telephone factory in Berlin</span>
				<span class='text'>By 1933, however, the continued operation of the school was untenable (it was raided by the [[Gestapo]] in April), and in July of that year, Mies and the faculty voted to close the Bauhaus</span>
				<span class='text'>He built very little in these years (one built commission was [[Philip Johnson]]'s New York apartment); the Nazis rejected his style as not &quot;German&quot; in character</span>
				<span class='text'>rustrated and unhappy, he left his homeland reluctantly in 1937 as he saw his opportunity for any future building commissions vanish, accepting a residential commission in [[Wyoming]] and then an offer to head the department of architecture of the newly established [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] (IIT) in Chicago</span>
				<span class='text'>There he introduced a new kind of education and attitude later known as [[Chicago School (architecture)|Second Chicago School]], which became very influential in the following decades in North America and Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>=Career in the United States==[[File:2004-09-02 1580x2800 chicago IBM building</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|[[IBM Plaza]], Chicago, Illinois]]Mies settled in Chicago, Illinois where he was appointed head of the architecture school at Chicago's Armour Institute of Technology (later renamed [[Illinois Institute of Technology]])</span>
				<span class='text'>One of the benefits of taking this position was that he would be commissioned to design the new buildings and master plan for the campus</span>

				<span class='text'>n 1944, he became an American citizen, completing his severance from his native Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>His thirty years as an American architect reflect a more structural, pure approach toward achieving his goal of a new architecture for the twentieth century</span>
				<span class='text'>He focused his efforts on enclosing open and adaptable &quot;universal&quot; spaces with clearly arranged structural frameworks, featuring prefabricated steel shapes filled in with large sheets of glass</span>
				<span class='text'>is early projects at the IIT campus, and for developer [[Herbert Greenwald]], presented to Americans a style that seemed a natural progression of the almost forgotten nineteenth century [[Chicago school (architecture)|Chicago School]] style</span>
				<span class='text'>His architecture, with origins in the German Bauhaus and western European [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]], became an accepted mode of building for American cultural and educational institutions, developers, public agencies, and large corporations</span>

				<span class='text'>The towers were simple rectangular boxes with a non-hierarchical wall enclosure, raised on stilts above a glass-enclosed lobby</span>
				<span class='text'>he lobby is set back from the perimeter columns, which were exposed around the perimeter of the building above, creating a modern [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]] not unlike those of the Greek temples</span>
				<span class='text'>This configuration created a feeling of light, openness, and freedom of movement at the ground level that became the prototype for countless new towers designed both by Mies's office and his followers</span>
				<span class='text'>Some historians argue that this new approach is an expression of the American spirit and the boundless open space of the frontier, which German culture so admired</span>
				<span class='text'>nce Mies had established his basic design concept for the general form and details of his tower buildings, he applied those solutions (with evolving refinements) to his later high-rise building projects</span>
				<span class='text'>The architecture of his towers appears to be similar, but each project represents new ideas about the formation of highly sophisticated urban space at ground level</span>
				<span class='text'>He delighted in the composition of multiple towers arranged in a seemingly casual non-hierarchical relation to each other</span>
				<span class='text'>ust as with his interiors, he created free flowing spaces and flat surfaces that represented the idea of an oasis of uncluttered clarity and calm within the chaos of the city</span>
				<span class='text'>He included nature by leaving openings in the pavement, through which plants seem to grow unfettered by urbanization, just as in the pre-settlement environment</span>
				<span class='text'>==Seagram Building==={{Main|Seagram Building}}In 1958, Mies van der Rohe designed what is often regarded as the pinnacle of the modernist high-rise architecture, the [[Seagram Building]] in [[New York City]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Mies was chosen by the daughter of the client, [[Phyllis Lambert|Phyllis Bronfman Lambert]], who has become a noted architectural figure and patron in her own right</span>
				<span class='text'>The Seagram Building has become an icon of the growing power of the corporation, that defining institution of the twentieth century</span>
				<span class='text'>In a bold and innovative move, the architect chose to set the tower back from the [[property line]] to create a forecourt plaza and fountain on [[Park Avenue (Manhattan)|Park Avenue]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough now acclaimed and widely influential as an urban design feature, Mies had to convince Bronfman's bankers that a taller tower with significant &quot;unused&quot; open space at ground level would enhance the presence and prestige of the building</span>
				<span class='text'>Mies' design included a bronze curtain wall with external H-shaped [[mullion]]s that were exaggerated in depth beyond what was structurally necessary</span>
				<span class='text'>Detractors criticized it as having committed Adolf Loos's &quot;[[Ornament and Crime|crime of ornamentation]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip Johnson had a role in interior materials selections, and he designed the sumptuous [[Four Seasons Restaurant]], which has endured un-remodeled to today</span>
				<span class='text'>The Seagram Building is said to be an early example of the innovative &quot;fast-track&quot; construction process, where design documentation and construction are done concurrently</span>
				<span class='text'>sing the Seagram as a prototype, Mies' office designed a number of modern [[high-rise]] office towers, notably the [[Chicago Federal Center]], which includes the [[Dirksen Federal Building|Dirksen]] and [[Kluczynski Federal Building|Kluczynski]] Federal Buildings and [[United States Post Office Loop Station|Post Office]] (1959) and the [[IBM Plaza]] in Chicago; the [[Westmount Square]] in Montreal, and the [[Toronto-Dominion Centre]] in 1967</span>
				<span class='text'>Each project applies the prototype rectangular form on stilts and ever-more refined enclosure wall systems, but each creates a unique set of exterior spaces that are an essential aspect of his creative efforts</span>
				<span class='text'>uring 1951–1952, Mies' designed the steel, glass, and brick [[Robert H</span>
				<span class='text'>McCormick House|McCormick House]], located in [[Elmhurst, Illinois]] (15 miles west of the Chicago Loop), for real-estate developer Robert Hall McCormick, Jr</span>
				<span class='text'>A one-story adaptation of the exterior curtain wall of his famous 860–880 Lake Shore Drive towers, it served as a prototype for an unbuilt series of speculative houses to be constructed in Melrose Park, Illinois</span>
				<span class='text'>The house has been moved and reconfigured as a part of the public [[Elmhurst Art Museum]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also built a residence for John M</span>
				<span class='text'>van Beuren on a family estate near Morristown, New Jersey</span>
				<span class='text'>==Museum of Fine Arts, Houston===[[File:Museum of Fine Arts Houston</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Caroline Weiss Law Building in Houston, Texas]]Mies designed two buildings for the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Houston]] (MFAH) as additions to the Caroline Weiss Law Building</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1953, the MFAH commissioned Mies van der Rohe to create a master plan for the institution</span>
				<span class='text'>He designed two additions to the building—Cullinan Hall, completed in 1958, and the Brown Pavilion, completed in 1974</span>
				<span class='text'>A renowned example of the International Style, these portions of the Caroline Wiess Law Building comprise one of only two Mies-designed museums in the world</span>

				<span class='text'>Considered one of the most perfect statements of his architectural approach, the upper pavilion is a precise composition of monumental steel columns and a cantilevered (overhanging) roof plane with a glass enclosure</span>
				<span class='text'>The simple square glass pavilion is a powerful expression of his ideas about flexible interior space, defined by transparent walls and supported by an external structural frame</span>
				<span class='text'>Art installations by [[Ulrich Rückriem]] (1998) or [[Jenny Holzer]], as much as exhibitions on the work of [[Renzo Piano]] or [[Rem Koolhaas]] have demonstrated the exceptional possibilities of this space</span>
				<span class='text'>he glass pavilion is a relatively small portion of the overall building, serving as a symbolic architectural entry point and monumental gallery for temporary exhibits</span>
				<span class='text'>A large podium building below the pavilion accommodates most of the museum's total built area with conventional white-walled art gallery spaces and support functions</span>
				<span class='text'>A large window running along all the West facade opens these spaces up to the large sculpture garden which is part of the podium building</span>
				<span class='text'>=Furniture==Mies designed [[modern furniture]] pieces using new industrial technologies that have become popular classics, such as the [[Barcelona chair]] and table, the [[Brno chair]], and the [[Tugendhat chair]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His furniture is known for fine [[Artisan|craftsmanship]], a mix of traditional luxurious [[fabrics]] like [[leather]] combined with modern [[Chrome plating|chrome]] frames, and a distinct separation of the supporting structure and the supported surfaces, often employing [[cantilever]]s to enhance the feeling of lightness created by delicate structural frames</span>
				<span class='text'>During this period, he collaborated closely with [[interior designer]] and companion [[Lilly Reich]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Educator==Mies served as the last director of Berlin's [[Bauhaus]], and then headed the department of architecture, [[Illinois Institute of Technology]]  in Chicago, where he developed the [[Chicago school (architecture)|Second Chicago School]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He played a significant role as an educator, believing his architectural language could be learned, then applied to design any type of modern building</span>
				<span class='text'>He set up a new education at the department of architecture of the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] in Chicago replacing the traditional [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Ecole des Beaux-Art]] curriculum by a three-step-education beginning with crafts of drawing and construction leading to planning skills and finishing with theory of architecture (compare [[Vitruvius]]: firmitas, utilitas, venustas)</span>
				<span class='text'>He worked personally and intensively on prototype solutions, and then allowed his students, both in school and his office, to develop derivative solutions for specific projects under his guidance</span>
				<span class='text'>ome of Mies' curriculum is still put in practice in the first and second year programs at IIT, including the precise drafting of brick construction details so unpopular with aspiring student architects</span>
				<span class='text'>When none was able to match the quality of his own work, he agonized about where his educational method had gone wrong</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, his achievements in creating a teachable architecture language that can be used to express the modern technological era survives until today</span>
				<span class='text'>ies placed great importance on education of architects who could carry on his design principles</span>
				<span class='text'>He devoted a great deal of time and effort leading the architecture program at IIT</span>
				<span class='text'>Mies served on the initial Advisory Board of the [[Graham Foundation]] in Chicago</span>
				<span class='text'>His own practice was based on intensive personal involvement in design efforts to create prototype solutions for building types (860 Lake Shore Drive, the Farnsworth House, Seagram Building, S</span>
				<span class='text'>R</span>
				<span class='text'>Crown Hall, The New National Gallery), then allowing his studio designers to develop derivative buildings under his supervision</span>
				<span class='text'>ies's grandson [[Dirk Lohan]] and two partners led the firm after he died in 1969</span>
				<span class='text'>Lohan, who had collaborated with Mies on the New National Gallery, continued with existing projects but soon led the firm on his own independent path</span>
				<span class='text'>Other disciples continued Mies's architectural language for years, notably Gene Summers, David Haid, Myron Goldsmith, Y</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Wong, Jacques Brownson, and other architects at the firms of [[C</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Murphy]] and [[Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ut while Mies' work had enormous influence and critical recognition, his approach failed to sustain a creative force as a style after his death and was eclipsed by the new wave of [[Postmodern architecture|Post Modernism]] by the 1980s</span>
				<span class='text'>Proponents of the Post Modern style attacked the Modernism with clever statements such as &quot;less is a bore&quot; and with captivating images such as Crown Hall sinking in Lake Michigan</span>
				<span class='text'>Mies had hoped his architecture would serve as a universal model that could be easily imitated, but the aesthetic power of his best buildings proved impossible to match, instead resulting mostly in drab and uninspired structures rejected by the general public</span>
				<span class='text'>The failure of his followers to meet his high standard may have contributed to demise of Modernism and the rise of new competing design theories following his death</span>
