				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars hold that Ezra lived during the rule of Artaxerxes I, though some have difficulties with this assumption:&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; Nehemiah and Ezra &quot;seem to have no knowledge of each other; their missions do not overlap&quot;, however, in Nehemiah 12, both are leading processions on the wall as part of the wall dedication ceremony</span>
				<span class='text'> So, they clearly were contemporaries working together in Jerusalem at the time the wall and the city of Jerusalem was rebuilt in contrast to the previously stated viewpoint</span>
