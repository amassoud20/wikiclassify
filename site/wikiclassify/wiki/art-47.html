				<span class='text'> In March 1492 the Medici dispatched the thirty eight year old Vespucci and Donato Niccolini as confidential agents to look into the Medici branch office in  Spain whose managers and dealings were under suspicion</span>

				<span class='text'> Just around this time 1495–96 Vespucci was engaged as the executor of Giannotto Berardi an Italian merchant who had recently died in Seville</span>
				<span class='text'>Vespucci organized the fulfillment of Berardis outstanding contract with the Castilian crown to provide twelve vessels for the Indies</span>
				<span class='text'>name   markham   After these were delivered Vespucci continued as a provision contractor for Indies expeditions and is known to have secured beef supplies for at least one if not two of Columbus voyages</span>
				<span class='text'>name   markham ExpeditionsAt the invitation of king  Vespucci participated as observer in several voyages that explored the east coast of  between 1499 and 1502</span>
				<span class='text'>On the first of these voyages he was aboard the ship that discovered that South America extended much further south than previously thought</span>
				<span class='text'>he expeditions became widely known in Europe after two accounts attributed to Vespucci were published between 1502 and 1504</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1507  produced a world map on which he named the new continent  after the feminine Latin version of Vespuccis first name which is Americus</span>
				<span class='text'>In an accompanying book Waldseemüller published one of the Vespucci accounts which led to criticism that Vespucci was trying to upset  glory</span>
				<span class='text'>However the rediscovery in the 18th century of other letters by Vespucci has led to the view that the early published accounts notably the  could be fabrications not by Vespucci but by others</span>

				<span class='text'>Lettera di Amerigo Vespucci delle isole nuovamente trovate in quattro suoi viaggi Letter of Amerigo Vespucci concerning the isles newly discovered on his four voyages known as Lettera al Soderini or just Lettera was a letter in Italian addressed to </span>
				<span class='text'>Printed in 1504 or 1505 it claimed to be an account of four voyages to the Americas made by Vespucci between 1497 and 1504</span>
				<span class='text'>A Latin translation was published by the German  in 1507 in  a book on  and  as Quattuor Americi Vespucij navigationes Four Voyages of Amerigo Vespucci</span>
				<span class='text'>name formisano On March 22 1508  made Vespucci chief navigator of Spain at a huge salaryOber p</span>
				<span class='text'>234  and commissioned him to found a school of navigation in order to standardize and modernize navigation techniques used by Iberian sea captains then exploring the world</span>
				<span class='text'>Vespucci even developed a rudimentary but fairly accurate method of determining longitude which only more accurate chronometers would later improve upon</span>
				<span class='text'>n the 18th century three unpublished familiar letters from Vespucci to Lorenzo de Medici were rediscovered</span>
				<span class='text'>One describes a voyage made in 1499–1500 which corresponds with the second of the four voyages</span>
				<span class='text'>Another was written from  in 1501 in the early part of the third of the four voyages before crossing the Atlantic</span>
				<span class='text'>The third letter was sent from Lisbon after the completion of that voyage</span>
				<span class='text'>name formisano Some have suggested that Vespucci in the two letters published in his lifetime was exaggerating his role and constructed deliberate fabrications</span>
				<span class='text'>However many scholars now believe that the two letters were not written by him but were fabrications by others based in part on genuine letters by Vespucci</span>
				<span class='text'>t was the publication and widespread circulation of the letters that might have led Waldseemüller to name the new continent  on his world map of 1507 in </span>
				<span class='text'>Vespucci used a  form of his name Americus Vespucius in his  writings which Waldseemüller used as a base for the new name taking the feminine form America according to the prevalent view for other hypotheses see the footnote in the introduction</span>
				<span class='text'>The book accompanying the map stated I do not see what right any one would have to object to calling this part after Americus who discovered it and who is a man of intelligence Amerige that is the Land of Americus or America since both Europa and Asia got their names from women</span>
				<span class='text'> It is possible that Vespucci was not aware that Waldseemüller had named the continent after him</span>
				<span class='text'>ay p</span>
				<span class='text'>3 The two disputed letters claim that Vespucci made four voyages to America while at most two can be verified from other sources</span>
				<span class='text'>At the moment there is a dispute between historians on when Vespucci visited the mainland the first time</span>
				<span class='text'>Some historians like Germán Arciniegas and Gabriel Camargo Pérez think that his first voyage was made in June 1497 with the Spanish Pilot Juan de la Cosa</span>
				<span class='text'>espuccis real historical importance may well rest more in his letters whether he wrote them all or not than in his discoveries</span>
				<span class='text'>From these letters the European public learned about the newly discovered continents of the Americas for the first time its existence became generally known throughout Europe within a few years of the letters publication</span>
				<span class='text'>oyagesThe first and fourth voyages are disputed to have occurred while the second and third are certain voyages</span>
				<span class='text'> letter published in 1504 purports to be an account by Vespucci written to Soderini of a lengthy visit to the New World leaving Spain in May 1497 and returning in October 1498</span>
				<span class='text'> However modern scholars have doubted that this voyage took place and consider this letter a forgery</span>
				<span class='text'>  Whoever did write the letter makes several observations of native customs including use of s and s</span>
				<span class='text'> The names of Amerigo Vespuccis ships were the San Antiago Repertaga Wegiz and the Girmand</span>
				<span class='text'>bout 1499–1500 Vespucci joined an expedition in the service of Spain with  or Hojeda as the fleet commander</span>
				<span class='text'>The intention was to sail around the southern end of the African mainland into the </span>
				<span class='text'>name OGorman  After hitting land at the coast of what is now  the two seem to have separated</span>
				<span class='text'>Vespucci sailed southward discovering the mouth of the  and reaching 6°S before turning around and seeing  and the  and returning to Spain by way of </span>
				<span class='text'>The letter to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de Medici claims that Vespucci determined his longitude celestially name Vcelest   on a rainy and stormy day with calm seas stars could be identified   near the horizon to judge     celestially</span>
				<span class='text'>Although South Americas    drops quickly into the deep ocean beyond the    the mouth is on the shelf avoiding the ocean swells   and waves which hinder visibility of stars near the   horizon</span>
				<span class='text'> Seamen who could navigate from Europe to America   and back could chart stars on the horizon especially   for a  like Vespucci</span>
				<span class='text'>on August 23 1499 while on this voyage</span>
				<span class='text'>However that claim may be fraudulent name Vcelest  which could cast doubt on the letters credibility</span>
				<span class='text'>he last certain voyage of Vespucci was led by  in 1501–1502 in the service of </span>
				<span class='text'>Departing from  the fleet sailed first to  where they met two of s ships returning from </span>
				<span class='text'>In a letter from Cape Verde Vespucci says that he hopes to visit the same lands that Álvares Cabral had explored suggesting that the intention is to sail west to Asia as on the 1499–1500 voyage</span>
				<span class='text'>name OGorman  On reaching the coast of  they sailed south along the coast of  to s bay</span>
				<span class='text'>If his own account is to be believed he reached the latitude of  before turning back although this also seems doubtful since his account does not mention the broad estuary of the  which he must have seen if he had gotten that far south</span>
				<span class='text'>Portuguese maps of South America created after the voyage of Coelho and Vespucci do not show any land south of present day  at 25° S so this may represent the southernmost extent of their voyages</span>
				<span class='text'>fter the first half of the expedition Vespucci mapped  and  as well as the   the Southern Cross and the Coalsack Nebula</span>

				<span class='text'>47 pp</span>
				<span class='text'>535–543</span>
				<span class='text'> Although these s had been known to the ancient  gradual  had lowered them below the an horizon so that they had been forgotten</span>
				<span class='text'>On his return to Lisbon Vespucci wrote in a letter to Medici that the land masses they explored were much larger than anticipated and different from the Asia described by  or  and theore must be a New World that is a previously unknown fourth continent after Europe Asia and Africa</span>
				<span class='text'>espuccis fourth voyage was another expedition for the Portuguese crown down the eastern coast of Brazil that set out in May 1503 and returned to Portugal in June 1504</span>
				<span class='text'>Like his alleged first voyage Vespuccis last voyage in 1503–1504 is also disputed to have taken place</span>
				<span class='text'>ay p</span>
				<span class='text'>1   The only source of information for the last voyage is the Letter to SoderiniMarkham pp</span>
				<span class='text'>2–56  but as several modern scholars dispute Vespuccis authorship of the letter to Soderini it is also sometimes doubted whether Vespucci undertook this trip</span>
				<span class='text'> However Portuguese documents do confirm a voyage to Brazil was undertaken in 1503–04 by the captain  very likely the same captain of the 1501 mapping expedition Vespuccis third voyage and so it is quite possible that Vespucci went on board this one as well</span>
				<span class='text'>ernández Armesto 2007 p</span>
				<span class='text'>68 69</span>
				<span class='text'>  However it is not independently confirmed Vespucci was aboard and there are some difficulties in the reported dates and details</span>
				<span class='text'>he letters caused controversy after Vespuccis death especially among the supporters of Columbus who believed Columbus priority for the discovery of America was being undermined and seriously damaged Vespuccis reputation</span>

				<span class='text'>The question of the authenticity of Vespuccis authorship of the 1504 Mundus Novus and the 1505 Letter of Soderini the only two texts published in Vespuccis lifetime was famously raised by Magnaghi 1924</span>
				<span class='text'>He proposed the Soderini letter was not written by Vespucci but rather cobbled together by unscrupulous Florentine publishers cutting and pasting together various accounts some from Vespucci others from elsewhere</span>
				<span class='text'>Magnaghi was the first to propose that only the second and third voyages were true as they are corroborated in Vespuccis other manuscript letters while the first and fourth voyages which are only found in the Soderini text were fabricated by the publishers</span>
				<span class='text'>The later 1937 discovery of a corrobotary Vespucci manuscript letter for the first voyage – the Ridolfi fragment Formisiano 1992 p</span>
				<span class='text'>7 44 – means only the fourth voyage is really found in Soderini alone</span>
				<span class='text'>The Magnaghi thesis has been a bitterly divisive factor in Vespucci scholarship</span>
				<span class='text'> The Magnaghi thesis was accepted and popularized by Pohl 1944 but rejected by Arciniegas 1955 who posited all four voyages as truthful</span>
				<span class='text'> Formisiano 1992 also rejects the Magnaghi thesis although recognizing publishers probably fiddled with it and declares all four voyages genuine but in details esp</span>
				<span class='text'>the first differing from Arciniegas</span>
				<span class='text'> Fernández Armesto 2007 p</span>
				<span class='text'>28 declares the authenticity question inconclusive hypothesizes that the first voyage is probably just another version of the second the third is unassailable and the fourth probably true but too mangled to be sure</span>
