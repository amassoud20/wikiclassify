				<span class='text'>ng}}'''Amerigo Vespucci''' ({{IPA-it|ameˈriːɡo vesˈputtʃi}}; March 9, 1454{{spaced ndash}}February 22, 1512) was an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[explorer]], [[financier]], [[navigator]] and [[cartographer]] who first demonstrated that [[Brazil]] and the [[West Indies]] did not represent Asia's eastern outskirts as initially conjectured from [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|Columbus' voyages]], but instead constituted an entirely separate landmass hitherto unknown to [[Afro-Eurasia]]ns</span>
				<span class='text'>Colloquially referred to as the [[New World]], this second super continent came to be termed &quot;[[Americas|America]]&quot;, deriving [[America (name)|its name]] from '''Americus''', the [[Latinisation of names|Latin]] version of Vespucci's [[given name|first name]]</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|left|thumb|The birthplace of Amerigo Vespucci</span>
				<span class='text'>]Amerigo Vespucci was born and raised in [[Republic of Florence|Florence]], [[Italian Peninsula|Italy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was the third son of Ser Nastagio (Anastasio), a Florentine notary, and Lisabetta Mini</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = markham&gt;C</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Markham (1894) &quot;Introduction&quot;, in ''The Letters of Amerigo Vespucci and other documents illustrative of his career''</span>
				<span class='text'> London: Hakluyt</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Amerigo Vespucci was educated by his uncle, Fra Giorgio Antonio Vespucci, a [[Dominican Order|Dominican friar]] of [[San Marco, Florence|the monastery of San Marco]] in Florence</span>
				<span class='text'>hile his elder brothers were sent to the [[University of Pisa]] to pursue scholarly careers, Amerigo Vespucci embraced a mercantile life, and was hired as a clerk by the Florentine commercial [[Medici bank|house of Medici]], headed by [[Lorenzo de' Medici]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Vespucci acquired the favor and protection of [[Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici]] who became the head of the business after the elder Lorenzo's death in 1492</span>
				<span class='text'> In March 1492, the Medici dispatched the thirty-eight-year-old Vespucci and Donato Niccolini as confidential agents to look into the Medici branch office in [[Cádiz]] (Spain), whose managers and dealings were under suspicion</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = markham/&gt;  In April 1495, by the intrigues of Bishop [[Juan Rodríguez de Fonseca]], the [[Crown of Castile]] broke their monopoly deal with [[Christopher Columbus]] and began handing out licenses to other navigators for the [[West Indies]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Just around this time (1495–96), Vespucci was engaged as the executor of Giannotto Berardi, an Italian merchant who had recently died in Seville</span>
				<span class='text'>Vespucci organized the fulfillment of Berardi's outstanding contract with the Castilian crown to provide twelve vessels for the Indies</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = markham/&gt;  After these were delivered, Vespucci continued as a provision contractor for Indies expeditions, and is known to have secured beef supplies for at least one (if not two) of Columbus' voyages</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = markham/&gt;==Expeditions==At the invitation of king [[Manuel I of Portugal]], Vespucci participated as observer in several voyages that explored the east coast of [[South America]] between 1499 and 1502</span>
				<span class='text'>On the first of these voyages he was aboard the ship that discovered that South America extended much further south than previously thought</span>
				<span class='text'>he expeditions became widely known in Europe after two accounts attributed to Vespucci were published between 1502 and 1504</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1507, [[Martin Waldseemüller]] produced a world map on which he named the new continent [[Americas|America]] after the feminine Latin version of Vespucci's first name, which is Americus</span>
				<span class='text'>In an accompanying book, Waldseemüller published one of the Vespucci accounts, which led to criticism that Vespucci was trying to upset [[Christopher Columbus]]' glory</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the rediscovery in the 18th century of other letters by Vespucci has led to the view that the early published accounts, notably the [[The Americas#Etymology and naming|Soderini Letter]], could be fabrications, not by Vespucci, but by others</span>
				<span class='text'>=Historical role==In 1508 the position of chief of navigation of Spain (''piloto mayor de Indias'') was created for Vespucci, with the responsibility of planning navigation for voyages to the Indies</span>

				<span class='text'>592)]]Two letters attributed to Vespucci were published during his lifetime</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[Mundus Novus]]'' (New World) was a Latin translation of a lost Italian letter sent from [[Lisbon]] to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici</span>
				<span class='text'>It describes a voyage to South America in 1501–1502</span>
				<span class='text'>''Mundus Novus'' was published in late 1502 or early 1503 and soon reprinted and distributed in numerous European countries</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;''Lettera di Amerigo Vespucci delle isole nuovamente trovate in quattro suoi viaggi'' (Letter of Amerigo Vespucci concerning the isles newly discovered on his four voyages), known as ''Lettera al Soderini'' or just ''Lettera'', was a letter in Italian addressed to [[Piero Soderini]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Printed in 1504 or 1505, it claimed to be an account of four voyages to the Americas made by Vespucci between 1497 and 1504</span>
				<span class='text'>A Latin translation was published by the German [[Martin Waldseemüller]] in 1507 in ''[[Cosmographiae Introductio]]'', a book on [[cosmography]] and [[geography]], as ''Quattuor Americi Vespucij navigationes'' (Four Voyages of Amerigo Vespucci)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=formisano/&gt;On March 22, 1508, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|King Ferdinand]] made Vespucci chief navigator of Spain at a huge salary&lt;ref&gt;Ober, p</span>
				<span class='text'>234&lt;/ref&gt; and commissioned him to found a school of navigation, in order to standardize and modernize navigation techniques used by Iberian sea captains then exploring the world</span>
				<span class='text'>Vespucci even developed a rudimentary, but fairly accurate method of determining longitude (which only more accurate chronometers would later improve upon)</span>

				<span class='text'>Engraving by Johann Froschauer for an edition of Amerigo Vespucci's ''Mundus Novus'', published in Augsburg in 1505</span>
				<span class='text'>]In the 18th century three unpublished familiar letters from Vespucci to Lorenzo de' Medici were rediscovered</span>
				<span class='text'>One describes a voyage made in 1499–1500 which corresponds with the second of the &quot;four voyages&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Another was written from [[Cap-Vert|Cape Verde]] in 1501 in the early part of the third of the four voyages, before crossing the Atlantic</span>
				<span class='text'>The third letter was sent from Lisbon after the completion of that voyage</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=formisano/&gt;Some have suggested that Vespucci, in the two letters published in his lifetime, was exaggerating his role and constructed deliberate fabrications</span>
				<span class='text'>However, many scholars now believe that the two letters were not written by him but were fabrications by others based in part on genuine letters by Vespucci</span>
				<span class='text'>t was the publication and widespread circulation of the letters that might have led Waldseemüller to name the new continent [[Americas|America]] on his world map of 1507 in [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Vespucci used a [[Latinization (literature)|Latinised]] form of his name, '''Americus Vespucius''', in his [[Latin]] writings, which Waldseemüller used as a base for the new name, taking the feminine form ''America'', according to the prevalent view (for other hypotheses, see the footnote in the introduction)</span>
				<span class='text'>The book accompanying the map stated: &quot;I do not see what right any one would have to object to calling this part, after Americus who discovered it and who is a man of intelligence, Amerige, that is, the Land of Americus, or America: since both Europa and Asia got their names from women&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'> It is possible that Vespucci was not aware that Waldseemüller had named the continent after him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ray, p</span>
				<span class='text'>3&lt;/ref&gt;The two disputed letters claim that Vespucci made four voyages to America, while at most two can be verified from other sources</span>
				<span class='text'>At the moment there is a dispute between historians on when Vespucci visited the mainland the first time</span>
				<span class='text'>Some historians like Germán Arciniegas and Gabriel Camargo Pérez think that his first voyage was made in June 1497 with the Spanish Pilot Juan de la Cosa</span>
				<span class='text'>espucci's real historical importance may well rest more in his letters, whether he wrote them all or not, than in his discoveries</span>
				<span class='text'>From these letters, the European public learned about the newly discovered continents of the Americas for the first time; its existence became generally known throughout Europe within a few years of the letters' publication</span>

				<span class='text'>==Second voyage===About 1499–1500, Vespucci joined an expedition in the service of Spain, with [[Alonso de Ojeda]] (or Hojeda) as the fleet commander</span>
				<span class='text'>The intention was to sail around the southern end of the African mainland into the [[Indian Ocean]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=OGorman&gt;{{cite book | last = O'Gorman | first = Edmundo | authorlink = Edmundo O'Gorman | title = The Invention of America | publisher = Indiana University Press | year = 1961 | pages = 106–107}}&lt;/ref&gt; After hitting land at the coast of what is now [[Guyana]], the two seem to have separated</span>
				<span class='text'>Vespucci sailed southward, discovering the mouth of the [[Amazon River]] and reaching 6°S, before turning around and seeing [[Trinidad]] and the [[Orinoco River]] and returning to Spain by way of [[Hispaniola]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The letter, to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici, claims that Vespucci determined his longitude celestially&lt;ref name=Vcelest&gt;   on a rainy and stormy day with calm seas, stars could be identified   near the horizon to judge [[latitude]]/[[longitude]]   celestially</span>
				<span class='text'>Although South America's [[continental shelf]]   drops quickly into the deep ocean beyond the [[Orinoco River]],   the mouth is on the shelf, avoiding the ocean swells   and waves which hinder visibility of stars near the   horizon</span>
				<span class='text'> Seamen who could navigate from Europe to America   and back could chart stars on the horizon, especially   for a [[cartographer]] like Vespucci</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;on August 23, 1499, while on this voyage</span>
				<span class='text'>However, that claim may be fraudulent,&lt;ref name=Vcelest/&gt; which could cast doubt on the letter's credibility</span>
				<span class='text'>==Third voyage===[[File:Amerigo Vespucci (with turban)</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Portrait of Vespucci which titles him &quot;discoverer and conqueror of Brazilian land&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>]The last certain voyage of Vespucci was led by [[Gonçalo Coelho]] in 1501–1502 in the service of [[Portugal]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Departing from [[Lisbon]], the fleet sailed first to [[Cap-Vert|Cape Verde]] where they met two of [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]]'s ships returning from [[India]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In a letter from Cape Verde, Vespucci says that he hopes to visit the same lands that Álvares Cabral had explored, suggesting that the intention is to sail west to Asia, as on the 1499–1500 voyage</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=OGorman/&gt; On reaching the coast of [[Brazil]], they sailed south along the coast of [[South America]] to [[Rio de Janeiro]]'s bay</span>
				<span class='text'>If his own account is to be believed, he reached the latitude of [[Patagonia]] before turning back, although this also seems doubtful, since his account does not mention the broad estuary of the [[Río de la Plata]], which he must have seen if he had gotten that far south</span>
				<span class='text'>Portuguese maps of South America, created after the voyage of Coelho and Vespucci, do not show any land south of present-day [[Cananéia]] at 25° S, so this may represent the southernmost extent of their voyages</span>
				<span class='text'>fter the first half of the expedition, Vespucci mapped [[Alpha Centauri|Alpha]] and [[Beta Centauri]], as well as the [[constellation]] [[Crux]], the Southern Cross and the Coalsack Nebula</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Although these [[star]]s had been known to the ancient [[Greece|Greeks]], gradual [[precession (astronomy)|precession]] had lowered them below the [[Europe]]an horizon so that they had been forgotten</span>
				<span class='text'>On his return to Lisbon, Vespucci wrote in a letter to Medici that the land masses they explored were much larger than anticipated and different from the Asia described by [[Ptolemy]] or [[Marco Polo]] and therefore, must be a New World, that is, a previously unknown fourth continent, after Europe, Asia, and Africa</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}===Fourth voyage===Vespucci's fourth voyage was another expedition for the Portuguese crown down the eastern coast of Brazil, that set out in May 1503 and returned to Portugal in June 1504</span>
				<span class='text'>Like his alleged first voyage, Vespucci's last voyage in 1503–1504 is also disputed to have taken place</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ray, p</span>
				<span class='text'>1&lt;/ref&gt;  The only source of information for the last voyage is the ''Letter to Soderini'',&lt;ref&gt;Markham, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>2–56&lt;/ref&gt; but as several modern scholars dispute Vespucci's authorship of the letter to Soderini, it is also sometimes doubted whether Vespucci undertook this trip</span>
				<span class='text'>{ref label|5th|b|b}}  However, Portuguese documents do confirm a voyage to Brazil was undertaken in 1503–04 by the captain [[Gonçalo Coelho]], very likely the same captain of the 1501 mapping expedition (Vespucci's third voyage), and so it is quite possible that Vespucci went on board this one as well</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Fernández-Armesto (2007: p</span>
				<span class='text'>68-69)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  However, it is not independently confirmed Vespucci was aboard and there are some difficulties in the reported dates and details</span>
				<span class='text'>he letters caused controversy after Vespucci's death, especially among the supporters of Columbus who believed Columbus' priority for the discovery of America was being undermined, and seriously damaged Vespucci's reputation</span>

				<span class='text'> Once [[cosmographer]]s realized that the [[New World]] was not connected to the [[Old World|Old]] (but before its true [[geography]] was fully [[map]]ped), they considered the [[Americas]] to be a single, fourth [[continent]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{{note label|5th|b|b}} The question of the authenticity of Vespucci's authorship of the 1504 ''Mundus Novus'' and the 1505 ''Letter of Soderini'', the only two texts published in Vespucci's lifetime, was famously raised by Magnaghi (1924)</span>
				<span class='text'>He proposed the Soderini letter was ''not'' written by Vespucci, but rather cobbled together by unscrupulous Florentine publishers, cutting and pasting together various accounts, some from Vespucci, others from elsewhere</span>
				<span class='text'>Magnaghi was the first to propose that only the second and third voyages were true (as they are corroborated in Vespucci's other manuscript letters), while the first and fourth voyages (which are only found in the Soderini text) were fabricated by the publishers</span>
				<span class='text'>The later (1937) discovery of a corrobotary Vespucci manuscript letter for the first voyage – the &quot;Ridolfi fragment&quot; (Formisiano, 1992: p</span>
				<span class='text'>7-44) – means only the fourth voyage is really found in Soderini alone</span>
				<span class='text'>The Magnaghi thesis has been a bitterly divisive factor in Vespucci scholarship</span>
				<span class='text'> The Magnaghi thesis was accepted and popularized by Pohl (1944) but rejected by Arciniegas (1955), who posited all four voyages as truthful</span>
				<span class='text'> Formisiano (1992) also rejects the Magnaghi thesis (although recognizing publishers probably fiddled with it), and declares all four voyages genuine, but in details (esp</span>
				<span class='text'>the first) differing from Arciniegas</span>
				<span class='text'> Fernández-Armesto (2007: p</span>
				<span class='text'>28) declares the authenticity question &quot;inconclusive&quot;, hypothesizes that the first voyage is probably just another version of the second, the third is unassailable, and the fourth probably true (but too mangled to be sure)</span>
