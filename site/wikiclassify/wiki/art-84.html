				<span class='text'>Hence Babur though nominally a Mongol or Moghul in Persian language drew much of his support from the local Turkic and Iranian people of Central Asia and his army was diverse in its ethnic makeup</span>
				<span class='text'>It included  known to Babur as s and    as well as Barlas and Chaghatayid Turko Mongols from Central Asia</span>
				<span class='text'> Rule in Central Asia In 1494 at eleven years old Babur became the ruler of Fergana in present day Uzbekistan after Umar Sheikh Mirza died while tending pigeons in an ill constructed dovecote that toppled into the ravine below the palace</span>
				<span class='text'> During this time two of his uncles from the neighbouring kingdoms who were hostile to his father and a group of nobles who wanted his younger brother Jahangir to be the ruler threatened his succession to the throne</span>
				<span class='text'>His uncles were relentless in their attempts to dislodge him from this position as well as from many of his other territorial possessions to come</span>
				<span class='text'> Babur was able to secure his throne mainly because of help from his maternal grandmother Aisan Daulat Begum although there was also some luck involved</span>
				<span class='text'>ost territories around his kingdom were ruled by his relatives who were descendants of either Timur or Genghis Khan and were constantly in conflict</span>
				<span class='text'>At that time rival princes were fighting over the city of Samarkand to the west which was ruled by his paternal cousin</span>
				<span class='text'>Babur had a great ambition to capture it and in 1497 he  for seven months before eventually gaining control over it</span>
				<span class='text'>name Afghanistan  He was fifteen years old and for him this campaign was a huge achievement</span>
				<span class='text'>Babur was able to hold it despite desertions in his army but later fell seriously ill</span>
				<span class='text'>Meanwhile a rebellion amongst nobles who favoured his brother back home approximately  away robbed him of Fergana</span>
				<span class='text'>name Afghanistan   As he was marching to recover it he lost the Samarkand to a rival prince leaving him with neither Fergana nor Samarkand</span>
				<span class='text'>He had held Samarkand for 100 days and he considered this defeat as his biggest loss obsessing over it even later in his life after his conquests in India</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1501 he laid  once more but was soon defeated by his most formidable rival   of the Uzbeks</span>
				<span class='text'>name Afghanistan    Samarkand his lifelong obsession was lost again</span>
				<span class='text'>He tried to reclaim Fergana but lost it too and escaping with a small band of followers he wandered to the mountains of central Asia and took uge with hill tribes</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus during the ten years since becoming the ruler of Fergana Babur suffered many short lived victories and was without shelter and in exile aided by friends and peasants</span>
				<span class='text'>He finally stayed in  which was ruled by his maternal uncle</span>
				<span class='text'>Babur wrote During my stay in Tashkent I endured much poverty and humiliation</span>
				<span class='text'>No country or hope of one For three years Babur concentrated on building up a strong army recruiting widely amongst the Tajiks of  in particular</span>
				<span class='text'>By 1502 Babur had resigned all hopes of recovering Fergana he was left with nothing and was forced to try his luck someplace else</span>

				<span class='text'>The city was then claimed by Mukin Begh who was considered to be a usurper and was opposed by the local populace</span>

				<span class='text'>With this move he gained a new kingdom re established his fortunes and would remain its ruler until 1526</span>
				<span class='text'>name VDM0   In 1505 because of the low revenue generated by his new mountain kingdom Babur began his first expedition to India in his memoirs he wrote My desire for Hindustan had been constant</span>

				<span class='text'>It was a brief raid across the </span>
				<span class='text'>n the same year Babur united with  of  a fellow Timurid and distant relative against their common enemy the Uzbek Shaybani</span>
				<span class='text'>name perspect  However this venture did not take place because Husayn Mirza died in 1506 and his two sons were reluctant to go to war</span>
				<span class='text'>Babur instead stayed at Herat after being invited by the two Mirza brothers</span>
				<span class='text'>It was then the cultural capital of the eastern Muslim world</span>
				<span class='text'>Though he was disgusted by the vices and luxuries of the city he marvelled at the intellectual abundance there which he stated was filled with learned and matched men</span>
				<span class='text'> He became acquainted with the work of the Chagatai poet  who encouraged the use of Chagatai as a </span>
				<span class='text'>Navais proficiency with the language which he is credited with founding  may have influenced Babur in his decision to use it for his memoirs</span>
				<span class='text'>He spent two months there before being forced to leave because of diminishing resources name perspect   it later was overrun by Shaybani and the Mirzas fled</span>
				<span class='text'>abur became the only reigning ruler of the Timurid dynasty after the loss of Herat and many princes sought uge from him at Kabul because of Shaybanis invasion in the west</span>
				<span class='text'>He thus assumed the title of  emperor among the Timurids—though this tile was insignificant since most of his ancestral lands were taken Kabul itself was in danger and Shaybani continued to be a threat</span>
				<span class='text'>He prevailed during a potential rebellion in Kabul but two years later a revolt among some of his leading generals drove him out of Kabul</span>
				<span class='text'>Escaping with very few companions Babur soon returned to the city capturing Kabul again and regaining the allegiance of the rebels</span>
				<span class='text'>Meanwhile Shaybani was defeated and killed by  Shah of  Safavid Persia in 1510</span>
				<span class='text'>Babur and the remaining Timurids used this opportunity to reconquer their ancestral territories</span>
				<span class='text'>Over the following few years Babur and Shah Ismail formed a partnership in an attempt to take over parts of Central Asia</span>
				<span class='text'>In return for Ismails assistance Babur permitted the Safavids to act as a suzerain over him and his followers</span>
				<span class='text'> Thus in 1513 after leaving his brother Nasir Mirza to rule Kabul he managed to get Samarkand for the third time and Bokhara but lost both again to the Uzbeks</span>
				<span class='text'>name VDM0   Shah Ismail reunited Babur with his sister  who had been imprisoned by and forced to marry the recently deceased Shaybani</span>

				<span class='text'>The Safavids army led by  massacred civilians in  and then sought the assistance of Babur who advised the Safavids to withdraw</span>
				<span class='text'>The Safavids however used and were defeated during the  by the warlord Ubaydullah Khan</span>
				<span class='text'>Baburs early relations with theOttomans were poor because the Ottoman   provided his rival Ubaydullah Khan with powerful s and s</span>

				<span class='text'> From them he also adopted the tactic of using matchlocks and cannons in field rather than only in s which would give him an important advantage in India</span>
				<span class='text'>Formation of the Mughal Empire Babur still wanted to escape from the Uzbeks and finally chose India as a uge instead of Badakhshan which was to the north of Kabul</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote In the presence of such power and potency we had to think of some place for ourselves and at this crisis and in the crack of time there was put a wider space between us and the strong foeman</span>
				<span class='text'>After his third loss of Samarkand Babur gave full attention on conquest of India launching a campaign he reached  now in  in 1519</span>
