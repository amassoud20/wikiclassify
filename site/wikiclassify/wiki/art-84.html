				<span class='text'>His origin, milieu, training, and education were steeped in Persian culture and so Bābor was largely responsible for the fostering of this culture by his descendants, the Mughals of India, and for the expansion of Persian cultural influence in the Indian subcontinent, with brilliant literary, artistic, and historiographical results</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Though born as Zahiruddin Muhammad Babur, he was commonly known as Babur</span>
				<span class='text'>He was the eldest son of [[Umar Sheikh Mirza]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He ascended the throne of [[Fergana]] in 1495 at the age of twelve and faced rebellion from his own relatives</span>
				<span class='text'>He conquered [[Samarkand]] two years later, only to lose the city of Fergana soon after</span>
				<span class='text'>In his attempt to reconquer it, he lost control of Samarkand</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1501, his attempt to recapture both cities went in vain as he was defeated by [[Muhammad Shaybani Khan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1504, he conquered [[Kabul]], which was under the rule of the infant heir of [[Ulugh Begh]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Babur formed a partnership with [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] ruler [[Ismail I]] and reconquered parts of central Asia including Samarkand, only to lose Samarkand and the other newly-conquered lands again to the Uzbeks</span>
				<span class='text'>fter losing Samarkand for the third time, Babur turned his attention to creating his empire in [[north India]]</span>
				<span class='text'>At that time, [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]] of northern Indian Subcontinent was ruled by [[Ibrahim Lodi]] of the Afghan [[Lodi dynasty]], whereas [[Rajputana]] was ruled by a Hindu [[Rajput|Rajput Confederacy]], lead by [[Rana Sanga]] of [[Mewar]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1524, [[Daulat Khan Lodi]], a rebel of the Lodhi dynasty, invited Babur, to overthrow Ibrahim and become ruler</span>
				<span class='text'>Babur defeated Ibrahim Lodi at the [[First Battle of Panipat]] in 1526 and so founded the Mughal empire</span>
				<span class='text'>However, he again had to face opposition, this time from [[Rana Sanga]] of [[Mewar]] who considered Babur as a foreigner</span>
				<span class='text'>The Rana was defeated at the [[Battle of Khanwa]]</span>
				<span class='text'>abur married several times</span>
				<span class='text'>Notable among his sons are [[Humayun]], [[Kamran Mirza]] and [[Hindal Mirza]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He died in 1530 and was succeeded by Humayun</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Babur's wishes, he was buried in [[Gardens of Babur|Bagh-e-Babur]] at Kabul in [[Afghanistan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Being a patrilineal descendant of Timur, Babur considered himself as a Timurid and Turk, though Uzbek sources claim him as an ethnic Uzbek</span>
				<span class='text'>He is considered a national hero in [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of his poems also have become popular folk songs</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote his autobiography, ''[[Baburnama]]'', in [[Chaghatai language|Chaghatai Turkic]] and this was later translated to [[Persian language|Persian]] during [[Akbar]]'s reign</span>
