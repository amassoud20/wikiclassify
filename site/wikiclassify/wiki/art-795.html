				<span class='text'>Known in Spain as &quot;Felipe el Prudente&quot; ('&quot;Philip the Prudent'&quot;), his [[Spanish Empire|empire]] included territories on every continent then known to Europeans, including his namesake [[Philippines|the Philippine Islands]]</span>
				<span class='text'>During his reign, Spain reached the height of its influence and power</span>
				<span class='text'>This is sometimes called the ''[[Spanish Golden Age|Golden Age]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The expression, &quot;the empire on which the sun never sets,&quot; was coined during Philip's time to reflect the extent of his dominion</span>
				<span class='text'>uring Philip's reign there were separate [[sovereign default|state bankruptcies]] in 1557, 1560, 1569, 1575, and 1596</span>
				<span class='text'>This was partly the cause for the [[Act of Abjuration|declaration of independence]] which created the [[Dutch Republic]] in 1581</span>
				<span class='text'>A devout Catholic, Philip is also known for organising a huge naval expedition against Protestant England in 1588, known usually as the [[Spanish Armada]], which was unsuccessful, mostly due to storms and grave logistical problems</span>
				<span class='text'>hilip was described by the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] ambassador Paolo Fagolo in 1563 as &quot;slight of stature and round-faced, with pale blue eyes, [[Habsburg lip|somewhat prominent lip]], and pink skin, but his overall appearance is very attractive</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The Ambassador went on to say &quot;He dresses very tastefully, and everything that he does is courteous and gracious</span>

				<span class='text'>The culture and courtly life of Spain were an important influence in his early life</span>
				<span class='text'>He was tutored by Juan Martínez Siliceo – the future [[Archbishop of Toledo]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip displayed reasonable aptitude in arms and letters alike</span>
				<span class='text'>Later he would study with more illustrious tutors, including the humanist Juan Cristóbal Calvete de Estrella</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip, though he had good command over [[Latin]], Spanish and Portuguese, never managed to equal his father, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], as a polyglot</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite being also a German [[archduke]] from the [[House of Habsburg]], Philip was seen as a foreigner in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The feeling was mutual</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip felt himself to be culturally Spanish; he had been born in Spain and raised in the Castilian court, his native tongue was Spanish, and he preferred to live in Spain</span>
				<span class='text'>This would ultimately impede his succession to the imperial throne</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;JBE&quot;&gt;James Boyden; Europe, 1450 to 1789: Encyclopaedia of the Early Modern World</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In April 1528, when Philip was eleven months old, he received the oath of allegiance as heir to the crown from the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], and from that time until the death of his mother [[Isabella of Portugal|Isabella]] in 1539, Philip was raised in the royal court of Castile under the care of his mother, and one of her [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] ladies, Dona Leonor de Mascarenhas, to whom he was devotedly attached</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip was also close to his two sisters, [[Maria of Austria, Holy Roman Empress|María]] and [[Joan of Austria, Princess of Portugal|Juana]], and to his two pages, the Portuguese nobleman [[Ruy Gómez de Silva|Rui Gomes da Silva]] and [[Luis de Requesens]], the son of his governor Juan de Zúñiga</span>
				<span class='text'>These men would serve Philip throughout their lives, as would Antonio Pérez, his secretary from 1541</span>
				<span class='text'>hilip's martial training was undertaken by his governor, Juan de Zúñiga, a Castilian nobleman who served as the [[commendador]] mayor of Castile</span>
				<span class='text'>The practical lessons in warfare was overseen by the [[Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Duke of Alba]] during the [[Italian War of 1542–1546|Italian Wars]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip was present at the [[Siege of Perpignan (1542)|Siege of Perpignan]] in 1542, but did not see action as the Spanish army under Alba decisively defeated the besieging French forces under the [[Henry II of France|Dauphin of France]]</span>
				<span class='text'>On his way back to Castile, Philip received the oath of allegiance of the [[Aragon]]ese Cortes at [[Monzón]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His political training had begun a year previously under his father, who had found his son studious, grave, and prudent beyond his years, and having decided to train and initiate him in the government of Spain</span>
				<span class='text'>The king-emperor's interactions with his son during his stay in Spain convinced him of Philip's precocity in statesmanship, and so he determined to leave in his hands the [[List of Spanish regents|regency of Spain]] in 1543</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip, who had previously been made the [[Duke of Milan]] in 1540, began governing the most extensive empire in the world at the young age of sixteen</span>
				<span class='text'>harles left Philip with experienced advisors—notably the secretary [[Francisco de los Cobos]] and the general Duke of Alba</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip was also left with extensive written instructions which emphasised &quot;piety, patience, modesty, and distrust</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; These principles of Charles were gradually assimilated by his son, who would grow up to become grave, self-possessed and cautious</span>
				<span class='text'>Personally, Philip spoke softly, and had an icy self-mastery; in the words of one of his ministers, &quot;he had a smile that cut like a sword</span>

				<span class='text'>1</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Philip II decided to return to Spain</span>
				<span class='text'>Although sometimes described as an absolute monarch, Philip faced many constitutional constraints on his authority</span>
				<span class='text'>This was largely influenced by the growing strength of the bureaucracy during Philip's reign</span>
				<span class='text'>he [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] Empire was not a single monarchy with one legal system but a federation of separate realms, each jealously guarding its own rights against those of the [[House of Habsburg]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In practice, Philip often found his authority over-ruled by local assemblies, and his word less effective than that of local lords</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Parker, ''The Dutch Revolt''</span>
				<span class='text'>p</span>
				<span class='text'>2</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Philip carried [[List of titles and honours of the Heir Apparent to the Spanish Throne#Titles held by the heir apparent to the Spanish Throne|several titles]] including [[Prince of Asturias]] as [[List of heirs to the Spanish throne|heir to the Spanish kingdoms and empire]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The newest constituent kingdom in the empire was [[Kingdom of Navarre#Spanish conquest of Navarre|Navarre]], a realm invaded by [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] mainly with Castilian troops (1512), and annexed to Castile with an ambiguous status (1513)</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Spanish conquest of Iberian Navarre|War across Navarre]] continued until 1528 ([[Treaty of Madrid (1526)#Madrid|Treaties of Madrid and Cambrai]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Charles V proposed to end hostilities with King [[Henry II of Navarre]]—the legitimate monarch of Navarre—by marrying his son Philip to the heiress of Navarre, [[Jeanne III of Navarre]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The marriage would provide a dynastic solution to instability in Navarre, it would make him king of all Navarre and prince of independent [[Béarn]], as well as lord of a large part of southern France</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the French nobility under [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] opposed the arrangement, and successfully ended the prospects of marriage between the heirs of Habsburg and Albret in 1541</span>
				<span class='text'>n his will Charles stated his doubts over Navarre and recommended his son to give the kingdom back</span>
				<span class='text'>Both King Charles and his son Philip II failed to abide by the elective (contractual) nature of the Crown of Navarre, and took the kingdom for granted</span>
				<span class='text'>This sparked mounting tension not only with King [[Henry II of Navarre]] and Queen [[Jeanne III of Navarre]], but with the Parliament of the Spanish Navarre (''Cortes'', ''The Three States'') and the ''Diputación'' for breach of the [[Fueros of Navarre|realm specific laws (fueros)]]—violation of the ''pactum subjectionis'' as ratified by Ferdinand</span>
				<span class='text'>Tensions in Navarre came to a head in 1592 after several years of disagreements over the agenda of the intended parliamentary session</span>
				<span class='text'>n November 1592, the Parliament (''Cortes'') of Aragón revolted against another breach of the realm specific laws, so the Attorney General (''Justicia'') of the kingdom Juan de Lanuza was executed on Philip II's orders, with his secretary [[Antonio Perez]] taking to exile in France</span>
				<span class='text'>In Navarre the major strongholds of the kingdom were garrisoned by troops alien to the kingdom (Castilians) in conspicuous violation of the laws of Navarre, and the Parliament had long been refusing to pledge loyalty to Philip II's son and heir apparent without a proper ceremony</span>
				<span class='text'>On 20 November 1592 a ghostly Parliament session was called pushed by Philip II, who had arrived in [[Pamplona#Three boroughs and one city|Pamplona]] at the head of an unspecified military force, and one only point on his agenda—attendance to the session was kept blank on the minutes: unlawful appointments of trusted Castilian officials and an imposition of his son as future king of Navarre at the Santa Maria Cathedral</span>
				<span class='text'>A ceremony was held before the bishop of Pamplona (22 November), but its customary procedure and terms were altered</span>
				<span class='text'>Protests erupted in Pamplona, but they were quelled</span>
				<span class='text'>hilip II also grappled with the problem of the large [[Morisco]] population in Spain, who were sometimes forcibly converted to Christianity by his predecessors</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1569, the [[Morisco Revolt]] broke out in the southern province of [[Granada (province)|Granada]] in defiance of attempts to suppress Moorish customs; and Philip ordered the expulsion of the Moriscos from Granada and their dispersal to other provinces</span>
				<span class='text'>espite its immense dominions, Spain was a country with a sparse population that yielded a limited income to the crown (in contrast to France, for example, which was much more heavily populated)</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip faced major difficulties in raising taxes, the collection of which was largely farmed out to local lords</span>
				<span class='text'>He was able to finance his military campaigns only by taxing and exploiting the local resources of his empire</span>
				<span class='text'>The flow of income from the [[New World]] proved vital to his militant foreign policy, but nonetheless his exchequer several times faced bankruptcy</span>
				<span class='text'>hilip's reign saw a flourishing of cultural excellence in Spain, the beginning of what is called the [[Spanish Golden Age|''Golden Age'']], creating a lasting legacy in literature, music, and the visual arts</span>

				<span class='text'>In this way, the prince's pale complexion appears more distinguished</span>
				<span class='text'>]Charles V had left Philip with a debt of about 36 million [[ducat]]s and an annual deficit of 1 million ducats</span>
				<span class='text'>This debt caused Phillip II to default on loans in 1557, 1560, 1575, and 1596 (including debt to Poland, known as [[Neapolitan sums]])</span>
				<span class='text'>This happened because the lenders had no power over the king and could not force him to repay his loans</span>
				<span class='text'>These defaults were just the beginning of Spain's economic troubles as Spain's kings would default six more times in the next 65 years</span>

				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from reducing state revenues for overseas expeditions, the domestic policies of Philip II further burdened Spain, and would, in the following century, contribute to its decline, as maintained by some historians</span>

				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt;Spain was subject to different assemblies: the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] in [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] along with the assembly in [[Navarre]] and one each for the three regions of [[Aragon]], which preserved traditional rights and laws from the time when they were separate kingdoms</span>
				<span class='text'>This made Spain and its possessions difficult to rule, unlike France which, while divided into regional states, had a single [[French States-General|Estates-General]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The lack of a viable supreme assembly led to power defaulting into Philip's hands, especially as manager and final arbiter of the constant conflict between different authorities</span>
				<span class='text'>To deal with the difficulties arising from this situation, authority was administered by local agents appointed by the crown and viceroys carrying out crown instructions</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip felt it necessary to be involved in the detail and presided over specialised councils for state affairs, finance, war, and the [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]]</span>
				<span class='text'>e played groups against each other, leading to a system of checks and balances that managed affairs inefficiently, even to the extent of damaging state business, as in the [[Antonio Perez|Perez affair]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Following a fire in [[Valladolid]] in 1561, he resisted calls to move his Court to [[Lisbon]], an act that could have curbed centralisation and bureaucracy domestically as well as relaxed rule in the Empire</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, with the traditional Royal and [[Primate of Spain|Primacy]] seat of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] now essentially obsolete, Philip moved his Court to the Castilian stronghold of [[Madrid]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Except for a brief period under [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]], Madrid has remained the capital of Spain to the present day</span>
				<span class='text'>hereas his father had been forced to an itinerant rule as a medieval king, Philip ruled at a critical turning point in European history toward [[modernity]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He mainly directed state affairs, even when not at Court</span>
				<span class='text'>Indeed, when his health began failing, he worked from his quarters in the Palace-Monastery-Pantheon of [[El Escorial]] he had built</span>
				<span class='text'>But Philip did not enjoy the supremacy that [[Louis XIV of France]] would in the next century, nor was such a rule necessarily possible at his time</span>
				<span class='text'>The inefficiencies of the Spanish state and restrictively regulated industry under his rule were common to many contemporary countries</span>
				<span class='text'>Further, the dispersal of the Moriscos from [[Granada]] – motivated by the fear they might support a Muslim invasion – had serious negative economic effects, particularly in that region</span>
				<span class='text'>=Foreign policy==Philip's foreign policies were determined by a combination of Catholic fervour and dynastic objectives</span>
				<span class='text'>He considered himself the chief defender of Catholic Europe, both against the [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman Turks]] and against the forces of the [[Protestant Reformation]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He never relented from his fight against [[heresy]], defending the Catholic faith and limiting freedom of worship within his territories</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;As Philip wrote in 1566 to [[Luis de Zúñiga y Requesens|Luis de Requesens]]: &quot;You can assure his Holiness that rather than suffer the least injury to religion and the service of God, I would lose all my states and a hundred lives if I had them, for I do not intend to rule over heretics</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; {{Harvnb|Pettegree|p=214}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; These territories included his patrimony in the Netherlands, where Protestantism had taken deep root</span>
				<span class='text'>Following the [[Revolt of the Netherlands]] in 1568, Philip waged a campaign against Dutch heresy and secession</span>
				<span class='text'>It also dragged in the English and the French at times and expanded into the German Rhineland with the [[Cologne War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This series of conflicts lasted for the rest of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip's constant involvement in European wars took a significant toll on the treasury and played a huge role in leading the Crown into economic difficulties and even bankruptcies</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1588, the English defeated Philip's [[Spanish Armada]], thwarting his planned invasion of the country to reinstate Catholicism</span>
				<span class='text'>But the war continued for the next sixteen years, in a complex series of struggles that included France, Ireland and the main battle zone, the [[Low Countries]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It would not end until all the leading protagonists, including himself, had died</span>
				<span class='text'>Earlier, however, after several setbacks in his reign and especially that of his father, Philip did achieve a decisive victory against the Turks at the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Lepanto]] in 1571, with the allied fleet of the [[Holy League (1571)|Holy League]], which he had put under the command of his illegitimate brother, [[John of Austria]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also successfully secured his succession to the throne of [[Iberian Union|Portugal]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ith regard to Philip's overseas possessions, in response to the reforms imposed by the Ordenanzas, extensive questionnaires were distributed to every major town and region in New Spain called [[relaciones geográficas]]</span>
				<span class='text'>These surveys helped the Spanish monarchy to more effectively govern these overseas conquests</span>
				<span class='text'>==Italy==={{Main|Italian Wars}}Charles V formally abdicated the throne of Naples to Philip on 25 July 1554, and the young king was invested with the kingdom (officially called &quot;Naples and Sicily&quot;) on 2 October by [[Pope Julius III]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The date of Charles' abdication of the throne of Sicily is uncertain, but Philip was invested with this kingdom (officially &quot;Sicily and Jerusalem&quot;) on 18 November 1554 by Julius</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[Fernand Braudel]], ''The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II'', vol</span>
				<span class='text'>2 (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1995), 935–36 and notes</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In 1556, Philip decided to declare war in the [[Papal States]] and temporarily gobbled up territory there, perhaps in response to [[Pope Paul IV]]'s anti-Spanish outlook</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Philip II, he was doing it for the benefit of the [[Catholic Church|Church]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n a letter from [[Francisco de Vargas y Mexia|Francisco de Vargas]] to the Princess Dowager of Portugal, Regent of Spain, dated 22 September 1556, it is written:{{quote|&quot;I have reported to your Highness what has been happening here, and how far the Pope is going in his fury and vain imaginings</span>
				<span class='text'>His Majesty could not do otherwise than have a care for his reputation and dominions</span>
				<span class='text'>I am sure your Highness will have had more recent news from the Duke of Alva, who has taken the field with an excellent army and has penetrated so far into the Pope's territory that his cavalry is raiding up to ten miles{{Clarify|post-text=(Italian miles?)|date=March 2014}} from Rome, where there is such panic that the population would have run away had not the gates been closed</span>
				<span class='text'>The Pope has fallen ill with rage, and was struggling with a fever on the 16th of this month</span>
				<span class='text'>The two Carafa brothers, the Cardinal and Count Montorio, do not agree, and they and Piero Strozzi are not on as good terms as they were in the past</span>
				<span class='text'>They would like to discuss peace</span>
				<span class='text'>The best thing would be for the Pope to die, for he is the poison at the root of all this trouble and more which may occur</span>
				<span class='text'>His Majesty's intention is only to wrest the knife from this madman's hand and make him return to a sense of his dignity, acting like the protector of the [[Holy See|Apostolic See]], in whose name, and that of the [[College of Cardinals]], his Majesty has publicly proclaimed that he has seized all he is occupying</span>

				<span class='text'>The Spanish army decisively defeated the French at [[Battle of St</span>

				<span class='text'>Quentin]] in 1557 and at [[Battle of Gravelines (1558)|Gravelines]] in 1558</span>
				<span class='text'>The resulting [[Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis]] in 1559 secured [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]], Savoy, and [[Corsica]] for the Spanish allied states, the [[Duchy of Savoy]], and the [[Republic of Genoa]]</span>
				<span class='text'>France recognised Spanish control over the [[Franche-Comté]], but, more importantly, the treaty also confirmed the direct control of Philip over [[Duchy of Milan|Milan]], [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], Sicily, [[Sardinia]], and the [[State of Presidi]], and indirectly (through his dominance of the rulers of [[Tuscany]], Genoa, and other minor states) of all Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>The Pope was a natural Spanish ally</span>
				<span class='text'>The only truly independent entities on Italian soil were the allied Duchy of Savoy and the [[Republic of Venice]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Spanish control of Italy would last until the early eighteenth century</span>
				<span class='text'>Ultimately, the treaty ended the 60-year, Franco-Spanish wars for supremacy in Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>y the end of the wars in 1559, [[Habsburg Spain]] had been established as the premier power of Europe, to the detriment of France</span>
				<span class='text'>In France, [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] was fatally wounded in a joust held during the celebrations of the peace</span>
				<span class='text'>His death led to the accession of his 15-year-old son [[Francis II of France|Francis II]], who in turn soon died</span>
				<span class='text'>The French monarchy was thrown into turmoil, which increased further with the outbreak of the [[French Wars of Religion]] that would last for several decades</span>
				<span class='text'>The states of Italy were reduced to second-rate powers and Milan and Naples were annexed directly to Spain</span>
				<span class='text'>Mary Tudor's death in 1558 enabled Philip to seal the treaty by marrying Henry II's daughter, [[Elisabeth of Valois]], later giving him a claim to the throne of France on behalf of his daughter by Elisabeth, [[Isabel Clara Eugenia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==France==={{main|French Wars of Religion}}The French Wars of Religion (1562–98) were primarily fought between French Catholics and Protestants (Huguenots)</span>
				<span class='text'>The conflict involved the factional disputes between the aristocratic houses of France, such as the House of Bourbon and House of Guise (Lorraine), and both sides received assistance from foreign sources</span>
				<span class='text'>hilip signed the [[Treaty of Vaucelles]] with Henry II of France in 1556</span>
				<span class='text'>Based on the terms of the treaty, the territory of the [[Franche-Comté]] was to be relinquished to Philip</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the treaty was broken shortly afterwards</span>
				<span class='text'>France and Spain waged war in northern France and Italy over the following years</span>
				<span class='text'>Spanish victory at St</span>
				<span class='text'>Quentin and Gravelines led to the Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis in which France recognised Spanish sovereignty over the Franche-Comté</span>
				<span class='text'>uring the [[War of the Portuguese Succession]], the pretender [[António, Prior of Crato|António]] fled to France following his defeats and, as Philip’s armies had not yet occupied the [[Azores]], he sailed there with a large Anglo-French fleet under [[Filippo di Piero Strozzi|Filippo Strozzi]], a [[Florence|Florentine]] exile in the service of France</span>
				<span class='text'>The naval [[Battle of Terceira]] took place on 26 July 1582, in the sea near the [[Azores Islands|Azores]], off [[São Miguel Island]], as part of the War of the Portuguese Succession and the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604)]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Spanish navy defeated the combined Anglo-French fleet that had sailed to preserve control of the Azores under António</span>
				<span class='text'>The French naval contingent was the largest French force sent overseas before the age of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jan Glete p</span>
				<span class='text'>56&lt;/ref&gt;The Spanish victory at Terceira was followed by the [[Conquest of the Azores|Battle of the Azores]] between the Portuguese loyal to the claimant António, supported by French and English troops, and the Spanish-Portuguese forces loyal to Philip commanded by the admiral Don [[Álvaro de Bazán, 1st Marquis of Santa Cruz|Álvaro de Bazán]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Victory in Azores completed the incorporation of [[Spanish Empire|Portugal into the Spanish Empire]]</span>

				<span class='text'>22&lt;/ref&gt;Philip financed the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]] during the French Wars of Religion</span>
				<span class='text'>He directly intervened in the final phases of the wars (1589–1598), ordering the [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma|Duke of Parma]] into France in an effort to unseat [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], and perhaps dreaming of placing his favourite daughter, Isabel Clara Eugenia, on the French throne</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip's third wife and Isabella's mother Elisabeth had already ceded any claim to the French Crown with her marriage to Philip</span>
				<span class='text'>However the ''[[Parlement de Paris]]'', in power of the Catholic party, gave verdict that Isabella Clara Eugenia was &quot;the legitimate sovereign&quot; of France</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip's interventions in the fighting – sending the Duke of Parma, to end Henry IV's [[Siege of Paris, 1590|siege of Paris]] in 1590 – and the siege of Rouen in 1592 contributed in saving the French Catholic Leagues's cause against a Protestant monarchy</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1593, Henry agreed to convert to Catholicism; weary of war, most French Catholics switched to his side against the hardline core of the Catholic League, who were portrayed by Henry's propagandists as puppets of a foreign monarch, Philip</span>
				<span class='text'>By the end of 1594 certain League members were still working against Henry across the country, but all relied on the support of Spain</span>
				<span class='text'>In January 1595, therefore, Henry officially declared war on Spain, to show Catholics, that Philip was using religion as a cover for an attack on the French state, and Protestants, that he had not become a puppet of Spain through his conversion, while hoping to take the war to Spain and make territorial gain</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Knecht French Civil Wars p272&lt;/ref&gt;French victory at the [[Battle of Fontaine-Française]] marked an end to the Catholic League in France</span>
				<span class='text'>Spain launched a concerted offensive in 1595, taking [[Siege of Doullens|Doullens]], [[Cambrai]] and [[Le Catelet]] and in the spring of 1596 [[Siege of Calais (1596)|capturing Calais]] by April</span>
				<span class='text'>Following the [[Siege of Amiens (1597)|Spanish capture of Amiens]] in March 1597 the French crown laid siege to it until it managed to [[Siege of Amiens (1597)|reconquer Amiens]] from the overstretched Spanish forces in September 1597</span>
				<span class='text'>Henry then negotiated a peace with Spain</span>
				<span class='text'>The war was only drawn to an official close, however, after the [[Edict of Nantes]], with the [[Peace of Vervins]] in May 1598</span>
				<span class='text'>he 1598 Treaty of Vervins was largely a restatement of the 1559 Peace of Câteau-Cambrésis and Spanish forces and subsidies were withdrawn; meanwhile, Henry issued the Edict of Nantes, which offered a high degree of religious toleration for French Protestants</span>
				<span class='text'>The military interventions in France thus ended in an ironic fashion for Philip: they had failed to oust Henry from the throne or suppress Protestantism in France and yet they had played a decisive part in helping the French Catholic cause gain the conversion of Henry, ensuring that Catholicism would remain France's official and majority faith – matters of paramount importance for the devoutly Catholic Spanish king</span>

				<span class='text'>vg|thumb|Flag of Spanish armies under Philip II]]In the early part of his reign Philip was concerned with the rising power of the Ottoman Empire under [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Fear of Islamic domination in the Mediterranean caused him to pursue an aggressive foreign policy</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1558, Turkish admiral [[Piyale Pasha]] captured the [[Balearic Islands]], especially inflicting great damage on [[Minorca]] and enslaving many, while raiding the coasts of the Spanish mainland</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip appealed to the Pope and other powers in Europe to bring an end to the rising [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] threat</span>
				<span class='text'>Since his father's losses against the Ottomans and against [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]] in 1541, the major European sea powers in the Mediterranean, namely Spain and [[Venice]], became hesitant in confronting the Ottomans</span>
				<span class='text'>The myth of &quot;Turkish invincibility&quot; was becoming a popular story, causing fear and panic among the people</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1560, Philip II organised a ''Holy League'' between Spain and the [[Republic of Venice]], the [[Republic of Genoa]], the [[Papal States]], the [[Duchy of Savoy]] and the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of Malta]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The joint fleet was assembled at [[Messina]] and consisted of 200 ships (60 galleys and 140 other vessels) carrying a total of 30,000 soldiers under the command of [[Giovanni Andrea Doria]], nephew of the famous Genoese admiral [[Andrea Doria]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 12 March 1560, the Holy League captured the island of [[Djerba]] which had a strategic location and could control the sea routes between [[Algiers]] and [[Tripoli]]</span>
				<span class='text'>As a response, [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] sent an Ottoman fleet of 120 ships under the command of [[Piyale Pasha]], which arrived at Djerba on 9 May 1560</span>
				<span class='text'>The battle lasted until 14 May 1560, and the forces of Piyale Pasha and [[Turgut Reis]] (who joined Piyale Pasha on the third day of the battle) had an overwhelming victory at the [[Battle of Djerba]]</span>
				<span class='text'>he Holy League lost 60 ships (30 galleys) and 20,000 men, and Giovanni Andrea Doria was barely able to escape with a small vessel</span>
				<span class='text'>The Ottomans retook the Fortress of Djerba, whose Spanish commander, D</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Álvaro de Sande]] attempted to escape with a ship but was followed and eventually captured by [[Turgut Reis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1565 the Ottomans sent [[Siege of Malta (1565)|a large expedition to Malta]], which laid siege to several forts on the island, taking some of them</span>
				<span class='text'>The Spanish sent a relief force, which finally drove the Ottoman army out of the island</span>
				<span class='text'>he grave threat posed by the increasing Ottoman domination of the Mediterranean was reversed in one of history's most decisive battles, with the destruction of nearly the entire Ottoman fleet at the [[Battle of Lepanto]] in 1571, by the Holy League under the command of Philip's half brother, [[John of Austria|Don Juan of Austria]]</span>
				<span class='text'>A fleet sent by Philip, again commanded by Don John, reconquered Tunis from the Ottomans in 1573</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the Turks soon rebuilt their fleet and in 1574 [[Uluç Ali Reis]] managed to recapture [[Conquest of Tunis (1574)|Tunis]] with a force of 250 galleys and a siege which lasted 40 days</span>
				<span class='text'>However, [[Battle of Lepanto|Lepanto]] marked a permanent reversal in the balance of naval power in the Mediterranean and the end of the threat of Ottoman control</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1585 a peace treaty was signed with the Ottomans</span>
				<span class='text'>=Revolt in the Netherlands=={{Main| Dutch Revolt}}Philip's rule in the seventeen separate provinces known collectively as the Netherlands faced many difficulties; this led to open warfare in 1568</span>
				<span class='text'>He insisted on direct control over events in the Netherlands despite being over two weeks' ride away in Madrid</span>
				<span class='text'>There was discontent in the Netherlands about Philip's taxation demands, and the incessant [[Inquisition of the Netherlands|persecution]] of Protestants</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1566, Protestant preachers sparked anti-clerical riots known as the [[Dutch Revolt#1566 — Iconoclasm and repression|Iconoclast Fury]]; in response to growing Protestant influence, the Duke of Alba's army went on the offensive, further alienating the local aristocracy</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1572 a prominent exiled member of the Dutch aristocracy, [[William the Silent]] (Prince of Orange), invaded the Netherlands with a Protestant army, but he only succeeded in holding two provinces, [[Holland]] and [[Zeeland]]</span>
				<span class='text'>he war continued</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] of the northern provinces, united in the 1579 [[Union of Utrecht]], passed an [[Act of Abjuration]] declaring that they no longer recognised Philip as their king</span>
				<span class='text'>The southern Netherlands (what is now Belgium and Luxembourg) remained under Spanish rule</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1584, [[William the Silent]] was assassinated by [[Balthasar Gérard]], after Philip had offered a reward of 25,000 crowns to anyone who killed him, calling him a &quot;pest on the whole of Christianity and the enemy of the human race&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The Dutch forces continued to fight on under Orange's son [[Maurice of Nassau]], who received modest help from [[Queen Elizabeth I]] in 1585</span>
				<span class='text'>The Dutch gained an advantage over the Spanish because of their growing economic strength, in contrast to Philip's burgeoning economic troubles</span>
				<span class='text'>The war, known as the [[Eighty Years' War]], only came to an end in 1648, when the Dutch Republic was recognised by Spain as independent</span>

				<span class='text'>he execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1587 ended Philip's hopes of placing a Catholic on the English throne</span>
				<span class='text'>He turned instead to more direct plans to invade England, with vague plans to return the country to Catholicism</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1588, he sent a fleet, the [[Spanish Armada]], to rendezvous with the [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma|Duke of Parma]]'s army and convey it across the English Channel</span>

				<span class='text'>=Legacy=={{Main|Cultural depictions of Philip II of Spain}}Under Philip II, Spain reached the peak of its power</span>
				<span class='text'>However, in spite of the great and increasing quantities of gold and silver flowing into his coffers from the American mines, the riches of the Portuguese spice trade, and the enthusiastic support of the Habsburg dominions for the [[Counter-Reformation]], he would never succeed in suppressing Protestantism or defeating the Dutch rebellion</span>
				<span class='text'>Early in his reign, the Dutch might have laid down their weapons if he had desisted in trying to suppress Protestantism,{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} but his devotion to Catholicism would not permit him to do so</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a devout Catholic and exhibited the typical 16th century disdain for religious heterodoxy; he said, &quot;Before suffering the slightest damage to religion in the service of God, I would lose all of my estates and a hundred lives, if I had them, because I do not wish nor do I desire to be the ruler of heretics</span>

				<span class='text'>BBC</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The defeat of Protestantism was always keen in Philip's mind</span>
				<span class='text'> For a while, he ruled England jointly with Queen Mary Tudor and a reconciliation with the Catholic Church followed</span>
				<span class='text'>Heresy trials were reestablished and hundreds of Protestants burned at the stake</span>
				<span class='text'> England and Philip parted ways after the death of his Queen, nicknamed &quot;Bloody Mary&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip's gravest mistake over the long run was his attempt to violently eradicate Protestantism from the Netherlands which was a major economic asset for the empire</span>
				<span class='text'> Under harsh occupation, the Dutch finally rebelled and wrested independence after an eighty-year war, the strain of which did Philip's realm little good</span>
				<span class='text'> His greatest battlefield accomplishment was the defeat of the Ottoman fleet at Lepanto which turned the tide against Turkish aggression</span>
				<span class='text'>s he strove to enforce Catholic orthodoxy through an intensification of the [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]], students were barred from studying elsewhere and books printed by Spaniards outside the kingdom were banned</span>
				<span class='text'>Even a highly respected churchman like [[Bartolome Carranza|Archbishop Carranza]] of Toledo was jailed by the Inquisition for seventeen years for publishing ideas that seemed sympathetic in some degree to Protestantism</span>
				<span class='text'>Such strict enforcement of orthodox belief was successful and Spain avoided the religiously inspired strife tearing apart other European dominions</span>
				<span class='text'>et the [[School of Salamanca]] flourished under his reign</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Martín de Azpilcueta]], highly honoured at Rome by several popes, and looked on as an oracle of learning, published his ''Manuale sive Enchiridion Confessariorum et Poenitentium'' (Rome, 1568), long a classical text in the schools and in ecclesiastical practice</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Francisco Suárez]], generally regarded as the greatest scholastic after [[Thomas Aquinas]] and regarded during his lifetime as being the greatest living philosopher and theologian, was writing and lecturing, not only in Spain but also in Rome (1680–1685), where [[Pope Gregory XIII]] attended the first lecture that he gave</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Luis de Molina]] published his ''De liberi arbitrii cum gratiae donis, divina praescientia, praedestinatione et reprobatione concordia'' (1588), wherein he put forth the doctrine attempting to reconcile the [[omniscience]] of God with human [[free will]] that came to be known as [[Molinism]], thereby contributing to what was one of the most important intellectual debates of the time; Molinism became the ''de facto'' [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] doctrine on the aforementioned matters, and is still advocated today by [[William Lane Craig]] and [[Alvin Plantinga]], among others</span>

				<span class='text'>Yet again, the several points of view towards his reign are mentioned in the Introduction&lt;/ref&gt; Even before his death in 1598, his supporters had started presenting him as an archetypical gentleman, full of piety and Christian virtues, whereas his enemies depicted him as a fanatical and despotic monster, keen in inhuman cruelties and barbarism</span>

				<span class='text'>Cultural depictions of the king are mentioned, although Kamen tends to place himself with those favouring the king&lt;/ref&gt; This dichotomy, further developed into the so-called Spanish [[Black Legend]] and White Legend, was helped by King Philip himself</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip prohibited any biographical account of his life to be published while he was alive, and he ordered that all his private correspondence be burned shortly before he died</span>

				<span class='text'>He discusses the lack of correspondence of the king because he ordered it burned, thus avoiding any chance of getting further into Philip's private life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Philip did nothing to defend himself after being betrayed by his ambitious secretary [[Antonio Perez]], who published incredible calumnies against his former master; this allowed Perez's tales to spread all around Europe unchallenged</span>

				<span class='text'>Judiciously argued review on the harm Perez did to the king, analyzing the king's responsibility on the assassination of Escobedo&lt;/ref&gt; That way, the popular image of the king that survives to today was created on the eve of his death, at a time when many European princes and religious leaders were turned against Spain as a pillar of the [[Counter-Reformation]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This means that many histories depict Philip from deeply prejudiced points of view, usually negative</span>

				<span class='text'>The Invincible Armada (by James Johonnot) |publisher=Authorama</span>
				<span class='text'>om |accessdate=2012-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some historians classify this anti-Spanish analysis as part of the [[Black Legend]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In a more recent example of popular culture, Philip II's portrayal in ''[[Fire Over England]]'' (1937) is not entirely unsympathetic; he is shown as a very hard working, intelligent, religious, somewhat paranoid ruler whose prime concern is his country but who had no understanding of the English, despite his former co-monarchy there</span>
				<span class='text'>ven in countries that remained Catholic, primarily France and the Italian states, fear and envy of Spanish success and domination created a wide receptiveness for the worst possible descriptions of Philip II</span>
				<span class='text'>Although some efforts have been made to separate legend from reality,&lt;ref&gt;Hume, Martin</span>
				<span class='text'>''Philip II of Spain'', London, 1897</span>
				<span class='text'>Martin tried to retrieve the prejudiced views on the king at his time, something Carl Bratli also tried to do in his ''Filip of Spanien'' (Koebenhaven, 1909)</span>
				<span class='text'>Their works oppose to those of Ludwig Pfandl, ''Felipe II</span>
				<span class='text'>Bosquejo de una vida y un tiempo'', Munich, 1938, who assessed very negatively Felipe's personality&lt;/ref&gt; that task has been proven to be extremely hard, since many prejudices are rooted in the cultural heritage of European countries</span>
				<span class='text'>Spanish-speaking historians tend to assess his political and military achievements, sometimes deliberately avoiding issues such as the king's lukewarmness (or even support) towards Catholic fanaticism</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;In his work, ''Felipe II'' (Madrid, 1943) W</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Walsh depicts Felipe's reign as a prosperous and successful one, tending to make an apology of it</span>
				<span class='text'>Fernández Álvarez, in ''España y los españoles en la Edad Moderna'' (Salamanca, 1979), points out how White Legend supporters flourished during the 1940s and 1950s, and how they omitted the darkest issues of Felipe's reign&lt;/ref&gt; English-speaking historians tend to show Philip II as a fanatical, despotical, criminal, imperialist monster,&lt;ref&gt;Those kinds of adjectives can be read in M</span>
				<span class='text'>Van Durme's 1953 ''El Cardenal Granvela''&lt;/ref&gt; minimising his military victories ([[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Battle of Lepanto]], [[Battle of St</span>
				<span class='text'>Quentin (1557)|Battle of Saint Quentin]], etc</span>
				<span class='text'> to mere anecdotes, and magnifying his defeats (namely the [[Invincible Armada]]&lt;ref&gt;Cabrera de Córdoba, ''Felipe II rey de España'', ed</span>
				<span class='text'>RAH, 1877, criticizes how Felipe's victories are being minimised by English historians, and points out the small consequences of defeats such as the Invincible Armada&lt;/ref&gt;) even though at the time those defeats did not result in great political or military changes in the balance of power in Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, it has been noted that objectively assessing Philip's reign would suppose to re-analyze the reign of his greatest opponents, namely England's Queen [[Elizabeth I]] and the Dutch [[William the Silent]], who are popularly regarded as great heroes in their home nations; if Philip II is to be shown to the English or Dutch public in a more favourable light, Elizabeth and William would lose their cold-blooded, fanatical enemy, thus decreasing their own patriotic accomplishments</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;This appreciation is noted by Martin Hume in his aforementioned work (&quot;Philip II of Spain&quot;, London 1897), pointing out how difficult is to show Philip II in a more favorable light to his fellow Englishmen because of that</span>

				<span class='text'>hilip's second wife was his first cousin once removed, Queen [[Mary I of England]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The 1554 marriage to Mary was political</span>
				<span class='text'>By this marriage, Philip became ''[[jure uxoris]]'' [[List of English monarchs|King of England]] and [[King of Ireland|Ireland]], although the couple was apart more than together as they ruled their respective countries</span>
				<span class='text'>The marriage produced no children and Mary died in 1558, ending Philip's reign in England and Ireland</span>
				<span class='text'>hilip's third wife was [[Elisabeth of Valois]], the eldest daughter of [[Henry II of France]] and [[Catherine de' Medici]]</span>

				<span class='text'> Miscarried daughter (3 October 1568)</span>
				<span class='text'>hilip's fourth and final wife was his sororal niece, [[Anna of Austria (1549–1580)|Anna of Austria]]</span>
				<span class='text'>By contemporary accounts, this was a convivial and satisfactory marriage (1570–1580) for both Philip and Anna</span>
				<span class='text'>This marriage produced four sons and one daughter</span>
				<span class='text'>Anna died of heart failure 8 months after giving birth to Maria in 1580</span>
				<span class='text'>Their children were:* [[Ferdinand, Prince of Asturias]] (4 December 1571 – 18 October 1578), died young</span>
