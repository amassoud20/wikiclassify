				<span class='text'>Faulkner wrote novels, short stories, a play, poetry, essays, and screenplays</span>
				<span class='text'>He is primarily known for his novels and short stories set in the fictional [[Yoknapatawpha County]], based on [[Lafayette County, Mississippi]], where he spent most of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', July 11, 1962</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Faulkner is one of the most celebrated writers in [[American literature]] generally and [[Southern literature]] specifically</span>
				<span class='text'>Though his work was published as early as 1919, and largely during the 1920s and 1930s, Faulkner was relatively unknown until receiving the 1949 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], for which he became the only [[Mississippi]]-born Nobel laureate</span>
				<span class='text'>Two of his works, ''[[A Fable]]'' (1954) and his last novel ''[[The Reivers]]'' (1962), won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=pulitzer/&gt; In 1998, the [[Modern Library]] ranked his 1929 novel ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]'' sixth on its list of the [[Modern Library 100 Best Novels|100 best English-language novels of the 20th century]]; also on the list were ''[[As I Lay Dying (novel)|As I Lay Dying]]'' (1930) and ''[[Light in August]]'' (1932)</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[Absalom, Absalom!]]'' (1936) is often included on similar lists</span>
				<span class='text'>=Biography==Faulkner was born William (Cuthbert) Falkner in [[New Albany, Mississippi]], the first of four sons of Murry Cuthbert Falkner (August 17, 1870 – August 7, 1932) and Maud Butler (November 27, 1871 – October 19, 1960)</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He had three younger brothers: Murry Charles &quot;Jack&quot; Falkner (June 26, 1899 – December 24, 1975), author John Falkner (September 24, 1901 – March 28, 1963), and Dean Swift Falkner (August 15, 1907 – November 10, 1935)</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon after his first birthday, his family moved to [[Ripley, Mississippi]], where his father worked as the treasurer for the family-owned Gulf &amp; Chicago Railroad Company</span>
				<span class='text'>Murry hoped to inherit the railroad from his father, John Wesley Thompson Falkner, but John had little confidence in Murry's ability to run a business and sold it for $75,000</span>
				<span class='text'>Following the sale of the railroad business, Murry became disappointed and planned a new start for his family by moving to Texas and becoming a rancher</span>
				<span class='text'>Maud, however, disagreed with this proposition, and it was decided that they would move to [[Oxford, Mississippi]], where Murry's father owned several businesses, making it easy for Murry to find work</span>

				<span class='text'>rg]]&lt;/ref&gt;His family, particularly his mother Maud, his maternal grandmother Lelia Butler, and Caroline Barr (the black woman who raised him from infancy) crucially influenced the development of Faulkner's artistic imagination</span>
				<span class='text'>Both his mother and grandmother were avid readers and also painters and photographers, educating him in visual language</span>
				<span class='text'>While Murry enjoyed the outdoors and encouraged his sons to hunt, track, and fish, Maud valued education and took pleasure in reading and going to church</span>

				<span class='text'>ISBN 0-300-16568-4&lt;/ref&gt;As a schoolchild, Faulkner had much success early on</span>
				<span class='text'>He excelled in the first grade, skipped the second, and continued doing well through the third and fourth grades</span>
				<span class='text'>However, beginning somewhere in the fourth and fifth grades of his schooling, Faulkner became a much more quiet and withdrawn child</span>
				<span class='text'>He began to play hooky occasionally and became somewhat indifferent to his schoolwork, even though he began to study the history of Mississippi on his own time in the seventh grade</span>
				<span class='text'>The decline of his performance in school continued and Faulkner wound up repeating the eleventh, and then final grade, and never graduating from high school</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;Faulkner also spent much of his boyhood listening to stories told to him by his elders</span>
				<span class='text'>These included war stories shared by the old men of Oxford and stories told by Mammy Callie of the Civil War, slavery, the Ku Klux Klan, and the Falkner family</span>
				<span class='text'>Faulkner's grandfather would also tell him of the exploits of William's great-grandfather, after whom he was named, [[William Clark Falkner]], who was a successful businessman, writer, and a Civil War hero</span>
				<span class='text'>Telling stories about William Clark Falkner, whom the family called &quot;Old Colonel&quot;, had already become something of a family pastime when Faulkner was a boy</span>

				<span class='text'>Stone was four years his senior and came from one of Oxford's older families; he was passionate about literature and had already earned bachelor's degrees from Yale and the University of Mississippi</span>
				<span class='text'>At the University of Mississippi, Faulkner joined the [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] fraternity</span>
				<span class='text'>There he was supported in his dream to become a writer</span>
				<span class='text'>Stone read and was impressed by some of Faulkner's early poetry and was one of the first to discover Faulkner's talent and artistic potential</span>
				<span class='text'>Stone became a literary mentor to the young Faulkner, introducing him to writers such as [[James Joyce]], who would come to have an influence on Faulkner's own writing</span>
				<span class='text'>In his early 20s, Faulkner would give poems and short stories he had written to Stone, in hopes of them being published</span>
				<span class='text'>Stone would in turn send these to publishers, but they were uniformly rejected</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Coughlan, Robert 1953&quot;/&gt;The younger Faulkner was greatly influenced by the history of his family and the region in which he lived</span>
				<span class='text'>Mississippi marked his sense of humor, his sense of the tragic position of Black and White Americans, his characterization of Southern characters, and his timeless themes, including fiercely intelligent people dwelling behind the façades of [[good old boys]] and simpletons</span>
				<span class='text'>Unable to join the [[United States Army]] due to his height (he was 5' 5½&quot;), Faulkner enlisted in a reservist unit of the [[British Army]] in Toronto</span>

				<span class='text'>This novel drew heavily on the traditions and history of the South, in which Faulkner had been engrossed in his youth</span>
				<span class='text'>He was extremely proud of the novel upon its completion and he believed it to be a significant step up from his previous two novels</span>
				<span class='text'>However, when submitted for publication, it was rejected by the publishers Boni &amp; Liveright</span>
				<span class='text'>Faulkner was devastated by this rejection, but he eventually allowed his literary agent, Ben Wasson, to significantly edit the text, and the novel was finally published in 1928 as ''Sartoris''</span>

				<span class='text'>He started by writing three short stories about a group of children with the last name Compson, but soon began to feel that the characters he had created might be better suited for a full-length novel</span>
				<span class='text'>Perhaps as a result of disappointment in the initial rejection of ''Flags in the Dust'', Faulkner had now become indifferent to his publishers and wrote this novel in a much more experimental style</span>
				<span class='text'>In describing the writing process for this work, Faulkner would later say, &quot;One day I seemed to shut the door between me and all publisher's addresses and book lists</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Writing==From the early 1920s to the outbreak of World War II, when he left for California, Faulkner published 13 novels and many short stories</span>
				<span class='text'>Such a body of work formed the basis of his reputation and led to his being awarded the Nobel Prize at age 52</span>
				<span class='text'>Faulkner's prodigious output, mainly driven by an obscure writer's need for money, includes his most celebrated novels such as ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]'' (1929), ''[[As I Lay Dying (novel)|As I Lay Dying]]'' (1930), ''[[Light in August]]'' (1932), and ''[[Absalom, Absalom!]]'' (1936)</span>

				<span class='text'>is first short story collection, ''[[These 13]]'' (1931), includes many of his most acclaimed (and most frequently [[anthology|anthologized]]) stories, including &quot;[[A Rose for Emily]]&quot;, &quot;[[Red Leaves]]&quot;, &quot;[[That Evening Sun]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Dry September]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Faulkner set many of his short stories and novels in [[Yoknapatawpha County]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize</span>

				<span class='text'>Yoknapatawpha was Faulkner's &quot;postage stamp&quot;, and the bulk of work that it represents is widely considered by critics to amount to one of the most monumental fictional creations in the history of literature</span>
				<span class='text'>Three novels, ''[[The Hamlet]]'', ''[[The Town (1957 novel)|The Town]]'' and ''[[The Mansion (book)|The Mansion]]'', known collectively as the Snopes Trilogy, document the town of Jefferson and its environs, as an extended family headed by Flem Snopes insinuates itself into the lives and psyches of the general populace</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Faulkner was known for his experimental style with meticulous attention to [[diction]] and [[wikt:cadence|cadence]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In contrast to the [[minimalism|minimalist]] understatement of his contemporary [[Ernest Hemingway]], Faulkner made frequent use of &quot;[[stream of consciousness writing|stream of consciousness]]&quot; in his writing, and wrote often highly emotional, subtle, cerebral, complex, and sometimes [[Southern Gothic|Gothic]] or [[Grotesque#In literature|grotesque]] stories of a wide variety of characters including former slaves or descendants of slaves, poor white, agrarian, or working-class Southerners, and Southern aristocrats</span>
				<span class='text'>n an interview with ''[[The Paris Review]]'' in 1956, Faulkner remarked: &lt;blockquote&gt;Let the writer take up surgery or bricklaying if he is interested in technique</span>
				<span class='text'>There is no mechanical way to get the writing done, no shortcut</span>
				<span class='text'>The young writer would be a fool to follow a theory</span>
				<span class='text'>Teach yourself by your own mistakes; people learn only by error</span>
				<span class='text'>The good artist believes that nobody is good enough to give him advice</span>
				<span class='text'>He has supreme vanity</span>
				<span class='text'>No matter how much he admires the old writer, he wants to beat him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/blockquote&gt; Another esteemed Southern writer, [[Flannery O'Connor]], stated that &quot;the presence alone of Faulkner in our midst makes a great difference in what the writer can and cannot permit himself to do</span>
				<span class='text'>Nobody wants his mule and wagon stalled on the same track the Dixie Limited is roaring down&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>quot; ''Atlantic Monthly'' 285 (2000): 76</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Faulkner wrote two volumes of poetry which were published in small printings, ''The Marble Faun'' (1924)&lt;ref&gt;This book shares a title with ''[[The Marble Faun]]'' (1860), one of the novels of [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and ''A Green Bough'' (1933), and a collection of crime-fiction short stories, ''Knight's Gambit'' (1949)</span>
				<span class='text'>=Criticism==Faulkner's work has been examined by many critics from a wide variety of critical perspectives</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[New Critics]] became very interested in Faulkner's work, with [[Cleanth Brooks]] writing ''The Yoknapatawpha Country'' and Michael Millgate writing ''The Achievement of William Faulkner''</span>
				<span class='text'>Since then, critics have looked at Faulkner's work using other approaches, such as feminist and psychoanalytic methods</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;According to critic and translator [[Valerie Miles]], Faulkner's influence on Latin American fiction is considerable, with fictional worlds created by [[Gabriel Garcia Marquez]] ([[Macondo]]) and [[Juan Carlos Onetti]] (Santa Maria) being &quot;very much in the vein of&quot; Yoknapatawpha: &quot;''[[The Death of Artemio Cruz]]'' wouldn't exist if not for ''[[As I Lay Dying]]''&quot;</span>
