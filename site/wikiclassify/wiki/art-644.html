				<span class='text'>&quot;Personality Number 2&quot; was a dignified, authoritative and influential man from the past</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Jung was close to both parents, he was disappointed by his father's academic approach to faith</span>
				<span class='text'> number of childhood memories made lifelong impressions on him</span>
				<span class='text'>As a boy he carved a tiny [[mannequin]] into the end of the wooden ruler from his pencil case and placed it inside the case</span>

				<span class='text'>Years later he discovered similarities between his personal experience and the practices associated with [[totem]]s in indigenous cultures, such as the collection of soul-stones near [[Arlesheim]] or the ''[[tjurunga]]s'' of Australia</span>
				<span class='text'>He concluded that his intuitive ceremonial act was an unconscious ritual, which he had practiced in a way that was strikingly similar to those in distant locations which he, as a young boy, knew nothing about</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Memories, Dreams, Reflections |pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; His conclusions about symbols, [[Jungian archetypes|psychological archetypes]], and the [[collective unconscious]] were inspired, in part, by these experiences</span>
				<span class='text'>t the age of twelve, shortly before the end of his first year at the [[:de:Gymnasium am Münsterplatz|Humanistisches Gymnasium]] in Basel, Jung was pushed to the ground by another boy so hard that he momentarily lost consciousness</span>
				<span class='text'>(Jung later recognized that the incident was his fault, indirectly</span>
				<span class='text'> A thought then came to him—&quot;now you won't have to go to school anymore</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Memories, Dreams, Reflections |page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; From then on, whenever he walked to school or began homework, he fainted</span>
				<span class='text'>He remained at home for the next six months until he overheard his father speaking hurriedly to a visitor about the boy's future ability to support himself</span>
				<span class='text'>They suspected he had [[epilepsy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Confronted with the reality of his family's poverty, he realized the need for academic excellence</span>
				<span class='text'>He went into his father's study and began poring over [[Latin grammar]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He fainted three more times but eventually overcame the urge and did not faint again</span>
				<span class='text'>This event, Jung later recalled, &quot;was when I learned what a [[neurosis]] is</span>

				<span class='text'>But, studying a psychiatric textbook, he became very excited when he discovered that [[psychoses]] are personality diseases</span>

				<span class='text'>n 1900 Jung began working at the [[Burghölzli]] psychiatric hospital in [[Zürich]] with [[Eugen Bleuler]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Bleuler was already in communication with the Austrian neurologist [[Sigmund Freud]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Jung's [[dissertation]], published in 1903, was titled ''On the Psychology and Pathology of So-Called Occult Phenomena</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In 1912, however, Jung published ''Wandlungen und Symbole der Libido'' (known in English as ''[[Psychology of the Unconscious]]''), which made manifest the developing theoretical divergence between the two</span>
				<span class='text'>Consequently, their personal and professional relationship fractured—each stating that the other was unable to admit he could possibly be wrong</span>
				<span class='text'>After the culminating break in 1913, Jung went through a difficult and pivotal psychological transformation, exacerbated by the outbreak of the First World War</span>

				<span class='text'>This rejection caused what Jung described in his autobiography ''Memories, Dreams, Reflections,'' as a &quot;resounding censure</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1906 [[psychology]] as a science was still in its early stages</span>
				<span class='text'>Jung, who had become interested in psychiatry as a student by reading ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis]]'' by [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]], a professor in Vienna, by then worked as a doctor under the psychiatrist [[Eugen Bleuler]] in Burghölzli</span>
				<span class='text'>He became familiar with Freud's idea of the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] through reading Freud's ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' (1899)</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1910, Jung became Chairman for Life of the [[International Psychoanalytical Association]]</span>
				<span class='text'>While Jung worked on his ''Wandlungen und Symbole der Libido (Psychology of the Unconscious)'', tensions grew between him and Freud because of their disagreements over the nature of [[libido]] and religion</span>
				<span class='text'>{clarify|date=December 2009}} In 1912 these tensions came to a peak because Jung felt severely slighted after Freud visited his colleague [[Ludwig Binswanger]] in [[Kreuzlingen]] without paying him a visit in nearby Zurich, an incident Jung referred to as &quot;the Kreuzlingen gesture&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Jung applied the term ''[[persona]]'', explicitly because, in Latin, it means both ''personality'' and the ''masks'' worn by Roman actors of the [[Classical antiquity|classical period]], expressive of the individual roles played</span>
				<span class='text'>he ''persona'', he argues, is a mask for the &quot;collective psyche&quot;, a mask that 'pretends' individuality, so that both self and others believe in that identity, even if it is really no more than a well-played ''role'' through which the collective psyche is expressed</span>
				<span class='text'>Jung regarded the &quot;persona-mask&quot; as a complicated system which ''mediates'' between individual consciousness and the social community: it is &quot;a compromise between the individual and society as to what a man should appear to be&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>106</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; But he also makes it quite explicit that it is, in substance, a ''character mask'' in the classical sense known to theatre, with its double function: both intended to make a certain impression to others, and to hide (part of) the true nature of the individual</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The therapist then aims to assist the [[individuation]] process through which the client (re)gains his &quot;own self&quot; – by liberating the self, both from the deceptive cover of the ''persona'', and from the power of unconscious impulses</span>

				<span class='text'>azard took Jung's advice seriously and set about seeking a personal spiritual experience</span>
