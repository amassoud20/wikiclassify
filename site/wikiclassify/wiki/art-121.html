				<span class='text'>e accepted a commission to write a book on computer [[programming language]] [[compiler]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>While working on this project, Knuth decided that he could not adequately treat the topic without first developing a fundamental theory of computer programming, which became ''[[The Art of Computer Programming]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>He originally planned to publish this as a single book</span>
				<span class='text'>As Knuth developed his outline for the book, he concluded that he required six volumes, and then seven, to thoroughly cover the subject</span>
				<span class='text'>He published the first volume in 1968</span>
				<span class='text'>ust before publishing the first volume of ''The Art of Computer Programming'', Knuth left Caltech to accept employment with the [[Institute for Defense Analyses#Center for Communications and Computing|Institute for Defense Analyses' Communications Research Division]], then situated on the [[Princeton University]] campus, which was performing mathematical research in [[cryptography]] to support the [[National Security Agency]]</span>

				<span class='text'>A lot of the papers coming out were quite simply wrong</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> So one of my motivations was to put straight a story that had been very badly told</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;After producing the third volume of his series in 1976, he expressed such frustration with the nascent state of the then newly developed electronic publishing tools (especially those that provided input to phototypesetters) that he took time out to work on typesetting and created the [[TeX]] and [[METAFONT]] tools</span>

				<span class='text'>Instead of simply explaining the subject, the book seeks to show the development of the mathematics</span>
				<span class='text'>Knuth wanted the book to prepare students for doing original, creative research</span>

				<span class='text'> Each verse is accompanied by a rendering in calligraphic art, contributed by a group of calligraphers under the leadership of [[Hermann Zapf]]</span>
