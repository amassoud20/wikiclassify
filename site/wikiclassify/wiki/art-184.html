				<span class='text'>Born in Italy and raised in [[Los Angeles]] from the age of five, his [[rags-to-riches]] story has led film historians such as [[Ian Freer]] to consider him the &quot;[[American dream]] personified</span>

				<span class='text'>Among his leading films was ''[[It Happened One Night]]'' (1934), which became the first film to win the &quot;[[List of Big Five Academy Award winners and nominees|Big Five Academy Awards]]&quot;, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]</span>

				<span class='text'>He served as President of the [[Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences]], worked alongside the [[Writers Guild of America, West|Screenwriters Guild]], and was head of the [[Directors Guild of America]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Early life==Capra was born '''Francesco Rosario Capra''' in [[Bisacquino]], [[Sicily]], a village near [[Palermo]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was the youngest of seven children of Salvatore Capra, a fruit grower, and the former Rosaria &quot;Serah&quot; Nicolosi</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He notes that the English word &quot;capricious&quot; derives from it, &quot;evoking the animal's skittish temperament&quot;, adding that &quot;the name neatly expresses two aspects of Frank Capra's personality: emotionalism and obstinacy</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=McBride/&gt;In 1903, when he was five, Capra emigrated to the United States with his family, who traveled in the steerage section of the boat, which was the cheapest way to gain passage</span>
				<span class='text'>For Capra, the journey, which took 13 days, remained in his mind for the rest of his life as one of his worst experiences:{{quote|You're all together – you have no privacy</span>
				<span class='text'>You have a cot</span>
				<span class='text'>Very few people have trunks or anything that takes up space</span>
				<span class='text'>They have just what they can carry in their hands or in a bag</span>

				<span class='text'>He recalls his father's exclamation at the sight:{{quote|Ciccio, look! Look at that! That's the greatest light since the star of Bethlehem! That's the light of freedom! Remember that</span>

				<span class='text'>Instead of working after graduating, as his parents wanted, he enrolled in college</span>
				<span class='text'>He worked through college at the [[California Institute of Technology]], playing banjo at nightclubs and taking odd jobs, which included working at the campus laundry facility, waiting tables, and cleaning engines at a local power plant</span>
				<span class='text'>He studied [[chemical engineering]] and graduated in the spring of 1918</span>

				<span class='text'>96&quot;/&gt;== World War I and after ==Soon after graduating college, Capra was commissioned in the US Army as a [[second lieutenant]], having already worked on the campus [[ROTC]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In the Army, he taught mathematics to artillerymen at [[Fort Point, San Francisco|Fort Scott, San Francisco]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His father died during the war in an accident (1916)</span>

				<span class='text'>96</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Living at home with his siblings and mother, Capra was the only family member with a college education, yet he was the only one who remained chronically unemployed</span>
				<span class='text'>After a year without work, seeing how his siblings had steady jobs, he felt he was a failure, which led to bouts of depression and abdominal pains, later discovered to have been an undiagnosed burst appendix</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman p</span>
				<span class='text'>96&quot;/&gt;After recovering at home, Capra moved out and spent the next few years living in flophouses in San Francisco and hopping freight trains, wandering the Western United States</span>
				<span class='text'>To support himself, he took odd jobs on farms, as a movie extra, playing poker, and selling local oil well stocks</span>
				<span class='text'>In his early twenties, Capra had to undergo a [[circumcision]] due to recurring bouts of [[Sexually transmitted infection|STIs]] (the first of which happened after an anonymous encounter with a woman at a party in San Francisco), which caused severe damage to his [[sex life]], an affliction that lasted until his twilight years</span>

				<span class='text'>1&quot;&gt;Schnakenberg 2010, p</span>
				<span class='text'>51</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;It was during this time that the 24-year-old Capra directed a 32-minute documentary film entitled ''La Visita Dell'Incrociatore Italiano LIBYA a San Francisco''</span>
				<span class='text'>Not only did it document the visit of the Italian naval vessel LIBYA to San Francisco, but also the reception given to the crew of the ship by San Francisco's L'Italia Virtus Club, now known as the [[San Francisco Italian Athletic Club]]</span>
				<span class='text'>t age 25, Capra took a job selling books written and published by American philosopher, [[Elbert Hubbard]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman p</span>
				<span class='text'>96&quot;/&gt;  Capra recalled that he &quot;hated being a peasant, being a scrounging new kid trapped in the Sicilian ghetto of Los Angeles </span>

				<span class='text'>74–76</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Early career=====Silent film comedies===During his book sales efforts{{spaced ndash}}and nearly broke{{spaced ndash}}Capra read a newspaper article about a new movie studio opening in San Francisco</span>
				<span class='text'>Capra phoned them saying he had moved from Hollywood, and falsely implied that he had experience in the budding film industry</span>
				<span class='text'>Capra's only prior exposure to films was in 1915 while attending Manual Arts High School</span>
				<span class='text'>The studio's founder, Walter Montague, was nonetheless impressed by Capra and offered him $75 to direct a one-reel silent film</span>
				<span class='text'>Capra, with the help of a cameraman, made the film in two days and cast it with amateurs</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman p</span>
				<span class='text'>96&quot;/&gt;After that first serious job in films, Capra began efforts to finding similar openings in the film industry</span>
				<span class='text'>He took a position with another minor San Francisco studio, and subsequently received an offer to work with producer [[Harry Cohn]] at his new studio in Los Angeles</span>
				<span class='text'>During this time, he worked as a property man, film cutter, title writer, and assistant director</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman p</span>
				<span class='text'>97&quot;&gt;Wakeman 1987, p</span>
				<span class='text'>97</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Capra later became a gag writer for [[Hal Roach]]'s ''Our Gang'' series and then writer for [[slapstick comedy]] director, [[Mack Sennett]], where he wrote scripts for comedian [[Harry Langdon]]</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Capra, it was he who invented Langdon's character, the innocent fool living in a &quot;naughty world</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman p</span>
				<span class='text'>97&quot;/&gt;When Langdon eventually left Sennett to make longer, feature-length movies with [[First National]] Studios, he took Capra along as his personal writer and director</span>
				<span class='text'>They made three feature films together during 1926 and 1927, all of them successful with critics and the public</span>
				<span class='text'>The films made Langdon a recognized comedian in the caliber of [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Buster Keaton]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Capra and Langdon later had a falling out, and Capra was fired</span>
				<span class='text'>During the following years, Langdon's films went into decline without Capra's assistance</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=April 2013}} After splitting with Langdon, Capra directed a picture for First National, ''[[For the Love of Mike]]'', (1927)</span>
				<span class='text'>This was a silent comedy about three bickering godfathers, a German, a Jew, and an Irishman, starring a budding actress, [[Claudette Colbert]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The movie was considered a failure</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman p</span>
				<span class='text'>97&quot;/&gt;===Columbia Pictures==='''Early sound films'''Capra returned to Harry Cohn's studio, now named [[Columbia Pictures]], which was then producing short films and two-reel comedies used as &quot;fillers&quot;, which played between main features</span>
				<span class='text'>Columbia was one of many start-up studios on &quot;[[Poverty Row]]&quot; in Los Angeles</span>
				<span class='text'>Like the others, Columbia was unable to compete with larger studios which often had their own production facilities, distribution and theaters</span>
				<span class='text'>Cohn rehired Capra in 1928 to help his studio produce new, full-length feature films, to compete with the major studios</span>
				<span class='text'>Capra would eventually direct 20 films for Cohn's studio, including all of his classics</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman p</span>
				<span class='text'>97&quot;/&gt;Because of Capra's engineering education, he adapted more easily to the new sound technology than most directors</span>
				<span class='text'>He welcomed the transition to sound, recalling, &quot;I wasn't at home in silent films</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman p</span>
				<span class='text'>97&quot;/&gt; Most studios were unwilling to invest in the new sound technology, assuming it was a passing fad</span>
				<span class='text'>Many in Hollywood considered sound a threat to the industry and hoped it would pass quickly; McBride notes that &quot;Capra was not one of them</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; When he saw [[Al Jolson]] singing in ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' in 1927, considered the first talkie, Capra recalled his reaction:{{quote|It was an absolute shock to hear this man open his mouth and a song come out of it</span>
				<span class='text'>It was one of those once-in-a-lifetime experiences</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McBride 1992, p</span>
				<span class='text'>200</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;}}Few of the studio heads or crew were aware of Capra's engineering background until he began directing ''[[The Younger Generation]]'' in 1929</span>
				<span class='text'>The chief cinematographer who worked with Capra on a number of films, was likewise unaware</span>
				<span class='text'>He describes this early period in sound for film:{{quote|It wasn't something that came up</span>
				<span class='text'>You had to bluff to survive</span>
				<span class='text'>When sound first came in, nobody knew much about it</span>
				<span class='text'>We were all walking around in the dark</span>
				<span class='text'>Even the sound man didn't know much about it</span>
				<span class='text'>Frank lived through it</span>
				<span class='text'>But he was quite intelligent</span>
				<span class='text'>He was one of the few directors who knew what the hell they were doing</span>
				<span class='text'>Most of your directors walked around in a fog – they didn't know where the door was</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McBride 1992, p</span>
				<span class='text'>201</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;}}During his first year with Columbia, Capra directed nine films, some of which were successful</span>
				<span class='text'>After the first few, Harry Cohn said &quot;it was the beginning of Columbia making a better quality of pictures</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;McBride 1992, p</span>
				<span class='text'>189</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; According to Barson, &quot;Capra became ensconced as Harry Cohn's most trusted director</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=Barson/&gt; His films soon established Capra as a &quot;bankable&quot; director known throughout the industry, and Cohn raised Capra's initial salary of $1,000 per film to $25,000 per year</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman p</span>
				<span class='text'>97&quot;/&gt; Capra directed a film for MGM during this period, but soon realized he &quot;had much more freedom under Harry Cohn's benevolent dictatorship&quot;, where Cohn also put Capra's &quot;name above the title&quot; of his films, a first for the movie industry</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McBride 1992, p</span>
				<span class='text'>197</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Capra wrote of this period and recalled the confidence that Cohn placed in Capra's vision and directing:{{quote|I owed Cohn a lot – I owed him my whole career</span>
				<span class='text'>So I had respect for him, and a certain amount of love</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite his crudeness and everything else, he gave me my chance</span>
				<span class='text'>He took a gamble on me</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McBride 1992, p</span>
				<span class='text'>199</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;}}Capra directed his first &quot;real&quot; sound picture, ''[[The Younger Generation]]'', in 1929</span>
				<span class='text'>It was a rags-to-riches romantic comedy about a Jewish family's upward mobility in New York City, with their son later trying to deny his Jewish roots in order to keep his rich gentile girlfriend</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Capra biographer [[Joseph McBride (writer)|Joseph McBride]], Capra &quot;obviously felt a strong identification with the story of a Jewish immigrant who grows up in the ghetto of New York</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>and feels he has to deny his ethnic origins to rise to success in America</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;  Capra, however, denied any connection of the story with his own life</span>
				<span class='text'>onetheless, McBride insists that ''[[The Younger Generation]]'' abounds with parallels to Capra's own life</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; McBride notes the &quot;devastatingly painful climactic scene&quot;, where the young social-climbing son, embarrassed when his wealthy new friends first meet his parents, passes his mother and father off as house servants</span>
				<span class='text'>That scene, notes McBride, &quot;echoes the shame Capra admitted feeling toward his own family as he rose in social status</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;McBride 1992, p</span>
				<span class='text'>203</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;During his years at Columbia, Capra worked often with screenwriter [[Robert Riskin]] (husband of [[Fay Wray]]), and cameraman [[Joseph Walker (cinematographer)|Joseph Walker]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In many of Capra's films, the wise-cracking and sharp dialogue was often written by Riskin, and he and Capra went on to become Hollywood's &quot;most admired writer-director team</span>

				<span class='text'>''[[It Happened One Night]]'' (1934) became the first film to win all five top Oscars ([[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Directing|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]], [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]], and [[Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay|Best Screenplay]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Written by [[Robert Riskin]], it is one of the first of the &quot;screwball comedies&quot;, and with its release in the [[Great Depression]], critics considered it an escapist story and a variation of the &quot;American Dream&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The film established the names of Capra, Columbia Pictures, and stars [[Clark Gable]] and [[Claudette Colbert]] in the movie industry</span>
				<span class='text'>The film has been called &quot;[[Picaresque novel|picaresque]]&quot;, and was one of the earliest &quot;road movies&quot; which inspired variations on its theme by other filmmakers</span>

				<span class='text'>99&quot;&gt;Wakeman 1987, p</span>
				<span class='text'>99</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The film was followed by ''[[Broadway Bill]]'' (1934), a screwball comedy about horse racing</span>
				<span class='text'>The film was a turning point for Capra, however, as he began to conceive of an additional dimension to his movies</span>
				<span class='text'>He started using his films to convey messages to the public</span>
				<span class='text'>Capra explains his new thinking:{{quote|My films must let every man, woman, and child know that God loves them, that I love them, and that peace and salvation will become a reality only when they all learn to love each other</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman p</span>
				<span class='text'>99&quot;/&gt;}}This added goal was inspired after meeting with a Christian Scientist friend who told him to view his talents in a different way:{{quote|The talents you have, Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Capra, are not your own, not self-acquired</span>
				<span class='text'>God gave you those talents; they are His gifts to you, to use for His purpose</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman p</span>
				<span class='text'>99&quot;/&gt;}}Capra began to embody messages in subsequent films, many of which conveyed &quot;fantasies of goodwill</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The first of those was ''[[Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Deeds Goes to Town]]'' (1936), for which Capra won his second Best Director Oscar</span>
				<span class='text'>Critic [[Alistair Cooke]] observed that Capra was &quot;starting to make movies about themes instead of people</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In 1938, Capra won his third Director Oscar in five years for ''[[You Can't Take It with You (film)|You Can't Take It with You]]'', which also won Best Picture</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition to his three directing wins, Capra received directing nominations for three other films (''[[Lady for a Day]]'', ''[[Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Smith Goes to Washington]]'', and ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'')</span>
				<span class='text'>On May 5, 1936, Capra hosted the [[8th Academy Awards]] ceremony</span>
				<span class='text'>==''Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Smith Goes to Washington'' (1939)===Although ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' is his best-known film, Friedman notes that it was ''[[Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Smith Goes to Washington]]'' (1939) which most represented the &quot;Capra myth</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; That film expressed Capra's patriotism more than any others, and &quot;presented the individual working within the democratic system to overcome rampant political corruption</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=Friedman/&gt;The film, however, became Capra's most controversial</span>
				<span class='text'>In his research before filming, he was able to stand close to President Roosevelt during a press conference after the recent acts of war by Germany in Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>Capra recalls his fears:{{quote|And panic hit me</span>

				<span class='text'>Friedman finds that while Capra's ideas were popular with depression-era and prewar audiences, they became less relevant to a prospering post-war America</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Friedman/&gt; Biographer [[Joseph McBride (writer)|Joseph McBride]] argues that Capra's disillusionment was more related to the negative effect that the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) had on the film industry in general</span>
				<span class='text'>The HUAC interrogations in the early 1950s ended many Hollywood careers</span>
				<span class='text'>Capra himself was not called to testify, although he was a prime target of the committee due to his past associations with many [[Hollywood blacklist]]ed screenwriters</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Friedman/&gt;Capra blames his early retirement from films on the rising power of stars, which forced him to continually compromise his artistic vision</span>
				<span class='text'>He also claims that increasing budgetary and scheduling demands were constraining his creative abilities</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Friedman/&gt; Film historian [[Michael Medved]] agrees with and understands Capra's impressions, noting that he walked away from the movie business because &quot;he refused to adjust to the cynicism of the new order</span>

				<span class='text'>Film historian and author William S</span>
				<span class='text'>Pechter described Capra's style as one &quot;of almost classical purity</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He adds that his style relied on editing to help his films sustain a &quot;sequence of rhythmic motion</span>

				<span class='text'>102&quot;/&gt;}}Film critic John Raeburn discusses an early Capra film, ''[[American Madness]]'' (1932), as an example of how he had  mastered the movie medium and expressed a unique style:{{quote|The tempo of the film, for example, is perfectly synchronized with the action </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>As the intensity of the panic increases, Capra reduces the duration of each shot and uses more and more crosscutting and jump shots to emphasize the &quot;madness&quot; of what is happening </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Capra added to the naturalistic quality of the dialogue by having speakers overlap one another, as they often do in ordinary life; this was an innovation that helped to move the talkies away from the example of the legitimate stage</span>

				<span class='text'>On the set he was said to be gentle and considerate, &quot;a director who displays absolutely no exhibitionism</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Because Capra's films often carry a message about basic goodness in human nature, and show the value of unselfishness and hard work, his wholesome, feel-good themes have led some cynics to term his style &quot;Capra-corn</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; However, those who hold his vision in higher regard prefer the term &quot;Capraesque&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Capra's basic themes of championing the common man, as well as his use of spontaneous, fast-paced dialogue and goofy, memorable lead and supporting characters, made him one of the most popular and respected filmmakers of the 20th century</span>
				<span class='text'>His influence can be traced in the works of many directors, including [[Robert Altman]],&lt;ref name=&quot;dvdtalk</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Political beliefs==Capra’s political beliefs coalesced in his films, which promoted and celebrated the spirit of American individualism</span>
				<span class='text'>A conservative Republican, Capra railed against [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] during his tenure as governor of New York State, and opposed his presidency during the years of the Depression</span>
				<span class='text'>Capra stood against government intervention during the national economic crisis</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman p</span>
				<span class='text'>103&quot;/&gt; Film historian [[Ian Freer]] notes that at the time of his death in 1991, his legacy remained intact:{{quote|He had created feelgood entertainments before the phrase was invented, and his influence on culture – from Steven Spielberg to David Lynch, and from television soap operas to greeting-card sentiments – is simply too huge to calculate</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Freer/&gt;}}Director/actor [[John Cassavetes]] contemplating Capra’s contribution to the art of film quipped: &quot;Maybe there really wasn't an America, it was only Frank Capra</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; &lt;ref&gt;Lazere 1987, p</span>
				<span class='text'>178</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Capra’s films were his love letters to an idealized America –  a cinematic landscape of his own invention</span>
				<span class='text'>The performances his actors gave were invariable portrayals of  personalities developed into recognizable images of popular culture, &quot;their acting has the bold simplicity of an icon</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot;  &lt;ref&gt;Dickstein 2010, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>479–480</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Like his contemporary, director [[John Ford]], Capra defined and aggrandized the tropes of mythic America where individual courage invariably triumphs over collective evil</span>
				<span class='text'>Film historian Richard Griffith speaks of Capra's &quot;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>eliance on sentimental conversation and the ultimate benevolence of ordinary America to resolve all deep conflicts</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Dickstein  2010, p</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> tree lined street, undistinguished frame houses surrounded by modest areas of grass, a few automobiles</span>
				<span class='text'>For certain purposes it assumed that all ''real ''Americans live in towns like this, and so great is the power of myth, even the born city-dweller is likely to believe vaguely that he too lives on this shady street, or comes from it, or is going to</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;  &lt;ref&gt;Dickstein 2010, p</span>
				<span class='text'>480</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;NYU professor of Humanities and Performing Arts, Leonard Quart writes:&quot;There would be no enduring conflicts – harmony, no matter how contrived and specious, would ultimately triumph in the last frame</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>n true Hollywood fashion, no Capra film would ever suggest that social change was a complex, painful act</span>
				<span class='text'>For Capra, there would be pain and loss, but no enduring sense of tragedy would be allowed to intrude on his fabulist world</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Dickstein  2010, p</span>
				<span class='text'>479&quot;/&gt;The theatre screen was the mirror in front of which American movie audiences sat enamored with the reflected images of their better selves–an idealistic storybook America</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough Capra's stature as a director had declined in the 1950s, his films underwent a revival in the 1960s:{{quote|Ten years later, it was clear that this trend had reversed itself</span>
				<span class='text'>Post-[[auteur]]ist critics once more acclaimed Capra as a cinematic master, and perhaps more surprisingly, young people packed Capra festivals and revivals all over the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman p</span>
				<span class='text'>103&quot;/&gt;}}French film historian John Raeburn, editor of ''[[Cahiers du cinéma]]'', notes that Capra's films were unknown in France, but there too his films underwent a fresh discovery by the public</span>
				<span class='text'>He believes the reason for his renewed popularity had to do with his themes, which he made credible &quot;an ideal conception of an American national character&quot;:{{quote|There is a strong libertarian streak in Capra's films, a distrust of power wherever it occurs and in whomever it is invested</span>
				<span class='text'>Young people are won over by the fact that his heroes are uninterested in wealth and are characterized by vigorous </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>individualism, a zest for experience, and a keen sense of political and social justice</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Capra's heroes, in short, are ideal types, created in the image of a powerful national myth</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman p</span>
				<span class='text'>103&quot;/&gt;}}In 1982, the [[American Film Institute]] honored Capra by giving him their [[AFI Life Achievement Award]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The event was used to create the television film, ''The American Film Institute Salute to Frank Capra'', hosted by James Stewart</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1986, Capra received the [[National Medal of Arts]]</span>
				<span class='text'>uring his acceptance speech for the AFI award, Capra stressed his most important values:{{quote|The art of Frank Capra is very, very simple: It's the love of people</span>
				<span class='text'>Add two simple ideals to this love of people: the freedom of each individual, and the equal importance of each individual, and you have the principle upon which I based all my films</span>
				<span class='text'>}Capra expanded on his visions in his 1971 autobiography, ''The Name Above the Title'':{{quote|Forgotten among the hue-and criers were the hard-working stiffs that came home too tired to shout or demonstrate in streets </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>and prayed they'd have enough left over to keep their kids in college, despite their knowing that some were pot-smoking, parasitic parent-haters</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Who would make films about, and for, these uncomplaining, unsqueaky wheels that greased the squeaky? Not me</span>
				<span class='text'>My &quot;one man, one film&quot; Hollywood had ceased to exist</span>
				<span class='text'>Actors had sliced it up into capital gains</span>
				<span class='text'>And yet – mankind needed dramatizations of the truth that man is essentially good, a living atom of divinity; that compassion for others, friend or foe, is the noblest of all virtues</span>
				<span class='text'>Films must be made to say these things, to counteract the violence and the meanness, to buy time to demobilize the hatreds</span>
