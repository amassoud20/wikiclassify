				<span class='text'>He is generally considered one of the three great seventeenth-century French [[dramatist]]s, along with [[Molière]] and [[Jean Racine]]</span>
				<span class='text'>s a young man, he earned the valuable patronage of [[Cardinal Richelieu]], who was trying to promote classical tragedy along formal lines, but later quarrelled with him, especially over his best-known play ''[[Le Cid]]'' about a medieval Spanish warrior, which was denounced by the newly formed ''[[Académie française]]'' for breaching the [[classical unities|unities]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He continued to write well-received tragedies for nearly forty years</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; His younger brother, [[Thomas Corneille]], also became a noted playwright</span>
				<span class='text'>He was given a rigorous [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] education at the then named ''Collège de Bourbon'' &lt;ref name=&quot;LyCo6&quot;&gt;[http://lgcorneille-lyc</span>

				<span class='text'>hp?article6 Lycée Pierre Corneille de Rouen – History]&lt;/ref&gt; where acting on the stage was part of the [[Jesuit drama|training]]</span>
				<span class='text'>(The collège has been known as the ''[[Lycée Pierre-Corneille]]'' since 1873)</span>
				<span class='text'>At 18 he began to study law but his practical legal endeavors were largely unsuccessful</span>
				<span class='text'>Corneille’s father secured two magisterial posts for him with the Rouen department of Forests and Rivers</span>
				<span class='text'>During his time with the department, he wrote his first play</span>
				<span class='text'>It is unknown exactly when he wrote it, but the play, the [[comedy]] ''[[Mélite]]'', surfaced when Corneille brought it to a group of traveling actors in 1629</span>
				<span class='text'>The actors approved of the work and made it part of their repertoire</span>
				<span class='text'>The play was a success in Paris and Corneille began writing plays on a regular basis</span>
				<span class='text'>He moved to Paris in the same year and soon became one of the leading playwrights of the French stage</span>
				<span class='text'>His early comedies, starting with ''Mélite'', depart from the French farce tradition by reflecting the elevated language and manners of fashionable Parisian society</span>
				<span class='text'>Corneille describes his variety of comedy as &quot;une peinture de la conversation des honnêtes gens&quot; (&quot;a painting of the conversation of the gentry&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>His first true [[tragedy]] is ''Médée'', produced in 1635</span>
				<span class='text'>=={{Lang|fr|Les Cinq Auteurs}}===The year 1634 brought more attention to Corneille</span>
				<span class='text'>He was selected to write verses for the [[Cardinal Richelieu]]’s visit to Rouen</span>
				<span class='text'>The Cardinal took notice of Corneille and selected him to be among ''{{Lang|fr|Les Cinq Auteurs}}'' (&quot;The Five Poets&quot;; also translated as &quot;the society of the five authors&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>The others were [[Guillaume Colletet]], [[Boisrobert]], [[Jean Rotrou]], and [[Claude de L'Estoile]]</span>
				<span class='text'>he five were selected to realize Richelieu's vision of a new kind of drama that emphasized virtue</span>
				<span class='text'>Richelieu would present ideas, which the writers would express in dramatic form</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the Cardinal's demands were too restrictive for Corneille, who attempted to innovate outside the boundaries defined by Richelieu</span>
				<span class='text'>This led to contention between playwright and employer</span>
				<span class='text'>After his initial contract ended, Corneille left ''{{Lang|fr|Les Cinq Auteurs}}'' and returned to Rouen</span>
				<span class='text'>==''Querelle du Cid''===In the years directly following this break with Richelieu, Corneille produced what is considered his finest play</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[Le Cid]]'' (''al sayyid'' in Arabic; roughly translated as &quot;The Lord&quot;) is based on the play ''Mocedades del Cid'' (1621) by [[Guillén de Castro y Bellvis|Guillem de Castro]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Both plays were based on the legend of [[Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar]] (nicknamed &quot;El Cid Campeador&quot;), a military figure in [[Medieval Spain]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Corneille cour Napoleon Louvre</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|upright|Corneille at the Louvre]]The original 1637 edition of the play was subtitled a [[tragicomedy]], acknowledging that it intentionally defies the classical [[tragedy]]/[[comedy]] distinction</span>
				<span class='text'>Even though ''Le Cid'' was an enormous popular success, it was the subject of a heated argument over the norms of dramatic practice, known as the &quot;''Querelle du Cid''&quot; or &quot;The Quarrel of Le Cid&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Cardinal Richelieu's ''[[Académie française]]'' acknowledged the play's success, but determined that it was defective, in part because it did not respect the [[classical unities]] of time, place, and action (Unity of Time stipulated that all the action in a play must take place within a 24-hour time-frame; Unity of Place, that there must be only one setting for the action; and Unity of Action, that the plot must be centred on a single conflict or problem)</span>
				<span class='text'>The newly formed ''Académie'' was a body that asserted state control over cultural activity</span>
				<span class='text'>Although it usually dealt with efforts to standardize the [[French language]], Richelieu himself ordered an analysis of ''Le Cid''</span>
				<span class='text'>ccusations of immorality were leveled at the play in the form of a famous pamphlet campaign</span>
				<span class='text'>These attacks were founded on the classical theory that the theatre was a site of moral instruction</span>
				<span class='text'>The Académie's recommendations concerning the play are articulated in [[Jean Chapelain]]'s ''[[Sentiments de l'Académie française sur la tragi-comédie du Cid]]'' (1638)</span>
				<span class='text'>Even the prominent writer [[Georges de Scudéry]] harshly criticized the play in his ''[[Observations sur le Cid]]'' (1637)</span>
				<span class='text'>The intensity of this &quot;war of pamphlets&quot; was heightened severely by Corneille's boastful poem Excuse À Ariste, in which he rambled and boasted about his talents, while Corneille claimed no other author could be a rival</span>
				<span class='text'>These poems and pamphlets were made public, one after the other, as once &quot;esteemed&quot; playwrights traded slanderous blows</span>
				<span class='text'>At one point, Corneille took several shots at criticizing author Jean Mairet's family and lineage</span>
				<span class='text'>Scudéry, a close friend of Mariet at the time, did not stoop to Corneille's level of &quot;distastefulness&quot;, but instead continued to pillory Le Cid and its violations</span>
				<span class='text'>Scudéry even stated of Le Cid that, &quot;almost all of the beauty which the play contains is plagiarized</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;This &quot;war of pamphlets&quot; eventually influenced Richelieu to call upon the Académie française to analyze the play</span>
				<span class='text'>In their final conclusions, the Academy ruled that even though Corneille had attempted to remain loyal to the unity of time, &quot;Le Cid&quot; broke too many of the unities to be a valued piece of work</span>
				<span class='text'>he controversy, coupled with the Academy's ruling proved too much for Corneille, who decided to return to Rouen</span>
				<span class='text'>When one of his plays was reviewed unfavorably, Corneille was known to withdraw from public life</span>
				<span class='text'>He remained publicly silent for some time; privately, however, he was said to be &quot;troubled and obsessed by the issues, making numerous revisions to the play</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;===Response to the ''Querelle du Cid''===After a hiatus from the theater, Corneille returned in 1640</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''Querelle du Cid'' caused Corneille to pay closer attention to classical dramatic rules</span>
				<span class='text'>This was evident in his next plays, which were [[classical antiquity|classical]] [[tragedies]], ''[[Horace (play)|Horace]]'' (1640, dedicated to [[Cardinal Richelieu|Richelieu]]), ''[[Cinna (play)|Cinna]]'' (1643), and ''[[Polyeucte]]'' (1643)</span>
				<span class='text'>These three plays and ''Le Cid'' are collectively known as Corneille's &quot;Classical Tetralogy&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Corneille also responded to the criticisms of the Académie by making multiple revisions to ''Le Cid'' to make it closer to the conventions of classical tragedy</span>
				<span class='text'>The 1648, 1660, and 1682 editions were no longer subtitled &quot;[[tragicomedy]]&quot;, but &quot;tragedy&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Adrienne lecouvreur dans cornlie</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|[[Adrienne Lecouvreur]] as Cornelia in ''[[The Death of Pompey]]'']]Corneille’s popularity grew and by the mid 1640s, the first collection of his plays was published</span>
				<span class='text'>Corneille married Marie de Lampérière in 1641</span>
				<span class='text'>They had seven children together</span>
				<span class='text'>In the mid to late 1640s, Corneille produced mostly tragedies, ''[[La Mort de Pompée]]'' (''[[The Death of Pompey]]'', performed 1644), ''[[Rodogune]]'' (performed 1645), ''[[Théodore (Corneille)|Théodore]]'' (performed 1646), and ''[[Héraclius]]'' (performed 1647)</span>
				<span class='text'>He also wrote one comedy in this period, ''[[Le Menteur]]'' (''The Liar'', 1644)</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1652, the play ''[[Pertharite]]'' met with poor critical reviews and a disheartened Corneille decided to quit the theatre</span>
				<span class='text'>He began to focus on an influential verse translation of the ''[[Imitation of Christ]]'' by [[Thomas à Kempis]], which he completed in 1656</span>
				<span class='text'>After an absence of nearly eight years, Corneille was persuaded to return to the stage in 1659</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote the play ''[[Oedipe (Corneille)|Oedipe]]'', which was favored by [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In the next year, Corneille published ''[[Trois discours sur le poème dramatique]]'' (''[[Three Discourses on Dramatic Poetry]]''), which were, in part, defenses of his style</span>
				<span class='text'>These writings can be seen as Corneille’s response to the ''Querelle du Cid''</span>
				<span class='text'>He simultaneously maintained the importance of classical dramatic rules and justified his own transgressions of those rules in ''Le Cid''</span>
				<span class='text'>Corneille argued the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] dramatic guidelines were not meant to be subject to a strict literal reading</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, he suggested that they were open to interpretation</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the relevance of classical rules was maintained, Corneille suggested that the rules should not be so tyrannical that they stifle innovation</span>
				<span class='text'>==Later plays===Even though Corneille was prolific after his return to the stage, writing one play a year for the 14 years after 1659, his later plays did not have the same success as those of his earlier career</span>
				<span class='text'>Other writers were beginning to gain popularity</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1670 Corneille and [[Jean Racine]], one of his dramatic rivals, were challenged to write plays on the same incident</span>
				<span class='text'>Each playwright was unaware that the challenge had also been issued to the other</span>
				<span class='text'>When both plays were completed, it was generally acknowledged that Corneille’s ''[[Tite et Bérénice]]'' (1671) was inferior to Racine’s play (''[[Bérénice]]'')</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Molière]] was also prominent at the time and Corneille even composed the [[comedy]] ''[[Psyché (play)|Psyché]]'' (1671) in collaboration with him (and [[Philippe Quinault]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Most of the plays that Corneille wrote after his return to the stage were tragedies</span>
				<span class='text'>They included ''{{ill|fr|La Toison d'or (play){{!}}La Toison d'or|La Toison d'or}}'' (''The Golden Fleece'', 1660), ''[[Sertorius (Corneille)|Sertorius]]'' (1662), ''[[Othon (play)|Othon]]'' (1664), ''[[Agésilas]]'' (1666), and ''[[Attila (Corneille)|Attila]]'' (1667)</span>
				<span class='text'>orneille’s final play was the tragedy ''[[Suréna]]'' (1674)</span>
				<span class='text'>After this, he retired from the stage for the final time and died at his home in Paris in 1684</span>
				<span class='text'>His grave in the [[Église Saint-Roch]] went without a monument until 1821</span>
