				<span class='text'>Denmark did not have a tradition of allowing women to rule, so when her son died, she was titled &quot;All-powerful Lady and Mistress (Regent) of the Kingdom of Denmark&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Arild Huitfeldt|Huitfeldt, Arild]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Danmarks Riges Krønike) She only styled herself Queen of Denmark in 1375, usually referring to herself as &quot;Margaret, by the grace of God, daughter of Valdemar King of Denmark&quot; and &quot;Denmark's rightful heir&quot; when referring to her position in Denmark</span>
				<span class='text'>Others simply referred to her as the &quot;Lady Queen&quot;, without specifying what she was queen of, but not so [[Pope]] [[Boniface IX]], who in his letters styled her &quot;our beloved daughter in Christ, Margaret, most excellent queen of Denmark, Sweden and Norway&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>In Sweden, she was Dowager Queen and Plenipotentiary Ruler</span>
				<span class='text'>When she married [[Haakon VI of Norway]] in 1363, he was co-King of Sweden, making Margaret queen, and despite being deposed, they never relinquished the title</span>
				<span class='text'>In theory, the Swedes' expulsion of Albert I in 1389 simply restored Margaret to her original position</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; (March 1353&lt;ref name=&quot;colliers386&quot;/&gt; – 28 October 1412), was Queen of Denmark, Norway and Sweden and founder of the [[Kalmar Union]], which united the Scandinavian countries for over a century</span>
				<span class='text'>She acted as [[queen regnant]] of Denmark, although in those days it was not the Danish custom for a woman to reign</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schnith|first=Karl Rudolf|title=Frauen des Mittelalters in Lebensbildern|publisher=Styria|year=1997|page=396|isbn=3-222-12467-1|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her title in Denmark was derived from her father King [[Valdemar IV of Denmark]]</span>
				<span class='text'>She became Queen of Norway and Sweden by virtue of her marriage to King [[Haakon VI of Norway]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Biography=====Early years and marriage===Margaret was born in March 1353</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;colliers386&quot;/&gt; as the sixth and youngest child of [[Valdemar IV of Denmark]] and [[Helvig of Schleswig]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Etting|2009|p=12}} She was baptised in [[Roskilde]] and in 1359 as a six-year-old engaged to the 18-year-old King  [[Haakon VI of Norway]], who was youngest son of the Swedish-Norwegian king [[Magnus IV of Sweden|Magnus IV &amp; VII]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Etting|2009|p=12}} As part of the marriage contract it is presumed that a treaty was signed which meant that King Valdemar had to assist Magnus in a dispute with his second son, [[Eric XII of Sweden|Eric &quot;XII&quot; of Sweden]], who in 1356 was hailed as king there and had been given dominion over Southern Sweden</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Etting|2009|p=12}} Margaret's marriage was thus a part of the Nordic power struggle</span>
				<span class='text'>There was dissatisfaction with this in some circles, and the political activist [[Bridget of Sweden]] described the agreement in a letter to the Pope as &quot;children playing with dolls&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Etting|2009|p=12}} The goal of the marriage for King Valdemar was regaining [[Scania]], which since 1332 had been mortgaged to Sweden</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Etting|2009|p=13}} According to contemporary chronicles the marriage contract contained an agreement to give [[Kärnan|Helsingborg Castle]] back to Denmark, but that was not enough for Valdemar who in June 1359 attacked with a large army across [[Øresund]] and soon had occupied Scania</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Etting|2009|p=13}} The attack was ostensibly to support Magnus against Erik, but in June 1359 Erik died, which meant that the balance of power changed and all agreements between Magnus and Valdemar were terminated, including the marriage contract between Margaret and Haakon</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Etting|2009|p=13}}This did not get Valdemar to withdraw from Scania, but instead continued his conquests on the island of [[Gotland]] in the [[Baltic Sea]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Etting|2009|p=13}} [[Visby]], which was populated by Germans, was the main town on the island and was the key to domination of the Baltic Sea</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Etting|2009|p=13}} On 27 July 1361 a battle was fought between a well-equipped Danish army and an array of local Gotland peasants</span>
				<span class='text'>The Germans did not participate in the battle, which the Danes won, after which they took Visby</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Etting|2009|p=13}} King Magnus and the [[Hanseatic League]] could not disregard this provocation and a trade embargo against Denmark was immediately started and agreement reached about military action</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Etting|2009|p=15}} At the same time negotiations were opened between King Magnus and [[Henry II, Count of Holstein-Rendsburg|Henry of Holstein]] about a marriage between Haakon and the latter's sister Elizabeth</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Etting|2009|p=15}} On 17 December 1362 a ship left with Elizabeth, bound for Sweden</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Etting|2009|p=15}} A storm, however, saw that she ended up on the Danish island [[Bornholm]], from where Elisabeth was taken to the [[archbishop of Lund]], who declared that the wedding was a violation of church law because Haakon had already been engaged to Margaret</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Etting|2009|p=15}} The Swedish and Hanseatic armies did not have much more success and they ended up withdrawing from their siege of [[Helsingborg]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Etting|2009|p=15}} After this a truce was concluded with the Hanseatic States and King Magnus abandoned the war</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Etting|2009|p=16}} This meant that the marriage of the now 10-year-old Margaret and King Haakon was again relevant</span>
				<span class='text'>The wedding was held in Copenhagen on 9 April 1363</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Etting|2009|p=16}}The marriage of Haakon and Margaret should be seen as an alliance, and Margaret probably remained in Denmark for a while after the wedding,{{sfn|Etting|2009|p=16}} but before long she was taken to Akershus in Oslo Fjord, where she was raised by [[Märta Ulfsdotter|Merete Ulvsdatter]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Etting|2009|p=17}} Merete Ulvsdatter was a distinguished noblewoman and a daughter of [[Bridget of Sweden]], as well as the wife of Knut Algotsson, who was one of King Magnus's faithful followers</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Etting|2009|p=17}} According to a chronicle Margaret was brought up with Merete Ulvsdatter's daughter [[Ingegerd Knutsdotter|Ingegerd]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Etting|2009|p=17}} That upbringing probably emphasized religion and things Margaret should know as a woman and a queen</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Etting|2009|p=17}} Her academic studies were probably limited, but it is assumed that in addition to reading and writing she also was taught the general political situation</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Etting|2009|p=17}}In the years after Margaret's wedding Scandinavia saw a series of major political upheavals</span>
				<span class='text'>A few months after her wedding her only brother, [[Christopher, Duke of Lolland]], died</span>
				<span class='text'>This meant that Denmark was without an heir to the throne and her father without a male heir</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Etting|2009|p=19}} In 1364 the Swedish nobles deposed Magnus Smek and Margaret's husband King Haakon from the Swedish throne and elected [[Albert, King of Sweden|Albert of Mecklenburg]] as king of Sweden</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Etting|2009|p=17}}===Regent===Her first act after her father's death in 1375 was to procure the election of her infant son [[Olaf IV of Norway|Olaf]] as king of Denmark, despite the claims of her elder sister's [[Ingeborg of Denmark, Duchess of Mecklenburg|Ingeborg]]'s husband [[Henry III, Duke of Mecklenburg|Duke Henry III of Mecklenburg]] and their son [[Albert IV, Duke of Mecklenburg|Albert]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Margaret insisted that Olaf be proclaimed rightful heir of Sweden, among his other titles</span>
				<span class='text'>He was too young to rule in his own right, and Margaret proved herself a competent and shrewd ruler in the years that followed</span>
				<span class='text'> On the death of Haakon in 1380, Olaf succeeded him as King of Norway</span>
				<span class='text'>Olaf died suddenly in 1387, aged 17, and Margaret, who had ruled both kingdoms in his name, was chosen Regent of Norway and Denmark in the following year</span>
				<span class='text'>She had already proven her keen statesmanship by recovering possession of [[Schleswig]] from the [[Holstein]]-Rendsburg Counts</span>
				<span class='text'>The Counts had held it for more than a generation and received it back as a fief by the Compact of Nyborg in 1386,{{Clarify|date=March 2012|post-text=(of chronology)}} but under such stringent conditions that the Danish Crown received all the advantages of the arrangement</span>
				<span class='text'>By this compact, the often rebellious [[Jutes|Jutish]] nobility lost the support they had previously enjoyed in Schleswig and Holstein</span>
				<span class='text'>Margaret, free from fear of domestic sedition, could now give her undivided attention to [[Sweden]], where mutinous nobles were already in arms against their unpopular King [[Albert of Sweden|Albert]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Several of the powerful nobles wrote to Margaret that if she would help rid Sweden of Albert, she would become their regent</span>
				<span class='text'>She quickly gathered an army and invaded Sweden</span>
				<span class='text'>t a conference held at [[Dalaborg]] Castle in March 1388, the Swedes were compelled to accept all of Margaret's conditions, elected her &quot;Sovereign Lady and Ruler&quot;, and committed themselves to accept any king she chose to appoint</span>
				<span class='text'>On 24 February 1389 Albert, who had called her &quot;King Pantsless&quot; and had returned from Mecklenburg with an army of mercenaries, was routed and taken prisoner at Aasle near [[Falköping]], and Margaret was now the omnipotent mistress of three kingdoms</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Margaret the Great of Scandinavia statue at Roskilde 2009 (2) crop 1</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Queen Margaret the Great on horseback, statue in central [[Roskilde]] by [[Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen]]</span>
				<span class='text'>][[Stockholm]], then almost entirely a German city, still held out</span>
				<span class='text'> Fear of Margaret induced both the Mecklenburg princes and the [[Wends|Wendish]] towns to hasten to its assistance; and the Baltic and the North Sea speedily swarmed with the privateers of the [[Victual Brothers]]</span>
				<span class='text'> The [[Hanseatic League]] intervened, and under the Compact of Lindholm (1395), Margaret released Albert on his promise to pay 60,000 marks within three years</span>
				<span class='text'>Meanwhile, the Hansa were to hold Stockholm as surety</span>
				<span class='text'>Albert failed to pay his ransom within the stipulated time, and the Hansa surrendered Stockholm to Margaret in September 1398 in exchange for commercial privileges</span>
				<span class='text'>=Eric of Pomerania==It had been understood that Margaret should, at the first convenient opportunity, provide the three kingdoms with a king who was to be a kinsman of all the three old dynasties, although in Norway it was specified that she would continue ruling alongside the new king</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1389 she proclaimed her great-nephew, [[Eric of Pomerania]] (grandson of Henry of Mecklenburg), king of Norway, having adopted him and his sister [[Catherine of Pomerania-Stolp|Catherine]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1396, homage was rendered to him in Denmark and Sweden, while Margaret once again assumed the regency during his minority</span>
				<span class='text'>To weld the united kingdoms still more closely together, Margaret summoned a congress of the three [[Rigsraadet|Councils of the Realm]] to [[Kalmar]] in June 1397, and on [[Trinity Sunday]], 17 June, Eric was crowned King of Denmark, Norway and Sweden</span>
				<span class='text'>The proposed Act of Union divided the three Councils, and the actual deed embodying its terms never got further than an unratified draft</span>
				<span class='text'>Margaret balked at the clauses which insisted that each country should retain exclusive possession of its own laws and customs and be administered by its own dignitaries, because in her opinion this prevented the complete amalgamation of [[Scandinavia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>With her usual prudence, however, she avoided every appearance of an open rupture</span>
				<span class='text'> few years after the [[Kalmar Union]], the 18-year-old Eric was declared of age and homage was rendered to him in all his three kingdoms, although Margaret was the effective ruler of Scandinavia throughout her lifetime</span>
				<span class='text'>=Policy==[[File:Roskilde Margrethe1 grave</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|300px|left|The tomb of Margaret I in [[Roskilde Cathedral]]</span>
				<span class='text'>]So long as the union was insecure, Margaret had tolerated the presence of the [[Riksråd]], but their influence was minor and the Royal authority remained supreme</span>
				<span class='text'>The offices of High Constable and Earl Marshal were left vacant; the [[Danehof]] fell into ruin, and the great Queen, an ideal despot,{{Clarify|date=March 2012}} &lt;!-- is this a term with some special meaning, or just puffery? --&gt; ruled through her court officials, who served as a superior kind of clerk</span>
				<span class='text'>In any event, law and order were well maintained and the licence of the nobility was sternly repressed</span>
				<span class='text'>The Kingdoms of Sweden and Norway were treated as integral parts of the Danish State, and national aspirations were frowned upon or checked, though Norway, being more loyal, was treated more indulgently than Sweden</span>
				<span class='text'>argaret recovered for the Crown all the landed property that had been alienated in the troubled times before the reign of Valdemar IV</span>
				<span class='text'>This so-called ''reduktion'', or land-recovery, was carried out with the utmost rigour, and hundreds of estates fell into the hands of the crown</span>
				<span class='text'>She also reformed the Danish currency, substituting good silver coins for the old and worthless copper tokens, to the great advantage both of herself and of the state</span>
				<span class='text'>She always had large sums of money at her disposal, and much of it was given to charity</span>
				<span class='text'>n contrast with the foreign policy of her venturesome father, Margaret's was circumspect and unswervingly neutral</span>
				<span class='text'>However, she spared no pains to recover lost Danish territory</span>
				<span class='text'>She purchased the island of [[Gotland]] from its actual possessors, [[Albert, King of Sweden|Albert of Mecklenburg]] and the [[Livonian Order]], and the greater part of Schleswig was regained in the same way</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1402 Margaret entered into negotiations with King [[Henry IV of England]] about the possibility of a double-wedding alliance between [[England]] and the Nordic Union</span>
				<span class='text'>The proposal was for King Eric to marry Henry's daughter [[Philippa of England|Philippa]], and for Henry's son, the Prince of Wales and future [[Henry V of England]], to marry Eric's sister Catherine</span>
				<span class='text'>The English side wanted these weddings to seal an offensive alliance that could have led the Nordic kingdoms to become involved in the [[Hundred Years' War]] against [[France]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Margaret followed a consistent policy of not becoming involved in binding alliances and foreign wars, and therefore rejected the English proposals</span>
				<span class='text'>However, although there was no double wedding, Eric married the 13-year-old Philippa, daughter of Henry IV of England and [[Mary de Bohun]], at [[Lund]] on 26 October 1406, sealing a purely defensive alliance</span>
				<span class='text'>For Eric's sister Catherine, a wedding was arranged with [[John, Count Palatine of Neumarkt]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Margaret thus acquired a South German ally, who could be useful as a counterweight to the North German Princes and cities</span>
