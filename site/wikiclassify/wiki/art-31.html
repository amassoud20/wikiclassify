				<span class='text'>name Gerli The Portuguese nobility disliked the alliance between Galicia and Portugal and rallied around the infant Afonso</span>
				<span class='text'> The Archbishop of Braga was also concerned with the dominance of Galicia apprehensive of the ecclesiastical pretensions of his new rival the Galician Archbishop of Santiago de Compostela Diego Gelmírez who had claimed an alleged discovery of relics of Saint James in his town as a way to gain power and riches over the other cathedrals in the Iberian Peninsula</span>

				<span class='text'>The first assembly of the estates general convened at  wherein he would have been given the crown from the Archbishop of Braga to confirm his independence is a 17th century embellishment of Portuguese history</span>

				<span class='text'>Conflict between the two was constant and bitter in the following years</span>
				<span class='text'>Afonso became involved in a war taking the side of the Aragonese king an enemy of Castile</span>
