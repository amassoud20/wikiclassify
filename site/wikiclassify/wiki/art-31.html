				<span class='text'>Afonso Henriques''' ({{IPA-pt|ɐˈfõsu ẽˈʁikɨʃ}}), nicknamed &quot;the Conqueror&quot; ({{lang-pt|O Conquistador}}), &quot;the Founder&quot; ({{lang|pt|''O Fundador''}}) or &quot;the Great&quot; ({{lang|pt|''O Grande''}}) by the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], and  ''El-Bortukali'' [in Arabic البرتغال] (&quot;the Portuguese&quot;) and ''Ibn-Arrik'' [in Arabic ابن الرَّنك or ابن الرَنْق] (&quot;son of Henry&quot;, &quot;Henriques&quot;) by the [[Moors]] whom he fought, was the first [[List of Portuguese monarchs|King of Portugal]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He achieved the independence of the southern part of the [[Kingdom of Galicia]], the County of Portugal, from Galicia's overlord, the [[Kingdom of León|King of León]], in 1139, establishing a new kingdom and doubling its area with the ''[[Reconquista]]'', an objective that he pursued until his death, in 1185, after forty-six years of wars against the Moors</span>
				<span class='text'>=Mother's rule==Afonso I was the son of [[Henry, Count of Portugal|Henry of Burgundy]] and [[Theresa, Countess of Portugal|Theresa]], the natural daughter of King [[Alfonso VI of León and Castile]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The pair reigned jointly as Count and Countess of Portugal until Henry's death, after which Theresa reigned alone</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Lisbon: Temas e Debates</span>
				<span class='text'>ISBN 978-972-759-911-0&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to pursue a larger share in the Leonese inheritance, his mother Theresa married Fernando Pérez, Count of Trava, the most powerful count in Galicia</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Gerli/&gt;The Portuguese nobility disliked the alliance between Galicia and Portugal and rallied around the infant Afonso</span>
				<span class='text'> The Archbishop of Braga was also concerned with the dominance of Galicia, apprehensive of the ecclesiastical pretensions of his new rival the Galician Archbishop of Santiago de Compostela, Diego Gelmírez, who had claimed an alleged discovery of relics of Saint James in his town, as a way to gain power and riches over the other cathedrals in the Iberian Peninsula</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1122, Afonso turned fourteen, the adult age in the 12th century</span>
				<span class='text'>He made himself a [[knight]] on his own account in the [[Cathedral of Zamora]], raised an army, and proceeded to take control of his mother's lands</span>
				<span class='text'>= Sole count ==In 1128, near [[Guimarães]], at the [[Battle of São Mamede]] Afonso and his supporters overcame troops under his stepfather Count [[Fernando Peres de Trava]] of [[Kingdom of Galicia|Galicia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Afonso exiled his mother to Galicia, and took over rule of the County of Portugal</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Gerli/&gt; Thus the possibility of re-incorporating Portugal (up to then known as Southern Galicia) into a Kingdom of Portugal and Galicia as before was eliminated and Afonso became sole ruler following demands for independence from the county's church and nobles</span>
				<span class='text'>He also vanquished his mother's nephew, [[Alfonso VII of León]], who came to her rescue, and thus freed the country from political dependence on the crown of his cousin of León</span>
				<span class='text'>On 6 April 1129, Afonso Henriques dictated the writ in which he proclaimed himself Prince of Portugal</span>
				<span class='text'>fonso then turned his arms against the persistent problem of the Moors in the south</span>
				<span class='text'>His campaigns were successful and, on 25 July 1139, he obtained an overwhelming victory in the [[Battle of Ourique]], and straight after was unanimously proclaimed King of the Portuguese by his soldiers, establishing his equality in rank to the other realms of the Peninsula</span>
				<span class='text'>The first assembly of the estates-general convened at [[Lamego]] (wherein he would have been given the crown from the Archbishop of Braga, to confirm his independence) is a 17th-century embellishment of Portuguese history</span>
				<span class='text'>= Kingship ==Independence from Alfonso VII of León's [[suzerainty]], however, was not a thing he just could achieve militarily</span>
				<span class='text'>The County of Portugal still had to be acknowledged diplomatically by the neighboring lands as a kingdom and, most importantly, by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Pope]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Afonso wed [[Mafalda of Savoy, Queen of Portugal|Mafalda of Savoy]], daughter of [[Amadeus III, Count of Savoy]], and sent ambassadors to Rome to negotiate with the Pope</span>
				<span class='text'>He succeeded in renouncing the suzerainty of his cousin, Alfonso VII of León, becoming instead a vassal of the papacy, as the kings of Sicily and Aragon had done before him</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1179 the bull ''[[Manifestis Probatum]]'' accepted the new king as vassal to the pope exclusively</span>
				<span class='text'>[Image:Siege of Lisbon - Muslim surrender</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|300px|King Afonso I at the [[Siege of Lisbon]]</span>
				<span class='text'>]In Portugal he built several monasteries and convents and bestowed important privileges to religious orders</span>
				<span class='text'>He is notably the builder of [[Alcobaça Monastery]], to which he called the [[Cistercians|Cistercian Order]] of his uncle [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] of [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1143, he wrote to [[Pope Innocent II]] to declare himself and the kingdom servants of the church, swearing to pursue driving the Moors out of the Iberian Peninsula</span>
				<span class='text'>Bypassing any king of León, Afonso declared himself the direct [[wikt:liege|liege man]] of the papacy</span>
				<span class='text'>Afonso continued to distinguish himself by his exploits against the Moors, from whom he wrested [[Santarém, Portugal|Santarém]] (see [[Conquest of Santarém]]) and [[Lisbon]] in 1147 (see [[Siege of Lisbon]])</span>
				<span class='text'>He also conquered an important part of the land south of the [[Tagus]] River, although this was lost again to the Moors in the following years</span>
				<span class='text'>eanwhile, King Alfonso VII of León (Afonso's cousin) regarded the independent ruler of Portugal as nothing but a rebel</span>
				<span class='text'>Conflict between the two was constant and bitter in the following years</span>
				<span class='text'>Afonso became involved in a war, taking the side of the Aragonese king, an enemy of Castile</span>
				<span class='text'>To ensure the alliance, his son [[Sancho I of Portugal|Sancho]] was engaged to [[Dulce of Aragon|Dulce]], sister of the [[Count of Barcelona]] and Infanta of Aragon</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally after winning the [[Battle of Valdevez]], the [[Treaty of Zamora (1143)]] established peace between the cousins and the recognition by the Kingdom of León that Portugal was a sovereign kingdom</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1169 the now old Dom Afonso was disabled in an engagement near [[Badajoz]] by a fall from his horse, and made prisoner by the soldiers of the king of León Ferdinand II also his son-in-law</span>
				<span class='text'>Portugal was obliged to surrender as his ransom almost all the conquests Afonso had made in Galicia (north of the [[Minho River]]) in the previous years</span>
				<span class='text'>[Image:BatalhaOurique</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|300px|Afonso at the [[Battle of Ourique]]</span>
				<span class='text'>]In 1179 the privileges and favours given to the Roman Catholic Church were compensated</span>
				<span class='text'>In the [[papal bull]] '' [[Manifestis Probatum]]'', [[Pope Alexander III]] acknowledged Afonso as king and Portugal as an independent crown with the right to conquer lands from the Moors</span>
				<span class='text'>With this papal blessing, Portugal was at last secured as a kingdom</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1184, in spite of his great age, he still had sufficient energy to relieve his son Sancho, who was besieged in [[Siege of Santarém (1184)|Santarém]] by the Moors</span>
				<span class='text'>Afonso died shortly after, on 6 December 1185</span>
				<span class='text'>The Portuguese revere him as a hero, both on account of his personal character and as the founder of their nation</span>
				<span class='text'>There are mythical stories that it took 10 men to carry his sword, and that Afonso wanted to engage other monarchs in personal combat, but no one would dare accept his challenge</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|Tomb of Afonso Henriques in the [[Monastery of Santa Cruz (Coimbra)|Santa Cruz Monastery]] in [[Coimbra]]</span>
				<span class='text'>]In July 2006, the tomb of the king (which is located in the [[Monastery of Santa Cruz (Coimbra)|Santa Cruz Monastery]] in [[Coimbra]]) was to be opened for scientific purposes by researchers from the [[University of Coimbra]] (Portugal) and the [[University of Granada]] (Spain)</span>
				<span class='text'>The opening of the tomb provoked considerable concern among some sectors of Portuguese society and [[IPPAR]] – ''Instituto Português do Património Arquitectónico'' (Portuguese State Agency for Architectural Patrimony)</span>
				<span class='text'>The government halted the opening, requesting more protocols from the scientific team because of the importance of the king in the nation's formation</span>
