				<span class='text'>Following the victory of [[Han dynasty|Han]] over [[Chu-Han Contention|Chu]] after the collapse of Qin, Confucius's thoughts received official sanction and were further developed into a system known as [[Confucianism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>onfucius is traditionally credited with having authored or edited many of the [[Chinese classic texts]] including all of the [[Five Classics]], but modern scholars are cautious of attributing specific assertions to Confucius himself</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Aphorism]]s concerning his teachings were compiled in the ''[[Analects of Confucius|Analects]]'', but only many years after his death</span>
				<span class='text'>onfucius's principles had a basis in common Chinese tradition and belief</span>
				<span class='text'>He championed strong family loyalty, [[Veneration of the dead|ancestor worship]], respect of elders by their children and of husbands by their wives</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=274–275}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Under the duke were [[Three Huan|three aristocratic families]], whose heads bore the title of viscount and held hereditary positions in the Lu bureaucracy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=dubs49-275 /&gt; The Ji family held the position &quot;Minister over the Masses&quot;, who was also the &quot;Prime Minister&quot;; the Meng family held the position &quot;Minister of Works&quot;; and the Shu family held the position &quot;Minister of War&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=dubs49-275 /&gt; In the winter of 505 BC, Yang Hu—a retainer of the Ji family—rose up in rebellion and seized power from the Ji family</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=dubs49-275&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=275}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; However, by the summer of 501 BC, the three hereditary families had succeeded in expelling Yang Hu from Lu</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=dubs49-275 /&gt; By then, Confucius had built up a considerable reputation through his teachings, while the families came to see the value of proper conduct and righteousness, so they could achieve loyalty to a legitimate government</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=dubs49-275-6&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=275–276}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Thus, that year (501 BC), Confucius came to be appointed to the minor position of governor of a town</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=dubs49-275-6 /&gt; Eventually, he rose to the position of Minister of Crime</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=dubs49-275-6 /&gt;Confucius desired to return the authority of the state to the duke by dismantling the fortifications of the city-strongholds belonging to the three families</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=dubs49-277 /&gt; This way, he could establish a centralized government</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=dubs49-277 /&gt; However, Confucius relied solely on diplomacy as he had no military authority himself</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=dubs49-277 /&gt; In 500 BC, Hou Fan—the governor of Hou—revolted against his lord of the Shu family</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=dubs49-277&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=277}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Although the Meng and Shu families unsuccessfully besieged Hou, a loyalist official rose up with the people of Hou and forced Hou Fan to flee to the [[Qi (state)|Qi state]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=dubs49-277 /&gt; The situation may have been in favor for Confucius as this likely made it possible for Confucius and his disciples to convince the aristocratic families to dismantle the fortifications of their cities</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=dubs49-277 /&gt; Eventually, after a year and a half, Confucius and his disciples succeeded in convincing the Shu family to raze the walls of Hou, the Ji family in razing the walls of Bi, and the Meng family in razing the walls of Cheng</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=dubs49-277 /&gt; First, the Shu family led an army towards their city Hou and tore down its walls in 498 BC</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=dubs49-277 /&gt; Soon thereafter, Gongshan Furao{{Efn|Gongshan Furao is also known as Gongshan Buniu</span>
				<span class='text'>}—a retainer of the Ji family—revolted and took control of the forces at Bi</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=creel49-35-6&gt;{{Harvnb|Creel|1949|loc=35–36}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=duuuu46-277-8 /&gt; He immediately launched an attack and entered the capital Lu</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=dubs49-277 /&gt;Earlier, Gongshan had approached Confucius to join him, which Confucius considered</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=creel49-35-6 /&gt; Even though he disapproved the use of a violent revolution, the Ji family dominated the Lu state force for generations and had exiled the previous duke</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=creel49-35-6 /&gt; Although he wanted the opportunity to put his principles in practice, Confucius gave up on this idea in the end</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=creel49-35-6 /&gt; Creel (1949) states that, unlike the rebel Yang Hu before him, Gongshan may have sought to destroy the three hereditary families and restore the power of the duke</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=creel49-35&gt;{{Harvnb|Creel|1949|loc=35}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; However, Dubs (1946) is of the view that Gongshan was encouraged by Viscount Ji Huan to invade the Lu capital in an attempt to avoid dismantling the Bi fortified walls</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=duuuu46-277-8&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=277–278}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Whatever the situation may have been, Gongshan was considered an upright man who continued to defend the state of Lu, even after he was forced to flee</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=creel49-35 /&gt;&lt;ref name=dubs49-278 /&gt;During the revolt by Gongshan, Zhong You (仲由) had managed to keep the duke and the three viscounts together at the court</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=dubs49-278&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=278}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Zhong You was one of the disciples of Confucius and Confucius had arranged for him to be given the position of governor by the Ji family</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=278–279}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; When Confucius heard of the raid, he requested that Viscount Ji Huan allow the duke and his court to retreat to a stronghold on his palace grounds</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=dubs49-279&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=279}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, the heads of the three families and the duke retreated to the Ji's palace complex and ascended the Wuzi Terrace</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=chin07-30&gt;{{Harvnb|Chin|2007|loc=30}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Confucius ordered two officers to lead an assault against the rebels</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=chin07-30 /&gt; At least one of the two officers was a retainer of the Ji family, but they were unable to refuse the orders while in the presence of the duke, viscounts, and court</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=dubs49-279 /&gt; The rebels were pursued and defeated at Gu</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=chin07-30 /&gt; Immediately after the revolt was defeated, the Ji family razed the Bi city walls to the ground</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=chin07-30 /&gt;The attackers retreated after realizing that they would have to become rebels against the state and against their own lord</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=dubs49-279 /&gt; Through Confucius' actions, the Bi officials had inadvertently revolted against their own lord, thus forcing Viscount Ji Huan's hand in having to dismantle the walls of Bi (as it could have harbored such rebels) or confess to instigating the event by going against proper conduct and righteousness as an official</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=dubs49-279 /&gt; Dubs (1949) suggests that the incident brought to light Confucius' foresight, practical political ability and his insight into human character</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=dubs49-279 /&gt;When it was time to dismantle the city walls of the Meng family, the governor was reluctant to have his city walls torn down and convinced the head of the Meng family not to do so</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=chin07-30 /&gt; The ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]'' recalls that the governor advised against razing the walls to the ground as he said that it made Cheng vulnerable to the [[Qi (state)|Qi state]] and cause the destruction of the Meng family</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;dubs49-279&quot; /&gt; Even though Viscount Meng Yi gave his word not to interfere with an attempt, he went back on his earlier promise to dismantle the walls</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;dubs49-279&quot; /&gt;Later in 498 BC, Duke Ding personally went with an army to lay siege to Cheng in an attempt to raze its walls to the ground, but he did not succeed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=280}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Confucius could not achieve the idealistic reforms that he wanted including restoration of the legitimate rule of the duke</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=280–281}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He had made powerful enemies within the state, especially with Viscount Ji Huan, due to his successes so far</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=dubs46-281&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=281}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; According to accounts in the ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]'' and ''[[Shiji]]'', Confucius departed his homeland in 497 BC after his support for the failed attempt of dismantling the fortified city walls of the powerful Ji, Meng, and Shu families</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Riegel|1986|loc=13}}</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|The [[Analects]] of Confucius]]In the ''[[Analects]]'', Confucius presents himself as a &quot;transmitter who invented nothing&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He puts the greatest emphasis on the importance of study, and it is the [[Chinese character]] for study ({{linktext|學}}) that opens the text</span>
				<span class='text'>Far from trying to build a systematic or [[Religious formalism|formalist]] theory, he wanted his disciples to master and internalize the old classics, so that their deep thought and thorough study would allow them to relate the moral problems of the present to past political events (as recorded in the ''Annals'') or the past expressions of commoners' feelings and noblemen's reflections (as in the poems of the ''[[Shi Jing|Book of Odes]]'')</span>
				<span class='text'>==Ethics===One of the deepest teachings of Confucius may have been the superiority of personal exemplification over explicit rules of behavior</span>
				<span class='text'>His moral teachings emphasized self-cultivation, emulation of moral exemplars, and the attainment of skilled judgment rather than knowledge of rules</span>
				<span class='text'>Confucian ethics may be considered a type of [[virtue ethics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His teachings rarely rely on reasoned argument and ethical ideals and methods are conveyed more indirectly, through [[allusion]], [[innuendo]], and even [[tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His teachings require examination and context in order to be understood</span>
				<span class='text'>A good example is found in this famous anecdote:::{{lang|zh|廄焚。子退朝，曰：“傷人乎？” 不問馬。}}::''When the stables were burnt down, on returning from court Confucius said, &quot;Was anyone hurt?&quot; He did not ask about the horses</span>

				<span class='text'>[[D</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Lau|Lau]])By not asking about the horses, Confucius demonstrates that the sage values human beings over property; readers are led to reflect on whether their response would follow Confucius' and to pursue self-improvement if it would not have</span>
				<span class='text'>Confucius, as an exemplar of human excellence, serves as the ultimate model, rather than a deity or a universally true set of abstract principles</span>
				<span class='text'>For these reasons, according to many commentators, Confucius' teachings may be considered a Chinese example of [[humanism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ne of his teachings was a variant of the [[Golden Rule]] sometimes called the &quot;[[Silver Rule]]&quot; owing to its negative form:::{{lang|zh|己所不欲，勿施於人。}}::''&quot;What you do not wish for yourself, do not do to others</span>

Never impose on others what you would not choose for yourself</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;'':::::::''Analects'' XV</span>
				<span class='text'>4, tr</span>
				<span class='text'>David HintonOften overlooked in Confucian ethics are the virtues to the self: sincerity and the cultivation of knowledge</span>
				<span class='text'>Virtuous action towards others begins with virtuous and sincere thought, which begins with knowledge</span>
				<span class='text'> A virtuous disposition without knowledge is susceptible to corruption and virtuous action without sincerity is not true righteousness</span>
				<span class='text'>Cultivating knowledge and sincerity is also important for one's own sake; the superior person loves learning for the sake of learning and righteousness for the sake of righteousness</span>
				<span class='text'>he Confucian theory of ethics as exemplified in ''[[Li (Confucian)|Lǐ]]'' ({{lang|zh|禮}}) is based on three important conceptual aspects of life: (a) ceremonies associated with sacrifice to ancestors and deities of various types, (b) social and political institutions, and (c) the etiquette of daily behavior</span>
				<span class='text'>It was believed by some that ''lǐ'' originated from the heavens, but Confucius stressed the development of ''lǐ'' through the actions of sage leaders in human history</span>
				<span class='text'>His discussions of ''lǐ'' seem to redefine the term to refer to all actions committed by a person to build the ideal society, rather than those simply conforming with canonical standards of ceremony</span>
				<span class='text'>n the early Confucian tradition, ''lǐ'' was doing the proper thing at the proper time, balancing between maintaining existing norms to perpetuate an ethical social fabric, and violating them in order to accomplish ethical good</span>
				<span class='text'>Training in the ''lǐ'' of past sages cultivates in people virtues that include ethical judgment about when ''lǐ'' must be adapted in light of situational contexts</span>
				<span class='text'>n Confucianism, the concept of ''li'' is closely related to ''yì'' ({{lang|zh|義}}), which is based upon the idea of reciprocity</span>
				<span class='text'>''Yì'' can be translated as [[righteousness]], though it may simply mean what is ethically best to do in a certain context</span>
				<span class='text'>The term contrasts with action done out of [[selfishness|self-interest]]</span>
				<span class='text'>While pursuing one's own self-interest is not necessarily bad, one would be a better, more righteous person if one's life was based upon following a path designed to enhance the greater good</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus an outcome of ''yì'' is doing the right thing for the right reason</span>
				<span class='text'>ust as action according to ''[[Li (Confucian)|Lǐ]]'' should be adapted to conform to the aspiration of adhering to ''yì'', so ''yì'' is linked to the core value of ''rén'' ({{lang|zh|仁}})</span>
				<span class='text'>'[[Ren (Confucianism)|Rén]]'' consists of 5 basic virtues: seriousness, generosity, sincerity, diligence and kindness</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bonevac09-40&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bonevac|Phillips|2009|loc=40}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; ''Rén'' is the virtue of perfectly fulfilling one's responsibilities toward others, most often translated as &quot;benevolence&quot; or &quot;humaneness&quot;; translator [[Arthur Waley]] calls it &quot;Goodness&quot; (with a capital ''G''), and other translations that have been put forth include &quot;authoritativeness&quot; and &quot;selflessness</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Confucius' moral system was based upon [[empathy]] and understanding others, rather than divinely ordained rules</span>
				<span class='text'>To develop one's spontaneous responses of ''rén'' so that these could guide action intuitively was even better than living by the rules of ''yì''</span>
				<span class='text'>Confucius asserts that virtue is a means between extremes</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, the properly generous person gives the right amount—not too much and not too little</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bonevac09-40&quot; /&gt;===Politics===Confucius' political thought is based upon his ethical thought</span>
				<span class='text'>He argued that the best government is one that rules through &quot;rites&quot; (''lǐ'') and people's [[natural morality]], and ''not'' by using bribery and coercion</span>
				<span class='text'>He explained that this is one of the most important analects: &quot;If the people be led by laws, and uniformity sought to be given them by punishments, they will try to avoid the punishment, but have no sense of shame</span>
				<span class='text'>If they be led by virtue, and uniformity sought to be given them by the rules of propriety, they will have the sense of the shame, and moreover will become good</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; (Translated by [[James Legge]]) in the [[Great Learning]] ({{lang|zh|大學}})</span>
				<span class='text'>This &quot;sense of shame&quot; is an internalisation of [[duty]], where the punishment precedes the evil action, instead of following it in the form of laws as in [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>onfucius looked nostalgically upon earlier days, and urged the Chinese, particularly those with political power, to model themselves on earlier examples</span>
				<span class='text'>In times of division, chaos, and endless wars between feudal states, he wanted to restore the [[Mandate of Heaven]] ({{lang|zh|天命}}) that could unify the &quot;world&quot; ({{lang|zh|天下}}, &quot;all under Heaven&quot;) and bestow peace and prosperity on the people</span>
				<span class='text'>Because his vision of personal and social perfections was framed as a revival of the ordered society of earlier times, Confucius is often considered a great proponent of [[conservatism]], but a closer look at what he proposes often shows that he used (and perhaps twisted) past institutions and rites to push a new political agenda of his own: a revival of a unified royal state, whose rulers would succeed to power on the basis of their moral merits instead of lineage</span>
				<span class='text'>These would be rulers devoted to their people, striving for personal and social [[perfection]], and such a ruler would spread his own virtues to the people instead of imposing proper behavior with laws and rules</span>
				<span class='text'>onfucius did not believe in the concept of &quot;[[democracy]]&quot;, which is itself an [[Athens|Athenian]] concept unknown in ancient China, but could be interpreted by Confucius' principles recommending against individuals electing their own political leaders to govern them, or that anyone is capable of self-government</span>
				<span class='text'>He expressed fears that the masses lacked the intellect to make decisions for themselves, and that, in his view, since not everyone is created equal, not everyone has a right of self-government</span>

				<span class='text'>He argued for representing [[truth]] in language, and [[honesty]] was of paramount importance</span>
				<span class='text'>Even in [[facial expression]], truth must always be represented</span>
				<span class='text'>Confucius believed that if a ruler were to lead correctly, by action, that orders would be deemed unnecessary in that others will follow the proper actions of their ruler</span>
				<span class='text'>In discussing the relationship between a king and his subject (or a father and his son), he underlined the need to give due respect to superiors</span>
				<span class='text'>This demanded that the subordinates must give advice to their superiors if the superiors were considered to be taking the course of action that was wrong</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Legacy==Confucius' teachings were later turned into an elaborate set of rules and practices by his numerous disciples and followers, who organized his teachings into the Analects</span>
				<span class='text'>Confucius' disciples and his only grandson, [[Zisi]], continued his philosophical school after his death</span>
				<span class='text'>These efforts spread Confucian ideals to students who then became officials in many of the royal courts in China, thereby giving Confucianism the first wide-scale test of its [[dogma]]</span>
				<span class='text'>wo of Confucius' most famous later followers emphasized radically different aspects of his teachings</span>
				<span class='text'>In the centuries after his death, [[Mencius]] ({{lang|zh|孟子}}) and [[Xun Zi]] ({{lang|zh|荀子}}) both composed important teachings elaborating in different ways on the fundamental ideas associated with Confucius</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Mencius]] (4th century BC) articulated the innate goodness in human beings as a source of the ethical intuitions that guide people towards ''rén'', ''yì'', and ''lǐ'', while [[Xun Zi]] (3rd century BC) underscored the realistic and materialistic aspects of Confucian thought, stressing that morality was inculcated in society through tradition and in individuals through training</span>
				<span class='text'>In time, their writings, together with the ''Analects'' and other core texts came to constitute the philosophical corpus of Confucianism</span>
				<span class='text'>his realignment in Confucian thought was parallel to the development of [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], which saw filial piety as self-interest and not a useful tool for a ruler to create an effective state</span>
				<span class='text'> A disagreement between these two political philosophies came to a head in 223 BC when the [[Qin (state)|Qin state]] conquered all of China</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Li Si]], Prime Minister of the [[Qin Dynasty]] convinced [[Qin Shi Huang]] to abandon the Confucians' recommendation of awarding fiefs akin to the [[Zhou Dynasty]] before them which he saw as being against to the Legalist idea of centralizing the state around the ruler</span>
				<span class='text'> When the Confucian advisers pressed their point, Li Si had many Confucian scholars killed and their books burned—considered a huge blow to the philosophy and Chinese scholarship</span>
				<span class='text'>nder the succeeding [[Han Dynasty]] and [[Tang dynasty]], Confucian ideas gained even more widespread prominence</span>
				<span class='text'> Under [[Emperor Wu of Han|Wudi]], the works of Confucius were made the official imperial philosophy and required reading for civil service examinations in 140 BC which was continued nearly unbroken until the end of the 19th Century</span>
				<span class='text'>As [[Moism]] lost support by the time of the Han,  the main philosophical contenders were Legalism, which Confucian thought somewhat absorbed, the teachings of [[Laozi]], whose focus on more spiritual ideas kept it from direct conflict with Confucianism, and the new [[Buddhist]] religion, which gained acceptance during the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] era</span>
				<span class='text'>Both Confucian ideas and Confucian-trained officials were relied upon in the [[Ming Dynasty]] and even the [[Yuan Dynasty]], although Kublai Khan distrusted handing over provincial control to them</span>
				<span class='text'>uring the [[Song dynasty]], the scholar [[Zhu Xi]] (AD 1130–1200) added ideas from [[Daoism]] and [[Buddhism]] into Confucianism</span>
				<span class='text'>In his life, Zhu Xi was largely ignored, but not long after his death his ideas became the new orthodox view of what Confucian texts actually meant</span>
				<span class='text'>Modern historians view Zhu Xi as having created something rather different, and call his way of thinking ''[[Neo-Confucianism]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>All such ceremonies and rites were therefore banned</span>
				<span class='text'>Only after the 1990s did the ceremony resume</span>
				<span class='text'>As it is now considered a veneration of Chinese history and tradition, even Communist Party members may be found in attendance</span>
				<span class='text'>n Taiwan, where the Nationalist Party ([[Kuomintang]]) strongly promoted Confucian beliefs in ethics and behavior, the tradition of the memorial ceremony of Confucius (祭孔) is supported by the government and has continued without interruption</span>
				<span class='text'>While not a national holiday, it does appear on all printed calendars, much as [[Father's Day]] does in the West</span>
				<span class='text'>==Descendants==={{See also|Family tree of Confucius in the main line of descent}}Confucius' descendants were repeatedly identified and honored by successive imperial governments with titles of nobility and official posts</span>

				<span class='text'>[[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang]] first bestowed the title of &quot;Duke Wenxuan&quot; on Kong Suizhi of the 35th generation</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1055, [[Emperor Renzong of Song]] first bestowed the title of &quot;[[Duke Yansheng]]&quot; on Kong Zongyuan of the 46th generation</span>
				<span class='text'>uring the [[Southern Song dynasty]] the Duke Yansheng Kong Duanyou fled south with the Song Emperor to Quzhou in Zhejiang, while the newly established [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)]] in the north appointed Kong Duanyou's brother Kong Duancao who remained in Qufu as Duke Yansheng</span>
				<span class='text'>From that time up until the [[Yuan dynasty]], there were two Duke Yanshengs, once in the north in Qufu and the other in the south at Quzhou</span>
				<span class='text'>During the Yuan dynasty, the Emperor Kublai Khan invited the southern Duke Yansheng Kong Zhu to returned to Qufu</span>
				<span class='text'>Kong Zhu refused, and gave up the title, so the northern branch of the family kept the title of Duke Yansheng</span>
				<span class='text'>The southern branch still remained in Quzhou where they lived to this day</span>
				<span class='text'>Confucius's descendants in Quzhou alone number 30,000</span>
