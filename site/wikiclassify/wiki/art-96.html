				<span class='text'>name phan12 170  In the  system of  the honorific name is rendered as Kung Fu tzu</span>

				<span class='text'>Family backgroundAccording to tradition three generations before Confucius time his ancestors had migrated from the  to the </span>

				<span class='text'> Confucius was a descendant of the  Kings  the </span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>BiographyIt is generally thought that Confucius was born on September 28 551 BC</span>
				<span class='text'>name birth  name creel49 25</span>
				<span class='text'> His birthplace was in Zou  near present day   Province</span>
				<span class='text'>name creel49 25  </span>
				<span class='text'> His father Kong He 孔紇  also known as Shuliang He 叔梁紇 was an officer in the Lu military</span>
				<span class='text'>Kong He died when Confucius was three years old and Confucius was raised by his mother  顏徵在 in poverty</span>
				<span class='text'>name confu  His mother would later die at less than 40 years of age</span>
				<span class='text'>name confu  At age 19 he married his wife surnamed  亓官 and a year later the couple had their first child  孔鯉 name confu  who was later known as Boyu which means Top Fish in Chinese</span>
				<span class='text'>name buryl  Qiguan and Confucius would later have two daughters together one of whom is thought to have died early in her life as a child</span>
				<span class='text'>Confucius was educated at schools for commoners where he studied and learned the </span>
				<span class='text'>Confucius was born into the class of  士 between the aristocracy and the common people</span>
				<span class='text'>He is said to have worked in various government jobs during his early 20s and also worked as a bookkeeper and a caretaker of sheep and horses which he used the proceeds from to give his mother a proper burial</span>
				<span class='text'>name confu  name buryl  When his mother died Confucius aged 23 is said to have  as was the tradition</span>
				<span class='text'>name buryl The  was headed by a ruling ducal house</span>
				<span class='text'>  Under the duke were  whose heads bore the title of viscount and held hereditary positions in the Lu bureaucracy</span>
				<span class='text'>name dubs49 275   The Ji family held the position Minister over the Masses who was also the Prime Minister the Meng family held the position Minister of Works and the Shu family held the position Minister of War</span>
				<span class='text'>name dubs49 275   In the winter of 505 BC Yang Hu—a retainer of the Ji family—rose up in rebellion and seized power from the Ji family</span>
				<span class='text'>name dubs49 275</span>
				<span class='text'> However by the summer of 501 BC the three hereditary families had succeeded in expelling Yang Hu from Lu</span>
				<span class='text'>name dubs49 275   By then Confucius had built up a considerable reputation through his teachings while the families came to see the value of proper conduct and righteousness so they could achieve loyalty to a legitimate government</span>
				<span class='text'>name dubs49 275 6</span>
				<span class='text'> Thus that year 501 BC Confucius came to be appointed to the minor position of governor of a town</span>
				<span class='text'>name dubs49 275 6   Eventually he rose to the position of Minister of Crime</span>
				<span class='text'>name dubs49 275 6  Confucius desired to return the authority of the state to the duke by dismantling the fortifications of the city strongholds belonging to the three families</span>
				<span class='text'>name dubs49 277   This way he could establish a centralized government</span>
				<span class='text'>name dubs49 277   However Confucius relied solely on diplomacy as he had no military authority himself</span>
				<span class='text'>name dubs49 277   In 500 BC Hou Fan—the governor of Hou—revolted against his lord of the Shu family</span>
				<span class='text'>name dubs49 277</span>
				<span class='text'> Although the Meng and Shu families unsuccessfully besieged Hou a loyalist official rose up with the people of Hou and forced Hou Fan to flee to the </span>
				<span class='text'>name dubs49 277   The situation may have been in favor for Confucius as this likely made it possible for Confucius and his disciples to convince the aristocratic families to dismantle the fortifications of their cities</span>
				<span class='text'>name dubs49 277   Eventually after a year and a half Confucius and his disciples succeeded in convincing the Shu family to raze the walls of Hou the Ji family in razing the walls of Bi and the Meng family in razing the walls of Cheng</span>
				<span class='text'>name dubs49 277   First the Shu family led an army towards their city Hou and tore down its walls in 498 BC</span>
				<span class='text'>name dubs49 277   Soon thereafter Gongshan Furao—a retainer of the Ji family—revolted and took control of the forces at Bi</span>
				<span class='text'>name creel49 35 6</span>
				<span class='text'> name duuuu46 277 8   He immediately launched an attack and entered the capital Lu</span>
				<span class='text'>name dubs49 277  Earlier Gongshan had approached Confucius to join him which Confucius considered</span>
				<span class='text'>name creel49 35 6   Even though he disapproved the use of a violent revolution the Ji family dominated the Lu state force for generations and had exiled the previous duke</span>
				<span class='text'>name creel49 35 6   Although he wanted the opportunity to put his principles in practice Confucius gave up on this idea in the end</span>
				<span class='text'>name creel49 35 6   Creel 1949 states that unlike the rebel Yang Hu before him Gongshan may have sought to destroy the three hereditary families and restore the power of the duke</span>
				<span class='text'>name creel49 35</span>
				<span class='text'> However Dubs 1946 is of the view that Gongshan was encouraged by Viscount Ji Huan to invade the Lu capital in an attempt to avoid dismantling the Bi fortified walls</span>
				<span class='text'>name duuuu46 277 8</span>
				<span class='text'> Whatever the situation may have been Gongshan was considered an upright man who continued to defend the state of Lu even after he was forced to flee</span>
				<span class='text'>name creel49 35   name dubs49 278  During the revolt by Gongshan Zhong You 仲由 had managed to keep the duke and the three viscounts together at the court</span>
				<span class='text'>name dubs49 278</span>
				<span class='text'> Zhong You was one of the disciples of Confucius and Confucius had arranged for him to be given the position of governor by the Ji family</span>
				<span class='text'>  When Confucius heard of the raid he requested that Viscount Ji Huan allow the duke and his court to retreat to a stronghold on his palace grounds</span>
				<span class='text'>name dubs49 279</span>
				<span class='text'> Thereafter the heads of the three families and the duke retreated to the Jis palace complex and ascended the Wuzi Terrace</span>
				<span class='text'>name chin07 30</span>
				<span class='text'> Confucius ordered two officers to lead an assault against the rebels</span>
				<span class='text'>name chin07 30   At least one of the two officers was a retainer of the Ji family but they were unable to use the orders while in the presence of the duke viscounts and court</span>
				<span class='text'>name dubs49 279   The rebels were pursued and defeated at Gu</span>
				<span class='text'>name chin07 30   Immediately after the revolt was defeated the Ji family razed the Bi city walls to the ground</span>
				<span class='text'>name chin07 30  The attackers retreated after realizing that they would have to become rebels against the state and against their own lord</span>
				<span class='text'>name dubs49 279   Through Confucius actions the Bi officials had inadvertently revolted against their own lord thus forcing Viscount Ji Huans hand in having to dismantle the walls of Bi as it could have harbored such rebels or confess to instigating the event by going against proper conduct and righteousness as an official</span>
				<span class='text'>name dubs49 279   Dubs 1949 suggests that the incident brought to light Confucius foresight practical political ability and his insight into human character</span>
				<span class='text'>name dubs49 279  When it was time to dismantle the city walls of the Meng family the governor was reluctant to have his city walls torn down and convinced the head of the Meng family not to do so</span>
				<span class='text'>name chin07 30   The  recalls that the governor advised against razing the walls to the ground as he said that it made Cheng vulnerable to the  and cause the destruction of the Meng family</span>
				<span class='text'>name dubs49 279   Even though Viscount Meng Yi gave his word not to interfere with an attempt he went back on his earlier promise to dismantle the walls</span>
				<span class='text'>name dubs49 279  Later in 498 BC Duke Ding personally went with an army to lay siege to Cheng in an attempt to raze its walls to the ground but he did not succeed</span>
				<span class='text'>  Thus Confucius could not achieve the idealistic orms that he wanted including restoration of the legitimate rule of the duke</span>
				<span class='text'>  He had made powerful enemies within the state especially with Viscount Ji Huan due to his successes so far</span>
				<span class='text'>name dubs46 281</span>
				<span class='text'> According to accounts in the  and  Confucius departed his homeland in 497 BC after his support for the failed attempt of dismantling the fortified city walls of the powerful Ji Meng and Shu families</span>
				<span class='text'>  He left the state of Lu without resigning remaining in self exile and unable to return as long as Viscount Ji Huan was alive</span>
				<span class='text'>name dubs46 281  The  states that the neighboring  was worried that Lu was becoming too powerful while Confucius was involved in the government of the Lu state</span>
				<span class='text'>According to this account Qi decided to sabotage Lus orms by sending 100 good horses and 80 beautiful dancing girls to the Duke of Lu</span>
				<span class='text'>The Duke indulged himself in pleasure and did not attend to official duties for three days</span>
				<span class='text'>Confucius was deeply disappointed and resolved to leave Lu and seek better opportunities yet to leave at once would expose the misbehavior of the Duke and theore bring public humiliation to the ruler Confucius was serving</span>
				<span class='text'>Confucius theore waited for the Duke to make a lesser mistake</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon after the Duke neglected to send to Confucius a portion of the sacrificial meat that was his due according to custom and Confucius seized upon this pretext to leave both his post and the Lu state</span>
				<span class='text'>fter Confucius resignation he began a long journey or set of journeys around the  of north east and central China traditionally including the states of    and </span>
				<span class='text'>At the courts of these states he expounded his political beliefs but did not see them implemented</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to the  Confucius returned home to his native Lu when he was 68 after he was invited to do so by Ji Kangzi the chief minister of Lu</span>
				<span class='text'>name return  The Analects depict him spending his last years teaching 72 or 77  and transmitting the old wisdom via a set of texts called the </span>
				<span class='text'>uring his return Confucius sometimes acted as an advisor to several government officials in Lu including Ji Kangzi on matters including governance and crime</span>
				<span class='text'>name return PhilosophyAlthough Confucianism is often followed in a religious manner by the Chinese many argue that its values are secular and theore it isnt a religion but more akin to a secular morality</span>
				<span class='text'>Proponents argue that despite the secular nature of Confucianisms teachings it is based on a worldview that is religious</span>
				<span class='text'> Confucianism discusses elements of the  and views concerning  but it is relatively unconcerned with some spiritual matters often considered essential to religious thought such as the nature of s</span>
				<span class='text'>However Confucius is said to have believed in astrology saying Heaven sends down its good or evil symbols and wise men act accordingly</span>
				<span class='text'>name Parkers In the  Confucius presents himself as a transmitter who invented nothing</span>
				<span class='text'>He puts the greatest emphasis on the importance of study and it is the  for study  that opens the text</span>
				<span class='text'>Far from trying to build a systematic or  theory he wanted his disciples to master and internalize the old classics so that their deep thought and thorough study would allow them to relate the moral problems of the present to past political events as recorded in the Annals or the past expressions of commoners feelings and noblemens lections as in the poems of the </span>
				<span class='text'>ne of the deepest teachings of Confucius may have been the superiority of personal exemplification over explicit rules of behavior</span>
				<span class='text'>His moral teachings emphasized self cultivation emulation of moral exemplars and the attainment of skilled judgment rather than knowledge of rules</span>
				<span class='text'>Confucian ethics may be considered a type of </span>
				<span class='text'>His teachings rarely rely on reasoned argument and ethical ideals and methods are conveyed more indirectly through   and even </span>
				<span class='text'>His teachings require examination and context in order to be understood</span>
				<span class='text'>A good example is found in this famous anecdoteWhen the stables were burnt down on returning from court Confucius said Was anyone hurt He did not ask about the horses</span>
				<span class='text'>nalects X</span>
				<span class='text'>1 tr</span>
				<span class='text'> 10–13 tr</span>
				<span class='text'> or X 17 tr</span>
				<span class='text'>By not asking about the horses Confucius demonstrates that the sage values human beings over property readers are led to lect on whether their response would follow Confucius and to pursue self improvement if it would not have</span>
				<span class='text'>Confucius as an exemplar of human excellence serves as the ultimate model rather than a deity or a universally true set of abstract principles</span>
				<span class='text'>For these reasons according to many commentators Confucius teachings may be considered a Chinese example of </span>
				<span class='text'>ne of his teachings was a variant of the  sometimes called the  owing to its negative formWhat you do not wish for yourself do not do to others</span>
				<span class='text'>i Gong a disciple asked Is there any one word that could guide a person throughout life br  The Master replied How about reciprocity Never impose on others what you would not choose for yourself</span>
				<span class='text'>nalects XV</span>
				<span class='text'>4 tr</span>
				<span class='text'>David HintonOften overlooked in Confucian ethics are the virtues to the self sincerity and the cultivation of knowledge</span>
				<span class='text'>Virtuous action towards others begins with virtuous and sincere thought which begins with knowledge</span>
				<span class='text'> A virtuous disposition without knowledge is susceptible to corruption and virtuous action without sincerity is not true righteousness</span>
				<span class='text'>Cultivating knowledge and sincerity is also important for ones own sake the superior person loves learning for the sake of learning and righteousness for the sake of righteousness</span>
				<span class='text'>he Confucian theory of ethics as exemplified in   is based on three important conceptual aspects of life a ceremonies associated with sacrifice to ancestors and deities of various types b social and political institutions and c the etiquette of daily behavior</span>
				<span class='text'>It was believed by some that lǐ originated from the heavens but Confucius stressed the development of lǐ through the actions of sage leaders in human history</span>
				<span class='text'>His discussions of lǐ seem to redefine the term to er to all actions committed by a person to build the ideal society rather than those simply conforming with canonical standards of ceremony</span>
				<span class='text'>n the early Confucian tradition lǐ was doing the proper thing at the proper time balancing between maintaining existing norms to perpetuate an ethical social fabric and violating them in order to accomplish ethical good</span>
				<span class='text'>Training in the lǐ of past sages cultivates in people virtues that include ethical judgment about when lǐ must be adapted in light of situational contexts</span>
				<span class='text'>n Confucianism the concept of li is closely related to yì  which is based upon the idea of reciprocity</span>
				<span class='text'>Yì can be translated as  though it may simply mean what is ethically best to do in a certain context</span>
				<span class='text'>The term contrasts with action done out of </span>
				<span class='text'>While pursuing ones own self interest is not necessarily bad one would be a better more righteous person if ones life was based upon following a path designed to enhance the greater good</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus an outcome of yì is doing the right thing for the right reason</span>
				<span class='text'>ust as action according to  should be adapted to conform to the aspiration of adhering to yì so yì is linked to the core value of rén </span>
				<span class='text'>consists of 5 basic virtues seriousness generosity sincerity diligence and kindness</span>
				<span class='text'>name Bonevac09 40</span>
				<span class='text'> Rén is the virtue of perfectly fulfilling ones responsibilities toward others most often translated as benevolence or humaneness translator  calls it Goodness with a capital G and other translations that have been put forth include authoritativeness and selflessness</span>
				<span class='text'>Confucius moral system was based upon  and understanding others rather than divinely ordained rules</span>
				<span class='text'>To develop ones spontaneous responses of rén so that these could guide action intuitively was even better than living by the rules of yì</span>
				<span class='text'>Confucius asserts that virtue is a means between extremes</span>
				<span class='text'>For example the properly generous person gives the right amount—not too much and not too little</span>
				<span class='text'>name Bonevac09 40  Confucius political thought is based upon his ethical thought</span>
				<span class='text'>He argued that the best government is one that rules through rites lǐ and peoples  and not by using bribery and coercion</span>
				<span class='text'>He explained that this is one of the most important analects If the people be led by laws and uniformity sought to be given them by punishments they will try to avoid the punishment but have no sense of shame</span>
				<span class='text'>If they be led by virtue and uniformity sought to be given them by the rules of propriety they will have the sense of the shame and moreover will become good</span>
				<span class='text'>Translated by  in the  </span>
				<span class='text'>This sense of shame is an internalisation of  where the punishment precedes the evil action instead of following it in the form of laws as in </span>
				<span class='text'>onfucius looked nostalgically upon earlier days and urged the Chinese particularly those with political power to model themselves on earlier examples</span>
				<span class='text'>In times of division chaos and endless wars between feudal states he wanted to restore the   that could unify the world  all under Heaven and bestow peace and prosperity on the people</span>
				<span class='text'>Because his vision of personal and social perfections was framed as a revival of the ordered society of earlier times Confucius is often considered a great proponent of  but a closer look at what he proposes often shows that he used and perhaps twisted past institutions and rites to push a new political agenda of his own a revival of a unified royal state whose rulers would succeed to power on the basis of their moral merits instead of lineage</span>
				<span class='text'>These would be rulers devoted to their people striving for personal and social  and such a ruler would spread his own virtues to the people instead of imposing proper behavior with laws and rules</span>
				<span class='text'>onfucius did not believe in the concept of  which is itself an  concept unknown in ancient China but could be interpreted by Confucius principles recommending against individuals electing their own political leaders to govern them or that anyone is capable of self government</span>
				<span class='text'>He expressed fears that the masses lacked the intellect to make decisions for themselves and that in his view since not everyone is created equal not everyone has a right of self government</span>
				<span class='text'>While he supported the idea of government ruling by a virtuous king his ideas contained a number of elements to limit the power of rulers</span>
				<span class='text'>He argued for representing  in language and  was of paramount importance</span>
				<span class='text'>Even in  truth must always be represented</span>
				<span class='text'>Confucius believed that if a ruler were to lead correctly by action that orders would be deemed unnecessary in that others will follow the proper actions of their ruler</span>
				<span class='text'>In discussing the relationship between a king and his subject or a father and his son he underlined the need to give due respect to superiors</span>
				<span class='text'>This demanded that the subordinates must give advice to their superiors if the superiors were considered to be taking the course of action that was wrong</span>
				<span class='text'> Confucius believed in ruling by example if you lead correctly orders by force or punishment isnt necessary</span>
				<span class='text'>DisciplesThere is not much known of Confucius disciples and a little over half of them had their surnames recorded in the </span>
				<span class='text'>name creel49 30</span>
				<span class='text'> The  records 22 names that are most likely Confucius disciples while the  records 24 names although it is quite certain that there have been many more disciples whose name were not recorded</span>
				<span class='text'>name creel49 30   Most of Confucius disciples were from the  while others were from neighboring states</span>
				<span class='text'>name creel49 30   For example Zigong was from the  and Sima Niu was from the </span>
				<span class='text'>name creel49 30   Confucius favorite disciple was Yan Hui most probably one of the most impoverished of them all</span>
				<span class='text'>name creel49 30   Sima Niu in contrast to Yan Hui was from a hereditary noble family hailing from the Song state</span>
				<span class='text'>name creel49 30   Under Confucius teachings the disciples became well learned in the principles and methods of government</span>
				<span class='text'>name creel49 32   He often engaged in discussion and debate with his students and gave high importance to their studies in history poetry and ritual</span>
				<span class='text'>name creel49 32   Confucius advocated loyalty to principle rather than to individual acumen in which orm was to be achieved by persuasion rather than violence</span>
				<span class='text'>name creel49 32</span>
				<span class='text'> Even though Confucius denounced them for their practices the aristocracy was likely attracted to the idea of having trustworthy officials who were studied in morals as the circumstances of the time made it desirable</span>
				<span class='text'>name creel49 32   In fact the disciple Zilu even died defending his ruler in Wei</span>
				<span class='text'>name creel49 32  Yang Hu who was a subordinate of the Ji family had dominated the Lu government from 505 to 502 and even attempted a coup which narrowly failed</span>
				<span class='text'>name creel49 32   As a likely consequence it was after that that the first disciples of Confucius were appointed to government positions</span>
				<span class='text'>name creel49 32   A few of Confucius disciples went on to attain official positions of some importance some of which were arranged by Confucius</span>
				<span class='text'>name creel49 31</span>
				<span class='text'> By the time Confucius was 50 years old the Ji family had consolidated their power in the Lu state over the ruling ducal house</span>
				<span class='text'>name creel49 33</span>
				<span class='text'> Even though the Ji family had practices with which Confucius disagreed and disapproved they nonetheless gave Confucius disciples many opportunities for employment</span>
				<span class='text'>name creel49 33   Confucius continued to remind his disciples to stay true to their principles and renounced those who did not all the while being openly critical of the Ji family</span>
				<span class='text'>name creel49 32 3</span>
				<span class='text'>LegacyConfucius teachings were later turned into an elaborate set of rules and practices by his numerous disciples and followers who organized his teachings into the Analects</span>
				<span class='text'>Confucius disciples and his only grandson  continued his philosophical school after his death</span>
				<span class='text'>These efforts spread Confucian ideals to students who then became officials in many of the royal courts in China thereby giving Confucianism the first wide scale test of its </span>
				<span class='text'>wo of Confucius most famous later followers emphasized radically different aspects of his teachings</span>
				<span class='text'>In the centuries after his death   and   both composed important teachings elaborating in different ways on the fundamental ideas associated with Confucius</span>
				<span class='text'> 4th century BC articulated the innate goodness in human beings as a source of the ethical intuitions that guide people towards rén yì and lǐ while  3rd century BC underscored the realistic and materialistic aspects of Confucian thought stressing that morality was inculcated in society through tradition and in individuals through training</span>
				<span class='text'>In time their writings together with the Analects and other core texts came to constitute the philosophical corpus of Confucianism</span>
				<span class='text'>his realignment in Confucian thought was parallel to the development of  which saw filial piety as self interest and not a useful tool for a ruler to create an effective state</span>
				<span class='text'> A disagreement between these two political philosophies came to a head in 223 BC when the  conquered all of China</span>
				<span class='text'> Prime Minister of the  convinced  to abandon the Confucians recommendation of awarding fiefs akin to the  before them which he saw as being against to the Legalist idea of centralizing the state around the ruler</span>
				<span class='text'> When the Confucian advisers pressed their point Li Si had many Confucian scholars killed and their books burned—considered a huge blow to the philosophy and Chinese scholarship</span>
				<span class='text'>nder the succeeding  and  Confucian ideas gained even more widespread prominence</span>
				<span class='text'> Under  the works of Confucius were made the official imperial philosophy and required reading for civil service examinations in 140 BC which was continued nearly unbroken until the end of the 19th Century</span>
				<span class='text'>As  lost support by the time of the Han  the main philosophical contenders were Legalism which Confucian thought somewhat absorbed the teachings of  whose focus on more spiritual ideas kept it from direct conflict with Confucianism and the new  religion which gained acceptance during the  era</span>
				<span class='text'>Both Confucian ideas and Confucian trained officials were relied upon in the  and even the  although Kublai Khan distrusted handing over provincial control to them</span>
				<span class='text'>uring the  the scholar  AD 1130–1200 added ideas from  and  into Confucianism</span>
				<span class='text'>In his life Zhu Xi was largely ignored but not long after his death his ideas became the new orthodox view of what Confucian texts actually meant</span>
				<span class='text'>Modern historians view Zhu Xi as having created something rather different and call his way of thinking </span>
				<span class='text'>Neo Confucianism held sway in China Japan Korea and Vietnam until the 19th century</span>

				<span class='text'>ecause of the huge interest in the Confucius family tree there was a project in China to test the DNA of known family members of the collateral branches in mainland China</span>
				<span class='text'>  Among other things this would allow scientists to identify a common Y chromosome in male descendants of Confucius</span>
				<span class='text'>If the descent were truly unbroken father to son since Confucius lifetime the males in the family would all have the same Y chromosome as their direct male ancestor with slight mutations due to the passage of time</span>
