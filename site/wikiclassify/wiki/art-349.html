				<span class='text'>--&gt; an English [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in London in 1968</span>
				<span class='text'>The group consisted of guitarist [[Jimmy Page]], singer [[Robert Plant]], bassist and keyboardist [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]], and drummer [[John Bonham]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The band's heavy, guitar-driven sound, rooted in [[blues]] and [[psychedelia]] on their early albums, has earned them recognition as one of the [[progenitor]]s of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], though their unique style drew from a wide variety of influences, including [[folk music]]</span>
				<span class='text'>fter changing their name from the New [[The Yardbirds|Yardbirds]], Led Zeppelin signed a deal with [[Atlantic Records]] that afforded them considerable artistic freedom</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the group was initially unpopular with critics, they achieved significant commercial success with albums such as ''[[Led Zeppelin (album)|Led Zeppelin]]'' (1969), ''[[Led Zeppelin II]]'' (1969), ''[[Led Zeppelin III]]'' (1970), ''[[Led Zeppelin IV]]'' (1971), ''[[Houses of the Holy]]'' (1973), and ''[[Physical Graffiti]]'' (1975)</span>
				<span class='text'>Their fourth album, which features the track &quot;[[Stairway to Heaven]]&quot;, is among the most popular and influential works in rock music, and it helped to secure the group's popularity</span>
				<span class='text'>age wrote most of Led Zeppelin's music, particularly early in their career, while Plant generally supplied the lyrics</span>
				<span class='text'>Jones' keyboard-based compositions later became central to the group's catalogue, which featured increasing experimentation</span>
				<span class='text'>The latter half of their career saw a series of [[Led Zeppelin concerts|record-breaking tours]] that earned the group a reputation for excess and debauchery</span>
				<span class='text'>Although they remained commercially and critically successful, their output and touring schedule were limited during the late 1970s, and the group disbanded following Bonham's death from alcohol-related asphyxia in 1980</span>
				<span class='text'>In the decades that followed, the surviving members sporadically collaborated and participated in one-off Led Zeppelin reunions</span>
				<span class='text'>The most successful of these was the 2007 [[Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert]] in London, with [[Jason Bonham]] taking his late father's place behind the drums</span>

				<span class='text'>Page soon switched from bass to lead guitar, creating a dual lead guitar line-up with [[Jeff Beck]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Following Beck's departure in October 1966, the Yardbirds, tired from constant touring and recording, began to wind down</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Yorke|1993|pp=56–59}} Page wanted to form a [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] with him and Beck on guitars, and [[the Who]]'s [[Keith Moon]] and [[John Entwistle]] on drums and bass, respectively</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=13–15}} The group never formed, although Page, Beck, and Moon did record a song together in 1966, &quot;[[Beck's Bolero]]&quot;, in a session that also included bassist-keyboardist [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Davis|1985|pp=28–29}}The Yardbirds played their final gig in July 1968 at [[University of Bedfordshire|Luton College of Technology]] in Bedfordshire</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Buckley|2003|p=1198}} They were still committed to several concerts in Scandinavia, so drummer [[Jim McCarty]] and vocalist [[Keith Relf]] authorised Page and bassist [[Chris Dreja]] to use &quot;the Yardbirds&quot; name to fulfill the band's obligations</span>
				<span class='text'>Page and Dreja began putting a new line-up together</span>
				<span class='text'>Page's first choice for the lead singer was [[Terry Reid]], but Reid declined the offer and suggested [[Robert Plant]], a singer for the [[Band of Joy]] and Hobbstweedle</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Yorke|1993|p=65}} Plant eventually accepted the position, recommending former Band of Joy drummer [[John Bonham]]</span>

				<span class='text'>The album's track &quot;Jim's Blues&quot;, with Plant on harmonica, was the first studio track to feature all four future members of Led Zeppelin</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Wall|2008|p=54}}The band completed the [[Led Zeppelin Scandinavian Tour 1968|Scandinavian tour]] as the New Yardbirds, playing together for the first time in front of a live audience at Gladsaxe Teen Clubs in [[Gladsaxe Municipality|Gladsaxe]], Denmark, on 7 September 1968</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Wall|2008|p=54}} Later that month, they began recording their first album, which was based on their live set</span>
				<span class='text'>The album was recorded and mixed in nine days, and Page covered the costs</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=51–52}} After the album's completion, the band were forced to change their name after Dreja issued a [[cease and desist]] letter, stating that Page was allowed to use the New Yardbirds moniker for the Scandinavian dates only</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=72–73}} One account of how the new band's name was chosen held that Moon and Entwistle had suggested that a supergroup with Page and Beck would go down like a &quot;lead balloon&quot;, an idiom for disastrous results</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Shadwick|2005|p=36}} The group dropped the 'a' in ''lead'' at the suggestion of their manager, [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]], so that those unfamiliar with the term would not pronounce it &quot;leed&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Davis|1985|p=57}} The word &quot;balloon&quot; was replaced by &quot;[[zeppelin]]&quot;, a word which, according to music journalist Keith Shadwick, brought &quot;the perfect combination of heavy and light, combustibility and grace&quot; to Page's mind</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Shadwick|2005|p=36}}In November 1968, Grant secured a $143,000 advance contract from [[Atlantic Records]], which was then the biggest deal of its kind for a new band</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Wall|2008|p=84}} Atlantic were a label with a catalogue of mainly blues, soul, and jazz artists, but in the late 1960s they began to take an interest in British [[progressive rock]] acts</span>
				<span class='text'>Record executives signed Led Zeppelin without having ever seen them</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Fortnam|2008|p=43}} Under the terms of their contract, the band had autonomy in deciding when they would release albums and tour, and had the final say over the contents and design of each album</span>
				<span class='text'>They would also decide how to promote each release and which tracks to release as singles</span>
				<span class='text'>They formed their own company, Superhype, to handle all publishing rights</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lewis|1994|p=3}}=== Early years: 1968–70 ===The band began their first tour of the UK on 4 October 1968, they still were billed as the New Yardbirds, and played their first show as Led Zeppelin at the [[University of Surrey]] in [[Battersea]] on 25 October</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=73–74}} Tour manager [[Richard Cole]], who would become a major figure in the touring life of the group, organised their [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour 1968–1969|first North American tour]] at the end of the year</span>

				<span class='text'>Recorded mostly on the road at various North American studios, it was an even greater commercial success than their first album, and reached the number one chart position in the US and the UK</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Wall|2008|p=161}} The album further developed the mostly blues-rock musical style established on their debut release, creating a sound that was &quot;heavy and hard, brutal and direct&quot;, and which would be highly influential and frequently imitated</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Erlewine|2010}} Steve Waksman has suggested that ''Led Zeppelin II'' was &quot;the musical starting point for heavy metal&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Waksman|2001|p=263}}The band saw their albums as indivisible, complete listening experiences, disliking the re-editing of existing tracks for release as singles</span>
				<span class='text'>Grant maintained an aggressive pro-album stance, particularly in the UK, where there were few radio and TV outlets for rock music</span>
				<span class='text'>Without the band's consent, however, some songs were released as singles, particularly in the US</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=166–167}} In 1969 an edited version of &quot;[[Whole Lotta Love]]&quot;, a track from their second album, was released as a single in the US</span>
				<span class='text'>It reached number four in the ''Billboard'' chart in January 1970, selling over one million copies and helping to cement the band's popularity</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Wall|2008|p=165}} The group also increasingly shunned television appearances, citing their preference that their fans hear and see them in live concerts</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Welch|1994|p=49}}{{sfn|Wale|1973|p=11}}Following the release of their second album, Led Zeppelin completed several more US tours</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Erlewine|2011a}} Some early [[Led Zeppelin concerts]] lasted more than four hours, with expanded and improvised live versions of their repertoire</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of these shows have been preserved as [[Led Zeppelin bootleg recordings|bootleg recordings]]</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Erlewine|2011a}} The influence of American blues artists such as [[Muddy Waters]] and [[Skip James]] was particularly apparent on their first two albums, as was the distinct [[country blues]] style of [[Howlin' Wolf]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Gulla|2001|pp=153–159}} Tracks were structured around the [[twelve-bar blues]] on every studio album except for one, and the blues directly and indirectly influenced other songs both musically and lyrically</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Fast|2001|p=8}} The band were also strongly influenced by the music of the [[British folk revival|British]], [[Celtic music|Celtic]], and [[American folk music revival|American folk revivals]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Erlewine|2011a}} Scottish folk guitarist [[Bert Jansch]] helped inspire Page, and from him he adapted [[Guitar tunings#Open|open tunings]] and aggressive strokes into his playing</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Gulla|2001|pp=153–159}}The material on the first two albums was largely constructed out of extended jams of [[List of blues standards|blues standards]]{{sfn|Erlewine|2011a}} and [[Folk music|folk songs]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=56–59}}{{sfn|Fast|2001|p=26}} This method led to the mixing of musical and lyrical elements of different songs and versions, as well as improvised passages, to create new material, but would lead to later accusations of plagiarism and legal disputes over copyright</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=56–59}} Usually the music was developed first, sometimes with improvised lyrics that might then be rewritten for the final version of the song</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Fast|2001|p=26}} From the visit to [[Bron-Yr-Aur]] in 1970, the songwriting partnership between Page and Plant became predominant, with Page supplying the music, largely via his acoustic guitar, and Plant emerging as the band's chief lyricist</span>
				<span class='text'>Jones and Bonham then added to the material, in rehearsal or in the studio, as a song was developed</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=294–296 and 364–366}} In the later stages of the band's career, Page took a back seat in composition and Jones became increasingly important in producing music, often composed on the keyboard</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Fast|2001|p=25}} Many of the band's songs dealt with themes of romance, unrequited love and sexual conquest, which were common in rock, pop and blues music</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Cope|2010|p=81}} Particularly on ''Led Zeppelin III'', they incorporated elements of [[mythology]] and [[mysticism]] into their music,{{sfn|Erlewine|2011a}} which largely grew out of Plant's interest in legends and history</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Fast|2001|p=59}} These elements were often taken to reflect Page's interest in the [[occult]], which resulted in accusations that the recordings contained [[subliminal stimuli|subliminal]] satanic messages, some of which were said to be contained in [[backmasking]]; these claims were generally dismissed by the band and music critics</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=278–279}} Susan Fast argues that as Plant emerged as the band's main lyricist, the songs more obviously reflected his alignment with the West Coast [[counterculture of the 1960s]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Fast|2001|pp=9–10}} In the later part of the band's career Plant's lyrics became more autobiographical, and less optimistic, drawing on his own experiences and circumstances</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Walser|1993|p=10}} These elements mean that they are often cited as one of the progenitors of [[hard rock]]{{sfn|Fast|2011|p=5}} and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]{{sfn|Walser|1993|p=10}}{{sfn|Rolling Stone|2009}} and they have been described as the &quot;definitive heavy metal band&quot;,{{sfn|Erlewine|2011a}} although the band members have often eschewed the label</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bukszpan|2003|p=124}} Part of this reputation depends on the band's use of distorted guitar riffs on songs like &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; and &quot;[[The Wanton Song]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Buckley|2003|p=1198}}{{sfn|Fast|2001|pp=113–117}} Often riffs were not doubled by guitar, bass and drums exactly, but instead there were melodic or rhythmic variations;{{sfn|Fast|2001|p=96}} as in &quot;[[Black Dog (song)|Black Dog]]&quot;, where three different [[time signature]]s are used</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Schinder &amp; Schwartz|2008|p=390}} Page's guitar playing incorporated elements of the [[blues scale]] with those of [[Music of Asia|eastern music]]</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Fast|2001|p=13}}{{sfn|Buckley|2003|p=1198}}Page stated that he wanted Led Zeppelin to produce music that had &quot;light and shade&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>This began to be more clearly realised beginning with ''Led Zeppelin III'', which made greater use of acoustic instruments</span>
