				<span class='text'>During his reign, Justinian sought to revive the empire's greatness and reconquer the lost [[Western Roman Empire|western half]] of the historical Roman Empire</span>
				<span class='text'>Justinian's rule constitutes a distinct epoch in the history of the [[Later Roman empire]], and his reign is marked by the ambitious but only partly realized ''renovatio imperii'', or &quot;restoration of the Empire&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Haldon, ''Byzantium in the seventh century'' (Cambridge, 2003), 17–19</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Because of his restoration activities, Justinian has sometimes been called the &quot;[[Last of the Romans|last Roman]]&quot; in modern historiography</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;For instance by G</span>
				<span class='text'>P</span>
				<span class='text'>Baker (''Justinian'', New York 1938), or in the ''Outline of Great Books'' series (''Justinian the Great'')</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This ambition was expressed by the partial recovery of the territories of the defunct [[western Roman empire]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; His general, [[Belisarius]], swiftly conquered the [[Vandals|Vandal kingdom]] in North Africa, re-extending Roman control to the [[Atlantic Ocean]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Subsequently Belisarius, [[Narses]], and other generals conquered the [[Ostrogothic kingdom]], restoring [[Dalmatia]], [[Sicily]], [[Italian peninsula|Italy]], and [[Rome]] to the empire after more than half a century of rule by the Ostrogoths</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Liberius (praetorian prefect)|prefect Liberius]] reclaimed most of southern [[Iberian peninsula|Iberia]], establishing the province of [[Spania]]</span>

				<span class='text'>As a collection it gathers together the many sources in which the ''leges'' (laws) and the other rules were expressed or published: proper laws, [[Roman Senate|senatorial]] consults (''senatusconsulta''), imperial decrees, [[case law]], and jurists' opinions and interpretations (''responsa prudentum'')</span>

				<span class='text'>While the crowd was rioting in the streets, Justinian considered fleeing the capital, but eventually decided to stay, apparently on the prompting of Theodora, who refused to leave</span>

				<span class='text'>Belisarius was sent back to Italy late in 544, but lacked sufficient troops</span>
				<span class='text'>Making no headway, he was relieved of his command in 548</span>

				<span class='text'>Totila also plundered [[Sicily]] and attacked the Greek coastlines</span>

				<span class='text'>In 552, Justinian dispatched a force of 2,000 men; according to the historian [[Jordanes]], this army was led by the octogenarian [[Liberius (praetorian prefect)|Liberius]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Getica'', 303&lt;/ref&gt; The Byzantines took [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] and other cities on the southeastern coast and founded the new province of [[Spania]] before being checked by their former ally Athanagild, who had by now become king</span>
				<span class='text'>This campaign marked the apogee of Byzantine expansion</span>
				<span class='text'>uring Justinian's reign, the [[Balkans]] suffered from several incursions by the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and [[Slavic peoples]] who lived north of the [[Danube]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Here, Justinian resorted mainly to a combination of diplomacy and a system of defensive works</span>
				<span class='text'>In 559 a particularly dangerous invasion of [[Slavic peoples|Sklavinoi]] and [[Kutrigurs]] under their [[Khan (title)|khan]] [[Zabergan]] threatened Constantinople, but they were repulsed by the aged general Belisarius</span>

				<span class='text'>]Justinian's ambition to restore the Roman Empire to its former glory was only partly realized</span>
				<span class='text'>In the West, the brilliant early military successes of the 530s were followed by years of stagnation</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The heavy taxes that the administration imposed upon its population were deeply resented</span>
				<span class='text'>While the final victory in Italy and the conquest of the coast of southern [[Hispania]] significantly enlarged the area over which the Empire could project its power and influence, and while they must have contributed to the Empire's prestige, most of the conquests proved ephemeral</span>
				<span class='text'>The greater part of Italy would be lost to the invading [[Lombards]] three years after Justinian's death (568), the newly founded province of Spania was completely recovered by the Hispanian Visigoths in 624 under the leadership of [[Suintila]], and within a century and a half Africa would be forever lost for the empire to the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun]] and [[Umayyad Caliphate]]s during the [[Muslim conquests]]</span>
				<span class='text'>vents of the later years of the reign showed that Constantinople itself was not safe from barbarian incursions from the north, and even the relatively benevolent historian [[Menander Protector]] felt the need to attribute the Emperor's failure to protect the capital to the weakness of his body in his old age</span>

				<span class='text'>17–19</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See Pohl, ibidem</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Religious activities===Justinian saw the orthodoxy of his empire threatened by diverging religious currents, especially [[Monophysitism]], which had many adherents in the eastern provinces of Syria and Egypt</span>
				<span class='text'>Monophysite doctrine, which maintains that Jesus Christ had one divine nature or a synthesis of a divine and human nature, had been condemned as a [[heresy]] by the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451, and the tolerant policies towards Monophysitism of [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] and [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius I]] had been a source of tension in the relationship with the bishops of Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>Justin reversed this trend and confirmed the Chalcedonian doctrine, openly condemning the Monophysites</span>
				<span class='text'>Justinian, who continued this policy, tried to impose religious unity on his subjects by forcing them to accept doctrinal compromises that might appeal to all parties, a policy that proved unsuccessful as he satisfied none of them</span>
				<span class='text'>ear the end of his life, Justinian became ever more inclined towards the Monophysite doctrine, especially in the form of [[Aphthartodocetae|Aphthartodocetism]], but he died before being able to issue any legislation that would have elevated its teachings to the status of dogma</span>
				<span class='text'>The empress Theodora sympathized with the Monophysites and is said to have been a constant source of pro-Monophysite intrigues at the court in Constantinople in the earlier years</span>
				<span class='text'>In the course of his reign, Justinian, who had a genuine interest in matters of theology, authored a small number of theological treatises</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Treatises written by Justinian can be found in Migne's ''Patrologia Graeca'', Vol</span>

				<span class='text'>In addition, the factions in the East that had become stirred up and disaffected because of Chalcedon needed restraining and pacifying</span>
				<span class='text'>This problem proved the more difficult because, in the East, the dissenting groups exceeded supporters of Chalcedon both in numerical strength and in intellectual ability</span>
				<span class='text'>Tension from the incompatibility of the two aims grew: whoever chose Rome and the West must renounce the East, and vice versa</span>

				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|Consular [[diptych]] displaying Justinian's full name (Constantinople 521)]]Justinian entered the arena of ecclesiastical statecraft shortly after his uncle's accession in 518, and put an end to the [[Monophysitism|Monophysite]] [[Schism (religion)|schism]] that had prevailed between Rome and Constantinople since 483</span>
				<span class='text'>The recognition of the [[Holy See|Roman see]] as the highest ecclesiastical authority&lt;ref&gt;cf</span>
				<span class='text'>''Novellae'', cxxxi</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; remained the cornerstone of his Western policy</span>
				<span class='text'>Offensive as it was to many in the East, nonetheless Justinian felt himself entirely free to take a Despotic stance toward the [[pope]]s such as [[Silverius]] and [[Pope Vigilius|Vigilius]]</span>
				<span class='text'>While no compromise could ever be accepted by the dogmatic wing of the church, his sincere efforts at reconciliation gained him the approval of the major body of the church</span>
				<span class='text'>A signal proof was his attitude in the [[Scythian monks#Theopaschite doctrine|Theopaschite controversy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>At the outset he was of the opinion that the question turned on a quibble of words</span>
				<span class='text'>By degrees, however, Justinian came to understand that the formula at issue not only appeared orthodox, but might also serve as a conciliatory measure toward the Monophysites, and he made a vain attempt to do this in the religious conference with the followers of [[Severus of Antioch]] in 533</span>
				<span class='text'>gain, Justinian moved toward compromise in the religious edict of 15 March 533,&lt;ref&gt;''Cod</span>
				<span class='text'>', L, i</span>
				<span class='text'>6</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The serious blunder that he had made at the beginning by abetting a severe persecution of the Monophysite bishops and monks and thereby embittering the population of vast regions and provinces, he remedied eventually</span>
				<span class='text'>His constant aim now remained to win over the Monophysites, yet not to surrender the Chalcedonian faith</span>
				<span class='text'>For many at court, he did not go far enough: Theodora especially would have rejoiced to see the Monophysites favoured unreservedly</span>
				<span class='text'>Justinian, however, felt restrained by the complications that would have ensued with the West</span>
				<span class='text'>But in the condemnation of the [[Three-Chapter Controversy|''Three Chapters'']] Justinian tried to satisfy both the East and the West, but succeeded in satisfying neither</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the pope assented to the condemnation, the West believed that the Emperor had acted contrary to the decrees of Chalcedon</span>
				<span class='text'>Though many delegates emerged in the East subservient to Justinian, many, especially the Monophysites, remained unsatisfied; all the more bitter for him because during his last years he took an even greater interest in theological matters</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Most notably, he had the [[Hagia Sophia]], originally a [[basilica]]-style church that had been burnt down during the [[Nika riots]], splendidly rebuilt according to a completely different ground plan, under the architectural supervision of [[Isidore of Miletus]] and [[Anthemius of Tralles]]</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Procopius, Justinian stated at the completion of this edifice, &quot;Solomon I have outdone thee&quot; (in reference to the 1st Jewish temple)</span>
				<span class='text'>This new cathedral, with its magnificent dome filled with mosaics, remained the centre of eastern Christianity for centuries</span>
				<span class='text'>nother prominent church in the capital, the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]], which had been in a very poor state near the end of the 5th century, was likewise rebuilt</span>

				<span class='text'>189&lt;/ref&gt; Works of embellishment were not confined to churches alone: excavations at the site of the [[Great Palace of Constantinople]] have yielded several high-quality mosaics dating from Justinian's reign, and a [[Column of Justinian|column topped by a bronze statue]] of Justinian on horseback and dressed in a military costume was erected in the [[Augustaeum]] in Constantinople in 543</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Justinian also strengthened the borders of the Empire from Africa to the East through the construction of fortifications, and ensured Constantinople of its water supply through construction of underground [[cisterns]] (see [[Basilica Cistern]])</span>
				<span class='text'>To prevent floods from damaging the strategically important border town [[Dara (Mesopotamia)|Dara]], [[Dara Dam|an advanced arch dam]] was built</span>
				<span class='text'>During his reign the large [[Sangarius Bridge]] was built in [[Bithynia]], securing a major military supply route to the east</span>
				<span class='text'>Furthermore, Justinian restored cities damaged by earthquake or war and built a new city near his place of birth called [[Justiniana Prima]], which was intended to replace [[Thessalonica]] as the political and religious centre of [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Illyricum]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n Justinian's reign, and partly under his patronage, Byzantine culture produced noteworthy historians, including [[Procopius]] and [[Agathias]], and poets such as [[Paul the Silentiary]] and [[Romanus the Singer|Romanus the Melodist]] flourished</span>
				<span class='text'>On the other hand, centres of learning as the Platonic Academy in Athens and the famous [[Law School of Beirut]]&lt;ref&gt;Following a terrible earthquake in 551, the school at Beirut was transferred to Sidon and had no further significance after that date</span>

				<span class='text'>ne important luxury product was [[silk]], which was imported and then processed in the Empire</span>
				<span class='text'>In order to protect the manufacture of silk products, Justinian granted a monopoly to the imperial factories in 541</span>

				<span class='text'>157–158&lt;/ref&gt; In order to bypass the Persian landroute, Justinian established friendly relations with the [[Kingdom of Axum|Abyssinians]], whom he wanted to act as trade mediators by transporting Indian silk to the Empire; the Abyssinians, however, were unable to compete with the Persian merchants in India</span>
