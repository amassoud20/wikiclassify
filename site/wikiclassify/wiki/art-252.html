				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;In a book published in 2011, Bergman's niece Veronica Ralston suggested that the director was not identical to the child born to Erik and Karin Bergman in July 1918</span>
				<span class='text'>Ralston's claim was that this child would have died and been substituted for another child allegedly born to Erik Bergman in an [[Extramarital affair|extramarital relationship]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He grew up with his older brother [[Dag Bergman|Dag]] and sister [[Margareta Bergman|Margareta]] surrounded by religious imagery and discussion</span>
				<span class='text'>His father was a conservative parish minister with strict parenting concepts</span>
				<span class='text'>Ingmar was locked up in dark closets for &quot;infractions&quot;, such as [[Nocturnal enuresis|wetting the bed]]</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;While father preached away in the pulpit and the congregation prayed, sang, or listened&quot;, Ingmar wrote in his autobiography ''Laterna Magica'',&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I devoted my interest to the church's mysterious world of low arches, thick walls, the smell of eternity, the coloured sunlight quivering above the strangest vegetation of medieval paintings and carved figures on ceilings and walls</span>
				<span class='text'>There was everything that one's imagination could desire&amp;nbsp;— angels, saints, dragons, prophets, devils, humans&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/blockquote&gt;Although raised in a devout Lutheran household, Bergman later stated that he lost his faith at age eight and only came to terms with this fact while making ''[[Winter Light]]'' in 1962</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Films of Ingmar Bergman |first=Jesse |last=Kalin |year=2003 |page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bergman’s interest in theatre and film began early: &quot;At the age of nine, he traded a set of tin soldiers for a [[magic lantern]], a possession that altered the course of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>Within a year, he had created, by playing with this toy, a private world in which he felt completely at home, he recalled</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In 1937, he entered Stockholm University College (later renamed [[Stockholm University]]), to study art and literature</span>
				<span class='text'>He spent most of his time involved in student theatre and became a &quot;genuine movie addict&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jerry |last=Vermilye |title=Ingmar Bergman: His Life and Films |year=2001 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, a romantic involvement led to a break with his father that lasted for years</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he did not graduate, he wrote a number of plays, as well as an opera, and became an assistant director at a theatre</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1942, he was given the chance to direct one of his own scripts, ''Caspar’s Death''</span>
				<span class='text'>The play was seen by members of [[AB Svensk Filmindustri|Svensk Filmindustri]], which then offered Bergman a position working on scripts</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1943, he married [[Else Fisher]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Career=====Film work===Bergman’s film career began in 1941 with his rewriting of scripts, but his first major accomplishment was in 1944 when he wrote the screenplay for ''[[Torment (1944 film)|Torment/Frenzy]]'' (''Hets''), a film directed by [[Alf Sjöberg]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Along with writing the screenplay, he was also given position as assistant director to the film</span>
				<span class='text'>In his second autobiographical book, ''Images: My Life in Film'', Bergman describes the filming of the exteriors as his actual film directorial debut</span>

				<span class='text'>ISBN 0-7475-1670-7</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The international success of this film led to Bergman’s first opportunity to direct a year later</span>
				<span class='text'>During the next ten years, he wrote and directed more than a dozen films including ''[[Prison (1949 film)|The Devil’s Wanton/Prison]]'' (''Fängelse'') in 1949 as well as ''[[Sawdust and Tinsel|The Naked Night/Sawdust and Tinsel]]'' (''Gycklarnas afton'') and ''[[Summer with Monika]]'' (''Sommaren med Monika''), both from 1953</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright=1</span>
				<span class='text'>|Ingmar Bergman and [[Victor Sjöström]] on the set of ''[[Wild Strawberries (film)|Wild Strawberries]]'' (1957)]]Bergman first achieved worldwide success with ''[[Smiles of a Summer Night]]'' (''Sommarnattens leende'') (1955), which won for &quot;Best poetic humour&quot; and was nominated for the [[Palme d’Or]] at Cannes the following year</span>
				<span class='text'>This was followed by ''[[The Seventh Seal]]'' (''Det sjunde inseglet'') and ''[[Wild Strawberries (film)|Wild Strawberries]]'' (''Smultronstället''), released in Sweden ten months apart in 1957</span>
				<span class='text'>''The Seventh Seal'' won a special jury prize and was nominated for the Palme d'Or at Cannes and ''Wild Strawberries'' won numerous awards for Bergman and its star, [[Victor Sjöström]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Bergman continued to be productive for the next two decades</span>
				<span class='text'>From the early 1960s, he spent much of his life on the Swedish island of [[Fårö]], where he made several films</span>
				<span class='text'>n the early 1960s he directed three films that explored the theme of faith and doubt in God, ''[[Through a Glass Darkly (film)|Through a Glass Darkly]]'' (''Såsom i en Spegel'', 1961), ''[[Winter Light]]'' (''Nattvardsgästerna'', 1962), and ''[[The Silence (1963 film)|The Silence]]'' (''Tystnaden'', 1963)</span>
				<span class='text'>Critics created the notion that the common themes in these three films made them a [[trilogy]] or cinematic [[triptych]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Bergman initially responded that he did not plan these three films as a trilogy and that he could not see any common motifs in them, but he later seemed to have adopted the notion, with some equivocation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Stated in [[Marie Nyreröd]]’s interview series (the first part named ''Bergman och filmen'') aired on [[Sveriges Television]] Easter 2004</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In contrast, in 1964 Bergman had the three scripts published in a single volume: &quot;These three films deal with reduction</span>
				<span class='text'>''Through a Glass Darkly''&amp;nbsp;– conquered certainty</span>
				<span class='text'>''Winter Light''&amp;nbsp;– penetrated certainty</span>
				<span class='text'>''The Silence''&amp;nbsp;– God’s silence&amp;nbsp;— the negative imprint</span>
				<span class='text'>Therefore, they constitute a trilogy</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; [[The Criterion Collection]] groups the films as a trilogy in a [[boxed set]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In the 1963 documentary ''[[Ingmar Bergman Makes a Movie]]'', about the making of ''Winter Light'', supports the idea that Bergman did not plan a trilogy</span>
				<span class='text'>In the interview with Bergman about writing the script of ''Winter Light'', and the interviews made during the shooting of it, he hardly mentions ''[[Through a Glass Darkly (film)|Through a Glass Darkly]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, he discusses the themes of ''Winter Light'', in particular the religious issues, in relation to ''[[The Virgin Spring]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In 1964 he made a [[parody]] of [[Fellini]] with ''[[All These Women]] ''(''För att inte tala om alla dessa kvinnor'')</span>

				<span class='text'>While the shockingly experimental film won few awards, many consider it his masterpiece</span>
				<span class='text'>Other notable films of the period include ''[[The Virgin Spring]]'' (''Jungfrukällan'', 1960), ''[[Hour of the Wolf]]'' (''Vargtimmen'', 1968), ''[[Shame (1968 film)|Shame]]'' (''Skammen'', 1968) and ''[[The Passion of Anna|A Passion/The Passion of Anna]]'' (''En Passion'', 1969)</span>
				<span class='text'>Bergman also produced extensively for Swedish television at this time</span>
				<span class='text'>Two works of note were ''[[Scenes from a Marriage]]'' (''Scener ur ett äktenskap'', 1973) and ''[[The Magic Flute (1975 film)|The Magic Flute]]'' (''Trollflöjten'', 1975)</span>
				<span class='text'>fter his arrest in 1976 for tax evasion, Bergman swore he would never again make films in Sweden</span>
				<span class='text'>He shut down his film studio on the island of Fårö and went into self-imposed exile</span>
				<span class='text'>He briefly considered the possibility of working in America and his next film, ''[[The Serpent's Egg (film)|The Serpent’s Egg]]'' (1977) was a German-U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>production and his second English-language film (the first being 1971’s ''[[The Touch (1971 film)|The Touch]]'')</span>
				<span class='text'>This was followed a year later with a British-Norwegian co-production of ''[[Autumn Sonata]]'' (''Höstsonaten'', 1978)  starring [[Ingrid Bergman]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The one other film he directed was ''[[From the Life of the Marionettes]]'' (''Aus dem Leben der Marionetten'', 1980) a British-German co-production</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1982, he temporarily returned to his homeland to direct ''[[Fanny and Alexander]]'' (''Fanny och Alexander'')</span>
				<span class='text'>Bergman stated that the film would be his last, and that afterwards he would focus on directing theatre</span>
				<span class='text'>After that he wrote several film scripts and directed a number of television specials</span>
				<span class='text'>As with previous work for TV, some of these productions were later released in theatres</span>
				<span class='text'>The last such work was ''[[Saraband]]'' (2003), a sequel to ''Scenes from a Marriage'' and directed by Bergman when he was 84 years old</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright=1</span>
				<span class='text'>|A great number of Bergman’s interior scenes were filmed at the ''[[Filmstaden]]'' studios north of Stockholm</span>
				<span class='text'>]Bergman developed a personal &quot;repertory company&quot; of Swedish actors whom he repeatedly cast in his films, including [[Max von Sydow]], [[Bibi Andersson]], [[Harriet Andersson]], [[Erland Josephson]], [[Ingrid Thulin]], [[Gunnel Lindblom]], [[Bengt Ekerot]], [[Anders Ek]], and [[Gunnar Björnstrand]], each of whom appeared in at least five Bergman features</span>
				<span class='text'>Norwegian actress [[Liv Ullmann]], who appeared in nine of Bergman’s films and one televisual film (''Saraband''), was the last to join this group (in the 1966 film ''[[Persona (1966 film)|Persona]]''), and ultimately became most closely associated with Bergman, both artistically and personally</span>
				<span class='text'>They had a daughter together, [[Linn Ullmann]] (born 1966)</span>
				<span class='text'>ergman began working with [[Sven Nykvist]], his [[cinematographer]], in 1953</span>
				<span class='text'>The two developed and maintained a working relationship of sufficient rapport to allow Bergman not to worry about the composition of a shot until the day before it was filmed</span>
				<span class='text'>On the morning of the shoot, he would briefly speak to Nykvist about the mood and composition he hoped for, and then leave Nykvist to work, lacking interruption or comment until post-production discussion of the next day’s work</span>
				<span class='text'>===Financing====By Bergman’s own account, he never had a problem with funding</span>
				<span class='text'>He cited two reasons for this: one, that he did not live in the United States, which he viewed as obsessed with box-office earnings; and two, that his films tended to be low-budget affairs</span>
				<span class='text'>(''[[Cries and Whispers]]'', for instance, was finished for about $450,000, while ''[[Scenes from a Marriage]]'', a six-episode television feature, cost only $200,000</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;====Technique====Bergman usually wrote his own screenplays, thinking about them for months or years before starting the actual process of writing, which he viewed as somewhat tedious</span>
				<span class='text'>His earlier films are carefully constructed and are either based on his plays or written in collaboration with other authors</span>
				<span class='text'>Bergman stated that in his later works, when on occasion his actors would want to do things differently from his own intention, he would let them, noting that the results were often &quot;disastrous&quot; when he did not do so</span>
				<span class='text'>As his career progressed, Bergman increasingly let his actors [[improvisation|improvise]] their dialogue</span>
				<span class='text'>In his latest films, he wrote just the ideas informing the scene and allowed his actors to determine the exact dialogue</span>
				<span class='text'>When viewing [[daily rushes]], Bergman stressed the importance of being critical but unemotive, claiming that he asked himself not if the work is great or terrible, but if it is sufficient or if it needs to be reshot</span>

				<span class='text'>While these topics could seem cerebral, sexual desire found its way to the foreground of most of his films, whether the setting was a medieval plague (''[[The Seventh Seal]]''), upper-class family activity in early twentieth century Uppsala (''[[Fanny and Alexander]]'') or contemporary alienation (''[[The Silence (1963 film)|The Silence]]'')</span>

				<span class='text'>During his studies at [[Stockholm University]], he became active in its student theatre, where he made a name for himself early on</span>
				<span class='text'>His first work after graduation was as a trainee-director at a Stockholm theatre</span>

				<span class='text'>He stayed at [[Helsingborg]] for three years and then became the director at [[Gothenburg]] city theatre from 1946 to 1949</span>
				<span class='text'>e became director of the [[Malmö]] city theatre in 1953 and remained for seven years</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of his star actors were people with whom he began working on stage, and a number of people in the &quot;Bergman troupe&quot; of his 1960s films came from Malmö’s city theatre ([[Max von Sydow]], for example)</span>
				<span class='text'>He was the director of the ''[[Royal Dramatic Theatre]]'' in Stockholm from 1960 to 1966 and manager from 1963 to 1966, where he began a long-time collaboration with choreographer [[Donya Feuer]]</span>

				<span class='text'>==Tax evasion charges===On 30 January 1976, while rehearsing [[August Strindberg]]’s ''[[The Dance of Death (Strindberg)|Dance of Death]]'' at the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm, he was arrested by two plainclothes police officers and charged with income tax evasion</span>
				<span class='text'>The impact of the event on Bergman was devastating</span>
				<span class='text'>He suffered a nervous break-down as a result of the humiliation and was hospitalized in a state of deep depression</span>
				<span class='text'>he investigation was focused on an alleged 1970 transaction of 500,000 Swedish kronor (SEK) between Bergman’s Swedish company ''Cinematograf'' and its [[Switzerland|Swiss]] subsidiary ''Persona'', an entity that was mainly used for the paying of salaries to foreign actors</span>
				<span class='text'>Bergman dissolved ''Persona'' in 1974 after having been notified by the Swedish Central Bank and subsequently reported the income</span>
				<span class='text'>On 23 March 1976, the special prosecutor Anders Nordenadler dropped the charges against Bergman, saying that the alleged crime had no legal basis, saying it would be like bringing &quot;charges against a person who has stolen his own car, thinking it was someone else’s&quot;</span>
