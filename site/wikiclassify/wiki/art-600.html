				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; A member of the [[Bagrationi dynasty]], her position as the first woman to rule Georgia in her own right was emphasized by the title ''mep'e'' (&quot;[[king]]&quot;), commonly afforded to Tamar in the medieval Georgian sources</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot; Eastmond-109&quot;/&gt;Tamar was proclaimed heir and co-ruler by her reigning father [[George III of Georgia|George III]] in 1178, but she faced significant opposition from the aristocracy upon her ascension to full ruling powers after George's death</span>
				<span class='text'>Tamar was successful in neutralizing this opposition and embarked on an energetic foreign policy aided by the decline of the hostile [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuq Turks]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Relying on a powerful military élite, Tamar was able to build on the successes of her predecessors to consolidate an empire which dominated the [[Caucasus]] until its collapse under the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] attacks within two decades after Tamar's death</span>

				<span class='text'>For her second consort Tamar chose, in 1191, the [[Alania|Alan]] prince [[David Soslan]], by whom she had two children, [[George IV of Georgia|George]] and [[Rusudan of Georgia|Rusudan]], the two successive monarchs on the throne of Georgia</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Tamar's association with the period of political and military successes and cultural achievements, combined with her role as a female ruler, has led to her idealization and romanticization in Georgian arts and historical memory</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tamar (name)|name Tamar]] is of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] origin and, like other [[Bible|biblical]] names, was favored by the Georgian Bagrationi dynasty because of [[Origin of the Bagratid dynasties|their claim to be descended from David]], the second king of [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Israel]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Tamar's youth coincided with a major upheaval in Georgia; in 1177, her father, George III, was confronted by a rebellious faction of nobles</span>
				<span class='text'>The rebels intended to dethrone George in favor of the king's fraternal nephew, [[Demna of Georgia|Demna]], who was considered by many to be a legitimate royal heir of his murdered father, [[David V of Georgia|David V]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Demna's cause was little but a pretext for the nobles, led by the pretender's father-in-law, the [[amirspasalar]] (&quot;constable&quot;) Ivane Orbeli, to weaken the crown</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Khazanov &amp; Wink (2001), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>48–49</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; George III was able to crush the revolt and embarked on a campaign of crackdown on the defiant aristocratic clans; Ivane Orbeli was put to death and the surviving members of his family were driven out of Georgia</span>
				<span class='text'>Prince Demna, castrated and blinded on his uncle's order, did not survive the mutilation and soon died in prison</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Eastmond (1998), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>106–107</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Once the rebellion was suppressed and the pretender eliminated, George went ahead to co-opt Tamar into government with him and crowned her as co-ruler in 1178</span>
				<span class='text'>By doing so, the king attempted to preempt any dispute after his death and legitimize his line on the throne of Georgia</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Eastmond-108&quot;&gt;Eastmond (1998), p</span>

				<span class='text'>The earliest surviving portrait of Tamar from the church of the [[Dormition of the Theotokos|Dormition]] at Vardzia, c</span>
				<span class='text'>1184–1186]]For six years, Tamar was a co-ruler with her father upon whose death, in 1184, Tamar continued as the sole monarch and was crowned a second time at the [[Gelati Monastery|Gelati cathedral]] near [[Kutaisi]], western Georgia</span>
				<span class='text'>She inherited a relatively strong kingdom, but the centrifugal tendencies fostered by the great nobles were far from being quelled</span>
				<span class='text'>There was a considerable opposition to Tamar's succession; this was sparked by a reaction against the repressive policies of her father and encouraged by the new sovereign's other perceived weakness, her sex</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot; Eastmond-108&quot;/&gt; As Georgia had never previously had a female ruler, a part of the aristocracy questioned Tamar's legitimacy, while others tried to exploit her youth and supposed weakness to assert greater autonomy for themselves</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot; Eastmond-108&quot;/&gt; The energetic involvement of Tamar's influential aunt [[Rusudan, daughter of Demetre I of Georgia|Rusudan]] and the [[Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia|Georgian catholicos]] Michael IV Mirianisdze was crucial for legitimizing Tamar's succession to the throne</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lordkipanidze (1987), p</span>
				<span class='text'>135</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; However, the young queen was forced into making significant concessions to the aristocracy</span>
				<span class='text'>She had to reward the catholicos Michael's support by making him a [[chancellor]], thus placing him at the top of both the clerical and secular hierarchies</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Suny-39&quot;&gt;Suny (1994), p</span>
				<span class='text'>39</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Tamar was also pressured into dismissing her father's appointees, among them the constable Qubasar (ყუბასარი), a [[Kipchaks in Georgia|Georgian Kipchak]] of ignoble birth, who had helped George III in his crackdown on the defiant nobility</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Khazanov-49&quot;/&gt; One of the few untitled servitors of George III to escape this fate was the [[treasurer]] [[Qutlu Arslan]] who now led a group of nobles and wealthy citizens in a struggle to limit the royal authority by creating a new council, ''karavi'', whose members would alone deliberate and decide policy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Suny-39&quot;/&gt; This attempt at &quot;feudal [[constitutionalism]]&quot; was rendered abortive when Tamar had Qutlu Arslan arrested and his supporters were inveigled into submission</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Khazanov-49&quot;/&gt; Yet, Tamar’s first moves to reduce the power of the aristocratic élite were unsuccessful</span>
				<span class='text'>She failed in her attempt to use a church [[synod]] to dismiss the catholicos Michael, and the noble council, ''darbazi'', asserted the right to approve royal decrees</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Suny-39&quot;/&gt; Even the queen’s first husband, the [[Rus' (people)|Rus']] prince [[Yuri Bogolyubsky|Yuri]], was forced on her by the nobles</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Suny-39&quot;/&gt;Pursuant to dynastic imperatives and the ethos of the time, the nobles required Tamar to marry in order to have a leader for the army and to provide an heir to the throne</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;eastmond-94&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Khazanov-49&quot;/&gt; Their choice fell on Yuri, son of the murdered prince [[Andrei I Bogolyubsky]] of [[Vladimir-Suzdal]], who then lived as a refugee among the [[Kipchaks]] of the [[North Caucasus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The choice was approved by Tamar’s aunt Rusudan and the prince was brought to Georgia to marry the queen in 1185</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lordkipanidze (1987), p</span>
				<span class='text'>141</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Yuri proved to be an able soldier, but a difficult person and he soon ran afoul of his wife</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;eastmond-94&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Khazanov-49&quot;/&gt; The strained spousal relations paralleled a factional struggle at the royal court in which Tamar was becoming more and more assertive of her rights as a queen regnant</span>

				<span class='text'>142</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The turning point in Tamar's fortunes came with the death of the powerful catholicos Michael whom the queen replaced, as a chancellor, with her supporter, Anton Gnolistavisdze</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Lordkipanidze-142&quot;/&gt; Tamar gradually expanded her own power base and elevated her loyal nobles to high positions at the court, most notably the Kurdish family, known in Georgia as the Mkhargrdzeli</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|150px|right|Tamar as depicted on a 13th-century mural from the [[Kintsvisi Monastery|Kintsvisi monastery]]]]In 1187, Tamar persuaded the noble council to approve her to divorce Yuri, who was accused of addiction to drunkenness and &quot;[[sodomy]]&quot; and was sent off to [[Constantinople]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Lordkipanidze-142&quot;/&gt; Assisted by several Georgian aristocrats anxious to check Tamar’s growing power, Yuri made two attempts at coup, but failed and went off to obscurity after 1191</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Khazanov-49&quot;/&gt; The queen chose her second husband herself</span>
				<span class='text'>He was [[David Soslan]], an [[Alania|Alan]] prince, to whom the 18th-century Georgian scholar Prince [[Vakhushti]] ascribes descent from the early 11th-century Georgian king [[George I of Georgia|George I]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Alemany (2000), p</span>
				<span class='text'>321</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; David, a capable military commander, became Tamar's major supporter and was instrumental in defeating the rebellious nobles rallied behind Yuri</span>

				<span class='text'>143</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Tamar and David had two children</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1192 or 1194, the queen gave birth to a son, George-Lasha, the future king [[George IV of Georgia|George IV]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The daughter, [[Rusudan of Georgia|Rusudan]], was born {{circa}} 1195 and would succeed her brother as a sovereign of Georgia</span>

				<span class='text'>111–112</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;David Soslan's status of a [[king consort]], as well as his presence in art, on charters, and on coins, was dictated by the necessity of male aspects of kingship, but he remained a subordinate ruler who shared throne with and derived his power from Tamar</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Lordkipanidze-143&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eastmond (1998), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>135–137</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Tamar continued to be styled as ''mep’et’a mep’e''&amp;nbsp;– &quot;[[king of kings]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>In Georgian, a language with no [[grammatical gender]]s, ''mep'e'' (&quot;king&quot;) does not necessarily imply a masculine connotation and can be rendered as a &quot;sovereign&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Rapp (2003), p</span>
				<span class='text'>263</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Eastmond-109&quot;&gt;Eastmond (1998), p</span>
				<span class='text'>109</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The female equivalent of ''mep'e'' is ''dedop'ali'' (&quot;queen&quot;), which was applied to [[Queen consort|queens consort]] or the king's closest, senior female relatives</span>
				<span class='text'>Tamar is occasionally called ''dedop'ali'' in the Georgian chronicles and on some charters</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, the title of ''mep'e'' might have been applied to Tamar to mark out her unique position among women</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|The ruined cave-town of Vardzia]]Once Tamar succeeded in consolidating her power and found a reliable support in David Soslan, the Mkhargrdzeli, [[Toreli]], and other noble families, she revived the expansionist foreign policy of her predecessors</span>
				<span class='text'>Repeated occasions of dynastic strife in Georgia combined with the efforts of regional successors of the [[Great Seljuq Empire]], such as the Ildenizid [[atabegs of Azerbaijan]], [[Shirvanshah]]s, and the [[Ahlatshahs]], had slowed down the dynamic of the Georgians achieved during the reigns of Tamar's great-grandfather, [[David IV of Georgia|David IV]], and her father, George III</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the Georgians became again active under Tamar, more prominently in the second decade of her rule</span>
				<span class='text'>arly in the 1190s, the Georgian government began to interfere in the affairs of the Ildenizids and of the Shirvanshahs, aiding rivaling local princes and reducing [[Shirvan]] to a tributary state</span>
				<span class='text'>The Ildenizid atabeg Abu Bakr attempted to stem the Georgian advance, but suffered a defeat at the hands of David Soslan at [[Battle of Shamkor|Shamkir]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Suny-39&quot;/&gt; and lost his capital to a Georgian protégé in 1195</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Abu Bakr was able to resume his reign a year later, the Ildenizids were only barely able to contain further Georgian forays</span>

				<span class='text'>From their base at Ani, the brothers surged ahead into the central Armenian lands, reclaiming one after another fortress and district from local Muslim dynasts: [[Bjni]] was taken in 1201 and [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]] fell in 1203</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Lordkipanidze-154&quot;/&gt; In a great final burst, the brothers led an army marshaled throughout Tamar's possessions and vassal territories in a march, through [[Nakhchivan (city)|Nakhchivan]] and [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (city)|Julfa]], to [[Marand]], [[Tabriz]], and [[Qazvin]] in northwest [[Iran]], pillaging several settlements on their way</span>

				<span class='text'>This state was established by [[Alexios I of Trebizond|Alexios Megas Komnenos]] and his brother, [[David Komnenos|David]], in the northeastern&amp;nbsp;– [[Pontus|Pontic]]&amp;nbsp;– provinces of the crumbling [[Byzantine Empire]] with the aid of Georgian troops</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; were fugitive Byzantine princes raised at the Georgian court</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Tamar's historian, the aim of the Georgian expedition to Trebizond was to punish the Byzantine emperor [[Alexios IV Angelos]] for his confiscation of a shipment of money from the Georgian queen to the monasteries of [[Antioch]] and [[Mount Athos]]</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Tamar's Pontic endeavor can better be explained by her desire to take advantage of the [[Western Europe]]an [[Fourth Crusade]] against Constantinople to set up a friendly state in Georgia's immediate southwestern neighborhood, as well as by the dynastic solidarity to the dispossessed [[Komnenos|Komnenoi]]</span>

				<span class='text'>n Georgian literature, Tamar was also romanticized, but very differently from the Russian and Western European view</span>
				<span class='text'>The Georgian romanticists followed a medieval tradition in Tamar's portrayal as a gentle, saintly woman who ruled a country permanently at war</span>
				<span class='text'>This sentiment was further inspired by the rediscovery of a contemporary, 13th-century wall painting of Tamar in the then-ruined [[Betania monastery]], which was uncovered and restored by Prince [[Grigory Gagarin]] in the 1840s</span>
				<span class='text'>The fresco became a source of numerous engravings circulating in Georgia at that time and inspired the poet [[Grigol Orbeliani]] to dedicate a romantic poem to it</span>
				<span class='text'>Furthermore, the Georgian literati, reacting to the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] rule in Georgia and the suppression of national institutions, contrasted Tamar's era to their contemporary situation, lamenting the irretrievably lost past in their writings</span>
				<span class='text'>Hence, Tamar became a personification of the heyday of Georgia, a perception that has persisted down to the present time</span>

				<span class='text'>[[Shalva Dadiani]]'s play, originally entitled ''The Unfortunate Russian'' (უბედური რუსი; 1916–1926), was attacked by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] critics for distorting the &quot;centuries-long friendship of the Russian and Georgian peoples</span>
