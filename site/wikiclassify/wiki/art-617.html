				<span class='text'>tml Michelangelo Antonioni Biography (1912?-)]&lt;/ref&gt; The director explained to Italian film critic Aldo Tassone:{{quote|My childhood was a happy one</span>
				<span class='text'>My mother&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>was a warm and intelligent woman who had been a labourer in her youth</span>
				<span class='text'>My father also was a good man</span>
				<span class='text'>Born into a working-class family, he succeeded in obtaining a comfortable position through evening courses and hard work</span>
				<span class='text'>My parents gave me free rein to do what I wanted: with my brother, we spent most of our time playing outside with friends</span>
				<span class='text'>Curiously enough, our friends were invariably proletarian, and poor</span>
				<span class='text'>The poor still existed at that time, you recognized them by their clothes</span>
				<span class='text'>But even in the way they wore their clothes, there was a fantasy, a frankness that made me prefer them to boys of bourgeois families</span>
				<span class='text'>I always had sympathy for young women of working-class families, even later when I attended university: they were more authentic and spontaneous</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tassone, 6&lt;/ref&gt;}}While still a child, Antonioni was fond of drawing and music</span>
				<span class='text'>A precocious violinist, he gave his first concert at the age of nine</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he abandoned the violin with the discovery of cinema in his teens, drawing would remain a lifelong passion</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;I have never drawn, even as a child, either puppets or silhouettes but rather facades of houses and gates</span>
				<span class='text'>One of my favourite games consisted of organising towns</span>
				<span class='text'>Ignorant in architecture, I constructed buildings and streets crammed with little figures</span>
				<span class='text'>I invented stories for them</span>
				<span class='text'>These childhood ''happenings'' - I was eleven years old - were like little films</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tassone, 7&lt;/ref&gt;Upon graduation from the [[University of Bologna]] with a degree in [[economics]], he started writing for the local Ferrara newspaper ''Il Corriere Padano'' in 1935 as a film journalist</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1940, Antonioni moved to Rome, where he worked for ''Cinema'', the official [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] film magazine edited by [[Vittorio Mussolini]]</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Antonioni was fired a few months afterward</span>
				<span class='text'>Later that year he enrolled at the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia to study film technique, but left it after three months</span>
				<span class='text'>He was drafted into the army afterwards</span>
				<span class='text'>During the war Antonioni survived being condemned to death for his membership in the resistance</span>

				<span class='text'>Antonioni lay in state at City Hall in Rome where a large screen showed black-and-white footage of him among his film sets and behind-the-scenes</span>
				<span class='text'>He was buried in his home town of Ferrara on 2 August 2007</span>
				<span class='text'>=Career=====Early film work===In 1942, Antonioni co-wrote ''[[A Pilot Returns]]'' with [[Roberto Rossellini]] and worked as assistant director on Enrico Fulchignoni's ''I due Foscari''</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1943, he travelled to France to assist [[Marcel Carné]] on ''[[Les visiteurs du soir]]'' and then began a series of [[short film]]s with ''Gente del Po'' (1943), a story of poor fishermen of the [[Po valley]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After the Liberation, the film stock was stored in the East-Italian Fascist &quot;[[Italian Social Republic|Republic of Salò]]&quot; and could not be recovered and edited until 1947 (the complete footage was never retrieved)</span>
				<span class='text'>These films were [[Italian neorealism|neorealist]] in style, being semi-[[Documentary film|documentary]] studies of the lives of ordinary people</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;cook&quot;&gt;Cook, 535&lt;/ref&gt;However, Antonioni's first full-length feature film ''[[Cronaca di un amore]]'' (1950) broke away from neorealism by depicting the middle classes</span>
				<span class='text'>He continued to do so in a series of other films: ''[[I vinti]]'' (&quot;The Vanquished&quot;, 1952), a trio of stories, each set in a different country (France, Italy and England), about juvenile delinquency; ''[[La signora senza camelie]]'' (''The Lady Without Camellias'', 1953) about a young film star and her fall from grace; and ''[[Le amiche]]'' (''The Girlfriends'', 1955) about middle class women in Turin</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[Il grido]]'' (''The Outcry'', 1957) was a return to working class stories, depicting a factory worker and his daughter</span>
				<span class='text'>Each of these stories is about [[social alienation]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;cook&quot;/&gt;===International recognition===In ''Le Amiche'' (1955), Antonioni experimented with a radical new style: instead of a conventional narrative, he presented a series of apparently disconnected events, and he used [[long take]]s as part of his film making style</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;cook&quot;/&gt; Antonioni returned to their use in ''[[L'avventura]]'' (1960), which became his first international success</span>

				<span class='text'>44, Schellerten 2014, ISBN 978-3-88842-044-3&lt;/ref&gt; set in [[Swinging London]], was a major international success</span>
				<span class='text'>The script was loosely based on the short story ''The Devil's Drool'' (otherwise known as ''Blow Up'') by Argentinian writer [[Julio Cortázar]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Although it dealt with the challenging theme of the impossibility of objective standards and the ever-doubtable truth of memory, it was a successful and popular hit with audiences, no doubt helped by its sex scenes, which were explicit for the time</span>
				<span class='text'>It starred [[David Hemmings]] and [[Vanessa Redgrave]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The second film was ''[[Zabriskie Point (film)|Zabriskie Point]]'' (1970), his first set in America and with a [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] theme</span>
				<span class='text'>The soundtrack carried popular artists such as [[Pink Floyd]] (who wrote new music specifically for the film), the [[Grateful Dead]] and the [[Rolling Stones]]</span>
				<span class='text'>However, its release was a critical and commercial disaster</span>
				<span class='text'>The third, ''[[The Passenger (1975 film)|The Passenger]]'' (1975), starring [[Jack Nicholson]] and [[Maria Schneider (actor)|Maria Schneider]], received critical praise, but also did poorly at the box office</span>
				<span class='text'>It was out of circulation for many years, but was re-released for a limited theatrical run in October 2005 and has subsequently been released on [[DVD]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1972, in between ''Zabriskie Point'' and ''The Passenger'', Antonioni was invited by the [[Mao Zedong|Mao]] government of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] to visit the country</span>
				<span class='text'>He made the documentary ''[[Chung Kuo, Cina]]'', but it was severely denounced by the Chinese authorities as &quot;anti-Chinese&quot; and &quot;anti-communist&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>It is based on [[Jean Cocteau]]'s play ''[[L'Aigle à deux têtes]]'' (''The Eagle With Two Heads'')</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[Identificazione di una donna]]'' (''Identification of a Woman'', 1982), filmed in Italy, deals one more time with the recursive subjects of his Italian trilogy</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1985, Antonioni suffered a stroke, which left him partly paralyzed and unable to speak</span>
				<span class='text'>However, he continued to make films, including ''[[Beyond the Clouds (1995 film)|Beyond the Clouds]]'' (1995), for which [[Wim Wenders]] filmed some scenes</span>
				<span class='text'>As Wenders has explained, Antonioni rejected almost all the material filmed by Wenders during the editing, except for a few short interludes</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wenders, 79&lt;/ref&gt; They shared the FIPRESCI Prize at the [[Venice Film Festival]] with ''[[Cyclo (film)|Cyclo]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1994 he was given the Honorary [[Academy Award]] &quot;in recognition of his place as one of the cinema's master visual stylists</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; It was presented to him by [[Jack Nicholson]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Months later, the statuette was stolen by burglars and had to be replaced</span>
				<span class='text'>Previously, he had been nominated for [[Academy Award]]s for Best Director and Best Screenplay for ''[[Blowup]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Antonioni's final film, made when he was in his 90s, was a segment of the [[anthology film]] ''[[Eros (film)|Eros]]'' (2004), entitled &quot;Il filo pericoloso delle cose&quot; (&quot;The Dangerous Thread of Things&quot;)</span>

				<span class='text'>=Reception==Film historian Virginia Wright Wexman describes Antonioni's perspective on the world as that of a &quot;[[irreligion|postreligious]] [[Marxism|Marxist]] and [[existentialist]] intellectual</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wexman&quot;&gt;Wexman, 312</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In a speech at Cannes about ''L'Avventura'', Antonioni said that in the modern age of reason and science, mankind still lives by &quot;a rigid and stereotyped morality which all of us recognize as such and yet sustain out of cowardice and sheer laziness&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He said his films explore the paradox that &quot;we have examined those moral attitudes very carefully, we have dissected them and analyzed them to the point of exhaustion</span>
				<span class='text'>We have been capable of all this, but we have not been capable of finding new ones</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; {{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Nine years later he expressed a similar attitude in an interview, saying that he loathed the word 'morality': &quot;When man becomes reconciled to nature, when space becomes his true background, these words and concepts will have lost their meaning, and we will no longer have to use them</span>

				<span class='text'>Samuels, 15-32</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;One of the recurring themes in Antonioni's films is characters who suffer from [[wiktionary:ennui|ennui]] and whose lives are empty and purposeless aside from the gratification of pleasure or the pursuit of material wealth</span>
				<span class='text'>Film historian [[David Bordwell]] writes that in his films, &quot;Vacations, parties and artistic pursuits are vain efforts to conceal the characters' lack of purpose and emotion</span>
				<span class='text'>Sexuality is reduced to casual seduction, enterprise to the pursuit of wealth at any cost</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bordwell&quot;&gt;Bordwell and Thompson, 427-428</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Antonioni's films tend to have spare plots and dialogue, and much of the screen time is spent lingering on certain settings, such as the seven-minute [[long take|continuous take]] at the end of ''The Passenger'' and the beautiful long-take near the beginning that &quot;mixes time&quot;, or the scene in ''L'Eclisse'' in which Monica Vitti stares curiously at electrical posts accompanied by ambient sounds of wires clanking</span>
				<span class='text'>Virginia Wright Wexman summarizes his style in the following terms: &quot;The camera is placed at a medium distance more often than close in, frequently moving slowly; the shots are permitted to extend uninterrupted by cutting</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus each image is more complex, containing more information than it would in a style in which a smaller area is framed&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>In Antonioni's work we must regard his images at length; he forces our full attention by continuing the shot long after others would cut away</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wexman&quot;/&gt; Antonioni is also noted for exploiting colour as a significant expressive element of his cinematic style, especially in ''[[Il deserto rosso]]'', his first [[colour film]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[Jancsó, Miklós: ''A Mester lebegve érkezik (Michelangelo Antonioni)'' in: ''Filmvilág'' 2007/10</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt;Antonioni's spare style and purposeless characters, however, have not received universal acclaim</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Ingmar Bergman]] stated in 2002 that he considered some of Antonioni's films, including  ''[[Blowup]]'' and ''[[La notte]]'', masterpieces for their detached and dreamlike quality, but found the other films boring and noted that he had never understood why Antonioni was held in such esteem</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; [[Orson Welles]] regretted the Italian director's use of the [[long take]]: &quot;I don't like to dwell on things</span>
				<span class='text'>It's one of the reasons I'm so bored with Antonioni - the belief that, because a shot is good, it's going to get better if you keep looking at it</span>
				<span class='text'>He gives you a full shot of somebody walking down a road</span>
				<span class='text'>And you think, 'Well, he's not going to carry that woman all the way up that road</span>
				<span class='text'> But he ''does''</span>
				<span class='text'>And then she leaves and you go on looking at the road after she's gone</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bogdanovich&quot;&gt;Bogdanovich, 103-104&lt;/ref&gt;American actor [[Peter Weller]], whom Antonioni directed in ''[[Beyond the Clouds (1995 film)|Beyond the Clouds]]'', explained in a 1996 interview: &quot;There is no director living except maybe [[Akira Kurosawa|Kurosawa]], [[Ingmar Bergman|Bergman]], or Antonioni that I would fall down and do anything for</span>
				<span class='text'>I met Antonioni three years ago in [[Taormina]] at a [[Taormina Film Fest|film festival]]</span>
				<span class='text'>I introduced myself and told him that I adored his movies, his contributions to film, because he was the first guy who really started making films about the reality of the vacuity between people, the difficulty in traversing this space between lovers in modern day&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>and he never gives you an answer, Antonioni – that's the beautiful thing</span>
