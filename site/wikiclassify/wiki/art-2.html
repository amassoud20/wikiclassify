				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Works of this period included important novels on the dehumanising aspects of scientific progress, most famously ''[[Brave New World]]'', and on pacifist themes (for example, ''[[Eyeless in Gaza (novel)|Eyeless in Gaza]]'')</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1938, Huxley befriended [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], whose teachings he greatly admired</span>
				<span class='text'>He also became a Vedantist in the circle of Hindu [[Swami Prabhavananda]], and introduced [[Christopher Isherwood]] to this circle</span>
				<span class='text'>Not long after, Huxley wrote his book on widely held spiritual values and ideas, ''[[The Perennial Philosophy]]'', which discussed the teachings of renowned mystics of the world</span>
				<span class='text'>Huxley's book affirmed a sensibility that insists there are realities beyond the generally accepted &quot;five senses&quot; and that there is genuine meaning for humans beyond both sensual satisfactions and sentimentalities</span>
				<span class='text'>uxley became a close friend of Remsen Bird, president of [[Occidental College]]</span>

				<span class='text'>The college appears as &quot;Tarzana College&quot; in his satirical novel ''[[After Many a Summer]]'' (1939)</span>

				<span class='text'>uring this period, Huxley earned a substantial income as a Hollywood screenwriter; [[Christopher Isherwood]], in his autobiography ''[[My Guru and His Disciple]]'', states that Huxley earned more than $3,000 per week (an enormous sum in those days) as a screenwriter, and that he used much of it to transport Jewish and left-wing writer and artist refugees from Hitler's Germany to the U</span>

				<span class='text'>In March 1938, his friend [[Anita Loos]], a novelist and screenwriter, put him in touch with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] who hired Huxley for ''[[Madame Curie (film)|Madame Curie]]'', which was originally to star [[Greta Garbo]] and be directed by [[George Cukor]]</span>
				<span class='text'>(Eventually, the film was completed by MGM in 1943 with a different director and cast</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;On 21 October 1949, Huxley wrote to [[George Orwell]], author of ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', congratulating him on &quot;how fine and how profoundly important the book is&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>In his letter to Orwell, he predicted:{{Quote | Within the next generation I believe that the world's leaders will discover that infant conditioning and narco-hypnosis are more efficient, as instruments of government, than clubs and prisons, and that the lust for power can be just as completely satisfied by suggesting people into loving their servitude as by flogging them and kicking them into obedience</span>

				<span class='text'>From these, he made some warnings in his writings and talks</span>
				<span class='text'>In a 1958 televised interview conducted by journalist [[Mike Wallace]], Huxley outlined several major concerns: the difficulties and dangers of world overpopulation; the tendency toward distinctly hierarchical social organisation; the crucial importance of evaluating the use of technology in mass societies susceptible to wily persuasion; the tendency to promote modern politicians, to a naive public, as well-marketed commodities</span>

				<span class='text'>The book contained some generally disputed theories, and its publication created a growing degree of popular controversy about Huxley's eyesight</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=February 2015}}It was, and is, widely believed that Huxley was nearly blind since the illness in his teens, despite the partial recovery that had enabled him to study at Oxford</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, some ten years after publication of ''The Art of Seeing'', in 1952, [[Bennett Cerf]] was present when Huxley spoke at a Hollywood banquet, wearing no glasses and apparently reading his paper from the lectern without difficulty: &quot;Then suddenly he faltered — and the disturbing truth became obvious</span>
				<span class='text'>He wasn't reading his address at all</span>
				<span class='text'>He had learned it by heart</span>
				<span class='text'>To refresh his memory he brought the paper closer and closer to his eyes</span>
				<span class='text'>When it was only an inch or so away he still couldn't read it, and had to fish for a magnifying glass in his pocket to make the typing visible to him</span>
				<span class='text'>It was an agonising moment</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gardner&quot;&gt;Cerf, Bennett (12 April 1952), ''The Saturday Review'' (column), quoted in {{cite book |last=Gardner |first=Martin | authorlink =Martin Gardner |title=[[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]] |year=1957 |publisher=Dover Publications |isbn = 978-0-486-20394-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;On the other hand, Huxley's second wife, [[Laura Huxley|Laura Archera Huxley]], would later emphasise in her biographical account, ''This Timeless Moment'': &quot;One of the great achievements of his life: that of having regained his sight</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; After revealing a letter she wrote to the ''Los Angeles Times'' disclaiming the label of Huxley as a &quot;poor fellow who can hardly see&quot; by [[Walter C</span>
				<span class='text'>Alvarez]], she tempered this: &quot;Although I feel it was an injustice to treat Aldous as though he were blind, it is true there were many indications of his impaired vision</span>
				<span class='text'>For instance, although Aldous did not wear glasses, he would quite often use a magnifying lens</span>

				<span class='text'>Her account, in this respect, is discernibly congruent with the following sample of Huxley's own words from ''The Art of Seeing'': &quot;The most characteristic fact about the functioning of the total organism, or any part of the organism, is that it is not constant, but highly variable</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Nevertheless, the topic of Huxley's eyesight continues to endure similar, significant controversy, regardless of how trivial a subject matter it might initially appear</span>

				<span class='text'>Words, even the pregnant words of poets, do not evoke pictures in my mind</span>
