				<span class='text'>About 1939 Huxley encountered the  for better eyesight and a teacher  who was able to teach the method to him</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1940 Huxley relocated from Hollywood to a  ranchito in the high desert hamlet of  in northernmost Los Angeles County</span>
				<span class='text'>Huxley then said that his sight improved dramatically with the Bates Method and the extreme and pure natural lighting of the southwestern American desert</span>
				<span class='text'>He reported that for the first time in more than 25 years he was able to read without glasses and without strain</span>
				<span class='text'>He even tried driving a car along the dirt road beside the ranch</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote a book about his successes with the Bates Method  which was published in 1942 U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>1943 UK</span>
				<span class='text'>The book contained some generally disputed theories and its publication created a growing degree of popular controversy about Huxleys eyesight</span>
				<span class='text'>t was and is widely believed that Huxley was nearly blind since the illness in his teens despite the partial recovery that had enabled him to study at Oxford</span>
				<span class='text'>For example some ten years after publication of The Art of Seeing in 1952  was present when Huxley spoke at a Hollywood banquet wearing no glasses and apparently reading his paper from the lectern without difficulty Then suddenly he faltered — and the disturbing truth became obvious</span>
				<span class='text'>He wasnt reading his address at all</span>
				<span class='text'>He had learned it by heart</span>
				<span class='text'>To resh his memory he brought the paper closer and closer to his eyes</span>
				<span class='text'>When it was only an inch or so away he still couldnt read it and had to fish for a magnifying glass in his pocket to make the typing visible to him</span>
				<span class='text'>It was an agonising moment</span>
				<span class='text'>name GardnerCerf Bennett 12 April 1952 The Saturday Review column quoted in  On the other hand Huxleys second wife  would later emphasise in her biographical account This Timeless Moment One of the great achievements of his life that of having regained his sight</span>
				<span class='text'>After revealing a letter she wrote to the Los Angeles Times disclaiming the label of Huxley as a poor fellow who can hardly see by  she tempered this Although I feel it was an injustice to treat Aldous as though he were blind it is true there were many indications of his impaired vision</span>
				<span class='text'>For instance although Aldous did not wear glasses he would quite often use a magnifying lens</span>
				<span class='text'>name   Huxley  Laura Huxley proceeded to elaborate a few nuances of inconsistency peculiar to Huxleys vision</span>
				<span class='text'>Her account in this respect is discernibly congruent with the following sample of Huxleys own words from The Art of Seeing The most characteristic fact about the functioning of the total organism or any part of the organism is that it is not constant but highly variable</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless the topic of Huxleys eyesight continues to endure similar significant controversy regardless of how trivial a subject matter it might initially appear</span>
