				<span class='text'>quot; They then played a history of jazz, starting with a Dixieland quartet performing &quot;Sensation Rag&quot;, originally recorded by the [[Original Dixieland Jazz Band]] in 1918</span>
				<span class='text'>Once again, initial crowd reaction, though polite, was tepid</span>
				<span class='text'> Then came a jam session on &quot;Honeysuckle Rose&quot; featuring members of the [[Count Basie]] and [[Duke Ellington]] bands as guests</span>
				<span class='text'>(The surprise of the session: Goodman handing a solo to Basie's guitarist [[Freddie Green]] who was never a featured soloist but earned his reputation as the best rhythm guitarist in the genre—he responded with a striking round of chord improvisations</span>

				<span class='text'>&quot;Used to just playing rhythm on the tune, he was unprepared for a turn in the spotlight, but what came out of his fingers was a graceful, impressionistic marvel with classical flourishes, yet still managed to swing</span>

				<span class='text'>581, with the [[Budapest Quartet]]</span>

				<span class='text'>They played chamber music together ([[Brahms]], [[Milhaud]], [[Hindemith]], [[Debussy]]) and in 1948 Goodman played in the world premiere performance of Dahl's ''Concerto a Tre''</span>

				<span class='text'>To do so, he had to change his entire technique: instead of holding the mouthpiece between his front teeth and lower lip, as he had done since he first took a clarinet in hand 30 years earlier, Goodman learned to adjust his embouchure to the use of both lips and even to use new fingering techniques</span>
				<span class='text'>He had his old finger calluses removed and started to learn how to play his clarinet again—almost from scratch</span>

				<span class='text'>In the Southern states, [[racial segregation]] was enforced by the [[Jim Crow laws]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Benny Goodman broke with tradition by hiring [[Teddy Wilson]] to play with him and drummer [[Gene Krupa]] in the Benny Goodman Trio</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1936, he added [[Lionel Hampton]] on vibes to form the Benny Goodman [[Quartet]]; in 1939 he added pioneering jazz guitarist [[Charlie Christian]] to his band and small ensembles, who played with him until his death from tuberculosis less than three years later</span>
				<span class='text'>This integration in music happened ten years before [[Jackie Robinson]] became the first black American to enter [[Major League Baseball]]</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;[Goodman's] popularity was such that he could remain financially viable without touring the South, where he would have been subject to arrest for violating Jim Crow laws</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; According to ''[[Jazz (TV series)|Jazz]]'' by [[Ken Burns]], when someone asked him why he &quot;played with that [[nigger]]&quot; (referring to [[Teddy Wilson]]), Goodman replied, &quot;I'll knock you out if you use that word around me again&quot;</span>
