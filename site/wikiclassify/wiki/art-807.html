				<span class='text'>quot;Puyi's [[wet nurse]], Wen-Chao Wang, was the only one who could console him, and therefore she accompanied him to the [[Forbidden City]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pu Yi 1988, p 136&lt;/ref&gt; His own brother, [[Pujie]], was rumored to steal treasures and art collections and sell to wealthy collectors in the black market</span>

				<span class='text'>they were not real wives and were only there for show}};In detail:In 1921, it was decided by the Dowager Consorts (the four widows of the emperors before Puyi) that it was time for the 15-year-old Puyi to be married, although court politics dragged the complete process (from selecting the bride, up through the wedding ceremony) out for almost two years</span>
				<span class='text'>Puyi saw marriage as his coming of age benchmark, when others would no longer control him</span>
				<span class='text'>He was given four photographs to choose from</span>
				<span class='text'>Puyi stated they all looked alike to him, with the exception of different clothing</span>
				<span class='text'>He chose Wenxiu</span>

				<span class='text'>Her father, Rong Yuan (榮源), was a Minister of Domestic Affairs</span>
				<span class='text'>She was considered beautiful and came from a wealthy family</span>
				<span class='text'>By Puyi's own account, he abandoned Wanrong in the bridal chamber and went back to his own room</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pu Yi 1988, pp 117–121&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained that she was willing to be a wife in name only, in order to carry the title of Empress</span>
				<span class='text'>The couple's relationship was good initially, and Puyi showed preference over Wenxiu for Wanrong and displayed trust in her</span>
				<span class='text'>However, after Wenxiu left in 1931, Puyi blamed Wanrong and stopped speaking to her and ignored her presence</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Henry Pu Yi&quot;/&gt; In his autobiography, Puyi stated her reason for the divorce was the emptiness of life with him in exile, her desire for an ordinary family life, and his own inability to see women as anything but slaves and tools of men</span>
