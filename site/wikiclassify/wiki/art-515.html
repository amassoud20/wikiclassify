				<span class='text'>He helped build the case for the annulment of Henry's marriage to [[Catherine of Aragon]], which was one of the causes of the separation of the English Church from union with the [[Holy See]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Along with [[Thomas Cromwell]], he supported the principle of [[Acts of Supremacy|Royal Supremacy]], in which the king was considered sovereign over the Church within his realm</span>
				<span class='text'>uring Cranmer's tenure as Archbishop of Canterbury, he was responsible for establishing the first doctrinal and liturgical structures of the reformed [[Church of England]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Under Henry's rule, Cranmer did not make many radical changes in the Church, due to power struggles between religious conservatives and reformers</span>
				<span class='text'>However, he succeeded in publishing the first officially authorised [[vernacular]] service, the ''[[Exhortation and Litany (1544)|Exhortation and Litany]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>hen Edward came to the throne, Cranmer was able to promote major reforms</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote and compiled the first two editions of the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'', a complete liturgy for the English Church</span>
				<span class='text'>With the assistance of several Continental reformers to whom he gave refuge, he changed doctrine in areas such as the [[Eucharist]], [[clerical celibacy]], the role of [[Religious image|images]] in places of worship, and the [[Veneration|veneration of saints]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Cranmer [[wikt:promulgate|promulgated]] the new doctrines through the Prayer Book, the ''[[The Books of Homilies|Homilies]]'' and other publications</span>
				<span class='text'>fter the accession of the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] Mary I, Cranmer was put on trial for treason and [[heresy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Imprisoned for over two years and under pressure from Church authorities, he made several [[recantation]]s and apparently reconciled himself with the Roman Catholic Church</span>
				<span class='text'>However, on the day of his execution, he withdrew his recantations, to die a heretic to Roman Catholics and a [[martyr]] for the principles of the English Reformation</span>
				<span class='text'>Cranmer's death was immortalised in ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs]]'' and his legacy lives on within the Church of England through the ''Book of Common Prayer'' and the ''[[Thirty-Nine Articles]]'', an [[Anglican]] statement of faith derived from his work</span>
				<span class='text'>=Early years (1489–1527)==Cranmer was born in 1489 in [[Aslockton]] in [[Nottinghamshire]], England</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ridley|1962|p=13}}</span>
				<span class='text'>The only authority for the date of his birth (2 July) is, according to Ridley, an anonymous biographer who wrote shortly after Cranmer’s death</span>
				<span class='text'>The biographer makes several mistakes about Cranmer’s early life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; His parents, Thomas and Agnes (''née'' Hatfield) Cranmer, were of modest wealth and were not members of the aristocracy</span>
				<span class='text'>Their oldest son, John, inherited the family estate, whereas Thomas and his younger brother Edmund were placed on the path to a clerical career</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today historians know nothing definite about Cranmer’s early schooling</span>
				<span class='text'>He probably attended a grammar school in his village</span>
				<span class='text'>At the age of fourteen, two years after the death of his father, he was sent to the newly created [[Jesus College, Cambridge]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ridley|1962|pp=13–15}}; {{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=7–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took him a surprisingly long eight years to reach his Bachelor of Arts degree following a curriculum of logic, classical literature and philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>During this time, he began to collect medieval [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] books, which he preserved faithfully throughout his life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Selwyn|1993|pp=63–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his master's degree he took a different course of study, concentrating on the [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]], [[Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples]] and [[Erasmus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This time he progressed with no special delay, finishing the course in three years</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=CRNR503T|name=Cranmer, Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after receiving his [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts]] degree in 1515, he was elected to a [[Fellow]]ship of Jesus College</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ridley|1962|p=16}}; {{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=19–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;Sometime after Cranmer took his MA, he married a woman named Joan</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he was not yet a priest, he was forced to forfeit his fellowship, resulting in the loss of his residence at Jesus College</span>
				<span class='text'> To support himself and his wife, he took a job as a [[Reader (academic rank)|reader]] at [[Buckingham College, Cambridge|Buckingham Hall]] (later reformed as [[Magdalene College, Cambridge|Magdalene College]])</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Joan died during her first childbirth, Jesus College showed its regard for Cranmer by reinstating his fellowship</span>
				<span class='text'>He began studying theology and by 1520 he had been [[holy orders|ordained]], the university already having named him as one of their preachers</span>
				<span class='text'>He received his [[Doctor of Divinity]] degree in 1526</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ridley|1962|pp=16–20}}; {{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=21–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;Not much is known about Cranmer’s thoughts and experiences during his three decades at Cambridge</span>
				<span class='text'>Traditionally, he has been portrayed as a humanist whose enthusiasm for biblical scholarship prepared him for the adoption of [[Lutheran]] ideas, which were spreading during the 1520s</span>
				<span class='text'>However, a study of his [[marginalia]] reveals an early antipathy to [[Martin Luther]] and an admiration for Erasmus</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernard|2005|p=506}}; {{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=23–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Cardinal Wolsey]], the king's [[Lord Chancellor]], selected several Cambridge scholars, including [[Edward Lee, Archbishop of York|Edward Lee]], [[Stephen Gardiner]] and [[Richard Sampson]], to be diplomats throughout Europe, Cranmer was chosen to take a minor role in the English embassy in Spain</span>
				<span class='text'>Two recently discovered letters written by Cranmer describe an early encounter with the king, [[Henry VIII of England]]:  upon Cranmer's return from Spain, in June 1527, the king personally interviewed Cranmer for half an hour</span>
				<span class='text'> Cranmer described the king as &quot;the kindest of princes&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=33–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;==In the service of Henry VIII (1527–1532)==Henry VIII's first marriage had its origins in 1502 when his elder brother, [[Arthur, Prince of Wales|Arthur]], died</span>
				<span class='text'>Their father, [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], then betrothed Arthur's widow, [[Catherine of Aragon]], to the future king</span>
				<span class='text'>The betrothal immediately raised questions related to the biblical prohibition (in Leviticus 18 and 20) against marriage to a brother’s wife</span>
				<span class='text'>The couple married in 1509 and after a series of miscarriages, a daughter, [[Mary I of England|Mary]], was born in 1516</span>
				<span class='text'>By the 1520s, Henry still did not have a son to name as heir and he took this as a sure sign of God’s anger and made overtures to the Vatican about an [[annulment]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|p=42}}</span>
				<span class='text'>According to MacCulloch, he became convinced of this perhaps as much as two years before his passion for Anne Boleyn</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He gave [[Thomas Wolsey|Cardinal Wolsey]] the task of prosecuting his case; Wolsey began by consulting university experts</span>
				<span class='text'>From 1527, in addition to his duties as a Cambridge don, Cranmer assisted with the annulment proceedings</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=41–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Hans Holbein, the Younger, Around 1497-1543 - Portrait of Henry VIII of England - Google Art Project</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|[[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] recognised Cranmer's value in obtaining support for the annulment of his marriage with Catherine of Aragon</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Hans Holbein the Younger]], c</span>
				<span class='text'>1536</span>
				<span class='text'>]In the summer of 1529, Cranmer stayed with relatives in [[Waltham Holy Cross]] to avoid an outbreak of the [[Plague (disease)|plague]] in Cambridge</span>
				<span class='text'>Two of his Cambridge associates, Stephen Gardiner and [[Edward Foxe]], joined him</span>
				<span class='text'>The three discussed the annulment issue and Cranmer suggested putting aside the legal case in Rome in favour of a general canvassing of opinions from university theologians throughout Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>Henry showed much interest in the idea when Gardiner and Foxe presented him this plan</span>
				<span class='text'>It is not known whether the king or his Lord Chancellor, [[Thomas More]], explicitly approved the plan</span>
				<span class='text'>Eventually it was implemented and Cranmer was requested to join the royal team in Rome to gather opinions from the universities</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ridley|1962|pp=25–33}}; {{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=45–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Foxe coordinated the research effort and the team produced the ''[[Collectanea satis copiosa|Collectanea Satis Copiosa]]'' (&quot;The Sufficiently Abundant Collections&quot;) and ''The Determinations'', historical and theological support for the argument that the king exercised supreme jurisdiction within his realm</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=54–59}}</span>
				<span class='text'>The full title is ''The Determinations of the most famous and most excellent Universities of Italy and France, that it is unlawful for a man to marry his brother's wife, that the Pope hath no power to dispense therewith'' and it is likely that Cranmer undertook the translation from Latin to English</span>
				<span class='text'>Comparing the two language versions, MacCulloch notes that the document reveals the first indications of a change away from his humanist Catholicism towards a more radically reformist stance</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Cranmer’s first contact with a Continental reformer was with [[Simon Grynaeus]], a humanist based in [[Basel]], Switzerland and a follower of the Swiss reformers, [[Huldrych Zwingli]] and [[Johannes Oecolampadius]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In the summer of 1531, Grynaeus took an extended visit to England to offer himself as an intermediary between the king and the Continental reformers</span>
				<span class='text'>He struck up a friendship with Cranmer and after his return to Basel, he wrote about Cranmer to the German reformer [[Martin Bucer]] in [[Strasbourg]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Grynaeus' early contacts initiated Cranmer’s eventual relationship with the Strasbourg and Swiss reformers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=60–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;In January 1532, Cranmer was appointed the resident ambassador at the court of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]</span>
				<span class='text'>As the emperor travelled throughout his realm, Cranmer had to follow him to his residence in [[Ratisbon]] (Regensburg)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ridley|1962|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; He passed through the Lutheran city of [[Nuremberg]] and saw for the first time the effects of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]</span>
				<span class='text'>When the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] was moved to Nuremberg in the summer, he met the leading architect of the Nuremberg reforms, [[Andreas Osiander]]</span>
				<span class='text'>They became good friends, and during that July Cranmer took the surprising action of marrying Margarete, the niece of Osiander's wife</span>
				<span class='text'>This was all the more remarkable given that the marriage required him to set aside his priestly vow of celibacy</span>
				<span class='text'>He did not take her as his mistress, as was the prevailing custom with priests for whom celibacy was too rigorous</span>
				<span class='text'>Scholars note that Cranmer had moved, however moderately at this stage, into identifying with certain Lutheran principles</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hall(1)|1993|p=19}}; {{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|p=72}}; {{Harvnb|Ridley|1962|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; This progress in his personal life, however, could not be matched in his political life as he was unable to persuade Charles, Catherine's nephew, to support the annulment of his aunt's marriage</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ridley|1962|pp=39–47}}; {{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=70–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;==Appointed Archbishop of Canterbury (1532–1534)==[[Image:Anne boleyn</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|The family of [[Anne Boleyn]] secured the appointment of Cranmer as Archbishop of Canterbury</span>
				<span class='text'>Later portrait by an unknown artist</span>
				<span class='text'>]While Cranmer was following Charles through Italy, he received a royal letter dated 1 October 1532 informing him that he had been appointed the new [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], following the death of archbishop [[William Warham]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Cranmer was ordered to return to England</span>
				<span class='text'>The appointment had been secured by the family of [[Anne Boleyn]], who was being courted by Henry</span>
				<span class='text'>When Cranmer's promotion became known in London, it caused great surprise as Cranmer had previously held only minor positions in the Church</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ayris(1)|1993|pp=116–117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cranmer left [[Mantua]] on 19 November and arrived in England at the beginning of January</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ridley|1962|pp=49–53}}; {{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=75–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry personally financed the [[papal bulls]] necessary for Cranmer’s promotion to Canterbury</span>
				<span class='text'>The bulls were easily acquired because the [[papal nuncio]] was under orders from Rome to please the English in an effort to prevent a final breach</span>
				<span class='text'>The bulls arrived around 26 March 1533 and Cranmer was consecrated as archbishop on 30 March in [[St Stephen's Chapel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Even while they were waiting for the bulls, Cranmer continued to work on the annulment proceedings, which required greater urgency after Anne announced her pregnancy</span>
				<span class='text'>Henry and Anne were secretly married on 24 or 25 January 1533 in the presence of a handful of witnesses</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=637–638}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cranmer did not learn of the marriage until a fortnight later</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ridley|1962|pp=53–58}}; {{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=83–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;For the next few months, Cranmer and the king worked on establishing legal procedures on how the monarch's marriage would be judged by his most senior clergy</span>
				<span class='text'>Several drafts of the procedures have been preserved in letters written between the two</span>
				<span class='text'>Once the procedures were agreed, Cranmer opened his court on 10 May, inviting Henry and Catherine of Aragon to appear</span>
				<span class='text'>Gardiner represented the king; Catherine did not appear or send a proxy</span>
				<span class='text'>On 23 May Cranmer pronounced the judgement that Henry's marriage with Catherine was against the law of God</span>
				<span class='text'>He even issued a threat of [[excommunication]] if Henry did not stay away from Catherine</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ridley|1962|pp=59–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry was now free to marry and, on 28 May, Cranmer validated Henry and Anne’s marriage</span>
				<span class='text'>On 1 June, Cranmer personally crowned and anointed Anne queen and delivered to her the [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom|sceptre and rod]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=90–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pope [[Clement VII]] was furious at this defiance, but he could not take decisive action as he was pressured by other monarchs to avoid an irreparable breach with England</span>
				<span class='text'>However, on 9 July he provisionally excommunicated Henry and his advisers (which included Cranmer) unless he repudiated Anne by the end of September</span>
				<span class='text'>Henry kept Anne as his wife and, on 7 September, Anne gave birth to [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Cranmer [[Baptism|baptised]] her immediately afterwards and acted as one of her godparents</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=97–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;It is difficult to assess how Cranmer’s theological views had evolved since his Cambridge days</span>
				<span class='text'>There is evidence that he continued to support humanism; he renewed Erasmus' pension that had previously been granted by Archbishop Warham</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dowling|1993|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1533, he was confronted with the difficult task of not only disciplining a reformer, but also seeing him burnt at the stake</span>
				<span class='text'>[[John Frith]] was condemned to death for his views on the [[eucharist]]: he denied the [[real presence]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Cranmer personally tried to persuade him to change his views without success</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ridley|1962|pp=67–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he rejected Frith’s radicalism, by 1534 he clearly signalled that he had broken with Rome and that he had set a new theological course</span>
				<span class='text'>He supported the cause of reform by gradually replacing the old guard in his [[ecclesiastical province]] with men who followed the new thinking such as [[Hugh Latimer]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernard|2005|p=507}}; {{Harvnb|Ridley|1962|pp=87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; He intervened in religious disputes, supporting reformers to the disappointment of religious conservatives who desired to maintain the link with Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=98–102, 109–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;==Under the vicegerency (1535–1538)==&lt;!-- NOTE: Vicegerency and vicegerent are the correct terms in this passage, please do not change them--&gt;[[Image:Cromwell,Thomas(1EEssex)01</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|[[Thomas Cromwell]] was the vicegerent acting as the main agent for the king over spiritual matters</span>
				<span class='text'>Portrait by [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]], 1532–1533</span>
				<span class='text'>]Cranmer was not immediately accepted by the bishops within his province</span>
				<span class='text'>When he attempted a [[canonical visitation]], he had to avoid locations where a resident conservative bishop might make an embarrassing personal challenge to his authority</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1535, Cranmer had difficult encounters with several bishops, [[John Stokesley]], [[John Longland]], and [[Stephen Gardiner]] among others</span>
				<span class='text'>They objected to Cranmer’s power and title and argued that the [[Act of Supremacy]] did not define his role</span>
				<span class='text'>This prompted [[Thomas Cromwell]], the king's chief minister, to activate and to take the office of the [[vicegerent]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=91–92, 133}}&lt;/ref&gt; the deputy supreme head of ecclesiastical affairs</span>
				<span class='text'>He created another set of institutions that gave a clear structure to the royal supremacy</span>
				<span class='text'>Hence, the archbishop was eclipsed by Vicegerent Cromwell in regards to the king's spiritual jurisdiction</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ayris(5)|2000|pp=81–86}}; {{Harvnb|Ayris(1)|1993|pp=125–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence that Cranmer resented his position as junior partner</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ridley|1962|pp=91–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was an exceptional scholar, he lacked the political ability to outface even clerical opponents</span>
				<span class='text'>Those tasks were left to Cromwell</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=127–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;On 29 January 1536, when Anne miscarried a son, the king began to reflect again on the biblical prohibitions that had haunted him during his marriage with Catherine of Aragon</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the miscarriage, the king started to take an interest in [[Jane Seymour]]</span>
				<span class='text'>By 24 April, he had commissioned Cromwell to prepare the case for a divorce</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|p=154}}; {{Harvnb|Schofield|2008|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unaware of these plans, Cranmer had continued to write letters to Cromwell on minor matters up to 22 April</span>
				<span class='text'>Anne was sent to the [[Tower of London]] on 2 May, and Cranmer was urgently summoned by Cromwell</span>
				<span class='text'>On the very next day, Cranmer wrote a letter to the king expressing his doubts about the queen’s guilt, highlighting his own esteem for Anne</span>
				<span class='text'>After it was delivered, however, Cranmer was resigned to the fact that the end of Anne's marriage was inevitable</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ridley|1962|pp=100–104}}; {{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=157–158}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 May, he saw Anne in the Tower and heard her confession and the following day, he pronounced the marriage null and void</span>
				<span class='text'>Two days later, Anne was executed; Cranmer was one of the few who publicly mourned her death</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=149–159}}&lt;/ref&gt;The vicegerency brought the pace of reforms under the control of the king</span>
				<span class='text'>A balance was instituted between the conservatives and the reformers and this was seen in the ''[[Ten Articles]]'', the first attempt at defining the beliefs of the Henrician Church</span>
				<span class='text'>The articles had a two-part structure</span>
				<span class='text'>The first five articles showed the influence of the reformers by recognising only three of the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|former seven]] [[sacraments]]: baptism, eucharist, and [[penance]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The last five articles concerned the roles of [[Religious images|images]], [[Veneration|saints]], [[Ritual|rites]] and ceremonies, and [[purgatory]], and they reflected the views of the traditionalists</span>
				<span class='text'>Two early drafts of the document have been preserved and show different teams of theologians at work</span>
				<span class='text'>The competition between the conservatives and reformers is revealed in rival editorial corrections made by Cranmer and [[Cuthbert Tunstall]], the [[bishop of Durham]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The end product had something that pleased and annoyed both sides of the debate</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=160–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 11 July, Cranmer, Cromwell, and the [[Convocation of the English Clergy|Convocation]], the general assembly of the clergy, had subscribed to the ''Ten Articles''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ridley|1962|pp=113–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;In the autumn of 1536, the north of England was convulsed in a series of uprisings collectively known as the [[Pilgrimage of Grace]], the most serious opposition to Henry’s policies</span>
				<span class='text'>Cromwell and Cranmer were the primary targets of the protesters’ fury</span>

				<span class='text'>The outcome after months of debate was ''[[The Institution of a Christian Man]]'' informally known from the first issue as the Bishops' Book</span>
				<span class='text'>The book was initially proposed in February 1537 in the first vicegerential synod, ordered by Cromwell, for the whole Church</span>
				<span class='text'>Cromwell opened the proceedings, but as the synod progressed, Cranmer and Foxe took on the chairmanship and the co-ordination</span>
				<span class='text'>Foxe did most of the final editing and the book was published in late September</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ridley|1962|pp=118–123}}; {{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=185–196, 205}}&lt;/ref&gt;Even after publication, the book’s status remained vague because the king had not given his full support to it</span>
				<span class='text'>In a draft letter, Henry noted that he had not read the book, but supported its printing</span>
				<span class='text'>His attention was most likely occupied by the pregnancy of Jane Seymour and the birth of the male heir, [[Edward VI of England|Edward]], that Henry had sought for so long</span>
				<span class='text'>Jane died shortly after giving birth and her funeral was held on 12 November</span>
				<span class='text'>That month Henry started to work on the Bishops’ Book; his amendments were sent to Cranmer, Sampson, and others for comment</span>
				<span class='text'>Cranmer's responses to the king were far more confrontational than his colleagues' and he wrote at much greater length</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ridley|1962|pp=123–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; They reveal unambiguous statements supporting reformed theology such as justification by faith or ''[[sola fide]]'' (faith alone) and [[predestination]]</span>
				<span class='text'>However, his words did not convince the king</span>
				<span class='text'>A new statement of faith would be delayed until 1543 with the publication of the King’s Book</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=205–213}}&lt;/ref&gt;In 1538, the king and Cromwell arranged with Lutheran princes to have detailed discussions on forming a political and religious alliance</span>
				<span class='text'>Henry had been seeking a new embassy from the [[Schmalkaldic League]] since summer 1537</span>
				<span class='text'>The Lutherans were delighted by this and they sent a joint delegation from various German cities, including a colleague of Martin Luther, [[Friedrich Myconius]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The delegates arrived in England on 27 May 1538</span>
				<span class='text'>After initial meetings with the king, Cromwell, and Cranmer, discussions on theological differences were transferred to [[Lambeth Palace]] under Cranmer’s chairmanship</span>
				<span class='text'>Progress on an agreement was slow partly due to Cromwell being too busy to help expedite the proceedings and partly due to the negotiating team on the English side, which was evenly balanced between conservatives and reformers</span>
				<span class='text'>The talks dragged on through the summer with the Germans becoming weary despite the Archbishop’s strenuous efforts</span>
				<span class='text'>The negotiations, however, were fatally neutralised by an appointee of the king</span>
				<span class='text'>Cranmer’s colleague, Edward Foxe, who sat on Henry’s [[Privy Council]], had died earlier in the year</span>
				<span class='text'>The king chose as his replacement Cranmer’s conservative rival, Cuthbert Tunstall, who was told to stay near Henry to give advice</span>
				<span class='text'>On 5 August, when the German delegates sent a letter to the king regarding three items that particularly worried them (compulsory clerical celibacy, the withholding of the chalice from the laity, and the maintenance of [[Sine populo|private masses]] for the dead), Tunstall was able to intervene for the king and to influence the decision</span>
				<span class='text'>The result was a thorough dismissal by the king of many of the Germans’ chief concerns</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Cranmer begged the Germans to continue with the negotiations using the argument &quot;to consider the many thousands of souls in England&quot; at stake, they left on 1 October having made no substantial achievements</span>

				<span class='text'>In early 1539, Melanchthon wrote several letters to Henry criticising his views on religion, in particular his support of clerical celibacy</span>
				<span class='text'>By late April another delegation from the Lutheran princes arrived to build on Melanchthon’s exhortations</span>
				<span class='text'>Cromwell wrote a letter to the king in support of the new Lutheran mission</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the king had begun to change his stance and concentrated on wooing conservative opinion in England rather than reaching out to the Lutherans</span>
				<span class='text'>On 28 April 1539, Parliament met for the first time in three years</span>
				<span class='text'>Cranmer was present, but Cromwell was unable to attend due to ill health</span>
				<span class='text'>On 5 May the [[House of Lords]] created a committee with the customary religious balance between conservatives and reformers to examine and determine doctrine</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the committee was given little time to do the detailed work needed for a thorough revision</span>
				<span class='text'>On 16 May, the [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]] noted that the committee had not agreed on anything, and proposed that the Lords examine six doctrinal questions—which eventually formed the basis of the ''[[Six Articles]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>They affirmed the conservative interpretation of doctrines such as the real presence, clerical celibacy, and the necessity of auricular confession, the private confession of sins to a priest</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ridley|1962|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Act of the Six Articles neared passage in Parliament, Cranmer moved his wife and children out of England to safety</span>
				<span class='text'>Up until this time, the family was kept quietly hidden, most likely in [[Ford Palace]] in [[Kent]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Act passed Parliament at the end of June and it forced Latimer and [[Nicholas Shaxton]] to resign their dioceses given their outspoken opposition to the measure</span>

				<span class='text'>Engraving by [[Albrecht Dürer]], 1526]]The setback for the reformers was short-lived</span>
				<span class='text'>By September, Henry was displeased with the results of the Act and its promulgators; the ever-loyal Cranmer and Cromwell were back in favour</span>
				<span class='text'>The king asked his archbishop to write a new preface for the [[Great Bible]], an English translation of the Bible that was first published in April 1539 under the direction of Cromwell</span>
				<span class='text'>The preface was in the form of a sermon addressed to readers</span>
				<span class='text'>As for Cromwell, he was delighted that his plan of a royal marriage between Henry and [[Anne of Cleves]], the sister of a German prince was accepted by the king</span>
				<span class='text'>In Cromwell's view, the marriage could potentially bring back contacts with the Schmalkaldic League</span>
				<span class='text'>Henry was dismayed with Anne when they first met on 1 January 1540 but married her reluctantly on 6 January in a ceremony officiated by Cranmer</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the marriage ended in disaster as Henry decided shortly thereafter that he would request a royal divorce</span>
				<span class='text'>This resulted in Henry being placed in an embarrassing position and Cromwell suffered the consequences</span>
				<span class='text'>His old enemies, including the Duke of Norfolk, took advantage of the weakened Cromwell and he was arrested on 10 June</span>
				<span class='text'>He immediately lost the support of all his friends, including Cranmer</span>
				<span class='text'>However, as Cranmer had done for Anne Boleyn, he wrote a letter to the king defending the past work of Cromwell</span>
				<span class='text'>Henry's marriage to Anne of Cleves was quickly annulled on 9 July by the vice-gerential synod, now led by Cranmer and Gardiner</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ridley|1962|pp=195–206}}; {{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=238, 256–274}}&lt;/ref&gt;Following the annulment, Cromwell was executed on 28 July</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Howell|1816|pp=433–440}}</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Howell, several charges were brought against him but the chief one was heresy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Cranmer now found himself in a politically prominent position, with no one else to shoulder the burden</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|p=275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the rest of Henry’s reign, he clung to Henry’s authority</span>
				<span class='text'>The king had total trust in him and in return, Cranmer could not conceal anything from the king</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of June 1541, Henry with his new wife, [[Catherine Howard]], left for his first visit to the north of England</span>
				<span class='text'>Cranmer was left in London as a member of a council taking care of matters for the king in his absence</span>
				<span class='text'>His colleagues were Lord Chancellor [[Thomas Audley, 1st Baron Audley of Walden|Thomas Audley]] and [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Edward Seymour]], Earl of Hertford</span>
				<span class='text'>This was Cranmer's first major piece of responsibility outside the Church</span>
				<span class='text'>In October, while the king and queen were away, a reformer named [[John Lascelles]] revealed to Cranmer that Catherine engaged in extramarital affairs</span>
				<span class='text'>Cranmer gave the information to Audley and Seymour and they decided to wait until Henry’s return</span>
				<span class='text'>Afraid of angering the king, Audley and Seymour suggested that Cranmer inform Henry</span>
				<span class='text'>Cranmer slipped a message to Henry during mass on [[All Saints Day]]</span>
				<span class='text'>An investigation revealed the truth of the marital indiscretions and Catherine was executed in February 1542</span>

				<span class='text'>They prepared articles to present to the Council, but at the last moment, additional denunciations were added by Stephen Gardiner’s nephew, [[Germain Gardiner]]</span>
				<span class='text'>These new articles attacked Cranmer and listed his misdeeds back to 1541</span>
				<span class='text'>This document and the actions that followed were the basis of the so-called [[Prebendaries' Plot]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The articles were delivered to the Council in London and were probably read on 22 April 1543</span>
				<span class='text'>The king most likely saw the articles against Cranmer that night</span>
				<span class='text'>The archbishop, however, appeared unaware that an attack on his person was made</span>
				<span class='text'>His commissioners in Lambeth dealt specifically with Turner’s case where he was acquitted, much to the fury of the conservatives</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=297–308}}&lt;/ref&gt;While the plot against Cranmer was proceeding, the reformers were being attacked on other fronts</span>
				<span class='text'>On 20 April, the Convocation reconvened to consider the revision of the Bishops’ Book</span>
				<span class='text'>Cranmer presided over the sub-committees, but the conservatives were able to overturn many reforming ideas, including justification by faith</span>
				<span class='text'>On 5 May, the new revision called ''[[A Necessary Doctrine and Erudition for any Christian Man]]'' or the King’s Book was released</span>
				<span class='text'>Doctrinally, it was far more conservative than the Bishops’ Book</span>
				<span class='text'>On 10 May, the reformers received another blow</span>
				<span class='text'>Parliament passed the Act for the Advancement of True Religion, which abolished &quot;erroneous books&quot; and restricted the reading of the Bible in English to those of noble status</span>
				<span class='text'>From May to August, reformers were examined, forced to recant, or imprisoned</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=308–311}}&lt;/ref&gt;For five months, Henry took no action on the accusations against his archbishop</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|p=316}}</span>
				<span class='text'>It is not known why Henry took so long to react to the charges against Cranmer</span>
				<span class='text'>MacCulloch notes that it was Henry's nature to brood over the evidence against his archbishop</span>
				<span class='text'>He also speculates that Cranmer's support of the King's Book made Henry reflect about whether the charges were serious</span>
				<span class='text'>Another possibility is that in playing the situation out, Henry could observe the behaviour of the leading politicians until he was ready to intervene</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The conspiracy was finally revealed to Cranmer by the king himself</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Cranmer’s secretary, [[Ralph Morice]], sometime in September 1543 the king showed Cranmer a paper summarising the accusations against him</span>
				<span class='text'>An investigation was to be mounted and Cranmer was appointed chief investigator</span>
				<span class='text'>Surprise raids were carried out, evidence gathered, and ringleaders identified</span>
				<span class='text'>Typically, Cranmer put the clergymen involved in the conspiracy through immediate humiliation, but he eventually forgave them and continued to use their services</span>
				<span class='text'>To show his trust in Cranmer, Henry gave Cranmer his personal ring</span>
				<span class='text'>When the Privy Council arrested Cranmer at the end of November, the nobles were stymied by the symbol of the king’s trust in him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ridley|1962|pp=235–238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cranmer’s victory ended with two second-rank leaders imprisoned and Germain Gardiner executed</span>

				<span class='text'>]With the atmosphere in Cranmer’s favour, he pursued quiet efforts to reform the Church, particularly the liturgy</span>
				<span class='text'>On 27 May 1544 the first officially authorised vernacular service was published, the processional service of intercession known as the [[Exhortation and Litany (1544)|Exhortation and Litany]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It survives today with minor modifications in the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The traditional [[litany]] uses [[invocation]]s to saints, but Cranmer thoroughly reformed this aspect by providing no opportunity in the text for such [[veneration]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Additional reformers were elected to the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] and new legislation was introduced to curb the effects of the Act of the Six Articles and the Act for the Advancement of True Religion</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=327–329, 347}}&lt;/ref&gt;In 1546, the conservatives in a coalition including Gardiner, the Duke of Norfolk, the Lord Chancellor [[Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton|Wriothesley]], and the bishop of London, [[Edmund Bonner]], made one last attempt to challenge the reformers</span>
				<span class='text'>Several reformers with links to Cranmer were targeted</span>
				<span class='text'>Some such as Lascelles were burnt at the stake</span>
				<span class='text'>However, powerful reform-minded nobles Edward Seymour and [[John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland|John Dudley]] returned to England during the summer from overseas and they were able to turn the tide against the conservatives</span>
				<span class='text'>Two incidents in autumn tipped the balance</span>
				<span class='text'>Gardiner was disgraced before the king when he refused to agree to exchange episcopal estates and the son of the Duke of Norfolk was charged with treason and executed</span>
				<span class='text'>There is no evidence that Cranmer played any part in these political games and there were no further plots as the king's health ebbed in his final months</span>
				<span class='text'>Cranmer performed his final duties for the king on 28 January 1547 when he gave a reformed statement of faith while gripping Henry’s hand instead of giving him his [[last rites]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Cranmer mourned Henry’s death and it was later said that he demonstrated his grief by growing a beard</span>
				<span class='text'>The beard was also a sign of his break with the past</span>
				<span class='text'>Continental reformers grew beards to mark their rejection of the old Church and this significance of clerical beards was well-understood in England</span>
				<span class='text'>On 31 January, he was among the executors of the king’s final will that nominated [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Edward Seymour]] as [[Lord Protector]] and welcomed the boy king, Edward VI</span>

				<span class='text'>]Under the regency of Seymour, the reformers were now part of the establishment</span>
				<span class='text'>A royal visitation of the provinces took place in August 1547 and each parish that was visited was instructed to obtain a copy of the ''[[The Books of Homilies|Homilies]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>This book consisted of twelve homilies of which four were written by Cranmer</span>
				<span class='text'>His reassertion of the doctrine of justification by faith elicited a strong reaction from Gardiner</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bagchi|Steinmetz|2004|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the &quot;Homily of Good Works annexed to Faith&quot;, Cranmer attacked [[Christian monasticism|monasticism]] and the importance of various personal actions involved in liturgical recitations and ceremonies</span>
				<span class='text'>Hence, he narrowed the range of good works that would be considered necessary and reinforced the primacy of faith</span>

				<span class='text'>Cranmer had been in contact with Martin Bucer since the time when initial contacts were made with the Schmalkaldic League</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Cranmer and Bucer's relationship became ever closer due to Charles V’s victory over the League at [[Battle of Mühlberg|Mühlberg]], which left England as the sole major nation that gave sanctuary to persecuted reformers</span>
				<span class='text'>Cranmer wrote a letter to Bucer (now lost) with questions on eucharistic theology</span>
				<span class='text'>In Bucer's reply dated 28 November 1547, he denied the real presence and condemned [[transubstantiation]] and the [[adoration]] of the elements</span>
				<span class='text'>The letter was delivered to Cranmer by two Italian reformed theologians, [[Pietro Martire Vermigli|Peter Martyr]] and [[Bernardino Ochino]] who were invited to take refuge in England</span>
				<span class='text'>Martyr also brought with him an epistle written allegedly by [[John Chrysostom]] (now regarded as a forgery), ''Ad Caesarium Monachum'', which appeared to provide [[patristic]] support against the real presence</span>

				<span class='text'>]The first result of co-operation and consultation between Cranmer and Bucer was the Ordinal, the liturgy for the ordination of priests</span>
				<span class='text'>This was missing in the first Prayer Book and was not published until 1550</span>
				<span class='text'>Cranmer adopted Bucer’s draft and created three services for commissioning a deacon, a priest, and a bishop</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ayris(3)|2005|pp=97–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Cranmer produced the ''[[Defence of the True and Catholic Doctrine of the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ]]'', a semi-official explanation of the eucharistic theology within the Prayer Book</span>
				<span class='text'>It was the first full-length book to bear Cranmer’s name on the title-page</span>
				<span class='text'>The preface summarises his quarrel with Rome in a well-known passage where he compared &quot;beads, pardons, pilgrimages, and such other like popery&quot; with weeds, but the roots of the weeds were transubstantiation, the real presence, and the sacrificial nature of the mass</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ridley|1962|pp=322–323}}; {{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=460–469}}&lt;/ref&gt;Although Bucer assisted in the development of the English Reformation, he was still quite concerned about the speed of its progress</span>
				<span class='text'>Both Bucer and Fagius had noticed that the 1549 Prayer Book was not a remarkable step forward, although Cranmer assured Bucer that it was only a first step and that its initial form was only temporary</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=410–411}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the winter 1550, Bucer was becoming disillusioned</span>
				<span class='text'>Cranmer, however, made sure that he did not feel alienated and kept in close touch with him</span>
				<span class='text'>This attention paid off during the [[vestments controversy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This incident was initiated by [[John Hooper (bishop)|John Hooper]], a follower of [[Heinrich Bullinger]] who had recently returned from [[Zürich]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Hooper was unhappy with Cranmer’s Prayer Book and Ordinal and he particularly objected to the use of ceremonies and vestments</span>
				<span class='text'>When the Privy Council selected him to be the [[Bishop of Gloucester]] on 15 May 1550, he laid down conditions that he would not wear the required vestments</span>
				<span class='text'>He found an ally among the Continental reformers in Jan Łaski who had become a leader of the [[Dutch Church, Austin Friars|Stranger church]] in London, a designated place of worship for Continental Protestant refugees</span>
				<span class='text'>His church’s forms and practices had taken reforms much further than Cranmer would have liked</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Bucer and Peter Martyr, while they sympathised with Hooper’s position, supported Cranmer's arguments of timing and authority</span>
				<span class='text'>Cranmer and Ridley stood their ground</span>
				<span class='text'>This led to Hooper’s imprisonment and he eventually gave in</span>
				<span class='text'>He was consecrated on 8 March 1551 according to the Ordinal and he preached before the king in his episcopal garments</span>
				<span class='text'>Cranmer’s vision of reform through careful steps under the authority of the government was maintained</span>

				<span class='text'>In December he was put on trial and although acquitted of treason, he was judged guilty of [[felony]] and put to death on 22 January 1552</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Loades|2004|pp=109–111}}</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Loades, a felony, a lesser crime than treason in English law, included gathering men unlawfully and plotting the death of a councillor</span>
				<span class='text'>Seymour admitted to these actions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This was the beginning of the breach between Cranmer and Dudley</span>
				<span class='text'>It was aggravated during the year by the gradual appropriation of ecclesiastical property by the regency</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;MacCulloch520&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|p=520}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even throughout this political turmoil, Cranmer worked simultaneously on three major projects in his reform programme: the revision of [[canon law]], the revision of the Prayer Book, and the formation of a statement of doctrine</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=493–500}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:Pietro Vermigli by Hans Asper</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|[[Pietro Martire Vermigli]] or Peter Martyr greatly assisted Cranmer in the [[English Reformation]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Portrait by [[Hans Asper]], 1560</span>
				<span class='text'>]The original Roman canon law that defined governance within the Church clearly needed revision following Henry's break with Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>Several revision attempts were made throughout Henry's reign, but these initial projects were shelved as the speed of reform outpaced the time required to work on a revision</span>
				<span class='text'>As the reformation stabilised, Cranmer formed a committee in December 1551 to restart the work</span>
				<span class='text'>He recruited Peter Martyr to the committee and he also asked Łaski and Hooper to participate, demonstrating his usual ability to forgive past actions</span>
				<span class='text'>Cranmer and Martyr realised that a successful enactment of a reformed ecclesiastical law-code in England would have international significance</span>
				<span class='text'>Cranmer planned to draw together all the reformed churches of Europe under England’s leadership to counter the [[Council of Trent]], the Roman Catholic Church's response to the [[Protestant Reformation]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In March 1552, Cranmer invited the foremost Continental reformers, Bullinger, [[John Calvin]], and Melanchthon to come to England and to participate in an ecumenical council</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=501–502}}&lt;/ref&gt; The response was disappointing: Melanchthon did not respond, Bullinger stated that neither of them could leave Germany as it was riven by war between the Emperor and the Lutheran princes, and while Calvin showed some enthusiasm, he said he was unable to come</span>
				<span class='text'>Cranmer acknowledged Calvin and replied stating, &quot;Meanwhile we will reform the English Church to the utmost of our ability and give our labour that both its doctrines and laws will be improved after the model of holy scripture</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MacCulloch520&quot;/&gt; One partial manuscript of the project survived that was annotated with corrections and comments by Cranmer and Martyr</span>
				<span class='text'>When the final version was presented to Parliament, the breach between Cranmer and Dudley was complete and the regent effectively killed the canon law bill in the House of Lords</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ayris(2)|1993|pp=318–321}}; {{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=500–502, 518–520, 533}}&lt;/ref&gt;As in the first Prayer Book, the origins and participants in the work of its revision are obscure, but it was clear that Cranmer led the project and steered its development</span>
				<span class='text'>It had begun as early as the end of 1549 when the Convocation of Canterbury met to discuss the matter</span>
				<span class='text'>Late in 1550, the opinions of Martyr and Bucer were sought on how the liturgy might be improved and they significantly influenced the revision</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bagchi|Steinmetz|2004|pp=158–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spiritual presence view was clarified by the use of entirely different words when the communicants are offered the bread and the wine</span>
				<span class='text'>New [[rubrics]] noted that any kind of bread could be used and any bread or wine that remained could be used by the [[curate]], thus disassociating the elements from any physical presence</span>
				<span class='text'>The new book removed any possibility of prayers for the dead, as such prayers implied support for the doctrine of purgatory</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ridley|1962|pp=322–327}}; {{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=504–513}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Act of Uniformity 1552]], which authorised the book's use, specified that it be exclusively used from 1 November</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the final version was not officially published until nearly the last minute, due to Dudley's intervention</span>
				<span class='text'>While travelling in the north of the country, he met the Scots reformer, [[John Knox]], then based in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Impressed by his preaching, Dudley selected him to be a royal chaplain and brought him south to participate in the reform projects</span>
				<span class='text'>In a sermon before the king, Knox attacked the practice of kneeling during communion</span>
				<span class='text'>On 27 September 1552, the Privy Council stopped the printing of the new Prayer Book and told Cranmer to revise it</span>
				<span class='text'>He responded with a long letter using the argument that it was for Parliament with the royal assent to decide any changes in the liturgy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ayris(4)|2000|pp=15–17, 29–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 October, the council decided to keep the liturgy as it is and add the so-called ''[[Black Rubric]]'', which explained that no adoration was intended when kneeling at communion</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ridley|1962|pp=336–337}}; {{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=512, 525–530}}&lt;/ref&gt;The origins of the Statement that eventually became the ''[[Forty-Two Articles]]'' are equally obscure</span>
				<span class='text'>As early as December 1549, the archbishop was demanding from his bishops subscription to certain doctrinal articles</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1551 Cranmer presented a version of a statement to the bishops, but its status remained ambiguous</span>
				<span class='text'>Cranmer did not devote much effort into developing the articles, most likely due to work on the canon law revision</span>
				<span class='text'>He became more interested once the hope for an ecumenical council began to fade</span>
				<span class='text'>By September 1552, draft versions of the articles were being worked on by Cranmer and [[John Cheke]], his scholarly friend who was commissioned to translate them into Latin</span>
				<span class='text'>When the ''Forty-Two Articles'' were finally published in May 1553, the title-page declared that the articles were agreed upon by the Convocation and were published by the authority of the king</span>
				<span class='text'>This was not in fact the case and the mistake was likely caused by miscommunications between the archbishop and the Privy Council</span>
				<span class='text'>Cranmer complained about this to the council, but the authorities responded by noting that the articles were developed during the time of the Convocation—hence evading a direct answer</span>
				<span class='text'>The council gave Cranmer the unfortunate task of requiring subscription to the articles from the bishops, many of whom opposed them and pointed out the anomaly of the title-page</span>
				<span class='text'>It was while Cranmer was carrying out this duty that events unfolded that would render the subscriptions futile</span>

				<span class='text'>In May 1553, the council sent several letters to Continental reformers assuring them that Edward's health was improving</span>
				<span class='text'>Among the letters was one addressed to Melanchthon inviting him to come to England to take up the [[Regius Professor of Divinity|Regius Chair]] in Cambridge which was vacant since the death of Martin Bucer in February 1551</span>
				<span class='text'>Both Henry VIII and Cranmer had previously failed to convince Melanchthon to come; this time the council made a serious effort by sending him an advance to cover his travel expenses</span>
				<span class='text'>Cranmer sent a personal letter urging him to take the offer</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite his plea, Melanchthon never made the voyage to England</span>
				<span class='text'>While this effort to shore up the reformation was taking place, the council was working to convince several judges to put on the throne [[Lady Jane Grey]], Edward's cousin and a Protestant, instead of Mary, Henry and Catherine of Aragon's daughter and a Catholic</span>
				<span class='text'>On 17 June 1553 the king made his will noting Jane would succeed him, contravening the [[Third Succession Act]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Cranmer tried to speak to Edward alone, but he was refused and his audience with Edward occurred in the presence of the councillors</span>
				<span class='text'>Edward told him that he supported what he wrote in his will</span>
				<span class='text'>Cranmer’s decision to support Jane must have occurred before 19 June when royal orders were sent to convene the Convocation for the recognition of the new succession</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=538–541}}&lt;/ref&gt;By mid-July, there were serious provincial revolts in Mary’s favour and support for Jane in the council fell</span>
				<span class='text'>As Mary was proclaimed queen, Dudley, Ridley, Cheke, and Jane’s father, the [[Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk|Duke of Suffolk]] were imprisoned</span>
				<span class='text'>However, no action was taken against the archbishop</span>
				<span class='text'>On 8 August he led Edward’s funeral according to the rites of the Prayer Book</span>
				<span class='text'>During these months, he advised others, including Peter Martyr, to flee England, but he himself chose to stay</span>
				<span class='text'>Reformed bishops were removed from office and conservative clergy, such as Edmund Bonner, had their old positions restored</span>
				<span class='text'>Cranmer did not go down without a fight</span>
				<span class='text'>When rumours spread that he authorised the use of the mass in Canterbury Cathedral, he declared them to be false and said, &quot;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;all the doctrine and religion, by our said sovereign lord king Edward VI is more pure and according to God's word, than any that hath been used in England these thousand years</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Heinze|1993|pp=263–264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not surprisingly, the government regarded Cranmer's declaration as tantamount to sedition</span>
				<span class='text'>He was ordered to stand before the council in the [[Star Chamber]] on 14 September and on that day he said his final goodbye to Martyr</span>
				<span class='text'>Cranmer was sent straight to the Tower to join Hugh Latimer and Nicholas Ridley</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=547–553}}&lt;/ref&gt;On 13 November 1553 Cranmer and four others were brought to trial for treason, found guilty, and condemned to death</span>
				<span class='text'>Throughout February 1554 Jane Grey and other rebels were executed</span>
				<span class='text'>It was now time to deal with the religious leaders of the reformation and so on 8 March 1554 the Privy Council ordered Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer to be transferred to [[Bocardo Prison|Bocardo prison]] in Oxford to await a second trial for heresy</span>
				<span class='text'>During this time Cranmer was able to smuggle out a letter to Martyr who had fled to Strasbourg, the last surviving document written in his own hand</span>
				<span class='text'>He stated that the desperate situation of the church was proof that it will eventually be delivered and wrote, &quot;I pray that God may grant that we may endure to the end!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=554–555, 561–562, 572–573}} ''Cf''</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;he that endureth to the end shall be saved&quot; (Matthew 10:22)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Cranmer remained isolated in Bocardo prison for seventeen months before the trial started on 12 September 1555</span>
				<span class='text'>Although it took place in England, the trial was under papal jurisdiction and the final verdict would come from Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>Under interrogation, Cranmer admitted to every fact that was placed before him, but he denied any treachery, disobedience, or heresy</span>
				<span class='text'>The trial of Latimer and Ridley started shortly after Cranmer's but their verdicts came almost immediately and they were burnt at the stake on 16 October</span>
				<span class='text'>Cranmer was taken to a tower to watch the proceedings</span>
				<span class='text'>On 4 December, Rome decided Cranmer's fate by [[Benefit of clergy|depriving him of the archbishopric]] and giving permission to the secular authorities to carry out their sentence</span>

				<span class='text'>On 11 December, Cranmer was taken out of Bocardo and placed in the house of the Dean of [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This new environment was very different from that of his two years in prison</span>
				<span class='text'>He was in an academic community and treated as a guest</span>
				<span class='text'>Approached by a Dominican friar, [[Juan de Villagarcia]], he debated the issues of papal supremacy and purgatory</span>
				<span class='text'>In his first four recantations, produced between the end of January and mid-February, Cranmer submitted himself to the authority of the king and queen and recognised the pope as head of the church</span>
				<span class='text'>On 14 February 1556, he was degraded from holy orders and returned to Bocardo</span>
				<span class='text'>He had conceded very little and Edmund Bonner was not satisfied with these admissions</span>
				<span class='text'>On 24 February a writ was issued to the mayor of Oxford and the date of Cranmer's execution was set for 7 March</span>
				<span class='text'>Two days after the writ was issued, a fifth statement, the first which could be called a true recantation was issued</span>
				<span class='text'>Cranmer repudiated all [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] and [[Reformation in Switzerland|Zwinglian theology]], fully accepted Catholic theology including papal supremacy and transubstantiation, and stated that there was no salvation outside the Catholic Church</span>
				<span class='text'>He announced his joy of returning to the Catholic faith, asked for and received sacramental [[absolution]], and participated in the mass</span>
				<span class='text'>Cranmer's burning was postponed and under normal practice of canon law, he should have been absolved</span>
				<span class='text'>Mary, however, decided that no further postponement was possible</span>
				<span class='text'>His last recantation was issued on 18 March</span>
				<span class='text'>It was a sign of a broken man, a sweeping confession of sin</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Heinze|1993|pp=273–276}}; {{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=584–599}}</span>
				<span class='text'>Heinze and MacCulloch note that Cranmer's recantations can be deduced from two primary sources that had opposite polemical aims, ''Bishop Cranmer's Recantacyons'' by an unknown author and ''Acts and Monuments'' by [[John Foxe]] also known as [[Foxe's Book of Martyrs]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Despite the stipulation in Canon Law that recanting heretics be reprieved, Mary was determined to make an example of Cranmer, arguing that &quot;his iniquity and obstinacy was so great against God and your Grace that your clemency and mercy could have no place with him&quot;, and pressed ahead with his execution</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|p=597}}&lt;/ref&gt;Cranmer was told that he would be able to make a final recantation but this time in public during a service at the [[University Church of St Mary the Virgin|University Church]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote and submitted the speech in advance and it was published after his death</span>
				<span class='text'>At the pulpit on the day of his execution, he opened with a prayer and an exhortation to obey the king and queen, but he ended his sermon totally unexpectedly, deviating from the prepared script</span>
				<span class='text'>He renounced the recantations that he had written or signed with his own hand since his degradation and as such he stated his hand would be punished by being burnt first</span>
				<span class='text'>He then said, &quot;And as for the pope, I refuse him, as Christ's enemy, and [[Antichrist]] with all his false doctrine</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Heinze|1993|p=279}}; {{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|p=603}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was pulled from the pulpit and taken to where [[Hugh Latimer|Latimer]] and [[Nicholas Ridley (martyr)|Ridley]] had been burnt six months before</span>
				<span class='text'>As the flames drew around him, he fulfilled his promise by placing his right hand into the heart of the fire while saying &quot;that unworthy hand&quot; and his dying words were, &quot;Lord Jesus, receive my spirit</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;I see the heavens open and Jesus standing at the right hand of God</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Aftermath and legacy==The Marian government produced a pamphlet with all six recantations plus the text of the speech Cranmer was to have made in the University Church</span>
				<span class='text'>His subsequent withdrawal of his recantations was not mentioned, though what actually happened soon became common knowledge, undermining the effectiveness of Marian propaganda</span>
				<span class='text'>Similarly, the Protestant party had difficulty in making use of the event, given Cranmer's recantations</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Marian exiles|exiles]]' propaganda concentrated on publishing various specimens of his writings</span>
				<span class='text'>Eventually [[John Foxe]] put Cranmer's story to effective use in 1559, and it features prominently in his ''[[Acts and Monuments]]'' when it was first printed in 1563</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=606–608}}&lt;/ref&gt;Cranmer's family had been exiled to the Continent in 1539</span>
				<span class='text'>It is not known exactly when they returned to England, but it was soon after the accession of Edward VI in 1547 that Cranmer publicly acknowledged their existence</span>
				<span class='text'>Not much is known about the early years of the children</span>
				<span class='text'>His daughter, Margaret, was likely born in the 1530s and his son, Thomas, came later, probably during the reign of Edward</span>
				<span class='text'>Sometime around Mary's accession, Cranmer's wife, Margarete, escaped to Germany, while his son was entrusted to his brother, Edmund Cranmer, who took him too to the Continent</span>
				<span class='text'>Margarete Cranmer eventually married Cranmer's favourite publisher, [[Edward Whitchurch]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The couple returned to England after Mary's reign and settled in [[Surrey]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Whitchurch also negotiated for the marriage of Margaret to [[Thomas Norton]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Whitchurch died in 1562 and Margarete married for the third time to Bartholomew Scott</span>
				<span class='text'>She died in the 1570s</span>
				<span class='text'>Both of Cranmer's children died without issue and his line became extinct</span>

				<span class='text'>The church that she re-established represented, in effect, a snapshot of the Edwardian Church from September 1552</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus the Elizabethan Prayer Book was basically Cranmer's 1552 edition but without the &quot;Black Rubric&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>In the Convocation of 1563 the ''Forty-Two Articles'' which were never adopted by the Church were altered in the area of eucharistic doctrine to form the ''[[Thirty-Nine Articles]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Most of the exiles returned to England and resumed their careers in the Church</span>
				<span class='text'>To some like [[Edmund Grindal]], an Archbishop of Canterbury during Elizabeth's reign, Cranmer provided a shining example whose work should be upheld and extended</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=620–621}}&lt;/ref&gt;Cranmer's greatest concerns were the maintenance of the royal supremacy and the diffusion of reformed theology and practice</span>
