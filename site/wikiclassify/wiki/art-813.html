				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; At [[Turin]], he read literature and took a keen interest in [[linguistics]], which he studied under [[Matteo Bartoli]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Gramsci was in Turin as it was going through industrialization, with the [[Fiat]] and [[Lancia]] factories recruiting workers from poorer regions</span>
				<span class='text'>Trade unions became established, and the first industrial social conflicts started to emerge</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Gramsci frequented socialist circles as well as associating with Sardinian emigrants</span>
				<span class='text'>His worldview was shaped by both his earlier experiences in Sardinia and his environment on the mainland</span>
				<span class='text'>Gramsci joined the [[Italian Socialist Party]] in late 1913</span>
				<span class='text'>espite showing talent for his studies, Gramsci had financial problems and poor health</span>
				<span class='text'>Together with his growing political commitment, these led to his abandoning his education in early 1915</span>
				<span class='text'>By this time, he had acquired an extensive knowledge of history and philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>At university, he had come into contact with the thought of [[Antonio Labriola]], [[Rodolfo Mondolfo]], [[Giovanni Gentile]], and most importantly, [[Benedetto Croce]], possibly the most widely respected Italian intellectual of his day</span>
				<span class='text'>Such thinkers espoused a brand of [[Hegelian]] Marxism which Labriola had called &quot;philosophy of [[praxis (process)|praxis]]&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Although Gramsci later used this phrase to escape the prison censors, his relationship with this current of thought was ambiguous throughout his life</span>
				<span class='text'>rom 1914 onward, Gramsci's writings for socialist newspapers such as ''[[Il Grido del Popolo]]'' earned him a reputation as a notable journalist</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1916, he became co-editor of the [[Piedmont]] edition of ''[[Avanti! (Italian newspaper)|Avanti!]]'', the Socialist Party official organ</span>
				<span class='text'>An articulate and prolific writer of political theory, Gramsci proved a formidable commentator, writing on all aspects of Turin's social and political life</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Gramsci was, at this time, also involved in the education and organisation of Turin workers; he spoke in public for the first time in 1916 and gave talks on topics such as [[Romain Rolland]], the [[French Revolution]], the [[Paris Commune]], and [[Feminism|the emancipation of women]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In the wake of the arrest of Socialist Party leaders that followed the revolutionary riots of August 1917, Gramsci became one of Turin's leading socialists when he was both elected to the party's Provisional Committee and made editor of ''Il Grido del Popolo''</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|200px|right|''[[L'Ordine Nuovo]]'' (1920)]]In April 1919, with Togliatti, [[Angelo Tasca]] and [[Umberto Terracini]], Gramsci set up the weekly newspaper ''[[L'Ordine Nuovo]]'' (The New Order)</span>
				<span class='text'>In October the same year, despite being divided into various hostile factions, the Socialist Party moved by a large majority to join the [[Third International]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''L'Ordine Nuovo'' group was seen by [[Vladimir Lenin]] as closest in orientation to the [[Bolsheviks]], and it received his backing against the anti-parliamentary programme of the [[left communist]] [[Amadeo Bordiga]]</span>
				<span class='text'>mong tactical debates within the party, Gramsci's group was mainly distinguished by its advocacy of [[workers' councils]], which had come into existence in Turin spontaneously during the large strikes of 1919 and 1920</span>
				<span class='text'>For Gramsci, these councils were the proper means of enabling workers to take control of the task of organising production</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he believed his position at this time to be in keeping with Lenin's policy of &quot;All power to the Soviets&quot;, his stance was attacked by Bordiga for betraying a [[syndicalist]] tendency influenced by the thought of [[Georges Sorel]] and [[Daniel DeLeon]]</span>
				<span class='text'>By the time of the defeat of the Turin workers in spring 1920, Gramsci was almost alone in his defence of the councils</span>
				<span class='text'>==In the Communist Party of Italy===[[File:Gramsci 1922</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|200px|Antonio Gramsci (1922)]]The failure of the workers' councils to develop into a national movement convinced Gramsci that a Communist Party in the [[Leninist]] sense was needed</span>
				<span class='text'>The group around ''L'Ordine Nuovo'' declaimed incessantly against the Italian Socialist Party's centrist leadership and ultimately allied with Bordiga's far larger &quot;abstentionist&quot; faction</span>
				<span class='text'>On 21 January 1921, in the town of [[Livorno|Livorno (Leghorn)]], the [[Communist Party of Italy]] (''Partito Comunista d'Italia – PCI'') was founded</span>
				<span class='text'>Gramsci supported against Bordiga the ''[[Arditi del Popolo]]'', a militant anti-fascist group which struggled against the [[Blackshirts]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ramsci would be a leader of the party from its inception but was subordinate to Bordiga, whose emphasis on discipline, centralism and purity of principles dominated the party's programme until he lost the leadership in 1924</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1922, Gramsci travelled to Russia as a representative of the new party</span>
				<span class='text'>Here, he met Julia Schucht, a young violinist whom Gramsci married in 1923 and by whom he had two sons, Delio (born 1924) and Giuliano (born 1926)</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;|left]]The Russian mission coincided with the advent of fascism in Italy, and Gramsci returned with instructions to foster, against the wishes of the PCI leadership, a united front of leftist parties against fascism</span>
				<span class='text'>Such a front would ideally have had the PCI at its centre, through which Moscow would have controlled all the leftist forces, but others disputed this potential supremacy: socialists did have a certain tradition in Italy, too, while the Communist Party seemed relatively young and too radical</span>
				<span class='text'>Many believed that an eventual coalition led by communists would have functioned too remotely from political debate, and thus would have run the risk of isolation</span>
				<span class='text'>n late 1922 and early 1923, Benito Mussolini's government embarked on a campaign of repression against the opposition parties, arresting most of the PCI leadership, including Bordiga</span>
				<span class='text'>At the end of 1923, Gramsci travelled from Moscow to [[Vienna]], where he tried to revive a party torn by factional strife</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1924 Gramsci, now recognised as head of the PCI, gained election as a deputy for the [[Veneto]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He started organizing the launch of the official newspaper of the party, called ''[[L'Unità]]'' (Unity), living in Rome while his family stayed in Moscow</span>
				<span class='text'>At its Lyon Congress in January 1926, Gramsci's theses calling for a united front to restore democracy to Italy were adopted by the party</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1926, [[Joseph Stalin]]'s manoeuvres inside the Bolshevik party moved Gramsci to write a letter to the [[Comintern]] in which he deplored the opposition led by [[Leon Trotsky]] but also underlined some presumed faults of the leader</span>
				<span class='text'>Togliatti, in Moscow as a representative of the party, received the letter, opened it, read it, and decided not to deliver it</span>
				<span class='text'>This caused a difficult conflict between Gramsci and Togliatti which they never completely resolved</span>

				<span class='text'>=Thought==Gramsci was one of the most important Marxist thinkers of the 20th century, and a particularly key thinker in the development of [[Western Marxism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote more than 30 notebooks and 3000 pages of history and analysis during his imprisonment</span>
				<span class='text'>These writings, known as the ''[[Prison Notebooks]]'', contain Gramsci's tracing of [[History of Italy|Italian history]] and nationalism, as well as some ideas in [[Marxist theory]], [[critical theory]] and educational theory associated with his name, such as:*[[Cultural hegemony]] as a means of maintaining and legitimising the capitalist state;*The need for popular workers' education to encourage development of intellectuals from the working class;*An analysis of the modern capitalist state that distinguishes between political society, which dominates directly and coercively, and [[civil society]], where leadership is constituted by means of consent;*&quot;Absolute [[historicism]]&quot;;*A critique of [[economic determinism]] that opposes [[fatalism|fatalistic]] interpretations of Marxism;*A critique of [[materialism|philosophical materialism]]</span>

				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15–17}} Gramsci greatly expanded this concept, developing an acute analysis of how the ruling capitalist class – the [[bourgeoisie]] – establishes and maintains its control</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=NLR /&gt;{{rp|20}}Orthodox Marxism had predicted that socialist revolution was inevitable in capitalist societies</span>
				<span class='text'>By the early 20th century, no such revolution had occurred in the most advanced nations</span>
				<span class='text'>Capitalism, it seemed, was even more entrenched than ever</span>
				<span class='text'>Capitalism, Gramsci suggested, maintained control not just through violence and political and economic coercion, but also through [[ideology]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[bourgeoisie]] developed a hegemonic culture, which propagated its own values and norms so that they became the &quot;[[common sense]]&quot; values of all</span>
				<span class='text'>People in the working-class (and other classes) identified their own good with the good of the bourgeoisie, and helped to maintain the ''status quo'' rather than revolting</span>
				<span class='text'>o counter the notion that bourgeois values represented &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;normal&quot; values for society, the working class needed to develop a culture of its own</span>
				<span class='text'>Lenin held that culture was &quot;ancillary&quot; to political objectives, but for Gramsci it was fundamental to the attainment of power that ''[[cultural hegemony]]'' be achieved first</span>
				<span class='text'>In Gramsci's view, a class cannot dominate in modern conditions by merely advancing its own narrow economic interests; neither can it dominate purely through force and coercion</span>
				<span class='text'>Rather, it must exert intellectual and moral leadership, and make alliances and compromises with a variety of forces</span>
				<span class='text'>Gramsci calls this union of social forces a &quot;historic bloc&quot;, taking a term from [[Georges Sorel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This bloc forms the basis of consent to a certain social order, which produces and re-produces the hegemony of the dominant class through a nexus of institutions, [[social relations]], and ideas</span>
				<span class='text'>In this way, Gramsci's theory emphasized the importance of the political and ideological [[base and superstructure|superstructure]] in both maintaining and fracturing relations of the economic base</span>
				<span class='text'>ramsci stated that bourgeois cultural values were tied to [[folklore]], popular culture and religion, and therefore much of his analysis of hegemonic culture is aimed at these</span>
				<span class='text'>He was also impressed by the influence [[Roman Catholicism]] had and the care the Church had taken to prevent an excessive gap developing between the religion of the learned and that of the less educated</span>
				<span class='text'>Gramsci saw Marxism as a marriage of the purely intellectual critique of religion found in [[Renaissance humanism]] and the elements of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] that had appealed to the masses</span>
				<span class='text'>For Gramsci, Marxism could supersede religion only if it met people's spiritual needs, and to do so people would have to think of it as an expression of their own experience</span>
				<span class='text'>or Gramsci, hegemonic dominance ultimately relied on a &quot;consented&quot; coercion, and in a &quot;crisis of authority&quot; the &quot;masks of consent&quot; slip away, revealing the fist of force</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=May 2015}}===Intellectuals and education===Gramsci gave much thought to the role of intellectuals in society</span>
				<span class='text'>Famously, he stated that all men are intellectuals, in that all have intellectual and rational faculties, but not all men have the social function of intellectuals</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gramsci, Antonio</span>

				<span class='text'>Lawrence and Wishart: 1982</span>
				<span class='text'>ISBN 0-85315-280-2</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He saw modern intellectuals not as talkers, but as practically-minded directors and organisers who produced hegemony through ideological apparatuses such as education and the media</span>
				<span class='text'>Furthermore, he distinguished between a &quot;traditional&quot; [[intelligentsia]] which sees itself (wrongly) as a class apart from society, and the thinking groups which every class produces from its own ranks &quot;organically&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Such &quot;organic&quot; intellectuals do not simply describe social life in accordance with scientific rules, but instead [[articulation (sociology)|articulate]], through the language of culture, the feelings and experiences which the masses could not express for themselves</span>
				<span class='text'>The need to create a [[working-class culture]] relates to Gramsci's call for a kind of education that could develop working-class intellectuals, whose task was not to introduce Marxist ideology from without the proletariat, but to renovate the existing intellectual activity of the masses and make it critical of the ''status quo'' </span>
				<span class='text'>His ideas about an education system for this purpose correspond with the notion of [[critical pedagogy]] and [[popular education]] as theorized and practised in later decades by [[Paulo Freire]] in Brazil, and have much in common with the thought of [[Frantz Fanon]]</span>
				<span class='text'>For this reason, partisans of adult and popular education consider Gramsci an important voice to this day</span>
				<span class='text'>==State and civil society===Gramsci's theory of hegemony is tied to his conception of the capitalist state</span>
				<span class='text'>Gramsci does not understand the 'state' in the narrow sense of the government</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, he divides it between 'political society' (the police, the army, legal system, etc</span>
				<span class='text'> – the arena of political institutions and legal constitutional control – and '[[civil society]]' (the family, the education system, trade unions, etc</span>
				<span class='text'> – commonly seen as the 'private' or 'non-state' sphere, mediating between the state and the economy</span>
				<span class='text'>He stresses, however, that the division is purely conceptual and that the two, in reality, often overlap</span>

				<span class='text'>ISBN 0-7178-0397-X</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The capitalist state, Gramsci claims, rules through force plus consent: political society is the realm of force and civil society is the realm of consent</span>
				<span class='text'>ramsci proffers that under modern capitalism, the [[bourgeoisie]] can maintain its economic control by allowing certain demands made by trade unions and mass political parties within civil society to be met by the political sphere</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, the bourgeoisie engages in [[passive revolution]] by going beyond its immediate economic interests and allowing the forms of its hegemony to change</span>
				<span class='text'>Gramsci posits that movements such as [[reformism]] and fascism, as well as the '[[scientific management]]' and [[assembly line]] methods of [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|Frederick Taylor]] and [[Henry Ford]], respectively, are examples of this</span>
				<span class='text'>rawing from [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]], he argues that 'The Modern Prince' – the revolutionary party – is the force that will allow the working-class to develop organic intellectuals and an alternative hegemony within civil society</span>
				<span class='text'>For Gramsci, the complex nature of modern civil society means that a 'war of position', carried out by revolutionaries through political agitation, the trade unions, advancement of [[proletarian culture]], and other ways to create an opposing civil society was necessary alongside a 'war of manoeuvre' – a direct revolution – in order to have a successful revolution without a danger of a counter-revolution or degeneration</span>
				<span class='text'>espite his claim that the lines between the two may be blurred, Gramsci rejects the state-worship that results from identifying political society with civil society, as was done by the [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]] and Fascists</span>
				<span class='text'>He believes the proletariat's historical task is to create a 'regulated society' and defines the '[[withering away of the state]]' as the full development of civil society's ability to regulate itself</span>
				<span class='text'>==Historicism===Gramsci, like the early [[Karl Marx|Marx]], was an emphatic proponent of [[historicism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gramsci, Antonio</span>

				<span class='text'>Lawrence and Wishart: 1982</span>
				<span class='text'>ISBN 0-85315-280-2</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In Gramsci's view, all meaning derives from the relation between human practical activity (or &quot;[[praxis (process)|praxis]]&quot;) and the &quot;objective&quot; historical and social processes of which it is a part</span>
				<span class='text'>Ideas cannot be understood outside their social and historical context, apart from their function and origin</span>
				<span class='text'>The concepts by which we organise our knowledge of the world do not derive primarily from our relation to things (to an objective reality), but rather from the social (economic, for Marx) relations between the bearers of those concepts</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, there is no such thing as an unchanging &quot;[[human nature]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Furthermore, philosophy and science do not &quot;reflect&quot; a reality independent of man</span>
				<span class='text'>Rather, a theory can be said to be &quot;true&quot; when, in any given historical situation, it expresses the real developmental trend of that situation</span>
				<span class='text'>or the majority of Marxists, truth was truth no matter when and where it is known, and scientific knowledge (which included Marxism) accumulated historically as the advance of truth in this everyday sense</span>
				<span class='text'>On this view, Marxism (or the Marxist theory of history and economics) could be said to belong to the (largely) illusory realm of the superstructure because it is a science</span>
				<span class='text'>In contrast, Gramsci believed Marxism was &quot;true&quot; in a socially pragmatic sense: by articulating the [[class consciousness]] of the [[proletariat]], Marxism expressed the &quot;truth&quot; of its times better than any other theory</span>
				<span class='text'>This anti-[[scientism|scientistic]] and anti-[[positivism|positivist]] stance was indebted to the influence of Benedetto Croce</span>
				<span class='text'>However, it should be underlined that Gramsci's &quot;absolute historicism&quot; broke with Croce's tendency to secure a metaphysical synthesis in historical &quot;destiny&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Though Gramsci repudiates the charge, his historical account of truth has been criticised as a form of [[relativism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=December 2015}}===Critique of &quot;economism&quot;===In a notable pre-prison article entitled &quot;The Revolution against {{italics correction|''[[Das Kapital]]''}}&quot;, Gramsci wrote that the [[October Revolution]] in Russia had invalidated the idea that socialist revolution had to await the full development of capitalist [[productive forces|forces of production]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This reflected his view that Marxism was not a [[determinism|determinist]] philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>The principle of the causal &quot;primacy&quot; of the [[forces of production]], he held, was a misconception of Marxism</span>
				<span class='text'>Both economic changes and cultural changes are expressions of a &quot;basic historical process&quot;, and it is difficult to say which sphere has primacy over the other</span>
				<span class='text'>The belief, widespread within the [[labour movement|workers' movement]] in its earliest years, that it would inevitably triumph due to &quot;historical laws&quot;, was, in Gramsci's view, a product of the historical circumstances of an oppressed class restricted mainly to defensive action</span>
				<span class='text'>Such a [[fatalism|fatalistic]] doctrine was to be abandoned as a hindrance once the working-class became able to take the initiative</span>
				<span class='text'>Because Marxism is a &quot;philosophy of praxis&quot;, it cannot rely on unseen &quot;historical laws&quot; as the agents of social change</span>
				<span class='text'>History is defined by human praxis and therefore includes human will</span>
				<span class='text'>Nonetheless, will-power cannot achieve anything it likes in any given situation: when the consciousness of the working-class reaches the stage of development necessary for action, it will encounter historical circumstances that cannot be arbitrarily altered</span>
				<span class='text'>However, it is not predetermined by historical inevitability or &quot;destiny&quot; as to which of several possible developments will take place as a result</span>
				<span class='text'>is critique of [[Economic determinism|economism]] also extended to that practised by the syndicalists of the Italian trade unions</span>
				<span class='text'>He believed that many trade unionists had settled for a reformist, gradualist approach in that they had refused to struggle on the political front in addition to the economic front</span>
				<span class='text'>For Gramsci, much as the ruling class can look beyond its own immediate economic interests to reorganise the forms of its own hegemony, so must the working-class present its own interests as congruous with the universal advancement of society</span>
				<span class='text'>While Gramsci envisioned the trade unions as one organ of a counter-hegemonic force in capitalist society, the trade union leaders simply saw these organizations as a means to improve conditions within the existing structure</span>
				<span class='text'>Gramsci referred to the views of these trade unionists as &quot;vulgar economism&quot;, which he equated to covert reformism and even liberalism</span>
				<span class='text'>==Critique of materialism===By virtue of his belief that human history and collective praxis determine whether any philosophical question is meaningful or not, Gramsci's views run contrary to the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] [[materialism]] and 'copy' theory of perception advanced by [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]]&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Engels: [http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; though he does not explicitly state this</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Gramsci resigned himself to the existence of this arguably cruder form of Marxism</span>
				<span class='text'>Marxism was a philosophy for the proletariat, a subaltern class, and thus could often only be expressed in the form of popular superstition and common sense</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, it was necessary to effectively challenge the ideologies of the educated classes, and to do so Marxists must present their philosophy in a more sophisticated guise, and attempt to genuinely understand their opponents’ views</span>
				<span class='text'>=Influence==Gramsci's thought emanates from the organized left, but he has also become an important figure in current academic discussions within [[cultural studies]] and [[critical theory]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Political theorists from the center and the right have also found insight in his concepts; his idea of hegemony, for example, has become widely cited</span>
				<span class='text'>His influence is particularly strong in contemporary [[political science]] (see [[Neo-gramscianism]])</span>
				<span class='text'>His work also heavily influenced intellectual discourse on popular culture and scholarly [[popular culture studies]] in which many have found the potential for political or ideological resistance to dominant government and business interests</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=December 2014}}His critics charge him with fostering a notion of power struggle through ideas</span>
				<span class='text'>They find the Gramscian approach to philosophical analysis, reflected in current academic controversies, to be in conflict with open-ended, liberal inquiry grounded in apolitical readings of the classics of Western culture</span>
				<span class='text'>Gramscians would counter that thoughts of &quot;liberal inquiry&quot; and &quot;apolitical reading&quot; are utterly naive; for the Gramscians, these are intellectual devices used to maintain the hegemony of the capitalist class</span>
				<span class='text'>To credit or blame Gramsci for the travails of current academic politics is an odd turn of history, since Gramsci himself was never an academic, and was in fact deeply intellectually engaged with Italian culture, history, and current liberal thought</span>
				<span class='text'>s a socialist, Gramsci's legacy has been disputed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=NLR /&gt;{{rp|6–7}} Togliatti, who led the Party (renamed as [[Italian Communist Party]], PCI) after World War II and whose gradualist approach was a forerunner to [[Eurocommunism]], claimed that the PCI's practices during this period were congruent with Gramscian thought</span>
				<span class='text'>Others, however, have argued that Gramsci was a [[Left Communism|Left Communist]], who would likely have been expelled from his Party if prison had not prevented him from regular contact with Moscow during the leadership of [[Joseph Stalin]]</span>
