				<span class='text'>Adorno''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|d|ɔr|n|oʊ}};&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford Dictionary of English]]''&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-de|aˈdɔʀno|lang}}; born '''Theodor Ludwig Wiesengrund'''; September 11, 1903&amp;nbsp;– August 6, 1969) was a German [[philosopher]], [[sociology|sociologist]], and composer known for his [[critical theory]] of society</span>
				<span class='text'>e was a leading member of the [[Frankfurt School]] of critical theory, whose work has come to be associated with thinkers such as [[Ernst Bloch]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Max Horkheimer]] and [[Herbert Marcuse]], for whom the work of [[Freud]], [[Marx]] and [[Hegel]] were essential to a critique of modern society</span>
				<span class='text'>He is widely regarded as one of the 20th century's foremost thinkers on aesthetics and philosophy, as well as one of its preeminent essayists</span>
				<span class='text'>As a critic of both fascism and what he called the [[culture industry]], his writings—such as ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'' (1947), ''[[Minima Moralia]]'' (1951) and ''[[Negative Dialectics]]'' (1966)—strongly influenced the European [[New Left]]</span>
				<span class='text'>midst the vogue enjoyed by [[existentialism]] and [[positivism]] in early 20th-century Europe, Adorno advanced a dialectical conception of natural history that critiqued the twin temptations of [[ontology]] and [[empiricism]] through studies of [[Kierkegaard]] and [[Husserl]]</span>
				<span class='text'>As a classically trained pianist whose sympathies with the twelve-tone technique of [[Arnold Schoenberg]] resulted in his studying composition with [[Alban Berg]] of the [[Second Viennese School]], Adorno's commitment to avant-garde music formed the backdrop of his subsequent writings and led to his collaboration with [[Thomas Mann]] on the latter's novel ''[[Doctor Faustus (Thomas Mann novel)|Doctor Faustus]]'', while the two men lived in California as exiles during the Second World War</span>
				<span class='text'>Working for the newly relocated [[Institute for Social Research]], Adorno collaborated on influential studies of [[authoritarianism]], [[antisemitism]] and [[propaganda]] that would later serve as models for sociological studies the Institute carried out in post-war Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>pon his return to Frankfurt, Adorno was involved with the reconstitution of German intellectual life through debates with [[Karl Popper]] on the limitations of positivist science, critiques of [[Heidegger]]'s language of authenticity, writings on German responsibility for [[the Holocaust]], and continued interventions into matters of public policy</span>
				<span class='text'>As a writer of polemics in the tradition of [[Nietzsche]] and [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]], Adorno delivered scathing critiques of contemporary Western culture</span>
				<span class='text'>Adorno's posthumously published ''[[Aesthetic Theory]]'', which he planned to dedicate to [[Samuel Beckett]], is the culmination of a lifelong commitment to modern art which attempts to revoke the &quot;fatal separation&quot; of feeling and understanding long demanded by the history of philosophy and explode the privilege aesthetics accords to content over form and contemplation over immersion</span>
				<span class='text'>=Life and career=====Early years: Frankfurt===Theodor W</span>
				<span class='text'>Adorno (alias: Theodor Adorno-Wiesengrund) was born as Theodor Ludwig Wiesengrund in [[Frankfurt am Main]] on September 11, 1903, the only child of Oscar Alexander Wiesengrund (1870–1946) and Maria Calvelli-Adorno della Piana (1865–1952)</span>
				<span class='text'>His mother, a devout Catholic from [[Corsica]], was once a professional singer, while his father, an assimilated Jew who had converted to Protestantism, ran a successful wine-export business</span>
				<span class='text'>Proud of her origins, Maria wanted her son's paternal surname to be supplemented by the addition of her own name: Adorno</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus his earliest publications carried the name Theodor Wiesengrund-Adorno; upon his application for US citizenship, his name was modified to Theodor W</span>
				<span class='text'>Adorno</span>
				<span class='text'>His childhood was marked by the musical life provided by his mother and aunt: Maria was a singer who could boast of having performed in Vienna at the Imperial Court, while her sister, Agathe, who lived with them, had made a name for herself as both a singer and pianist</span>
				<span class='text'>He was not only a precocious child but, as he recalled later in life, a child prodigy who could play pieces by [[Beethoven]] on the piano by the time he was twelve</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;At the age of six, he attended the Deutschherren middle school before transferring to the Kaiser-Wilhelm Gymnasium, where he studied from 1913 to 1921</span>
				<span class='text'>Prior to his graduation at the top of his class, Adorno was already swept up by the revolutionary mood of the time, as is evidenced by his reading of [[Georg Lukács]]'s ''The Theory of the Novel'' that year, as well as by his fascination with [[Ernst Bloch]]'s ''The Spirit of Utopia'', of which he would later write:{{quote|Bloch's was a philosophy that could hold its head high before the most advanced literature; a philosophy that was not calibrated to the abominable resignation of methodology </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>I took this motif so much as my own that I do not believe I have ever written anything without reference to it, either implicit or explicit</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Adorno|1992|page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}Yet Adorno's intellectual nonconformism was no less shaped by the repugnance he felt towards the nationalism which swept through the Reich during the [[First World War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Along with future collaborators like [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Max Horkheimer]], and Ernst Bloch, Adorno was profoundly disillusioned by the ease with which Germany's intellectual and spiritual leaders—among them [[Max Weber]], [[Max Scheler]], [[Georg Simmel]], as well as his friend [[Siegfried Kracauer]]—came out in support of the war</span>
				<span class='text'>The younger generation's distrust for traditional knowledge arose from the way in which this tradition had discredited itself</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Claussen|2008|page=66–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over time, Oscar Wiesengrund's firm established close professional and personal ties with the factory of Karplus &amp; Herzberger in Berlin</span>
				<span class='text'>The eldest daughter of the Karplus family, Margarete, or Gretel, moved in the intellectual circles of Berlin, where she was acquainted with Walter Benjamin, [[Bertolt Brecht]] and Ernst Bloch, each of whom Adorno would become familiar with during the mid-20s; after fourteen years, Gretel and Theodor were married in 1937</span>
				<span class='text'>At the end of his schooldays, Adorno not only benefited from the rich concert offerings of Frankfurt—where one could hear performances of works by Schoenberg, [[Schreker]], [[Stravinsky]], [[Bartók]], [[Busoni]], [[Frederick Delius|Delius]] and [[Hindemith]]—but also began studying music composition at the [[Hoch Conservatory]] while taking private lessons with well-respected composers [[Bernhard Sekles]] and Eduard Jung</span>
				<span class='text'>At around the same time, he befriended Siegfried Kracauer, the ''[[Frankfurter Zeitung]]'''s literary editor, of whom he would later write:{{quote|For years Kracauer read [Kant's] ''Critique of Pure Reason'' with me regularly on Saturday afternoons</span>
				<span class='text'>I am not exaggerating in the slightest when I say that I owe more to this reading than to my academic teachers </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Under his guidance I experienced the work from the beginning not as mere epistemology, not as an analysis of the conditions of scientifically valid judgments, but as a kind of coded text from which the historical situation of spirit could be read, with the vague expectation that in doing so one could acquire something of truth itself</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Adorno|1992|page=58–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{| class=&quot;infobox plainlist&quot;|+ Academic Genealogy! Notable teachers|-|* [[Hans Cornelius]]|-! Notable students|-|* [[Jürgen Habermas]]|}Leaving gymnasium to study philosophy, psychology and sociology at [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University]] in Frankfurt, Adorno continued his readings with [[Kracauer]], turning now to [[Hegel]] and [[Kierkegaard]], and began publishing concert reviews and pieces of music for distinguished journals like the ''Zeitschrift für Musik'', the ''Neue Blätter für Kunst und Literatur'' and later for the ''Musikblätter des Anbruch''</span>
				<span class='text'>In these articles, Adorno championed avant-garde music at the same time as he critiqued the failings of musical modernity, as in the case of Stravinsky's ''[[Histoire du soldat|The Soldier's Tale]]'', which he called in 1923 a &quot;dismal Bohemian prank</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In these early writings, he was unequivocal in his condemnation of performances which either sought or pretended to achieve a transcendence which Adorno, in line with many intellectuals of the time, regarded as impossible: &quot;No cathedral,&quot; he wrote, &quot;can be built if no community desires one</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In the summer of 1924, Adorno received his doctorate with a study of [[Edmund Husserl]] under the direction of the unorthodox neo-Kantian [[Hans Cornelius]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Before his graduation, Adorno had already met with his most important intellectual collaborators, [[Max Horkheimer]] and [[Walter Benjamin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Through Cornelius's seminars, Adorno met his future collaborator Max Horkheimer, through whom he was then introduced to [[Friedrich Pollock]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==Vienna, Frankfurt, and Berlin===During the summer of 1924, the Viennese composer [[Alban Berg]]'s Three Fragments from [[Wozzeck]], op</span>
				<span class='text'>7 premiered in Frankfurt, at which time Adorno introduced himself to Berg and both agreed the young philosopher and composer would study with Berg in Vienna</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon moving to Vienna in February 1925, Adorno immersed himself in the musical culture which had grown up around Schoenberg: in addition to his twice-weekly sessions with Berg, Adorno continued his studies on piano with [[Eduard Steuermann]] and befriended the violinist [[Rudolf Kolisch]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In Vienna, he attended public lectures of the satirist [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]] with Berg and met [[Lukács]], who had been living in Vienna after the failure of the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Alban Berg, the man Adorno referred to as &quot;my master and teacher,&quot; was among the most prescient of his young pupil's early friends:{{quote|[I am] convinced that, in the sphere of the deepest understanding of music </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>you are capable of supreme achievements and will undoubtedly fulfill this promise in the shape of great philosophical works</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}After leaving Vienna, Adorno traveled through Italy, where he met with [[Kracauer]], Benjamin, and the economist [[Alfred Sohn-Rethel]], with whom he developed a lasting friendship, before returning to Frankfurt</span>
				<span class='text'>In December 1926 Adorno's &quot;Two Pieces for String Quartet,&quot; op</span>
				<span class='text'> were performed in Vienna, which provided a welcome interruption from his preparations for the [[Habilitation]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After writing the &quot;Piano Pieces in strict twelve-tone technique,&quot; as well as songs later integrated into the ''Six Bagatelles for Voice and Piano'', op</span>
				<span class='text'>6, Adorno presented his [[Habilitation]] manuscript, ''The Concept of the Unconscious in the Transcendental Theory of the Psyche'', to [[Hans Cornelius|Cornelius]] in November 1927</span>
				<span class='text'>Cornelius advised Adorno to withdraw his application on the grounds that the manuscript was too close to his own way of thinking</span>
				<span class='text'>In this manuscript, Adorno attempted to underline the epistemological status of the [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]] as it emerged from [[Freud]]'s early writings</span>
				<span class='text'>Against the function of the unconscious in both [[Nietzsche]] and [[Spengler]], Adorno argued that Freud's notion of the unconscious serves as a &quot;sharp weapon </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>against every attempt to create a metaphysics of the instincts and to deify full, organic nature</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Undaunted by his academic prospects, Adorno threw himself once again into composition</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition to publishing numerous  reviews of opera performances and concerts, Adorno's &quot;Four Songs for Medium Voice and Piano&quot;, op</span>
				<span class='text'> was performed in Berlin in January 1929</span>
				<span class='text'>Between 1928 and 1930 Adorno took on a greater role within the editorial committee of the ''Musikblätter des Anbruch''</span>
				<span class='text'>In a proposal for transforming the journal, Adorno sought to use ''Anbruch'' for championing radical modern music against what he called the &quot;stabilized music&quot; of [[Hans Pfitzner|Pfitzner]], the later [[Strauss]], as well as the [[neoclassicism]] of [[Stravinsky]] and [[Hindemith]]</span>
				<span class='text'>During this period he published the essays &quot;Night Music&quot;, &quot;On Twelve-Tone Technique&quot; and &quot;Reaction and Progress&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet his reservations about twelve-tone orthodoxy became steadily more pronounced: According to Adorno, [[twelve-tone technique]]'s use of [[atonality]] can no more be regarded as an authoritative canon than can [[tonality]] be relied on to provide instructions for the composer</span>
				<span class='text'>t this time, Adorno struck up a correspondence with the composer [[Ernst Krenek]], with whom he discussed problems of atonality and twelve-tone technique</span>
				<span class='text'>In a letter of 1934 Adorno sounded a related criticism of Schoenberg:{{quote|Twelve-tone technique alone is nothing but the principle of motivic elaboration and variation, as developed in the sonata, but elevated now to a comprehensive principle of construction, namely transformed into an ''a priori'' form and, by that token, detached from the surface of the composition</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}At this point Adorno reversed his earlier priorities: now his musical activities came second to the development of a philosophical theory of aesthetics</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, in the middle of 1929 he accepted [[Paul Tillich]]'s offer to present an Habilitation on [[Kierkegaard]], which Adorno eventually submitted under the title ''The Construction of the Aesthetic''</span>
				<span class='text'>At the time, [[Kierkegaard]]'s philosophy exerted a strong influence, chiefly through its claim to pose an alternative to [[Idealism]] and [[Hegel]]'s philosophy of history</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet when Adorno turned his attention to [[Kierkegaard]], watchwords like &quot;anxiety,&quot; &quot;inwardness&quot; and &quot;leap&quot;—instructive for [[Existentialism|existentialist philosophy]]—were detached from their theological origins and posed, instead, as problems for aesthetics</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the work proceeded—and [[Kierkegaard]]'s overcoming of [[Hegel]]'s idealism was revealed to be a mere interiorization—Adorno excitedly remarked in a letter to [[Alban Berg|Berg]] that he was writing without looking over his shoulder at the faculty who would soon evaluate his work</span>
				<span class='text'>Receiving favorable reports from Professors [[Tillich]] and [[Horkheimer]], as well as [[Benjamin]] and [[Kracauer]], the University conferred on Adorno the ''[[venia legendi]]'' in February 1931; on the very day his revised study was published, 23 March 1933, [[Hitler]] seized dictatorial powers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;Several months after qualifying as a lecturer in philosophy, Adorno delivered an inaugural lecture at the [[Institute for Social Research]], an independent organization which had recently appointed Horkheimer as its director and, with the arrival of the literary scholar [[Leo Lowenthal]], social psychologist [[Erich Fromm]] and philosopher [[Herbert Marcuse]], sought to exploit recent theoretical and methodological advances in the social sciences</span>
				<span class='text'>His lecture, &quot;The Actuality of Philosophy,&quot; created a scandal</span>
				<span class='text'>In it, Adorno not only deviated from the theoretical program [[Horkheimer]] had laid out a year earlier, but challenged philosophy's very capacity for comprehending reality as such: &quot;For the mind,&quot; Adorno announced, &quot;is indeed not capable of producing or grasping the totality of the real, but it may be possible to penetrate the detail, to explode in miniature the mass of merely existing reality</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Adorno|2000|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; In line with [[Walter Benjamin|Benjamin]]'s ''[[The Origin of German Tragic Drama]]'' and preliminary sketches of the [[Arcades Project]], Adorno likened philosophical interpretation to experiments which should be conducted &quot;until they arrive at figurations in which the answers are legible, while the questions themselves vanish</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Having lost its position as the Queen of the Sciences, philosophy must now radically transform its approach to objects so that it might &quot;construct keys before which reality springs open</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Adorno|2000|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;Following [[Horkheimer]]'s taking up the directorship of the Institute, a new journal, ''Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung'', was produced to publish the research of Institute members both before and after its relocation to the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>Though Adorno was not himself an Institute member, the journal nevertheless published many of his essays, including &quot;The Social Situation of Music&quot; (1932), &quot;On Jazz&quot; (1936), &quot;On the Fetish-Character in Music and the Regression of Listening&quot; (1938) and &quot;Fragments on Wagner&quot; (1938)</span>
				<span class='text'>In his new role as social theorist, Adorno's philosophical analysis of cultural phenomena heavily relied on the language of [[historical materialism]], as concepts like [[reification (Marxism)|reification]], [[false consciousness]] and [[ideology]] came to play an ever more prominent role in his work</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time, however, and owing to both the presence of another prominent sociologist at the Institute, [[Karl Mannheim]], as well as the methodological problem posed by treating objects—like &quot;musical material&quot;—as ciphers of social contradictions, Adorno was compelled to abandon any notion of &quot;value-free&quot; sociology in favor of a form of ideology critique which held on to an idea of truth</span>
				<span class='text'>Before his emigration in autumn 1934, Adorno began work on a ''Singspiel'' based on [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]'' entitled ''The Treasure of Indian Joe'', which he would, however, never complete; by the time he fled [[Hitler]]'s Germany Adorno had already written over a hundred opera or concert reviews and an additional fifty critiques of music composition</span>
				<span class='text'>s the [[Nazi]] party became the largest party in the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] [[Horkheimer]]'s 1932 observation proved chillingly prophetic: &quot;Only one thing is certain&quot;, he wrote, &quot;the irrationality of society has reached a point where only the gloomiest predictions have any plausibility</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September Adorno's right to teach was revoked; in March, as the [[swastika]] was run up the flag pole of town hall, the Institute's offices were searched by the Frankfurt criminal police</span>
				<span class='text'>Adorno's house on Seeheimer Strasse was similarly searched in July and his application for membership in the Reich Chamber of Literature was denied on the grounds that membership was limited to &quot;persons who belong to the German nation by profound ties of character and blood</span>
				<span class='text'>As a non-[[Aryan race|Aryan]],&quot; he was informed, &quot;you are unable to feel and appreciate such an obligation</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterwards Adorno was forced into fifteen years of exile</span>
				<span class='text'>==Exile: Oxford, New York, Los Angeles===After the possibility of transferring his [[habilitation]] to the [[University of Vienna]] came to nothing, Adorno considered relocating to Britain upon his father's suggestion</span>
				<span class='text'> With the help of the [[Academic Assistance Council]], Adorno registered as an advanced student at [[Merton College]], Oxford, in June 1934</span>
				<span class='text'>During the next four years at Oxford, Adorno made repeated trips to Germany to see both his parents and Gretel, who was still working in Berlin</span>
				<span class='text'>Under the direction of [[Gilbert Ryle]], Adorno worked on a dialectical critique of [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]]'s epistemology</span>
				<span class='text'>By this time, the [[Institute for Social Research]] had relocated to New York City and began making overtures to Adorno</span>
				<span class='text'>After months of strained relations, [[Max Horkheimer|Horkheimer]] and Adorno reestablished their essential theoretical alliance during meetings in Paris</span>
				<span class='text'>Adorno continued writing on music, publishing &quot;The Form of the Phonograph Record&quot; and &quot;Crisis of Music Criticism&quot; with the Viennese musical journal ''23'', &quot;On Jazz&quot; in the Institute's ''Zeitschrift'', &quot;Farewell to Jazz&quot; in ''Europäische Revue''</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet Adorno's attempts to break out of the sociology of music were, at this time, twice thwarted: neither the study of Mannheim he had been working on for years nor extracts from his study of Husserl were accepted by the ''Zeitschrift''</span>
				<span class='text'>Impressed by Horkheimer's book of aphorisms, ''Dawn and Decline'', Adorno began working on his own book of aphorisms, what would later become ''Minima Moralia''</span>
				<span class='text'>While at Oxford, Adorno suffered two great losses: his Aunt Agathe died in June 1935, while Alban Berg died in December of the same year</span>
				<span class='text'>To the end of his life, Adorno never abandoned the hope of completing [[Alban Berg|Berg]]'s unfinished [[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]</span>
				<span class='text'>t this time, Adorno was in intense correspondence with [[Walter Benjamin]] on the subject of the latter's ''[[Arcades Project]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>After receiving an invitation from Horkheimer to visit the Institute in New York, Adorno sailed for New York on June 9, 1937 and stayed there for two weeks</span>
				<span class='text'>While in New York, Max Horkheimer's essays &quot;The Latest Attack on Metaphysics&quot; and &quot;Traditional and Critical Theory,&quot; which would soon become instructive for the Institute's self-understanding, were the subject of intense discussion</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon after his return to Europe, Gretel moved to Britain, where she and Adorno were married on September 8, 1937; a little over a month later, Horkheimer telegrammed from New York with news of a position Adorno could take up with the [[Radio Project|Princeton Radio Project]], then under the directorship of the Austrian sociologist [[Paul Lazarsfeld]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet Adorno's work continued with studies of [[Beethoven]] and [[Richard Wagner]] (published in 1939 as &quot;Fragments on Wagner&quot;), drafts of which he read to Benjamin during their final meeting, in December on the Italian Riviera</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Benjamin, these drafts were astonishing for &quot;the precision of their materialist deciphering,&quot; as well as the way in which &quot;musical facts </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>had been made socially transparent in a way that was completely new to me</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=237, 239}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his Wagner study, the thesis later to characterize ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]''—man's domination of nature—first emerges</span>
				<span class='text'>Adorno sailed for New York on February 16, 1938</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon after settling into his new home on Riverside Drive, Adorno met with Lazarsfeld in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] to discuss the Project's plans for investigating the impact of broadcast music</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough he was expected to embed the Project's research within a wider theoretical context, it soon became apparent that the Project was primarily concerned with [[data collection]] to be used by administrators for establishing whether groups of listeners could be targeted by broadcasts specifically aimed at them</span>
				<span class='text'>Expected to make use of devices with which listeners could press a button to indicate whether they liked or disliked a particular piece of music, Adorno bristled with distaste and astonishment:  &quot;I reflected that culture was simply the condition that precluded a mentality that tried to measure it</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Adorno suggested using individual interviews to determine listener reactions and, only three months after meeting Lazarsfeld, completed a 160-page memorandum on the Project's topic, &quot;Music in Radio</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Adorno was primarily interested in how the musical material was affected by its distribution through the medium of radio and thought it imperative to understand how music was affected by its becoming part of daily life</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;The meaning of a Beethoven symphony,&quot; he wrote, &quot;heard while the listener is walking around or lying in bed is very likely to differ from its effect in a concert-hall where people sit as if they were in church</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; In essays published by the Institute's ''Zeitschrift'', Adorno dealt with that atrophy of musical culture which had become instrumental in accelerating tendencies—towards [[conformity|conformism]], trivialization and standardization—already present in the larger culture</span>
				<span class='text'>Unsurprisingly, Adorno's studies found little resonance among members of the project</span>
				<span class='text'>At the end of 1939, when Lazarsfeld submitted a second application for funding, the musical section of the study was duly left out</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet during the two years during which he worked on the Project, Adorno was nevertheless prolific, publishing &quot;The Radio Symphony,&quot; &quot;A Social Critique of Radio Music&quot; and &quot;On Popular Music,&quot; texts which, along with the draft memorandum and other unpublished writings, which are now found in Robert Hullot-Kentor's recent translation, ''Current of Music''</span>
				<span class='text'>In light of this situation, Horkheimer soon found a permanent post for Adorno at the Institute</span>
				<span class='text'>n addition to helping with the ''Zeitschrift'' Adorno was expected to be the Institute's liaison with Benjamin, who soon passed on to New York the study of [[Charles Baudelaire]] he hoped would serve as a model of the larger ''Arcades Project''</span>
				<span class='text'>In correspondence, the two men discussed the difference in their conceptions of the relationship between critique and artworks which had become manifest through Benjamin's &quot;[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction|The Work of Art in the Age of its Technical Reproducibility]]</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; At around the same time Adorno and Horkheimer began planning for a joint work on &quot;dialectical logic,&quot; which would later become ''Dialectic of Enlightenment''</span>
				<span class='text'>Alarmed by reports from Europe, where Adorno's parents suffered increasing discrimination and Benjamin was interned in [[Colombes]], their joint study could entertain few delusions about its practical effects</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;In view of what is now threatening to engulf Europe,&quot; Horkheimer wrote, &quot;our present work is essentially destined to pass things down through the night that is approaching: a kind of message in a bottle&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Adorno continued his work in New York with radio talks on music and a lecture on Søren Kierkegaard's doctrine of love, Benjamin fled Paris and attempted to make an illegal border crossing</span>
				<span class='text'>After learning that his Spanish visa was invalid and fearing deportation back to France, Benjamin took an overdose of morphine tablets</span>
				<span class='text'>In light of recent events, the Institute set about formulating a theory of antisemitism and fascism</span>
				<span class='text'>On one side were those who supported [[Franz Leopold Neumann|Franz Neumann]]'s thesis according to which [[National Socialism]] was a form of &quot;[[monopoly capitalism|monopoly capital]]&quot;; on the other were those who supported [[Friedrich Pollock|Friedrich Pollock's]] &quot;[[state capitalist]] theory</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; [[Max Horkheimer|Horkheimer]]'s contributions to this debate, in the form of the essays &quot;The Authoritarian State,&quot; &quot;The End of Reason&quot; and &quot;The Jews and Europe&quot; served as a foundation for what he and Adorno planned to do in their book on dialectical logic</span>
				<span class='text'>n November 1941 Adorno followed [[Max Horkheimer|Horkheimer]] to what [[Thomas Mann]] called &quot;German California,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Claussen|2008|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; setting up house in a [[Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles|Pacific Palisades]] neighborhood of German émigrés which included [[Bertolt Brecht]] and Arnold Schoenberg</span>
				<span class='text'>Adorno arrived with  a draft of his ''Philosophy of New Music'', a dialectical critique of twelve-tone music, which Adorno himself felt, while writing, was already a departure from the theory of art he had spent the previous decades elaborating</span>
				<span class='text'>Horkheimer's reaction to the manuscript was wholly positive: &quot;If I have ever in the whole of my life felt enthusiasm about anything, then I did on this occasion,&quot; he wrote after reading the manuscript</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=275}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two set about completing their joint work, which transformed itself from a book on dialectical logic to a rewriting of the history of rationality and the Enlightenment</span>
				<span class='text'>First published in a small mimeographed edition in May 1944 as ''Philosophical Fragments'', the text would wait another three years before achieving book form when it was published with its definitive title, ''Dialectic of Enlightenment,'' by the Amsterdam publisher Querido Verlag</span>
				<span class='text'>This &quot;reflection on the destructive aspect of progress&quot; proceeded through the chapters which treated rationality as both the liberation from and further domination of nature, interpretations of both [[Homer]]'s [[Odyssey]] and the [[Marquis de Sade]], as well as analyses of the culture industry and antisemitism</span>
				<span class='text'>ith their joint work completed, the two turned their attention to studies on antisemitism and authoritarianism in collaboration with the [[Nevitt Sanford]]-led Public Opinion Study Group and the [[American Jewish Committee]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In line with these studies, Adorno produced an analysis of the Californian radio preacher Martin Luther Thomas</span>
				<span class='text'>Fascist propaganda of this sort, Adorno wrote, &quot;simply takes people for what they are: genuine children of today's standardized mass culture who have been robbed to a great extent of their autonomy and spontaneity&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=293}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result of these labors, the 1950 study [[The Authoritarian Personality]] was pioneering in its combination of quantitative and qualitative methods of collecting and evaluating data as well as its development of the [[F-scale (personality test)|F-scale]]</span>
				<span class='text'>fter the USA entered the war in 1941, the situation of the émigrés, now classed &quot;[[enemy aliens]]&quot; became increasingly precarious as government measures turned from anti-Nazism to [[anti-communism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Forbidden from leaving their homes between 8pm and 6am and prohibited from going more than five miles from their houses, émigrés like Adorno, who would not be naturalized until November 1943, were severely restricted in their movements</span>
				<span class='text'>n addition to the aphorisms which conclude ''Dialectic of Enlightenment'', Adorno put together a collection of aphorisms in honor of Horkheimer's fiftieth birthday that would later be published as ''Minima Moralia: Reflections from Damaged Life''</span>
				<span class='text'>These fragmentary writings, inspired by a renewed reading of [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], treated issues like [[emigration]], [[totalitarianism]] and [[individuality]], as well as everyday matters such as giving presents, dwelling and the impossibility of love</span>
				<span class='text'>In California, Adorno made the acquaintance of [[Charlie Chaplin]] and became friends with [[Fritz Lang]] and [[Hanns Eisler]], with whom he completed a study of film music in 1944</span>
				<span class='text'>In this study, the authors pushed for the greater usage of avant-garde music in film, urging that music be used to supplement, not simply accompany, the visual aspect of films</span>
				<span class='text'>Additionally, Adorno assisted [[Thomas Mann]] on his novel ''[[Doktor Faustus|Doctor Faustus]]'' after the latter asked for his help</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Would you be willing,&quot; Mann wrote, &quot;to think through with me how the work—I mean Leverkühn's work—might look; how you would do it if you were in league with the Devil?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=316}}&lt;/ref&gt;At the end of October 1949, Adorno left America for Europe just as ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'' was being published</span>
				<span class='text'>Before his return, Adorno had not only reached an agreement with a Tübingen publisher to print an expanded version of ''Philosophy of New Music'', but completed two compositions: ''Four Songs for Voice and Piano by Stefan George, op</span>
				<span class='text'>'', and ''Three Choruses for Female Voices from the Poems of Theodor Däubler, op</span>
				<span class='text'>8''</span>
				<span class='text'>==Post-war Europe=======Return to Frankfurt University====Upon his return, Adorno helped shape the political culture of West Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>Until his death in 1969, twenty years after his return, Adorno contributed to the intellectual foundations of the Federal Republic, as a professor at [[Goethe University Frankfurt|Frankfurt University]], critic of the vogue enjoyed by Heideggerian philosophy, partisan of critical sociology and teacher of music at the [[Darmstadt International Summer Courses for New Music]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Adorno resumed his teaching duties at the university soon after his arrival,{{when|date=September 2012}} with seminars on &quot;Kant's Transcendental Dialectic,&quot; aesthetics, Hegel, &quot;Contemporary Problems in the Theory of Knowledge&quot; and &quot;The Concept of Knowledge</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Adorno's surprise at his students' passionate interest in intellectual matters did not, however, blind him to continuing problems within Germany: The literary climate was dominated by writers who had remained in Germany during Hitler's rule, the government re-employed people who had been active in the Nazi apparatus and people were generally loath to own up to their own collaboration or the guilt they thus incurred</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, the ruined city of Frankfurt continued as if nothing had happened,{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} holding on to ideas of the true, the beautiful, and the good despite the atrocities, hanging on to a culture that had itself been lost in rubble or killed off in the concentration camps</span>
				<span class='text'>All the enthusiasm Adorno's students showed for intellectual matters could not erase the suspicion that, in the words of [[Max Frisch]], culture had become an &quot;alibi&quot; for the absence of political consciousness</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=332}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the foundations for what would come to be known as &quot;The Frankfurt School&quot; were soon laid: Horkheimer resumed his chair in social philosophy and the Institute for Social Research, rebuilt, became a lightning rod for critical thought</span>
				<span class='text'>===Essays on Fascism====Starting with his 1947 essay ''Wagner, Nietzsche and Hitler'',&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, TW (1947) ''Wagner, Nietzsche and Hitler'' in ''Kenyan Review'' Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>x (1)&lt;/ref&gt; Adorno produced a series of influential works to describe psychological fascist traits</span>
				<span class='text'>One of these works was ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'' (1950),&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, [http://ada</span>
				<span class='text'>vergreen</span>
				<span class='text'>du/~arunc/texts/frankfurt/ap/politics</span>
				<span class='text'>df ''Politics and Economics in the Interview Material''], ch</span>
				<span class='text'>7&lt;/ref&gt; published as a contribution to the ''Studies in Prejudice'' performed by multiple research institutes in the US, and consisting of a '[[qualitative research|qualitative interpretation]]s' that uncovered the [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] character of test persons through indirect questions</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=April 2010}} The books have had a major influence on sociology and remain highly discussed and debated</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1951 he continued on the topic with his essay ''Freudian Theory and the Pattern of Fascist Propaganda'', in which he said that &quot;Psychological dispositions do not actually cause fascism; rather, fascism defines a psychological area which can be successfully exploited by the forces which promote it for entirely non-psychological reasons of self-interest</span>

				<span class='text'>6–7&lt;/ref&gt;In 1952 Adorno participated in a group experiment, revealing residual National Socialist attitudes among the recently democratized Germans</span>
				<span class='text'>He then published two influential essays, ''The Meaning of Working Through the Past'' (1959), and ''Education after Auschwitz'' (1966), in which he argued on the survival of the uneradicated [[National Socialism]] in the [[mind-set]]s and institutions of the post-1945 Germany, and that there is still a real risk that it could raise again</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hammer (2006) p</span>
				<span class='text'>9&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, however, Jean Améry—who had been tortured at Auschwitz—would sharply object that Adorno, rather than addressing such political concerns, was exploiting Auschwitz for his metaphysical phantom &quot;absolute negativity&quot; (&quot;absolute Negativität&quot;), using a language intoxicated by itself (&quot;von sich selber bis zur Selbstblendung entzückte Sprache&quot;)</span>

				<span class='text'>129 (7 June 2004), p</span>
				<span class='text'>14</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;====Public events====In September 1951 Adorno returned to the United States for a six-week visit, during which he attended the opening of the Hacker Psychiatry Foundation in Beverly Hills, met [[Leo Lowenthal]] and [[Herbert Marcuse]] in New York and saw his mother for the last time</span>
				<span class='text'>After stopping in Paris, where he met [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]], [[Michel Leiris]] and [[René Leibowitz]], Adorno delivered a lecture entitled &quot;The Present State of Empirical Social Research in Germany&quot; at a conference on opinion research</span>
				<span class='text'>Here he emphasized the importance of data collection and statistical evaluation while asserting that such empirical methods have only an auxiliary function and must lead to the formation of theories which would &quot;raise the harsh facts to the level of consciousness</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=338}}&lt;/ref&gt;With Horkheimer as dean of the Arts Faculty, then rector of the university, responsibilities for the Institute's work fell upon Adorno</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time, however, Adorno renewed his musical work: with talks at the Kranichsteiner Musikgesellschaft, another in connection with a production of [[Ernst Krenek]]'s opera ''[[Leben des Orest]]'', and a seminar on &quot;Criteria of New Music&quot; at the Fifth International Summer Course for New Music at Kranichstein</span>
				<span class='text'>Adorno also became increasingly involved with the publishing house of [[Peter Suhrkamp]], inducing the latter to publish Benjamin's ''Berlin Childhood Around 1900'', Kracauer's writings and a two-volume edition of Benjamin's writings</span>
				<span class='text'>Adorno's own recently published ''Minima Moralia'' was not only well received in the press, but also met with great admiration from Thomas Mann, who wrote to Adorno from America in 1952:{{quote|I have spent days attached to your book as if by a magnet</span>
				<span class='text'>Every day brings new fascination </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>concentrated nourishment</span>
				<span class='text'>It is said that the companion star to Sirius, white in colour, is made of such dense material that a cubic inch of it would weigh a tonne here</span>
				<span class='text'>This is why it has such an extremely powerful gravitational field; in this respect it is similar to your book</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=343}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}Yet Adorno was no less moved by other public events: protesting the publication of [[Heinrich Mann]]'s novel ''[[Professor Unrat]]'' with its film title, ''[[The Blue Angel]]''; declaring his sympathy with those who protested the scandal of big-game hunting and penning a defense of prostitutes</span>
				<span class='text'>===More essays on mass culture and literature====Because Adorno's American citizenship would have been forfeited by the middle of 1952 had he continued to stay outside the country, he returned once again to [[Santa Monica]] to survey his prospects at the Hacker Foundation</span>
				<span class='text'>While there he wrote a content analysis of [[Western astrology|newspaper horoscopes]] (now collected in ''The Stars Down to Earth''), the essays &quot;Television as Ideology&quot; and &quot;Prologue to Television&quot;; even so, he was pleased when, at the end of ten months, he was enjoined to return as co-director of the Institute</span>
				<span class='text'>ack in Frankfurt, he renewed his academic duties and, from 1952 to 1954, completed the essays &quot;Notes on Kafka&quot;, &quot;Valéry Proust Museum&quot; and an essay on Schoenberg following the composer's death, all of which were included in the 1955 essay collection ''Prisms''</span>
				<span class='text'>In response to the publication of [[Thomas Mann]]'s ''[[The Black Swan (Mann novella)|The Black Swan]]'', Adorno penned a long letter to the author, who then approved its publication in the literary journal ''Akzente''</span>
				<span class='text'>A second collection of essays, ''Notes to Literature'', appeared in 1958</span>
				<span class='text'>After meeting [[Samuel Beckett]] while delivering a series of lectures in Paris the same year, Adorno set to work on &quot;Trying to Understand Endgame,&quot; which, along with studies of [[Proust]], [[Valéry]] and [[Balzac]], formed the central texts of the 1961 publication of the second volume of his ''Notes to Literature''</span>
				<span class='text'>Adorno's entrance into literary discussions continued in his June 1963 lecture at the annual conference of the Hölderlin Society</span>
				<span class='text'>At the Philosophers' Conference of October 1962 in Münster, at which Habermas wrote that Adorno was &quot;A writer among bureaucrats&quot;, Adorno presented &quot;Progress</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=362}}&lt;/ref&gt;Although the ''Zeitschrift'' was never revived, the Institute nevertheless published a series of important sociological books, including a collection of essays entitled ''Sociologica'' (1955), the ''Gruppenexperiment'' (1955), a study of work satisfaction among workers in Mannesmann called ''Betriebsklima'' and the ''Soziologische Exkurse'', a textbook-like anthology intended as an introductory work about the discipline</span>
				<span class='text'>===Public figure====Throughout the fifties and sixties, Adorno became a [[public figure]], not simply through his books and essays, but also through his appearances in radio and newspapers</span>
				<span class='text'>In talks, interviews and round-table discussions broadcast on Hessen Radio, South-West Radio and Radio Bremen, Adorno discussed topics as diverse as &quot;The Administered World&quot; (September 1950), &quot;What is the Meaning of 'Working Through the Past?&quot;' (February 1960) to &quot;The Teaching Profession and its Taboos&quot; (August 1965)</span>
				<span class='text'>Additionally, he frequently wrote for ''Frankfurter Allgemeine'', ''Frankfurter Rundschau'' and the weekly ''Die Zeit''</span>
				<span class='text'>t the invitation of Wolfgang Steinecke, Adorno took part in the Darmstadt Summer Courses for New Music in Kranichstein from 1951 to 1958</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet conflicts between the so-called [[Darmstadt school]], which included composers like [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], [[Luigi Nono]], [[Bruno Maderna]], [[Karel Goeyvaerts]], [[Luciano Berio]] and [[Gottfried Michael Koenig]], soon arose, receiving explicit expression in Adorno's 1954 lecture, &quot;The Aging of the New Music&quot;, where he argued that atonality's freedom was being restricted to serialism in much the same way as it was once restricted by twelve-tone technique</span>
				<span class='text'>With his friend [[Eduard Steuermann]], Adorno feared that music was being sacrificed to stubborn rationalization</span>
				<span class='text'>During this time Adorno not only produced a significant series of notes on Beethoven (which was never completed and only published posthumously), but also published ''Mahler: A Musical Physiognomy'' in 1960</span>
				<span class='text'>In his 1961 return to Kranichstein, Adorno called for what he termed a &quot;musique informelle&quot;, which would possess the ability &quot;really and truly to be what it is, without the ideological pretense of being something else</span>
				<span class='text'>Or rather, to admit frankly the fact of non-identity and to follow through its logic to the end</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=397}}&lt;/ref&gt;====Post-war German culture====At the same time Adorno struck up relationships with contemporary German-language poets such as [[Paul Celan]] and [[Ingeborg Bachmann]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Adorno's 1949 dictum—&quot;To write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric&quot;—posed the question of what German culture could mean after Auschwitz; his own continual revision of this dictum—in ''Negative Dialectics'', for example, he wrote that &quot;Perennial suffering has as much right to expression as a tortured man has to scream&quot;;  while in &quot;Commitment,&quot; he wrote in 1962 that the dictum &quot;expresses in negative form the impulse which inspires committed literature&quot;—was part of post-war Germany's struggle with history and culture</span>
				<span class='text'>Adorno additionally befriended the writer and poet [[Hans Magnus Enzensberger]] as well as the film-maker [[Alexander Kluge]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1963, Adorno was elected to the post of chairman of the German Sociological Society, where he presided over two important conferences: in 1964, on &quot;Max Weber and Sociology&quot; and in 1968 on &quot;Late Capitalism or Industrial Society&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>A debate launched in 1961 by Adorno and [[Karl Popper]], later published as the ''[[Positivist Dispute in German Sociology]]'', arose out of disagreements at the 1959 14th German Sociology Conference in Berlin</span>
				<span class='text'>dorno's critique of the dominant climate of post-war Germany was also directed against the pathos that had grown up around Heideggerianism, as practiced by writers like [[Karl Jaspers]] and [[Otto Friedrich Bollnow]], and which had subsequently seeped into public discourse</span>
				<span class='text'>His 1964 publication of ''The Jargon of Authenticity'' took aim at the halo such writers had attached to words like &quot;angst&quot;, &quot;decision&quot; and &quot;leap&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>After seven years of work, Adorno completed ''[[Negative Dialectics]]'' in 1966, after which, during the summer semester of 1967 and the winter semester of 1967-8, he offered regular philosophy seminars to discuss the book chapter by chapter</span>
				<span class='text'>Among the students at these seminars were the Americans [[Angela Davis]] and Irving Wohlfarth</span>
				<span class='text'>One objection which would soon take on ever greater importance, was that critical thought must adopt the standpoint of the oppressed, to which Adorno replied that negative dialectics was concerned &quot;with the dissolution of standpoint thinking itself</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;====Confrontations with students====At the time of ''Negative Dialectics''' publication, the fragility of West German democracy led to the increasing [[student protest]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>Monopolistic trends in the media, an educational crisis in the universities, the Shah of Persia's 1967 state visit, German support for the war in Vietnam and the emergency laws combined to create a highly unstable situation</span>
				<span class='text'>Like many of his students, Adorno too opposed the emergency laws, as well as the war in Vietnam, which, he said, proved the continued existence of the &quot;world of torture that had begun in Auschwitz&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=451}}&lt;/ref&gt; The situation only deteriorated with the police shooting of [[Benno Ohnesorg]] at a protest against the Shah's visit</span>
				<span class='text'>This death, as well as the subsequent acquittal of the responsible officer, were both commented upon in Adorno's lectures</span>
				<span class='text'>As politicization increased, rifts developed within both the Institute's relationship with its students as well as within the Institute itself</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon Adorno himself would become an object of the students' ire</span>
				<span class='text'>At the invitation of [[Peter Szondi]], Adorno was invited to the [[Free University of Berlin]] to give a lecture on [[Goethe]]'s ''Iphigenie in Tauris''</span>
				<span class='text'>After a group of students marched to the lectern, unfurling a banner that read &quot;Berlin's left-wing fascists greet Teddy the Classicist,&quot; a number of those present left the lecture in protest after Adorno refused to abandon his talk in favor of discussing his attitude on the current political situation</span>
				<span class='text'>Adorno shortly thereafter participated in a meeting with the Berlin Sozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund (SDS) and discussed &quot;Student Unrest&quot; with Szondi on West German Radio</span>
				<span class='text'>But as 1968 progressed, Adorno became increasingly critical of the students' disruptions to university life</span>
				<span class='text'>His isolation was only compounded by articles published in the magazine ''alternative'', which, following the lead of [[Hannah Arendt]]'s articles in ''Merkur'', claimed Adorno had subjected Benjamin to pressure during his years of exile in Berlin and compiled Benjamin's ''Writings'' and ''Letters'' with a great deal of bias</span>
				<span class='text'>In response, Benjamin's longtime friend [[Gershom Scholem]], wrote to the editor of ''Merkur'' to express his disapproval of the &quot;in part, shameful, not to say disgraceful&quot; remarks by Arendt</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=458}}&lt;/ref&gt;Relations between students and the West German state continued deteriorating</span>
				<span class='text'>In spring 1968, a prominent SDS spokesman, [[Rudi Dutschke]], was gunned down in the streets; in response, massive demonstrations took place, directed in particular against the [[Springer Press]], which had led a campaign to vilify the students</span>
				<span class='text'>An open appeal published in ''Die Zeit'', signed by Adorno, called for an inquiry into the social reasons that gave rise to this assassination attempt as well as an investigation into the Springer Press' manipulation of public opinion</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time, however, Adorno protested against disruptions of his own lectures and refused to express his solidarity with their political goals, maintaining instead his autonomy as a theoretician</span>
				<span class='text'>Adorno rejected the so-called unity of theory and praxis advocated by the students and argued that the students' actions were premised upon a mistaken analysis of the situation</span>
				<span class='text'>The building of barricades, he wrote to Marcuse, is &quot;ridiculous against those who administer the bomb</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=463}}&lt;/ref&gt;In September 1968 Adorno went to Vienna for the publication of ''Alban Berg: Master of the Smallest Link''</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon his return to Frankfurt, events prevented his concentrating upon the book on aesthetics he wished to write: &quot;Valid student claims and dubious actions,&quot; he wrote to Marcuse, &quot;are all so mixed up together that all productive work and even sensible thought are scarcely possible any more</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=464}}&lt;/ref&gt; After striking students threatened to strip the Institute's sociology seminar rooms of their furnishings and equipment, the police were brought in to close the building</span>
				<span class='text'>dorno began writing an introduction to a collection of poetry by Rudolf Borchardt, which was connected with a talk entitled &quot;Charmed Language,&quot; delivered in Zurich, followed by a talk on aesthetics in Paris where he met Beckett again</span>
				<span class='text'>Beginning in October 1966, Adorno took up work on ''Aesthetic Theory''</span>
				<span class='text'> In June 1969 he completed ''Catchwords: Critical Models''</span>
				<span class='text'>During the winter semester of 1968-9 Adorno was on sabbatical leave from the university and thus able to dedicate himself to the completion of his book of aesthetics</span>
				<span class='text'>or the summer semester Adorno planned a lecture course entitled &quot;An Introduction to Dialectical Thinking,&quot; as well as a seminar on the dialectics of subject and object</span>
				<span class='text'>But at the first lecture Adorno's attempt to open up the lecture and invite questions whenever they arose degenerated into a disruption from which he quickly fled: after a student wrote on the blackboard &quot;If Adorno is left in peace, capitalism will never cease,&quot; three women students approached the lectern, bared their breasts and scattered flower petals over his head</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=475}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Adorno continued to resist blanket condemnations of the protest movement which would have only strengthened the reactionary thesis according to which political irrationalism was the result of Adorno's teaching</span>
				<span class='text'>After further disruptions to his lectures, Adorno canceled the lectures for the rest of the seminar, continuing only with his philosophy seminar</span>
				<span class='text'>In the summer of 1969, weary from these activities, Adorno returned once again to [[Zermatt, Switzerland]], at the foot of Matterhorn to restore his strength</span>
				<span class='text'>On August 6 he died of a heart attack</span>
				<span class='text'>=Theory=={{Frankfurt School}}Adorno's work sets out from a central insight he shares with all early 20th century avant-garde art: the recognition of what is primitive in ourselves and the world itself</span>
				<span class='text'>Neither [[Picasso]]'s fascination with African sculpture nor [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]]'s reduction of painting to its most elementary component—the line—is comprehensible outside this concern with [[primitivism]] Adorno shared with the century's most radical art</span>
				<span class='text'>At that time, the Western world, beset by world-wars, colonialist consolidation and accelerating commodification, sank into the very barbarism civilization had prided itself in overcoming</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Adorno, society's self-preservation had become indistinguishable from societally sanctioned self-sacrifice: of &quot;primitive&quot; peoples, primitive aspects of the ego and those primitive, mimetic desires found in imitation and sympathy</span>
				<span class='text'>Adorno's theory proceeds from an understanding of this primitive quality of reality which seeks to counteract whatever aims either to repress this primitive aspect or to further those systems of domination set in place by this return to barbarism</span>
				<span class='text'>From this perspective, Adorno's writings on politics, philosophy, music and literature are a lifelong critique of the ways in which each tries to justify self-mutilation as the necessary price of self-preservation</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Adorno's translator Robert Hullot-Kentor, the central motive of Adorno's work thus consists in determining &quot;how life could be more than the struggle for self-preservation&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Durão|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, the principle of self-preservation, Adorno writes in ''Negative Dialectics'', is nothing but &quot;the law of doom thus far obeyed by history</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Adorno|2003|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its most basic, Adorno's thought is motivated by a fundamental critique of this law</span>
				<span class='text'>dorno was chiefly influenced by [[Max Weber]]'s critique of [[disenchantment]], [[Georg Lukács]]'s Hegelian interpretation of Marxism, as well as [[Walter Benjamin]]'s philosophy of history</span>
				<span class='text'>Adorno, along with the other major Frankfurt School theorists [[Max Horkheimer]] and [[Herbert Marcuse]], argued that advanced capitalism had managed to contain or liquidate the forces that would bring about its collapse and that the revolutionary moment, when it would have been possible to transform it into socialism, had passed</span>
				<span class='text'>As he put it at the beginning of his ''[[Negative Dialectics]]'' (1966), philosophy is still necessary because the time to realise it was missed</span>
				<span class='text'>Adorno argued that capitalism had become more entrenched through its attack on the objective basis of revolutionary consciousness and through liquidation of the individualism that had been the basis of critical consciousness</span>
				<span class='text'>==Music===In his early essays for the Vienna-based journal ''Anbruch'', Adorno claimed that musical progress is proportional to the composer's ability to constructively deal with the possibilities and limitations contained within what Adorno called the &quot;musical material</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; For Adorno, twelve-tone serialism constitutes a decisive, historically developed method of composition</span>
				<span class='text'>The objective validity of composition, according to Adorno, rests with neither the composer's genius nor the work's conformity with prior standards, but with the way in which the work coherently expresses the dialectic of the material</span>
				<span class='text'>In this sense, the contemporary absence of composers of the status of Bach or Beethoven is not the sign of musical regression; instead, new music is to be credited with laying bare aspects of the musical material previously repressed: The musical material's liberation from number, the harmonic series and tonal harmony</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, historical progress is achieved only by the composer who &quot;submits to the work and seemingly does not undertake anything active except to follow where it leads</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Because historical experience and social relations are embedded within this musical material, it is to the analysis of such material that the critic must turn</span>
				<span class='text'>In the face of this radical liberation of the musical material, Adorno came to criticize those who, like Stravinsky, withdrew from this freedom by taking recourse to forms of the past as well as those who turned twelve-tone composition into a technique which dictated the rules of composition</span>
				<span class='text'>dorno saw the culture industry as an arena in which critical tendencies or potentialities were eliminated</span>
				<span class='text'>He argued that the culture industry, which produced and circulated cultural commodities through the mass media, manipulated the population</span>
				<span class='text'>Popular culture was identified as a reason why people become passive; the easy pleasures available through consumption of popular culture made people docile and content, no matter how terrible their economic circumstances</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Capitalist production so confines them, body and soul, that they fall helpless victims to what is offered them</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Laughey|2007|loc=123}} The differences among cultural goods make them appear different, but they are in fact just variations on the same theme</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote that &quot;the same thing is offered to everybody by the standardized production of consumption goods&quot; but this is concealed under &quot;the manipulation of taste and the official culture's pretense of individualism&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Arato|1982|page=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; By doing so, the culture industry appeals to every single consumer in a unique and personalized way, all while maintaining minimal costs and effort on their behalf</span>
				<span class='text'>Consumers purchase the illusion that every commodity or product is tailored to the individual's personal preference, by incorporating subtle modifications or inexpensive &quot;add-ons&quot; in order to keep the consumer returning for new purchases, and therefore more revenue for the corporation system</span>
				<span class='text'>Adorno conceptualized this phenomenon as ''pseudo-individualization'' and the ''always-the-same''</span>
				<span class='text'>{{citation needed|date=April 2010}}Adorno's analysis allowed for a critique of mass culture from the left which balanced the critique of popular culture from the right</span>
				<span class='text'>From both perspectives—left and right—the nature of cultural production was felt to be at the root of social and moral problems resulting from the consumption of culture</span>
				<span class='text'>However, while the critique from the right emphasized moral degeneracy ascribed to sexual and racial influences within popular culture, Adorno located the problem not with the content, but with the objective realities of the production of mass culture and its effects, e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>as a form of [[reverse psychology]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} Thinkers influenced by Adorno believe that today's society has evolved in a direction foreseen by him, especially in regard to the past ([[Auschwitz]]), morals, or the Culture Industry</span>
				<span class='text'>The latter has become a particularly productive, yet highly contested term in [[cultural studies]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of Adorno's reflections on aesthetics and music have only just begun to be debated, as a collection of essays on the subject, many of which had not previously been translated into English, has only recently been collected and published as ''Essays on Music''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Adorno|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;Adorno's work in the years before his death was shaped by the idea of &quot;negative dialectics&quot;, set out especially in his book of that title</span>
				<span class='text'>A key notion in the work of the Frankfurt School since ''Dialectic of Enlightenment'' had been the idea of thought becoming an instrument of domination that subsumes all objects under the control of the (dominant) subject, especially through the notion of identity, i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>of identifying as real in nature and society only that which harmonized or fit with dominant concepts, and regarding as unreal or non-existent everything that did not</span>
				<span class='text'>{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} Adorno's &quot;negative dialectics&quot; was an attempt to articulate a non-dominating thought that would recognize its limitations and accept the non-identity and reality of that which could not be subsumed under the subject's concepts</span>
				<span class='text'>Indeed, Adorno sought to ground the critical bite of his sociological work in his critique of identity, which he took to be a reification in thought of the commodity form or exchange relation which always presumes a false identity between different things</span>
				<span class='text'>The potential to criticise arises from the gap between the concept and the object, which can never go into the former without remainder</span>
				<span class='text'>This gap, this non-identity in identity, was the secret to a critique of both material life and conceptual reflection</span>
				<span class='text'>{{citation needed|date=April 2010}}Adorno's reputation as a musicologist has been in steady decline since his death</span>
				<span class='text'> His sweeping criticisms of jazz and championing of the second Viennese school in opposition to Stravinsky have caused him to fall out of favour</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; declares Adorno to be 'preposterously over-rated</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The British philosopher [[Roger Scruton]] saw Adorno as producing 'reams of turgid nonsense devoted to showing that the American people are just as alienated as Marxism requires them to be, and that their cheerful life-affirming music is a ‘fetishized’ commodity, expressive of their deep spiritual enslavement to the capitalist machine</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==== The Five Components of Recognition ====Adorno states that a start to understand the recognition in respect of any particular song hit may be made by drafting a scheme which divides the experience of recognitio into its different components</span>
				<span class='text'>All the factors people enumerate are interwoven to a degree that would be impossible to separate from one another in reality</span>
				<span class='text'>Adorno's scheme is directed towards the different objective elements involved in the experience of recogniton, than the actual experience felt for the individual</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Laughey|2007|loc=204}} It would suggest that in today's modern society (edited in 2012), according to Adorno we inhabit a media culture driven society in which one of its main characteristics is product consumption</span>
				<span class='text'>Mass media is employed to vehicle message about products and services to consumers in order to convince these individuals to purchase the commodity they are advertising</span>
				<span class='text'>Standardization consists of the production of large amounts of commodities to then pursue consumers in order to gain the maximum profit possible</span>
				<span class='text'>hey do this, as mentioned above, by individualising products to give the illusion to consumers that they are in fact purchasing a product or service that was specifically designed for them</span>
				<span class='text'>Adorno highlights the issues created with the construction of popular music, where different samples of music used in the creation of today's chart-topping songs are put together in order to create, re-create, and modify numerous tracks by using the same variety of samples from one song to another</span>
				<span class='text'>He makes a distinction between &quot;Apologetic music&quot; and &quot;Critical music&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Apologetic music is defined as the highly produced and promoted music of the &quot;pop music&quot; industry: music that is composed of variable parts and interchanged to create several different songs</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;The social and psychological functions of popular music [are that it] acts like a social cement&quot;{{sfn|Adorno|1990|loc={{Page needed|date=April 2015}}}} &quot;to keep people obedient and subservient to the status quo of existing power structures</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Laughey|2007|loc=125}}Serious music, according to Adorno, achieves excellence when its whole is greater than the sum of its parts</span>
				<span class='text'>The example he gives is that of Beethoven's symphonies: &quot;[his] greatness shows itself in the complete subordination of the accidentally private melodic elements to the form as a whole&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Laughey|2010|loc=125}}Standardization not only refers to the products of the culture industry but to the consumers as well: many times every day consumers are bombarded by media advertising</span>
				<span class='text'>Consumers are pushed and shoved into consuming products and services presented to them by the media system</span>
				<span class='text'>The masses have become conditioned by the culture industry, which makes the impact of standardization much more important</span>
				<span class='text'>By not realizing the impact of social media and commercial advertising, the individual is caught in a situation where conformity is the norm</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;During consumption the masses become characterized by the commodities which they use and exchange among themselves</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Laughey|2007|loc=124}}===Adorno's responses to his critics===As a pioneer of a self-reflexive sociology who prefigured [[Bourdieu]]'s ability to factor in the effect of reflection on the societal object, Adorno realized that some criticism (including deliberate disruption of his classes in the 1960s) could never be answered in a dialogue between equals if, as he seems to have believed, what the naive ethnographer or sociologist thinks of a human essence is always changing over time</span>

				<span class='text'>[[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s book ''The Weight of the World'')</span>
				<span class='text'>He felt that those at the top of the Institute needed to be the source primarily of theories for evaluation and empirical testing, as well as people who would process the &quot;facts&quot; discovered</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>ncluding revising theories that were found to be false</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, in an essay published in Germany on Adorno's return from the USA, and reprinted in the ''Critical Models'' essays collection (ISBN 0-231-07635-5), Adorno praised the [[egalitarianism]] and openness of US society  based on his sojourn in New York and the Los Angeles area between 1935 and 1955: &quot;Characteristic for the life in America [</span>
				<span class='text'></span>

				<span class='text'>45&lt;/ref&gt;One example of the clash of intellectual culture and Adorno's methods can be found in [[Paul Lazarsfeld]], the American sociologist for whom Adorno worked in the late 1930s after fleeing Hitler</span>
				<span class='text'>As Rolf Wiggershaus recounts in ''The Frankfurt School, Its History, Theories and Political Significance'' (MIT 1995), Lazarsfeld was the director of a project, funded and inspired by David Sarnoff (the head of [[RCA]]), to discover both the sort of music that listeners of radio liked and ways to improve their &quot;taste&quot;, so that RCA could profitably air more classical music</span>
				<span class='text'>Lazarsfeld, however, had trouble both with the prose style of the work Adorno handed in and what Lazarsfeld thought was Adorno's &quot;lack of discipline in </span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wiggershaus|1995|page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;Adorno himself provided the following personal anecdote:{{Quotation|What I mean by reified consciousness, I can illustrate—without elaborate philosophical contemplation—most simply with an American experience</span>
				<span class='text'>Among the frequently changing colleagues which the Princeton Project provided me with, was a young lady</span>

				<span class='text'>I said, &quot;It depends on the question, but just go ahead&quot;, and she went on: &quot;Please tell me: are you an extrovert or an introvert?&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>A similar difficulty of translation is true of [[Hegel]], [[Heidegger]], and a number of other German philosophers and poets</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, some early translators tended toward over-literalness</span>
				<span class='text'>In recent years, [[Edmund Jephcott]] and [[Stanford University Press]] have published new translations of some of Adorno's lectures and books, including ''Introduction to Sociology'', ''Problems of Moral Philosophy'' and his transcribed lectures on Kant's ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' and Aristotle's &quot;Metaphysics&quot;, and a new translation of the ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Professor Henry Pickford, of the University of Colorado at Boulder, has translated many of Adorno's works such as &quot;The Meaning of Working Through the Past</span>

				<span class='text'>Hullot-Kentor is also currently working on a new translation of ''Negative Dialectics''</span>
