				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Rossini as a young man]]Gioachino Antonio Rossini was born into a family of musicians in [[Pesaro]], a town on the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast of Italy which was then part of the [[Papal States]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His father, Giuseppe, was a horn player and inspector of slaughterhouses</span>
				<span class='text'>His mother, Anna, was a [[singing|singer]] and a baker's daughter</span>
				<span class='text'>Rossini's parents began his musical training early, and by the age of six he was playing the triangle in his father's musical group</span>
				<span class='text'>ossini's father was sympathetic to the [[French Revolution]] and welcomed [[Napoleon]]'s troops when they arrived in northern Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>When [[Austria]] restored the old regime, Rossini's father was sent to prison in 1799, where he remained until June 1800</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Osborne 2007, p</span>
				<span class='text'>5&lt;/ref&gt; Rossini's mother took him to [[Bologna]], making a living as leading singer at various theatres of the [[Romagna]] region</span>
				<span class='text'>Her husband would ultimately join her in Bologna</span>
				<span class='text'>During this time, Rossini was frequently left in the care of his aging grandmother, who had difficulty supervising the boy</span>
				<span class='text'>e remained at Bologna in the care of a pork butcher while his father played the horn in the orchestras of the theatres at which his wife sang</span>
				<span class='text'>The boy had three years of instruction in the playing of the [[harpsichord]] from Giuseppe Prinetti, originally from [[Novara]], who played the scale with two fingers only; Prinetti also owned a business selling beer and had a propensity to fall asleep while standing</span>
				<span class='text'>These qualities made him a subject for ridicule in the eyes of the young Rossini</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Osborne 2007, p</span>
				<span class='text'>7&lt;/ref&gt;==Education==He was eventually taken from Prinetti and apprenticed to a blacksmith</span>
				<span class='text'>In Angelo Tesei, he found a congenial music master, and learned to sight-read, play accompaniments on the [[piano]] and sing well enough to take solo parts in the church when he was ten years of age</span>
				<span class='text'>Important products of this period are six ''sonate a quattro'', or string sonatas, composed in three days, unusually scored for two violins, cello and double bass</span>
				<span class='text'>The original scores, dating from 1804, when the composer was twelve, were found in the [[Library of Congress]] in Washington D</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Often transcribed for string orchestra, these sonatas reveal the young composer's affinity for [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], already showing signs of operatic tendencies, punctuated by frequent rhythmic changes and dominated by clear, songlike melodies</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1805, he appeared at the theatre of the Commune in [[Ferdinando Paer]]'s ''Camilla'', his only public appearance as a singer</span>
				<span class='text'>He was also a capable horn player, treading in the footsteps of his father</span>
				<span class='text'>Around this time, he composed individual numbers to a [[libretto]] by Vincenza Mombelli called ''[[Demetrio e Polibio]]'', which was handed to the boy in pieces</span>
				<span class='text'>Though it was Rossini's first opera, written when he was thirteen or fourteen, the work was not staged until the composer was twenty years old, premiering as his sixth official opera</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1806, Rossini became a [[cello]] student under Cavedagni at the Conservatorio di Bologna</span>
				<span class='text'>The following year he was admitted to the counterpoint class of Padre [[Stanislao Mattei]] (1750–1825)</span>
				<span class='text'>He learned to play the cello with ease, but the pedantic severity of Mattei's views on counterpoint served only to drive the young composer's views toward a freer school of composition</span>
				<span class='text'>His insight into orchestral resources is generally ascribed not to the strict compositional rules that he learned from Mattei, but to knowledge gained independently while scoring the quartets and symphonies of Haydn and Mozart</span>
				<span class='text'>At Bologna, he was known as &quot;il Tedeschino&quot; (&quot;the Little German&quot;) on account of his devotion to Mozart</span>
				<span class='text'>=Career as a composer=====Early years: ''Demetrio e Polibio'' (1812) to ''Torvaldo e Dorliska'' (1815)===Through the friendly interposition of the Marquis Cavalli, his first opera, ''[[La cambiale di matrimonio]]'' (''The Marriage Contract''), was produced at Venice when he was a youth of 18 years</span>
				<span class='text'>Two years before this he had already received the prize at the Conservatorio of Bologna for his cantata ''Il pianto d'Armonia sulla morte d'Orfeo''</span>
				<span class='text'>Between 1810 and 1813 at Bologna, Rome, Venice and Milan, Rossini produced operas of varying success, most notably ''[[La pietra del paragone]]'' and ''[[Il signor Bruschino]]'', with its brilliant and unique overture</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1813, ''[[Tancredi]]'' and ''[[L'italiana in Algeri]]'' were even bigger successes, and catapulted the 20-year-old composer to international fame</span>
				<span class='text'>he [[libretto]] for ''Tancredi'' was an arrangement by [[Gaetano Rossi]] of [[Voltaire]]'s tragedy ''Tancrède''</span>
				<span class='text'>Traces of [[Ferdinando Paer]] and [[Giovanni Paisiello]] were undeniably present in fragments of the music</span>
				<span class='text'>But any critical feeling on the part of the public was drowned by appreciation of such melodies as &quot;''Di tanti palpiti</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Mi rivedrai, ti rivedrò''&quot;, which became so popular that the Italians would sing it in crowds at the law courts until called upon by the judge to desist</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Rossini-portrait-0</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|Gioachino Rossini, c</span>
				<span class='text'>1815 (by [[Vincenzo Camuccini]])]]By the age of 21, Rossini had established himself as the idol of the Italian opera public</span>
				<span class='text'>He continued to write operas for Venice and Milan during the next few years, but their reception was tame and in some cases unsatisfactory after the success of ''Tancredi</span>
				<span class='text'>' In 1815 he retired to his home in Bologna, where [[Domenico Barbaia]], the impresario of the [[Naples]] theatre, contracted an agreement that made him musical director of the [[Teatro di San Carlo]] and the [[Teatro del Fondo]] at Naples</span>
				<span class='text'>He would compose one opera a year for each</span>
				<span class='text'>His payment was to be 200 ducats per month; he was also to receive a share from the gambling tables set in the theatre's &quot;ridotto&quot;, amounting to about 1000 ducats per annum</span>
				<span class='text'>This was an extraordinarily lucrative arrangement for any professional musician at that time</span>
				<span class='text'>e visited the Naples conservatory, and, although less than four years senior to [[Saverio Mercadante|Mercadante]], he said to the Director [[Niccolò Antonio Zingarelli|Niccolò Zingarelli]], &quot;My compliments Maestro – your young pupil Mercadante begins where we finish</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RCAFluteConcertos&quot;&gt;Michael Rose 2004, &quot;Mercadante: Flute Concertos&quot;, booklet accompanying the RCA CD recording with [[James Galway]] and [[I Solisti Veneti]] under [[Claudio Scimone]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Some older composers in Naples, notably Zingarelli and Paisiello, were inclined to intrigue against the success of the youthful composer, but all hostility was rendered futile by the enthusiasm that greeted the court performance of his ''[[Elisabetta, regina d'Inghilterra]]'', in which [[Isabella Colbran]], who subsequently became the composer's wife, took a leading part</span>
				<span class='text'>The libretto of this opera by [[Giovanni Schmidt]] was in many of its incidents an anticipation of those presented to the world a few years later in Sir [[Walter Scott]]'s ''[[Kenilworth (novel)|Kenilworth]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The opera was the first in which Rossini wrote out the ornaments of the arias instead of leaving them to the fancy of the singers, and also the first in which the [[Recitative#Secco|recitativo ''secco'']] was replaced by a recitative accompanied by a [[string quartet]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==The resounding success of ''The Barber of Seville'' (1816)===[[File:Isabella Colbran</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|Isabella Colbran]]{{Main|The Barber of Seville}}Rossini's most famous opera was produced on 20 February 1816, at the [[Teatro Argentina]] in Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>The libretto, a version of [[Pierre Beaumarchais]]' stage play ''[[The Barber of Seville (play)|Le Barbier de Séville]]'', was newly written by [[Cesare Sterbini]] and not the same as that already used by [[Giovanni Paisiello]] in his own ''Barbiere'', an opera which had enjoyed European popularity for more than a quarter of a century</span>
				<span class='text'>Much is made of how quickly Rossini's opera was written, scholarship generally agreeing upon two or three weeks</span>
				<span class='text'>Later in life, Rossini claimed to have written the opera in only twelve days</span>
				<span class='text'>It was a colossal failure when it premiered as ''Almaviva''; Paisiello's admirers were extremely indignant, sabotaging the production by whistling and shouting during the entire first act</span>
				<span class='text'>However, not long after the second performance, the opera became so successful that the fame of Paisiello's opera was transferred to Rossini's, to which the title ''The Barber of Seville'' passed as an inalienable heritage</span>
				<span class='text'>ater in 1822, a 30-year-old Rossini succeeded in meeting [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], who was then aged 51, deaf, cantankerous and in failing health</span>
				<span class='text'>Communicating in writing, Beethoven noted: &quot;Ah, Rossini</span>
				<span class='text'>So you're the composer of ''The Barber of Seville''</span>
				<span class='text'>I congratulate you</span>
				<span class='text'>It will be played as long as Italian opera exists</span>
				<span class='text'>Never try to write anything else but [[opera buffa]]; any other style would do violence to your nature</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fisher&quot;/&gt;===Middle years: ''La gazzetta'' (1816) to ''Semiramide'' (1823)===[[File:GiorcesRossini1</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|Gioachino Rossini in 1820, International Museum and Library of Music, Bologna]][[File:Rossini-by-Friedrich Lieder-1822</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Rossini, (Friedrich Lieder, 1822)]]Between 1815 and 1823 Rossini produced 20 operas</span>
				<span class='text'>Of these, ''[[Otello (Rossini)|Otello]]'' formed the climax to his reform of serious opera, and offers a suggestive contrast with the treatment of the same subject at a similar point of artistic development by the composer [[Giuseppe Verdi]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In Rossini's time, the tragic ending was so distasteful to the public of Rome that it was necessary to invent a happy conclusion to ''Otello''</span>
				<span class='text'>onditions of stage production in 1817 are illustrated by Rossini's acceptance of the subject of [[Cinderella]] for a libretto only on the condition that the supernatural element should be omitted</span>
				<span class='text'>The opera ''[[La Cenerentola]]'' was as successful as ''Barbiere''</span>
				<span class='text'>The absence of a similar precaution in construction of his ''[[Mosè in Egitto]]'' led to disaster in the scene depicting the passage of the Israelites through the [[Red Sea]], when the defects in stage contrivance always raised a laugh, so that the composer was at length compelled to introduce the chorus &quot;Dal tuo stellato soglio&quot; to divert attention from the dividing waves</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1822, four years after the production of this work, Rossini married the renowned opera singer [[Isabella Colbran]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In the same year, he moved from Italy to Vienna, where his operas were the rage of the audiences</span>
				<span class='text'>He directed his ''Cenerentola'' in [[Vienna]], where ''[[Zelmira]]'' was also performed</span>
				<span class='text'>After this he returned to Bologna, but an invitation from Metternich to the [[Congress of Verona]] to &quot;assist in the general re-establishment of harmony&quot; was too tempting to refuse, and he arrived at the Congress in time for its opening on 20 October 1822</span>
				<span class='text'>Here he made friends with [[François-René de Chateaubriand|Chateaubriand]] and [[Dorothea Lieven]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1823, at the suggestion of the manager of the [[Her Majesty's Theatre|King's Theatre]], London, he came to Britain, being much fêted on his way through Paris</span>
				<span class='text'>He was given a generous welcome, which included an introduction to King [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] and the receipt of £7000 (£{{Inflation|UK|7000|1823|r=-4}} today) after a residence of five months</span>
				<span class='text'>The next year, he became musical director of the [[Théâtre-Italien (1801–1878)|Théâtre des Italiens]] in Paris at a salary of £800 (£{{Inflation|UK|800|1824|r=-3}} today) per annum</span>
				<span class='text'>Rossini's popularity in Paris was so great that [[Charles X]] gave him a contract to write five new operas a year, and at the expiration of the contract, he was to receive a generous pension for life</span>
				<span class='text'>==Composing for Paris: ''Il viaggio a Reims'' (1825) to ''Guillaume Tell'' (1829)===During his Paris years, Rossini created the comic operas ''[[Le comte Ory]]'' and ''[[William Tell (opera)|Guillaume Tell]]'' (''William Tell'')</span>
				<span class='text'>The production of the latter in 1829 brought his career as a writer of opera to a close</span>
				<span class='text'>He was thirty-eight years old and had already composed thirty-eight operas</span>
				<span class='text'>''Guillaume Tell'' was a political epic adapted from [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]]'s play ''[[William Tell (play)|Wilhelm Tell]]'' (1804) about [[William Tell|the 13th-century Swiss patriot]] who rallied his country against the Austrians</span>
				<span class='text'>The libretto was by [[Victor-Joseph Étienne de Jouy|Étienne Jouy]] and {{ill|fr|Hippolyte Bis}}, but their version was revised by [[Armand Marrast]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Faul 2009, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>139–141&lt;/ref&gt;The music is remarkable for its freedom from the conventions discovered and utilized by Rossini in his earlier works, and marks a transitional stage in the history of opera, [[William Tell Overture|the overture]] serving as a model for romantic overtures throughout the 19th century</span>
				<span class='text'>Though an excellent opera, it is rarely heard uncut today, as the original score runs more than four hours in performance</span>
				<span class='text'>The overture is one of the most famous and frequently recorded works in the classical repertoire</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1829 he returned to Bologna</span>
				<span class='text'>His mother had died in 1827, and he was anxious to be with his father</span>
				<span class='text'>Arrangements for his subsequent return to Paris on a new agreement were temporarily upset by the abdication of [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] and the [[July Revolution]] of 1830</span>
				<span class='text'>Rossini, who had been considering the subject of [[Faust]] for a new opera, did return, however, to Paris in November of that year</span>
				<span class='text'>ix movements of his ''[[Stabat Mater (Rossini)|Stabat Mater]]'' were written in 1832 by Rossini himself and the other six by [[Giovanni Tadolini]], a good musician who was asked by Rossini to complete the work</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Rossini composed the rest of the score in 1841</span>
				<span class='text'>The success of the work bears comparison with his achievements in opera, but his comparative silence during the period from 1832 to his death in 1868 makes his biography appear almost like the narrative of two lives—the life of swift triumph and the long life of seclusion, of which biographers give us pictures in stories of the composer's cynical wit, his speculations in fish mongering,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books</span>

				<span class='text'>Political disturbances compelled Rossini to leave Bologna in 1848</span>
				<span class='text'>After living for a time in Florence, he settled in Paris in 1855, where he hosted many artistic and literary figures</span>
				<span class='text'>Rossini had been a well-known [[gourmand]] and an excellent amateur chef his entire life, but he indulged these two passions fully once he retired from composing, and today there are a number of dishes with the appendage &quot;alla Rossini&quot; to their names that were either created by or specifically for him</span>
				<span class='text'>Probably the most famous of these is [[tournedos Rossini]], still served by many restaurants today</span>
				<span class='text'>n the meantime, after years of various physical and mental illnesses, he had slowly returned to music, composing obscure little works intended for private performance</span>
				<span class='text'>These included his [[Péchés de vieillesse]] (&quot;Sins of Old Age&quot;), which are grouped into 14 volumes, mostly for solo piano, occasionally for voice and various chamber ensembles</span>
				<span class='text'>Often whimsical, these pieces display Rossini's natural ease of composition and gift for melody, showing obvious influences of Beethoven and [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]], with many flashes of the composer's long buried desire for serious, academic composition</span>
				<span class='text'>They also underpin the fact that Rossini himself was an outstanding pianist whose playing attracted high praise from people such as [[Franz Liszt]], [[Sigismond Thalberg]], [[Camille Saint-Saëns]] and [[Louis Diémer]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Osborne, 1986, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>63, 112, and 268&lt;/ref&gt;He died at the age of 76 from pneumonia at his country house at [[Passy]] on Friday, 13 November 1868</span>
				<span class='text'>He was buried in [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris, France</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1887, his remains were moved to the [[Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence]], at the request of the Italian government</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|150px|Gioachino Rossini ([[Francesco Hayez]], 1870; Pinacoteca di Brera, Milan)]]  According to the ''Oxford History of Western Music'', &quot;Rossini's fame surpassed that of any previous composer, and so, for a long time, did the popularity of his works</span>
				<span class='text'> Audiences took to his music as if to an intoxicating drug – or, to put it more decorously, to champagne, with which Rossini's bubbly music was constantly compared</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford History&quot;&gt;Tarushkin 2010, p</span>
				<span class='text'>?&lt;/ref&gt;Rossini took existing operatic genres and forms and perfected them in his own style</span>
				<span class='text'> Through his own work, as well as through that of his followers and imitators, Rossini's style dominated Italian opera throughout the first half of the 19th century</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford History&quot;/&gt;In his compositions, Rossini plagiarized freely from himself, a common practice among deadline-pressed opera composers of the time</span>
				<span class='text'>Few of his operas are without such admixtures, frankly introduced in the form of arias or overtures</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, in ''Il Barbiere'' there is an aria for the Count (often omitted) &quot;Cessa di più resistere&quot;, which Rossini used (with minor changes) in the [[cantata]] ''Le Nozze di Teti e di Peleo'' and in ''[[La Cenerentola]]'' (the cabaletta for Angelina's rondo is almost unchanged)</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, four of his best known overtures (''[[La cambiale di matrimonio]]'', ''[[Tancredi]]'', ''La Cenerentola'' and ''[[The Barber of Seville]]'') share operas apart from those with which they are most famously associated</span>
				<span class='text'> characteristic mannerism in Rossini's orchestral scoring is a long, steady building of sound over an [[ostinato]] figure, creating &quot;tempests in teapots by beginning in a whisper and rising to a flashing, glittering storm,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Faddis 2003, Program notes for a performance of the overture to ''[[La scala di seta]]'' by the Cape Anne Symphony, 2007; See also [http://www</span>

				<span class='text'> few of Rossini's operas remained popular throughout his lifetime and continuously since his death; others were resurrected from semi-obscurity in the last half of the 20th century, during the so-called &quot;Rossini Renaissance&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>ossini himself correctly predicted that his ''Barber of Seville'' would continue to find favor with posterity, telling a friend::One thing I believe I can assure you: that of my works, the second act of ''Guglielmo Tell'', the third act of ''Otello'', and all of ''il Barbiere di Siviglia'' will certainly endure</span>
