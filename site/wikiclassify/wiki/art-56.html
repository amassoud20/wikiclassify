				<span class='text'>he Umayyad army then moved to Bobastro while the cavalry was sent to the castle of Sant Batir which was abandoned by the defenders allowing Abd ar Rahmans troops to secure a large booty</span>
				<span class='text'>Then it was the turn of the castles of Olías and Reina</span>
				<span class='text'>The latter fell after a violent fight leaving the road open to the major city and provincial capital of Málaga which he captured after one day</span>
