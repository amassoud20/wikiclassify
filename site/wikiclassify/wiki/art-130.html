				<span class='text'>His defeat of [[Napoleon]] at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in 1815 put him in the top rank of Britain's military heroes</span>
				<span class='text'>In 2002, he was number 15 in the BBC's poll of the [[100 Greatest Britons]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ellesley was born in [[Dublin]], belonging to the [[Protestant Ascendancy]] in [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was commissioned as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] in the [[British Army]] in 1787, serving in Ireland as [[aide-de-camp]] to two successive [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lords Lieutenant of Ireland]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was also elected as a [[Member of Parliament]] in the [[Irish House of Commons]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a colonel by 1796, and saw action in the [[Flanders Campaign|Netherlands]] and in India, where he fought in the [[Fourth Anglo-Mysore War]] at the [[Siege of Seringapatam (1799)|Battle of Seringapatam]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was appointed governor of [[Seringapatam]] and [[Mysore]] in 1799 and, as a newly appointed major-general, won a decisive victory over the [[Maratha Empire#The Confederacy era (1761–1818)|Maratha Confederacy]] at the [[Battle of Assaye]] in 1803</span>
				<span class='text'>ellesley rose to prominence as a general during the [[Peninsular War|Peninsular campaign]] of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and was promoted to the rank of field marshal after leading the allied forces to victory against the French at the [[Battle of Vitoria]] in 1813</span>
				<span class='text'>Following [[Napoleon]]'s exile in 1814, he served as the [[List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to France|ambassador to France]] and was granted a dukedom</span>
				<span class='text'>During the [[Hundred Days]] in 1815, he commanded the [[Seventh Coalition|allied]] army which defeated Napoleon at Waterloo, together with a [[Prussian Army|Prussian army]] under [[Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher|Blücher]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Wellesley's [[Battle record of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|battle record]] is exemplary; he ultimately participated in some 60 battles during the course of his military career</span>
				<span class='text'>ellesley is famous for his adaptive defensive style of warfare,  resulting in several victories against a numerically superior force while minimising his own losses</span>
				<span class='text'>He is regarded as one of the greatest defensive commanders of all time, and many of his tactics and battle plans are still studied in military academies around the world</span>
				<span class='text'>fter ending his active military career, Wellesley returned to politics</span>
				<span class='text'>He was twice [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British prime minister]] as part of the [[Tories (political faction)|Tory]] party: from 1828 to 1830, and for a little less than a month in 1834</span>
				<span class='text'>He oversaw the passage of the [[Catholic Relief Act 1829]], but opposed the [[Reform Act 1832]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He continued as one of the leading figures in the [[House of Lords]] until his retirement and remained [[Commander-in-Chief of the Forces|Commander-in-Chief of the British Army]] until his death</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; His birthplace is uncertain</span>
				<span class='text'>He was most likely born at his parents' townhouse, 24 Upper [[Merrion Street]], Dublin, now the [[Merrion Hotel]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; His loneliness there caused him to hate it, and makes it highly unlikely that he actually said, &quot;The Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton,&quot; a quote which is often attributed to him</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, Eton had no playing fields at the time</span>
				<span class='text'> In 1785, a lack of success at Eton, combined with a shortage of family funds due to his father's death, forced the young Wellesley and his mother to move to [[Brussels]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes9&quot;/&gt; Until his early twenties, Arthur showed little sign of distinction and his mother grew increasingly concerned at his idleness, stating, &quot;I don't know what I shall do with my awkward son Arthur</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes21&quot;/&gt; He was also transferred to the new [[76th Regiment of Foot|76th Regiment]] forming in Ireland and on Christmas Day, 1787, was promoted to [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|lieutenant]]</span>

				<span class='text'>With communications and supply from Lisbon secured for now, Wellesley considered joining with Cuesta again but found out that his Spanish ally had abandoned the British wounded to the French and was thoroughly uncooperative, promising and then refusing to supply the British forces, aggravating Wellesley and causing considerable friction between the British and their Spanish allies</span>
				<span class='text'>The lack of supplies, coupled with the threat of French reinforcement (including the possible inclusion of Napoleon himself) in the spring, led to the British deciding to retreat into Portugal</span>

				<span class='text'>Notes: &quot;While, in view of the developing strategic situation, is not clear what Wellington hoped to gain by its seizure, he had resolved to take the fortress—a task which he evidently believed could be easily accomplished; for, notwithstanding the [[Battle of Badajoz (1812)|sanguinary lessons]] that virtually all his sieges had given him and the availability of scores of heavy cannon captured at Ciudad Rodrigo and Madrid, he brought up only eight heavy guns to breach the defences</span>
				<span class='text'>This force was to prove lamentably inadequate and, in this and other aspects of the operation, Wellington's complacency and ineptitude were to cost his troops dear</span>

				<span class='text'>He struck through the hills north of Burgos, the [[Trás-os-Montes (region)|Tras os Montes]], and switched his supply line from Portugal to [[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]] on Spain's north coast; this led to the French abandoning Madrid and Burgos</span>
				<span class='text'>Continuing to outflank the French lines, Wellington caught up with and smashed the army of King [[Joseph Bonaparte]] in the [[Battle of Vitoria]], for which he was promoted to [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|field marshal]] on 21 June</span>

				<span class='text'>The British troops broke ranks to loot the abandoned French wagons instead of pursuing the beaten foe</span>

				<span class='text'>]The Battle of Waterloo commenced with a diversionary attack on [[Hougoumont]] by a division of French soldiers</span>
				<span class='text'>After a barrage of 80 cannons the first French infantry attack was launched by [[Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon|Comte D'Erlon]]'s I Corps</span>
				<span class='text'>D'Erlon's troops advanced through the Allied centre, resulting in Allied troops in front of the ridge retreating in disorder through the main position</span>
				<span class='text'>D'Erlon's corps stormed the most fortified Allied position, [[La Haye Sainte]], but failed to take it</span>
				<span class='text'>An Allied division under [[Thomas Picton]] met the remainder of D'Erlon's corps head to head, engaging them in an infantry duel in which Picton fell</span>
				<span class='text'>During this struggle [[Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey|Lord Uxbridge]] launched two of his cavalry brigades at the enemy, catching the French infantry off guard, driving them to the bottom of the slope, and capturing two [[French Imperial Eagle]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>The charge, however, over-reached itself, and the British cavalry, crushed by fresh French horsemen hurled at them by Napoleon, were driven back, suffering tremendous losses</span>

				<span class='text'>He mistook the movement of casualties to the rear for the beginnings of a retreat, and sought to exploit it</span>
				<span class='text'>Ney at this time had few infantry reserves left, as most of the infantry had been committed either to the futile Hougoumont attack or to the defence of the French right</span>

				<span class='text'>Commanded by [[Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von Bülow|Freiherr von Bülow]], IV Corps arrived as the French cavalry attack was in full spate</span>
				<span class='text'>Bülow sent the 15th Brigade to link up with Wellington's left flank in the [[Frichermont]]–[[La Haie, Lasne|La Haie]] area while the brigade's horse artillery battery and additional brigade artillery deployed to its left in support</span>

				<span class='text'>The 15th Brigade sent Lobau's corps into retreat to the Plancenoit area</span>
				<span class='text'>Von Hiller's 16th Brigade also pushed forward with six battalions against Plancenoit</span>
				<span class='text'>Napoleon had dispatched all eight battalions of the Young Guard to reinforce Lobau, who was now seriously pressed by the enemy</span>
				<span class='text'>Napoleon's Young Guard counter-attacked and, after very hard fighting, secured Plancenoit, but were themselves counter-attacked and driven out</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Eventually it became obvious, even to Ney, that cavalry alone were achieving little</span>
				<span class='text'>Belatedly, he organised a combined-arms attack, using Bachelu's division and Tissot's regiment of Foy's division from Reille's II Corps plus those French cavalry that remained in a fit state to fight</span>
				<span class='text'>This assault was directed along much the same route as the previous heavy cavalry attacks</span>

				<span class='text'>]Meanwhile, at approximately the same time as Ney's combined-arms assault on the centre-right of Wellington's line, Napoleon ordered Ney to capture La Haye Sainte at whatever the cost</span>
				<span class='text'>Ney accomplished this with what was left of D'Erlon's corps soon after 18:00</span>
				<span class='text'>Ney then moved [[horse artillery]] up towards Wellington's centre and began to destroy the infantry squares at short-range with [[canister shot|canister]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Siborne439&quot;/&gt; This all but destroyed the 27th (Inniskilling) Regiment, and the 30th and 73rd Regiments suffered such heavy losses that they had to combine to form a viable square</span>
				<span class='text'>Wellington's centre was now on the verge of collapse and wide open to an attack from the French</span>
				<span class='text'>Luckily for Wellington, Pirch I's and [[Hans Ernst Karl, Graf von Zieten|Zieten]]'s corps of the Prussian Army were now at hand</span>
				<span class='text'>Zieten's corps permitted the two fresh cavalry brigades of Vivian and Vandeleur on Wellington's extreme left to be moved and posted behind the depleted centre</span>
				<span class='text'>Pirch I Corps then proceeded to support Bülow and together they regained possession of Plancenoit, and once more the Charleroi road was swept by Prussian round shot</span>
				<span class='text'>The value of this reinforcement at this particular moment can hardly be overestimated</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;The French army now fiercely attacked the Coalition all along the line with the culminating point being reached when Napoleon sent forward the Imperial Guard at 19:30</span>
				<span class='text'>The attack of the Imperial Guards was mounted by five battalions of the Middle Guard, and not by the Grenadiers or Chasseurs of the Old Guard</span>
				<span class='text'>Marching through a hail of canister and skirmisher fire and severely outnumbered, the 3,000 or so Middle Guardsmen advanced to the west of La Haye Sainte and proceeded to separate into three distinct attack forces</span>
				<span class='text'>One, consisting of two battalions of Grenadiers, defeated the Coalition's first line and marched on</span>
				<span class='text'>[[David Hendrik Chassé|Chassé]]'s relatively fresh Dutch division was sent against them and Allied artillery fired into the victorious Grenadiers' flank</span>
				<span class='text'>This still could not stop the Guard's advance, so Chassé ordered his first brigade to charge the outnumbered French, who faltered and broke</span>

				<span class='text'>Wellington's comparable strategic gamble was to leave 17,000 troops and artillery, mostly Dutch and Belgian, {{Convert|8</span>

				<span class='text'>p</span>
				<span class='text'>49</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The campaign led to numerous other controversies, especially concerning the Prussians</span>
				<span class='text'>For example: Were Wellington's troop dispositions prior to Napoleon's invasion of Belgium sound? Did Wellington somehow mislead or betray Blücher by promising, then failing, to come directly to Blücher's aid at Ligny? Who deserved the lion's share of credit for the victory—Wellington or the Prussians? These and other such issues concerning Blücher's, Wellington's, and Napoleon's decisions during the campaign were the subject of a major strategic-level study by the famous Prussian political-military theorist [[Carl von Clausewitz]], ''Feldzug von 1815: Strategische Uebersicht des Feldzugs von 1815'',&lt;ref&gt;Feldzug von 1815: Strategische Uebersicht des Feldzugs von 1815, in Carl von Clausewitz, Schriften—Aufsätze—Studien—Briefe, 2 volumes in 3, edited by Werner Hahlweg (Göttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1966–90), volume 2, part 2: 936–1118</span>

				<span class='text'>Written c</span>
				<span class='text'>827, this study was Clausewitz's last such work and is widely considered to be the best example of Clausewitz's mature theories concerning such analyses</span>

				<span class='text'>While Wellington disputed Clausewitz on several points, the Prussian writer largely absolved Wellington of accusations leveled against him by nationalistic German ax-grinders</span>
				<span class='text'>This exchange with Clausewitz was quite famous in Britain in the 19th century (it was heavily discussed in, for example, Chesney's ''Waterloo Lectures'' (1868)</span>
				<span class='text'>It seems, however, to have been systematically ignored by British historians writing since 1914, which is odd considering that it was one of only two discussions of the battle that Wellington wrote</span>
				<span class='text'>The explanation, unfortunately, is probably that it drew too much attention to the decisive German role in Wellington's victory—which Wellington himself was perfectly happy to acknowledge, but which became an awkward subject given Anglo-German hostilities in the 20th century</span>
