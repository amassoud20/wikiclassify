				<span class='text'>quot;|source=—Barbara Sinatra on Sinatra's voice and musical understanding</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=240}}}}While Sinatra never formally learned how to read music, he had a fine, natural understanding of it,{{sfn|Lees|1998|p=102}} and he worked very hard from a young age to improve his abilities in all aspects of music</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Sinatra|1986|p=31}} He did, however, learn to follow a lead sheet during a performance by &quot;carefully following the patterns and groupings of notes arranged on the page&quot; and made his own notations to the music, using his ear to detect semi-tonal differences</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Granata|2003|p=38}} Granata states that some of the most accomplished classically trained musicians soon noticed his musical understanding, and remarked that Sinatra had a &quot;sixth sense&quot;, which &quot;demonstrated unusual proficiency when it came to detecting incorrect notes and sounds within the orchestra&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Granata|2003|p=30}} Sinatra was an aficionado of classical music,{{sfn|Friedwald|1995|p=21}} and would often request classical strains in his music, inspired by composers and [[Puccini]] and other Impressionist masters</span>
				<span class='text'>His personal favorite was [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Granata|2003|p=93}}  He would insist on always recording live with the band because it gave him a &quot;certain feeling&quot; to perform live surrounded by musicians</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Granata|2003|p=112}} By the mid 1940s, such was his understanding of music that after hearing an [[air check]] of some compositions by [[Alec Wilder]] which were for strings and woodwinds, he became the conductor at Columbia Records for six of Wilder's compositions:  &quot;Air for Oboe&quot;, &quot;Air for English Horn&quot;, &quot;Air for Flute&quot;, &quot;Air for Bassoon&quot;, &quot;Slow Dance&quot; and &quot;Theme and Variations&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{efn|Mitch Miller played English horn and oboe on the Sinatra-led recordings</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lees|1998|p=102}}}} The works, which combine elements of jazz and classical music were considered by Wilder to have been among the finest renditions and recordings of his compositions-past or present</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lees|1998|p=102}} At one recording session with arranger [[Claus Ogerman]] and an orchestra, Sinatra heard &quot;a couple of little strangers&quot; in the string section, prompting Ogerman to make corrections to what were thought to be copyist's errors</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lees|1998|p=102}} Critic Gene Lees, a lyricist and the author of the words to the Jobim melody &quot;This Happy Madness&quot;, expressed amazement when he heard Sinatra's recording of it on ''[[Sinatra &amp; Company]]'' (1971), considering him to have worded the lyrics in the way that he had intended when writing them to perfection</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lees|1998|pp=102–103}}Voice coach John Quinlan was impressed by Sinatra's vocal range, remarking, &quot;He has far more voice that people think he has</span>
				<span class='text'>He can vocalize to a B-flat on top in full voice, and he doesn't need a mic either&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=45}}  As a singer, early on he was primarily influenced by Bing Crosby,{{sfn|Lahr|2000|p=56}} but later believed that [[Tony Bennett]] was &quot;the best singer in the business&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=98}} According to Nelson Riddle, Sinatra had a &quot;fairly rangy voice&quot;,{{efn|Riddle notes that Sinatra's range was from the low G to the high F, almost two octaves, but that his practical range was the low A-flat to a D, in comparison to Bing Crosby whose range was G to C</span>
				<span class='text'>Sinatra could &quot;surpass him by probably as much as four tones at the top&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Granata|2003|p=11}} Though Riddle stated that Sinatra's lowest was G, it should be noted that he often hit the low F in concerts, and hit the low F at 0:41 in the recording of &quot;[[What Is This Thing Called Love?]]&quot; for the 1955 album ''In the Wee Small Hours''</span>
				<span class='text'>}  remarking that &quot;His voice has a very strident, insistent sound in the top register, a smooth lyrical sound in the middle register, and a very tender sound in the low</span>
				<span class='text'>His voice is built on infinite taste, with an overall inflection of sex</span>
				<span class='text'>He points everything he does from a sexual standpoint&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Granata|2003|p=11}} Despite his heavy New Jersey accent, according to Richard Schuller, when Sinatra sang his accent was &quot;virtually undetectable&quot;, with his diction becoming &quot;precise&quot; and articulation &quot;meticulous&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Granata|2003|p=11}} His timing was impeccable, allowing him, according to Charles L</span>
				<span class='text'>Granata, to &quot;toy with the rhythm of a melody, bringing tremendous excitement to his reading of a lyric&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Granata|2003|p=13}}  Tommy Dorsey observed that Sinatra would &quot;take a musical phrase and play it all the way through seemingly without breathing for eight, ten, maybe sixteen bars</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Dorsey was a considerable influence on Sinatra's techniques for his vocal phrasing with his own exceptional breath control on the trombone,{{sfn|Lees|1998|pp=95–96}} and Sinatra regularly swam and held his breath underwater, thinking of song lyrics to increase his breathing power</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|Sinatra with Axel Stordahl at the Liederkrantz Hall in New York, {{circa}} 1947]]Arranger Nelson Riddle found Sinatra to be a &quot;perfectionist who drove himself and everybody around him relentlessly&quot;, and stated that his collaborators approached him with a sense of uneasiness because of his unpredictable and often volatile temperament</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=234}}  Granata comments that Sinatra was almost fanatically obsessed with perfection to the point that people began wondering if he was genuinely concerned about the music or showing off his power over others</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Granata|2003|p=50}} On days when he felt that his voice was not right, he would know after only a few notes and would postpone the recording session until the following day, yet still pay his musicians</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Granata|2003|p=105}}  After a period of performing, Sinatra tired of singing a certain set of songs and was always looking for talented new songwriters and composers to work with</span>
				<span class='text'>Once he found ones that he liked, he actively sought to work with them as often as he could, and made friends with many of them</span>
				<span class='text'>He once told [[Sammy Cahn]], who wrote songs for ''Anchor's Away'', &quot;if you're not there Monday, I'm not there Monday&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Over the years he recorded 87 of Cahn's songs, of which 24 were composed by [[Jule Styne]], and 43 by Jimmy Van Heusen</span>
				<span class='text'>The Cahn-Styne partnership lasted from 1942 until 1954, when Van Heusen succeeded him as Sinatra's main composer</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Granata|2003|pp=14–16}} Unlike many of his contemporaries, Sinatra insisted upon direct input regarding arrangements and tempos for his recordings</span>
				<span class='text'>He would spend weeks thinking about the songs he wanted to record, and would keep an arranger in mind for each song</span>
				<span class='text'>If it were a mellow love song, he would ask for Gordon Jenkins</span>
				<span class='text'>If it were a &quot;rhythm&quot; number, he would think of Billy May, or perhaps Neil Hefti or some other favored arranger</span>
				<span class='text'>Jenkins considered Sinatra's musical sense to be unerring</span>
				<span class='text'>His changes to Riddle's charts would frustrate Riddle, yet he would usually concede that Sinatra's ideas were superior</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Friedwald|1995|pp=28–29}} Barbara Sinatra notes that Sinatra would almost always credit the songwriter at the end of each number, and would often make comments to the audience, such as &quot;Isn't that a pretty ballad&quot; or &quot;Don't you think that's the most marvelous love song&quot; , delivered with &quot;childlike delight&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=140}} She states that after each show, Sinatra would be &quot;in a buoyant, electrically charged mood, a post-show high that would take him hours to come down from as he quietly relived every note of the performance he'd just given&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=142}}{{quote box|width=30em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=&quot;His voice is more interesting now: he has separated his voice into different colors, in different registers</span>
				<span class='text'>Years ago, his voice was more even, and now it is divided into at least three interesting ranges: low, middle, and high</span>
				<span class='text'>[He's] probing more deeply into his songs than he used to</span>
				<span class='text'>That may be due to the ten years he's put on, and the things he's been through</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;|source=—Nelson Riddle noting the development of Sinatra's voice in 1955</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Granata|2003|p=137}}}}Sinatra's split with Gardner in the fall of 1953 had a profound impact on the types of songs he sang and his voice</span>
				<span class='text'>He began to console himself in songs with a &quot;brooding melancholy&quot;, such as &quot;[[I'm a Fool to Want You]]&quot;, &quot;[[Don't Worry 'Bout Me]]&quot;, &quot;[[My One and Only Love]]&quot; and [[There Will Never Be Another You]]&quot;,{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=232}} which Riddle believed was the direct influence of Ava Gardner</span>
				<span class='text'>Lahr comments that the new Sinatra was &quot;not the gentle boy balladeer of the forties</span>
				<span class='text'>Fragility had gone from his voice, to be replaced by a virile adult's sense of happiness and hurt&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lahr|2000|p=69}} Author Granata considered Sinatra to have been a &quot;master of the art of recording&quot;, noting that his work in the studio &quot;set him apart from other gifted vocalists&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>During his career he made over 1000 recordings</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Granata|2003|pp=xiii–xvi}} Recording sessions would typically last three hours, though Sinatra would always prepare for it by spending at least an hour by the piano beforehand to vocalize, followed by a short rehearsal with the orchestra to ensure the balance of sound</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Granata|2003|p=36}} During his Columbia years Sinatra would use a RCA 44 microphone, which Granata describes as &quot;the 'old-fashioned' microphone which is closely associated with Sinatra's crooner image of the 1940s&quot;, though when performing on talk shows later he would use a bullet-shaped [[RCA Type 77-DX microphone|RCA 77]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Granata|2003|p=37}} At Capitol he used a [[Neumann U47]], an &quot;ultra-sensitive&quot; microphone which better captured the timbre and tone of his voice</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Granata|2003|pp=111–112}}In the 1950s, Sinatra's career was facilitated by developments in technology</span>
				<span class='text'>As disc jockey [[Jonathan Schwartz (radio)|Jonathan Schwartz]] said, &quot;Never before had there been an opportunity for a popular singer to express emotions at an extended length&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>In the words of author John Lahr, &quot;as many as sixteen songs could be held by the twelve-inch L</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> and this allowed Sinatra to use song in a novelistic way, turning each track in a kind of chapter, which built and counterpointed moods to illuminate a larger theme&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lahr|2000|pp=69–70}} Santopietro writes that through the 1950s, well into the 1960s, &quot;every Sinatra LP was a masterpiece of one sort of another, whether uptempo, torch song, or swingin' affairs</span>
