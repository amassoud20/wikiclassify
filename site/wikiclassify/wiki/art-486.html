				<span class='text'>-inch howitzer, [[Hastings]], Sussex, May 1940]]During most of the late 1930s and early 1940s, Milligan performed as an amateur jazz vocalist and trumpeter before, during and after being [[conscripted|called up]] for military service in the fight against [[Nazi Germany]], but even then he wrote and performed comedy sketches as part of concerts to entertain troops</span>
				<span class='text'>After his call-up but before being sent abroad, he and fellow musician Harry Edgington (1919–1993)&lt;ref&gt;The Independent 12/30/93&lt;/ref&gt; (whose nickname 'Edge-ying-Tong', inspired one of Milligan's most memorable musical creations, the &quot;[[Ying Tong Song]]&quot;) would compose surreal stories, filled with puns and skewed logic, as a way of staving off the boredom of life in barracks</span>
				<span class='text'>One biographer describes his early dance band work as follows: &quot;He managed to croon like [[Bing Crosby]] and win a competition: he also played drums, guitar and trumpet, in which he was entirely self taught&quot;; he also acquired a double bass, on which he took lessons and would strum in jazz sessions</span>

				<span class='text'>52–53</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Milligan had [[perfect pitch]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}During the Second World War, Milligan served as a [[signaller]] in the 56th Heavy Regiment [[Royal Regiment of Artillery|Royal Artillery]], D Battery, as Gunner Milligan, 954024</span>
				<span class='text'>The unit was equipped with the obsolete [[First World War]] era [[BL 9</span>
				<span class='text'>-inch howitzer]] and based in [[Bexhill-on-Sea|Bexhill]] on the south coast of England</span>
				<span class='text'>Milligan describes training with these guns in part two of ''Adolf Hitler: My Part in His Downfall'', claiming that, during training, gun crews resorted to shouting &quot;bang&quot; in unison as they had no shells with which to practise</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Milligan |first=Spike |title=Adolf Hitler: My Part in His Downfall |year=1971 |publisher=Michael Joseph |pages=36, 81 }}&lt;/ref&gt;The unit was later re-equipped with the [[BL 7</span>
				<span class='text'>-inch howitzer]] and saw action as part of the [[British First Army|First Army]] in the [[North African campaign]] and then in the succeeding [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian campaign]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Milligan was appointed [[lance bombardier]] and was about to be promoted to [[Bombardier (rank)|bombardier]], when he was [[wounded in action]] in the Italian theatre at the [[Battle of Monte Cassino]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Subsequently hospitalised for a mortar wound to the right leg and [[shell shock]], he was demoted by an unsympathetic commanding officer (identified in his war diaries as Major Evan &quot;Jumbo&quot; Jenkins) back to Gunner</span>
				<span class='text'>It was Milligan's opinion that Major Jenkins did not like him, because Milligan constantly kept the morale of his fellow soldiers up, whereas Jenkins' approach was to take an attitude towards the troops similar to that of [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=April 2012}} An incident also mentioned was when Jenkins had invited Gunners Milligan and Edgington to his bivouac to play some jazz with him, only to discover that the musicianship of the gunners was far superior to his own ability to play the military tune &quot;Whistling Rufus&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>fter hospitalisation, Milligan drifted through a number of rear-echelon military jobs in Italy, eventually becoming a full-time entertainer</span>
				<span class='text'>He played the guitar with a jazz and comedy group called ''[[The Bill Hall Trio]]'', in concert parties for the troops</span>
				<span class='text'>After being demobilised, Milligan remained in Italy playing with the trio but returned to [[UK|Britain]] soon after</span>
				<span class='text'>While he was with the [[Central Pool of Artists]] (a group he described as composed &quot;of bomb-happy [[squaddie]]s&quot;) he began to write parodies of their mainstream plays, which displayed many of the key elements of what would later become ''The Goon Show'' (originally called ''Crazy People'') with [[Peter Sellers]], [[Harry Secombe]] and [[Michael Bentine]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}==Career=====''The Goon Show''===Milligan returned to jazz in the late 1940s and made a precarious living with the Hall trio and other musical comedy acts</span>
				<span class='text'>He was also trying to break into the world of radio, as a performer or script writer</span>
				<span class='text'>His first success in radio was as writer for comedian [[Derek Roy (comedian)|Derek Roy]]'s show</span>
				<span class='text'>After a delayed start, Milligan, [[Peter Sellers]], [[Harry Secombe]] and [[Michael Bentine]] joined forces in a relatively radical comedy project, ''[[The Goon Show]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>During its first season the BBC titled the show as ''Crazy People'', or in full, ''The Junior Crazy Gang featuring those Crazy People, the Goons!'', an attempt to make the programme palatable to BBC officials, by connecting it with the popular group of theatre comedians known as [[The Crazy Gang]]</span>

				<span class='text'>112</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Although he did not perform as much in the early shows, Milligan eventually became a lead performer in almost all of the ''Goon Show'' episodes, portraying a wide range of characters including [[Eccles (character)|Eccles]], [[Minnie Bannister]], Jim Spriggs and the nefarious [[Count Moriarty]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, 2003, p</span>
				<span class='text'>119</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He was also the primary author of most of the scripts, although he co-wrote many scripts with various collaborators, most notably [[Larry Stephens (scriptwriter)|Larry Stephens]] and [[Eric Sykes]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Most of the early shows were co-written with Stephens (and edited by [[Jimmy Grafton]]) but this partnership faltered after Series 3</span>
				<span class='text'>Milligan wrote most of Series 4 but from Series 5 (coinciding with the birth of the Milligans' second child, Seán) and through most of Series 6, he collaborated with [[Eric Sykes]], a development that grew out of his contemporary business collaboration with Sykes in [[Associated London Scripts]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, 2003, p</span>
				<span class='text'>182</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Milligan and Stephens reunited during Series 6 but towards the end of Series 8 Stephens was sidelined by health problems and Milligan worked briefly with [[John Antrobus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Milligan-Stephens partnership was finally ended by Stephens' death from a brain haemorrhage in January 1959; Milligan later downplayed and disparaged Stephens' contributions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, 2003, p</span>
				<span class='text'>190</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;''The Goon Show'' was recorded before a studio audience and during the audience warm-up session, Milligan would play the trumpet, while Peter Sellers played on the orchestra's drums</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Robson&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Spike Milligan: His Part in Our Lives|author=Ventham, Maxine|chapter=Jeremy Robson|year=2002|publisher=Robson|location= London|isbn=1-86105-530-7|pages=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first few years the shows were recorded live, direct to 16-inch [[transcription disc]], which required the cast to adhere closely to the script but by Series 4, the BBC had adopted the use of magnetic tape</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Carpenter, 2003, p</span>
				<span class='text'>20&quot;&gt;Carpenter, 2003, p</span>
				<span class='text'>120</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Milligan eagerly exploited the possibilities the new technology offered—the tapes could be edited, so the cast could now ad-lib freely and tape also enabled the creation of groundbreaking sound effects</span>
				<span class='text'>Over the first three series, Milligan's demands for increasingly complex sound effects (or 'grams', as they were then known) pushed technology and the skills of the BBC engineers to their limits—effects had to be created mechanically ([[foley (filmmaking)|foley]]) or played back from discs, sometimes requiring the use of four or five turntables running simultaneously</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Carpenter, 2003, p</span>
				<span class='text'>20&quot;/&gt; With magnetic tape, these effects could be produced in advance and the BBC engineers were able to create highly complex, tightly edited effects 'stings' that would have been very difficult (if not impossible) to perform using foley or disc</span>
				<span class='text'>In the later years of the series many Goon Show 'grams' were produced for the series by members of the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]], a notable example being the &quot;[[Major Bloodnok]]'s Stomach&quot; effect, realised by [[Dick Mills]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough the Goons elevated Milligan to international [[stardom]], the demands of writing and performing the series took a heavy toll</span>
				<span class='text'>During Series 3 he suffered the first of several serious [[mental breakdown]]s, which also marked the onset of a decades-long cycle of [[Bipolar disorder|manic-depressive]] illness</span>
				<span class='text'>In late 1952, possibly exacerbated by suppressed tensions between the Goons' stars, Milligan apparently became irrationally convinced that he had to kill Sellers but when he attempted to gain entry to Sellers's neighbouring flat, armed with a potato knife, he accidentally walked straight through the plate-glass front door</span>
				<span class='text'>He was hospitalised, heavily sedated for two weeks and spent almost two months recuperating; fortunately for the show, a backlog of scripts meant that his illness had little effect on production</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, 2003, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>136–139</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Milligan later blamed the pressure of writing and performing ''The Goon Show'', for both his breakdown and the failure of his first marriage</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Spike Milligan, ''More Goon Show Scripts'' (Sphere Books, London, 1973, ISBN 0-7221-6077-1), p</span>
				<span class='text'>13&lt;/ref&gt;A lesser-known aspect of Milligan's life in the 1950s and 1960s, was his involvement in the writers' agency [[Associated London Scripts]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Milligan married for the first time and began a family</span>
				<span class='text'>This reportedly distracted him from writing so much, that he accepted an invitation from [[Eric Sykes]] to share his small office, leading to the creation of the co-operative agency</span>
				<span class='text'>==Television===Milligan made several forays into television as a writer-performer, in addition to his many guest appearances on interview, variety and sketch comedy series from the 1950s to the 2000s</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[The Idiot Weekly, Price 2d]]'' (1956) starring Peter Sellers, was the first attempt to translate Goons humour to TV; it was followed by ''[[A Show Called Fred]]'' and ''[[Son of Fred]]'', both made during 1956 and directed by [[Richard Lester]], who went on to work with the [[The Beatles|Beatles]]</span>
				<span class='text'>During a visit to Australia in 1958, a similar special was made for the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|Australian Broadcasting Commission]], &quot;The Gladys Half-Hour&quot;, which also featured local actors [[Ray Barrett]] and [[John Bluthal]], who would appear in several later Milligan projects</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1961, Milligan co-wrote two episodes of the popular sitcom ''[[Sykes and a</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>]'', co-starring Sykes and [[Hattie Jacques]] and the one-off &quot;Spike Milligan Offers A Series of Unrelated Incidents at Market Value&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>he 15-minute series ''[[The Telegoons]]'' (1963), was the next attempt to transplant the Goons to television, this time using [[puppet]] versions of the familiar characters</span>
				<span class='text'>The initial intention was to 'visualise' original recordings of 1950s Goon Show episodes but this proved difficult, because of the rapid-fire dialogue and was ultimately frustrated by the BBC's refusal to allow the original audio to be used</span>
				<span class='text'>15-minute adaptations of the original scripts by Maurice Wiltshire were used instead, with Milligan, Sellers and Secombe reuniting to provide the voices; according to a contemporary press report, they received the highest fees the BBC had ever paid for 15-minute shows</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>tm |date=20060501091150 |df=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two series were made in 1963 and 1964 and (presumably because it was shot on 35mm film rather than video) the entire series has reportedly been preserved in the BBC archives</span>
				<span class='text'>illigan's next major TV venture was the sketch comedy series ''[[The World of Beachcomber]]'' (1968), made in colour for [[BBC Two|BBC 2]]; it is believed all 19 episodes are [[Wiping|lost]]</span>
				<span class='text'>That same year, the three Goons reunited for a televised re-staging of a vintage Goon Show for [[Thames Television]], with [[John Cleese]] substituting for the late [[Wallace Greenslade]] but the pilot was not successful and no further programmes were made</span>
				<span class='text'>n early 1969, Milligan starred in the ill-fated situation comedy ''[[Curry &amp; Chips]]'', created and written by [[Johnny Speight]] and featuring Milligan's old friend and colleague Eric Sykes</span>
				<span class='text'>''Curry &amp; Chips'' set out to satirise racist attitudes in Britain in a similar vein to Speight's earlier creation, the hugely successful ''[[Till Death Us Do Part]]'', with Milligan 'blacking up' to play Kevin O'Grady, a half-Pakistani–half-Irish factory worker</span>
				<span class='text'>The series generated numerous complaints, because of its frequent use of racist epithets and 'bad language' – one viewer reportedly complained of counting 59 uses of the word &quot;bloody&quot; in one episode – and it was cancelled on the orders of the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]] after only six episodes</span>
				<span class='text'> Milligan was also involved in the ill-fated programme ''[[The Melting Pot (television programme)|The Melting Pot]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>irector [[John Goldschmidt]]'s film ''The Other Spike'' dramatised Milligan's nervous breakdown in a film for [[Granada Television]], for which Milligan wrote the screenplay and in which he played himself</span>
				<span class='text'>Later that year, he was commissioned by the BBC to write and star in ''Q5'', the first in the innovative [[Q (TV series)|&quot;Q&quot;]] TV series, acknowledged as an important precursor to ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'', which premiered several months later</span>
				<span class='text'>There was a hiatus of several years, before the BBC commissioned ''Q6'' in 1975</span>
				<span class='text'>''Q7'' appeared in 1977, ''[[Q (TV series)|Q8]]'' in 1978, ''Q9'' in 1980 and ''[[There's a Lot of It About]]'' in 1982</span>
				<span class='text'>Milligan later complained of the BBC's cold attitude towards the series and stated that he would have made more programs, had he been given the opportunity</span>
				<span class='text'>A number of episodes of the earlier &quot;Q&quot; series are missing, presumed wiped</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} In 1979 he was a special guest star on The Muppet Show</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=September 2013}}From 1995 to 1998, he voiced the highly successful children's animated series ''[[Wolves, Witches and Giants]]'' for ITV</span>
				<span class='text'>The series was written by Ed Welch, who had featured in the &quot;Q&quot; series, collaborated with Spike on several audio productions, produced and directed by Simon &amp; Sara Bor</span>
				<span class='text'>The series was shown in over 100 territories including the UK and USA</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}===Poetry and other writings===Milligan also wrote verse, considered to be within the genre of [[literary nonsense]]</span>

				<span class='text'>He also wrote a novel ''[[Puckoon]]'' and a series of war memoirs, including ''[[Adolf Hitler: My Part in His Downfall]]'' (1971), ''[[&quot;Rommel?&quot; &quot;Gunner Who?&quot;|&quot;Rommel?&quot; &quot;Gunner Who?&quot;: A Confrontation in the Desert]]'' (1974), ''[[Monty: His Part in My Victory]]'' (1976) and ''[[Mussolini: His Part in My Downfall]]'' (1978)</span>
				<span class='text'>Milligan's seven volumes of memoirs cover the years from 1939 to 1950 (his call-up, war service, first breakdown, time spent entertaining in Italy and return to the UK)</span>
				<span class='text'>{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}He also wrote comedy songs, including &quot;Purple Aeroplane&quot;, which was a parody of the Beatles' song &quot;[[Yellow Submarine (song)|Yellow Submarine]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Glimpses of his bouts with depression, which led to the nervous breakdowns, can be found in his serious poetry, which is compiled in ''Open Heart University''</span>
				<span class='text'>{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}=== Theatre =======''Treasure Island''====[[Bernard Miles]] gave Milligan his first straight acting role, as [[Treasure Island#Theatre and radio|Ben Gunn]], in the [[Mermaid Theatre]] production of ''[[Treasure Island]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Miles described Milligan as:{{quote|</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>a man of quite extraordinary talents&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>a visionary who is out there alone, denied the usual contacts simply because he is so different he can't always communicate with his own species&amp;nbsp;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;}}''Treasure Island'' played twice daily through the winter of 1961–62 and was an annual production at the Mermaid Theatre for some years</span>
				<span class='text'>In the 1968 production, [[Barry Humphries]] played the role of Long John Silver, alongside [[Willie Rushton|William Rushton]] as [[Squire Trelawney]] and Milligan as Ben Gunn</span>
				<span class='text'>To Humphries, Milligan's &quot;best performance must surely have been as Ben Gunn&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'>, Milligan stole the show every night, in a makeup which took at least an hour to apply</span>
				<span class='text'>His appearance on stage always brought a roar of delight from the kids in the audience and Spike had soon left the text far behind as he went off into a riff of sublime absurdity</span>

				<span class='text'>92–97</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;====''The Bed-Sitting Room''====In 1961–62, during the long pauses between the matinee and the evening show of ''Treasure Island'', Milligan began talking to Miles about the idea he and [[John Antrobus]] were exploring, of a dramatised post-nuclear world</span>
				<span class='text'>This became the one-act play ''[[The Bed-Sitting Room (play)|The Bed-Sitting Room]]'', which Milligan co-wrote with John Antrobus and which premiered at the [[Marlowe Theatre]], [[Canterbury]] on 12 February 1962</span>
				<span class='text'>It was adapted to a longer play and staged by Miles at London's Mermaid Theatre, making its debut on 31 January 1963</span>
				<span class='text'>It was a critical and commercial success and was revived in 1967 with a provincial tour before opening at London's [[Saville Theatre]] on 3 May 1967</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Richard Lester]] later directed [[The Bed-Sitting Room (film)|a film version]], released in 1969</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;====''Oblomov''====On 6 October 1964, Milligan appeared in [[Frank Dunlop (director)|Frank Dunlop]]'s production of the play ''[[Oblomov]]'', at the [[Lyric Theatre (London)|Lyric Theatre]] in London, based on the novel by Russian writer [[Ivan Goncharov]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Per Scudamore's biography:{{quote|Milligan's fans and the theatrical world in general found it hard to believe that he was to appear in a straight play&amp;nbsp;</span>

				<span class='text'>In the story, Oblomov decides to spend his life in bed</span>
				<span class='text'>Spike decided to identify with his character, and told disbelieving reporters that he thought it would be a nice comfortable rest for him</span>
				<span class='text'>This was of course, prevarication</span>
				<span class='text'>Spike was actually intrigued with Oblomov and had read a translation of Ivan Goncharov's novel</span>

				<span class='text'>214–215</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;}}Milligan's involvement transformed the play</span>
				<span class='text'>The first night started poorly, [[Joan Greenwood]] played Olga and later recalled that her husband [[André Morell]] thought the show was so appalling, they should get her out of the play</span>
				<span class='text'>Per Scudamore:{{quote|Nobody seemed at all comfortable in their roles and the audience began to hoot with laughter when Milligan's slipper inadvertently went spinning across the stage into the stalls</span>
				<span class='text'>That was the end of Spike's playing straight</span>
				<span class='text'>The audience demanded a clown, he became a clown</span>
				<span class='text'>When he forgot his words, or disapproved of them, he simply made up what he felt to be more appropriate ones</span>
				<span class='text'>That night there were no riotous first night celebrations and most of the cast seemed to go home stunned</span>
				<span class='text'>The following night Milligan began to ad lib in earnest</span>
				<span class='text'>The text of the show began to change drastically</span>
				<span class='text'>The cast were bedevilled and shaken but they went along with him&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Incredibly, the show began to resolve itself</span>
				<span class='text'>The context changed completely</span>
				<span class='text'>It was turned upside down and inside out</span>
				<span class='text'>Cues and lines became irrelevant as Milligan verbally rewrote the play each night</span>
				<span class='text'>By the end of the week, ''Oblomov'' had changed beyond recognition</span>
				<span class='text'>Andre Morell came again&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>and afterwards said 'the man is a genius</span>
				<span class='text'>He must be a genius—it's the only word for him</span>
				<span class='text'>He's impossible—but he's a genius!'</span>
				<span class='text'>After Oblomov had run for a record-breaking five weeks at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith, it was retitled ''Son of Oblomov'' and moved to the Comedy Theatre in the West End</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ScudamoresMilliganbio215-216&quot;&gt;Scudamore (1985) pp</span>
				<span class='text'>215–216</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;}}In an interview with [[Bernard Braden]], Milligan described theatre as important to him:{{quote|First it was a means of livelihood</span>
				<span class='text'>And I had sort of lagged behind my confederates, that I&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>remained in the writing seat</span>
				<span class='text'>And I realise that basically I was quite a good clown&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>and the one and only chance I ever had to prove that was in ''Oblomov'' when I clowned my way out of what was a very bad script&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>I clowned it into a West End success and uh, we kept changing it all the time</span>

				<span class='text'>The making of the film is detailed in Paul Sutton's 2012 authorised biography ''Becoming Ken Russell'' (ISBN 978-0-9572462-3-2)</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1971 Milligan played a humble village priest in Russell's film ''[[The Devils (film)|The Devils]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The scene was cut from the release print and is considered lost but photographs from the scene, together with [[Murray Melvin]]'s memory of that day's filming, are included in Sutton's 2014 book ''Six English Filmmakers'' (ISBN 978-0-9572462-5-6)</span>
				<span class='text'>==Ad-libbing===As illustrated in the description of his involvement in theatre, Milligan often ad-libbed</span>
				<span class='text'>He also did this on radio and television</span>
				<span class='text'>One of his last screen appearances was in the BBC dramatisation of [[Mervyn Peake]]'s ''[[Gormenghast (TV serial)|Gormenghast]]'' and he was (almost inevitably) noted as an [[Ad lib|ad-libber]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ne of Milligan's ad-lib incidents occurred during a visit to Australia in the late 1960s</span>
				<span class='text'>He was interviewed live on air and remained in the studio for the news broadcast that followed (read by Rod McNeil), during which Milligan constantly interjected, adding his own name to news items</span>

				<span class='text'>The ABC also changed its national policy so that guests had to leave the studio after interviews were complete</span>
				<span class='text'>A tape of the bulletin survives and has been included in an ABC Radio audio compilation, also on the BBC tribute CD, ''Vivat Milligna'' {{sic}}</span>
				<span class='text'>ilm and television director [[Richard Lester]] recalls that the television series ''A Show Called Fred'' was broadcast live</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;I've seen very few moments of genius in my life but I witnessed one with Spike after the first show</span>
				<span class='text'>He had brought around a silent cartoon&quot; and asked Lester if his P</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>took shorthand</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;She said she did</span>
				<span class='text'>'Good, this needs a commentary</span>
				<span class='text'> It was a ten-minute cartoon and Spike could have seen it only once, if that</span>
				<span class='text'>He ad-libbed the commentary for it and it was perfect</span>

				<span class='text'>3–74&lt;/ref&gt;===Cartoons and art===Milligan contributed occasional cartoons to the satirical magazine ''[[Private Eye (magazine)|Private Eye]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Most were visualisations of [[one-line joke]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, a young boy sees the [[Concorde]] and asks his father &quot;What's that?&quot;</span>
