				<span class='text'>group= n}} 15/27&amp;nbsp;April 1891&amp;nbsp;– 5&amp;nbsp;March 1953) was a  [[Russians|Russian]] and [[Soviet]] [[composer]], pianist and [[conducting|conductor]]</span>
				<span class='text'>As the creator of acknowledged masterpieces across numerous [[musical genre]]s, he is regarded as one of the major composers of the 20th century</span>
				<span class='text'>His works include such widely heard works as the March from ''[[The Love for Three Oranges]],'' the suite [[Lieutenant Kijé (Prokofiev)|''Lieutenant Kijé'']], the ballet [[Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev)|''Romeo and Juliet'']] – from which &quot;[[Montagues and Capulets|Dance of the Knights]]&quot; is taken – and ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]</span>
				<span class='text'>' Of the established forms and genres in which he worked, he created – excluding [[juvenilia]] – seven completed [[opera]]s, seven [[Symphony|symphonies]], eight [[ballet]]s, five [[piano concertos]], two [[violin concerto]]s, a [[cello concerto]], and nine completed [[piano sonata]]s</span>
				<span class='text'> graduate of the [[St Petersburg Conservatory]], Prokofiev initially made his name as an iconoclastic composer-pianist, achieving notoriety with a series of ferociously dissonant and virtuosic works for his instrument, including his first two piano concertos</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1915 Prokofiev made a decisive break from the standard composer-pianist category with his orchestral ''[[Scythian Suite]]'', compiled from music originally composed for a ballet commissioned by [[Sergei Diaghilev]] of the [[Ballets Russes]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Diaghilev commissioned three further ballets from Prokofiev – ''[[Chout]],'' ''[[Le pas d'acier (Prokofiev)|Le pas d'acier]]'' and ''[[The Prodigal Son (ballet)|The Prodigal Son]]'' – which at the time of their original production all caused a sensation among both critics and colleagues</span>
				<span class='text'>Prokofiev's greatest interest, however, was opera, and he composed several works in that genre, including ''[[The Gambler (Prokofiev)|The Gambler]]'' and ''[[The Fiery Angel (opera)|The Fiery Angel]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Prokofiev's one operatic success during his lifetime was ''The Love for Three Oranges,'' composed for the [[Chicago Opera Association|Chicago Opera]] and subsequently performed over the following decade in Europe and Russia</span>
				<span class='text'>fter the [[Russian Revolution|Revolution]], Prokofiev left Russia with the official blessing of the Soviet minister [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]], and resided in the United States, then Germany, then Paris, making his living as a composer, pianist and conductor</span>
				<span class='text'>During that time he married a Spanish singer, Carolina Codina, with whom he had two sons</span>
				<span class='text'>In the early 1930s, the Great Depression diminished opportunities for Prokofiev's ballets and operas to be staged in America and western Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>Prokofiev, who regarded himself as composer foremost, resented the time taken by touring as a pianist, and increasingly turned to Soviet Russia for commissions of new music; in 1936 he finally returned to his homeland with his family</span>
				<span class='text'>He enjoyed some success there – notably with ''Lieutenant Kijé,'' ''Peter and the Wolf,'' ''Romeo and Juliet,'' and perhaps above all with ''[[Alexander Nevsky (Prokofiev)|Alexander Nevsky]]</span>
				<span class='text'>'The [[Nazi invasion of the USSR]] spurred him to compose his most ambitious work, an operatic version of Leo Tolstoy's [[War and Peace (opera)|''War and Peace'']]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1948 Prokofiev was criticized for &quot;anti-democratic [[Formalism (music)|formalism]]&quot; and, with his income severely curtailed, was forced to compose Stalinist works, such as ''On Guard for Peace''</span>
				<span class='text'>However, he also enjoyed personal and artistic support from a new generation of Russian performers, notably [[Sviatoslav Richter]] and [[Mstislav Rostropovich]]: for the latter, he composed his [[Symphony-Concerto (Prokofiev)|Symphony-Concerto]], whilst for the former he composed his [[Piano Sonata No</span>

				<span class='text'>== Formal education and controversial early works ===In 1902, Prokofiev's mother met [[Sergei Taneyev]], director of the [[Moscow Conservatory]], who initially suggested that Prokofiev should start lessons in piano and composition with [[Alexander Borisovich Goldenweiser|Alexander Goldenweiser]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nice|2003|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Taneyev was unable to arrange this,&lt;ref name=pbp46&gt;{{harvnb|Prokofiev|1979|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; he instead organised that composer and pianist Reinhold Glière should spend the summer of 1902 in Sontsovka teaching Prokofiev</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=pbp46 /&gt; This first series of lessons culminated, at the 11-year-old Prokofiev's insistence, with the budding composer making his first attempt to write a symphony</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prokofiev|1979|pp=51–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following summer Glière revisited Sontsovka to give further tuition</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Prokofiev, Sergey, article in Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; When decades later Prokofiev wrote about his lessons with Glière, he gave due credit to his teacher's sympathetic method but complained that Glière had introduced him to &quot;square&quot; phrase structure and conventional modulations which he subsequently had to unlearn</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prokofiev|1979|pp=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, equipped with the necessary theoretical tools, Prokofiev started experimenting with dissonant harmonies and unusual time signatures in a series of short piano pieces which he called &quot;ditties&quot; (after the so-called &quot;song form&quot; – more accurately [[ternary form]] – they were based on), laying the basis for his own musical style</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prokofiev|1979|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;Despite his growing talent, Prokofiev's parents hesitated over starting their son on a musical career at such an early age, and considered the possibility of his attending a quality high school in Moscow</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nice|2003|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1904, his mother had decided instead on [[Saint Petersburg]], and she and Prokofiev visited the (then) capital to explore the possibility of their moving there for his education</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prokofiev|1979|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were introduced to composer [[Alexander Glazunov]], a professor at the Conservatory, who asked to see Prokofiev and his music; Glazunov was so impressed that he urged Prokofiev's mother that her son apply to the [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nice|2003|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this point, Prokofiev had composed two more operas, ''Desert Islands'' and ''The Feast during the Plague'', and was working on his fourth, ''Undina''</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nice|2003|pp=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;Several years younger than most of his class, he was viewed as eccentric and arrogant, and he annoyed a number of his classmates by keeping statistics on the errors made by fellow students</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaffé|1998|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, he studied under, among others, [[Alexander Winkler (composer)|Alexander Winkler]] for piano,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Prokofiev's Piano Sonatas: A Guide for the Listener and the Performer |last=Berman |first=Boris |authorlink=Boris Berman |year=2008 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, Connecticut |isbn=978-0-300-11490-4 |page=35 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anatoly Lyadov]] for harmony and counterpoint, [[Nikolai Tcherepnin]] for conducting, and [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] for orchestration (though when Rimsky-Korsakov died in 1908, Prokofiev noted that he had only studied with him &quot;after a fashion&quot; – he was just one of many students in a heavily attended class—and regretted that he otherwise &quot;never had the opportunity to study with him&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prokofiev|2006|section=Diary 3 August 1908|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also shared classes with the composers [[Boris Asafyev]] and [[Nikolai Myaskovsky]], the latter becoming a relatively close and lifelong friend</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nice|2003|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;As a member of the Saint Petersburg music scene, Prokofiev developed a reputation as a musical rebel, while getting praise for his original compositions, which he performed himself on the piano</span>

				<span class='text'>He continued at the Conservatory, studying piano under [[Anna Yesipova]] and continuing his conducting lessons under Tcherepnin</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prokofiev|2000|pp=240–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;In 1910, Prokofiev's father died and Sergei's financial support ceased</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaffé|1998|pp=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fortunately he had started making a name for himself as a composer and pianist outside the Conservatory, making appearances at the St Petersburg Evenings of Contemporary Music</span>
				<span class='text'>There he performed several of his more adventurous piano works, such as his highly [[chromatic]] and [[consonance and dissonance|dissonant]] Etudes, Op</span>
				<span class='text'>2 (1909)</span>
				<span class='text'>His performance of this impressed the organizers of Evenings sufficiently for them to invite Prokofiev to give the Russian premiere of [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s [[Drei Klavierstücke|Drei Klavierstücke, Op</span>

				<span class='text'>Believing that Russia &quot;had no use for music at the moment&quot;, Prokofiev decided to try his fortunes in America until the turmoil in his homeland had passed</span>
				<span class='text'>He set out for Moscow and Petersburg in March 1918 to sort out financial matters and to arrange for his passport</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prokofiev|1991|p=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May he headed for the USA, having obtained official permission to do so from [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]], the People's Commissar for Education, who told him: &quot;You are a revolutionary in music, we are revolutionaries in life</span>

				<span class='text'>His debut solo concert in New York led to several further engagements</span>
				<span class='text'>He also received a contract from the music director of the [[Chicago Opera Association]], [[Cleofonte Campanini]], for the production of his new opera ''[[The Love for Three Oranges]]'';&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prokofiev|2008|p=364}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, due to Campanini's illness and death, the premiere was postponed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prokofiev|1991|p=266}}&lt;/ref&gt; This delay was another example of Prokofiev's bad luck in operatic matters</span>
				<span class='text'>The failure also cost him his American solo career, since the opera took too much time and effort</span>
				<span class='text'>He soon found himself in financial difficulties, and, in April 1920, he left for Paris, not wanting to return to Russia as a failure</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prokofiev|1991|pp=267–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;In Paris Prokofiev reaffirmed his contacts with Diaghilev's [[Ballets Russes]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prokofiev|1991|p=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also completed some of his older, unfinished works, such as the [[Piano Concerto No</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prokofiev|1991|pp=270–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Love for Three Oranges'' finally premièred in Chicago, under the composer's baton, on 30 December 1921</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prokofiev|2008|p=654}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diaghilev became sufficiently interested in the opera to request Prokofiev play the vocal score to him in June 1922, while they were both in Paris for a revival of ''Chout'', so he could consider it for a possible production</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=prok2008680&gt;{{harvnb|Prokofiev|2008|p=680}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Prokofiev, Stravinsky &quot;became incandescent with rage&quot; and &quot;we almost came to blows and were separated only with difficulty&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=prok2008680/&gt; As a result, &quot;our relations became strained and for several years Stravinsky's attitude toward me was critical</span>

				<span class='text'>By this time his later music had acquired a following in Russia, and he received invitations to return there, but he decided to stay in Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1923, Prokofiev married the Spanish singer Carolina Codina (1897–1989, whose stage name was Lina Llubera)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prokofiev|2008|p=428}}&lt;/ref&gt; before moving back to Paris</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nice|2003|pp=196–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;In Paris, several of his works (for example the [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>2 (Prokofiev)|Second Symphony]]) were performed, but the audiences' reception was now lukewarm and Prokofiev sensed that he &quot;was evidently no longer a sensation&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prokofiev|1991|p=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the Symphony appeared to prompt Diaghilev to commission ''[[Le pas d'acier (Prokofiev)|Le pas d'acier]]'' (''The Steel Step''), a 'modernist' ballet score intended to portray the industrialisation of the Soviet Union</span>
				<span class='text'>It was enthusiastically received by Parisian audiences and critics</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nice|2003|p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt;In around 1924, Prokofiev was introduced to [[Christian Science]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prokofiev|2012|pp=487–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928, Prokofiev completed his [[Symphony No</span>

				<span class='text'>{harvnb|Prokofiev|2012|p=699}}&lt;/ref&gt; He now preferred what he called a &quot;new simplicity&quot;, which he believed more sincere than the &quot;contrivances and complexities&quot; of so much modern music of the 1920s</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prokofiev|2012|p=779}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|That is not to say that Prokofiev approved of simplistic music: when in June 1926 he arranged &quot;a simplified version of the March from ''Oranges'' as a crowd-pleaser&quot;, Prokofiev observed in his diary, &quot;The process of denuding for the sake of simplicity is highly disagreeable&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prokofiev|2012|p=341}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} During 1928–29, Prokofiev composed what was to be the last ballet for Diaghilev, ''[[The Prodigal Son (ballet)|The Prodigal Son]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>When first staged in Paris on 21 May 1929, with [[Serge Lifar]] in the title role, both audience and critics were particularly struck by the final scene in which the prodigal son drags himself across the stage upon his knees to be welcomed by his father</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaffé|1998|pp=110–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diaghilev had recognised that in the music to this scene, Prokofiev had &quot;never been more clear, more simple, more melodious, and more tender</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nice|2003|p=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only months later, Diaghilev was dead</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nice|2003|p=267}}&lt;/ref&gt;That summer, Prokofiev completed the Divertimento, Op</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nice|2003|p=271}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prokofiev was therefore unable to perform in Moscow during his tour shortly after the accident, but he was able to enjoy watching performances of his music from the audience</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prokofiev|1991|p=289}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prokofiev also attended the [[Bolshoi Theatre]]'s &quot;audition&quot; of his ballet ''Le pas d'acier'', and was interrogated by members of the [[Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians]] (RAPM) about the work: he was asked whether the factory portrayed &quot;a capitalist factory, where the worker is a slave, or a Soviet factory, where the worker is the master? If it is a Soviet factory, when and where did Prokofiev examine it, since from 1918 to the present he has been living abroad and came here for the first time in 1927 for two weeks [sic]?&quot; Prokofiev replied, &quot;That concerns politics, not music, and therefore I won't answer</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The RAPM condemned the ballet as a &quot;flat and vulgar anti-Soviet anecdote, a counter-revolutionary composition bordering on Fascism&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The Bolshoi had no option but to reject the ballet</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaffé|1998|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;With his left hand healed, Prokofiev toured the United States successfully at the start of 1930, propped up by his recent European success</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prokofiev|1991|p=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year Prokofiev began his first non-Diaghilev ballet ''[[On the Dnieper (Prokofiev)|On the Dnieper]]'', Op</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nice|2003|p=279}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931 and 1932, he completed his [[Piano Concerto No</span>

				<span class='text'>The following year saw the completion of the [[Symphonic Song (Prokofiev)|Symphonic Song]], Op</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nice|2003|p=310}}&lt;/ref&gt;By the early 1930s, both Europe and America were suffering from the Great Depression, which inhibited both new opera and ballet productions, though audiences for Prokofiev's appearances as a pianist were - in Europe at least - undiminished</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nice|2003|pp=294–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Prokofiev, who saw himself as a composer first and foremost, increasingly resented the amount of time that was lost to composition through his appearances as a pianist</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nice|2003|pp=284}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having been homesick for some time, Prokofiev began to build substantial bridges with the Soviet Union</span>
				<span class='text'>Following the dissolution of the RAPM in 1932, he acted increasingly as a musical ambassador between his homeland and western Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nice|2003|p=303}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his premieres and commissions were increasingly under the auspices of the Soviet Union</span>
				<span class='text'>One such was ''[[Lieutenant Kijé (Prokofiev)|Lieutenant Kijé]]'', which was commissioned as the score to a [[Lieutenant Kijé (film)|Soviet film]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nice|2003|p=304}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another commission, from the Kirov Theatre (as the Mariinsky had now been renamed) in Leningrad, was the ballet ''[[Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev)|Romeo and Juliet]]'', composed to a scenario created by [[Adrian Piotrovsky]] and Sergei Radlov following the precepts of &quot;drambalet&quot; (dramatised ballet, officially promoted at the Kirov to replace works based primarily on choreographic display and innovation)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ezrahi|2012|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Radlov's acrimonious resignation from the Kirov in June 1934, a new agreement was signed with the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow on the understanding that Piotrovsky would remain involved</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morrison|2009|pp=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ballet's original happy ending (contrary to [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]) provoked controversy among Soviet cultural officials;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morrison|2009|pp=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ballet's production was then postponed indefinitely when the staff of the Bolshoi was overhauled at the behest of the chairman of the Committee on Arts Affairs, [[Platon Kerzhentsev]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morrison|2009|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;=== Return to Russia ===In 1936, Prokofiev and his family settled permanently in Moscow</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaffé|1998|pp=143–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that year he composed one of his most famous works, ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]'', for [[Natalya Sats]]'s [[Natalya Sats Musical Theater|Central Children's Theatre]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaffé|1998|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sats also persuaded Prokofiev to write two songs for children – &quot;Sweet Song&quot;, and &quot;Chatterbox&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sats|1979|pp=225–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; these were eventually joined by &quot;The Little Pigs&quot;, published as ''Three Children's Songs'', Op</span>
				<span class='text'>68</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaffé|1998|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prokofiev also composed the gigantic ''[[Cantata for the 20th Anniversary of the October Revolution (Prokofiev)|Cantata for the 20th Anniversary of the October Revolution]],'' originally intended for performance during the anniversary year but effectively blocked by Kerzhentsev, who demanded at the work's audition before the Committee on Arts Affairs, &quot;Just what do you think you're doing, Sergey Sergeyevich, taking texts that belong to the people and setting them to such incomprehensible music?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morrison|2009|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cantata had to wait until 5 April 1966 for a partial premiere (just over 13 years after the composer's death)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morrison|2009|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;Forced to adapt to the new circumstances (whatever misgivings he had about them in private), Prokofiev wrote a series of &quot;[[mass song]]s&quot; (Opp</span>
				<span class='text'>66, 79, 89), using the lyrics of officially approved Soviet poets</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1938, Prokofiev collaborated with Eisenstein on the historical epic ''[[Alexander Nevsky (film)|Alexander Nevsky]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>For this he composed some of his most inventive and dramatic music</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the film had a very poor sound recording, Prokofiev adapted much of his score into a large-scale [[cantata]] for [[mezzo-soprano]], orchestra and chorus, which was extensively performed and recorded</span>
				<span class='text'>In the wake of ''Alexander Nevsky'''s success, Prokofiev composed his first Soviet opera ''[[Semyon Kotko]]'', which was intended to be produced by the director [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]]</span>
				<span class='text'>However the première of the opera was postponed because Meyerhold was arrested on 20 June 1939 by the [[NKVD]] ([[Joseph Stalin]]'s Secret Police), and shot on 2 February 1940</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaffé|1998|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only months after Meyerhold's arrest, Prokofiev was 'invited' to compose ''[[Zdravitsa (Prokofiev)|Zdravitsa]]'' (literally translated 'Cheers!', but more often given the English title ''Hail to Stalin'') (Op</span>
				<span class='text'>85) to celebrate [[Joseph Stalin]]'s 60th birthday</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaffé|1998|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;Later in 1939, Prokofiev composed his Piano Sonatas Nos</span>
				<span class='text'>6, 7, and 8, Opp</span>
				<span class='text'>82–84, widely known today as the &quot;War Sonatas</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Premiered respectively by Prokofiev (No</span>
				<span class='text'>6: 8 April 1940),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morrison|2009|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sviatoslav Richter]] (No</span>
				<span class='text'>7: Moscow, 18 January 1943) and [[Emil Gilels]] (No</span>

				<span class='text'>64&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Morrison|2009|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; they were subsequently championed in particular by Richter</span>
				<span class='text'>Biographer Daniel Jaffé argued that Prokofiev, &quot;having forced himself to compose a cheerful evocation of the [[nirvana]] Stalin wanted everyone to believe he had created&quot; (i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>in ''Zdravitsa'') then subsequently, in these three sonatas, &quot;expressed his true feelings&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaffé|1998|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; As evidence of this, Jaffé has pointed out that the central movement of Sonata No</span>
				<span class='text'>7 opens with a theme based on a [[Robert Schumann]] [[lied]], 'Wehmut' ('Sadness', which appears in Schumann's [[Liederkreis, Op</span>
				<span class='text'>39]]): the words to this translate &quot;I can sometimes sing as if I were glad, yet secretly tears well and so free my heart</span>
				<span class='text'>Nightingales&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>sing their song of longing from their dungeon's depth&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>everyone delights, yet no one feels the pain, the deep sorrow in the song</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaffé|1998|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically (because, it appears, no one had noticed his allusion) Sonata No</span>
				<span class='text'>7 received a [[Stalin Prize]] (Second Class), and No</span>
				<span class='text'>8 a Stalin Prize First Class</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Morrison, p</span>
				<span class='text'>64&quot; /&gt;In the meantime, ''Romeo and Juliet'' was finally staged by the Kirov ballet, choreographed by [[Leonid Lavrovsky]], on 11 January 1940</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaffé|2008|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the surprise of all its participants, the dancers having struggled to cope with the music's syncopated rhythms and almost having boycotted the production, the ballet was an instant success,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaffé|2008|pp=160–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became recognised as the crowning achievement of Soviet dramatic ballet</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ezrahi|2012|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;=== War years ===[[File:Mira Mendelssohn Prokofiev</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|Prokofiev and his second wife, Mira Mendelson]]Prokofiev had been considering making an opera out of [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s epic novel ''[[War and Peace]]'', when news of the German invasion of Russia on 22 June 1941 made the subject seem all the more timely</span>
				<span class='text'>Prokofiev took two years to compose his original version of ''[[War and Peace (opera)|War and Peace]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Because of the war he was evacuated together with a large number of other artists, initially to the [[Caucasus]] where he composed his Second String Quartet</span>
				<span class='text'>By this time his relationship with the 25-year-old writer and librettist Mira Mendelson (1915–1968) had finally led to his separation from his wife Lina, although they were never technically divorced: indeed Prokofiev had tried to persuade Lina and their sons to accompany him as evacuees out of Moscow, but Lina opted to stay</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morrison|2009|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;During the war years, restrictions on style and the demand that composers should write in a 'socialist realist' style were slackened, and Prokofiev was generally able to compose in his own way</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1943 Prokofiev joined Eisenstein in [[Alma-Ata]], the largest city in [[Kazakhstan]], to compose more film music (''[[Ivan the Terrible (Prokofiev)|Ivan the Terrible]]''), and the ballet ''[[Cinderella (Prokofiev)|Cinderella]]'' (Op</span>
				<span class='text'>87), one of his most melodious and celebrated compositions</span>
				<span class='text'>Early that year he also played excerpts from ''War and Peace'' to members of the Bolshoi Theatre collective</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morrison|2009|p=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Soviet government had opinions about the opera which resulted in many revisions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;&quot;Prokofiev wrote the first version of ''War and Peace'' during the Second World War</span>
				<span class='text'>He revised it in the late forties and early fifties, during the period of the 1948 Zhdanov Decree, which attacked obscurantist tendencies in the music of leading Soviet composers</span>

				<span class='text'>tml]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, Prokofiev spent time at a composer's colony outside Moscow in order to compose his [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>5 (Prokofiev)|Fifth Symphony]] (Op</span>
				<span class='text'>100)</span>
				<span class='text'>Prokofiev conducted its first performance on 13 January 1945, just a fortnight after the triumphant premieres on 30 December 1944 of his Eighth Piano Sonata and, on the same day, the first part of Eisenstein's ''Ivan the Terrible''</span>
				<span class='text'>With the premiere of his Fifth Symphony, which was programmed alongside ''Peter and the Wolf'' and the ''Classical'' Symphony (these conducted by [[Nikolai Anosov]]), Prokofiev appeared to reach the peak of his celebrity as a leading composer of the Soviet Union</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaffe|1998|pp=182–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, he suffered a concussion after a fall due to chronic high blood pressure</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morrison|2009|p=252}}&lt;/ref&gt; He never fully recovered from this injury, and was forced on medical advice to restrict his composing activity</span>

				<span class='text'>In early 1948, following a meeting of Soviet composers convened by Andrei Zhdanov, the Politburo issued a resolution denouncing Prokofiev, [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], Myaskovsky, and [[Aram Khachaturian|Khachaturian]] of the crime of &quot;formalism&quot;, described as a &quot;renunciation of the basic principles of classical music&quot; in favour of &quot;muddled, nerve-racking&quot; sounds that &quot;turned music into cacophony&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tomoff|2006|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight of Prokofiev's works were banned from performance: ''The Year 1941'', ''Ode to the End of the War'', ''Festive Poem'', ''Cantata for the Thirtieth Anniversary of October'', ''Ballad of an Unknown Boy'', the 1934 piano cycle ''Thoughts'', and Piano Sonatas Nos 6 and 8</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Morrison314&gt;{{harvnb|Morrison|2009|p=314}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such was the perceived threat behind the banning of these works that even works that had avoided censure were no longer programmed:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morrison|2013|p=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; by August 1948, Prokofiev was in severe financial straits, his personal debt amounting to 180,000 rubles</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Morrison314/&gt;Meanwhile, on 20 February 1948, Prokofiev's wife Lina was arrested for 'espionage', as she had tried to send money to her mother in Spain</span>
				<span class='text'>After nine months of interrogation,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morrison|2013|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; she was sentenced by a three-member Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR to 20 years of hard labour</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morrison|2013|p=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was eventually released after Stalin's death in 1953 and in 1974 left the Soviet Union</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morrison|2013|p=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;Prokofiev's latest opera projects, among them his desperate attempt to appease the cultural authorities, ''[[The Story of a Real Man]]'', were quickly cancelled by the [[Kirov Theatre]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morrison|2009|p=293}}&lt;/ref&gt; This snub, in combination with his declining health, caused Prokofiev progressively to withdraw from public life and from various activities, even his beloved chess, and increasingly he devoted himself exclusively to his own work</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nestyev|1961|p=409}}&lt;/ref&gt;In spring 1949 he wrote his Cello Sonata in C, Op</span>
				<span class='text'>119, for the 22-year-old [[Mstislav Rostropovich]], who gave the first performance in 1950, with Sviatoslav Richter</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nestyev|1961|pp=412–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Rostropovich, Prokofiev also extensively recomposed his Cello Concerto, transforming it into a [[Symphony-Concerto (Prokofiev)|Symphony-Concerto]], his last major masterpiece and a landmark in the cello and orchestra repertory today</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nestyev|1961|pp=426–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last public performance he attended was the première of the [[Symphony No</span>
