				<span class='text'>He was educated at [[Kilkenny College]] and attended [[Trinity College, Dublin]], earning a bachelor's degree in 1704 and completing a master's degree in 1707</span>
				<span class='text'>He remained at Trinity College after completion of his degree as a tutor and Greek lecturer</span>
				<span class='text'>is earliest publication was on mathematics, but the first that brought him notice was his ''[[s:An Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision|An Essay towards a New Theory of Vision]]'', first published in 1709</span>
				<span class='text'>In the essay, Berkeley examines visual distance, magnitude, position and problems of sight and touch</span>
				<span class='text'>While this work raised much controversy at the time, its conclusions are now accepted as an established part of the theory of optics</span>
				<span class='text'>he next publication to appear was the ''[[Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge]]'' in 1710, which had great success and gave him a lasting reputation, though few accepted his theory that nothing exists outside the mind</span>
				<span class='text'>This was followed in 1713 by ''[[Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous]]'', in which he propounded his system of philosophy, the leading principle of which is that the world, as represented by our senses, depends for its existence on being perceived</span>
				<span class='text'>or this theory, the ''Principles'' gives the exposition and the ''Dialogues'' the defence</span>
				<span class='text'>One of his main objectives was to combat the prevailing [[materialism]] of his time</span>
				<span class='text'>The theory was largely received with ridicule, while even those such as [[Samuel Clarke]] and [[William Whiston]], who did acknowledge his &quot;extraordinary genius,&quot; were nevertheless convinced that his first principles were false</span>
				<span class='text'>== England and Europe ===Shortly afterwards, Berkeley visited England and was received into the circle of [[Joseph Addison|Addison]], [[Alexander Pope|Pope]] and [[Richard Steele|Steele]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In the period between 1714 and 1720, he interspersed his academic endeavours with periods of extensive travel in Europe, including one of the most extensive Grand Tours of the length and breadth of Italy ever undertaken</span>

				<span class='text'>London, Routledge</span>
				<span class='text'>2000 ISBN 0714644749&lt;/ref&gt; In 1721, he took [[Holy Orders]] in the [[Church of Ireland]], earning his doctorate in [[divinity]], and once again chose to remain at Trinity College Dublin, lecturing this time in Divinity and in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1721/2 he was made [[Dean of Dromore]] and, in 1724, [[Dean of Derry]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1723, following her violent quarrel with [[Jonathan Swift]], who had been  her intimate friend for many years,  [[Esther Vanhomrigh]]  (for whom Swift had created the nick-name &quot;Vanessa&quot;) named Berkeley her co-heir along with the barrister [[Robert Marshall (Irish judge)|Robert Marshall]]; her choice of legatees caused  a good deal of surprise since she did not know either of them well, although Berkeley as a very young man had known her father</span>
				<span class='text'>Swift said generously that he did not grudge Berkeley his inheritance, much of which vanished in a lawsuit in any event</span>
				<span class='text'>A story that Berkeley and Marshall disregarded a condition of the inheritance that they must publish the correspondence between Swift and Vanessa is probably untrue</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1725, he began the project of founding a college in [[Bermuda]] for training ministers and missionaries in the colony, in pursuit of which he gave up his deanery with its income of £1100</span>
				<span class='text'>== Marriage and America ===In 1728, he married Anne Forster, daughter of [[John Forster (Chief Justice)|John Forster]], [[Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He then went to America on a salary of £100 per annum</span>
				<span class='text'>He landed near [[Newport, Rhode Island]], where he bought a plantation in [[Middletown, Rhode Island]]{{spaced ndash}}the famous &quot;[[Whitehall Museum House|Whitehall]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>It has been claimed that &quot;he introduced [[Palladianism]] into America by borrowing a design from [William] Kent's ''Designs of Inigo Jones'' for the door-case of his house in Rhode Island [Whitehall]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He also brought to New England John Smibert, the British artist he &quot;discovered&quot; in Italy, who is generally regarded as the founding father of American portrait painting</span>
				<span class='text'>Meanwhile, he drew up plans for the ideal city he planned to build on Bermuda</span>

				<span class='text'>324&lt;/ref&gt; He lived at the plantation while he waited for funds for his college to arrive</span>
				<span class='text'>The funds, however, were not forthcoming, and in 1732 he left America and returned to London</span>
				<span class='text'>== Humanitarian work ===While living in London's Saville Street, he took part in efforts to create a home for the city's abandoned children</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Foundling Hospital]] was founded by [[Royal Charter]] in 1739, and Berkeley is listed as one of its original governors</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1734, he was appointed [[Bishop of Cloyne]] in Ireland, a position he was to hold until his death</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon afterwards, he published ''[[Alciphron, or The Minute Philosopher]]'', directed against both [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Shaftesbury]] and [[Bernard de Mandeville]]; and in 1735–37 ''The Querist''</span>
				<span class='text'>== Last works ===His last two publications were ''Siris: Philosophical reflexions and inquiries concerning the virtues of tar-water, and divers other subjects connected together and arising from one another'' (1744) and ''Further Thoughts on Tar-water'' (1752)</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Pine tar]] is an effective antiseptic and disinfectant when applied to cuts on the skin, but Berkeley argued for the use of pine tar as a broad panacea for diseases</span>
				<span class='text'>His 1744 work on tar-water sold more copies than any of his other books during Berkeley's lifetime</span>

				<span class='text'>tanford</span>
				<span class='text'>du/entries/berkeley/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]''&lt;/ref&gt;He remained at Cloyne until 1752, when he retired and went to Oxford to live with his son</span>
				<span class='text'>He died soon afterward and was buried in [[Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His affectionate disposition and genial manners made him much loved and held in warm regard by many of his contemporaries</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pope, in his ''Satires, Epistles, and Odes of Horace'' (Epilogue to the Satires, Dialogue ii, line 73) refers to God granting &quot;To Berkeley every Virtue under Heaven&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;== Contributions to philosophy =={{Main|Subjective idealism}}{{Quotation|According to Berkeley there are only two kinds of things: spirits and ideas</span>
				<span class='text'>Spirits are simple, active beings which produce and perceive ideas; ideas are passive beings which are produced and perceived</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; }}The use of the concepts of &quot;spirit&quot; and &quot;idea&quot; is central in Berkeley's philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>As used by him, these concepts are difficult to translate into modern terminology</span>
				<span class='text'>His concept of &quot;spirit&quot; is close to the concept of &quot;conscious subject&quot; or of &quot;mind&quot;, and the concept of &quot;idea&quot; is close to the concept of &quot;sensation&quot; or &quot;state of mind&quot; or &quot;conscious experience&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>hus Berkeley denied the existence of matter as a [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] substance, but did not deny the existence of physical objects such as apples or mountains</span>
				<span class='text'>(&quot;''I do not argue against the existence of any one thing that we can apprehend, either by sense or reflection</span>
				<span class='text'>That the things I see with mine eyes and touch with my hands do exist, really exist, I make not the least question</span>
				<span class='text'>The only thing whose existence we deny, is that which philosophers call matter or corporeal substance</span>
				<span class='text'>And in doing of this, there is no damage done to the rest of mankind, who, I dare say, will never miss it</span>
				<span class='text'>'&quot;, ''Principles ''#35) This basic claim of Berkeley's thought, his &quot;idealism&quot;, is sometimes and somewhat derisively called &quot;immaterialism&quot; or, occasionally, [[subjective idealism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''Principles #3,'' he wrote, using a combination of Latin and English, ''esse is percipi'' (to be is to be perceived), most often if slightly inaccurately attributed to Berkeley as the pure Latin phrase ''esse est percipi</span>
				<span class='text'>'&lt;ref&gt;Fogelin, Robert ''Berkeley and the Principles of Human Knowledge''</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Routledge]], 2001</span>
				<span class='text'>p</span>
				<span class='text'>27</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The phrase appears associated with him in authoritative philosophical sources, e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> &quot;Berkeley holds that there are no such mind-independent things, that, in the famous phrase, esse est percipi (aut percipere) – to be is to be perceived (or to perceive)</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Hence, human knowledge is reduced to two elements: that of spirits and of ideas (''Principles'' #86)</span>
				<span class='text'>In contrast to ideas, a spirit cannot be perceived</span>
				<span class='text'>A person's spirit, which perceives ideas, is to be comprehended intuitively by inward feeling or reflection (''Principles'' #89)</span>
				<span class='text'>For Berkeley, we have no direct 'idea' of spirits, albeit we have good reason to believe in the existence of other spirits, for their existence explains the purposeful regularities we find in experience</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Fogelin, Robert ''Berkeley and the Principles of Human Knowledge''</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Routledge]], 2001</span>
				<span class='text'>p</span>
				<span class='text'>74-75</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; (&quot;''It is plain that we cannot know the existence of other spirits otherwise than by their operations, or the ideas by them excited in us''&quot;, Dialogues #145)</span>
				<span class='text'>This is the solution that Berkeley offers to the [[problem of other minds]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally, the order and purposefulness of the whole of our experience of the world and especially of nature overwhelms us into believing in the existence of an extremely powerful and intelligent spirit that causes that order</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Berkeley, reflection on the attributes of that external spirit leads us to identify it with God</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus a material thing such as an apple consists of a collection of ideas (shape, color, taste, physical properties, etc</span>
				<span class='text'> which are caused in the spirits of humans by the spirit of God</span>
				<span class='text'>== Theology ===A convinced adherent of Christianity, Berkeley believed God to be present as an immediate [[causality|cause]] of all our experiences</span>
				<span class='text'>{quote|He did not evade the question of the external source of the diversity of the [[sense data]] at the disposal of the human individual</span>
				<span class='text'>He strove simply to show that the causes of sensations could not be things, because what we called things, and considered without grounds to be something different from our sensations, were built up wholly from sensations</span>
				<span class='text'>There must consequently be some other external source of the inexhaustible diversity of sensations</span>
				<span class='text'>The source of our sensations, Berkeley concluded, could only be God; He gave them to man, who had to see in them signs and symbols that carried God's word</span>

				<span class='text'>When in broad daylight I open my eyes, it is not in my power to choose whether I shall see or no, or to determine what particular objects shall present themselves to my view; and so likewise as to the hearing and other senses; the ideas imprinted on them are not creatures of my will</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Oizerman explained:{{quote|Berkeley's [[Subjective idealism|mystic idealism]] (as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] aptly christened it) claimed that nothing separated man and God (except [[materialism|materialist]] misconceptions, of course), since nature or matter did not exist as a reality independent of consciousness</span>
				<span class='text'>The revelation of God was directly accessible to man, according to this doctrine; it was the sense-perceived world, the world of man's sensations, which came to him from on high for him to decipher and so grasp the divine purpose</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;The Main Trends in Philosophy&quot;/&gt;}}Berkeley believed that God is not the distant engineer of [[Isaac Newton|Newtonian]] machinery that in the fullness of time led to the growth of a tree in the university quadrangle</span>
				<span class='text'>Rather, the perception of the tree is an idea that God's mind has produced in the mind, and the tree continues to exist in the quadrangle when &quot;nobody&quot; is there, simply because God is an infinite [[mind]] that perceives all</span>
				<span class='text'>he philosophy of [[David Hume]] concerning causality and objectivity is an elaboration of another aspect of Berkeley's philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>[[A</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Luce]], the most eminent Berkeley scholar of the 20th century, constantly stressed the continuity of Berkeley's philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>The fact that Berkeley returned to his major works throughout his life, issuing revised editions with only minor changes, also counts against any theory that attributes to him a significant [[volte-face]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}=== Relativity arguments ==={{See also|Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous}}John Locke (Berkeley's predecessor) states that we define an object by its [[Primary/secondary quality distinction|primary and secondary qualities]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He takes heat as an example of a secondary quality</span>
				<span class='text'>If you put one hand in a bucket of cold water, and the other hand in a bucket of warm water, then put both hands in a bucket of lukewarm water, one of your hands is going to tell you that the water is cold and the other that the water is hot</span>
				<span class='text'>Locke says that since two different objects (both your hands) perceive the water to be hot ''and'' cold, then the heat is not a quality of the water</span>
				<span class='text'>hile Locke used this argument to distinguish primary from secondary qualities, Berkeley extends it to cover primary qualities in the same way</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, he says that size is not a quality of an object because the size of the object depends on the distance between the observer and the object, or the size of the observer</span>
				<span class='text'>Since an object is a different size to different observers, then size is not a quality of the object</span>
				<span class='text'>Berkeley rejects shape with a similar argument and then asks: if neither primary qualities nor secondary qualities are of the object, then how can we say that there is anything more than the qualities we observe?=== New theory of vision ===In his ''Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision'', Berkeley frequently criticised the views of the Optic Writers, a title that seems to include [[William Molyneux|Molyneux]], Wallis, [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]] and [[René Descartes|Descartes]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, R, 1994</span>
				<span class='text'>Vision: Variations on some Berkeleian themes</span>
				<span class='text'>Oxford: Blackwell, p</span>
				<span class='text'>54</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In sections 1–51, Berkeley argued against the classical scholars of optics by holding that: ''spatial depth, as the distance that separates the perceiver from the perceived object is itself invisible''; namely, that space is perceived by experience instead of the senses ''per se''</span>
				<span class='text'>erkeley goes on to argue that visual cues, such as the perceived extension or 'confusion' of an object, can only be used to indirectly judge distance, because the viewer learns to associate visual cues with tactile sensations</span>
				<span class='text'>Berkeley gives the following analogy regarding indirect distance perception: one perceives distance indirectly just as one perceives a person's embarrassment indirectly</span>
				<span class='text'>When looking at an embarrassed person, we infer indirectly that the person is embarrassed by observing the red color on the person's face</span>
				<span class='text'>We know through experience that a red face tends to signal embarrassment, as we've learned to associate the two</span>
				<span class='text'>he question concerning the visibility of space was central to the Renaissance [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] tradition and its reliance on classical optics in the development of pictorial representations of spatial depth</span>
				<span class='text'> This matter was debated by scholars since the 11th-century Arab polymath and mathematician [[Alhazen]] (al-Hasan Ibn al-Haytham) affirmed in experimental contexts the visibility of space</span>
				<span class='text'> This issue, which was raised in Berkeley's theory of vision, was treated at length in the ''Phenomenology of Perception'' of Maurice [[Merleau-Ponty]], in the context of confirming the visual perception of spatial depth (''la profondeur''), and by way of refuting Berkeley's thesis</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; It is worth quoting Berkeley's words on this issue (Section 53):&lt;blockquote&gt;What inclines men to this mistake (beside the humour of making one see by geometry) is, that the same perceptions or ideas which suggest distance, do also suggest magnitude</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>I say they do not first suggest distance, and then leave it to the judgement to use that as a medium, whereby to collect the magnitude; but they have as close and immediate a connexion with the magnitude as with the distance; and suggest magnitude as independently of distance, as they do distance independently of magnitude</span>

				<span class='text'>''The Analyst'' represented a direct attack on the foundations and principles of [[calculus]] and, in particular, the notion of [[Method of Fluxions|fluxion]] or [[infinitesimal]] change, which Newton and [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] used to develop the calculus</span>
				<span class='text'> Berkeley coined the phrase [[ghosts of departed quantities]], familiar to students of calculus</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]]'s book [[From Here to Infinity (book)|From Here to Infinity]], (chapter 6), captures the gist of his criticism</span>
				<span class='text'>erkeley regarded his criticism of calculus as part of his broader campaign against the religious implications of Newtonian mechanics{{spaced ndash}}as a defence of traditional Christianity against [[deism]], which tends to distance God from His worshipers</span>
				<span class='text'>Specifically, he observed that both Newtonian and Leibnizian calculus employed infinitesimals sometimes as positive, nonzero quantities and other times as a number explicitly equal to zero</span>
				<span class='text'>Berkeley's key point in &quot;The Analyst&quot; was that Newton's calculus (and the laws of motion based in calculus) lacked rigorous theoretical foundations</span>
				<span class='text'>He claimed that&lt;blockquote&gt;In every other Science Men prove their Conclusions by their Principles, and not their Principles by the Conclusions</span>
				<span class='text'>But if in yours you should allow your selves this unnatural way of proceeding, the Consequence would be that you must take up with Induction, and bid adieu to Demonstration</span>

				<span class='text'>= Commemoration ==The [[University of California, Berkeley]] was named after him, although the pronunciation has evolved to suit [[American English]]: ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ər|k|l|iː}} {{respell|BURK|lee}})</span>
				<span class='text'>The naming was suggested in 1866 by Frederick Billings, a trustee of the then [[College of California]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Billings was inspired by Berkeley's ''Verses on the Prospect of Planting Arts and Learning in America'', particularly the final stanza: &quot;Westward the course of empire takes its way; The first four Acts already past, A fifth shall close the Drama with the day; Time's noblest offspring is the last</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;On 18 April 1735, The Town of Berkley, in Bristol County Massachusetts, was founded and named after him</span>
				<span class='text'>Located 40 miles south of Boston and 25 miles north of Middletown Rhode Island where Berkeley lived at his farmhouse &quot;Whitehall&quot; </span>
				<span class='text'>Whitehall Museum House is the farmhouse modified by Dean George Berkeley, when he lived in the northern section of Newport, Rhode Island that comprises present-day Middletown, Rhode Island in 1729–31, while working to open his planned St Paul's College on Bermuda</span>
				<span class='text'>It is also known as Berkeley House or Bishop George Berkeley House and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970</span>
				<span class='text'>1]A [[Berkeley College (Yale)|residential college]] and an [[Berkeley Divinity School|Episcopal seminary]] at [[Yale University]] also bear Berkeley's name, as does the [[Trinity College Library, Dublin|Berkeley Library]] at [[Trinity College, Dublin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Also named for him is Berkeley Preparatory School in Tampa, Florida</span>
				<span class='text'> This leading private school is affiliated with the Episcopal Church, has almost 1300 students from pre-kindergarten through twelfth grade, and was founded in 1960</span>
				<span class='text'>n Ulster History Circle blue plaque commemorating him is located in Bishop Street Within, city of Derry</span>
