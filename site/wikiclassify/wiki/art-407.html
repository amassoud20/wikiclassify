				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Miller, 50&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, Hawthorne looked back at his time in Maine fondly: &quot;Those were delightful days, for that part of the country was wild then, with only scattered clearings, and nine tenths of it primeval woods</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mellow, 21&lt;/ref&gt; In 1819, he was sent back to Salem for school and soon complained of homesickness and being too far from his mother and sisters</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Mellow, 22&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of his homesickness, for the sake of having fun, he distributed seven issues of ''The Spectator'' to his family in August and September 1820</span>
				<span class='text'>The homemade newspaper was written by hand</span>
				<span class='text'>It included essays, poems, and news utilizing the young author's developing adolescent humor</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He contributed short stories, including &quot;[[Young Goodman Brown]]&quot; and &quot;[[The Minister's Black Veil]]&quot;, to various magazines and annuals, though none drew major attention to the author</span>

				<span class='text'>Seeking a possible home for himself and Sophia, he joined the [[transcendentalist]] [[Utopia]]n community at [[Brook Farm (Boston, Massachusetts)|Brook Farm]] in 1841 not because he agreed with the experiment but because it helped him save money to marry Sophia</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McFarland, 83&lt;/ref&gt; He paid a $1,000 deposit and was put in charge of shoveling the hill of manure referred to as &quot;the Gold Mine&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cheever, 104&lt;/ref&gt; He left later that year, though his Brook Farm adventure would prove an inspiration for his novel ''[[The Blithedale Romance]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>A local teenager named Martha Hunt had drowned herself in the river and Hawthorne's boat, ''Pond Lily'', was needed to find her body</span>

				<span class='text'> She was the very image of death-agony&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Their first, a daughter, was born March 3, 1844</span>
				<span class='text'>She was named Una, a reference to ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', to the displeasure of family members</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McFarland, 97&lt;/ref&gt; Hawthorne wrote to a friend, &quot;I find it a very sober and serious kind of happiness that springs from the birth of a child</span>

				<span class='text'>Hawthorne wrote to his sister Louisa on June 22, 1846, with the news: &quot;A small troglodyte made his appearance here at ten minutes to six o'clock this morning, who claimed to be your nephew</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mellow, 273&lt;/ref&gt; Their final child, [[Mother Mary Alphonsa|Rose]], was born in May 1851</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|200px|[[Daguerrotype]] of Hawthorne, [[John Adams Whipple|Whipple &amp; Black]], 1848]]In April 1846, Hawthorne was officially appointed as the &quot;Surveyor for the District of Salem and Beverly and Inspector of the Revenue for the Port of Salem&quot; at an annual salary of $1,200</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Miller, 242&lt;/ref&gt; He had difficulty writing during this period, as he admitted to Longfellow: &lt;blockquote&gt;I am trying to resume my pen</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Miller, 265&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Like his earlier appointment to the custom house in Boston, this employment was vulnerable to the politics of the [[spoils system]]</span>
				<span class='text'>A Democrat, Hawthorne lost this job due to the change of administration in Washington after the presidential election of 1848</span>
				<span class='text'>Hawthorne wrote a letter of protest to the ''Boston Daily Advertiser'', which was attacked by the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]] and supported by the Democrats, making Hawthorne's dismissal a much-talked about event in New England</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cheever, 179&lt;/ref&gt; Hawthorne was deeply affected by the death of his mother shortly thereafter in late July, calling it, &quot;the darkest hour I ever lived&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cheever, 180&lt;/ref&gt; Hawthorne was appointed the corresponding secretary of the Salem Lyceum in 1848</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Miller, 264–265&lt;/ref&gt;Hawthorne returned to writing and published ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'' in mid-March 1850,&lt;ref&gt;Miller, 300&lt;/ref&gt; including a preface that refers to his three-year tenure in the Custom House and makes several allusions to local politicians, who did not appreciate their treatment</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Mellow, 316&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first mass-produced books in America, it sold 2,500 volumes within ten days and earned Hawthorne $1,500 over 14 years</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=McFarland136/&gt; One of Hawthorne's friends, the critic [[Edwin Percy Whipple]], objected to the novel's &quot;morbid intensity&quot; and its dense psychological details, writing that the book &quot;is therefore apt to become, like Hawthorne, too painfully anatomical in his exhibition of them&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Miller, 301–302&lt;/ref&gt; though 20th-century writer [[D</span>
				<span class='text'>H</span>
				<span class='text'>Lawrence]] said that there could be no more perfect work of the American imagination than ''The Scarlet Letter''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Miller, 284&lt;/ref&gt;Hawthorne and his family moved to a small red farmhouse near [[Lenox, Massachusetts]] at the end of March 1850</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Miller, 274&lt;/ref&gt; Hawthorne became friends with [[Herman Melville]] beginning on August 5, 1850, when the authors met at a picnic hosted by a mutual friend</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cheever, 96&lt;/ref&gt; Melville had just read Hawthorne's short story collection ''[[Mosses from an Old Manse]]'', and his unsigned review of the collection, titled &quot;Hawthorne and His Mosses&quot;, was printed in ''[[The Literary World (magazine)|The Literary World]]'' on August 17 and August 24</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Miller, 312&lt;/ref&gt; Melville, who was composing ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' at the time, wrote that these stories revealed a dark side to Hawthorne, &quot;shrouded in blackness, ten times black&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Mellow, 335&lt;/ref&gt; Melville dedicated ''Moby-Dick'' (1851) to Hawthorne: &quot;In token of my admiration for his genius, this book is inscribed to Nathaniel Hawthorne</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McFarland, 182&lt;/ref&gt; That year Hawthorne wrote the campaign biography of his friend Franklin Pierce, depicting him as &quot;a man of peaceful pursuits&quot; in the book, which he titled ''The Life of Franklin Pierce''</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Miller, 382–383&lt;/ref&gt; With Pierce's election as President, Hawthorne was rewarded in 1853 with the position of United States [[consul (representative)|consul]] in [[Consulate of the United States in Liverpool|Liverpool]] shortly after the publication of ''[[Tanglewood Tales]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McFarland, 186&lt;/ref&gt; The role, considered the most lucrative foreign service position at the time, was described by Hawthorne's wife as &quot;second in dignity to the Embassy in London&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Detroit: Thompson Gale, 2002: 319</span>
				<span class='text'>ISBN 0-7876-6517-7&lt;/ref&gt;Hawthorne was predominantly a short story writer in his early career</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon publishing ''Twice-Told Tales'', however, he noted, &quot;I do not think much of them,&quot; and he expected little response from the public</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Miller, 104&lt;/ref&gt; His four major [[Romance novel|romances]] were written between 1850 and 1860: ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'' (1850), ''[[The House of the Seven Gables (novel)|The House of the Seven Gables]]'' (1851), ''[[The Blithedale Romance]]'' (1852) and ''[[The Marble Faun]]'' (1860)</span>
				<span class='text'>Another novel-length romance, ''[[Fanshawe (novel)|Fanshawe]]'' was published anonymously in 1828</span>
				<span class='text'>Hawthorne defined a romance as being radically different from a novel by not being concerned with the possible or probable course of ordinary experience</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Porte, 95&lt;/ref&gt; In the preface to ''The House of the Seven Gables'', Hawthorne describes his romance-writing as using &quot;atmospherical medium as to bring out or mellow the lights and deepen and enrich the shadows of the picture&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wineapple, 237&lt;/ref&gt;Feminists and historicists have in recent years revalued Hawthorne's thematic depictions of women as figurations of transformative potential</span>
				<span class='text'>These scholars are interested particularly in stalwart Hester Prynne, in her own forward-looking words the &quot;destined prophetess, </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>angel and apostle of the coming revelation&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Camille Paglia]] saw Hester as mystical, &quot;a wandering goddess still bearing the mark of her Asiatic origins </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>moving serenely in the magic circle of her sexual nature&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Paglia, ''Sexual Personae'', 581, 583&lt;/ref&gt; Lauren Berlant termed take-charge but caring Hester &quot;the citizen as woman [personifying] love as a quality of the body that contains the purest light of nature,&quot; her resulting &quot;traitorous political theory&quot; a &quot;Female Symbolic&quot; literalization of futile Puritan metaphors</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Berlant, ''The Anatomy of National Fantasy'', 94, 148, 175&lt;/ref&gt; Historicists view Hester as a protofeminist and avatar of the self-reliance and responsibility that led to women's suffrage and reproductive emancipation</span>
				<span class='text'>Anthony Splendora found her likely literary genealogy among other archetypally fallen but redeemed women, both historic and mythic, who stood up for their meritorious rights: to wit, Psyche of ancient legend, Heloise of twelfth-century France's tragedy involving world-renowned philosopher Peter Abelard, Anne Hutchinson (America's first heretic, circa 1636), and Hawthorne family friend Margaret Fuller</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Splendora, &quot;Psyche and Hester&quot;, 2, 5, 18&lt;/ref&gt; In Hester's first ''Scarlet Letter'' appearance, Hawthorne likens her, &quot;infant at her bosom&quot;, to Mary, Mother of Jesus, &quot;the image of Divine Maternity&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Her potentiality as agency of transformation is thus immediate and specific</span>
				<span class='text'>In her study of Victorian literature, in which such &quot;galvanic outcasts&quot; as Hester feature prominently, Nina Auerbach went so far as to name Hester's fall and subsequent redemption &quot;the novel's one unequivocally religious activity&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Auerbach, ''Woman and the Demon'', 150, 166&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding Hester as a deity figure, Meredith A</span>
				<span class='text'>Powers found in Hester's characterization &quot;the earliest in American fiction that the archetypal Goddess appears quite graphically,&quot; like a Goddess &quot;not the wife of traditional marriage, permanently subject to a male overlord&quot;; Powers noted &quot;her syncretism, her flexibility, her inherent ability to alter and so avoid the defeat of secondary status in a goal-oriented civilization&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Powers, ''The Heroine in Western Literature,''  144&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from Hester Prynne, the cynosural women of Hawthorne's other novels — from Ellen Langton of ''Fanshawe'' to Zenobia and Priscilla of ''The Blithedale Romance,'' Hilda and Miriam of ''The Marble Faun'' and Phoebe and Hepzibah of ''The House of the Seven Gables'' — are more fully realized than his male characters, who merely orbit them</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Splendora, &quot;Psyche and Hester&quot;, 12&lt;/ref&gt; This observation is equally true of his short-story protagonistas, central females who serve as unambiguous allegorical foci: Rappaccini's beautiful but life-altering, garden-bound, Eve-like daughter; provocatively almost-perfect Georgiana of &quot;The Birthmark&quot;; the unpardonably sinned-against (abandoned) Ester of &quot;Ethan Brand&quot;; and goodwife Faith Brown, linchpin of Young Goodman Brown's very belief in God</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;My Faith is gone!&quot; Brown exclaims in despair upon seeing his wife at the Witches' Sabbath</span>
				<span class='text'>Hawthorne could not have been more explicit in illuminating his view of the significance of, and his hopeful sympathies with, women</span>
				<span class='text'>awthorne also wrote nonfiction</span>
				<span class='text'>In 2008, [[The Library of America]] selected Hawthorne's &quot;A Collection of Wax Figures&quot; for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of American True Crime</span>
				<span class='text'>==Criticism===[[Edgar Allan Poe]] wrote important and somewhat unflattering reviews of both ''Twice-Told Tales'' and ''Mosses from an Old Manse''</span>
				<span class='text'>Poe's negative assessment was partly due to his own contempt of allegory and moral tales, and his chronic accusations of plagiarism, though he admitted, &lt;blockquote&gt;The style of Hawthorne is purity itself</span>
				<span class='text'>His tone is singularly effective—wild, plaintive, thoughtful, and in full accordance with his themes</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>We look upon him as one of the few men of indisputable genius to whom our country has as yet given birth</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McFarland, 88–89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] wrote, &quot;Nathaniel Hawthorne's reputation as a writer is a very pleasing fact, because his writing is not good for anything, and this is a tribute to the man</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry James]] praised Hawthorne, saying, &quot;The fine thing in Hawthorne is that he cared for the deeper psychology, and that, in his way, he tried to become familiar with it</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Porte, 97&lt;/ref&gt; Poet [[John Greenleaf Whittier]] wrote that he admired the &quot;weird and subtle beauty&quot; in Hawthorne's tales</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; [[Evert Augustus Duyckinck]] said of Hawthorne, &quot;Of the American writers destined to live, he is the most original, the one least indebted to foreign models or literary precedents of any kind</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;McFarland, 88&lt;/ref&gt;Contemporary response to Hawthorne's work praised his sentimentality and moral purity while more modern evaluations focus on the dark psychological complexity</span>
