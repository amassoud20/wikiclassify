				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; was an Italian [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] composer of [[religious music|sacred music]] and the best-known 16th-century representative of the [[Roman School]] of musical composition</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Roche&gt;Jerome Roche, ''Palestrina'' (Oxford Studies of Composers, 7; New York: Oxford University Press, 1971), ISBN 0-19-314117-5</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He had a lasting influence on the development of church music, and his work has often been seen as the culmination of Renaissance [[polyphony]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Roche/&gt;==Biography==Palestrina was born in the town of [[Palestrina]], near [[Rome]], then part of the [[Papal States]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Documents suggest that he first visited Rome in 1537, when he is listed as a chorister at the [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore|Santa Maria Maggiore]] basilica</span>
				<span class='text'>He studied with [[Robin Mallapert]] and [[Firmin Lebel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He spent most of his career in the city</span>
				<span class='text'>alestrina came of age as a musician under the influence of the northern European style of polyphony, which owed its dominance in Italy primarily to two influential [[Netherlandish]] composers, [[Guillaume Dufay]] and [[Josquin des Prez]], who had spent significant portions of their careers there</span>
				<span class='text'>Italy itself had yet to produce anyone of comparable fame or skill in polyphony</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Roche/&gt;From 1544 to 1551, Palestrina was organist of the cathedral of St</span>
				<span class='text'>Agapito, the principal church of his native city</span>
				<span class='text'>His first published compositions, a book of [[Mass (music)|Masses]], had made so favorable an impression with [[Pope Julius III]] (previously the [[Bishop of Palestrina]]) that in 1551 he appointed Palestrina ''maestro di cappella'' or musical director of the [[Cappella Giulia]], (Julian Chapel, in the sense of choir), the choir of the chapter of canons at [[St</span>
				<span class='text'>Peter's Basilica]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This book of Masses was the first by a native composer, since in the Italian states of Palestrina's day, most composers of sacred music were from the [[Low Countries]], France, Portugal,&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Mendes, António Carreira, Duarte Lobo, Filipe de Magalhães, Fr</span>
				<span class='text'>Manuel Cardoso, João Lourenço and Pero do Porto, among many others</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; or Spain</span>
				<span class='text'>In fact the book was modeled on one by [[Cristóbal de Morales]]: the woodcut in the front is almost an exact copy of the one from the book by the Spanish composer</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Facade San Giovanni in Laterano 2006-09-07</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Facade of [[Basilica of St</span>
				<span class='text'>John Lateran|St John Lateran]], Rome, where Palestrina was musical director]]During the next decade, Palestrina held positions similar to his Julian Chapel appointment at other chapels and churches in Rome, notably [[Basilica of St</span>
				<span class='text'>John Lateran|St John Lateran]] (1555–1560, a post previously held by [[Lassus]]), and St Mary Major (1561–1566)</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1571 he returned to the Julian Chapel and remained at St Peter's for the rest of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>The decade of the 1570s was difficult for him personally: he lost his brother, two of his sons, and his wife in three separate outbreaks of the plague (1572, 1575, and 1580, respectively)</span>
				<span class='text'>He seems to have considered becoming a priest at this time, but instead he remarried, this time to a wealthy widow</span>
				<span class='text'>This finally gave him financial independence (he was not well paid as choirmaster) and he was able to compose prolifically until his death</span>
				<span class='text'>e died in Rome of [[pleurisy]] in 1594</span>
				<span class='text'>As was usual, Palestrina was buried on the same day he died, in a plain coffin with a lead plate on which was inscribed ''Libera me Domine''</span>
				<span class='text'>A five-part psalm for three choirs was sung at the funeral</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Pyne&gt;Zoe Kendrick Pyne, ''Giovanni Pierluigi di Palestrina: His Life and Times'' (London: Bodley Head, 1922)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Music=={{See also|List of compositions by Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Counterpoint}}Palestrina left hundreds of compositions, including 105 [[mass (music)|masses]], 68 [[offertory|offertories]], at least 140 [[Madrigal (music)|madrigals]] and more than 300 [[motet]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, there are at least 72 [[hymn]]s, 35 [[magnificat]]s, 11 [[litany|litanies]], and four or five sets of [[Lamentations (music)|lamentations]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Roche/&gt; The ''Gloria'' melody from a Palestrina magnificat is widely used today in the resurrection hymn tune, ''Victory'' (The Strife Is O'er)</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Roche/&gt; He published just two collections of madrigals with profane texts, one in 1555 and another in 1586</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Roche/&gt; The other two collections were spiritual madrigals, a genre beloved by the proponents of the Counter-Reformation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Roche/&gt;Palestrina's masses show how his compositional style developed over time</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Roche/&gt; His ''Missa sine nomine'' seems to have been particularly attractive to [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], who studied and performed it while writing the [[Mass in B minor]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Wolff&gt;Christoph Wolff, ''Der Stile Antico in der Musik Johann Sebastian Bachs: Studien zu Bachs Spätwerk'' (Wiesbaden: Franz Steiner Verlag, 1968), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>224–225</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Most of Palestrina's masses appeared in thirteen volumes printed between 1554 and 1601, the last seven published after his death</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Roche/&gt;&lt;ref name=Garrat&gt;James Garrat, ''Palestrina and the German Romantic Imagination'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2002)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;One of his most important works, the ''[[Missa Papae Marcelli]]'' (Pope Marcellus Mass), has been historically associated with erroneous information involving the Council of Trent</span>
				<span class='text'> According to this tale (which forms the basis of [[Hans Pfitzner]]'s opera [[Palestrina (opera)|''Palestrina'']]), it was composed in order to persuade the [[Council of Trent]] that a draconian ban on the [[polyphony|polyphonic]] treatment of text in sacred music (as opposed, that is, to a more directly intelligible homophonic treatment) was unnecessary</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Bokina&gt;John Bokina, ''Opera and Politics'' (New York: Yale University Press, 1997), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>129–131</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; However, more recent scholarship shows that this mass was in fact composed before the cardinals convened to discuss the ban (possibly as much as ten years before)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Bokina/&gt; Historical data indicates that the Council of Trent, as an official body, never actually banned any church music and failed to make any ruling or official statement on the subject</span>
				<span class='text'> These stories originated from the unofficial points-of-view of some Council attendees who discussed their ideas with those not privy to the Council's deliberations</span>
				<span class='text'>Those opinions and rumors have, over centuries, been transmuted into fictional accounts, put into print, and often incorrectly taught as historical fact</span>
				<span class='text'>While Palestrina's compositional motivations are not known, he may have been quite conscious of the need for intelligible text; however, this was not to conform with any doctrine of the [[Counter-Reformation]],&lt;ref name=Bokina/&gt; because no such doctrine exists</span>
				<span class='text'> His characteristic style remained consistent from the 1560s until the end of his life</span>
				<span class='text'> Roche's hypothesis that Palestrina's seemingly dispassionate approach to expressive or emotive texts could have resulted from his having to produce many to order, or from a deliberate decision that any intensity of expression was unbecoming in church music,&lt;ref name=Roche/&gt; reflects modern expectations about expressive freedom and underestimates the extent to which the mood of Palestrina's settings is adapted to the liturgical occasions for which the texts were set, rather than the line-by-line meaning, particularly by the use of the church [[Gregorian mode|modes]] and the disposition of voices</span>
				<span class='text'>Performing editions and recordings of Palestrina have tended to favour his works in the more familiar modes and standard (SATB) voicings, under-representing the expressive variety of his settings</span>
				<span class='text'>=The 'Palestrina style'==One of the hallmarks of Palestrina's music is that dissonances are typically relegated to the &quot;weak&quot; beats in a measure</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Jeppesen&gt;Knud Jeppesen, ''Counterpoint: The Polyphonic Vocal Style of the Sixteenth Century'', trans</span>
				<span class='text'>Glen Haydon (with a new foreword by Alfred Mann; New York: Prentice-Hall, 1939, repr</span>
				<span class='text'>New York: Dover, 1992)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This produced a smoother and more consonant type of [[polyphony]] which is now considered to be definitive of late Renaissance music, given Palestrina's position as Europe's leading composer (along with [[Lassus]]) in the wake of [[Josquin]] (d</span>
				<span class='text'>1521)</span>
				<span class='text'>The &quot;Palestrina style&quot; now serves as a basis for college Renaissance [[counterpoint]] classes, thanks in large part to the efforts of the 18th-century composer and theorist [[Johann Joseph Fux]], who, in a book called ''[[Gradus ad Parnassum]]'' (Steps to Parnassus, 1725), set about codifying Palestrina's techniques as a pedagogical tool for students of composition</span>
				<span class='text'>Fux applied the term &quot;[[species counterpoint]]&quot;, which entails a series of steps whereby students work out progressively more elaborate combinations of voices while adhering to certain strict rules</span>
				<span class='text'>Fux did make a number of stylistic errors, however, which have been corrected by later authors (notably [[Knud Jeppesen]] and Morris)</span>
				<span class='text'>Palestrina's own music contains ample instances in which his rules have been followed to the letter, as well as many where they are freely broken</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to Fux, Palestrina had established and followed these basic guidelines:* The flow of music is dynamic, not rigid or static</span>
				<span class='text'> Melody should contain few leaps between notes</span>
				<span class='text'>(Jeppesen: &quot;The line is the starting point of Palestrina's style</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;)&lt;ref name=Jeppesen/&gt;* If a leap occurs, it must be small and immediately countered by stepwise motion in the opposite direction</span>
				<span class='text'> Dissonances are to be confined to passing notes and weak beats</span>
				<span class='text'>If one falls on a strong beat, it is to be immediately resolved</span>
				<span class='text'>=Reputation==Palestrina was famous in his day, and if anything his reputation increased after his death</span>
				<span class='text'>Conservative music of the Roman school continued to be written in his style (which in the 17th century came to be known as the ''[[prima pratica]]'') by such students of his as [[Giovanni Maria Nanino]], [[Ruggiero Giovanelli]], [[Arcangelo Crivelli]], [[Teofilo Gargari]], [[Francesco Soriano]] and [[Gregorio Allegri]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It is also thought that [[Salvatore Sacco]] may have been a student of Palestrina, as well as [[Giovanni Dragoni]], who later went on to become choirmaster in the church of [[S</span>
				<span class='text'>Giovanni in Laterano]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Pyne/&gt; As late as the 1750s, Palestrina's style was still the reference for composers working in the motet form, as can be seen by [[Francesco Barsanti]]'s ''Sei Antifones'' 'in the style of Palestrina' (c</span>
				<span class='text'>1750; published by [Peter] Welcker, c</span>
				<span class='text'>1762)</span>
				<span class='text'>uch research on Palestrina was done in the 19th century by [[Giuseppe Baini]], who published a monograph in 1828 which made Palestrina famous again and reinforced the already existing legend that he was the &quot;Saviour of Church Music&quot; during the reforms of the [[Council of Trent]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Garrat/&gt; The 19th century proclivity for hero-worship is predominant in this monograph, however, and this has remained with the composer to some degree to the present day</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Hans Pfitzner]]'s opera ''[[Palestrina (opera)|Palestrina]]'' shows this attitude at its peak</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Garrat/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bokina/&gt;It is only recently, with the discovery and publication of a great deal of hitherto unknown or forgotten music by various Renaissance composers, that it has been possible to properly assess Palestrina in a historical context</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Roche/&gt; Though Palestrina represents late Renaissance music well, others such as [[Orlande de Lassus]] (a Franco-Flemish composer who also spent some of his early career in Italy) and [[William Byrd]] were arguably more versatile</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Roche/&gt; 20th and 21st century scholarship by and large retains the view that Palestrina was a strong and refined composer whose music represents a summit of technical perfection, while emphasizing that some of his contemporaries possessed equally individual voices even within the confines of &quot;smooth polyphony</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; As a result, composers like Lassus and Byrd as well as [[Tomas Luis de Victoria]] have increasingly come to enjoy comparable reputations</span>
				<span class='text'>here are two comprehensive editions of Palestrina's works: a 33-volume edition published by Breitkopf and Härtel, in Leipzig Germany between 1862 and 1894 edited by [[Franz Xaver Haberl]], and a 34-volume edition published in the mid twentieth century, by Fratelli Scalera, in Rome, Italy edited by [[w:it:Raffaele Casimiri|R</span>
