				<span class='text'>Vercingetorix came to power after his formal designation as chieftain of the Arverni at the [[oppidum]] [[Bibracte]] in 52 BC</span>

				<span class='text'>]Having been appointed [[Roman governor|governor]] of the Roman province of [[Gallia Narbonensis]] (modern [[Provence]]) in 58 BC, [[Julius Caesar]] proceeded to conquer the [[Gauls|Gallic]] tribes beyond over the next few years, maintaining control through a careful [[divide and rule]] strategy</span>
				<span class='text'>He made use of the [[Political faction|factionalism]] among the Gallic elites, favoring certain noblemen over others with political support and Roman luxuries such as [[wine]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Attempts at revolt, such as that of [[Ambiorix]] in 54 BC, had secured only local support, but Vercingetorix, whose father, Celtillus, had been put to death by his own countrymen for seeking to rule all of Gaul, managed to unify the Gallic tribes against the Romans and adopted more current styles of warfare</span>
				<span class='text'>he revolt that Vercingetorix came to lead began in early 52 BC while Caesar was raising troops in [[Cisalpine Gaul]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Believing that Caesar would be distracted by the turmoil in [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] following the death of [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]], the [[Carnutes]], under Cotuatus and Conetodunus, made the first move, slaughtering the Romans who had settled in their territory</span>
				<span class='text'>ercingetorix, a young nobleman of the Arvernian city of [[Gergovia]], roused his dependents to join the revolt, but he and his followers were expelled by the nobles of the city, including Vercingetorix's uncle Gobanitio, because they thought opposing Caesar was too great a risk</span>
				<span class='text'>Undeterred, Vercingetorix raised an army of the poor, took Gergovia and was hailed as king</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Julius Caesar, ''Commentaries on the Gallic War'' Book VII, sect</span>
				<span class='text'>4</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He made alliances with other tribes, and having been unanimously given supreme command of their armies, imposed his authority through harsh discipline and the taking of hostages</span>
				<span class='text'>He adopted the policy of retreating to natural [[fortification]]s, and undertook an early example of a [[scorched earth]] strategy by burning towns to prevent the [[Roman legion]]s from living off the land</span>
				<span class='text'>ercingetorix scorched much of the land marching north with his army from Gergovia in an attempt to deprive Caesar of the resources and safe haven of the towns and villages along Caesar's march south</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the capital of the [[Bituriges]], Avaricum ([[Bourges]]), a Gallic settlement straight in Caesar's path, was spared</span>
				<span class='text'>Due to the town's strong protests, naturally defendable terrain, and apparently strong man-made reinforcing defenses, Vercingetorix decided against razing and burning it</span>
				<span class='text'>Leaving the town to its fate, Vercingetorix camped well outside of Avaricum and focused on conducting harassing engagements of the advancing Roman units led by Caesar and his chief lieutenant [[Titus Labienus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon reaching Avaricum however, the Romans laid siege and eventually captured the capital</span>
				<span class='text'>Afterwards, in a contemptuous reprisal for 25 days of hunger and of laboring over the siegeworks required to breach Avaricum's defenses, the Romans slaughtered nearly the entire population of ~40,000 leaving only ~800 alive</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Julius Caesar, Commentaries on the Gallic War vii</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The next major battle was at [[Battle of Gergovia|Gergovia]], where Vercingetorix tactically defeated Caesar, inflicting heavy losses</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the victory cost Vercingetorix many men, including many noblemen</span>
				<span class='text'>Because of these losses he retreated and moved to another stronghold, [[Alesia (city)|Alesia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==Battle of Alesia===In the [[Battle of Alesia]] (September, 52 BC), Caesar built a [[fortification]] around the city to besiege it</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Caesar's army was surrounded by the rest of Gaul, and Vercingetorix had summoned his Gallic allies to attack the besieging Romans, so Caesar built another outer fortification against the expected relief armies (resulting in a doughnut-shaped fortification)</span>
				<span class='text'>The relief came in insufficient numbers: estimates range from 80,000 to 250,000 soldiers</span>
				<span class='text'>Vercingetorix, the [[Military tactics|tactic]]al leader, was cut off from them on the inside, and without his guidance the attacks were initially unsuccessful</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the attacks did reveal a weak point in the fortifications and the combined forces on the inside and the outside almost made a breakthrough</span>
				<span class='text'>Only when Caesar personally led the last reserves into battle did he finally manage to prevail</span>
				<span class='text'>This was a decisive battle in the creation of the [[Roman Empire]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to [[Plutarch]], Vercingetorix surrendered in dramatic fashion, riding his beautifully adorned horse out of Alesia and around Caesar's camp before dismounting in front of Caesar, stripping himself of his armor and sitting down at his opponent's feet, where he remained motionless until he was taken away</span>
