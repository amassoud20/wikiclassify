				<span class='text'>On 10 November 1509, Pizarro sailed from Spain to the New World with [[Alonzo de Ojeda]] on an expedition to Urabí</span>
				<span class='text'>He sailed to [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]] and joined the fleet of [[Martín Fernández de Enciso]], and, in 1513, accompanied [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa|Balboa]] to the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=CE/&gt; In 1514, he found a supporter in [[Pedro Arias de Avila|Pedrarias Dávila]], the Governor of [[Castilla de Oro]], and was rewarded for his role in the arrest of Balboa with the positions of mayor and magistrate in [[Panama City]], serving from 1519 to 1523</span>
				<span class='text'>eports of [[Peru]]'s riches and Cortés's success in Mexico tantalized Pizarro and he undertook two expeditions to conquer the Incan Empire in 1524 and in 1526</span>
				<span class='text'>Both failed as a result of native hostilities, bad weather, and lack of provisions</span>
				<span class='text'> [[Pedro de los Ríos]], the Governor of Panama, made an effort to recall Pizarro, but the ''conquistador'' resisted and remained in the south</span>
				<span class='text'>In April 1528, he reached northern Peru and found the natives rich with precious metals</span>
				<span class='text'>This discovery gave Pizarro the motivation to plan a third expedition to conquer Peru, and he returned to Panama to make arrangements, but the Governor refused to grant permission for the project</span>
				<span class='text'>Pizarro returned to Spain to appeal directly to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|King Charles I]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His plea was successful, and he received not only a license for the proposed expedition, but also considerable authority over any lands conquered during the venture</span>
				<span class='text'>He was joined by family and friends, and the expedition left Panama in 1530</span>
				<span class='text'>hen hostile natives along the coast threatened the expedition, Pizarro moved inland and founded the first Spanish settlement in Peru, [[San Miguel de Piura]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Inca]] [[Atahualpa]] refused to tolerate a Spanish presence in his lands, but was captured by Pizarro during the [[Battle of Cajamarca]] on 16 November 1532</span>
				<span class='text'>A ransom for the emperor's release was demanded and Atahualpa filled a room with gold, but Pizarro charged him with various crimes and executed Atahualpa on 26 July 1533, much to the opposition of his associates, who thought the conquistador was overstepping his authority</span>
				<span class='text'>The same year, Pizarro entered the Incan capital of [[Cuzco]], and the conquest of Peru was complete</span>
				<span class='text'>In January 1535, Pizarro founded the city of [[Lima, Peru|Lima]], a project he considered his greatest achievement</span>
				<span class='text'>Quarrels between Pizarro and his longtime comrade-in-arms [[Diego Almagro]] culminated in the [[Battle of Las Salinas]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Almagro was captured and executed, and, on 26 June 1541, his embittered son assassinated Pizarro in Lima</span>
				<span class='text'>The conqueror of Peru was laid to rest in the [[Lima Cathedral]]</span>
				<span class='text'>= Early life ==Pizarro was born in [[Trujillo, Cáceres|Trujillo]], in modern day [[Extremadura]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His birth year is uncertain, but is placed sometime in the 1470s</span>
				<span class='text'>He was the  [[illegitimate]] son of Gonzalo Pizarro Rodríguez de Aguilar (1446–1522) and Francisca González Mateos, a poor woman of Trujillo</span>
				<span class='text'>His father was a [[colonel]] of [[infantry]] who served in [[Navarre]] and in the [[Italian Wars|Italian campaigns]] under [[Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba|Córdoba]]</span>

				<span class='text'>During the next five years, Pizarro became a close associate of Dávila and the governor assigned him a ''[[repartimiento]]'' of natives and cattle</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Prescott/&gt;{{rp|93}} When Dávila decided to get rid of Balboa out of distrust, he instructed Pizarro to personally arrest him and bring him to stand trial</span>
				<span class='text'>Balboa was beheaded in January 1519</span>
				<span class='text'>For his loyalty to Dávila, Pizarro was rewarded with the positions of mayor ([[Alcalde]]) and magistrate of the then recently founded [[Panama City]] from 1519 to 1523</span>
				<span class='text'>=Expeditions to South America=={{Spanish colonization of the Americas}}The first attempt to explore western [[South America]] was undertaken in 1522 by [[Pascual de Andagoya]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The native South Americans he encountered told him about a gold-rich territory called Virú, which was on a river called Pirú (later corrupted to Perú) and was from where they came</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Hemming/&gt;{{rp|24}} These reports were related by the Spanish-Inca ''[[mestizo]]'' writer [[Inca Garcilaso de la Vega|Garcilaso de la Vega]] in his famous ''Comentarios Reales de los Incas'' (1609)</span>
				<span class='text'>ndagoya eventually established contact with several Native American ''curacas'' (chiefs), some of whom he later claimed were sorcerers and witches</span>
				<span class='text'>Having reached as far as the San Juan River (part of the present boundary between [[Ecuador]] and [[Colombia]]), Andagoya fell very ill and decided to return</span>
				<span class='text'>Back in [[Panama]], he spread the news and stories about &quot;Pirú&quot; – a great land to the south rich with gold (the legendary [[El Dorado]])</span>
				<span class='text'>These revelations, along with the accounts of success of Hernán Cortés in [[Mexico]] years before, caught the immediate attention of Pizarro, prompting a new series of expeditions to the south in search of the riches of the Incan Empire</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1524, while still in Panama, Pizarro formed a partnership with a priest, [[Hernando de Luque]], and a soldier, [[Diego de Almagro]], to explore and conquer the South</span>
				<span class='text'>Pizarro, Almagro, and Luque later renewed their compact more explicitly,&lt;ref name=Hemming/&gt;{{rp|24}} agreeing to conquer and divide equally among themselves the opulent empire they hoped to discover</span>
				<span class='text'>While historians agree their accord was strictly oral (no written document exists to prove otherwise), they are known to have dubbed their enterprise the ''Empresa del Levante'' and determined that Pizarro would command the expedition, Almagro would provide the military and food supplies, and Luque would be in charge of finances and any additional provisions they might need</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Prescott/&gt;{{rp|95}}===First expedition (1524)===In November 1524, the first of three expeditions left from Panama for the conquest of Peru with about 80 men and 40 horses</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Hemming/&gt;{{rp|24}} Juan de Salcedo was the standard bearer, [[Nicolas de Ribera]] was the treasurer, and Juan Carvallo was the inspector</span>

				<span class='text'>The Governor of Panama, [[Pedrarias Dávila|Pedro Arias Dávila]], at first approved in principle of exploring South America</span>
				<span class='text'>Pizarro's first expedition, however, turned out to be a failure as his ''conquistadores'', sailing down the Pacific coast, reached no farther than Colombia before succumbing to such hardships as bad weather, lack of food, and skirmishes with hostile natives, one of which caused Almagro to lose an eye by arrow-shot</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, the place names the Spanish bestowed along their route, including ''Puerto Deseado'' (desired port), ''Puerto del Hambre'' (port of hunger), and ''Punta Quemado'' or ''Puebla Quemado'' (burned port), only confirm their straits</span>
				<span class='text'>Fearing subsequent hostile encounters like the one the expedition endured at the [[Battle of Punta Quemada]], Pizarro chose to end his tentative first expedition and return to Panama</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Prescott/&gt;{{rp|94–102}}===Second expedition (1526)===Two years after the first very unsuccessful expedition, Pizarro, Almagro, and Luque started the arrangements for a second expedition with permission from Pedrarias Dávila</span>
				<span class='text'>The governor, who himself was preparing an expedition north to [[Nicaragua]], was reluctant to permit another expedition, having lost confidence in the outcome of Pizarro's expeditions</span>
				<span class='text'>The three associates, however, eventually won his trust and he acquiesced</span>
				<span class='text'>Also by this time, a new governor was to arrive and succeed Pedrarias Dávila</span>
				<span class='text'>This was [[Pedro de los Ríos y Gutiérrez de Aguayo|Pedro de los Ríos]], who took charge of the post in July 1526 and had manifested his initial approval of Pizarro's expeditions (he would later join him several years later in Peru)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Prescott/&gt;{{rp|103–104}}On 10 March 1526, after all preparations were ready, Pizarro left Panama with two ships with 160 men and several horses, reaching as far as the Colombian San Juan River</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon after arriving the party separated, with Pizarro staying to explore the new and often perilous territory off the swampy Colombian coasts, while the expedition's co-commander, Almagro, was sent back to Panama for reinforcements</span>
				<span class='text'>Pizarro's ''Piloto Mayor'' (main pilot), Bartolomé Ruiz, continued sailing south and, after crossing the [[equator]], found and captured a ''balsa'' (raft) under sail, with natives from [[Tumbes (city)|Tumbes]]</span>
				<span class='text'>To everyone's surprise, these carried a load of textiles, ceramic objects, and some much-desired pieces of gold, [[silver]], and [[emeralds]], making Ruiz's findings the central focus of this second expedition which only served to pique the conquistadors' interests for more gold and land</span>
				<span class='text'>Some of the natives were also taken aboard Ruiz's ship to serve later as interpreters</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Prescott/&gt;{{rp|105–109}}&lt;ref name=Hemming/&gt;{{rp|24–25}}He then set sail north for the San Juan River, arriving to find Pizarro and his men exhausted from the serious difficulties they had faced exploring the new territory</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon Almagro also sailed into the port with his vessel laden with supplies, and a considerable reinforcement of at least eighty recruited men who had arrived at Panama from Spain with the same expeditionary spirit</span>
				<span class='text'>The findings and excellent news from Ruiz along with Almagro's new reinforcements cheered Pizarro and his tired followers</span>
				<span class='text'>They then decided to sail back to the territory already explored by Ruiz and, after a difficult voyage due to strong winds and currents, reached [[Atacames]] in the Ecuadorian coast</span>
				<span class='text'>Here, they found a very large native population recently brought under Inca rule</span>
				<span class='text'>Unfortunately for the ''conquistadores'', the warlike spirit of the people they had just encountered seemed so defiant and dangerous in numbers that the Spanish decided not to enter the land</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Prescott/&gt;{{rp|110–112}}[[Image:Conquest peru 1531</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Francisco Pizarro's route of exploration during the conquest of Peru (1531–1533)]]====The Famous Thirteen====After much wrangling between Pizarro and Almagro, it was decided that Pizarro would stay at a safer place, the Isla de Gallo,&lt;ref name=Hemming/&gt;{{rp|25–26}} near the coast, while Almagro would return yet again to Panama with Luque for more reinforcements – this time with proof of the gold they had just found and the news of the discovery of an obvious wealthy land they had just explored</span>
				<span class='text'>The new governor of Panama, Pedro de los Ríos, had learned of the mishaps of Pizarro's expeditions and the deaths of various settlers who had gone with him</span>
				<span class='text'>Fearing an unsuccessful outcome, he outright rejected Almagro's application for continued resources</span>
				<span class='text'> In addition, he ordered two ships commanded by Juan Tafur to be sent immediately with the intention of bringing Pizarro and everyone back to Panama</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Prescott/&gt;{{rp|112–115}}The leader of the expedition had no intention of returning, and when Tafur arrived at the now famous Isla de Gallo, Pizarro drew a line in the sand, saying: &quot;There lies Peru with its riches; Here, Panama and its poverty</span>
				<span class='text'>Choose, each man, what best becomes a brave Castilian</span>
				<span class='text'> For my part, I go to the south</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=Prescott/&gt;{{rp|116}}Only 13 men decided to stay with Pizarro and later became known as &quot;The [[Famous Thirteen]]&quot; (''Los trece de la fama''),&lt;ref name=Hemming/&gt;{{rp|26}} while the rest of the expeditioners stayed with Tafur aboard his ships</span>
				<span class='text'>Ruiz also left in one of the ships with the intention of joining Almagro and Luque in their efforts to gather more reinforcements and eventually return to aid Pizarro</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon after the ships left, Pizarro and his men constructed a crude boat and journeyed 25 [[league (unit)|league]]s north for La Isla Gorgona, where they would remain for seven months before the arrival of new provisions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Prescott/&gt;{{rp|117–118}}Back in Panama, Pedro de los Ríos (after much convincing by Luque) had finally acquiesced to the requests for another ship, but only to bring Pizarro back within six months and completely abandon the expedition</span>
				<span class='text'>Both Almagro and Luque quickly grasped the opportunity and left Panama (this time without new recruits) for La Isla Gorgona to once again join Pizarro</span>
				<span class='text'>On meeting with Pizarro, the associates decided to continue sailing south on the recommendations of Ruiz's Indian interpreters</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Prescott/&gt;{{rp|118}}By April 1528, they finally reached the northwestern Peruvian [[Tumbes Region]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Tumbes became the territory of the first fruits of success the Spanish had so long desired, as they were received with a warm welcome of hospitality and provisions from the Tumpis, the local inhabitants</span>
				<span class='text'>On subsequent days two of Pizarro's men, Alonso de Molina and [[Pedro de Candia]], reconnoitered the territory and both, on separate accounts, reported back the incredible riches of the land, including the decorations of silver and gold around the chief's residence and the hospitable attentions with which they were received by everyone</span>
				<span class='text'>The Spanish also saw, for the first time, the Peruvian [[llama]]&lt;ref name=Hemming/&gt;{{rp|26}} which Pizarro called the &quot;little camels&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The natives also began calling the Spanish the &quot;Children of the Sun&quot; due to their fair complexions and brilliant armor</span>
				<span class='text'>Pizarro, meanwhile, continued receiving the same accounts of a powerful monarch who ruled over the land they were exploring</span>
				<span class='text'>These events only served as evidence to convince the expedition of the wealth and power displayed at Tumbes as an example of the riches the Peruvian territory had awaiting to conquer</span>
				<span class='text'>The conquistadors decided to return to Panama to prepare the final expedition of conquest with more recruits and provisions</span>
				<span class='text'>Before leaving, however, Pizarro and his followers sailed south not so far along the coast to see if anything of interest could be found</span>
				<span class='text'>Historian [[William Hickling Prescott|William H</span>
				<span class='text'>Prescott]] recounts that after passing through territories they named such as Cabo Blanco, port of Payta, Sechura, Punta de Aguja, Santa Cruz, and [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]] (founded by Almagro years later), they finally reached for the first time the ninth degree of the southern latitude in South America</span>
				<span class='text'>On their return towards Panama, Pizarro briefly stopped at Tumbes, where two of his men had decided to stay to learn the customs and language of the natives</span>
				<span class='text'>Pizarro was also given two boys to learn his language, one of whom was later baptized as [[Felipillo]] and served as an important interpreter, the equivalent of Cortés' [[La Malinche]] of Mexico, and another called Martinillo</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Leon&quot;/&gt;{{rp|126,128}}  Their final stop was at La Isla Gorgona, where two of his ill men (one had died) had stayed before</span>
				<span class='text'>After at least 18 months away, Pizarro and his followers anchored off the coasts of Panama to prepare for the final expedition</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Prescott/&gt;{{rp|119–126}}===Capitulación de Toledo===When the new governor of Panama, Pedro de los Ríos, had refused to allow for a third expedition to the south, the associates resolved for Pizarro to leave for Spain and appeal to the sovereign in person</span>
				<span class='text'>Pizarro sailed from Panama for Spain in the spring of 1528, accompanied by Pedro de Candia, some natives and llamas, plus samples of fabric, gold, and silver</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Prescott/&gt;{{rp|127–128}}Pizzaro reached [[Seville]] in early summer</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|King Charles I]], who was at [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], had an interview with Pizarro and heard of his expeditions in South America, a territory the conquistador described as very rich in gold and silver which he and his followers had bravely explored &quot;to extend the empire of Castile</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The king, who was soon to leave for Italy, was impressed at the accounts of Pizarro and promised to give his support for the conquest of Peru</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Isabella of Portugal|Queen Isabel]], though, in the absence of the king, signed the ''Capitulación de Toledo'' on 6 July 1529,&lt;ref&gt;[http://college</span>

				<span class='text'>Pizarro was officially named the Governor, [[Captain general]], ''[[Adelantado]]'', and ''[[Alguacil]] Mayor'', of the New Castile for the distance of 200 leagues along the newly discovered coast, and invested with all the authority and prerogatives, his associates being left in wholly secondary positions (a fact which later incensed Almagro and would lead to eventual discords with Pizarro)</span>
				<span class='text'>One of the conditions of the grant was that within six months, Pizarro should raise a sufficiently equipped force of 250 men, of whom 100 might be drawn from the colonies</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Prescott/&gt;{{rp|132–134,137}}This gave Pizarro time to leave for his native Trujillo and convince his brother [[Hernando Pizarro]] and other close friends to join him on his third expedition</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Prescott/&gt;{{rp|136}} Along with him also came [[Francisco de Orellana]], who would later discover and explore the entire length of the [[Amazon River]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Two more of his brothers from his father, [[Juan Pizarro (conquistador)|Juan Pizarro]] and [[Gonzalo Pizarro]],&lt;ref name=Hemming/&gt;{{rp|27}} and a brother from his mother, Francisco Martin de Alcantara,&lt;ref name=Prescott/&gt;{{rp|136}} would later decide to also join him, as well as his cousin [[Pedro Pizarro]], who served as his [[page (occupation)|page]]</span>

				<span class='text'>tml History of the Conquest of Peru], chapter 28</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Historians have often compared Pizarro and Cortés' conquests in North and South America as very similar in style and career</span>
				<span class='text'>Pizarro, however, faced the Incas with a smaller army and fewer resources than Cortés at a much greater distance from the Spanish Caribbean outposts that could easily support him, which has led some to rank Pizarro slightly ahead of Cortés in their battles for conquest</span>
				<span class='text'>Based on sheer numbers alone, Pizarro's military victory was one of the most improbable in recorded history</span>
				<span class='text'>izarro is well known in Peru for being the leader behind the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire, and a growing number of Peruvians of strong indigenous descent which are the majority of Peru regard him negatively</span>
				<span class='text'>By incorporating the natives into the society of Peru, Pizarro ruled Peru for almost a decade and initiated the decline of Inca culture</span>
				<span class='text'>The Incas’ polytheistic religion was replaced by Christianity and both [[Quechua language|Quechua]] and [[Aymara language|Aymara]] — the main Inca languages — were reduced to a marginal role in society for centuries, while Spanish became the official language of Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Chile</span>
				<span class='text'>The cities of the Inca Empire were transformed into Spanish, Catholic cities</span>
				<span class='text'>Pizarro is also vilified for having ordered Atahualpa's death despite his paid ransom of filling a room with gold and two with silver which was later split among all his closest Spanish associates after a fifth share had been set aside for the king</span>
				<span class='text'>Among other once-Spanish nations in the Americas, those which have a large creole or mestizo population with mostly European ancestry notably Mexico, El Salvador, Argentina, and Chile, regard Francisco Pizarro as a hero much like Cortes because they have the religion, culture, and prosperity today because of conquistadors such as them</span>
				<span class='text'>==Sculptures===In the early 1930s, sculptor Ramsey MacDonald created three copies of an anonymous European foot soldier resembling a conquistador with a helmet, wielding a sword, and riding a horse</span>
				<span class='text'>The first copy was offered to Mexico to represent Hernán Cortés, though it was rejected</span>
				<span class='text'>Since the Spanish conquerors had the same appearance with helmet and beard, the statue was taken to Lima in 1934</span>
				<span class='text'>One other copy of the statue resides in Wisconsin</span>
				<span class='text'>The mounted statue of Pizarro in the Plaza Mayor in Trujillo, Spain, was created by Charles Rumsey, an American sculptor</span>
				<span class='text'>It was presented to the city by his widow in 1926</span>
				<span class='text'>n 2003, after years of lobbying by indigenous and mixed-raced majority requesting for the equestrian statue of Pizarro to be removed, the mayor of Lima, [[Luis Castañeda Lossio]], approved the transfer of the statue to another location: an adjacent square to the country's [[Government Palace (Peru)|Government Palace]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Since 2004, however, Pizarro's statue has been placed in a rehabilitated park surrounded by the recently restored 17th-century walls in the [[Rímac District]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The statue faces the [[Rímac River]] and the Government Palace</span>
