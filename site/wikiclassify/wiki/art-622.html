				<span class='text'>She was named a [[Kennedy Center Honors|Kennedy Center Honoree]] in 1989</span>
				<span class='text'>She was also the mother of actor [[Larry Hagman]]</span>
				<span class='text'>= Early life ==Martin was born in [[Weatherford, Texas]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Her life as a child, as she describes it in her [[autobiography]] ''My Heart Belongs'', was secure and happy</span>
				<span class='text'>She had close relationships with both her mother and father, as well as her siblings</span>
				<span class='text'>Her autobiography details how the young actress had an instinctive ear for recreating musical sounds</span>
				<span class='text'>artin's father, Preston Martin, was a lawyer, and her mother, Juanita Presley, was a violin teacher</span>

				<span class='text'>om}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the doctors told Juanita that she would risk her life if she attempted to have another baby, she was determined to have a boy</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, she had Mary, who became quite a tomboy</span>
				<span class='text'>Her birth was an event as all of the neighbors gathered around Juanita's bedroom window, waiting for the raising of a curtain to signal the baby’s arrival</span>
				<span class='text'>er family had a barn and [[orchard]] that kept her entertained</span>
				<span class='text'>She played with her older sister Geraldine (whom she called “Sister”), climbing trees and riding ponies</span>
				<span class='text'>Martin adored her father</span>
				<span class='text'>“He was tall, good-looking, silver-haired, with the kindest brown eyes</span>
				<span class='text'>Mother was the disciplinarian, but it was Daddy who could turn me into an angel with just one look” (p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;19)</span>
				<span class='text'>Martin, who said “I’d never understand the law” (p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;19), began singing outside the courtroom where her father worked every Saturday night at a bandstand where the town band played</span>
				<span class='text'>She sang in a trio of little girls – herself, her sister, and Marion Swofford, dressed in bellhop uniforms</span>
				<span class='text'>“Even in those days without microphones, my high piping voice carried all over the square</span>
				<span class='text'>I have always thought that I inherited my carrying voice from my father” (p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;19)</span>
				<span class='text'>he remembered having a photographic memory as a child, making it easy to memorize songs, as well as get her through school tests</span>
				<span class='text'>She got her first taste of singing solo at a fire hall, where she soaked up the crowd’s appreciation</span>
				<span class='text'>“Sometimes I think that I cheated my own family and my closest friends by giving to audiences so much of the love I might have kept for them</span>
				<span class='text'>But that’s the way I was made; I truly don't think I could help it” (p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;20)</span>
				<span class='text'>Martin’s craft was developed by seeing movies and becoming a mimic</span>
				<span class='text'>She’d win prizes for looking, acting and dancing like [[Ruby Keeler]] and singing exactly like [[Bing Crosby]]</span>
				<span class='text'>“Never, never, never can I say I had a frustrating childhood</span>
				<span class='text'>It was all joy</span>
				<span class='text'>Mother used to say she never had seen such a happy child—that I awakened each morning with a smile</span>
				<span class='text'>I don’t remember that, but I do remember that I never wanted to go to bed, to go to sleep, for fear I’d miss something” (p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;20)</span>
				<span class='text'>=Marriage==During high school, Martin dated Benjamin Hagman, before she was packed off to [[finishing school]] at [[Ward-Belmont College|Ward-Belmont]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]</span>
				<span class='text'>During that time, she enjoyed imitating [[Fanny Brice]] at singing gigs, but she found school dull and felt confined by its strict rules</span>
				<span class='text'>She was homesick for Weatherford, her family, and Hagman</span>
				<span class='text'>During a visit, Mary and Benjamin persuaded Mary's mother to allow them to marry</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Davis, p</span>
				<span class='text'>16&lt;/ref&gt; They did, and by the age of 17, Martin was legally married, pregnant with her first child ([[Larry Hagman]]) and forced to leave Ward-Belmont</span>
				<span class='text'>She was, however, happy to begin her new life, but she soon learned that this life, as she would later say, was nothing but “role playing” (p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;39)</span>
				<span class='text'>heir honeymoon was at her parents' house, and Martin's dream of life with a family and a white-picket fence faded</span>
				<span class='text'>“I was 17, a married woman without real responsibilities, miserable about my mixed-up emotions, afraid there was something awfully wrong with me because I didn’t enjoy being a wife</span>
				<span class='text'>Worst of all, I didn't have enough to do” (p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;39)</span>
				<span class='text'>It was “Sister” who came to her rescue, suggesting that she should teach dance</span>
				<span class='text'>“Sister” taught Martin her first real dance—the waltz clog</span>
				<span class='text'>Martin perfectly imitated her first dance move, and she opened a dance studio</span>
				<span class='text'>Here, she created her own moves, imitated the famous dancers she watched in the movies, and taught “Sister’s” waltz clog</span>
				<span class='text'>As she later recalled, “I was doing something I wanted to do—creating” (p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;44)</span>
				<span class='text'>=Apprenticeship==Wanting to learn more moves, Martin went to California to attend the dance school at the Franchon and Marco School of the Theatre, and opened her own dance studio in [[Mineral Wells, Texas]]</span>
				<span class='text'>She was given a ballroom studio with the premise that she would sing in the lobby every Saturday</span>
				<span class='text'>There, she learned how to sing into a microphone and how to phrase blues songs</span>
				<span class='text'>One day at work, she accidentally walked into the wrong room where auditions were being held</span>
				<span class='text'>They asked her in what key she would like to sing “So Red Rose”</span>
				<span class='text'>Having absolutely no idea what her key was, she sang regardless and got the job</span>
				<span class='text'>She was hired to sing “So Red Rose” at the [[Fox Theatre (San Francisco)|Fox Theater]] in [[San Francisco]], followed by the Paramount Theater in [[Los Angeles]]</span>
				<span class='text'>There would be one catch—she had to sing in the wings</span>
				<span class='text'>She scored her first professional gig, unaware that she would soon be center stage</span>
				<span class='text'>oon after, Martin learned that her studio had been burnt down by a man who thought dancing was a sin</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Davis, p</span>
				<span class='text'>24&lt;/ref&gt;  She began to express her unhappiness</span>
				<span class='text'>Her father gave her advice, saying that she was too young to be married</span>
				<span class='text'>Martin left everything behind, including her young son, Larry, and went to [[Hollywood]] while her father handled the divorce for her</span>
				<span class='text'>In Hollywood, Martin plunged herself into auditions—so many that she became known as “Audition Mary”</span>
				<span class='text'>Her first professional audition and job was on a national radio network</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Davis, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>26–29, 31&lt;/ref&gt;  Among Martin's first auditions in Hollywood, Martin sang, &quot;[[Indian Love Call]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>After singing the song, “a tall, craggly man who looked like a mountain” told Martin that he thought she had something special</span>
				<span class='text'>It was [[Oscar Hammerstein II]] (pp</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;58–59)</span>
				<span class='text'>This marked the start of her career</span>
				<span class='text'>=Radio==Martin began her radio career in 1939 as the vocalist on a short-lived revival of ''The Tuesday Night Party'' on [[CBS]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1940, she was a singer on [[NBC]]'s ''Good News of 1940'', which was renamed ''Maxwell House Coffee Time'' during that year</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=dunningota/&gt;==Broadway==Mary Martin struggled for nearly two years to break into show business</span>
				<span class='text'>As a struggling young actress, Martin endured humorous and sometimes frightful luck trying to make it in the world, from car crashes leading to vocal instruction, unknowingly singing in front of [[Oscar Hammerstein II]], to her final break on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] granted by the very prominent producer, Lawrence Schwab</span>
				<span class='text'>sing her maiden name, Mary Martin began pursuing a performing career singing on radio in Dallas and in nightclubs in Los Angeles</span>
				<span class='text'>Her performance at one club impressed a theatrical producer, and he cast her in a play in New York, but that production did not open</span>
				<span class='text'>he was then cast in [[Cole Porter]]'s ''[[Leave It to Me!]]'', making her Broadway debut in November 1938</span>
				<span class='text'>In that production, she became popular on Broadway and received attention in the national media singing &quot;[[My Heart Belongs to Daddy]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>With that one song in the second act, she became a star 'overnight'</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p</span>
				<span class='text'>41&lt;/ref&gt;  Martin reprised the song in ''[[Night and Day (1946 film)|Night and Day]],'' a Hollywood film about Cole Porter, in which she played herself auditioning for Porter ([[Cary Grant]])</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;My Heart Belongs to Daddy&quot; catapulted her career and became very special to Martin—she even sang it to her ailing father in his hospital bed while he was in a [[coma]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Martin did not learn immediately that her father had died</span>
				<span class='text'>Headlines read &quot;Daddy Girl Sings About Daddy as Daddy Dies</span>
