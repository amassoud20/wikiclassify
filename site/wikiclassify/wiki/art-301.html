				<span class='text'>In 1930, director Raoul Walsh saw him moving studio furniture while working as a prop boy and cast him in his first starring role in ''[[The Big Trail]]'' (1930)</span>

				<span class='text'>The Fox Studios chief [[Winfield Sheehan]] rejected it as sounding &quot;too Italian&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>To take advantage of the breathtaking scenery, it was filmed in two versions, a standard 35-mm version and another in the new [[70-mm Grandeur film]] process, using an innovative camera and lenses</span>
				<span class='text'>Many in the audience who saw it in Grandeur stood and cheered</span>
				<span class='text'>Unfortunately, only a handful of theaters were equipped to show the film in its widescreen process, and the effort was largely wasted</span>

				<span class='text'>After rejection by all the top studios, Ford struck a deal with independent producer [[Walter Wanger]] in which [[Claire Trevor]]—a much bigger star at the time—received top billing</span>
				<span class='text'>''Stagecoach'' was a huge critical and financial success, and Wayne became a mainstream star</span>

				<span class='text'> Only [[Clark Gable]] sold more tickets than Wayne, although the ticket prices were not commensurate since, although both actors started their careers at the same time, Gable's career height preceded Wayne's by approximately fifteen years</span>
				<span class='text'>=Missed roles==*In 1948, Wayne was offered the role of Jimmy Ringo in ''[[The Gunfighter]]'', a script that [[Columbia Pictures]] had purchased specifically for him</span>
				<span class='text'>Wayne turned it down, despite having expressed a strong desire to play the part, because of his longstanding feud with Columbia's president, [[Harry Cohn]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Columbia sold the rights to [[Twentieth Century Fox]], where the role went to [[Gregory Peck]]</span>
				<span class='text'>  Wayne's final film, ''[[The Shootist]]'' (1976), is often compared to ''The Gunfighter'' and contains numerous plot similarities</span>

				<span class='text'>In a 1971 interview, Wayne said he considered ''High Noon'' &quot;the most un-American thing I've ever seen in my whole life&quot;, and that he would &quot;never regret having helped run [screenwriter [[Carl Foreman]], who was later blacklisted] out of the country&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=davis/&gt;{{rp|142}}*An urban legend has it that in 1955, Wayne turned down the role of Matt Dillon in the long-running television series ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' and recommended [[James Arness]] instead</span>
				<span class='text'>While he did suggest Arness for the part, and introduced him in a prologue to the first episode, no film star of Wayne's stature would have considered a television role at the time</span>
