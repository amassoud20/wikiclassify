				<span class='text'>An extremely influential figure in modern British comedy, Cook is regarded as the leading light of the British [[satire boom]] of the 1960s</span>
				<span class='text'>He was closely associated with the [[anti-establishment]] comedy that emerged in Britain and the United States in the late 1950s</span>
				<span class='text'>n 2005, Cook was ranked at number one in the ''Comedians' Comedian'', a poll of over 300 comics, comedy writers, producers and directors throughout the [[List of countries where English is an official language|English-speaking world]]</span>

				<span class='text'>He was the only son and eldest of the three children of Alexander Edward &quot;Alec&quot; Cook (1906–1984), a colonial civil servant, and his wife Ethel Catherine Margaret, ''née'' Mayo (1908–1994)</span>
				<span class='text'>He was educated at [[Radley College]] and [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]], where he studied French and German</span>
				<span class='text'>As a student, Cook initially intended to become a career diplomat like his father, but Britain &quot;had run out of colonies&quot;, as he put it</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Although politically largely apathetic, particularly in later life when he displayed a deep distrust of politicians of all hues, he did join the [[Cambridge University Liberal Club]]</span>

				<span class='text'>His hero was fellow Footlights writer and Cambridge magazine writer [[David Nobbs]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;I Didn't Get Where I am Today by David Nobbs 9780099421641&lt;/ref&gt;Whilst still at university, Cook wrote for [[Kenneth Williams]], providing several sketches for Williams' West End comedy revue ''Pieces of Eight'' and much of the follow-up, ''One Over the Eight'', before finding prominence in his own right in a four-man group satirical stage show, ''[[Beyond the Fringe]]'', with [[Jonathan Miller]], [[Alan Bennett]] and [[Dudley Moore]]</span>
				<span class='text'>'Beyond the Fringe'' became a great success in London after being first performed at the [[Edinburgh Festival]] and included Cook impersonating the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]], [[Harold Macmillan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This was one of the first occasions satirical political mimicry had been attempted in live theatre and it shocked audiences</span>
				<span class='text'>During one performance, Macmillan was in the theatre and Cook departed from his script and attacked him verbally</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cook as Macmillan: &quot;there's nothing I like better than to wander over to a theatre and sit there listening to a group of sappy, urgent, vibrant young satirists with a stupid great grin spread all over my silly face&quot;, ''Tragically I Was an Only Twin'', p</span>

				<span class='text'>Cook befriended and supported Australian comedian and actor [[Barry Humphries]], who began his British solo career at the club</span>
				<span class='text'>Humphries said in his autobiography, ''My Life As Me'', that he found Cook's lack of interest in art and literature off-putting</span>
				<span class='text'>Cook's chiselled looks and languid manner led Humphries to observe that whereas most people take after their father or mother, Cook seemed more like an aunt</span>
				<span class='text'>Dudley Moore's jazz trio played in the basement of the club during the early 1960s</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1962, the [[BBC]] commissioned a pilot for a television series of satirical sketches based on the Establishment Club, but it was not picked up straight away and Cook went to New York City for a year to perform in ''Beyond The Fringe'' on Broadway</span>
				<span class='text'>When he returned, the pilot had been refashioned as ''[[That Was the Week That Was]]'' and had made a star of [[David Frost]], something Cook resented</span>
				<span class='text'>The 1960s [[satire boom]] was closing and Cook said &quot;England was about to sink giggling into the sea&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>This incident occurred in the summer of 1963, when the rivalry between the two men was at its height</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Around this time, Cook provided financial backing for the satirical magazine ''[[Private Eye]]'', supporting it through difficult periods, particularly in [[libel]] trials</span>
				<span class='text'>Cook invested his own money and solicited investment from his friends</span>
				<span class='text'>For a time, the magazine was produced from the premises of the Establishment Club</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1963, Cook married Wendy Snowden; the couple had two daughters, Lucy and Daisy, but the marriage ended in 1970</span>
				<span class='text'>ook expanded television comedy with [[Eleanor Bron]], [[John Bird (actor)|John Bird]] and [[John Fortune]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His first regular television spot was on [[Granada Television]]'s ''Braden Beat'' with [[Bernard Braden]], where he featured his most enduring character: the static, dour and monotonal [[E</span>

				<span class='text'>This was intended by the BBC for Moore's music, but Moore invited Cook to write sketches and appear with him</span>
				<span class='text'>Using few props, they created dry and absurd television that lasted for three series between 1965 and 1970</span>
				<span class='text'>Cook played characters such as [[Sir Arthur Streeb-Greebling]] and the two men created their [[Pete and Dud]] alter egos</span>
				<span class='text'>Other sketches included &quot;Superthunderstingcar&quot;, a parody of the [[Gerry Anderson]] marionette TV shows, and Cook's pastiche of 1960s trendy arts documentaries – satirised in a parodic TV segment on [[Greta Garbo]]</span>
				<span class='text'>hen Cook learned a few years later that the videotapes of the series were to be [[Wiping|wiped]], a common practice at the time, he offered to buy the recordings from the BBC but was refused because of copyright issues</span>
				<span class='text'>He suggested he could purchase new tapes so that the BBC would have no need to erase the originals, but this was also turned down</span>
				<span class='text'>Of the original programmes, only eight of the twenty-two episodes still survive complete</span>
				<span class='text'>A compilation of six half-hour programmes, ''The Best of What's Left of Not Only</span>

				<span class='text'>ith ''[[The Wrong Box]]'' (1966) and ''[[Bedazzled (1967 film)|Bedazzled]]'' (1967) Cook and Moore began to act in films together</span>
				<span class='text'>Directed by [[Stanley Donen]], the underlying story of ''Bedazzled'' is credited to Cook and Moore and its screenplay to Cook</span>
				<span class='text'>A comic parody of [[Faust]], it stars Cook as George Spigott (The Devil) who tempts Stanley Moon (Moore), a frustrated, short-order chef, with the promise of gaining his heart's desire – the unattainable beauty and waitress at his cafe, Margaret Spencer ([[Eleanor Bron]]) – in exchange for his soul, but repeatedly tricks him</span>
				<span class='text'>The film features cameo appearances by [[Barry Humphries]] as Envy and [[Raquel Welch]] as Lust</span>
				<span class='text'>Moore composed the soundtrack music and co-wrote (with Cook) the songs performed in the film</span>
				<span class='text'>His jazz trio backed Cook on the theme, a parodic anti-love song, which Cook delivered in a monotonous deadpan voice and included his familiar put-down, &quot;You fill me with inertia</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;In 1968, Cook and Moore briefly switched to [[Associated TeleVision|ATV]] for four one-hour programmes entitled ''[[Goodbye Again (TV)|Goodbye Again]]'', based on the Pete and Dud characters</span>
				<span class='text'>Cook's increasing alcoholism led him to become reliant on cue cards and the show was not a popular success, owing in part to the publication of the ITV [[listings magazine]], ''[[TV Times]]'', being suspended because of a strike</span>

				<span class='text'>Under Cook's guidance, the character became modelled on Frost</span>

				<span class='text'>He was replaced after only two episodes by [[Michael Parkinson]], the start of Parkinson's career as a chat show host</span>

				<span class='text'>This show toured Australia in 1972 before transferring to New York City in 1973, re-titled as ''Good Evening''</span>
				<span class='text'>Cook frequently appeared on and off stage the worse for drink</span>
				<span class='text'>Nonetheless, the show proved very popular and it won [[Tony Award|Tony]] and [[Grammy Award]]s</span>

				<span class='text'>ater, the more risqué humour of Pete and Dud went farther on [[gramophone record|long-playing records]] as &quot;[[Derek and Clive]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The first recording was initiated by Cook to alleviate boredom during the Broadway run of ''Good Evening'' and used material conceived years before for the two characters but considered too outrageous</span>
				<span class='text'>One of these audio recordings was also filmed and tensions between the duo are seen to rise</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Chris Blackwell]] circulated [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]] copies to friends in the music business</span>
				<span class='text'>The popularity of the recording convinced Cook to release it commercially, although Moore was initially reluctant, fearing that his rising fame as a Hollywood star would be undermined</span>
				<span class='text'>Two further ''Derek and Clive'' albums were released, the last accompanied by a film</span>
				<span class='text'>ook and Moore hosted [[Saturday Night Live]] on 24 January 1976 during the SNL first season</span>
				<span class='text'>They did a number of their classic stage routines, including &quot;One Legged Tarzan&quot; and &quot;Frog and Peach&quot; among others, in addition to participating in some skits with the show's &quot;not ready for prime-time&quot; ensemble</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1978, Cook appeared on the British music series ''[[Revolver (TV series)|Revolver]]'' as the manager of a ballroom where emerging punk and new wave acts played</span>
				<span class='text'>For some groups, these were their first appearances on television</span>
				<span class='text'>Cook's acerbic commentary was a distinctive aspect of the programme</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1979, Cook recorded comedy-segments as B-sides to the [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]] 12-inch singles &quot;Number One in Heaven&quot; and &quot;Tryouts for the Human Race&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The main songwriter [[Ron Mael]] often started off a banal situation in his lyrics, and then went at surreal tangents in the style of Cook and [[S</span>

				<span class='text'>==''Consequences'' album===Cook played multiple roles on the 1977 [[concept album]] ''[[Consequences (Godley &amp; Creme album)|Consequences]]'', written and produced by former [[10cc]] members [[Kevin Godley]] and [[Lol Creme]]</span>
				<span class='text'>A mixture of spoken comedy and [[progressive rock]] with an [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]al subtext, ''Consequences'' started as a single that Godley and Creme planned to make to demonstrate their invention, an electric guitar effect called [[the Gizmo]], which they developed in 10cc</span>
				<span class='text'>The project grew into a triple LP boxed set</span>
				<span class='text'>The comedy sections were originally intended to be performed by a cast including [[Spike Milligan]] and [[Peter Ustinov]], but Godley and Creme eventually settled on Cook once they realised he could perform most parts himself</span>
				<span class='text'>he storyline centres on the impending divorce of ineffectual Englishman Walter Stapleton (Cook) and his French wife Lulu ([[Judy Huxtable]])</span>
				<span class='text'>While meeting their lawyers – the bibulous Mr Haig and overbearing Mr Pepperman (both played by Cook) – the encroaching global catastrophe interrupts proceedings with bizarre and mysterious happenings, which seem to centre on Mr Blint (Cook), a musician and composer living in the flat below Haig's office, to which it is connected by a large hole in the floor</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough it has since developed a cult following due to Cook's presence, ''Consequences'' was released as [[Punk rock|punk]] was sweeping the UK and proved a resounding commercial failure, savaged by critics who found the music self-indulgent</span>
				<span class='text'>The script and story have evident connections to Cook's own life – his then wife Judy Huxtable, plays Walter's wife</span>
				<span class='text'>Cook's struggles with alcohol are mirrored in Haig's drinking, and there is a parallel between the fictional divorce of Walter and Lulu and Cook's own divorce from his first wife</span>
				<span class='text'>The voice and accent Cook used for the character of Stapleton are similar to Cook's [[Beyond the Fringe]] colleague, Alan Bennett, and a book on Cook's comedy, ''How Very Interesting'', speculates that the characters Cook plays in ''Consequences'' are caricatures of the four ''Beyond The Fringe'' cast members – the alcoholic Haig represents Cook, the tremulous Stapleton is Bennett, the parodically Jewish Pepperman is Miller, and the pianist Blint represents Moore</span>

				<span class='text'>The benefits were dubbed ''[[The Secret Policeman's Balls]]'' though it wasn't until the third show in 1979 that the title was used</span>
				<span class='text'>He performed on all three nights of the first show in April 1976, ''[[A Poke in the Eye (With a Sharp Stick)]]'', as an individual performer and as a member of the cast of ''Beyond The Fringe'', which reunited for the first time since the 1960s</span>
				<span class='text'>He also appeared in a [[Monty Python]] sketch, taking the place of [[Eric Idle]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Cook was on the cast album of the show and in the film, ''[[Pleasure at Her Majesty's]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>He was in the second Amnesty gala in May 1977, ''An Evening Without Sir Bernard Miles''</span>
				<span class='text'>It was retitled ''The Mermaid Frolics'' for the cast album and TV special</span>
				<span class='text'>Cook performed monologues and skits with [[Terry Jones]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n June 1979, Cook performed all four nights of ''[[The Secret Policeman's Ball (1979)|The Secret Policeman's Ball]]'' – teaming with [[John Cleese]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Cook performed a couple of solo pieces and a sketch with [[Eleanor Bron]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also led the ensemble in the finale – the &quot;End of the World&quot; sketch from ''Beyond The Fringe''</span>
				<span class='text'>n response to a barb in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' that the show was recycled material, Cook wrote a satire of the summing-up by [[Mr Justice Cantley]] in the trial of former Liberal Party leader [[Jeremy Thorpe]], a summary thought by some to show bias in favour of Thorpe</span>
				<span class='text'>Cook performed it that same night (Friday 29 June – the third of the four nights) and the following night</span>
				<span class='text'>The nine-minute opus, &quot;Entirely a Matter for You&quot;, is considered by many fans and critics to be one of the finest works of Cook's career</span>
				<span class='text'>Cook and show producer Martin Lewis brought out an album on [[Virgin Records]] entitled ''Here Comes the Judge: Live'' of the live performance together with three studio tracks that further lampooned the Thorpe trial</span>

				<span class='text'>==1980s===In 1980, partly spurred by Moore's growing film star status, Cook moved to Hollywood and appeared as an uptight English butler to a wealthy American woman in a short-lived United States television sitcom, ''[[The Two of Us (1981 TV series)|The Two of Us]]'', also making cameo appearances in a couple of undistinguished films</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1980, Cook starred in the [[LWT]] special ''Peter Cook &amp; Co</span>

				<span class='text'>Using the name &quot;Sven from Swiss Cottage&quot;, he mused on love, loneliness and herrings in a mock Norwegian accent</span>
				<span class='text'>Jokes included Sven's attempts to find his estranged wife, in which he often claimed to be telephoning the show from all over the world, and his hatred of the Norwegian obsession with fish</span>
				<span class='text'>While Bull was clearly aware that Sven was fictional he did not learn Sven's real identity until later</span>

				<span class='text'>Morris described them:{{quote|It was a very different style of improvisation from what I'd been used to, working with people like [[Steve Coogan]], [[Doon Mackichan]] and [[Rebecca Front]], because those ''[[On the Hour]]'' and ''[[The Day Today]]'' things were about trying to establish a character within a situation, and Peter Cook was really doing 'knight's move' and 'double knight's move' thinking to construct jokes or ridiculous scenes flipping back on themselves, and it was amazing</span>
				<span class='text'>I mean, I held out no great hopes that he wouldn't be a boozy old sack of lard with his hair falling out and scarcely able to get a sentence out, because he hadn't given much evidence that that wouldn't be the case</span>
				<span class='text'>But, in fact, he stumbled in with a Safeways bag full of Kestrel lager and loads of fags and then proceeded to skip about mentally with the agility of a grasshopper</span>
