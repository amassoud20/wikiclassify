				<span class='text'>Known for her fierce independence and spirited personality, Hepburn was a leading lady in [[Hollywood]] for more than 60 years</span>
				<span class='text'>She appeared in a range of genres, from [[screwball comedy]] to literary drama, and she received four [[Academy Award]]s for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]—a record for any performer</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1999, Hepburn was named by the [[American Film Institute]] as the [[AFI's 100 Years</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>00 Stars|greatest female star]] of Classic Hollywood Cinema</span>
				<span class='text'>aised in [[Connecticut]] by wealthy, [[Progressive Era|progressive]] parents, Hepburn began to act while studying at [[Bryn Mawr College]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After four years in the theatre, favorable reviews of her work on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] brought her to the attention of Hollywood</span>
				<span class='text'>Her early years in the film industry were marked with success, including an Academy Award for her third picture, ''[[Morning Glory (1933 film)|Morning Glory]]'' (1933), but this was followed by a series of commercial failures which led her to be labeled &quot;box office poison&quot; in 1938</span>
				<span class='text'>Hepburn masterminded her own comeback, buying out [[Studio system|her contract]] with [[RKO Radio Pictures]] and acquiring the film rights to ''[[The Philadelphia Story (play)|The Philadelphia Story]]'', which she sold on the condition that she be the star</span>
				<span class='text'>In the 1940s, she was contracted to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], where her career focused on an alliance with [[Spencer Tracy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The screen-partnership spanned 25 years and produced nine movies</span>
				<span class='text'>epburn challenged herself in the latter half of her life, as she regularly appeared in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]] stage productions and tackled a range of literary roles</span>
				<span class='text'>She found a niche playing middle-aged spinsters, such as in ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' (1951), a persona the public embraced</span>
				<span class='text'>Three more Oscars came for her work in ''[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]]'' (1967), ''[[The Lion in Winter (1968 film)|The Lion in Winter]]'' (1968), and ''[[On Golden Pond (1981 film)|On Golden Pond]]'' (1981)</span>
				<span class='text'>In the 1970s, she began appearing in television films, which became the focus of her career in later life</span>
				<span class='text'>She remained active into old age, making her final screen appearance in 1994 at the age of 87</span>
				<span class='text'>After a period of inactivity and ill health, Hepburn died in 2003 at the age of 96</span>
				<span class='text'>epburn famously shunned the Hollywood publicity machine and refused to conform to society's expectations of women</span>
				<span class='text'>She was outspoken, assertive, athletic, and wore trousers before it was fashionable for women to do so</span>
				<span class='text'>She married once, as a young woman, but thereafter lived independently</span>
				<span class='text'>A 26-year affair with her co-star Spencer Tracy was hidden from the public</span>
				<span class='text'>With her unconventional lifestyle and the independent characters she brought to the screen, Hepburn epitomized the &quot;modern woman&quot; in 20th century America and is remembered as an important cultural figure</span>
				<span class='text'>= Early life and education ==Hepburn was born in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], on May 12, 1907, the second of six children</span>
				<span class='text'>Her parents were Thomas Norval Hepburn (1879–1962), a [[Urology|urologist]] at [[Hartford Hospital]], and [[Katharine Martha Houghton Hepburn|Katharine Martha Houghton]] (1878–1951), a feminist campaigner</span>
				<span class='text'>Both parents fought for social change in America: Thomas Hepburn helped establish the New England [[American Social Health Association|Social Hygiene Association]], which educated the public about [[venereal disease]],&lt;ref name=&quot;britton 41&quot;&gt;Britton (2003) p</span>
				<span class='text'>41</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; while the elder Katharine headed the Connecticut Woman Suffrage Association and later [[Birth control movement in the United States|campaigned for birth control]] with [[Margaret Sanger]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Berg (2004), p</span>
				<span class='text'>40</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; As a child, Hepburn joined her mother on several &quot;Votes For Women&quot; demonstrations</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Chandler (2011) p</span>
				<span class='text'>37</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The Hepburn children were raised to exercise freedom of speech and encouraged to think and debate on any topic they wished</span>

				<span class='text'>2</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Her parents were criticized by the community for their progressive views, which stimulated Hepburn to fight against barriers she encountered</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Hepburn was eager for his children to use their minds and bodies to the limit, and taught them to swim, run, dive, ride, wrestle, and play golf and tennis</span>

				<span class='text'>43; Higham (2004) p</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Golf became a passion of Katharine's; she took daily lessons and became very adept, reaching the semi-final of the Connecticut Young Women's Golf Championship</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;higham p 7&quot;/&gt; She loved swimming in [[Long Island Sound]], and took ice-cold baths every morning in the belief that &quot;the bitterer the medicine, the better it was for you</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Higham (2004) p</span>
				<span class='text'>3</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Hepburn was a fan of movies from a young age, and went to see one every Saturday night</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Chandler (2011) p</span>
				<span class='text'>34</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; She would put on plays and perform for her neighbors with friends and siblings for 50 cents a ticket to raise money for the [[Navajo people]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Higham (2004) p</span>
				<span class='text'>4</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;On April 3, 1921, while visiting friends in [[Greenwich Village]], Hepburn discovered the body of her adored older brother, Tom,&lt;ref&gt;Hepburn (1991) p</span>
				<span class='text'>44</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; dead from an apparent suicide</span>
				<span class='text'>He had tied a sheet around a beam and hanged himself</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hepburn (1991) p</span>
				<span class='text'>46</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The Hepburn family denied it was suicide and maintained that Tom's death must have been an experiment that had gone wrong</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Chandler (2011) p</span>
				<span class='text'>6</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The incident made the teenage Hepburn nervous, moody, and suspicious of people</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Higham (2004) p</span>
				<span class='text'>5</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; She shied away from other children, dropped out of [[Kingswood-Oxford School|Oxford School]], and began receiving private tutoring</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hepburn (1991) p</span>
				<span class='text'>49</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; For many years she used Tom's birthday (November 8) as her own</span>
				<span class='text'>It was not until her 1991 autobiography, ''Me: Stories of My Life,'' that Hepburn revealed her true birth date</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Chandler (2011) p</span>
				<span class='text'>7</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In 1924 Hepburn gained a place at [[Bryn Mawr College]]</span>
				<span class='text'>She attended the institution primarily to satisfy her mother, who had studied there, and recalled disliking the experience</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kanin (1971) p</span>
				<span class='text'>285</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time she had been in school for several years, and she was self-conscious and uncomfortable with her classmates</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hepburn (1991) p</span>
				<span class='text'>69</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; She struggled with the scholastic demands of university, and once was suspended for smoking in her room</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Hepburn was drawn to acting, but roles in college plays were conditional on good grades</span>
				<span class='text'>Once her marks had improved, she began performing regularly</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;dickens 4&quot;/&gt; She performed the lead role in a production of ''[[The Woman in the Moon]]'' in her senior year, and the positive response it received cemented Hepburn's plans to pursue a theatrical career</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;higham p 9&quot;/&gt; She was immediately fired, and the original leading lady rehired</span>
				<span class='text'>Undeterred, Hepburn joined forces with the producer [[Arthur Hopkins]] and accepted the role of a schoolgirl in ''These Days''</span>
				<span class='text'>Her Broadway debut came on November 12, 1928, at the [[Cort Theatre]], but reviews for the show were poor and it closed after eight nights</span>

				<span class='text'>In ''[[Mary of Scotland (film)|Mary of Scotland]]'' (1936), one of a series of unsuccessful films Hepburn made in this period</span>
				<span class='text'>]After the failure of ''Spitfire'' and ''The Lake'', RKO cast Hepburn in ''[[The Little Minister (1934 film)|The Little Minister]]'' (1934), based on a Victorian novel by [[James Barrie]], in an attempt to repeat the success of ''Little Women''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Berg (2004) p</span>
				<span class='text'>105</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; There was no such recurrence, and the picture was a commercial failure</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Higham (2004) p</span>
				<span class='text'>66</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The romantic drama ''[[Break of Hearts]]'' (1935) with [[Charles Boyer]] was poorly reviewed and also lost money</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Berg (2004) p</span>
				<span class='text'>106</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; After three forgettable films, success returned to Hepburn with ''[[Alice Adams (film)|Alice Adams]]'' (1935), the story of a girl's desperation to climb the social ladder</span>
				<span class='text'>Hepburn loved [[Alice Adams (novel)|the book]] and was delighted to be offered the role</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Higham (2004) p</span>
				<span class='text'>68</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The film was a hit, one of Hepburn's personal favorites, and gave the actress her second Oscar nomination</span>
				<span class='text'>She received the second most votes, after winner [[Bette Davis]]</span>

				<span class='text'>109</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Given the choice of her next feature, Hepburn decided to star in George Cukor's new project, ''[[Sylvia Scarlett]]'' (1935), which paired her for the first time with [[Cary Grant]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Berg p 109&quot;/&gt; Her hair was cut short for the part, as her character masquerades as a boy for much of the film</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Berg (2004) p</span>
				<span class='text'>110</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; She next played [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary Stuart]] in [[John Ford]]'s ''[[Mary of Scotland (film)|Mary of Scotland]]'' (1936), which met with a similarly poor reception</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Berg (2004) pp</span>
				<span class='text'>111–112</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; ''[[A Woman Rebels]]'' (1936) followed, a Victorian era drama where Hepburn's character defied convention by having a child out of wedlock</span>

				<span class='text'>126</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Quality Street (film)|Quality Street]]'' (1937) also had a period setting, this time a comedy</span>
				<span class='text'>Neither movie was popular with the public, which meant she had made four unsuccessful pictures in a row</span>

				<span class='text'>116</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Hepburn was praised for her work at early previews, which gave her top billing over Rogers</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The film was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] at the Academy Awards, but it was not the box-office hit RKO had hoped for</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Berg p 116&quot;/&gt; Industry pundits blamed Hepburn for the small profit, but the studio continued its commitment to resurrecting her popularity</span>

				<span class='text'>She approached the physical comedy of the film with confidence,&lt;ref name=&quot;Berg p 117&quot;/&gt; and took tips on comedic timing from her costar [[Walter Catlett]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; With the genre and Grant both hugely popular at the time, biographer [[A</span>

				<span class='text'>201</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Many actors were afraid to leave the stability of the [[studio system]] at the time, but Hepburn's personal wealth meant she could afford to be independent</span>
