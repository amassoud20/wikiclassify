				<span class='text'>The first son of [[Henry III of England|Henry&amp;nbsp;III]], Edward was involved early in the political intrigues of his father's reign, which included an outright rebellion by the English barons</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1259, he briefly sided with a baronial reform movement, supporting the [[Provisions of Oxford]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After reconciliation with his father, however, he remained loyal throughout the subsequent armed conflict, known as the [[Second Barons' War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After the [[Battle of Lewes]], Edward was hostage to the rebellious barons, but escaped after a few months and joined the fight against [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Montfort was defeated at the [[Battle of Evesham]] in 1265, and within two years the rebellion was extinguished</span>
				<span class='text'>With England pacified, Edward joined the [[Ninth Crusade]] to the [[Holy Land]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The crusade accomplished little, and Edward was on his way home in 1272 when he was informed that his father had died</span>
				<span class='text'>Making a slow return, he reached England in 1274 and was crowned at Westminster on 19&amp;nbsp;August</span>
				<span class='text'>e spent much of his reign reforming royal administration and [[common law]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Through an extensive legal inquiry, Edward investigated the tenure of various [[feudal]] liberties, while the law was reformed through a series of [[statute]]s regulating criminal and property law</span>
				<span class='text'>Increasingly, however, Edward's attention was drawn towards military affairs</span>
				<span class='text'>After suppressing a minor rebellion in Wales in 1276–77, Edward responded to a second rebellion in 1282–83 with a [[Conquest of Wales by Edward I|full-scale war of conquest]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After a successful campaign, Edward subjected Wales to English rule, built a series of [[castles]] and towns in the countryside and settled them with English people</span>
				<span class='text'>Next, his efforts were directed towards Scotland</span>
				<span class='text'>Initially invited to arbitrate a succession dispute, Edward claimed feudal [[suzerainty]] over the kingdom</span>
				<span class='text'>In [[First Scottish War of Independence|the war]] that followed, the [[Scottish people|Scots]] persevered, even though the English seemed victorious at several points</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time there were problems at home</span>
				<span class='text'>In the mid-1290s, extensive military campaigns required high levels of taxation, and Edward met with both lay and ecclesiastical opposition</span>
				<span class='text'>These crises were initially averted, but issues remained unsettled</span>
				<span class='text'>When the King died in 1307, he left to his son, [[Edward II of England|Edward&amp;nbsp;II]], an ongoing war with Scotland and many financial and political problems</span>
				<span class='text'>dward I was a tall man for his era, hence the nickname &quot;Longshanks&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He was temperamental, and this, along with his height, made him an intimidating man, and he often instilled fear in his contemporaries</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, he held the respect of his subjects for the way he embodied the medieval ideal of kingship, as a soldier, an administrator and a man of faith</span>
				<span class='text'>Modern historians are divided on their assessment of Edward I: while some have praised him for his contribution to the law and administration, others have criticised him for his uncompromising attitude towards his nobility</span>
				<span class='text'>Currently, Edward&amp;nbsp;I is credited with many accomplishments during his reign, including restoring royal authority after the reign of Henry&amp;nbsp;III, establishing [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] as a permanent institution and thereby also a functional system for raising taxes, and reforming the law through statutes</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time, he is also often criticised for other actions, such as his brutal conduct towards the Scots, and issuing the [[Edict of Expulsion]] in 1290, by which the Jews were expelled from England</span>
				<span class='text'>The Edict remained in effect for the rest of the Middle Ages, and it was over 350 years until it was formally overturned under [[Oliver Cromwell]] in 1656</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Prestwich 1997 6&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry of Almain would remain a close companion of the prince, both through the civil war that followed, and later during the crusade</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=46, 69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward was in the care of Hugh Giffard – father of the future [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]] [[Godfrey Giffard]] – until Bartholomew Pecche took over at Giffard's death in 1246</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;There were concerns about Edward's health as a child, and he fell ill in 1246, 1247, and 1251</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Prestwich 1997 6&quot;/&gt; Nonetheless, he became an imposing man; at 6&amp;nbsp;feet 2&amp;nbsp;inches (1</span>
				<span class='text'>8&amp;nbsp;m) he towered over most of his contemporaries, and hence perhaps his [[epithet]] &quot;Longshanks&quot;, meaning &quot;long legs&quot; or &quot;long shins&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The historian Michael Prestwich states that his &quot;long arms gave him an advantage as a swordsman, long thighs one as a horseman</span>
				<span class='text'>In youth, his curly hair was blond; in maturity it darkened, and in old age it turned white</span>
				<span class='text'>[His features were marred by a drooping left eyelid</span>
				<span class='text'> His speech, despite a lisp, was said to be persuasive</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Prestwich 2007 177&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Prestwich|2007|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;In 1254, English fears of a [[Castile (historical region)|Castilian]] invasion of the English province of [[Gascony]] induced Edward's father to arrange a politically expedient marriage between his fourteen-year-old son and [[Eleanor of Castile|Eleanor]], the half-sister of King [[Alfonso X of Castile]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morris|2009|pp=14–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eleanor and Edward were married on 1&amp;nbsp;November 1254 in the [[Abbey of Santa María la Real de Las Huelgas]] in Castile</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morris|2009|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the marriage agreement, the young prince received grants of land worth 15,000&amp;nbsp;[[Mark (money)|marks]] a year</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the endowments King Henry made were sizeable, they offered Edward little independence</span>
				<span class='text'>He had already received Gascony as early as 1249, but [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester]], had been appointed as royal lieutenant the year before and, consequently, drew its income, so in practice Edward derived neither authority nor revenue from this province</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grant he received in 1254 included most of Ireland, and much land in Wales and England, including the [[Earl of Chester|earldom of Chester]], but the King retained much control over the land in question, particularly in Ireland, so Edward's power was limited there as well, and the King derived most of the income from those lands</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=11–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- The king maintained much control of the land in question, and, particularly in Ireland, Edward’s power was limited</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=11–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;From 1254 to 1257, Edward was under the influence of his mother's relatives, known as the Savoyards,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prestwich|2007 |p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; the most notable of whom was [[Peter II of Savoy|Peter of Savoy]], the queen's uncle</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morris|2009|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1257, Edward increasingly fell in with the Poitevin or [[Lusignan]] faction – the half-brothers of his father Henry&amp;nbsp;III – led by such men as [[William de Valence, 1st Earl of Pembroke|William de Valence]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Henry&amp;nbsp;III's mother [[Isabella of Angoulême]] married [[Hugh X of Lusignan]] after the death of King [[John of England|John]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} This association was significant, because the two groups of privileged foreigners were resented by the established English aristocracy, and they would be at the centre of the ensuing years' baronial reform movement</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prestwich|2007|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were tales of unruly and violent conduct by Edward and his Lusignan kinsmen, which raised questions about the royal heir's personal qualities</span>
				<span class='text'>The next years would be formative on Edward's character</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;===Early ambitions===Edward had shown independence in political matters as early as 1255, when he sided with the Soler family in Gascony, in the ongoing conflict between the Soler and Colomb families</span>
				<span class='text'>This ran contrary to his father's policy of mediation between the local factions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1258, a group of [[magnate]]s drew up a document for reform of the King’s government – the so-called [[Provisions of Oxford]] – largely directed against the Lusignans</span>
				<span class='text'>Edward stood by his political allies and strongly opposed the Provisions</span>
				<span class='text'>The reform movement succeeded in limiting the Lusignan influence, however, and gradually Edward's attitude started to change</span>
				<span class='text'>In March 1259, he entered into a formal alliance with one of the main reformers, [[Richard de Clare, 5th Earl of Hertford|Richard de Clare, Earl of Gloucester]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Then, on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1259, he announced that he supported the barons' goals, and their leader, Simon de Montfort</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carpenter|first=David|year=1985|title=The Lord Edward's oath to aid and counsel Simon de Montfort, 15&amp;nbsp;October 1259|journal=Bulletin of the Institute of Historical Research|volume=58|pages=226–37|doi=10</span>

				<span class='text'>985</span>
				<span class='text'>b01170</span>
				<span class='text'>}}&lt;/ref&gt;The motive behind Edward's change of heart could have been purely pragmatic; Montfort was in a good position to support his cause in Gascony</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the King left for France in November, Edward's behaviour turned into pure insubordination</span>
				<span class='text'>He made several appointments to advance the cause of the reformers, causing his father to believe that his son was considering a coup d'état</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the King returned from France, he initially refused to see his son, but through the mediation of the Earl of Cornwall and the [[Boniface of Savoy (archbishop)|archbishop of Canterbury]], the two were eventually reconciled</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morris|2009|pp=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward was sent abroad, and in November 1260 he again united with the Lusignans, who had been exiled to France</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;Back in England, early in 1262, Edward fell out with some of his former Lusignan allies over financial matters</span>
				<span class='text'>The next year, King Henry sent him on a campaign in Wales against [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]], with only limited results</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Powicke|1962|pp=171–172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, Simon de Montfort, who had been out of the country since 1261, returned to England and reignited the baronial reform movement</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Maddicott|1994|p=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was at this pivotal moment, as the King seemed ready to resign to the barons' demands, that Edward began to take control of the situation</span>
				<span class='text'>Whereas he had so far been unpredictable and equivocating, from this point on he remained firmly devoted to protecting his father's royal rights</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Powicke|1962|pp=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reunited with some of the men he had alienated the year before – among them his childhood friend, Henry of Almain, and [[John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey|John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey]] – and retook [[Windsor Castle]] from the rebels</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the arbitration of King [[Louis IX of France|Louis&amp;nbsp;IX of France]], an agreement was made between the two parties</span>
				<span class='text'>This so-called [[Mise of Amiens]] was largely favourable to the royalist side, and laid the seeds for further conflict</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prestwich|2007|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;==Civil war and crusades, 1264–73=====Second Barons' War==={{main|Second Barons' War}}The years 1264–1267 saw the conflict known as the [[Second Barons' War]], in which baronial forces led by Simon de Montfort fought against those who remained loyal to the King</span>
				<span class='text'>The first scene of battle was the city of [[Gloucester]], which Edward managed to retake from the enemy</span>
				<span class='text'>When [[Robert de Ferrers, 6th Earl of Derby|Robert de Ferrers, Earl of Derby]], came to the assistance of the rebels, Edward negotiated a truce with the earl, the terms of which he later broke</span>
				<span class='text'>Edward then captured [[Northampton]] from Montfort's son [[Simon VI de Montfort|Simon]], before embarking on a retaliatory campaign against Derby's lands</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The baronial and royalist forces finally met at the [[Battle of Lewes]], on 14&amp;nbsp;May 1264</span>
				<span class='text'>Edward, commanding the right wing, performed well, and soon defeated the London contingent of Montfort's forces</span>
				<span class='text'>Unwisely, however, he followed the scattered enemy in pursuit, and on his return found the rest of the royal army defeated</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sadler|2008|pp=55–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the agreement known as the [[Mise of Lewes]], Edward and his cousin Henry of Almain were given up as hostages to Montfort</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Powicke|1962|pp=201–202}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two forces then met at the second great encounter of the Barons' War, the [[Battle of Evesham]], on 4&amp;nbsp;August 1265</span>
				<span class='text'>Montfort stood little chance against the superior royal forces, and after his defeat he was killed and mutilated on the field</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sadler|2008|pp=105–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;Through such episodes as the deception of Derby at Gloucester, Edward acquired a reputation as untrustworthy</span>
				<span class='text'>During the summer campaign, though, he began to learn from his mistakes, and acted in a way that gained the respect and admiration of his contemporaries</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morris|2009|pp=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; The war did not end with Montfort's death, and Edward participated in the continued campaigning</span>
				<span class='text'>At Christmas, he came to terms with the younger Simon de Montfort and his associates at the [[Isle of Axholme]] in Lincolnshire, and in March he led a successful assault on the [[Cinque Ports]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morris|2009|pp=83, 90–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the country pacified, the greatest impediment to the project was providing sufficient finances</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Maddicott|1989|pp=107–110}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20&amp;nbsp;August Edward sailed from [[Dover]] for France</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morris|2009|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians have not determined the size of the force with any certainty, but Edward probably brought with him around 225&amp;nbsp;knights and altogether less than 1000&amp;nbsp;men</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;P71&quot;/&gt;Originally, the Crusaders intended to relieve the beleaguered Christian stronghold of [[Acre (Israel)|Acre]], but Louis had been diverted to [[Tunis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The French King and his brother [[Charles I of Naples|Charles of Anjou]], who had made himself [[List of monarchs of Sicily|King of Sicily]], decided to attack the emirate to establish a stronghold in North Africa</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;P73&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plans failed when the French forces were struck by an epidemic which, on 25&amp;nbsp;August, took the life of King Louis himself</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;The disease in question was either [[dysentery]] or [[typhus]]; {{Harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|pp=210–211}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time Edward arrived at Tunis, Charles had already signed a treaty with the emir, and there was little else to do but return to Sicily</span>
				<span class='text'>The crusade was postponed until next spring, but a devastating storm off the coast of Sicily dissuaded Charles of Anjou and Louis's successor [[Philip III of France|Philip III]] from any further campaigning</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward decided to continue alone, and on 9&amp;nbsp;May 1271&amp;nbsp;he finally landed at Acre</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;By then, the situation in the [[Holy Land]] was a precarious one</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Jerusalem]] had fallen in 1244, and Acre was now the centre of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Christian state]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morris|2009|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Muslim states were on the offensive under the [[Bahri dynasty|Mamluk]] leadership of [[Baibars]], and were now threatening Acre itself</span>
				<span class='text'>Though Edward's men were an important addition to the garrison, they stood little chance against Baibars' superior forces, and an initial raid at nearby St Georges-de-Lebeyne in June was largely futile</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morris|2009|pp=97–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, Edward led a raid on [[Qaqun]], which could have served as a bridgehead to Jerusalem, but both the Mongol invasion and the attack on Qaqun failed</span>
				<span class='text'>Things now seemed increasingly desperate, and in May 1272&amp;nbsp;[[Hugh III of Cyprus]], who was the nominal [[Kings of Jerusalem|king of Jerusalem]], signed a ten-year truce with Baibars</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward was initially defiant, but an attack by a Muslim [[assassination|assassin]] in June forced him to abandon any further campaigning</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he managed to kill the assassin, he was struck in the arm by a dagger feared to be poisoned, and became severely weakened over the following months</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=78, 82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward was deeply saddened by this news, but rather than hurrying home at once, he made a leisurely journey northwards</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; The political situation in England was stable after the mid-century upheavals, and Edward was proclaimed king at his father's death, rather than at his own coronation, as had until then been customary</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing ongoing hostilities and the English king's harbouring of his enemies, Llywelyn refused to do homage to Edward</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Davies|2000|p=327}}&lt;/ref&gt;In November 1276, war was declared</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Powicke|1962|p=413}}&lt;/ref&gt;When war broke out again in 1282, it was an entirely different undertaking</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; The war started with a rebellion by Dafydd, who was discontented with the reward he had received from Edward in 1277</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Davies|2000|p=348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Llywelyn and other Welsh chieftains soon joined in, and initially the Welsh experienced military success</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morris|2009|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6&amp;nbsp;November, while [[John Peckham]], [[archbishop of Canterbury]], was conducting peace negotiations, Edward's commander of [[Anglesey]], [[Luke de Tany]], decided to carry out a surprise attack</span>
				<span class='text'>A [[pontoon bridge]] had been built to the mainland, but shortly after Tany and his men crossed over, they were ambushed by the Welsh and suffered heavy losses at the [[Battle of Moel-y-don]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Davies|2000|p=353}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conquest of Gwynedd was complete with the capture in June 1283 of Dafydd, who was taken to [[Shrewsbury]] and executed as a traitor the following autumn</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=510}}&lt;/ref&gt;Further rebellions occurred in 1287–88 and, more seriously, in 1294, under the leadership of [[Madog ap Llywelyn]], a distant relative of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=218–220}}&lt;/ref&gt; This last conflict demanded the King's own attention, but in both cases the rebellions were put down</span>
				<span class='text'>===Colonisation===={{See also|Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd}}By the 1284 [[Statute of Rhuddlan]], the [[Principality of Wales]] was incorporated into England and was given an administrative system like the English, with counties policed by sheriffs</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=511}}&lt;/ref&gt; English law was introduced in criminal cases, though the Welsh were allowed to maintain their own customary laws in some cases of property disputes</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Davies|2000|p=368}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1277, and increasingly after 1283, Edward embarked on a full-scale project of English settlement of Wales, creating new towns like [[Flint, Flintshire|Flint]], [[Aberystwyth]] and [[Rhuddlan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their new residents were English migrants, with the local Welsh banned from living inside them, and many were protected by extensive walls</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lilley|2010|pp=104–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;An extensive project of castle-building was also initiated, under the direction of Master [[James of Saint George]], a prestigious architect whom Edward had met in [[Savoy]] on his return from the crusade</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coldstream|2010|pp=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; These included the castles of [[Beaumaris Castle|Beaumaris]], [[Caernarfon Castle|Caernarfon]], [[Conwy Castle|Conwy]] and [[Harlech Castle|Harlech]], intended to act both as fortresses and royal palaces for the King</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=160}}; {{harvnb|Brears|2010|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; His programme of castle building in Wales heralded the introduction of the widespread use of [[arrowslit]]s in castle walls across Europe, drawing on Eastern influences</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cathcart King|1988|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also a product of the Crusades was the introduction of the [[concentric castle]], and four of the eight castles Edward founded in Wales followed this design</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cathcart King|1988|p=83}}; {{Harvnb|Friar|2003|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; The castles made a clear, imperial statement about Edward's intentions to rule North Wales permanently, and drew on imagery associated with the [[Byzantium|Byzantine]] [[Roman Empire]] and [[King Arthur]] in an attempt to build legitimacy for his new regime</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prestwich|2010|p=6}}; {{harvnb|Wheatley|2010|pp=129, 136}}&lt;/ref&gt;In 1284, King Edward had his son Edward (later [[Edward II of England|Edward&amp;nbsp;II]]) born at Caernarfon Castle, probably to make a deliberate statement about the new political order in Wales</span>

				<span class='text'>As [[Duke of Aquitaine]], Edward was a [[vassal]] of the French king</span>
				<span class='text'>]Edward never again went on crusade after his return to England in 1274, but he maintained an intention to do so, and took the cross again in 1287</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=326–328}}&lt;/ref&gt; This intention guided much of his foreign policy, until at least 1291</span>
				<span class='text'>To stage a European-wide crusade, it was essential to prevent conflict between the greater princes on the continent</span>
				<span class='text'>A major obstacle to this was represented by the conflict between the French [[Capetian House of Anjou|House of Anjou]] ruling southern Italy, and the [[kingdom of Aragon]] in Spain</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1282, the citizens of Palermo rose up against [[Charles I of Naples|Charles of Anjou]] and turned for help to [[Peter III of Aragon|Peter of Aragon]], in what has become known as the [[Sicilian Vespers]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In the war that followed, Charles of Anjou's son, [[Charles II of Naples|Charles of Salerno]], was taken prisoner by the Aragonese</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Powicke|1962|pp=252–253}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French began planning an attack on Aragon, raising the prospect of a large-scale European war</span>
				<span class='text'>To Edward, it was imperative that such a war be avoided, and in Paris in 1286 he brokered a truce between France and Aragon that helped secure Charles' release</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=323–325}}&lt;/ref&gt; As far as the crusades were concerned, however, Edward's efforts proved ineffective</span>
				<span class='text'>A devastating blow to his plans came in 1291, when the Mamluks [[Siege of Acre (1291)|captured Acre]], the last Christian stronghold in the Holy Land</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=329}}&lt;/ref&gt;After the fall of Acre, Edward's international role changed from that of a diplomat to an antagonist</span>
				<span class='text'>He had long been deeply involved in the affairs of his own [[Duchy of Gascony]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1278 he assigned an investigating commission to his trusted associates [[Otton de Grandson|Otto de Grandson]] and the chancellor Robert Burnell, which caused the replacement of the seneschal [[Luke de Tany]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=304}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1286, Edward visited the region himself and stayed for almost three years</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morris|2009|pp=204–217}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perennial problem, however, was the status of Gascony within the kingdom of France, and Edward's role as the French king's vassal</span>
				<span class='text'>On his diplomatic mission in 1286, Edward had paid homage to the new king, [[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]], but in 1294 Philip declared Gascony forfeit when Edward refused to appear before him in Paris to discuss the recent conflict between English, Gascon, and French sailors (that had resulted in several French ships being captured, along with the sacking of the French port of [[La Rochelle]])</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morris|2009|pp=265–270}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Eleanor of Castile]] had died on 28&amp;nbsp;November 1290</span>
				<span class='text'>Uncommon for such marriages of the period, the couple loved each other</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, like his father, Edward was very devoted to his wife and was faithful to her throughout their married lives — a rarity among monarchs of the time</span>
				<span class='text'>He was deeply affected by her death</span>
				<span class='text'>He displayed his grief by erecting twelve so-called [[Eleanor cross]]es, one at each place where her funeral cortège stopped for the night</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morris|2009|pp=230–231}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the peace accord between England and France in 1294, it was agreed that Edward should marry [[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]]'s half-sister [[Margaret of France (died 1318)|Margaret]], but the marriage was delayed by the outbreak of war</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=357}}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems arose only with the Scottish succession crisis of the early 1290s</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown|1989|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; The representation of commons in Parliament was nothing new; what was new was the authority under which these representatives were summoned</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harriss|1975|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fiscal demands on the King's subjects caused resentment, and this resentment eventually led to serious political opposition</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barrow|1965|pp=123–126}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defeat sent shockwaves into England, and preparations for a retaliatory campaign started immediately</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=479}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward, however, was not able to take advantage of the momentum, and the next year the Scots managed to recapture [[Stirling Castle]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prestwich|2007|p=233}}&lt;/ref&gt;The defeated Scots, secretly urged on by the French, appealed to the pope to assert a claim of overlordship to Scotland in place of the English</span>

				<span class='text'>The English managed to subdue the country by other means, however</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Powicke|1962|pp=709–711}}&lt;/ref&gt; A great propaganda victory was achieved in 1305 when Wallace was betrayed by Sir [[John de Menteith]] and turned over to the English, who had him taken to London where he was publicly executed</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barrow|1965|pp=206–207, 212–213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce now embarked on a campaign to restore Scottish independence, and this campaign took the English by surprise</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=506–507}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English initially met with success; on 19&amp;nbsp;June, Aymer de Valence routed Bruce at the [[Battle of Methven]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=507–508}}&lt;/ref&gt;Edward responded with severe brutality against Bruce's allies and supporters</span>
