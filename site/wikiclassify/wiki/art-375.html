				<span class='text'>Under Jolly's supervision, Planck performed the only experiments of his scientific career, studying the [[diffusion]] of [[hydrogen]] through heated [[platinum]], but transferred to [[theoretical physics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1877 he went to the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich Wilhelms University]] in Berlin for a year of study with physicists [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] and [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] and mathematician [[Karl Weierstrass]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote that Helmholtz was never quite prepared, spoke slowly, miscalculated endlessly, and bored his listeners, while Kirchhoff spoke in carefully prepared lectures which were dry and monotonous</span>
				<span class='text'>He soon became close friends with Helmholtz</span>
				<span class='text'>While there he undertook a program of mostly self-study of [[Rudolf Clausius|Clausius's]] writings, which led him to choose heat theory as his field</span>

				<span class='text'>He briefly taught mathematics and physics at his former school in Munich</span>
				<span class='text'>n June 1880, he presented his [[habilitation]] thesis, ''Gleichgewichtszustände isotroper Körper in verschiedenen Temperaturen'' (''Equilibrium states of isotropic bodies at different temperatures'')</span>
				<span class='text'>==Academic career===With the completion of his habilitation thesis, Planck became an unpaid private lecturer ([[Privatdozent]]) in Munich, waiting until he was offered an academic position</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he was initially ignored by the academic community, he furthered his work on the field of [[theory of heat|heat theory]] and discovered one after another the same [[Thermodynamics|thermodynamic]]al formalism as [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|Gibbs]] without realizing it</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;]]Planck started a six-semester course of lectures on theoretical physics, &quot;dry, somewhat impersonal&quot; according to [[Lise Meitner]], &quot;using no notes, never making mistakes, never faltering; the best lecturer I ever heard&quot; according to an English participant, [[J</span>

				<span class='text'>As the lecture-room was well heated and rather close, some of the listeners would from time to time drop to the floor, but this did not disturb the lecture&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Planck did not establish an actual &quot;school&quot;; the number of his graduate students was only about 20, among them::1897 [[Max Abraham]] (1875–1922):1904 [[Moritz Schlick]] (1882–1936):1906 [[Walther Meissner]] (1882–1974):1906 [[Max von Laue]] (1879–1960):1907 [[Fritz Reiche]] (1883–1960):1912 [[Walter Schottky]] (1886–1976):1914 [[Walther Bothe]] (1891–1957)===Black-body radiation===In 1894 Planck turned his attention to the problem of [[black-body radiation]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He had been commissioned by electric companies to create maximum light from [[lightbulb]]s with minimum energy</span>
				<span class='text'>The problem had been stated by Kirchhoff in 1859: &quot;how does the intensity of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a [[black body]] (a perfect absorber, also known as a cavity radiator) depend on the [[frequency]] of the radiation (i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> the color of the light) and the temperature of the body?&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The question had been explored experimentally, but no theoretical treatment agreed with experimental values</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Wilhelm Wien]] proposed [[Wien approximation|Wien's law]], which correctly predicted the behaviour at high frequencies, but failed at low frequencies</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Rayleigh–Jeans law]], another approach to the problem, created what was later known as the &quot;[[ultraviolet catastrophe]]&quot;, but contrary to many textbooks this was not a motivation for Planck</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Kragh&quot;&gt;For a solid approach to the complexity of Planck's intellectual motivations for the quantum, for his reluctant acceptance of its implications, see Helge Kragh, [http://physicsworld</span>
				<span class='text'>om/cws/article/print/373 Max Planck: the reluctant revolutionary], ''Physics World''</span>
				<span class='text'>December 2000</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Planck's first proposed solution to the problem in 1899 followed from what Planck called the &quot;principle of elementary disorder&quot;, which allowed him to derive Wien's law from a number of assumptions about the entropy of an ideal oscillator, creating what was referred-to as the [[Wien–Planck law]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon it was found that experimental evidence did not confirm the new law at all, to Planck's frustration</span>
				<span class='text'>Planck revised his approach, deriving the first version of the famous [[Planck's law of black-body radiation|Planck black-body radiation law]], which described the experimentally observed black-body spectrum well</span>
				<span class='text'>It was first proposed in a meeting of the DPG on 19 October 1900 and published in 1901</span>
				<span class='text'>This first derivation did not include energy quantisation, and did not use [[statistical mechanics]], to which he held an aversion</span>
				<span class='text'>In November 1900, Planck revised this first approach, relying on [[Ludwig Boltzmann|Boltzmann]]'s statistical interpretation of the [[second law of thermodynamics]] as a way of gaining a more fundamental understanding of the principles behind his radiation law</span>
				<span class='text'>As Planck was deeply suspicious of the philosophical and physical implications of such an interpretation of Boltzmann's approach, his recourse to them was, as he later put it, &quot;an act of despair </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>I was ready to sacrifice any of my previous convictions about physics</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kragh&quot;/&gt;The central assumption behind his new derivation, presented to the DPG on 14 December 1900, was the supposition, now known as the [[Planck postulate]], that electromagnetic energy could be emitted only in [[Quantization (physics)|quantized]] form, in other words, the energy could only be a multiple of an elementary unit &lt;math&gt;E = h \nu&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is [[Planck's constant]], also known as Planck's action quantum (introduced already in 1899), and &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; (the Greek letter ''nu'', not the Roman letter ''v'') is the frequency of the radiation</span>
				<span class='text'>Note that the elementary units of energy discussed here are represented by &lt;math&gt;h \nu&lt;/math&gt; and not simply by &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'>Physicists now call these quanta photons, and a photon of frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; will have its own specific and unique energy</span>
				<span class='text'>The total energy at that frequency is then equal to  &lt;math&gt;h \nu&lt;/math&gt; multiplied by the number of photons at that frequency</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|Planck in 1918, the year he received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for his work on [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]]]]At first Planck considered that quantisation was only &quot;a purely formal assumption </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>actually I did not think much about it</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot;; nowadays this assumption, incompatible with [[classical physics]], is regarded as the birth of [[quantum physics]] and the greatest intellectual accomplishment of Planck's career ([[Ludwig Boltzmann]] had been discussing in a theoretical paper in 1877 the possibility that the energy states of a physical system could be discrete)</span>
				<span class='text'>The discovery of Planck's constant enabled him to define a new universal set of physical units (such as the Planck length and the Planck mass), all based on fundamental physical constants upon which much of quantum theory is based</span>
				<span class='text'>In recognition of Planck's fundamental contribution to a new branch of physics, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kragh, Helge (1 December 2000), Max Planck: the reluctant revolutionary, PhysicsWorld</span>
				<span class='text'>om&lt;/ref&gt;Subsequently, Planck tried to grasp the meaning of energy quanta, but to no avail</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;My unavailing attempts to somehow reintegrate the action quantum into classical theory extended over several years and caused me much trouble</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Even several years later, other physicists like [[John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Rayleigh]], [[James Jeans|Jeans]], and [[Hendrik Lorentz|Lorentz]] set Planck's constant to zero in order to align with classical physics, but Planck knew well that this constant had a precise nonzero value</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;I am unable to understand Jeans' stubbornness – he is an example of a theoretician as should never be existing, the same as [[Hegel]] was for philosophy</span>

				<span class='text'>Planck was among the few who immediately recognized the significance of the [[special theory of relativity]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Thanks to his influence, this theory was soon widely accepted in Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>Planck also contributed considerably to extend the special theory of relativity</span>

				<span class='text'>He was unwilling to discard completely [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s theory of [[electrodynamics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;The theory of light would be thrown back not by decades, but by centuries, into the age when [[Christian Huygens]] dared to fight against the mighty emission theory of [[Isaac Newton]] </span>

				<span class='text'>quot;{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}In 1910, Einstein pointed out the anomalous behavior of [[specific heat]] at low temperatures as another example of a phenomenon which defies explanation by classical physics</span>
				<span class='text'>Planck and [[Walther Nernst|Nernst]], seeking to clarify the increasing number of contradictions, organized the First [[Solvay Conference]] (Brussels 1911)</span>
				<span class='text'>At this meeting Einstein was able to convince Planck</span>

				<span class='text'>Soon the two scientists became close friends and met frequently to play music together</span>
				<span class='text'>==World War I===At the onset of the [[First World War]] Planck endorsed the general excitement of the public, writing that, &quot;Besides much that is horrible, there is also much that is unexpectedly great and beautiful: the smooth solution of the most difficult domestic political problems by the unification of all parties (and) </span>

				<span class='text'>In 1915, at a time when Italy was about to join the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]], he voted successfully for a scientific paper from Italy, which received a prize from the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]], where Planck was one of four permanent presidents</span>
				<span class='text'>lanck also signed the infamous &quot;[[Manifesto of the Ninety-Three|Manifesto of the 93 intellectuals]]&quot;, a pamphlet of polemic war propaganda (while Einstein retained a strictly pacifistic attitude which almost led to his imprisonment, being spared by his [[Swiss (people)|Swiss]] citizenship)</span>
				<span class='text'>But in 1915 Planck, after several meetings with Dutch physicist [[Hendrik Lorentz|Lorentz]], revoked parts of the Manifesto</span>
				<span class='text'>Then in 1916 he signed a declaration against German [[annexationism]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Planck expected that [[Schrödinger equation#Particles as waves|wave mechanics]] would soon render quantum theory—his own child—unnecessary</span>
				<span class='text'>This was not to be the case, however</span>
				<span class='text'>Further work only cemented quantum theory, even against his and Einstein's philosophical revulsions</span>
				<span class='text'>Planck experienced the truth of his own earlier observation from his struggle with the older views in his younger years: &quot;A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it</span>

				<span class='text'>He witnessed many Jewish friends and colleagues expelled from their positions and humiliated, and hundreds of scientists emigrated from [[Nazi Germany]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Again he tried to &quot;persevere and continue working&quot; and asked scientists who were considering emigration to remain in Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>He hoped the crisis would abate soon and the political situation would improve</span>
				<span class='text'>[Otto Hahn]] asked Planck to gather well-known German professors in order to issue a public proclamation against the treatment of Jewish professors, but Planck replied, &quot;If you are able to gather today 30 such gentlemen, then tomorrow 150 others will come and speak against it, because they are eager to take over the positions of the others</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;In a slightly different translation, Hahn remembers Planck saying:  &quot;If you bring together 30 such men today, then tomorrow 150 will come to denounce them because they want to take their places</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Under Planck's leadership, the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Society]] (KWG) avoided open conflict with the Nazi regime, except concerning [[Fritz Haber]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Planck tried to discuss the issue with [[Adolf Hitler]] but was unsuccessful</span>
				<span class='text'>In the following year, 1934, Haber died in exile</span>
				<span class='text'>ne year later, Planck, having been the president of the KWG since 1930, organized in a somewhat provocative style an official commemorative meeting for Haber</span>
				<span class='text'>He also succeeded in secretly enabling a number of Jewish scientists to continue working in institutes of the KWG for several years</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1936, his term as president of the KWG ended, and the Nazi government pressured him to refrain from seeking another term</span>
				<span class='text'>s the political climate in Germany gradually became more hostile, [[Johannes Stark]], prominent exponent of [[Deutsche Physik]] (&quot;German Physics&quot;, also called &quot;Aryan Physics&quot;) attacked Planck, [[Arnold Sommerfeld|Sommerfeld]] and Heisenberg for continuing to teach the theories of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], calling them &quot;white Jews&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The &quot;Hauptamt Wissenschaft&quot; (Nazi government office for science) started an investigation of Planck's ancestry, claiming that he was &quot;1/16 Jewish&quot;; however, Planck himself denied this</span>
