				<span class='text'>This was the first time a computer had ever defeated a world champion in match play</span>

				<span class='text'>asparov claimed that several factors weighed against him in this match</span>
				<span class='text'>In particular, he was denied access to Deep Blue's recent games, in contrast to the computer's team, which could study hundreds of Kasparov's</span>
				<span class='text'>fter the loss Kasparov said that he sometimes saw deep intelligence and creativity in the machine's moves, suggesting that during the second game, human chess players, in contravention of the rules, intervened</span>
				<span class='text'>IBM denied that it cheated, saying the only human intervention occurred between games</span>
				<span class='text'>The rules provided for the developers to modify the program between games, an opportunity they said they used to shore up weaknesses in the computer's play revealed during the course of the match</span>
				<span class='text'>Kasparov requested printouts of the machine's log files but IBM refused, although the company later published the logs on the Internet</span>
