				<span class='text'>After he contracted [[tuberculosis]] in 1930, he had to end his [[Association football|football]] activities; he had been a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for a prominent Algerian university team</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, he was only able to study part-time</span>
				<span class='text'>To earn money, he took odd jobs: as a private tutor, car parts clerk, and assistant at the [[Meteorological]] Institute</span>
				<span class='text'>He completed his ''licence de philosophie'' ([[Bachelor of Arts|BA]]) in 1936; in May 1936, he successfully presented his thesis on [[Plotinus]], ''Néo-Platonisme et Pensée Chrétienne'' (Neo-Platonism and Christian Thought), for his ''diplôme d'études supérieures'' (roughly equivalent to an [[Master of Arts|MA]] thesis)</span>
				<span class='text'>{{French literature sidebar}}Camus joined the [[French Communist Party]] in the spring of 1935, seeing it as a way to &quot;fight inequalities between Europeans and 'natives' in Algeria</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He did not suggest he was a Marxist or that he had read ''Das Kapital'', but did write, &quot;We might see communism as a springboard and asceticism that prepares the ground for more spiritual activities</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Todd&quot; /&gt; In 1936, the independence-minded [[Algerian Communist Party]] (PCA) was founded</span>
				<span class='text'>Camus joined the activities of the [[Algerian People's Party]] (''Le Parti du Peuple Algérien''), which got him into trouble with his Communist party comrades, who in 1937 denounced him as a [[Trotskyism|Trotskyite]] and expelled from the party</span>
				<span class='text'>Camus then became associated with the French [[anarchism|anarchist]] movement</span>
				<span class='text'>he anarchist [[André Prudhommeaux]] first introduced him at a meeting in 1948 of the ''Cercle des Étudiants Anarchistes'' (Anarchist Student Circle) as a sympathiser familiar with anarchist thought</span>
				<span class='text'>Camus wrote for anarchist publications such as ''Le Libertaire'', ''La révolution Proletarienne'', and ''[[Solidaridad Obrera (periodical)|Solidaridad Obrera]]'' (Workers' Solidarity), the organ of the [[anarcho-syndicalist]] [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] (National Confederation of Labor)</span>

				<span class='text'>His work included a report on the poor conditions for peasants in [[Kabylie]], which apparently cost him his job</span>
				<span class='text'>From 1939 to 1940, he briefly wrote for a similar paper, ''Soir-Republicain''</span>
				<span class='text'>He was rejected by the French army because of his [[tuberculosis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1940, Camus married [[Francine Faure]], a pianist and mathematician</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he loved her, he had argued passionately against the institution of marriage, dismissing it as unnatural</span>

				<span class='text'>Any football  ambitions disappeared when he contracted tuberculosis at the age of 17</span>
				<span class='text'>The affliction, which was then incurable, caused Camus to be bedridden for long and painful periods</span>
				<span class='text'>hen Camus was asked in the 1950s by an alumni sports magazine for a few words regarding his time with the RUA, his response included the following:&lt;blockquote&gt;After many years during which I saw many things, what I know most surely about morality and the duty of man I owe to sport and learned it in the RUA</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;rhybma&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Camus was referring to a sort of simplistic morality he wrote about in his early essays, the principle of sticking up for your friends, of valuing bravery and fair-play</span>
				<span class='text'>Camus's belief was that political and religious authorities try to confuse us with over-complicated moral systems to make things appear more complex than they really are, potentially to serve their own needs</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;rhybma&quot; /&gt;A professional footballer appears as a character in ''The Plague'' and football is discussed in the dialogue</span>
				<span class='text'>==Revolutionary Union Movement and Europe===As he wrote in [[The Rebel (book)|''L'Homme révolté'']] (''The Rebel''), in the chapter about &quot;The Thought on Midday&quot;, Camus was a follower of the ancient Greek 'Solar Tradition' (la ''pensée solaire'')</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1947–48, he founded the Revolutionary Union Movement (''Groupes de liaison internationale'' – GLI)&lt;ref name=&quot;Todd&quot; /&gt; a trade union movement in the context of revolutionary syndicalism (''Syndicalisme révolutionnaire'')</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Olivier Todd, in his biography ''Albert Camus, une vie'', it was a group opposed to some tendencies of the Surrealist movement of André Breton</span>
				<span class='text'>For more, see the book ''Alfred Rosmer et le mouvement révolutionnaire international'' by Christian Gras</span>
				<span class='text'>is colleagues were Nicolas Lazarévitch, [[Louis Mercier]], Roger Lapeyre, Paul Chauvet, Auguste Largentier, Jean de Boë (see the article: &quot;Nicolas Lazarévitch, Itinéraire d'un syndicaliste révolutionnaire&quot; by Sylvain Boulouque in the review ''Communisme'', n° 61, 2000)</span>
				<span class='text'>His main aim was to express the positive side of [[surrealism]] and existentialism, rejecting the negativity and the [[nihilism]] of [[André Breton]]</span>
				<span class='text'>rom 1943, Albert Camus had correspondence with [[Altiero Spinelli]] who founded the [[European Federalist Movement]] in Milan—see [[Ventotene Manifesto]] and the book &quot;Unire l'Europa, superare gli stati&quot;, Altiero Spinelli nel Partito d'Azione del Nord Italia e in Francia dal 1944 al 1945-annexed a letter by Altiero Spinelli to Albert Camus</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1944, Camus founded the &quot;French Committee for the European Federation&quot; (''Comité Français pour la Féderation Européenne'' – CFFE) declaring that Europe &quot;can only evolve along the path of economic progress, democracy and peace if the nation states become a federation</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;From 22 to 25 March 1945, the first conference of the European Federalist Movement was organised in Paris with the participation of Albert Camus, [[George Orwell]], [[Emmanuel Mounier]], [[Lewis Mumford]], [[André Philip]], [[Daniel Mayer]], [[François Bondy]] and [[Altiero Spinelli]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See the book ''The Biography of Europe'' by Pan Drakopoulos</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This specific branch of the [[European Federalist Movement]] disintegrated in 1957 after [[Winston Churchill]]'s ideas about European integration rose to dominance</span>
				<span class='text'>==Death===Camus died on January 4, 1960 at the age of 46, in a car accident near [[Sens]], in Le Grand Fossard in the small town of [[Villeblevin]]</span>

				<span class='text'>wo of Camus's works were published posthumously</span>
				<span class='text'>The first, entitled ''[[A Happy Death]]'' (1970), featured a character named Patrice Mersault, comparable to ''[[The Stranger (novel)|The Stranger]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Meursault</span>
				<span class='text'>There is scholarly debate as to the relationship between the two books</span>
				<span class='text'>The second was an unfinished novel, ''[[The First Man]]'' (1995), which Camus was writing before he died</span>
				<span class='text'>The novel was an autobiographical work about his childhood in [[Algeria]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Literary career==During the war Camus joined the [[French Resistance]] cell ''[[Combat (newspaper)|Combat]]'', which published an underground newspaper of the same name</span>
				<span class='text'>This group worked against the Nazis, and in it Camus assumed the ''[[pseudonym|nom de guerre]]'' ''Beauchard''</span>
				<span class='text'>Camus became the paper's editor in 1943</span>
				<span class='text'>He first met Sartre at the dress rehearsal of Sartre's play, ''[[The Flies]]'', in June 1943</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''{{Ill|fr|The Prime of Life|La Force de l'âge}}'', by [[Simone de Beauvoir]]&lt;/ref&gt;When [[Allies of World War II|the Allies]] [[Liberation of Paris|liberated Paris]] in August 1944, Camus witnessed and reported the last of the fighting</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon after the event on 6 August 1945, he was one of the few French editors to publicly express opposition and disgust to the United States' dropping [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|the atomic bombs on Japan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He resigned from ''Combat'' in 1947 when it became a commercial paper</span>
				<span class='text'>After the war, Camus began frequenting the [[Café de Flore]] on the [[Boulevard Saint-Germain]] in Paris with Sartre and others</span>
				<span class='text'>He also toured the United States to lecture about French thought</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he leaned [[left-wing politics|left]], politically, his strong criticisms of Communist doctrine did not win him any friends in the [[Communist Party|Communist parties]] and eventually alienated Sartre</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1949, his tuberculosis returned, whereupon he lived in seclusion for two years</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1951, he published ''[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]]'', a philosophical analysis of rebellion and revolution which expressed his rejection of communism</span>
				<span class='text'>Upsetting many of his colleagues and contemporaries in France, the book brought about the final split with Sartre</span>
				<span class='text'>The dour reception depressed Camus; he began to translate plays</span>
				<span class='text'>amus's first significant contribution to philosophy was his [[Absurdism|idea of the absurd]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He saw it as the result of our desire for clarity and meaning within a world and condition that offers neither, which he expressed in ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'' and incorporated into many of his other works, such as ''[[The Stranger (novel)|The Stranger]]'' and ''[[The Plague]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite his split from his &quot;study partner&quot;, Sartre, Camus was still categorized as an [[Existentialist]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He specifically rejected that label in his essay &quot;Enigma&quot; and elsewhere</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See: ''The Lyrical and Critical Essays of Albert Camus''&lt;/ref&gt; The current confusion arises, in part, because many recent applications of existentialism have much in common with many of Camus's ''practical'' ideas (see: ''Resistance, Rebellion, and Death'')</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1952, he resigned from his work for [[UNESCO]] when the UN accepted Spain as a member under the leadership of [[Francisco Franco|General Franco]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1953, he criticized [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] methods to crush a workers' strike in [[East Berlin]]</span>

				<span class='text'>It reads: &quot;From the General Council of the Yonne Department, in homage to the writer Albert Camus whose remains lay in vigil at the Villeblevin town hall on the night of 4 to 5 January 1960</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;]]When the [[Algerian War]] began in 1954, Camus was confronted with a moral dilemma</span>
				<span class='text'>He identified with the ''[[Pied-Noir|Pieds-Noirs]]'' such as his own parents and defended the French government's actions against the revolt</span>
				<span class='text'>He argued that the Algerian uprising was an integral part of the 'new Arab imperialism' led by Egypt and an 'anti-Western' offensive orchestrated by Russia to 'encircle Europe' and 'isolate the United States'</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Actuelles III: Chroniques Algeriennes'', 1939–58&lt;/ref&gt; Although favoring greater Algerian [[self-governance|autonomy]] or even federation, though not full-scale independence, he believed that the ''Pieds-Noirs'' and Arabs could co-exist</span>
				<span class='text'>During the war he advocated a civil truce that would spare the civilians, which was rejected by both sides, who regarded it as foolish</span>
				<span class='text'>Behind the scenes, he began to work for imprisoned Algerians who faced the death penalty</span>

				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|The monument to Camus built in [[Villeblevin]], where he died in an automobile accident on 4 January 1960]]From 1955 to 1956, Camus wrote for ''[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1957, he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in literature]] &quot;for his important literary production, which with clear-sighted earnestness illuminates the problems of the human conscience in our times&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>When he spoke to students at the [[University of Stockholm]], he defended his apparent inactivity in the Algerian question; he stated that he was worried about what might happen to his mother, who still lived in Algeria</span>
				<span class='text'>This led to further ostracism by French left-wing intellectuals</span>
				<span class='text'>amus remained active and ambitious until the end of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>Financed by the money he received with his Nobel Prize, he adapted and directed for the stage [[Dostoevsky|Dostoyesvsky's]] [[Demons (Dostoyevsky novel)|Demons]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The play opened in January 1959 at the Antoine Theatre in Paris</span>
				<span class='text'>It was a critical success as well as an artistic and technical tour de force: 33 actors, 4 hours long, 7 sets, 24 scenes</span>

				<span class='text'>Camus put the painter and set decorator [[Mayo (peintre)|Mayo]], who had already illustrated several of Camus' novels ([[The Stranger (novel)|The Stranger]] - 1948 Ed</span>
				<span class='text'>, in charge of the demanding task of designing these multiple and complex theater sets</span>

				<span class='text'>om|location=France|pages=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;==Philosophy=====Absurdism===Many writers have addressed the Absurd, each with his or her own interpretation of what the Absurd is and what comprises its importance</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, [[Sartre]] recognizes the absurdity of individual experience, while [[Kierkegaard]] explains that the absurdity of certain religious truths prevent us from reaching God rationally</span>
				<span class='text'>Camus regretted the continued reference to himself as a &quot;philosopher of the absurd&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He showed less interest in the Absurd shortly after publishing ''Le Mythe de Sisyphe'' (''The Myth of Sisyphus'')</span>
				<span class='text'>To distinguish his ideas, scholars sometimes refer to the Paradox of the Absurd, when referring to &quot;Camus' Absurd&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}His early thoughts appeared in his first collection of essays, ''L'Envers et l'endroit'' (''Betwixt and Between)'' in 1937</span>
				<span class='text'>Absurd themes were expressed with more sophistication in his second collection of essays, ''Noces'' (''Nuptials''), in 1938</span>
				<span class='text'>In these essays Camus reflects on the experience of the Absurd</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1942 he published the story of a man living an absurd life as [[The Stranger (novel)|''L'Étranger'' (''The Stranger'')]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In the same year he released [[The Myth of Sisyphus|''Le Mythe de Sisyphe'' (''The Myth of Sisyphus'')]], a literary essay on the Absurd</span>
				<span class='text'>He also wrote [[Caligula (play)|a play]] about [[Caligula]], a Roman Emperor, pursuing an absurd logic</span>
				<span class='text'>The play was not performed until 1945</span>
				<span class='text'>he turning point in Camus's attitude to the Absurd occurs in a collection of four letters to an anonymous German friend, written between July 1943 and July 1944</span>
				<span class='text'>The first was published in the ''Revue Libre'' in 1943, the second in the ''Cahiers de Libération'' in 1944, and the third in the newspaper ''Libertés'', in 1945</span>
				<span class='text'>The four letters were published as ''Lettres à un ami allemand'' (''Letters to a German Friend'') in 1945, and were included in the collection ''[[Resistance, Rebellion, and Death]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>==Ideas on the absurd==={{refimprove section|date=November 2011}}Camus presents the reader with dualisms such as happiness and sadness, dark and light, life and death, etc</span>
				<span class='text'>He emphasizes the fact that happiness is fleeting and that the human condition is one of mortality; for Camus, this is cause for a greater appreciation for life and happiness</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''Le Mythe'', dualism becomes a paradox: we value our own lives in spite of our mortality and in spite of the universe's silence</span>
				<span class='text'>While we can live with a dualism (''I can accept periods of unhappiness, because I know I will also experience happiness to come''), we cannot live with the paradox (''I think my life is of great importance, but I also think it is meaningless'')</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''Le Mythe'', Camus investigates our experience of the Absurd and asks how we live with it</span>
				<span class='text'>Our life must have meaning for us to value it</span>
				<span class='text'>If we accept that life has no meaning and therefore no value, should we kill ourselves?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Camus|first=Albert|title=The Myth of Sisyphus and Other Essays|origyear=1942|year=1955|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|pages=3–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;In ''Le Mythe'', Camus suggests that 'creation of meaning' would entail a logical leap or a kind of philosophical suicide in order to find psychological comfort</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Camus|first=Albert|title=The Myth of Sisyphus and Other Essays|origyear=1942|year=1955|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|pages=21–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But Camus wants to know if he can live with what logic and lucidity has uncovered – if one can build a foundation on what one knows and nothing more</span>
				<span class='text'>Creation of meaning is not a viable alternative but a logical leap and an evasion of the problem</span>
				<span class='text'>He gives examples of how others would seem to make this kind of leap</span>
				<span class='text'>The alternative option, namely suicide, would entail another kind of leap, where one attempts to kill absurdity by destroying one of its terms (the human being)</span>
				<span class='text'>Camus points out, however, that there is no more meaning in death than there is in life, and that it simply evades the problem yet again</span>
				<span class='text'>Camus concludes that we must instead &quot;entertain&quot; both death and the absurd, while never agreeing to their terms</span>
				<span class='text'>eursault, the absurdist hero of ''L'Étranger,'' has killed a man and is scheduled to be executed</span>
				<span class='text'>Caligula ends up admitting his absurd logic was wrong and is killed by an assassination he has deliberately brought about</span>
				<span class='text'>However, while Camus possibly suggests that Caligula's absurd reasoning is wrong, the play's anti-hero does get the last word, as the author similarly exalts Meursault's final moments</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Camus|first=Albert|title=Caligula and Three Other Plays|origyear=1944|year=1958|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;Camus made a significant contribution to a viewpoint of the Absurd, and always rejected nihilism as a valid response</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;If nothing had any meaning, you would be right</span>
				<span class='text'>But there is something that still has a meaning</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; ''Second Letter to a German Friend'', December 1943</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/blockquote&gt;Camus's understanding of the Absurd promotes public debate; his various offerings entice us to think about the Absurd and offer our own contribution</span>
				<span class='text'>Concepts such as cooperation, joint effort and solidarity are of key importance to Camus, though they are most likely sources of 'relative' versus 'absolute' meaning</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]],'' Camus identifies rebellion (or rather, the values indicated by rebellion) as a basis for human solidarity</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;When he rebels, a man identifies himself with other men and so surpasses himself, and from this point of view human solidarity is metaphysical</span>
				<span class='text'>But for the moment we are only talking of the kind of solidarity that is born in chains</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bronner2009&quot; /&gt;Camus's well-known falling out with Sartre is linked to his opposition to communism</span>

				<span class='text'>This was apparent in his work ''L'Homme Révolté'' (''The Rebel'') which not only was an assault on the Soviet police state, but also questioned the very nature of mass revolutionary politics</span>
				<span class='text'>Camus continued to speak out against the atrocities of the [[Soviet Union]], a sentiment captured in his 1957 speech, ''The Blood of the Hungarians'', commemorating the anniversary of the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]], an uprising crushed in a bloody assault by the Red Army</span>
