				<span class='text'>This led to further ostracism by French left wing intellectuals</span>
				<span class='text'>amus remained active and ambitious until the end of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>Financed by the money he received with his Nobel Prize he adapted and directed for the stage  </span>

				<span class='text'> The walls could move sideways to reduce the size of each depicted location and the whole stage rotated to allow for immediate set transformations</span>
				<span class='text'>Camus put the painter and set decorator  who had already illustrated several of Camus novels    1948 Ed</span>
				<span class='text'>in charge of the demanding task of designing these multiple and complex theater sets</span>
				<span class='text'>PhilosophyMany writers have addressed the Absurd each with his or her own interpretation of what the Absurd is and what comprises its importance</span>
				<span class='text'>For example  recognizes the absurdity of individual experience while  explains that the absurdity of certain religious truths prevent us from reaching God rationally</span>
				<span class='text'>Camus regretted the continued erence to himself as a philosopher of the absurd</span>
				<span class='text'>He showed less interest in the Absurd shortly after publishing Le Mythe de Sisyphe The Myth of Sisyphus</span>
				<span class='text'>To distinguish his ideas scholars sometimes er to the Paradox of the Absurd when erring to Camus Absurd</span>
				<span class='text'>is early thoughts appeared in his first collection of essays LEnvers et lendroit Betwixt and Between in 1937</span>
				<span class='text'>Absurd themes were expressed with more sophistication in his second collection of essays Noces Nuptials in 1938</span>
				<span class='text'>In these essays Camus lects on the experience of the Absurd</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1942 he published the story of a man living an absurd life as </span>
				<span class='text'>In the same year he released  a literary essay on the Absurd</span>
				<span class='text'>He also wrote  about  a Roman Emperor pursuing an absurd logic</span>
				<span class='text'>The play was not performed until 1945</span>
				<span class='text'>he turning point in Camuss attitude to the Absurd occurs in a collection of four letters to an anonymous German friend written between July 1943 and July 1944</span>
				<span class='text'>The first was published in the Revue Libre in 1943 the second in the Cahiers de Libération in 1944 and the third in the newspaper Libertés in 1945</span>
				<span class='text'>The four letters were published as Lettres à un ami allemand Letters to a German Friend in 1945 and were included in the collection </span>
				<span class='text'>amus presents the reader with dualisms such as happiness and sadness dark and light life and death etc</span>
				<span class='text'>He emphasizes the fact that happiness is fleeting and that the human condition is one of mortality for Camus this is cause for a greater appreciation for life and happiness</span>
				<span class='text'>In Le Mythe dualism becomes a paradox we value our own lives in spite of our mortality and in spite of the universes silence</span>
				<span class='text'>While we can live with a dualism I can accept periods of unhappiness because I know I will also experience happiness to come we cannot live with the paradox I think my life is of great importance but I also think it is meaningless</span>
				<span class='text'>In Le Mythe Camus investigates our experience of the Absurd and asks how we live with it</span>
				<span class='text'>Our life must have meaning for us to value it</span>
				<span class='text'>If we accept that life has no meaning and theore no value should we kill ourselves In Le Mythe Camus suggests that creation of meaning would entail a logical leap or a kind of philosophical suicide in order to find psychological comfort</span>
				<span class='text'>  But Camus wants to know if he can live with what logic and lucidity has uncovered – if one can build a foundation on what one knows and nothing more</span>
				<span class='text'>Creation of meaning is not a viable alternative but a logical leap and an evasion of the problem</span>
				<span class='text'>He gives examples of how others would seem to make this kind of leap</span>
				<span class='text'>The alternative option namely suicide would entail another kind of leap where one attempts to kill absurdity by destroying one of its terms the human being</span>
				<span class='text'>Camus points out however that there is no more meaning in death than there is in life and that it simply evades the problem yet again</span>
				<span class='text'>Camus concludes that we must instead entertain both death and the absurd while never agreeing to their terms</span>
				<span class='text'>eursault the absurdist hero of LÉtranger has killed a man and is scheduled to be executed</span>
				<span class='text'>Caligula ends up admitting his absurd logic was wrong and is killed by an assassination he has deliberately brought about</span>
				<span class='text'>However while Camus possibly suggests that Caligulas absurd reasoning is wrong the plays anti hero does get the last word as the author similarly exalts Meursaults final moments</span>
				<span class='text'>Camus made a significant contribution to a viewpoint of the Absurd and always rejected nihilism as a valid response</span>
				<span class='text'>blockquoteIf nothing had any meaning you would be right</span>
				<span class='text'>But there is something that still has a meaning</span>
				<span class='text'>Second Letter to a German Friend December 1943</span>
				<span class='text'>blockquoteCamuss understanding of the Absurd promotes public debate his various offerings entice us to think about the Absurd and offer our own contribution</span>
				<span class='text'>Concepts such as cooperation joint effort and solidarity are of key importance to Camus though they are most likely sources of relative versus absolute meaning</span>
				<span class='text'>In  Camus identifies rebellion or rather the values indicated by rebellion as a basis for human solidarity</span>
				<span class='text'>blockquoteWhen he rebels a man identifies himself with other men and so surpasses himself and from this point of view human solidarity is metaphysical</span>
				<span class='text'>But for the moment we are only talking of the kind of solidarity that is born in chains</span>
				<span class='text'>  blockquoteDespite his opposition to the label Camus addressed one of the fundamental questions of existentialism the problem of </span>
				<span class='text'> He wrote There is only one really serious philosophical question and that is suicide</span>
				<span class='text'>Deciding whether or not life is worth living is to answer the fundamental question in philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>All other questions follow from that</span>
