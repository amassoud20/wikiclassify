				<span class='text'>Liebig published on a wide variety of topics, personally averaging thirty papers per year between 1830 and 1840</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brock/&gt;{{rp|76}} Liebig not only isolated individual substances, but also studied their interrelationships and the ways in which they degraded and metamorphosed into other substances, looking for clues to the understanding of both chemical composition and physiological function</span>
				<span class='text'> Other significant contributions by Liebig during this time include his examination ofthe [[nitrogen]] content of bases;&lt;ref name=Brock/&gt;{{rp|77}} the study of chlorination and the isolation of [[chloral]] (1832);&lt;ref name=Brock/&gt;{{rp|83}}the identification of the [[ethyl radical]] (1834);&lt;ref name=Brock/&gt;{{rp|82}}the oxidation of alcohol and formation of [[aldehyde]] (1835);&lt;ref name=Brock/&gt;{{rp|84}}the polybasic theory of organic acids (1838);&lt;ref name=Brock/&gt;{{rp|86–87}}and the degradation of [[urea]] (1837)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brock/&gt;{{rp|88–89}}Writing about the analysis of urine, a complex organic product, he made a declaration that reveals both the changes that were occurring in chemistry over a short time and the impact of his own work</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brock/&gt;{{rp|89}}  At a time when many chemists such as [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius]] still insisted on a hard and fast separation between the organic and inorganic, Liebig asserted:{{quote|text=&quot;The production of all organic substances no longer belongs just to living organisms</span>
				<span class='text'> It must be seen as not only probable, but as certain, that we shall be able to produce them in our laboratories</span>
				<span class='text'> Sugar, salicin, and morphine will be artificially produced</span>
				<span class='text'> Of course, we do not yet know how to do this, because we do not yet know the precursors from which these compounds arise</span>
				<span class='text'> But we shall come to know them</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; |source=[Liebig and Woehler (1838)]}}Liebig's arguments against any chemical distinction between living (physiological) and dead chemical processes proved a great inspiration to several of his students and others who were interested in [[materialism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Though Liebig distanced himself from the direct political implications of materialism, he tacitly supported the work of [[Karl Vogt]] (1817–1895), [[Jacob Moleschott]] (1822–1893), and [[Ludwig Buechner]] (1824–1899)</span>
				<span class='text'>==Plant nutrition===By the 1840s, Liebig was attempting to apply theoretical knowledge from organic chemistry to real-world problems of food availability</span>
				<span class='text'> His book ''Die organische Chemie in ihrer Anwendung auf Agricultur und Physiologie (Organic Chemistry in its Application to Agriculture and Physiology)'' (1840) promoted the idea that chemistry could revolutionize agricultural practice, increasing yields and lowering costs</span>
				<span class='text'>It was widely translated, vociferously critiqued, and highly influential</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brock/&gt;Liebig's book discussed chemical transformations within living systems, both plant and animal, outlining a theoretical approach to agricultural chemistry</span>
				<span class='text'>The first part of the book focused on plant nutrition, the second on chemical mechanisms of putrefaction and decay</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brock/&gt;{{rp|148}} Liebig's awareness of both synthesis and degradation led him to become an early advocate of [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]], promoting ideas such as the recycling of [[sewage]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brock/&gt;{{rp|250–270}}Liebig argued against prevalent theories about role of [[humus]] in plant nutrition, which held that decayed plant matter was the primary source of carbon for plant nutrition</span>
				<span class='text'>Fertilizers were believed to act by breaking down humus, making it easier for plants to absorb</span>
				<span class='text'>Associated with such ideas was the belief that some sort of &quot;vital force&quot; distinguished reactions involving organic as opposed to inorganic materials</span>

				<span class='text'>Carbon dioxide was known to be taken in and oxygen released during photosynthesis, but researchers suggested that oxygen was obtained from carbon dioxide, rather than from water</span>
				<span class='text'>Hydrogen was believed to come primarily from water</span>
				<span class='text'>Researchers disagreed about whether sources of carbon and nitrogen were atmospheric or soil-based</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Hill/&gt;{{rp|xv-xxi}} [[Nicolas-Théodore de Saussure]]'s experiments, reported in ''Recherches Chimiques sur la Végétation'' (1804), suggested that carbon was obtained from atmospheric rather than soil-based sources, and that water was a likely source of hydrogen</span>
				<span class='text'>He also studied the absorption of minerals by plants, and observed that mineral concentrations in plants tended to reflect their presence in the soil in which the plants were grown</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the implications of De Saussure's results for theories of plant nutrition were neither clearly discussed nor easily understood</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Hill/&gt;{{rp|xxii-xxvii}}Liebig reaffirmed the importance of De Saussures' findings, and used them to critique humus theories, while regretting the limitations of De Saussure's experimental techniques</span>
				<span class='text'>Using more precise methods of measurement as a basis for estimation, he pointed out contradictions such as the inability of existing soil humus to provide enough carbon to support the plants growing in it</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Hill/&gt;{{rp|xxix}} By the late 1830s, researchers like [[Karl Sprengel]] were using Liebig's methods of combustion analysis to assess manures, concluding that their value could be attributed to their constituent minerals</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brock/&gt;{{rp|106}} Liebig synthesized ideas about the mineral theory of plant nutrition and added his own conviction that inorganic materials could provide nutrients as effectively as organic sources</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brock/&gt;{{rp|148}}In his theory of mineral nutrients, Liebig identified the chemical elements of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) as essential to plant growth</span>
				<span class='text'>He reported that plants acquire Carbon (C) and Hydrogen (H) from the atmosphere and from water (H2O)</span>
				<span class='text'>As well as emphasizing the importance of minerals in the soil, he argued that plants feed on nitrogen compounds derived from the air</span>
				<span class='text'>This assertion was a source of contention for many years, and turned out to be true for legumes, but not for other plants</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brock/&gt;{{rp|181}}[[File:Minimum-Tonne</span>
				<span class='text'>vg|thumb|right|Liebig's Barrel]]Liebig also popularized [[Carl Sprengel]]'s &quot;Theorem of minimum&quot; (known as [[Liebig's Law of the Minimum|Law of the Minimum]]), stating that plant growth is not determined by the total resources available, but by the scarcest available resource</span>
				<span class='text'> A plant's development is limited by the one essential mineral that is in the relatively shortest supply</span>
				<span class='text'> This concept of limitation can be visualized as &quot;Liebig's barrel&quot;, a metaphorical barrel in which each stave represents a different element</span>
				<span class='text'>A nutrient stave that is shorter than the others will cause the liquid contained in the barrel to spill out at that level</span>
				<span class='text'>This is a qualitative version of the principles used for determining the application of fertilizer in modern agriculture</span>
				<span class='text'>'Organic Chemistry'' was not intended as a  guide to practical agriculture</span>
				<span class='text'>Liebig's lack of experience in practical applications, and differences between editions of the book, fueled considerable criticism</span>
				<span class='text'>Nonetheless, Liebig’s writings had a profound impact on agriculture, spurring experiment and theoretical debate in Germany, England, and France</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brock/&gt;{{rp|165}}One of his most recognized  accomplishments is the development of nitrogen-based [[fertilizer]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In the first two editions of his book (1840, 1842), Liebig reported that there was not sufficient nitrogen in the atmosphere, and argued that nitrogen-based fertilizer was needed to grow the healthiest possible crops</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brock/&gt;{{rp|120}} Liebig believed that nitrogen could be supplied in the form of [[ammonia]], and recognized the possibility of substituting chemical fertilizers for natural ones (animal dung, etc</span>
				<span class='text'>He later became convinced that nitrogen was sufficiently supplied by precipitation of ammonia from the atmosphere, and argued vehemently against the use of nitrogen-based fertilizers for many years</span>
				<span class='text'>An early commercial attempt to produce his own fertilizers was unsuccessful, due to lack of testing in actual agricultural conditions, and to lack of nitrogen in the mixtures</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brock/&gt;{{rp|121–124}}Liebig's difficulties in reconciling theory and practice reflected that the real world of agriculture was more complex than was at first realized</span>
				<span class='text'>By the publication of the seventh German edition of ''Agricultural Chemistry'' he had moderated some of his views, admitting some mistakes and returning to the position that nitrogen-based fertilizers were beneficial or even necessary</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brock/&gt;{{rp|179}} Nitrogen fertilizers are now widely used throughout the world, and their production is a substantial segment of the chemical industry</span>

				<span class='text'>spx|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;===Plant and animal physiology===Liebig's work on applying chemistry to plant and animal physiology was especially influential</span>
				<span class='text'>By 1842, he had published ''Chimie organique appliquée à la physiologie animale et à la pathologie'', published in English as '' Animal chemistry, or, Organic chemistry in its applications to physiology and pathology'', presenting a chemical theory of metabolism</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brock/&gt;{{rp|185}} The experimental techniques used by Liebig and others often involved controlling and measuring diet, and monitoring and analyzing the products of animal metabolism, as indicators of internal metabolic processes</span>
				<span class='text'> Liebig saw similarities between plant and animal metabolism, and suggested that nitrogenous animal matter was similar to, and derived from, plant matter</span>
				<span class='text'> He categorized foodstuffs into two groups, nitrogenous materials which he believed were used to build animal tissue, and non-nitrogenous materials which he believed were involved in separate processes of respiration and generation of heat</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brock/&gt;{{rp|184}}French researchers such as [[Jean-Baptiste Dumas]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Boussingault]] believed that animals assimilated sugars, proteins, and fats from plant materials and lacked the ability to synthesize them</span>
				<span class='text'>Liebig's work suggested a common ability of plants and animals to synthesize complex molecules from simpler ones</span>
				<span class='text'>His experiments on fat metabolism convinced him that animals must be able to synthesize fats from sugars and starch</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brock/&gt;{{rp|187}} Other researchers built upon his work, confirming the abilities of animals to synthesize sugar and build fat</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brock/&gt;{{rp|189–190}}Liebig also studied respiration, at one point measuring the &quot;ingesta and excreta&quot; of 855 soldiers, a bodyguard of the Grand Duke of Hessen-Darmstadt, for an entire month</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brock/&gt;{{rp|191}}  He outlined an extremely speculative model of equations in which he attempted to explain how protein degradation might balance within a healthy body and result in pathological imbalances in cases of illness or inappropriate nutrition</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brock/&gt;{{rp|191–193}} This proposed model was justifiably criticized</span>
				<span class='text'>Berzelius stingingly stated that &quot;this facile kind of physiological chemistry is created at the writing table&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brock/&gt;{{rp|194}} Some of the ideas that Liebig had enthusiastically incorporated were not supported by further research</span>
				<span class='text'> The third and last edition of ''Animal chemistry'' (1846) was substantially revised and did not include the equations</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brock/&gt;{{rp|195–197}}  The third area discussed in ''Animal Chemistry'' was fermentation and putrefaction</span>
				<span class='text'>Liebig proposed chemical explanations for processes such as [[Decomposition|eremacausis]] (organic decomposition), describing the rearrangement of atoms as a result of unstable &quot;affinities&quot; reacting to external causes such as air or already decaying substances</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brock/&gt;{{rp|205}}  Liebig identified the blood as the site of the body's &quot;chemical factory&quot;, where he believed processes of synthesis and degradation took place</span>
				<span class='text'>He presented a view of disease in terms of chemical process, in which healthy blood could be attacked by external contagia; secreting organs sought to transform and excrete such substances; and failure to do so could lead to their elimination through the skin, lungs, and other organs, potentially spreading  contagion</span>
				<span class='text'>Again, although the world was much more complicated than his theory, and many of his individual ideas were later proved wrong, Liebig managed to synthesize existing knowledge in a way that had significant implications for doctors, sanitarians and social reformers</span>
				<span class='text'>The English medical journal ''[[The Lancet]]'' reviewed Liebig's work and translated his chemical lectures as part of its mission to establish a new era of medicine</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brock/&gt;{{rp|207}} Liebig's ideas stimulated significant medical research, led to the development of better techniques for testing experimental models of metabolism, and pointed to chemistry as fundamental to the understanding of health and disease</span>

				<span class='text'>In his ''Researches on the chemistry of food'' (1847) Liebig argued that it was important to eat not only meat fibre, but also meat juices, which contained various inorganic chemicals</span>
				<span class='text'>These vital ingredients would be lost during conventional boiling or roasting in which cooking liquids were discarded</span>
				<span class='text'> For optimum nutritional quality, Liebig advised that cooks should either sear the meat initially to retain fluids, or retain and use cooking liquids (as in soups or stews)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brock/&gt;{{rp|217–218}}Liebig was acclaimed in ''[[The Lancet]]'' for revealing &quot;the true principles of cookery&quot;, and physicians promoted &quot;rational diets&quot; based on his ideas</span>
				<span class='text'>Well-known British cookery writer [[Eliza Acton]] responded to Liebig by modifying the cookery techniques in the third edition of her ''Modern Cookery for Private Families'', and subtitling the edition accordingly</span>
