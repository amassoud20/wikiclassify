				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; was an English historian and Member of Parliament</span>
				<span class='text'>His most important work, ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', was published in six volumes between 1776 and 1788</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''Decline and Fall'' is known for the quality and irony of its prose, its use of primary sources, and its open criticism of organized religion</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;The most recent and also the first critical edition, in three volumes, is that of David Womersley</span>
				<span class='text'>For commentary on Gibbon's irony and insistence on primary sources whenever available, see Womersley, &quot;Introduction&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>While the larger part of Gibbon's caustic view of Christianity is declared within the text of chapters XV and XVI, Gibbon rarely neglects to note its baleful influence throughout the remaining volumes of the ''Decline and Fall''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Early life: 1737–1752==Edward Gibbon was born in 1737, the son of Edward and Judith Gibbon at Lime Grove, in the town of [[Putney]], [[Surrey]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He had six siblings: five brothers and one sister, all of whom died in infancy</span>
				<span class='text'>His grandfather, also named Edward, had lost all of his assets as a result of the [[South Sea Company|South Sea Bubble]] stock market collapse in 1720, but eventually regained much of his wealth, so that Gibbon's father was able to inherit a substantial estate</span>

				<span class='text'>7</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;As a youth, Gibbon's health was under constant threat</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;!--this out til we find out where it is; he described himself as &quot;a weakly child</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; --&gt; He described himself as &quot;a puny child, neglected by my Mother, starved by my nurse&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>At age nine, he was sent to Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Woddeson's school at [[Kingston upon Thames]] (now [[Kingston Grammar School]]), shortly after which his mother died</span>
				<span class='text'> He then took up residence in the [[Westminster School]] boarding house, owned by his adored &quot;Aunt Kitty&quot;, Catherine Porten</span>
				<span class='text'> Soon after she died in 1786, he remembered her as rescuing him from his mother's disdain, and imparting &quot;the first rudiments of knowledge, the first exercise of reason, and a taste for books which is still the pleasure and glory of my life&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Norton, ''Letters'', vol</span>
				<span class='text'>3, 10/5/[17]86, 45–48</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; By 1751, Gibbon's reading was already extensive and certainly pointed toward his future pursuits: [[Laurence Echard]]'s ''Roman History'' (1713), William Howel(l)'s ''An Institution of General History'' (1680–85), and several of the 65 volumes of the acclaimed ''[[Universal History (Sale et al)|Universal History from the Earliest Account of Time]]'' (1747–1768)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Stephen, ''DNB'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>1130; Pocock, ''Enlightenments of Edward Gibbon'', 29–40</span>
				<span class='text'>At age 14, Gibbon was &quot;a prodigy of uncontrolled reading&quot;; Gibbon himself admitted an &quot;indiscriminate appetite&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>p</span>
				<span class='text'>29</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Oxford, Lausanne, and a religious journey: 1752–1758==Following a stay at Bath in 1752 to improve his health, at the age of 15 Gibbon was sent by his father to [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], where he was enrolled as a gentleman-commoner</span>
				<span class='text'>He was ill-suited, however, to the college atmosphere and later rued his 14 months there as the &quot;most idle and unprofitable&quot; of his life</span>
				<span class='text'> Because he himself says so in his autobiography, it used to be thought that his penchant for &quot;theological controversy&quot; (his aunt's influence) fully bloomed when he came under the spell of the deist or rationalist theologian [[Conyers Middleton]] (1683–1750), the author of ''Free Inquiry into the Miraculous Powers'' (1749)</span>
				<span class='text'>In that tract, Middleton denied the validity of such powers; Gibbon promptly objected, or so the argument used to run</span>
				<span class='text'>The product of that disagreement, with some assistance from the work of Catholic Bishop [[Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet]] (1627–1704), and that of the Elizabethan Jesuit [[Robert Parsons (priest)|Robert Parsons]] (1546–1610), yielded the most memorable event of his time at Oxford: his conversion to Roman Catholicism on 8 June 1753</span>
				<span class='text'> He was further &quot;corrupted&quot; by the 'free thinking' deism of the playwright/poet couple [[David Mallet (writer)|David and Lucy Mallet]];&lt;ref&gt;Pocock, ''Enlightenments of Edward Gibbon''</span>
				<span class='text'>for Middleton, see pp</span>
				<span class='text'>45–47; for Bossuet, p</span>
				<span class='text'>47; for the Mallets, p</span>
				<span class='text'>3; Robert Parsons [or Persons], ''A Christian directory: The first booke of the Christian exercise, appertaining to resolution'', (London, 1582)</span>
				<span class='text'>In his 1796 edition of Gibbon's ''Memoirs'', Lord Sheffield claims that Gibbon directly connected his Catholic conversion to his reading of Parsons</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp; Womersley, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>9</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and finally Gibbon's father, already &quot;in despair,&quot; had had enough</span>
				<span class='text'>David Womersley has shown, however, that Gibbon's claim to having been converted by a reading of Middleton is very unlikely, and was introduced only into the final draft of the &quot;Memoirs&quot; in 1792–93</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Womersley, ''Gibbon and the 'Watchmen of the Holy City': The Historian and His Reputation, 1776–1815'' (Oxford University Press, 2002), as cited by G</span>

				<span class='text'>Bowersock in ''The New York Review of Books'', 25 November 2010, p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;56</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Bowersock suggests that Gibbon fabricated the Middleton story retrospectively in his anxiety about the impact of the French Revolution and [[Edmund Burke]]'s claim that it was provoked by the French ''philosophes'', so influential on Gibbon</span>
				<span class='text'>ithin weeks of his conversion, the adolescent was removed from Oxford and sent to live under the care and tutelage of Daniel Pavillard, Reformed pastor of [[Lausanne, Switzerland]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It was here that he made one of his life's two great friendships, that of [[Jacques Georges Deyverdun]] (the French language translator of [[Goethe]]'s ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]''); the other being John Baker Holroyd (later [[John Holroyd, 1st Earl of Sheffield|Lord Sheffield]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Just a year and a half later, after his father threatened to disinherit him, on Christmas Day, 1754, he reconverted to Protestantism</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;The various articles of the Romish creed,&quot; he wrote, &quot;disappeared like a dream&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;John Murray (ed</span>

				<span class='text'>Second Edition'' (London: John Murray, 1897), p</span>
				<span class='text'>137</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He remained in Lausanne for five intellectually productive years, a period that greatly enriched Gibbon's already immense aptitude for scholarship and erudition: he read Latin literature; travelled throughout Switzerland studying its cantons' constitutions; and studied the works of [[Hugo Grotius]], [[Samuel von Pufendorf]], [[John Locke]], [[Pierre Bayle]], and [[Blaise Pascal]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Thwarted romance==[[File:Edward Gibbon by Henry Walton cleaned</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|Edward Gibbon, by Henry Walton (died 1813)]]He also met the one romance in his life: the daughter of the pastor of Crassy, a young woman named [[Suzanne Curchod]], who would later become the wife of Louis XVI's finance minister [[Jacques Necker]], and the mother of [[Anne Louise Germaine de Staël|Madame de Staël]]</span>
				<span class='text'> The two developed a warm affinity; Gibbon proceeded to propose marriage,&lt;ref&gt;Norton, ''Biblio'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>2; &amp;nbsp; ''Letters'', vol</span>
				<span class='text'>1, p</span>
				<span class='text'>396</span>
				<span class='text'>a concise summary of their relationship is found at 396–401</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; but ultimately wedlock was out of the question, blocked both by his father's staunch disapproval and Curchod's equally staunch reluctance to leave Switzerland</span>
				<span class='text'>Gibbon returned to England in August 1758 to face his father</span>
				<span class='text'>There could be no refusal of the elder's wishes</span>
				<span class='text'>Gibbon put it this way: &quot;I sighed as a lover, I obeyed as a son</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Murray, p</span>
				<span class='text'>239</span>
				<span class='text'>The phrase, &quot;sighed [etc</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot; alludes to the play ''Polyeucte'' by &quot;the father of French tragedy,&quot; [[Pierre Corneille]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Womersley, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>11</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He proceeded to cut off all contact with Curchod, even as she vowed to wait for him</span>
				<span class='text'>Their final emotional break apparently came at [[Ferney]], France in the spring of 1764, though they did see each other at least one more time a year later</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Womersley, 11–12</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==First fame and the grand tour: 1758–1765==[[File:Keep of Portchester Castle, 2008</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|[[Portchester Castle]] came under Gibbon's command for a brief period while he was an officer in the Hampshire militia</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodall|2008|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]Upon his return to England, Gibbon published his first book, ''Essai sur l'Étude de la Littérature'' in 1761, which produced an initial taste of celebrity and distinguished him, in Paris at least, as a man of letters</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;In the ''Essai'', the 24-year-old boldly braved the reigning philosoph[e]ic fashion to uphold the studious values and practices of the ''érudits'' (antiquarian scholars)</span>
				<span class='text'>Womersley, p</span>
				<span class='text'>11; and ''[[Miscellaneous Works of Edward Gibbon#The Miscellaneous Works|The Miscellaneous Works]]'', First edition, vol</span>
				<span class='text'>2</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; From 1759 to 1770, Gibbon served on active duty and in reserve with the South Hampshire militia, his deactivation in December 1762 coinciding with the militia's dispersal at the end of the [[Seven Years' War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Womersley, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>11, 12</span>
				<span class='text'>Gibbon was commissioned a captain and resigned a lieutenant colonel, later crediting his service with providing him &quot;a larger introduction into the English world</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; There was further, the matter of a vast utility: &quot;The discipline and evolutions of a modern battalion gave me a clearer notion of the phalanx and the legion; and the captain of the Hampshire grenadiers (the reader may smile) has not been useless to the historian of the Roman empire</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Murray, p</span>
				<span class='text'>190</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The following year he embarked on the [[Grand Tour]] (of continental Europe), which included a visit to Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>In his autobiography Gibbon vividly records his rapture when he finally neared &quot;the great object of [my] pilgrimage&quot;:&lt;blockquote&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>t the distance of twenty-five years I can neither forget nor express the strong emotions which agitated my mind as I first approached and entered the ''eternal City''</span>
				<span class='text'> After a sleepless night, I trod, with a lofty step the ruins of the Forum; each memorable spot where Romulus ''stood'', or [[Cicero|Tully]] spoke, or Caesar fell, was at once present to my eye; and several days of intoxication were lost or enjoyed before I could descend to a cool and minute investigation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Murray, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>266–267</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;And it was here that Gibbon first conceived the idea of composing a history of the city, later extended to the entire [[Roman Empire|empire]], a moment known to history as the &quot;Capitoline vision&quot;:&lt;ref&gt;Pocock, &quot;Classical History,&quot; ¶ #2</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;It was at Rome, on the fifteenth of October 1764, as I sat musing amidst the ruins of the [[Capitoline Hill|Capitol]], while the barefooted fryars were singing [[Vespers]] in the [[Santa Maria Aracoeli|temple]] of [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]], that the idea of writing the decline and fall of the City first started to my mind</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Murray, p</span>
				<span class='text'>302</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Womersley (''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;12) notes the existence of &quot;good reasons&quot; to doubt the statement's accuracy</span>
				<span class='text'>Elaborating, Pocock (&quot;Classical History,&quot; ¶ #2) refers to it as a likely &quot;creation of memory&quot; or a &quot;literary invention&quot;, given that Gibbon, in his autobiography, claimed that his journal dated the reminiscence to 15 October, when in fact the journal gives no date</span>
				<span class='text'>=Gibbon's literary failures==In June of 1765, Gibbon returned to his father's house, and remained there until the latter's death in 1770</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Considered by Gibbon as the worst five years of his life, he tried to remain busy by making early attempts towards writing full histories</span>
				<span class='text'>His first historical narrative known as the ''History of Switzerland'', which represented Gibbon's love for Switzerland, was never published nor finished</span>
				<span class='text'>Even under the guidance of Deyverdun (a German translator for Gibbons), Gibbon became too critical of himself, and completely abandoned the project, only writing 60 pages of texts</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; However, after Gibbon's death, his writings on Switzerland's history were discovered and published by Lord Sheffield in 1815</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon after abandoning his History of Switzerland, Gibbon made another attempt towards completing a full history</span>
				<span class='text'>is second work, ''Memoires Litteraires de la Grande Bretagne'', was a two volume set which described the literary and social conditions of England at the time, such as Lord Lyttelton's history of Henry II and Lardner's work on the Credibility of Gospel History</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Gibbon's ''Memoires Litteraires'' failed to gain any notoriety, and was considered a flop by fellow historians and literary scholars</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|Blue plaque to Gibbon on Bentinck Street, London]]Gibbon returned to England in June 1765</span>
				<span class='text'>His father died in 1770, and after tending to the estate, which was by no means in good condition, there remained quite enough for Gibbon to settle fashionably in London at 7 Bentinck Street, independent of financial concerns</span>
				<span class='text'>By February 1773, he was writing in earnest, but not without the occasional self-imposed distraction</span>
				<span class='text'>He took to London society quite easily, joined the better social clubs, including [[Samuel Johnson|Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Johnson]]'s [[The Club (dining club)|Literary Club]], and looked in from time to time on his friend Holroyd in Sussex</span>
				<span class='text'>He succeeded [[Oliver Goldsmith]] at the Royal Academy as 'professor in ancient history' (honorary but prestigious)</span>
				<span class='text'>In late 1774, he was initiated a [[freemason]] of the [[Premier Grand Lodge of England]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> in London's ''Lodge of Friendship No</span>

				<span class='text'>tml Gibbon's freemasonry]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; And, perhaps least productively in that same year, he was returned to the House of Commons for [[Liskeard (UK Parliament constituency)|Liskeard]], Cornwall through the intervention of his relative and patron, [[Edward Craggs-Eliot, 1st Baron Eliot|Edward Eliot]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He became the archetypal back-bencher, benignly &quot;mute&quot; and &quot;indifferent,&quot; his support of the [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] ministry invariably automatic</span>
				<span class='text'>Gibbon's indolence in that position, perhaps fully intentional, subtracted little from the progress of his writing</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gibbon lost the Liskeard seat in 1780 when Eliot joined the opposition, taking with him &quot;the Electors of Leskeard [who] are commonly of the same opinion as Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>El[l]iot</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; (Murray, p</span>
				<span class='text'>322</span>
				<span class='text'> The following year, owing to the good grace of Prime Minister [[Lord North]], he was again returned to Parliament, this time for [[Lymington (UK Parliament constituency)|Lymington]] on a by-election</span>
				<span class='text'>Gibbon's Whiggery was solidly conservative: in favour of the propertied oligarchy while upholding the subject's rights under the rule of law; though staunchly against ideas such as the natural rights of man and popular sovereignty, what he referred to as &quot;the wild &amp; mischievous system of Democracy&quot; (Dickinson, &quot;Politics,&quot; 178–79)</span>
				<span class='text'>Gibbon also served on the government's Board of Trade and Plantations from 1779 until 1782, when the Board was abolished</span>
				<span class='text'>The subsequent promise of an embassy position in Paris ultimately aborted, serendipitously leaving Gibbon free to focus on his great project</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;After several rewrites, with Gibbon &quot;often tempted to throw away the labours of seven years,&quot; the first volume of what would become his life's major achievement, ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', was published on 17 February 1776</span>
				<span class='text'>Through 1777, the reading public eagerly consumed three editions for which Gibbon was rewarded handsomely: two-thirds of the profits amounting to approximately £1,000</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Norton, ''Biblio'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>37, 45</span>
				<span class='text'>Gibbon sold the copyrights to the remaining editions of volume 1 and the remaining 5 volumes to publishers Strahan &amp; Cadell for £8000</span>
				<span class='text'> The great ''History'' earned the author a total of about £9000</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Biographer [[Sir Leslie Stephen|Leslie Stephen]] wrote that thereafter, &quot;His fame was as rapid as it has been lasting</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;  And as regards this first volume, &quot;Some warm praise from [[David Hume]] overpaid the labour of ten years</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;Volumes II and III appeared on 1 March 1781, eventually rising &quot;to a level with the previous volume in general esteem</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Volume IV was finished in June 1784;&lt;ref&gt;Norton, ''Biblio'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>49, 57</span>
				<span class='text'>Both Norton and Womersley (''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>14) establish that vol</span>
				<span class='text'>IV was ''substantially'' complete by the end of 1783</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; the final two were completed during a second Lausanne sojourn (September 1783 to August 1787) where Gibbon reunited with his friend Deyverdun in leisurely comfort</span>
				<span class='text'>By early 1787, he was &quot;straining for the goal&quot; and with great relief the project was finished in June</span>
				<span class='text'>Gibbon later wrote:{{quote|It was on the day, or rather the night, of 27 June 1787, between the hours of eleven and twelve, that I wrote the last lines of the last page in a summer-house in my garden</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> will not dissemble the first emotions of joy on the recovery of my freedom, and perhaps the establishment of my fame</span>
				<span class='text'>But my pride was soon humbled, and a sober melancholy was spread over my mind by the idea that I had taken my everlasting leave of an old and agreeable companion, and that, whatsoever might be the future date of my history, the life of the historian must be short and precarious</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Murray, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>333–334</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;}}Volumes IV, V, and VI finally reached the press in May 1788, their publication having been delayed since March so it could coincide with a dinner party celebrating Gibbon's 51st birthday (the 8th)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Norton, ''Biblio'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>61</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Mounting a bandwagon of praise for the later volumes were such contemporary luminaries as [[Adam Smith]], [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]], [[Adam Ferguson]], [[Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden|Lord Camden]], and [[Horace Walpole]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Smith remarked that Gibbon's triumph had positioned him &quot;at the very head of [Europe's] literary tribe</span>

				<span class='text'>-&gt;&lt;ref&gt;After more than two centuries, the exact nature of Gibbon's ailment remains a bone of contention</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Patricia Craddock]], in a very full and graphic account of Gibbon's last days, notes that Sir Gavin de Beer's medical analysis of 1949 &quot;makes it ''certain'' that Gibbon did ''not'' have a true hydrocele</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>nd highly probable that he was suffering both from a 'large and irreducible hernia' and cirrhosis of the liver</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Also worthy of note are Gibbon's congenial and even joking moods while in excruciating pain as he neared the end</span>
				<span class='text'>Both authors report this late bit of Gibbonian bawdiness: &quot;Why is a fat man like a Cornish Borough? Because he never sees his member</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Legacy==Gibbon's work has been criticised for its scathing view of Christianity as laid down in chapters XV and XVI, a situation which resulted in the banning of the book in several countries</span>
				<span class='text'>Gibbon's alleged crime was disrespecting, and none too lightly, the character of sacred Christian doctrine, by &quot;treat[ing] the Christian church as a phenomenon of general history, not a special case admitting supernatural explanations and disallowing criticism of its adherents&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>More specifically, the chapters excoriated the church for &quot;supplanting in an unnecessarily destructive way the great culture that preceded it&quot; and for &quot;the outrage of [practicing] religious intolerance and warfare&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>0; also see Shelby Thomas McCloy, ''Gibbon's Antagonism to Christianity'' (Chapel Hill: Univ</span>
				<span class='text'>of North Carolina Press, 1933)</span>
				<span class='text'>Gibbon, however, began chapter XV with what appeared to be a moderately ''positive'' appraisal of the Church's rise to power and authority</span>
				<span class='text'>Therein he documented one primary and ''five'' secondary causes of the rapid spread of Christianity throughout the Roman Empire: primarily, &quot;the convincing evidence of the doctrine itself, and</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>the ruling providence of its great Author;&quot;  secondarily, &quot;exclusive zeal, the immediate expectation of another world, the claim of miracles, the practice of rigid virtue, and the constitution of the primitive church</span>

				<span class='text'>497</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt;Gibbon, though assumed to be entirely anti-religion, was actually supportive to some extent, insofar as it did not obscure his true endeavour – a history that was not influenced and swayed by official church doctrine</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the most famous two chapters are heavily ironical and cutting about religion, it is not utterly condemned, and its truth and rightness are upheld however thinly</span>
				<span class='text'>ibbon, in letters to Holroyd and others, expected some type of church-inspired backlash, but the utter harshness of the ensuing torrents far exceeded anything he or his friends could possibly have anticipated</span>
				<span class='text'>Contemporary detractors such as [[Joseph Priestley]] and [[Richard Watson (bishop of Llandaff)|Richard Watson]] stoked the nascent fire, but the most severe of these attacks was an &quot;acrimonious&quot; piece by the young cleric, Henry Edwards Davis</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Henry Edwards Davis, ''An Examination of the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Chapters of Mr</span>

				<span class='text'> [https://archive</span>
				<span class='text'>rg/details/anexaminationfi00davigoog online]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Gibbon subsequently published his ''Vindication'' in 1779, in which he categorically denied Davis' &quot;criminal accusations&quot;, branding him a purveyor of &quot;servile plagiarism</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;See [[#Monographs by Gibbon|Gibbon monographs]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Davis followed Gibbon's ''Vindication'' with yet another reply (1779)</span>
				<span class='text'>ibbon's apparent antagonism to Christian doctrine spilled over into the Jewish faith, leading to charges of anti-Semitism</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|reasons=SOME EXAMPLES OF ACCUSATIONS WOULD BE PROFITABLE|date=April 2010}} For example, he wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;From the reign of Nero to that of Antoninus Pius, the Jews discovered a fierce impatience of the dominion of Rome, which repeatedly broke out in the most furious massacres and insurrections</span>
				<span class='text'>Humanity is shocked at the recital of the horrid cruelties which they committed in the cities of Egypt, of Cyprus, and of Cyrene, where they dwelt in treacherous friendship with the unsuspecting natives; and we are tempted to applaud the severe retaliation which was exercised by the arms of legions against a race of fanatics, whose dire and credulous superstition seemed to render them the implacable enemies not only of the Roman government, but also of humankind</span>

				<span class='text'>tm see online] Gibbon's first footnote here reveals even more about why his detractors reacted so harshly: ''In Cyrene, [the Jews] massacred 220,000 Greeks; in Cyprus, 240,000; in Egypt, a very great multitude</span>
				<span class='text'> Many of these unhappy victims were sawed asunder, according to a precedent to which David had given the sanction of his examples</span>
				<span class='text'>The victorious Jews devoured the flesh, licked up the blood, and twisted the entrails like a girdle around their bodies</span>
				<span class='text'>see Dion Cassius l</span>
				<span class='text'>xviii, p</span>
				<span class='text'>1145</span>
				<span class='text'>' As a matter of fact, this is a verbatim citation from [http://cojs</span>
				<span class='text'>rg/cojswiki/Dio_Cassius,_Historia_Romana_LXVIII,_32:1-3:_The_Jewish_Uprising Dio Cassius, Historia Romana LXVIII, 32:1–3: The Jewish Uprising]: ''Meanwhile the Jews in the region of Cyrene had put one Andreas at their head and were destroying both the Romans and the Greeks</span>
				<span class='text'>They would cook their flesh, make belts for themselves of their entrails, anoint themselves with their blood, and wear their skins for clothing</span>
				<span class='text'>Many they sawed in two, from the head downwards</span>
				<span class='text'>Others they would give to wild beasts and force still others to fight as gladiators</span>
				<span class='text'>In all, consequently, two hundred and twenty thousand perished</span>
				<span class='text'>In Egypt, also, they performed many similar deeds, and in Cyprus under the leadership of Artemio</span>
				<span class='text'>There, likewise, two hundred and forty thousand perished</span>
				<span class='text'>For this reason no Jew may set foot in that land, but even if one of them is driven upon the island by force of the wind, he is put to death</span>
				<span class='text'>Various persons took part in subduing these Jews, one being Lusius, who was sent by Trajan</span>
				<span class='text'>'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Gibbon is considered to be a son of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and this is reflected in his famous verdict on the history of the [[Middle Ages]]: &quot;I have described the triumph of barbarism and religion</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; However, politically, he aligned himself with the conservative Edmund Burke's rejection of the democratic movements of the time as well as with Burke's dismissal of the &quot;rights of man</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Burke supported the ''American'' rebellion, while Gibbon sided with the ministry; but with regard to the ''French'' Revolution they shared a perfect revulsion</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite their agreement on the FR, Burke and Gibbon &quot;were not specially close,&quot; owing to Whig party differences and divergent religious beliefs, not to mention Burke's sponsorship of the [[Civil List and Secret Service Money Act 1782]] which abolished, and therefore cost Gibbon his place on, the government's Board of Trade and Plantations in 1782</span>

				<span class='text'>&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;Unusually for the 18th century, Gibbon was never content with secondhand accounts when the primary sources were accessible (though most of these were drawn from well-known printed editions)</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;I have always endeavoured,&quot; he says, &quot;to draw from the fountain-head; that my curiosity, as well as a sense of duty, has always urged me to study the originals; and that, if they have sometimes eluded my search, I have carefully marked the secondary evidence, on whose faith a passage or a fact were reduced to depend</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In this insistence upon the importance of primary sources, Gibbon is considered by many to be one of the first modern historians:&lt;blockquote&gt;In accuracy, thoroughness, lucidity, and comprehensive grasp of a vast subject, the 'History' is unsurpassable</span>
				<span class='text'>It is the one English history which may be regarded as definitive</span>

				<span class='text'>1134</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The subject of Gibbon's writing as well as his ideas and style have influenced other writers</span>
				<span class='text'>Besides his influence on Churchill, Gibbon was also a model for [[Isaac Asimov]] in his writing of ''[[The Foundation Series|The Foundation Trilogy]]'', which he said involved &quot;a little bit of cribbin' from the works of Edward Gibbon&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=May 2013}}[[Evelyn Waugh]] admired Gibbon's style but not his secular viewpoint</span>
				<span class='text'>In Waugh's 1950 novel ''[[Helena (1950 novel)|Helena]]'', the early Christian author [[Lactantius]] worried about the possibility of &quot;'a false historian, with the mind of [[Cicero]] or [[Tacitus]] and the soul of an animal,' and he nodded towards the [[gibbon]] who fretted his golden chain and chattered for fruit</span>
