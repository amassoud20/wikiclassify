				<span class='text'> Erwählter Römischer Kaiser}}) (12 February 1768&amp;nbsp;– 2 March 1835) was the last [[Holy Roman Emperor]], ruling from 1792 until 6 August 1806, when he dissolved the [[Holy Roman Empire]] after the decisive defeat at the hands of the [[First French Empire]] led by [[Napoleon]] at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1804, he had founded the [[Austrian Empire]] and became '''Francis I''' (''Franz I</span>
				<span class='text'>'), the first [[Emperor of Austria]] (''Kaiser von Österreich''), ruling from 1804 to 1835, so later he was named the one and only ''Doppelkaiser'' (double emperor) in history</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Posse|1909–13|pp=256ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;For the two years between 1804 and 1806, Francis used the title and style ''by the grace of God elected Roman Emperor, ever Augustus, hereditary Emperor of Austria'' and he was called the ''Emperor of both the Holy Roman Empire and Austria''</span>
				<span class='text'>He was also [[King of Hungary|Apostolic King of Hungary]] and [[King of Bohemia|Bohemia]] as Francis I</span>
				<span class='text'>He also served as the first president of the [[German Confederation]] following its establishment in 1815</span>
				<span class='text'>rancis II continued his leading role as an opponent of Napoleonic France in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and suffered several more defeats after Austerlitz</span>
				<span class='text'>The proxy marriage of state of his daughter [[Marie Louise of Austria]] to Napoleon on 10 March 1810 was arguably his most severe personal defeat</span>
				<span class='text'>After the abdication of Napoleon following the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]], Austria participated as a leading member of the [[Holy Alliance]] at the [[Congress of Vienna]], which was largely dominated by Francis's chancellor [[Klemens Wenzel, Prince von Metternich]] culminating in a new European map and the restoration of Francis' ancient dominions (except the Holy Roman Empire which was dissolved)</span>
				<span class='text'>Due to the establishment of the [[Concert of Europe]], which largely resisted popular [[nationalism|nationalist]] and liberal tendencies, Francis became viewed as a [[reactionary]] later in his reign</span>
				<span class='text'>= Early life ==[[File:Archduke Franz Joseph Karl (1770)</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|180px|left|Francis II at the age of 2, 1770</span>
				<span class='text'>by [[Anton Raphael Mengs]]]]Francis was a son of [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold II]] (1747–1792) and his wife [[Maria Luisa of Spain]] (1745–1792), daughter of [[Charles III of Spain]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Francis was born in [[Florence]], the capital of [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscany]], where his father reigned as [[Grand Duke of Tuscany|Grand Duke]] from 1765–90</span>
				<span class='text'> Though he had a happy childhood surrounded by his many siblings,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheatcroft|2009|p=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; his family knew Francis was likely to be a future Emperor (his uncle [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph]] had no surviving issue from either of his two marriages), and so in 1784 the young Archduke was sent to the Imperial Court in [[Vienna]] to educate and prepare him for his future role</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=wheatcroft234&gt;{{harvnb|Wheatcroft|2009|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]] himself took charge of Francis's development</span>
				<span class='text'> His disciplinarian regime was a stark contrast to the indulgent Florentine Court of Leopold</span>
				<span class='text'> The Emperor wrote that Francis was &quot;stunted in growth&quot;, &quot;backward in bodily dexterity and deportment&quot;, and &quot;neither more nor less than a spoiled mother's child&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'> Joseph concluded that &quot;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>he manner in which he was treated for upwards of sixteen years could not but have confirmed him in the delusion that the preservation of his own person was the only thing of importance</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=wheatcroft234/&gt;Joseph's [[martinet]] method of improving the young Francis were &quot;fear and unpleasantness&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheatcroft|2009|p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The young Archduke was isolated, the reasoning being that this would make him more self-sufficient as it was felt by Joseph that Francis &quot;fail[ed] to lead himself, to do his own thinking&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'> Nonetheless, Francis greatly admired his uncle, if rather feared him</span>
				<span class='text'> To complete his training, Francis was sent to join an army regiment in [[Hungary]] and he settled easily into the routine of military life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheatcroft|2009|p=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;After the death of Joseph II in 1790, Francis's father became Emperor</span>
				<span class='text'> He had an early taste of power while acting as Leopold's deputy in Vienna while the incoming Emperor traversed the Empire attempting to win back those alienated by his brother's policies</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheatcroft|2009|p=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The strain told on Leopold and by the winter of 1791, he became ill</span>
				<span class='text'> He gradually worsened throughout early 1792; on the afternoon of 1 March Leopold died, at the relatively young age of 44</span>
				<span class='text'> Francis, just past his 24th birthday, was now Emperor, much sooner than he had expected</span>
				<span class='text'>= Emperor ==[[File:Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor at age 25, 1792</span>
				<span class='text'>ng|thumb|200px|left|Francis II at age 25, 1792]]As the leader of the large multi-ethnic [[Habsburg Empire]], Francis felt threatened by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's]] social and political reforms, which were being exported throughout Europe with the expansion of the first French Empire</span>
				<span class='text'>Francis had a fraught relationship with [[France]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His aunt [[Marie Antoinette of Austria|Marie Antoinette]], the wife of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] and Queen consort of France, had been guillotined by the revolutionaries at the beginning of his reign</span>
				<span class='text'> Francis, on the whole, was indifferent to her fate (she was not close to his father, Leopold, and although Francis had met her, he had been too young at the time to have any memory of his aunt)</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Georges Danton]] attempted to negotiate with the Emperor for Marie Antoinette's release, but Francis was unwilling to make any concessions in return</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fraser|2002|p=492}}&lt;/ref&gt;Later, he led Austria into the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He briefly commanded the Allied forces during the [[Flanders Campaign]] of 1794 before handing over command to his brother [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was later defeated by Napoleon</span>
				<span class='text'>By the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]], he ceded the left bank of the [[Rhine]] to [[First French Republic|France]] in exchange for [[Venice]] and [[Dalmatia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He again fought against France during the [[War of the Second Coalition|Second]] and [[War of the Third Coalition|Third Coalition]], when after meeting a crushing defeat at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]], he had to agree to the [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]], weakening the [[Austrian Empire]] and reorganizing [[Germany]] under a Napoleonic imprint that would be called the [[Confederation of the Rhine]]</span>
				<span class='text'>At this point, he believed his position as Holy Roman Emperor to be untenable, so on 6 August 1806, he abdicated the throne</span>
				<span class='text'> He had anticipated losing the Holy Roman crown, however</span>
				<span class='text'> Two years earlier, as a reaction to Napoleon making himself an emperor, he had raised Austria to the status of an empire</span>
				<span class='text'> Hence, after 1806, he reigned as Francis I, Emperor of Austria</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Reich1905&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Reich|1905|p=622}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:1839 Krafft Siegesmeldung nach der Schlacht bei Leipzig 1813 anagoria</span>
				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|240px|Francis, [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] of Russia and [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick III]] of Prussia after the [[battle of Leipzig]], 1813]]In 1809, Francis attacked France again, hoping to take advantage of the [[Peninsular War]] embroiling Napoleon in [[Spain]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was again defeated, and this time forced to ally himself with Napoleon, ceding territory to the Empire, joining the [[Continental System]], and wedding his daughter [[Marie Louise of Austria|Marie-Louise]] to the Emperor</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Napoleonic wars]] drastically weakened Austria and threatened its preeminence among the states of Germany, a position that it would eventually cede to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1813, for the fourth and final time, Austria turned against France and joined [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], Prussia and [[Sweden]] in their [[Sixth Coalition|war against Napoleon]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Austria played a major role in the final defeat of France—in recognition of this, Francis, represented by [[Clemens von Metternich]], presided over the [[Congress of Vienna]], helping to form the [[Concert of Europe]] and the [[Holy Alliance]], ushering in an era of [[conservatism]] in Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[German Confederation]], a loose association of [[Central Europe]]an states was created by the Congress of Vienna in 1815 to organize the surviving states of the Holy Roman Empire</span>
				<span class='text'> The Congress was a personal triumph for Francis, who hosted the assorted dignitaries in comfort,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheatcroft|2009|p=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Francis undermined his allies [[Alexander I of Russia|Tsar Alexander]] and [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] by negotiating a secret treaty with the restored French king [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheatcroft|2009|p=250}}&lt;/ref&gt;The federal [[Diet (assembly)|Diet]] met at [[Frankfurt]] under Austrian [[presidency]] (in fact the Habsburg Emperor was represented by an Austrian &quot;presidential envoy&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>= Domestic policy ==[[File:Friedrich von Amerling 003</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|200px|right|Emperor Franz I (painting by [[Friedrich von Amerling]], 1832)</span>
				<span class='text'>]The violent events of the French Revolution impressed themselves deeply into the mind of Francis (as well as all other European monarchs), and he came to distrust radicalism in any form</span>
				<span class='text'> In 1794, a &quot;[[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]]&quot; conspiracy was discovered in the Austrian and Hungarian armies</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheatcroft|2009|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The leaders were put on trial, but the verdicts only skirted the perimeter of the conspiracy</span>
				<span class='text'> Francis's brother [[Archduke Alexander Leopold of Austria|Alexander Leopold]] (at that time [[Palatine of Hungary]]) wrote to the Emperor admitting &quot;Although we have caught a lot of the culprits, we have not really got to the bottom of this business yet</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;  Nonetheless, two officers heavily implicated in the conspiracy were [[hanging|hanged]] and [[gibbet]]ed, while numerous others were sentenced to imprisonment (many of whom died from the conditions)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=wheatcroft240&gt;{{harvnb|Wheatcroft|2009|p=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;Francis was from his experiences suspicious and set up an extensive network of police spies and censors to monitor dissent&lt;ref name=wheatcroft240/&gt; (in this he was following his father's lead, as the Grand Duchy of Tuscany had the most effective secret police in Europe)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=wheatcroft234/&gt;  Even his family did not escape attention</span>
				<span class='text'> His brothers, the Archdukes [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Charles]] and [[Archduke Johann of Austria|Johann]] had their meetings and activities spied upon</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheatcroft|2009|p=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Censorship was also prevalent</span>
				<span class='text'> The author [[Franz Grillparzer]], a Habsburg patriot, had one play suppressed solely as a &quot;precautionary&quot; measure</span>
				<span class='text'> When Grillparzer met the censor responsible, he asked him what was objectionable about the work</span>
				<span class='text'> The censor replied, &quot;Oh, nothing at all</span>
				<span class='text'> But I thought to myself, 'One can never tell'</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheatcroft|2009|p=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;In military affairs Francis had allowed his brother, the [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles]], extensive control over the army during the Napoleonic wars</span>
				<span class='text'> Yet, distrustful of allowing any individual too much power, he otherwise maintained the separation of command functions between the [[Hofkriegsrat]] and his field commanders</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rothenburg|1976|p= 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the later years of his reign he limited military spending, requiring it not exceed forty millions [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|florins]]{{disambiguation needed|date=March 2013}} per year; because of [[inflation]] this resulted in inadequate funding, with the army's share of the budget shrinking from half in 1817 to only twenty-three percent in 1830</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Rothenburg|1976|p=10}}Francis presented himself as an open and approachable monarch (he regularly set aside two mornings each week to meet his imperial subjects, regardless of status, by appointment in his office, even speaking to them in their own language),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheatcroft|2009|p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; but his will was sovereign</span>
				<span class='text'> In 1804, he had no compunction about announcing that through his authority as Holy Roman Emperor, he declared he was now Emperor of Austria (at the time a geographical term that had little resonance)</span>
				<span class='text'> Two years later, Francis personally wound up the moribund Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation</span>
				<span class='text'> Both actions were of dubious constitutional legality</span>
