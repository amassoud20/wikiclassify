				<span class='text'>The company had been organized in 1928 and would run until 1932, with [[Joshua Logan]], [[Bretaigne Windust]] and Charles Leatherbee as directors</span>
				<span class='text'>Stewart performed in bit parts in the Players' productions in Cape Cod during the summer of 1932, after he graduated</span>

				<span class='text'>By the time Stewart joined the University Players on Cape Cod after his graduation from Princeton in 1932, Fonda and Sullavan's brief marriage had ended</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; When Stewart came to New York at the end of the summer stock season, which had included the Broadway tryout of ''Goodbye Again'', he shared an apartment with Fonda, who had by then finalized his divorce from Sullavan</span>
				<span class='text'>Along with fellow University Players [[Alfred Dalrymple]] and [[Myron McCormick]], Stewart debuted on Broadway in the brief run of ''[[Carry Nation (play)|Carry Nation]]'' and a few weeks later – again with McCormick and Dalrymple – as a chauffeur in the comedy ''Goodbye Again'', in which he had two lines</span>

				<span class='text'>However, Stewart and Fonda, still roommates, were both struggling</span>
				<span class='text'>In the fall of 1934, Fonda's success in ''[[The Farmer Takes a Wife]]'' took him to [[Hollywood]]</span>

				<span class='text'>With Fonda's encouragement, Stewart agreed to take a screen test, after which he signed a contract with MGM in April 1935, as a contract player for up to seven years at $350 a week</span>

				<span class='text'>Stewart's first job at the studio was as a participant in screen tests with newly arrived starlets</span>
				<span class='text'>At first, he had trouble being cast in Hollywood films owing to his gangling looks and shy, humble screen presence</span>
				<span class='text'>Aside from an unbilled appearance in a [[Shemp Howard]] comedy [[short subject|short]] called ''[[Art Trouble]]'' in 1934, his first film was the poorly received [[Spencer Tracy]] vehicle, ''[[The Murder Man]]'' (1935)</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The romance soon cooled, however, and by chance Stewart encountered Margaret Sullavan again</span>
				<span class='text'>Stewart found his footing in Hollywood thanks largely to Sullavan, who campaigned for Stewart to be her [[leading man]] in the 1936 romantic comedy ''[[Next Time We Love]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>She rehearsed extensively with him, having a noticeable effect on his confidence</span>
				<span class='text'>She encouraged Stewart to feel comfortable with his unique mannerisms and boyish charm and use them naturally as his own style</span>

				<span class='text'>The director had recently completed several popular movies, including ''[[It Happened One Night]]'' (1934), and was looking for the right actor to suit his needs—other recent actors in Capra's films such as [[Clark Gable]], [[Ronald Colman]], and [[Gary Cooper]] did not quite fit</span>
				<span class='text'>Not only was Stewart just what he was looking for, but Capra also found Stewart understood that prototype intuitively and required very little directing</span>

				<span class='text'>Five of them were [[Western (genre)|Westerns]], including ''[[The Naked Spur]]'' (1953)</span>
				<span class='text'>]Other Stewart–Mann westerns, such as ''[[Bend of the River]]'' ([[1952 in film|1952]]), ''[[The Naked Spur]]'' ([[1953 in film|1953]]), ''[[The Far Country]]'' ([[1954 in film|1954]]) and ''[[The Man from Laramie]]'' ([[1955 in film|1955]]), were perennial favorites among young audiences entranced by the [[American West]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Frequently, the films featured Stewart as a troubled cowboy seeking redemption, while facing corrupt cattlemen, ranchers and outlaws—a man who knows violence first hand and struggles to control it</span>
				<span class='text'>The Stewart–Mann collaborations laid the foundation for many of the westerns of the 1950s and remain popular today for their grittier, more realistic depiction of the classic movie genre</span>
