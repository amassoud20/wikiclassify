				<span class='text'>In [[Anno Domini|AD]]&amp;nbsp;325 Nonna converted her husband, a [[Hypsistarian]], to Christianity; he was subsequently ordained as bishop of Nazianzus in 328 or 329</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;McGuckin&quot; /&gt;{{rp |vii}}  The young Gregory and his brother, [[Caesarius of Nazianzus|Caesarius]], first studied at home with their uncle Amphylokhios</span>
				<span class='text'>Gregory went on to study advanced rhetoric and philosophy in Nazianzus, [[Caesarea Mazaca|Caesarea]], [[Alexandria]] and [[Athens]]</span>
				<span class='text'>On the way to Athens his ship encountered a violent storm, and the terrified Gregory prayed to Christ that if He would deliver him, he would dedicate his life to His service</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;McGuckin&quot; /&gt;{{rp |28}}  While at Athens, he developed a close friendship with his fellow student [[Basil of Caesarea]] and also made the acquaintance of [[Flavius Claudius Julianus]], who would later become the emperor known as [[Julian the Apostate]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;Ruether&quot; /&gt;{{rp |19,25}}  In Athens, Gregory studied under the famous rhetoricians [[Himerius]] and [[Proaeresius]]</span>

				<span class='text'>==Priesthood===In 361 Gregory returned to Nazianzus and was ordained a [[presbyter]] by his father, who wanted him to assist with caring for local Christians</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;McGuckin&quot; /&gt;{{rp |99–102}}  The younger Gregory, who had been considering a monastic existence, resented his father's decision to force him to choose between priestly services and a solitary existence, calling it an &quot;act of tyranny&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>45&lt;/ref&gt;  Leaving home after a few days, he met his friend Basil at Annesoi, where the two lived as ascetics</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;McGuckin&quot; /&gt;{{rp |102}}  However, Basil urged him to return home to assist his father, which he did for the next year</span>
				<span class='text'>Arriving at Nazianzus, Gregory found the local Christian community split by theological differences and his father accused of heresy by local monks</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;McGuckin&quot; /&gt;{{rp |107}}  Gregory helped to heal the division through a combination of personal diplomacy and oratory</span>
				<span class='text'>y this time Emperor Julian had publicly declared himself in opposition to Christianity</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;McGuckin&quot; /&gt;{{rp |115}}  In response to the emperor's rejection of the Christian faith, Gregory composed his ''Invectives Against Julian'' between 362 and 363</span>
				<span class='text'>''Invectives'' asserts that Christianity will overcome imperfect rulers such as Julian through love and patience</span>
				<span class='text'>This process as described by Gregory is the public manifestation of the process of deification (''[[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]]''), which leads to a spiritual elevation and mystical union with God</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;McGuckin&quot; /&gt;{{rp |121}}  Julian resolved, in late 362, to vigorously prosecute Gregory and his other Christian critics; however, the emperor perished the following year during a campaign against the Persians</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;McGuckin&quot; /&gt;{{rp |125–6}}  With the death of the emperor, Gregory and the Eastern churches were no longer under the threat of persecution, as the new emperor [[Jovian (Emperor)|Jovian]] was an avowed Christian and supporter of the church</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;McGuckin&quot; /&gt;{{rp |130}}Gregory spent the next few years combating [[Arianism]], which threatened to divide the region of Cappadocia</span>
				<span class='text'>In this tense environment, Gregory interceded on behalf of his friend Basil with Bishop Eusebius of Caesarea ([[Caesarea Mazaca|Mazaca]])</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;McGuckin&quot; /&gt;{{rp |138–42}}  The two friends then entered a period of close fraternal cooperation as they participated in a great rhetorical contest of the Caesarean church precipitated by the arrival of accomplished Arian theologians and rhetors</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;McGuckin&quot; /&gt;{{rp |143}}  In the subsequent public debates, presided over by agents of the Emperor [[Valens]], Gregory and Basil emerged triumphant</span>
				<span class='text'> This success confirmed for both Gregory and Basil that their futures lay in administration of the Church</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;McGuckin&quot; /&gt;{{rp |143}}  Basil, who had long displayed inclinations to the episcopacy, was elected bishop of the see of [[Caesarea Mazaca|Caesarea in Cappadocia]] in 370</span>
				<span class='text'>==Episcopate in Sasima and Nazianzus===Gregory was ordained Bishop of [[Sasima]] in 372 by Basil</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;McGuckin&quot; /&gt;{{rp |190–5}}  Basil created this [[Episcopal see|see]] in order to strengthen his position in his dispute with [[Anthimus of Tyana|Anthimus]], bishop of [[Tyana]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;Hunter-Blair&quot; /&gt; The ambitions of Gregory's father to have his son rise in the Church hierarchy and the insistence of his friend Basil convinced Gregory to accept this position despite his reservations</span>
				<span class='text'>Gregory would later refer to his episcopal ordination as forced upon him by his strong-willed father and Basil</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;McGuckin&quot; /&gt;{{rp |187–92}} Describing his new bishopric, Gregory lamented how it was nothing more than an &quot;utterly dreadful, pokey little hole; a paltry horse-stop on the main road&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>devoid of water, vegetation, or the company of gentlemen&amp;nbsp;</span>

				<span class='text'>439–46</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  He made little effort to administer his new diocese, complaining to Basil that he preferred instead to pursue a contemplative life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;Ruether&quot; /&gt;{{rp |38–9}}By late 372 Gregory returned to Nazianzus to assist his dying father with the administration of his diocese</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;McGuckin&quot; /&gt;{{rp |199}}  This strained his relationship with Basil, who insisted that Gregory resume his post at Sasima</span>
				<span class='text'>Gregory retorted that he had no intention to continue to play the role of pawn to advance Basil's interests</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He instead focused his attention on his new duties as [[co-adjutor]] of Nazianzus</span>
				<span class='text'>It was here that Gregory preached the first of his great episcopal orations</span>
				<span class='text'>ollowing the deaths of his mother and father in 374, Gregory continued to administer the Diocese of Nazianzus but refused to be named bishop</span>
				<span class='text'>Donating most of his inheritance to the needy, he lived an austere existence</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;Hunter-Blair&quot; /&gt;  At the end of 375 he withdrew to a monastery at [[Silifke|Seleukia]], living there for three years</span>
				<span class='text'>Near the end of this period his friend Basil died</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Gregory's health did not permit him to attend the funeral, he wrote a heartfelt letter of condolence to Basil's brother, [[Gregory of Nyssa]] and composed twelve memorial poems dedicated to the memory of his departed friend</span>

				<span class='text'>The accession of [[Theodosius I]], a steadfast supporter of Nicene orthodoxy, was good news to those who wished to purge Constantinople of [[Arianism|Arian]] and [[Apollinarism|Apollinarian]] domination</span>

				<span class='text'>From his deathbed, Basil reminded them of Gregory's capabilities and likely recommended his friend to champion the trinitarian cause in Constantinople</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In 379, the Antioch synod and its archbishop, Meletios, asked Gregory to go to Constantinople to lead a theological campaign to win over that city to Nicene orthodoxy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;Ruether&quot; /&gt;{{rp |42}}  After much hesitation, Gregory agreed</span>

				<span class='text'>Fearing his popularity, his opponents decided to strike</span>
				<span class='text'>On the [[Easter Eve|vigil of Easter]] in 379, an Arian mob burst into his church during worship services, wounding Gregory and killing another bishop</span>
				<span class='text'>Escaping the mob, Gregory next found himself betrayed by his erstwhile friend, the philosopher [[Maximus I of Constantinople|Maximus the Cynic]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Maximus, who was in secret alliance with Peter, bishop of Alexandria, attempted to seize Gregory's position and have himself ordained bishop of Constantinople</span>

				<span class='text'>However, the episode left him embarrassed and exposed him to criticism as a provincial simpleton unable to cope with intrigues of the imperial city</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ruether&quot; /&gt;{{rp |43}}Affairs in Constantinople remained confused as Gregory's position was still unofficial and Arian priests occupied many important churches</span>
				<span class='text'>The arrival of the emperor Theodosius in 380 settled matters in Gregory's favor</span>
				<span class='text'> The emperor, determined to eliminate Arianism, expelled [[Demophilus of Constantinople|Bishop Demophilus]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ruether&quot; /&gt;{{rp |45}}  Gregory was of similar mind in wishing to unify Christianity</span>
				<span class='text'>In the spring of 381 they convened the [[First Council of Constantinople|Second Ecumenical Council]] in Constantinople, which was attended by 150 Eastern bishops</span>
				<span class='text'> After the death of the presiding bishop, [[Meletius of Antioch]], Gregory was selected to lead the Council</span>
				<span class='text'>Hoping to reconcile the West with the East, he offered to recognize [[Paulinus, Bishop of Antioch|Paulinus]] as Patriarch of Antioch</span>
				<span class='text'>The Egyptian and Macedonian bishops who had supported Maximus's ordination arrived late for the Council</span>

				<span class='text'>The Council asked him to appear once more for a farewell ritual and celebratory orations</span>

				<span class='text'>Should he pursue studies as a rhetor or philosopher? Would a monastic life be more appropriate than public ministry? Was it better to blaze his own path or follow the course mapped for him by his father and Basil? Gregory's writings illuminate the conflicts which both tormented and motivated him</span>

				<span class='text'>]===Theological and other works===Gregory's most significant theological contributions arose from his defense of the doctrine of the [[Trinity]]</span>
				<span class='text'> He is especially noted for his contributions to the field of [[Pneumatology (Christianity)|pneumatology]]—that is, theology concerning the nature of the [[Holy Spirit]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Michael O'Carroll, &quot;Gregory of Nazianzus&quot; in ''Trinitas'' (Wilmington, DE: Michael Glazier, 1987)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In this regard, Gregory is the first to use the idea of ''procession'' to describe the relationship between the Spirit and the Godhead: &quot;The Holy Spirit is truly Spirit, coming forth from the Father indeed but not after the manner of the Son, for it is not by generation but by ''procession'', since I must coin a word for the sake of clearness</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gregory of Nazianzus, ''Five Theological Orations'', oration five</span>
				<span class='text'>This fifth oration deals entirely with the Holy Spirit</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Although Gregory does not fully develop the concept, the idea of procession would shape most later thought about the Holy Spirit</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;HEW Turner and Francis Young, &quot;Procession(s)&quot; in ''The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology'', ed</span>
				<span class='text'>A</span>
				<span class='text'>Richardson &amp; J</span>
				<span class='text'>Bowden (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1983)</span>
				<span class='text'>Through Augustine, the idea would develop in the West into &quot;double-procession,&quot; resulting in the ''[[Filioque clause]]'' and the split between Eastern and Western Christianity</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;He emphasized that Jesus did not cease to be God when he became a man, nor did he lose any of his divine attributes when he took on human nature</span>
				<span class='text'>Furthermore, Gregory asserted that Christ was fully human, including a full human soul</span>
				<span class='text'>He also proclaimed the eternality of the Holy Spirit, saying that the Holy Spirit's actions were somewhat hidden in the [[Old Testament]] but much clearer since the ascension of Jesus into Heaven and the descent of the Holy Spirit at the feast of Pentecost</span>
				<span class='text'>n contrast to the Neo-Arian belief that the Son is ''anomoios'', or &quot;unlike&quot; the Father, and with the [[Semi-Arian]] assertion that the Son is ''[[homoiousios]]'', or &quot;like&quot; the Father, Gregory and his fellow Cappadocians maintained the Nicaean doctrine of ''[[Homoousian|homoousia]]'', or [[consubstantiality]] of the Son with the Father</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;Børtnes&quot;&gt;{{citation | last = Børtnes | year = 2006}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;{{rp |9,10}}  The Cappadocian Fathers asserted that God's nature is unknowable to man; helped to develop the framework of ''[[hypostases]]'', or three persons united in a single Godhead; illustrated how Jesus is the [[icon|eikon]] of the Father; and explained the concept of ''[[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]]'', the belief that all Christians can be assimilated with God in &quot;imitation of the incarnate Son as the divine model</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Børtnes&quot; /&gt;{{rp |10}}Some of Gregory's theological writings suggest that, like his friend [[Gregory of Nyssa]], he may have supported some form of the doctrine of [[apocatastasis]], the belief that God will bring all of creation into harmony with the Kingdom of Heaven</span>

				<span class='text'>Boston and Chicago Universalist Publishing House, 1899</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This view of Gregory is also held by some modern theologians, such as [[John Sachs]] who said that Gregory had &quot;leanings&quot; toward apocatastasis, but in a &quot;cautious, undogmatic&quot; way</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Sachs, John R</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Apocatastasis in Patristic Theology</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Theological Studies</span>
				<span class='text'>54 (December 1993), p</span>
				<span class='text'>632</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  However, it is not clear or universally accepted that Gregory held to the doctrine of apocatastasis</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;David L</span>
				<span class='text'>Balas, &quot;Apokatastasis&quot; in ''The Encyclopedia of Early Christianity'', second edition, ed</span>
				<span class='text'>Everett Ferguson (New York: Garland Publishing, 1997), details [[Gregory of Nyssa]]'s adherence to the doctrine, while making no mention of Nazianzan</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Apart from the several theological discourses, Gregory was also one of the most important early Christian men of letters, a very accomplished orator, perhaps one of the greatest of his time,&lt;ref name = &quot;Børtnes&quot; /&gt;{{rp |21}} and also a very prolific poet, writing several poems with theological and moral matter and some with biographical content</span>
				<span class='text'>==Influence===Gregory's great nephew Nichobulos served as his literary executor, preserving and editing many of his writings</span>
				<span class='text'>A cousin, Eulalios, published several of Gregory's more noteworthy works in 391</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;McGuckin&quot; /&gt;{{rp |xi}}  By 400, Rufinius began translating his orations into Latin</span>
				<span class='text'>As Gregory's works circulated throughout the empire they influenced theological thought</span>
				<span class='text'>His orations were cited as authoritative by the [[First Council of Ephesus]] in 431</span>
				<span class='text'>By 451 he was designated ''Theologus'', or Theologian by the [[Council of Chalcedon]]&lt;ref name=&quot;McGuckin&quot; /&gt;{{rp |xi}} — a title held by no others save [[John the Apostle]]&lt;ref name = &quot;Hunter-Blair&quot; /&gt; and [[Symeon the New Theologian]] (949–1022 AD)</span>
				<span class='text'>He is widely quoted by Eastern Orthodox theologians and highly regarded as a defender of the Christian faith</span>
				<span class='text'>His contributions to [[Trinitarian theology]] are also influential and often cited in the Western churches</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See how the 1992 edition of the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] cites a variety of Gregory's orations&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Paul Tillich]] credits Gregory of Nazianzus for having &quot;created the definitive formulae for the doctrine of the trinity&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>On  November 27, 2004, those relics, along with those of [[John Chrysostom]], were returned to [[Istanbul]] ([[Constantinople]]) by [[Pope John Paul II]], with the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] retaining a small portion of both</span>

				<span class='text'>These include a valuable autobiographical poem of nearly 2,000 lines; about one hundred other shorter poems relating to his past career; and a large number of epitaphs, epigrams, and epistles to well-known people during that era</span>
				<span class='text'>The poems that he wrote that dealt with his personal affairs refer to the continuous illness and severe sufferings (physical and spiritual) which assailed him during his last years</span>
				<span class='text'>In the tiny plot of ground at [[Arianzus]], all that remained to him of his rich inheritance was by a fountain near which there was a shady walk</span>
				<span class='text'>At this point, Gregory retired to spend his days as a hermit</span>
				<span class='text'>It was at this point he decided to write theological discourses and poetry of both a religious and an autobiographical nature</span>
