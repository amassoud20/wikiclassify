				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|350px|left|Rutherford at McGill University in 1905]]At Cambridge, Rutherford started to work with J</span>
				<span class='text'>J</span>
				<span class='text'>Thomson on the conductive effects of X-rays on gases, work which led to the discovery of the [[electron]] which Thomson presented to the world in 1897</span>
				<span class='text'>Hearing of [[Henri Becquerel|Becquerel]]'s experience with [[uranium]], Rutherford started to explore its [[radioactivity]], discovering two types that differed from X-rays in their penetrating power</span>
				<span class='text'>Continuing his research in Canada, he coined the terms [[alpha ray]] and [[beta ray]] in 1899 to describe the two distinct types of [[radioactivity|radiation]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He then discovered that [[thorium]] gave off a gas which produced an emanation which was itself radioactive and would coat other substances</span>
				<span class='text'>He found that a sample of this radioactive material of any size invariably took the same amount of time for half the sample to decay – its &quot;[[half-life]]&quot; (11½ minutes in this case)</span>
				<span class='text'>rom 1900 to 1903, he was joined at McGill by the young chemist [[Frederick Soddy]] ([[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]], 1921) for whom he set the problem of identifying the thorium emanations</span>
				<span class='text'>Once he had eliminated all the normal chemical reactions, Soddy suggested that it must be one of the inert gases, which they named [[thoron]] (later found to be an isotope of [[radon]])</span>
				<span class='text'>They also found another type of thorium they called Thorium X, and kept on finding traces of helium</span>
				<span class='text'>They also worked with samples of &quot;Uranium X&quot; from [[William Crookes]] and [[radium]] from [[Marie Curie]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1902, they produced a &quot;Theory of Atomic Disintegration&quot; to account for all their experiments</span>
				<span class='text'>Up till then atoms were assumed to be the indestructable basis of all matter and although Curie had suggested that radioactivity was an atomic phenomenon, the idea of the atoms of radioactive substances breaking up was a radically new idea</span>
				<span class='text'>Rutherford and Soddy demonstrated that radioactivity involved the spontaneous disintegration of [[atom]]s into other types of atoms (one element spontaneously being changed to another)</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1903, Rutherford considered a type of radiation discovered (but not named) by French chemist [[Paul Villard]] in 1900, as an emission from [[radium]], and realised that this observation must represent something different from his own alpha and beta rays, due to its very much greater penetrating power</span>
				<span class='text'>Rutherford therefore gave this third type of radiation the name of [[gamma ray]]</span>
				<span class='text'>All three of Rutherford's terms are in standard use today – other types of [[radioactive decay]] have since been discovered, but Rutherford's three types are among the most common</span>
				<span class='text'>n Manchester, he continued to work with alpha radiation</span>
				<span class='text'>In conjunction with [[Hans Geiger]], he developed zinc sulfide [[zinc sulfide|scintillation screens]] and ionisation chambers to count alphas</span>
				<span class='text'>By dividing the total charge they produced by the number counted, Rutherford decided that the charge on the alpha was two</span>
				<span class='text'>In late 1907, Ernest Rutherford and [[Thomas Royds]] allowed alphas to penetrate a very thin window into an evacuated tube</span>
				<span class='text'>As they [[atomic emission spectroscopy|sparked the tube into discharge]], the spectrum obtained from it changed, as the alphas accumulated in the tube</span>
				<span class='text'>Eventually, the clear spectrum of helium gas appeared, proving that alphas were at least ionised helium atoms, and probably helium nuclei</span>
				<span class='text'>==Gold foil experiment===[[File:Gold foil experiment conclusions</span>
				<span class='text'>vg|right|thumb|''Top:'' Expected results: [[alpha particle]]s passing through the [[plum pudding model]] of the atom undisturbed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;br&gt;''Bottom:'' Observed results: a small portion of the particles were deflected, indicating [[Atomic nucleus|a small, concentrated charge]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Note that the image is not to scale; in reality the nucleus is vastly smaller than the electron shell</span>
				<span class='text'>]Rutherford performed his most famous work ''after'' receiving the Nobel prize in 1908</span>
				<span class='text'>Along with [[Hans Geiger]] and [[Ernest Marsden]] in 1909, he carried out the [[Geiger–Marsden experiment]], which demonstrated the nuclear nature of atoms by deflecting [[alpha particles]] passing through a thin gold foil</span>
				<span class='text'>Rutherford was inspired to ask Geiger and Marsden in this experiment to look for alpha particles with very high deflection angles, of a type not expected from any theory of matter at that time</span>
				<span class='text'>Such deflections, though rare, were found, and proved to be a smooth but high-order function of the deflection angle</span>
				<span class='text'>It was Rutherford's interpretation of this data that led him to formulate the [[Rutherford model]] of the atom in 1911 – that a very small [[charge (physics)|charged]] &lt;ref name=charge /&gt; [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]], containing much of the atom's mass, was [[orbit]]ed by low-mass [[electron]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>efore leaving Manchester in 1919 to take over the Cavendish laboratory in Cambridge, Rutherford became, in 1919, the first person to deliberately transmute one [[chemical element|element]] into another</span>

				<span class='text'>rg|accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this experiment, he had discovered peculiar radiations when alphas were projected into air, and narrowed the effect down to the nitrogen, not the oxygen in the air</span>
				<span class='text'>Using pure nitrogen, Rutherford used alpha radiation to convert [[nitrogen]] into [[oxygen]] through the [[nuclear reaction]] &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N + α → &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O + proton</span>
				<span class='text'>The proton was not then known</span>
				<span class='text'>In the products of this reaction Rutherford simply identified hydrogen nuclei, by their similarity to the particle radiation from earlier experiments in which he had bombarded hydrogen gas with alpha particles to knock hydrogen nuclei out of hydrogen atoms</span>
				<span class='text'>This result showed Rutherford that hydrogen nuclei were a part of nitrogen nuclei (and by inference, probably other nuclei as well)</span>
				<span class='text'>Such a construction had been suspected for many years on the basis of atomic weights which were whole numbers of that of hydrogen; see [[Prout's hypothesis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Hydrogen was known to be the lightest element, and its nuclei presumably the lightest nuclei</span>
				<span class='text'>Now, because of all these considerations, Rutherford decided that a hydrogen nucleus was possibly a fundamental building block of all nuclei, and also possibly a new fundamental particle as well, since nothing was known from the nucleus that was lighter</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, Rutherford postulated hydrogen nuclei to be a new particle in 1920, which he dubbed the ''[[proton]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1921, while working with [[Niels Bohr]] (who postulated that electrons moved in specific orbits), Rutherford theorized about the existence of [[neutron]]s, (which he had christened in his 1920 [[Bakerian Lecture]]), which could somehow compensate for the repelling effect of the positive charges of [[proton]]s by causing an attractive [[nuclear force]] and thus keep the nuclei from flying apart from the repulsion between protons</span>
				<span class='text'>The only alternative to neutrons was the existence of &quot;nuclear electrons&quot; which would counteract some of the proton charges in the nucleus, since by then it was known that nuclei had about twice the mass that could be accounted for if they were simply assembled from hydrogen nuclei (protons)</span>
				<span class='text'>But how these nuclear electrons could be trapped in the nucleus, was a mystery</span>
				<span class='text'>utherford's theory of [[neutron]]s was proved in 1932 by his associate [[James Chadwick]], who recognized neutrons immediately when they were produced by other scientists and later himself, in bombarding beryllium with alpha particles</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1935, Chadwick was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for this discovery</span>
				<span class='text'>=Legacy==[[File:Rutherford Plaque Manchester</span>
				<span class='text'>PG|thumbnail|right|A plaque commemorating Rutherford's presence at the [[University of Manchester|Victoria University]], Manchester]]===Nuclear physics===Rutherford's research, and work done under him as laboratory director, established the nuclear structure of the atom and the essential nature of radioactive decay as a nuclear process</span>
				<span class='text'>Rutherford's team, using natural alpha particles, demonstrated ''induced'' [[nuclear transmutation]], and later, using protons from an accelerator, demonstrated ''artificially-induced'' nuclear reactions and transmutation</span>
				<span class='text'>He is known as the father of nuclear physics</span>
				<span class='text'>Rutherford died too early to see [[Leó Szilárd]]'s idea of controlled [[nuclear chain reaction]]s come into being</span>
				<span class='text'>However, a speech of Rutherford's about his artificially-induced transmutation in lithium, printed in 12 September 1933 London paper ''[[The Times]]'', was reported by Szilárd to have been his inspiration for thinking of the possibility of a controlled energy-producing [[nuclear chain reaction]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Szilard had this idea while walking in London, on the same day</span>
				<span class='text'>utherford's speech touched on the 1932 work of his students [[John Cockcroft]] and [[Ernest Walton]] in &quot;splitting&quot; lithium into alpha particles by bombardment with protons from a particle accelerator they had constructed</span>
				<span class='text'>Rutherford realized that the energy released from the split lithium atoms was enormous, but he also realized that the energy needed for the accelerator, and its essential inefficiency in splitting atoms in this fashion, made the project an impossibility as a practical source of energy (accelerator-induced fission of light elements remains too inefficient to be used in this way, even today)</span>
				<span class='text'>Rutherford's speech in part, read:{{quote|We might in these processes obtain very much more energy than the proton supplied, but on the average we could not expect to obtain energy in this way</span>
				<span class='text'>It was a very poor and inefficient way of producing energy, and anyone who looked for a source of power in the transformation of the atoms was talking moonshine</span>
				<span class='text'>But the subject was scientifically interesting because it gave insight into the atoms</span>
