				<span class='text'>His birth name was '''Lotario dei Conti di Segni''', sometimes anglicised to Lothar of [[Conti di Segni|Segni]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ope Innocent was one of the most powerful and influential popes</span>
				<span class='text'>He exerted a wide influence over the Christian regimes of Europe, claiming supremacy over all of Europe's kings</span>
				<span class='text'>Pope Innocent was central in supporting the [[Catholic Church]]'s reforms of ecclesiastical affairs through his [[decretals]] and the [[Fourth Lateran Council]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This resulted in a considerable refinement of Western [[canon law]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Pope Innocent is notable for using [[interdict]] and other censures to compel princes to obey his decisions, although these measures were not uniformly successful</span>
				<span class='text'>Innocent called for Christian [[crusades]] against [[Muslim Spain]] and the [[Holy Land]], as well as the [[Albigensian Crusade]] against the [[Cathar]]s in southern France</span>
				<span class='text'>ne of Pope Innocent's most critical decisions was organizing the [[Fourth Crusade]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Originally intended to attack Jerusalem through Egypt, a series of unforeseen circumstances led the crusaders to Constantinople, where they ultimately attacked and sacked the city (1204)</span>
				<span class='text'> Innocent reluctantly accepted this result, seeing it as the will of God to reunite the Latin and [[Orthodox Church]]es, but it poisoned relations between the two churches</span>

				<span class='text'>Before his death he had urged the [[College of Cardinals]] to elect [[Giovanni di San Paolo]] as his successor, but Lotario de' Conti was elected pope in the ruins of the ancient [[Septizodium]], near the [[Circus Maximus]] in Rome after only two ballots on the very day on which Celestine III died</span>
				<span class='text'>He was only thirty-seven years old at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;newadvent1&quot;/&gt; He accepted the tiara with reluctance</span>
				<span class='text'>He took the name Innocent III, maybe as a reference to his predecessor [[Innocent II]] (1130-1143), who had succeeded in asserting the Papacy's authority over the emperor (in contrast with [[Celestine III]]'s recent policy)</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Reassertion of Papal power===As pope, Innocent III began with a very wide sense of his responsibility and of his authority</span>
				<span class='text'>The Muslim recapture of [[Jerusalem]] in 1187 was to him a divine judgment on the moral lapses of Christian princes</span>
				<span class='text'>He was also determined to protect what he called &quot;the liberty of the Church&quot; from inroads by [[secularity|secular]] princes</span>
				<span class='text'>This determination meant, among other things, that princes should not be involved in the selection of [[bishop]]s, and it was focused especially on the &quot;[[Patrimonium Sancti Petri|patrimonium]]&quot; of the papacy, the section of central Italy claimed by the popes and later called the [[Papal States]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The patrimonium was routinely threatened by [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] German kings who, as Roman emperors, claimed it for themselves</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]] expected to be succeeded by his infant son [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick]] as king of [[Sicily]], king of the Germans, and Roman Emperor, a combination that would have brought Germany, Italy, and Sicily under a single ruler and left the patrimonium exceedingly vulnerable</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;newadvent1&quot;/&gt;The early death of Henry VI left his 4-year-old son Frederick II as king</span>
				<span class='text'>Henry VI’s widow [[Constance of Sicily]] ruled over Sicily for her young son before he reached the age of majority</span>
				<span class='text'>She was as eager to remove German power from the kingdom of Sicily as was Innocent III</span>
				<span class='text'>Before her death in 1198, she named Innocent as guardian of the young Frederick until he reached his maturity</span>
				<span class='text'>In exchange, Innocent was also able to recover papal rights in Sicily that had been surrendered decades earlier to King [[William I of Sicily]] by [[Pope Adrian IV]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Pope invested the young Frederick II as King of Sicily in November 1198</span>
				<span class='text'>He also later induced Frederick II to marry the widow of King [[Emeric of Hungary]] in 1209</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;newadvent1&quot;/&gt;In 1209, [[Francis of Assisi]] led his first eleven followers to Rome to seek permission from Pope Innocent III to found a new religious Order, which was ultimately granted</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;chest107&quot;&gt;Chesterton (1924), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;107–108&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entry to Rome, the brothers encountered Bishop Guido of Assisi, who had in his company [[Giovanni di San Paolo]], the [[Cardinal Bishop of Sabina]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Cardinal, who was the confessor of Pope Innocent III, was immediately sympathetic to Francis and agreed to represent Francis to the pope</span>
				<span class='text'>Reluctantly, Pope Innocent agreed to meet with Francis and the brothers the next day</span>
				<span class='text'>After several days, the pope agreed to admit the group informally, adding that when God increased the group in grace and number, they could return for an official admittance</span>
				<span class='text'>The group was [[tonsure]]d</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Francis of Assisi and His World&quot;&gt;Galli(2002), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;74–80&lt;/ref&gt; This was important in part because it recognized Church authority and prevented his following from possible accusations of heresy, as had happened to the [[Waldensians]] decades earlier</span>
				<span class='text'>Though Pope Innocent initially had his doubts, following a dream in which he saw Francis holding up the [[Basilica of St</span>
				<span class='text'>John Lateran]] (the [[cathedral]] of Rome, thus the 'home church' of all Christendom), he decided to endorse Francis' Order</span>
				<span class='text'>This occurred, according to tradition, on April 16, 1210, and constituted the official founding of the [[Franciscan Order]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The group, then the &quot;Lesser Brothers&quot; (''Order of Friars Minor'' also known as the ''Franciscan Order''), preached on the streets and had no possessions</span>
				<span class='text'>They were centered in Porziuncola, and preached first in Umbria, before expanding throughout Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>==Involvement in Imperial elections===Papal power was based on more than scriptures</span>
				<span class='text'>The popes acquired large amounts of land, and bishops and clergy were, in theory, agents of papal programs</span>
				<span class='text'>Pope Innocent III’s increased involvement in Imperial elections took historically documented form when he called the [[Fourth Lateran Council]] in 1215 during which time he beckoned about 1200 bishops, [[abbot]]s and nobles from around Europe to assist in either tweaking current laws or creating new ones to further influence the masses in supporting the Pope as the universal authority of the Empire</span>
				<span class='text'>n order to define fundamental doctrines, the council reviewed the nature of the [[Eucharist]], the ordered annual confession of sins, and prescribed detailed procedures for the election of bishops</span>
				<span class='text'>The council also mandated a strict lifestyle for clergy, banning their participation in judicial procedures involving extremely painful punishments by which the accused would either [[Atonement in Christianity|atone]] for their sins or prove themselves innocent of often frivolous charges</span>
				<span class='text'>One doctrine that confirmed the “power over the spirit” theory was the implementation by the council mandating that Jews wear special identifying markings on their clothing&amp;nbsp;– a sign of the increased hostility felt by Christians towards Jews in the region</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Civilization in the West,” Kishlansky, Geary, O’Brien, Volume A to 1500, Seventh Edition, page 277&lt;/ref&gt;Another tool Innocent III used to attempt to gain universal authority and have more involvement in Imperial elections was letters he wrote to power brokers in the region</span>
				<span class='text'>The most explicit one concerns the [[theory of the sun and the moon]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ther letters that Innocent III sent during this attempt to mandate and secure the papal proprietor as the universal authority by demeaning and attempting to minimize the authority of the emperors were written under the title “Papal Policies”:* &quot;On Heresy: Letter to the Archbishop of Auch, 1198* &quot;On Usury: Letter to the French bishops, 1198* &quot;On Church Independence/Tithes: Letter to a bishop, 1198* &quot;On the crusade and Trade with Saracens:  Letter to the Venetians, 1198* &quot;On Jews: Decree of 1199”&lt;ref name=&quot;MS&quot;&gt;[http://legacy</span>
				<span class='text'>ordham</span>
				<span class='text'>du/halsall/source/innIII-policies</span>
				<span class='text'>sp Medieval Sourcebook: Innocent III: Letters on Papal Polices]</span>
				<span class='text'>Fordham</span>
				<span class='text'>du&lt;/ref&gt;One of the most direct public notices of the universal authority of the pope came in Innocent III’s “Papal Decree on the choice of a German King, 1201&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>It was his opportunity to force the acceptance of his decree amidst a chaotic election of three men for emperor:&lt;blockquote&gt;It is the business of the pope to look after the interests of the Roman empire, since the empire derives its origin and its final authority from the papacy; its origin, because it was originally transferred from Greece by and for the sake of the papacy</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>ts final authority, because the emperor is raised to his position by the pope who blesses him, crowns him and invests him with the empire</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Therefore, since three persons have lately been elected king by different parties, namely the youth [Frederick, son of Henry VI], Philip [of Hohenstaufen, brother of Henry VI], and Otto [of Brunswick, of the Welf family], so also three things must be taken into account in regard to each one, namely: the legality, the suitability and the expediency of his election</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Far be it from us that we should defer to man rather than to God, or that we should fear the countenance of the powerful</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>On the foregoing grounds, then, we decide that the youth should not at present be given the empire; we utterly reject Philip for his manifest unfitness and we order his usurpation to be resisted by all</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>since Otto is not only himself devoted to the church, but comes from devout ancestors on both sides</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>herefore we decree that he ought to be accepted and supported as king, and ought to be given the crown of empire, after the rights of the Roman church have been secured</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;MS&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;===Feudal power over Europe===During the reign of Pope Innocent III, the papacy was at the height of its powers</span>
				<span class='text'>He was considered to be the most powerful person in Europe at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;“Civilization in the West,” Kishlansky, Geary, O’Brien, Volume A to 1500, Seventh Edition, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>278&lt;/ref&gt; His papacy asserted the absolute spiritual authority of his office, while still respecting the temporal authority of kings</span>
				<span class='text'>fter the death of [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry VI]], who had recently also conquered the [[Kingdom of Sicily]], the succession became disputed: as Henry's son [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick]] was still a small child, the partisans of the [[Hohenstaufen|Staufen]] dynasty elected Henry’s brother, [[Philip, Duke of Swabia]], king in March 1198, whereas the princes opposed to the Staufen dynasty elected [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto, Duke of Brunswick]], of the [[House of Welf]]</span>
				<span class='text'>King [[Philip II of France]] supported Philip's claim, whereas [[Richard Lionheart|King Richard of England]] supported his nephew Otto</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Comyn, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>275&quot;&gt;Comyn, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>275&lt;/ref&gt;Pope Innocent was determined to prevent the continued unification of [[Sicily]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] under one monarch&lt;ref&gt;Schulman, Jana, ''The rise of the medieval world, 500–1300'', Greenwood, 2002, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>329&lt;/ref&gt; and seized the opportunity to extend his influence</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1201, the pope openly espoused the side of Otto IV, whose family had always been opposed to the house of [[Hohenstaufen]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bryce, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>206&quot;&gt;Bryce, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>206&lt;/ref&gt; Otto himself also seemed willing to grant any demands that Innocent would make</span>
				<span class='text'>The confusion in the Empire allowed Innocent to drive out the imperial feudal lords from [[Ancona]], [[Spoleto]] and [[Perugia]], who had been installed by Emperor Henry VI</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Comyn, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>277&quot;&gt;Comyn, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>277&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 July 1201, the papal legate, [[Cardinal-Bishop]] Guido of Palestrina announced to the people, in the cathedral of Cologne, that Otto IV had been approved by the pope as Roman king and threatened with [[excommunication]] all those who refused to acknowledge him</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time, Innocent encouraged the cities in [[March of Tuscany|Tuscany]] to form a league, called the [[League of San Genesio]] against German imperial interests in Italy, and they placed themselves under Innocent’s protection</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Comyn, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>277&quot;/&gt;In May 1202, Innocent issued the decree &quot;Venerabilem&quot;, addressed to the [[Duke of Zähringen]], in which he explained the relation he considered the Empire to stand to the papacy</span>
				<span class='text'>This decree, which has become famous, was afterwards embodied in the &quot;[[Corpus Juris Canonici]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www</span>
				<span class='text'>ewadvent</span>
				<span class='text'>rg |title=Home |publisher=New Advent |date= |accessdate=2010-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  contained the following major items:[[Image:Joao sem terra assina carta Magna</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|''John of England signs [[Magna Carta]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Illustration from ''Cassell's History of England'' (1902)]]* The German princes have the right to elect the king, who is afterwards to become emperor</span>
				<span class='text'>This right was given them by the [[Apostolic See]] when it transferred the imperial dignity from the Greeks to the Germans in the person of [[Charlemagne]]</span>
				<span class='text'> The right to investigate and decide whether a king thus elected is worthy of the imperial dignity belongs to the pope, whose office it is to anoint, consecrate, and crown him; otherwise it might happen that the pope would be obliged to [[anointing|anoint]], [[consecration|consecrate]], and Crown a king who was excommunicated, a [[heresy|heretic]], or a [[paganism|pagan]]</span>
				<span class='text'> If the pope finds that the king who has been elected by the princes is unworthy of the imperial dignity, the princes must elect a new king or, if they refuse, the pope will confer the imperial dignity upon another king; for the Church stands in need of a patron and defender</span>
				<span class='text'> In case of a double election the pope must exhort the princes to come to an agreement</span>
				<span class='text'>If after a due interval they have not reached an agreement they must ask the pope to arbitrate, failing which, he must of his own accord and by virtue of his office decide in favour of one of the claimants</span>
				<span class='text'>The pope's decision need not be based on the greater or less legality of either election, but on the qualifications of the claimants</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;newadvent1&quot;/&gt;Despite papal support, Otto could not oust his rival Philip until the latter was murdered in a private feud</span>
				<span class='text'>His rule now undisputed, Otto reneged on his earlier promises and now set his sights on reestablishing Imperial power in Italy and claiming even the Kingdom of Sicily</span>
				<span class='text'>Given the papal interest to keep Germany and Sicily apart, Innocent now supported his ward, King Frederick of Sicily, to resist Otto's advances and restore the Staufen dynasty to the Holy Roman Empire</span>
				<span class='text'>Frederick was duly elected by the Staufen partisans</span>
				<span class='text'>he conflict was decided by the [[Battle of Bouvines]] on 27 July 1214, which pitted Otto, allied to King [[John of England]] against Philip II Augustus</span>
				<span class='text'>Otto was defeated by the French and thereafter lost all influence</span>
				<span class='text'>He died on 19 May 1218, leaving Frederick II the undisputed emperor</span>

				<span class='text'>At the beginning of his [[pontiff|pontificate]], he focused on the [[Albigenses]], also known as the Cathars, a sect that had become widespread in southernwestern France, then under the control of local princes, such as the [[Count of Toulouse|Counts of Toulouse]]</span>
				<span class='text'> The Cathars rejected the authority and the teachings of the Catholic Church, and what they viewed in it as corrupt</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1199, Innocent III condemned the public preaching of heretical teachers</span>
				<span class='text'>Two [[Cistercians|Cistercian monks]] were sent to dispute the teachings of the Cathars and to reassert papal authority</span>
				<span class='text'>he murder of Pierre de Castelnau — Innocent's legate — in 1208, by unknown assailants commonly believed to be friends of Count Raymond of Toulouse (who was not a Cathar), caused Innocent to change his methods from words to weapons</span>
				<span class='text'>Innocent called upon King [[Philip II Augustus of France]] to suppress the Albigenses</span>
				<span class='text'>Under the leadership of [[Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester]], a campaign was launched</span>
				<span class='text'>The Albigensian Crusade, which led to the slaughter of approximately 20,000&lt;ref name=Cheney&gt;{{cite book|last=Cheney|first=Christopher R</span>

				<span class='text'>It was directed not only against heretical Christians, but also the nobility of [[Toulouse]] and vassals of the [[Crown of Aragon]]</span>
				<span class='text'>King [[Peter II of Aragon]] was directly involved in the conflict, and was killed in the course of the [[Battle of Muret]] in 1213</span>
				<span class='text'>The conflict largely ended with the [[Treaty of Paris (1229)|Treaty of Paris of 1229]], in which the integration of the Occitan territory in the French crown was agreed upon</span>
				<span class='text'>Military action ceased in 1255</span>
				<span class='text'>n parallel to the crusade the Catholic clergy launched a vilifying campaign against the heretics, associating them with abominable practices and sodomy as there was a concern that the populace of Provence and Northern Italy had started sympathizing with the Cathar victims of the crusade because of their moral purity</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Cheney&quot;/&gt;Innocent III’s first order of business in preaching the crusade was to send missionaries to every Catholic state to endorse the campaign</span>
				<span class='text'> Innocent III sent [[Peter of Capua]] to the kings France and England with specific instructions to convince them to settle their differences</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, in 1199, Innocent was successful in forging a truce of five years between the two nations</span>
				<span class='text'> The intent of the truce between the kings was not to allow them to lead the crusade, but rather to improve the likelihood that they would provide assistance</span>
				<span class='text'> For the army’s leadership, Innocent aimed his pleas at the knights and nobles of Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Cheney /&gt;  The pleadings were successful in France, where many lords answered the pope’s call, including the army’s two eventual leaders, Theobald of Champagne and [[Boniface I, Marquess of Montferrat|Boniface]], marquis of Montferrat</span>
				<span class='text'> Innocent III’s calls to action were not received with as much enthusiasm in England or Germany</span>
				<span class='text'> For this reason, the Fourth Crusade became mainly a French affair</span>

				<span class='text'>location=Milwauke}}&lt;/ref&gt;The Fourth Crusade was an expensive endeavor</span>
				<span class='text'> Innocent III chose to raise funds by doing something previously unheard of in popes</span>
				<span class='text'>He forced the entire clergy under his leadership to give one fortieth of their income in support of the Crusade</span>
				<span class='text'>This marked the first time a pope ever imposed a direct tax on his clerical subjects</span>
				<span class='text'> The pope faced many difficulties with collecting this tax, including corruption of his own officials and disregard of his subjects in England</span>
				<span class='text'>He continued in his attempt to garner funds for his crusade by sending envoys to [[John, King of England|King John]] of England and [[Philip II of France|King Philip]] of France</span>
				<span class='text'> Both men pledged to contribute one fortieth of their own salaries to the campaign</span>
				<span class='text'> John also declared that the tax would be collected throughout England as well</span>
				<span class='text'> The other source of funds for the crusade was the crusaders themselves</span>
				<span class='text'> Innocent declared that those who took the vow to become crusaders but could no longer perform the tasks that they had promised to complete, could be released of their oaths by a contribution of funds to the original cause</span>
				<span class='text'> The pope put Archbishop [[Hubert Walter]] in charge of collecting these dues</span>

				<span class='text'>Dent|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Innocent gave his approval of this agreement under two conditions: a representative of the pope must accompany the crusade, and the attack of any other Christians was strictly forbidden</span>
				<span class='text'>The French failed to raise sufficient funds for payment of the Venetians</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, the Crusaders diverted the crusade to the Christian city of [[Zadar|Zara]] at the will of the Venetians to subsidize the debt</span>
				<span class='text'>This diversion was adopted without the consent of Innocent III, who threatened excommunication to any who took part in the attack</span>
				<span class='text'>A majority of the French ignored the threat and attacked Zara, and were excommunicated by Innocent III, but soon were forgiven so as to continue the crusade</span>
				<span class='text'>A second diversion then occurred when the crusaders decided to conquer Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire</span>
				<span class='text'>This diversion was taken without any knowledge by Innocent III, and he did not learn of it until after the city had been captured</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elliott-Binns|first=Leonard|title=Innocent III|year=1931|publisher=Archon|location=Hamden, Conn}}&lt;/ref&gt;Innocent viewed the capture of Constantinople as a way to reunite the schismatic [[Roman Catholic Church|Western]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] Churches</span>
				<span class='text'>His goal was to install the Latin (Western) ideals into the main center of the Greek (Eastern) Church</span>
				<span class='text'>He saw the invasion as a way of making the Greek Church submit to the views of those that occupied their city</span>
				<span class='text'>His tactics ultimately failed due to the significant differences between the two churches</span>
