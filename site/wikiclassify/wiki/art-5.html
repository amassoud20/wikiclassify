				<span class='text'>It was during his time in Italy that he wrote a short essay with the title On the Investigation of the State of the  in a Magnetic Field</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1895 at the age of 16 Einstein sat the entrance examinations for the  in  later the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule ETH</span>
				<span class='text'>He failed to reach the required standard in the general part of the examination but obtained exceptional grades in physics and mathematics</span>

				<span class='text'>There have been claims that Marić collaborated with Einstein on his celebrated 1905 papers   but historians of physics who have studied the issue find no evidence that she made any substantive contributions</span>

				<span class='text'>instein returned to the problem of thermodynamic fluctuations giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point</span>
				<span class='text'>Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density</span>

				<span class='text'> In 1917 at the height of his work on relativity Einstein published an article in Physikalische Zeitschrift that proposed the possibility of  the physical process that makes possible the  and the </span>
				<span class='text'>his article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with Plancks distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode</span>
				<span class='text'>This paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws</span>
				<span class='text'>instein discovered s work and supported his ideas which were received skeptically at first</span>
				<span class='text'>In another major paper from this era Einstein gave a wave equation for  which Einstein suggested was the  of mechanics</span>
				<span class='text'>This paper would inspire Schrödingers work of 1926</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1924 Einstein received a description of a  model from Indian physicist  based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of indistinguishable particles</span>
				<span class='text'>Einstein noted that Boses statistics applied to some atoms as well as to the proposed light particles and submitted his translation of Boses paper to the </span>
				<span class='text'>Einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications among them the  phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures</span>
				<span class='text'>It was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by  and  using  equipment built at the – laboratory at the </span>

				<span class='text'> allows these quantities to be determined from a  with  but  makes translation invariance into something of a </span>
				<span class='text'>The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noethers presecriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason</span>
				<span class='text'>instein argued that this is true for fundamental reasons because the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates</span>
				<span class='text'>He maintained that the non covariant energy momentum pseudotensor was in fact the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field</span>
				<span class='text'>This approach has been echoed by  and  and others and has become standard</span>
				<span class='text'>he use of non covariant objects like pseudotensors was heavily criticized in 1917 by  and others</span>
				<span class='text'>ollowing his research on general relativity Einstein entered into a series of attempts to generalize his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism as another aspect of a single entity</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1950 he described his  in a  article entitled On the Generalized Theory of Gravitation</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he continued to be lauded for his work Einstein became increasingly isolated in his research and his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful</span>
				<span class='text'>n his pursuit of a unification of the fundamental forces Einstein ignored some mainstream developments in physics most notably the  and s which were not well understood until many years after his death</span>
				<span class='text'>Mainstream physics in turn largely ignored Einsteins approaches to unification</span>
				<span class='text'>Einsteins dream of unifying other laws of physics with gravity motivates modern quests for a  and in particular  where geometrical fields emerge in a unified quantum mechanical setting</span>
				<span class='text'>instein collaborated with others to produce a model of a </span>
				<span class='text'>His motivation was to model elementary particles with charge as a solution of gravitational field equations in line with the program outlined in the paper Do Gravitational Fields play an Important Role in the Constitution of the Elementary Particles</span>
				<span class='text'>These solutions cut and pasted s to make a bridge between two patches</span>
				<span class='text'>f one end of a wormhole was positively charged the other end would be negatively charged</span>
				<span class='text'>These properties led Einstein to believe that pairs of particles and antiparticles could be described in this way</span>
				<span class='text'>n order to incorporate spinning point particles into general relativity the affine connection needed to be generalized to include an antisymmetric part called the </span>
				<span class='text'>This modification was made by Einstein and Cartan in the 1920s</span>
				<span class='text'>he theory of general relativity has a fundamental law—the  which describe how space curves the  which describes how particles move may be derived from the Einstein equations</span>
				<span class='text'>ince the equations of general relativity are non linear a lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields like a black hole would move on a trajectory which is determined by the Einstein equations themselves not by a new law</span>
				<span class='text'>So Einstein proposed that the path of a singular solution like a black hole would be determined to be a geodesic from general relativity itself</span>
				<span class='text'>his was established by Einstein Infeld and Hoffmann for pointlike objects without angular momentum and by  for spinning objects</span>
				<span class='text'>instein conducted other investigations that were unsuccessful and abandoned</span>
				<span class='text'>These pertain to    and other research</span>
				<span class='text'>n addition to longtime collaborators    and others Einstein also had some one shot collaborations with various scientists</span>
				<span class='text'>Einstein and De Haas demonstrated that magnetization is due to the motion of electrons nowadays known to be the spin</span>
				<span class='text'>In order to show this they reversed the magnetization in an iron bar suspended on a </span>
				<span class='text'>They confirmed that this leads the bar to rotate because the electrons angular momentum changes as the magnetization changes</span>
				<span class='text'>This experiment needed to be sensitive because the angular momentum associated with electrons is small but it definitively established that electron motion of some kind is responsible for magnetization</span>
				<span class='text'>Einstein suggested to Erwin Schrödinger that he might be able to reproduce the statistics of a  by considering a box</span>
				<span class='text'>Then to each possible quantum motion of a particle in a box associate an independent harmonic oscillator</span>
				<span class='text'>Quantizing these oscillators each level will have an integer occupation number which will be the number of particles in it</span>
				<span class='text'>his formulation is a form of  but it predates modern quantum mechanics</span>

				<span class='text'>He considered how a measurement on one of two entangled particles would affect the other</span>

				<span class='text'>The principle he proposed is that if it is possible to determine what the answer to a position or momentum measurement would be without in any way disturbing the particle then the particle actually has values of position or momentum</span>
