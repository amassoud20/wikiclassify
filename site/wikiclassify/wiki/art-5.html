				<span class='text'>This led to the development of his [[special theory of relativity]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He realized, however, that the principle of relativity could also be extended to [[gravitational fields]], and with his subsequent theory of gravitation in 1916, he published a paper on general relativity</span>
				<span class='text'>He continued to deal with problems of [[statistical mechanics]] and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of [[particle]] theory and the [[Brownian motion|motion of molecules]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also investigated the thermal properties of light which laid the foundation of the [[photon]] theory of light</span>

				<span class='text'>After [[Ernest Rutherford]] discovered the nucleus and proposed that electrons orbit like planets, Niels Bohr was able to show that the same quantum mechanical postulates introduced by Planck and developed by Einstein would explain the discrete motion of electrons in atoms, and the [[periodic table of the elements]]</span>
				<span class='text'>instein contributed to these developments by linking them with the 1898 arguments [[Wilhelm Wien]] had made</span>
				<span class='text'>Wien had shown that the hypothesis of [[adiabatic invariant|adiabatic invariance]] of a thermal equilibrium state allows all the [[blackbody radiation|blackbody curves]] at different temperature to be derived from one another by a [[Wien's displacement law|simple shifting process]]</span>

				<span class='text'>This paper introduced the ''photon'' concept (although the name ''photon'' was introduced later by [[Gilbert N</span>
				<span class='text'>Lewis]] in 1926) and inspired the notion of [[wave–particle duality]] in [[quantum mechanics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Einstein saw this wave-particle duality in radiation as concrete evidence for his conviction that physics needed a new, unified foundation</span>
				<span class='text'>== Theory of critical opalescence ==={{Main|Critical opalescence}}Einstein returned to the problem of thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point</span>
				<span class='text'>Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density</span>
				<span class='text'>At the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading to large fluctuations</span>
				<span class='text'>The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white</span>

				<span class='text'>According to [[general relativity]], the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of [[spacetime|space and time]] by those masses</span>
				<span class='text'>General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern [[astrophysics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It provides the foundation for the current understanding of [[black holes]], regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape</span>
				<span class='text'>s Albert Einstein later said, the reason for the development of general relativity was that the preference of inertial motions within [[special relativity]] was unsatisfactory, while a theory which from the outset prefers no state of motion (even accelerated ones) should appear more satisfactory</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfnp|Einstein|1923}} Consequently, in 1907 he published an article on acceleration under special relativity</span>
				<span class='text'>In that article titled &quot;On the Relativity Principle and the Conclusions Drawn from It&quot;, he argued that [[free fall]] is really inertial motion, and that for a free-falling observer the rules of special relativity must apply</span>
				<span class='text'>This argument is called the [[equivalence principle]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In the same article, Einstein also predicted the phenomena of [[gravitational time dilation]], [[gravitational red shift]] and [[Gravitational lensing|deflection of light]]</span>

				<span class='text'>{Sfnp|Einstein|1917b}}This article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with Planck's distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode</span>

				<span class='text'>instein discovered [[Louis de Broglie]]'s work, and supported his ideas, which were received skeptically at first</span>

				<span class='text'>[[Noether's theorem]] allows these quantities to be determined from a [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] with [[Translational symmetry|translation invariance]], but [[general covariance]] makes translation invariance into something of a [[gauge symmetry]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether's presecriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason</span>
				<span class='text'>instein argued that this is true for fundamental reasons, because the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates</span>
				<span class='text'>He maintained that the non-covariant energy momentum pseudotensor was in fact the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field</span>

				<span class='text'>n his pursuit of a unification of the fundamental forces, Einstein ignored some mainstream developments in physics, most notably the [[strong nuclear force|strong]] and [[weak nuclear force]]s, which were not well understood until many years after his death</span>
				<span class='text'>Mainstream physics, in turn, largely ignored Einstein's approaches to unification</span>

				<span class='text'>The principle he proposed is that if it is possible to determine what the answer to a position or momentum measurement would be, without in any way disturbing the particle, then the particle actually has values of position or momentum</span>
