				<span class='text'>The [[Fathers of Confederation|dominant figure]] of [[Canadian Confederation]], he had a political career which spanned almost half a century</span>
				<span class='text'> He drank heavily, and in 1873 was voted out during the [[Pacific Scandal]], in which his party took bribes from businessmen seeking the contract to build the Pacific Railway</span>
				<span class='text'> Macdonald's greatest achievements were building and guiding a successful national government for the new Dominion, using patronage to forge a strong Conservative Party, promoting the protective tariff of the [[National Policy]], and building the transcontinental Canadian Pacific Railway</span>
				<span class='text'>Economic growth was slow during his years in office, as Canada verged on stagnation; many residents migrated to the fast-growing United States</span>
				<span class='text'>He fought to block provincial efforts to take power back from Ottawa</span>
				<span class='text'> His most controversial move was to approve the execution of Métis leader [[Louis Riel]] for treason in 1885; it permanently alienated the Francophones who saw themselves humiliated</span>
				<span class='text'>Macdonald was born in Scotland; when he was a boy his family immigrated to [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]] in the colony of [[Upper Canada]] (today in eastern [[Ontario]])</span>
				<span class='text'>As a lawyer he was involved in several high-profile cases and quickly became prominent in Kingston, which elected him in 1844 to the legislature of the colonial [[Province of Canada|United Province of Canada]]</span>
				<span class='text'>By 1857 had become [[List of Joint Premiers of the Province of Canada|premier]] under the colony's unstable political system</span>
				<span class='text'>hen in 1864 no party proved capable of governing for long, Macdonald agreed to a proposal from his political rival, [[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]], that the parties unite in a [[Great Coalition]] to seek federation and political reform</span>
				<span class='text'>Macdonald was the leading figure in the subsequent discussions and conferences, which resulted in the [[British North America Act, 1867|British North America Act]] and the birth of Canada as a nation on 1 July 1867</span>
				<span class='text'>acdonald was the first Prime Minister of the new nation, and served  19&amp;nbsp;years; only [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] served longer</span>
				<span class='text'>= Early years, 1815–1830 ==John Alexander Macdonald was born in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]], on 11 January 1815</span>
				<span class='text'>{efn|name=born}} His father was Hugh Macdonald, an unsuccessful merchant, who had married John's mother, Helen Shaw, on 21 October 1811</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Phenix|2006|p=6}} John Alexander Macdonald was the third of five children</span>
				<span class='text'>After Hugh Macdonald's business ventures left him in debt, the family immigrated to [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], in [[Upper Canada]] (today the southern and eastern portions of Ontario), in 1820, where there were already a number of Macdonald relatives and connections</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Gwyn|2007|p=13}}The Macdonalds initially lived with another family, but then resided over a store which Hugh Macdonald ran</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon after their arrival, John's younger brother James died from a blow to the head by a servant who was supposed to look after the boys</span>
				<span class='text'>After Hugh's store failed, the family moved to Hay Bay (south of [[Napanee, Ontario]]), west of Kingston, where Hugh unsuccessfully ran another shop</span>
				<span class='text'>His father, in 1829, was appointed a magistrate for the [[Midland District, Upper Canada|Midland District]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Phenix|2006|p=23}} John Macdonald's mother was a lifelong influence on her son, helping him in his difficult first marriage and remaining a force in his life until her 1862 death</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Smith|McLeod|1989|p=1}}John initially attended local schools</span>
				<span class='text'>When he was aged 10, his family scraped together the money to send him to Midland District Grammar School in Kingston</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Smith|McLeod|1989|p=1}} Macdonald's formal schooling ended at 15, a common school-leaving age at a time when only children from the most prosperous families were able to attend university</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Creighton|1952|p=18}} Nevertheless, Macdonald later regretted leaving school when he did, remarking to his secretary [[Joseph Pope]] that if he had attended university, he might have embarked on a literary career</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Pope|1894|p=4}}== Law career, 1830–1843 ===== Legal training and early career, 1830–1837 ===Macdonald's parents decided he should become a lawyer after leaving school</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=19}} As [[Donald Creighton]] (who penned a two-volume biography of Macdonald in the 1950s) wrote, &quot;law was a broad, well-trodden path to comfort, influence, even to power&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Creighton|1952|p=19}} It was also &quot;the obvious choice for a boy who seemed as attracted to study as he was uninterested in trade</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Creighton|1952|p=19}} Besides, Macdonald needed to start earning money immediately to support his family because his father's businesses were again failing</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;I had no boyhood,&quot; he complained many years later</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;From the age of 15, I began to earn my own living</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Pope|1894|p=6}}[[File:Rideau-Street-house01</span>
				<span class='text'>if|thumb|A few months after he opened his first law office in 1835, Macdonald moved with his parents and sisters to this {{frac|2|1|2}}-storey stone house on Kingston's Rideau Street</span>
				<span class='text'>]Macdonald travelled by steamboat to Toronto (known until 1834 as [[York, Upper Canada|York]]), where he passed an examination set by [[The Law Society of Upper Canada]], including mathematics, Latin, and history</span>
				<span class='text'>British North America had no law schools in 1830; students were examined when beginning and ending their tutelage</span>
				<span class='text'>Between the two examinations, they were apprenticed, or articled to established lawyers</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Creighton|1952|pp=19–20}} Macdonald began his apprenticeship with George Mackenzie, a prominent young lawyer who was a well-regarded member of Kingston's rising Scottish community</span>
				<span class='text'>Mackenzie practised corporate law, a lucrative speciality that Macdonald himself would later pursue</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Gwyn|2007|pp=46–47}} Macdonald was a promising student, and in the summer of 1833, managed the Mackenzie office when his employer went on a business trip to Montreal and Quebec in [[Lower Canada]] (today the southern portion of the [[Quebec|province of Quebec]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Later that year, Macdonald was sent to manage the law office of a Mackenzie cousin who had fallen ill</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Creighton|1952|pp=29–30}}In August 1834, George Mackenzie died of [[cholera]]</span>
				<span class='text'>With his supervising lawyer dead, Macdonald remained at the cousin's law office in Hallowell (today [[Picton, Ontario]])</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1835, Macdonald returned to Kingston, and even though not yet of age nor qualified, began his practice as a lawyer, hoping to gain his former employer's clients</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Creighton|1952|pp=32–34}} Macdonald's parents and sisters also returned to Kingston, and Hugh Macdonald became a bank clerk</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Phenix|2006|p=38}}Soon after Macdonald was [[call to the bar|called to the Bar]] in February 1836, he arranged to take in two students; both became, like Macdonald, [[Fathers of Confederation]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Oliver Mowat]] became premier of Ontario, and [[Alexander Campbell (Canadian senator)|Alexander Campbell]] a federal cabinet minister and [[Lieutenant Governor of Ontario]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=19}} One early client was Eliza Grimason, an Irish immigrant then aged sixteen, who sought advice concerning a shop she and her husband wanted to buy</span>
				<span class='text'>Grimason would become one of Macdonald's richest and most loyal supporters, and may have also become his lover</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Phenix|2006|p=41}} Macdonald joined many local organisations, seeking to become well known in the town</span>
				<span class='text'>He also sought out high-profile cases, representing accused child rapist William Brass</span>
				<span class='text'>Brass was hanged for his crime, but Macdonald attracted positive press comments for the quality of his defence</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Phenix|2006|pp=41–42}} According to his biographer, [[Richard Gwyn]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;As a criminal lawyer who took on dramatic cases, Macdonald got himself noticed well beyond the narrow confines of the Kingston business community</span>
				<span class='text'>He was operating now in the arena where he would spend by far the greatest part of his life&amp;nbsp;– the court of public opinion</span>
				<span class='text'>And, while there, he was learning the arts of argument and of persuasion that would serve him all his political life</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Gwyn|2007|p=49}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;=== Legal prominence, 1837–43 ===All male Upper Canadians between 18 and 60&amp;nbsp;years of age were members of the Sedentary Militia, which was called into active duty during the [[Rebellions of 1837]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Macdonald served as a private in the militia, patrolling the area around Kingston, but the town saw no real action and Macdonald was not called upon to fire on the enemy</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Phenix|2006|p=43}}Although most of the trials resulting from the [[Upper Canada Rebellion]] took place in Toronto, Macdonald represented one of the defendants in the one trial to take place in Kingston</span>
				<span class='text'>All the Kingston defendants were acquitted, and a local paper described Macdonald as &quot;one of the youngest barristers in the Province &lt;nowiki&gt;[who]&lt;/nowiki&gt; is rapidly rising in his profession&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Creighton|1952|pp=53–54}}[[File:Battle of the Windmill</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|left|thumb|Battle of the Windmill, near Prescott, Upper Canada, 13 November 1838]]In late 1838, Macdonald agreed to advise one of a group of American raiders who had crossed the border to liberate Canada from what they saw as the yoke of British colonial oppression</span>
				<span class='text'>The inept invaders had been captured after the [[Battle of the Windmill]] (near [[Prescott, Ontario]]), in which 16 Canadians were killed and 60 wounded</span>
				<span class='text'>Public opinion was inflamed against the prisoners, as they were accused of mutilating the body of a dead Canadian lieutenant</span>
				<span class='text'>Macdonald biographer Donald Creighton wrote that Kingston was &quot;mad with grief and rage and horror&quot; at the allegations</span>
				<span class='text'>Macdonald could not represent the prisoners, as they were tried by [[court-martial]] and civilian counsel had no standing</span>
				<span class='text'>At the request of Kingston relatives of Daniel George, paymaster of the ill-fated invasion, Macdonald agreed to advise George, who, like the other prisoners, had to conduct his own defence</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Creighton|1952|pp=61–63}} George was convicted and hanged</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Creighton|1952|p=67}} According to Macdonald biographer Donald Swainson, &quot;By 1838, Macdonald's position was secure</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a public figure, a popular young man, and a senior lawyer</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=21}}The [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] merged Upper and Lower Canada into the [[Province of Canada]] effective in 1841</span>
				<span class='text'>Kingston became the initial capital of the new province; Upper Canada and Lower Canada became known as Canada West and Canada East</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=22}}Macdonald continued to expand his practice while being appointed director of many companies, mainly in Kingston</span>
				<span class='text'>Macdonald became both a director of and a lawyer for the new Commercial Bank of the Midland District</span>
				<span class='text'>Throughout the 1840s, Macdonald invested heavily in real estate, including commercial properties in downtown Toronto</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Gwyn|2007|p=58}} Meanwhile, he was suffering from some illness, and in 1841, his father died</span>
				<span class='text'>Sick and grieving, he decided to take a lengthy holiday in Britain in early 1842</span>
				<span class='text'>He left for the journey well supplied with money, as he spent the last three days before his departure gambling at the card game [[loo (card game)|loo]] and winning substantially</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=23}} Sometime during his two months in Britain, he met his first cousin, [[Isabella Macdonald|Isabella Clark]]</span>
				<span class='text'>As Macdonald did not mention her in his letters home, the circumstances of their meeting are not known</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Phenix|2006|p=56}} In late 1842, Isabella journeyed to Kingston to visit with a sister</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Phenix|2006|p=57}} The visit stretched for nearly a year before John and Isabella Macdonald married on 1 September 1843</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Phenix|2006|p=59}}== Political rise, 1843–64 ===== Parliamentary advancement, 1843–57 ===[[File:Isabella Clark Macdonald</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Portrait of Isabella Clark Macdonald, artist unknown</span>
				<span class='text'>]In February 1843, Macdonald announced his candidacy for the post of [[alderman]] in Kingston's Fourth Ward</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Gwyn|2007|p=59}} On 29 March 1843, Macdonald celebrated his first election victory, with 156 votes against 43 for his opponent, a Colonel Jackson</span>
				<span class='text'>He also suffered what he termed his first downfall, as his supporters, carrying the victorious candidate, accidentally dropped him onto a slushy street</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Phenix|2006|p=59}}In March 1844, Macdonald was asked by local businessmen to stand as Conservative candidate for Kingston in [[List of elections in the Province of Canada#1844|the upcoming legislative election]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Phenix|2006|pp=63–64}} Macdonald followed the contemporary custom of supplying the voters with large quantities of alcohol</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=25}} In the era preceding the [[secret ballot]] when votes were publicly declared, Macdonald defeated his opponent, Anthony Manahan, by 275&amp;nbsp;&quot;shouts&quot; to 42 when the two-day election concluded on 15 October 1844</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Gwyn|2007|p=64}} At that time, the Legislative Assembly met in Montreal</span>
				<span class='text'>Macdonald was never an orator, and especially disliked the bombastic addresses of the time</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, he found a niche in becoming an expert on election law and parliamentary procedure</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=28}}In 1844, Isabella fell ill</span>
				<span class='text'>She recovered, but the illness recurred the following year, and she became an invalid</span>
				<span class='text'>John Macdonald took his wife to [[Savannah, Georgia]], in the United States in 1845, hoping that the sea air and warmth would cure her ailments</span>
				<span class='text'>Although John Macdonald was able to return to Canada after six months, Isabella remained in the United States for three years</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=28–29}} He visited her again in New York at the end of 1846, and returned several months later when she informed him she was pregnant</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Phenix|2006|pp=79–83}} In August 1847 their son John Alexander Macdonald Jr</span>
				<span class='text'>was born in New York, but as Isabella remained ill, relatives cared for the infant</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=30–31}}Although he was often absent due to his wife's illness, Macdonald was able to gain professional and political advancement</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1846, he was made a [[Queen's Counsel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The same year, he was offered the non-cabinet post of [[Solicitor General of Canada|Solicitor General]], but declined it</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1847, the [[Joint Premiers of the Province of Canada|Joint Premier]], [[William Henry Draper]], appointed Macdonald as Receiver General</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=31}} Accepting the government post required Macdonald to give up his law firm income{{sfn|Phenix|2006|p=83}} and spend most of his time in Montreal, away from Isabella</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=31}} When elections were held in December 1848 and January 1848, Macdonald was easily reelected for Kingston, but the Conservatives lost seats and were forced to resign when the legislature reconvened in March 1848</span>
				<span class='text'>Macdonald returned to Kingston when the legislature was not sitting, and Isabella joined him there in June</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=31}} In August, the child John Jr</span>
				<span class='text'>died suddenly</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Gwyn|2007|pp=85–86}} In March 1850, Isabella Macdonald gave birth to another boy, [[Hugh John Macdonald]], and his father wrote, &quot;We have got Johnny back again, almost his image</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=37}} Macdonald began to drink heavily around this time, both in public and in private, which Patricia Phenix, who studied Macdonald's private life, attributes to his family troubles</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Phenix|2006|p=107}}The Liberals, or [[Clear Grits|Grits]], maintained power in the 1851 election, but soon, they were divided by a parliamentary scandal</span>
				<span class='text'>In September, the government resigned, and a [[coalition]] government uniting parties from both parts of the province under Sir [[Allan MacNab]] took power</span>
				<span class='text'>Macdonald did much of the work of putting the government together and served as [[Attorney General]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The coalition which came to power in 1854 became known as the [[Liberal-Conservative Party|Liberal-Conservatives]] (referred to, for short, as the Conservatives)</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1855, [[George-Étienne Cartier]] of Canada East (today Quebec) joined the Cabinet</span>
				<span class='text'>Until Cartier's 1873 death, he would be Macdonald's political partner</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1856, MacNab was eased out as premier by Macdonald, who became the leader of the Canada West Conservatives</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=40–42}} Though the most powerful man in the government he remained as Attorney General, with Sir [[Étienne-Paschal Taché]] as premier</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Gwyn|2007|p=162}}=== Colonial leader, 1838–64 ===[[File:John A Macdonald in 1858</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|John A</span>
				<span class='text'>Macdonald in 1858]]In July 1857, Macdonald departed for Britain to promote Canadian government projects</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Phenix|2006|pp=124–125}} On his return to Canada, he was appointed premier in place of the retiring Taché, just in time to lead the Conservatives in a general election</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=42}} Macdonald was elected in Kingston by 1,189&amp;nbsp;votes to 9 for John Shaw, who was subsequently hanged in effigy; however, other Conservatives did badly in Canada West, and only French-Canadian support kept Macdonald in power</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Phenix|2006|p=129}} On 28 December, Isabella Macdonald died, leaving John A</span>
				<span class='text'>Macdonald a widower with a seven-year-old son</span>
				<span class='text'>Hugh John Macdonald would be principally raised by his paternal aunt and her husband</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Phenix|2006|p=130}}In 1838, the Assembly had voted to move the seat of government permanently to Quebec City</span>
				<span class='text'>Macdonald had opposed that, and used his power to force the Assembly to reconsider in 1857</span>
				<span class='text'>Macdonald proposed that [[Queen Victoria]] decide which city should be Canada's capital</span>
				<span class='text'>Opponents, especially from Canada East, argued that the Queen would not make the decision in isolation; she would be bound to receive informal advice from her Canadian ministers</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, Macdonald's scheme was adopted, with Canada East support assured by allowing Quebec City to serve a three-year term as the seat of government before the Assembly moved to the permanent capital</span>
				<span class='text'>Macdonald privately asked the [[Colonial Office]] to ensure that the Queen would not respond for at least 10 months, or until after the general election</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Creighton|1952|pp=248–249}} In February 1858, the Queen's choice was announced, much to the dismay of many legislators from both parts of the province: the isolated Canada West town of [[Ottawa]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=46–47}}On 28 July 1838, an opposition Canada East member proposed an address to the Queen informing her that Ottawa was an unsuitable place for a national capital</span>
				<span class='text'>Macdonald's Canada East party members [[crossing the floor|crossed the floor]] to vote for the address, and the government was defeated</span>
				<span class='text'>Macdonald resigned, and the Governor General, [[Sir Edmund Walker Head, 8th Baronet|Sir Edmund Walker Head]], invited opposition leader [[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]] to form a government</span>
				<span class='text'>Under the law at that time, Brown and his ministers lost their seats in the Assembly by accepting office, and had to face [[by-election]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>This gave Macdonald a majority pending the by-elections, and he promptly defeated the government</span>
				<span class='text'>Head refused Brown's request for a dissolution of the Assembly, and Brown and his ministers resigned</span>
				<span class='text'>Head then asked Macdonald to form a government</span>
				<span class='text'>The law allowed anyone who had held a ministerial position within the last thirty days to accept a new position without needing to face a by-election; Macdonald and his ministers accepted new positions, then completed what was dubbed the &quot;Double Shuffle&quot; by returning to their old posts</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Gwyn|2007|pp=175–177}} In an effort to give the appearance of fairness, Head insisted that Cartier be titular premier, with Macdonald as his deputy</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=48}}In the late 1850s and early 1860s, Canada enjoyed a period of great prosperity</span>
				<span class='text'>The railroad and telegraph improved communications</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Macdonald biographer Richard Gwyn, &quot;In short, Canadians began to become a single community</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Gwyn|2007|pp=194–195}} At the same time, the provincial government became increasingly difficult to manage</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=111}} These picnics allowed Macdonald venues to show off his talents at campaigning, and were often lighthearted—at one, the Tory leader blamed agricultural pests on the Grits, and promised the insects would go away if the Conservatives were elected</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=111–112}}The final days of the [[3rd Canadian Parliament]] were marked by explosive conflict, as Macdonald and Tupper alleged that MP and railway financier [[Donald Smith, 1st Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal|Donald Smith]] had been allowed to build the [[Pembina, North Dakota|Pembina]] branch of the CPR (connecting to American lines) as a reward for betraying the Conservatives during the Pacific Scandal</span>
				<span class='text'>The altercation continued even after the Commons had been summoned to the Senate to hear the dissolution read, as Macdonald spoke the final words recorded in the 3rd Parliament: &quot;That fellow Smith is the biggest liar I ever saw!&quot;{{sfn|Creighton|1955|pp=239–240}}[[Canadian federal election, 1878|The election]] was called for 17 September 1878</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1880, Macdonald found a syndicate, led by [[George Stephen, 1st Baron Mount Stephen|George Stephen]], willing to undertake the CPR project</span>
				<span class='text'>Donald Smith (later Lord Strathcona) was a major partner in the syndicate, but because of the ill will between him and the Conservatives, Smith's participation was initially not made public, though it was well-known to Macdonald</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=118–119}} When Canadian guarantees of the CPR's bonds failed to make them salable in a declining economy, Macdonald obtained a loan to the corporation from the Treasury—the bill authorizing it passed the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]] just before the firm would have become insolvent</span>

				<span class='text'>The hanging of Riel proved bitterly controversial,{{sfn|Waite|1975|pp=159–162}} and alienated many Quebecers (like Riel, Catholic and culturally [[French Canadian]]) from the Conservatives—they soon realign themselves with the Liberals</span>

				<span class='text'>Macdonald sought to pass a Fisheries Act which would override some of the treaty provisions, to the dismay of the British, who were still responsible for external relations</span>
				<span class='text'>The British government instructed the Governor General, [[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne|Lord Lansdowne]], to reserve [[Royal Assent]] for the bill, effectively placing it on hold without vetoing it</span>

				<span class='text'>The provincial election was seen as a bellwether for the federal poll</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite considerable campaigning by the Prime Minister, Mowat's Liberals were returned in Ontario, and increased their majority</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Creighton|1955|pp=454–456}} Macdonald finally dissolved Parliament on 15 January 1887 for [[Canadian federal election, 1887|an election]] on 22 February</span>
				<span class='text'>During the campaign, Macdonald suffered another blow when the Quebec provincial Liberals were able to form a government (four months after [[Quebec general election, 1886|the October 1886 Quebec election]]), forcing the Conservatives from power in Quebec City</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, Macdonald and his cabinet campaigned hard in the winter election, with Tupper (the new [[High Commissioner]] to London) postponing his departure to try to bolster Conservative hopes in Nova Scotia</span>
				<span class='text'>The Liberal leader, [[Edward Blake]], ran an uninspiring campaign, and the Conservatives were returned nationally with a majority of 35, winning easily in Ontario, Nova Scotia and Manitoba</span>

				<span class='text'>Under Laurier's early leadership, the Liberals, who had accepted much of the National Policy under Blake while questioning details, rejected it entirely, calling for &quot;unrestricted reciprocity&quot;, or free trade, with the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>Advocates of Laurier's plan argued that north–south trade made more economic sense than trying to trade across the vast, empty prairies, using a CPR which was already provoking resentment for what were seen as high freight rates</span>
