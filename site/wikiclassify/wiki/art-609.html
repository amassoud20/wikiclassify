				<span class='text'>}&lt;!--Basic introduction; who he is, when he lived, why he was significant--&gt;'''Fidel Alejandro Castro Ruz''' ({{IPA-es|fiˈðel aleˈxandɾo ˈkastɾo ˈrus|am}} {{Audio|Es-Fidel Castro</span>
				<span class='text'>gg|audio}}; born August 13, 1926), commonly known as '''Fidel Castro''', is a [[Cubans|Cuban]] [[politics|politician]] and [[revolutionary]] who served as [[Prime Minister of Cuba|Prime Minister]] of the [[Cuba|Republic of Cuba]] from 1959 to 1976 and then [[President of Cuba|President]] from 1976 to 2008</span>
				<span class='text'>Politically a [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] and [[nationalism|Cuban nationalist]], he also served as the [[First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba|First Secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of Cuba]] from 1961 until 2011</span>
				<span class='text'>Under his administration Cuba became a [[one-party state|one-party]] [[socialist state]]; industry and business were [[Nationalization|nationalized]], and [[state socialism|state socialist]] reforms were implemented throughout society</span>
				<span class='text'>Internationally, Castro was the Secretary-General of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] from 1979 to 1983 and from 2006 to 2008</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;!--Early life, revolutionary activism, and the establishment of the Castro regime--&gt; Born in [[Birán]] as the son of a wealthy farmer, Castro adopted [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] politics while studying law at the [[University of Havana]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After participating in rebellions against [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] governments in the Dominican Republic and Colombia, he planned the overthrow of Cuban President [[Fulgencio Batista]], launching a failed attack on the [[Moncada Barracks]] in 1953</span>
				<span class='text'>After a year's imprisonment, he traveled to Mexico where he formed a revolutionary group, the [[26th of July Movement]], with [[Che Guevara]] and his brother [[Raúl Castro]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Returning to Cuba, Castro took a key role in the [[Cuban Revolution]] by leading the Movement in a [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]] against Batista's forces from the [[Sierra Maestra]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After Batista's overthrow in 1959, Castro assumed military and political power as Cuba's Prime Minister</span>
				<span class='text'>The United States was alarmed by Castro's friendly relations with the [[Soviet Union]], and unsuccessfully attempted to remove him by [[Assassination attempts on Fidel Castro|assassination]], [[United States embargo against Cuba|economic blockade]], and counter-revolution, including the [[Bay of Pigs invasion]] of 1961</span>
				<span class='text'>Countering these threats, Castro formed an alliance with the Soviets and allowed them to place nuclear weapons on the island, sparking the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] – a defining incident of the [[Cold War]] – in 1962</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;!--Establishing the Marxist-Leninist state, Presidency, and Retirement--&gt;Adopting a Marxist-Leninist model of development, Castro converted Cuba into a one-party socialist state under Communist Party rule; the first in the [[Western hemisphere]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Reforms introducing [[Economic planning|central economic planning]] and expanding [[Health care in Cuba|healthcare]] and [[Education in Cuba|education]] were accompanied by state control of the press and the suppression of internal dissent</span>
				<span class='text'>Abroad, Castro supported anti-imperialist revolutionary groups, backing the establishment of [[Marxism|Marxist]] governments in Chile, Nicaragua, and Grenada, and sending troops to aid allies in the [[Yom Kippur War]], [[Ethio-Somali War]], and [[Angolan Civil War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>These actions, coupled with Castro's leadership of the Non-Aligned Movement and [[Cuban medical internationalism|Cuba's medical internationalism]], increased Cuba's profile on the world stage and earned its leader great respect in the [[developing world]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Following the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union's dissolution]] in 1991, Castro led Cuba into its &quot;[[Special Period]]&quot; and embraced [[environmentalism|environmentalist]] and [[anti-globalization movement|anti-globalization]] ideas</span>
				<span class='text'>In the 2000s he forged alliances in the Latin American [[Pink tide|Pink Tide]] – namely with [[Hugo Chávez]]'s Venezuela – and signed Cuba to the [[Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 2006 he [[2006 Cuban transfer of presidential duties|transferred his responsibilities]] to Vice-President Raúl Castro, who formally assumed the presidency in 2008</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;!--Reception, legacy, and influence--&gt;Castro is a controversial and divisive world figure</span>
				<span class='text'>He is decorated with [[List of awards and honours bestowed upon Fidel Castro|various international awards]], and his supporters laud him as a champion of socialism, anti-imperialism, and [[humanitarianism]], whose revolutionary regime secured Cuba's independence from [[American imperialism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Conversely, critics view him as a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] [[dictator]] whose administration oversaw [[Human rights in Cuba|multiple human-rights abuses]], an [[Cuban exile|exodus of more than one million Cubans]], and the impoverishment of the country's economy</span>
				<span class='text'>Through his actions and his writings he has significantly influenced the politics of various individuals and groups across the world</span>
				<span class='text'>=Early life=={{Main|Early life of Fidel Castro}}===Youth: 1926–47===Castro was born out of wedlock at his father's farm on August 13, 1926</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He had become financially successful by growing sugar cane at Las Manacas farm in [[Birán]], [[Oriente Province]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|pp=14–15}}; {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|p=4}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|p=3}}; {{harvnb|Castro|Ramonet|2009|pp=24–29}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and after the collapse of his first marriage, he took his household servant, Lina Ruz González, as his mistress and later on second wife; together they had seven children, among them Fidel</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Aged 6, Castro was sent to live with his teacher in [[Santiago de Cuba]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quirk|1993|p=6}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|pp=5–6}}; {{harvnb|Castro|Ramonet|2009|pp=45–48, 52–57}}</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Being baptized enabled Castro to attend the La Salle boarding school in Santiago, where he regularly misbehaved, and so was sent to the privately funded, [[Jesuit]]-run Dolores School in Santiago</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quirk|1993|p=13}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|pp=6–7}}; {{harvnb|Castro|Ramonet|2009|pp=64–67}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In 1945 he transferred to the more prestigious Jesuit-run [[Belen Jesuit Preparatory School|El Colegio de Belén]] in [[Havana]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Although Castro took an interest in history, geography and debating at Belén, he did not excel academically, instead devoting much of his time to playing sport</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In 1945, Castro began studying law at the [[University of Havana]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Admitting he was &quot;politically illiterate&quot;, he became embroiled in student activism,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|pp=9–10}}; {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|pp=20, 22}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|pp=16–17}}; {{harvnb|Castro|Ramonet|2009|pp=91–93}}</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; he unsuccessfully campaigned for the presidency of the Federation of University Students on a platform of &quot;honesty, decency and justice&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|pp=32–33}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|pp=18–19}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Castro became critical of the corruption and violence of President [[Ramón Grau]]'s government, delivering a public speech on the subject in November 1946 that received coverage on the front page of several newspapers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|pp=34–37,63}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|pp=21–24}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In 1947, Castro joined the Party of the Cuban People (''[[Partido Ortodoxo]]''), founded by veteran politician [[Eduardo Chibás]]</span>
				<span class='text'>A charismatic figure, Chibás advocated social justice, honest government, and political freedom, while his party exposed corruption and demanded reform</span>
				<span class='text'>Though Chibás lost the election, Castro remained committed to working on his behalf</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Student violence escalated after Grau employed gang leaders as police officers, and Castro soon received a death threat urging him to leave the university; refusing, he began carrying a gun and surrounding himself with armed friends</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coltman|2003|pp=27–28}}; {{harvnb|Castro|Ramonet|2009|pp=95–97}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In later years anti-Castro dissidents accused him of committing gang-related assassinations at the time, but these remain unproven</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The invasion force consisted of around 1,200 troops, mostly Cubans and exiled Dominicans, and they intended to sail from Cuba in July 1947</span>
				<span class='text'>However, under U</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfnm|1a1=Bourne|1y=1986|1p=42|2a1=Coltman|2y=2003|2pp=34–35}} The protests, accompanied by a crackdown on those considered communists, led to violent clashes between activists and police in February 1948, in which Castro was badly beaten</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Coltman|2003|pp=36–37}} At this point his public speeches took on a distinctly leftist slant by condemning social and economic inequality in Cuba; in contrast, his former public criticisms had centered on condemning corruption and U</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Coltman|2003|pp=36–37}}In April 1948, Castro traveled to [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]], with a Cuban student group sponsored by President [[Juan Perón]]'s Argentine government</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Prío faced widespread protests when members of the MSR, now allied to the police force, assassinated Justo Fuentes, a socialist friend of Castro's</span>
				<span class='text'>In response, Prío agreed to quell the gangs, but found them too powerful to control</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coltman|2003|p=49}}</span>

				<span class='text'>He came to interpret Cuba's problems as an integral part of capitalist society, or the &quot;dictatorship of the bourgeoisie&quot;, rather than the failings of corrupt politicians, and adopted the Marxist view that meaningful political change could only be brought about by proletariat revolution</span>
				<span class='text'>Visiting Havana's poorest neighborhoods, he became active in the student [[anti-racism|anti-racist]] campaign</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Castro continued to put himself at risk, staying active in the city’s politics and joining the September 30 Movement, which contained within it both communists and members of the ''Partido Ortodoxo''</span>
				<span class='text'>The group’s purpose was to oppose the influence of the violent gangs within the university; despite his promises, Prío had failed to control the situation, instead offering many of their senior members jobs in government ministries</span>
