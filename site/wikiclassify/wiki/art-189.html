				<span class='text'>Dostoyevsky entered the academy in January 1838, but only with the help of family members</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=17‚Äì23}}{{sfn|Frank|1979|pp=69‚Äì90}}Dostoyevsky disliked the academy, primarily because of his lack of interest in science, mathematics and military engineering and his preference for drawing and architecture</span>

				<span class='text'>Although he was solitary and inhabited his own literary world, he was respected by his classmates</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lantz|2004|p=109}} After his father's death, Dostoyevsky continued his studies, passed his exams and obtained the rank of engineer cadet, entitling him to live away from the academy</span>
				<span class='text'>He visited Mikhail in Reval, and frequently attended concerts, operas, plays and ballets</span>
				<span class='text'>During this time, two of his friends introduced him to gambling</span>

				<span class='text'>His friend [[Dmitry Grigorovich]], with whom he was sharing an apartment at the time, took the manuscript to the poet [[Nikolay Nekrasov]], who in turn showed it to the renowned and influential literary critic [[Vissarion Belinsky]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Belinsky described it as Russia's first &quot;[[social novel]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Sekirin|1997|p=73}} ''Poor Folk'' was released on 15 January 1846 in the ''St Petersburg Collection'' [[almanac]] and became a commercial success</span>

				<span class='text'>Shortly thereafter, he wrote his second novel, ''[[The Double: A Petersburg Poem|The Double]]'', which appeared in the journal ''Notes of the Fatherland'' on 30 January 1846, before being published in February</span>
				<span class='text'>Around the same time, Dostoyevsky discovered socialism through the writings of French thinkers [[Charles Fourier|Fourier]], [[Cabet]], [[Proudhon]] and [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Through his relationship with Belinsky he expanded his knowledge of the philosophy of socialism</span>
				<span class='text'>He was attracted to its logic, its sense of justice and its preoccupation with the destitute and the disadvantaged</span>
				<span class='text'>However, his relationship with Belinsky became increasingly strained as Belinsky's [[atheism]] and dislike of religion clashed with Dostoyevsky's Russian Orthodox beliefs</span>
				<span class='text'>Dostoyevsky eventually parted with him and his associates</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Frank|1979|pp=159‚Äì82}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=53‚Äì5}}After ''The Double'' received negative reviews, Dostoyevsky's health declined and he had more frequent seizures, but he continued writing</span>
				<span class='text'>From 1846 to 1848 he released several short stories in the magazine ''Annals of the Fatherland'', including &quot;[[Mr</span>

				<span class='text'>These stories were unsuccessful, leaving Dostoyevsky once more in financial trouble, so he joined the [[Utopian Socialism|utopian socialist]] Betekov circle, a tightly knit community which helped him to survive</span>
				<span class='text'>When the circle dissolved, Dostoyevsky befriended [[Apollon Maykov]] and his brother [[Valerian Maykov|Valerian]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1846, on the recommendation of the poet [[Aleksey Pleshcheyev]],{{sfn|Mochulsky|1967|pp=115‚Äì21}} he joined the [[Christian socialism|socio-Christian]] [[Petrashevsky Circle]], founded by [[Mikhail Petrashevsky]], who had proposed social reforms in Russia</span>

				<span class='text'>Antonelli, the government agent who had reported the group, wrote in his statement that at least one of the papers criticised Russian politics and religion</span>
				<span class='text'>Dostoyevsky responded to these charges by declaring that he had read the essays only &quot;as a literary monument, neither more nor less&quot;; he spoke of &quot;personality and human egoism&quot; rather than of politics</span>

				<span class='text'>Before his arrest for participating in the Petrashevsky Circle in 1849, Dostoyevsky remarked, &quot;As far as I am concerned, nothing was ever more ridiculous than the idea of a [[Republicanism|republican]] government in Russia</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; In an 1881 edition of his ''Diaries'', Dostoyevsky &lt;!-- &quot;favoured republicanism&quot; Contradictory? --&gt; stated that the Tsar and the people should form a unity: &quot;For the people, the tsar is not an external power, not the power of some conqueror&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>but a power of all the people, an all-unifying power the people themselves desired</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Lantz|2004|pp=183‚Äì89}}While critical of serfdom, Dostoyevsky was skeptical about the creation of a [[constitutional monarchy|constitution]], a concept he viewed as unrelated to Russia's history</span>
				<span class='text'>He described it as a mere &quot;gentleman's rule&quot; and believed that &quot;a constitution would simply enslave the people&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He advocated social change instead, for example removal of the feudal system and a weakening of the divisions between the peasantry and the affluent classes</span>
				<span class='text'>His ideal was a [[utopia]]n, Christianized Russia where &quot;if everyone were actively Christian, not a single social question would come up&amp;nbsp;</span>

				<span class='text'>He thought that contemporary western Europe had &quot;rejected the single formula for their salvation that came from God and was proclaimed through revelation, 'Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself', and replaced it with practical conclusions such as, {{'}}''Chacun pour soi et Dieu pour tous''{{'}} [Every man for himself and God for all], or &quot;scientific&quot; slogans like '[[Survival of the fittest|the struggle for survival]]{{'&quot;}}</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lantz|2004|pp=183‚Äì89}} He considered this crisis to be the consequence of the collision between communal and individual interests, brought about by a decline in religious and moral principles</span>
				<span class='text'>ostoyevsky distinguished three &quot;enormous world ideas&quot; prevalent in his time: Roman Catholicism, [[Protestantism]] and [[Russian Orthodox]]y</span>
				<span class='text'>He claimed that Catholicism had continued the tradition of [[Roman Empire|Imperial Rome]] and had thus become anti-Christian and proto-socialist, inasmuch as the Church's interest in political and mundane affairs led it to abandon the idea of Christ</span>

				<span class='text'>Several critics, such as [[Nikolay Dobrolyubov]], [[Ivan Bunin]] and [[Vladimir Nabokov]], viewed his writing as excessively psychological and philosophical rather than artistic</span>
				<span class='text'>Others found fault with chaotic and disorganised plots, and others, like Turgenev, objected to &quot;excessive psychologising&quot; and too-detailed naturalism</span>
				<span class='text'>His style was deemed &quot;prolix, repetitious and lacking in polish, balance, restraint and good taste&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Saltykov-Shchedrin]], Tolstoy, [[Nikolay Mikhaylovsky]] and others criticised his puppet-like characters, most prominently in ''The Idiot'', ''The Possessed'' and ''The Brothers Karamazov''</span>
				<span class='text'>These characters were compared to those of Hoffmann, an author whom Dostoyevsky admired</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Terras|1998|pp=3‚Äì4}}Basing his estimation on stated criteria of enduring art and individual genius, Nabokov judges Dostoyevsky &quot;not a great writer, but rather a mediocre one‚Äîwith flashes of excellent humour but, alas, with wastelands of literary platitudes in between&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Nabokov complains that the novels are peopled by &quot;neurotics and lunatics&quot; and states that Dostoyevsky's characters do not develop: &quot;We get them all complete at the beginning of the tale and so they remain</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He finds the novels full of contrived &quot;surprises and complications of plot&quot;, which are effective when first read, but on second reading, without the shock and benefit of these surprises, appear loaded with &quot;glorified clich√©&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Makar's tender, sentimental adoration for Varvara and her confident, warm friendship for him explain their evident preference for a simple life, although it keeps them in humiliating poverty</span>
				<span class='text'>An unscrupulous merchant finds the inexperienced girl and hires her as his housewife and guarantor</span>
				<span class='text'>He sends her to a manor somewhere on a steppe, while Makar alleviates his misery and pain with alcohol</span>
				<span class='text'>he story focuses on poor people who struggle with their lack of self-esteem</span>
				<span class='text'>Their misery leads to the loss of their inner freedom, to dependence on the social authorities, and to the extinction of their individuality</span>
				<span class='text'>Dostoyevsky shows how poverty and dependence are indissolubly aligned with deflection and deformation of self-esteem, combining inward and outerward suffering</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=69‚Äì103}};Notes from Underground{{Main|Notes from Underground}}''Notes from Underground'' is split into two stylistically different parts, the first essay-like, the second in narrative style</span>
				<span class='text'>The protagonist and [[first-person narrator]] is an unnamed 40-year-old civil servant known as The Underground Man</span>
				<span class='text'>The only known facts about his situation are that he has quit the service, lives in a basement flat on the outskirts of Saint Petersburg and finances his livelihood from a modest inheritance</span>
				<span class='text'>he first part is a record of his thoughts about society and his character</span>
				<span class='text'>He describes himself as vicious, squalid and ugly; the chief focuses of his [[polemic]] are the &quot;modern human&quot; and his vision of the world, which he attacks severely and cynically, and towards which he develops aggression and vengefulness</span>
				<span class='text'>He considers his own decline natural and necessary</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he emphasises that he does not intend to publish his notes for the public, the narrator appeals repeatedly to an ill-described audience, whose questions he tries to address</span>
				<span class='text'>n the second part he describes scenes from his life that are responsible for his failure in personal and professional life and in his love life</span>
				<span class='text'>He tells of meeting old school friends, who are in secure positions and treat him with condescension</span>
				<span class='text'>His aggression turns inward on to himself and he tries to humiliate himself further</span>
				<span class='text'>He presents himself as a possible saviour to the poor prostitute Lisa, advising her to reject self-reproach when she looks to him for hope</span>
				<span class='text'>Dostoyevsky added a short commentary saying that although the storyline and characters are fictional, such things were inevitable in contemporary society</span>

				<span class='text'>Strakhov liked the novel, remarking that &quot;Only ''Crime and Punishment'' was read in 1866&quot; and that Dostoyevsky had managed to portray a Russian person aptly and realistically</span>

				<span class='text'>Scorned by Saint Petersburg society for his trusting nature and naivety, he finds himself at the center of a struggle between a beautiful kept woman, (Nastasya), and a jealous but pretty young girl, (Aglaja), both of whom win his affection</span>
				<span class='text'>Unfortunately, Myshkin's goodness precipitates disaster, leaving the impression that, in a world obsessed with money, power and sexual conquest, a sanatorium may be the only place for a saint</span>
				<span class='text'>Myshkin is the personification of a &quot;relatively beautiful man&quot;, namely Christ</span>
				<span class='text'>Coming &quot;from above&quot; (the Swiss mountains), he physically resembles common depictions of Jesus Christ: slightly larger than average, with thick, blond hair, sunken cheeks and a thin, almost entirely white goatee</span>
				<span class='text'>Like Christ, Myshkin is a teacher, confessor and mysterious outsider</span>
				<span class='text'>Passions such as greed and jealousy are alien to him</span>
				<span class='text'>In contrast to those around him, he puts no value on money and power</span>
				<span class='text'>He feels compassion and love, sincerely, without judgement</span>
				<span class='text'>His relationship with the immoral Nastasya is obviously inspired by Christ's relationship with [[Mary Magdalene]]</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=310‚Äì322}} The novel takes place in a provincial Russian setting, primarily on the estates of Stepan Verkhovensky and Varvara Stavrogina</span>
				<span class='text'>Stepan's son Pyotr is an aspiring revolutionary conspirator who attempts to organise revolutionaries in the area</span>
				<span class='text'>He considers Varvara's son Nikolai central to his plot, because he thinks that Nikolai lacks sympathy for mankind</span>
				<span class='text'>Pyotr gathers conspirators such as the philosophising Shigalyov, the suicidal Kirillov and the former military man Virginsky</span>
				<span class='text'>He schemes to consolidate their loyalty to him and each other by murdering Ivan Shatov, a fellow conspirator</span>
				<span class='text'>Pyotr plans to have Kirillov, who is committed to killing himself, take credit for the murder in his suicide note</span>
				<span class='text'>Kirillov complies and Pyotr murders Shatov, but his scheme goes awry</span>
				<span class='text'>Pyotr escapes, but the remainder of his aspiring revolutionary crew is arrested</span>
				<span class='text'>In the denouement, Nikolai kills himself, tortured by his own misdeeds</span>
				<span class='text'>The Brothers Karamazov{{Main|The Brothers Karamazov}}At nearly 800 pages, ''The Brothers Karamazov'' is Dostoyevsky's largest work</span>
				<span class='text'>It received both critical and popular acclaim and is often cited as his ''[[magnum opus]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Frank|2003|pp=390‚Äì441}} Composed of 12 &quot;books&quot;, the novel tells the story of the novice [[Alyosha Karamazov]], the non-believer Ivan Karamazov and the soldier Dmitri Karamazov</span>
				<span class='text'>The first books introduce the Karamazovs</span>
				<span class='text'>The main plot is the death of their father Fyodor, while other parts are philosophical and religious arguments by Father Zosima to Alyosha</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Frank|1997|pp=567‚Äì705}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=337‚Äì414}}The most famous chapter is &quot;[[The Grand Inquisitor]]&quot;, a [[parable]] told by Ivan to Alyosha about Christ's [[Second Coming]] in [[Seville]], Spain, in which Christ is imprisoned by a ninety-year-old Catholic [[Grand Inquisitor]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead of answering him, Christ gives him a kiss, and the Inquisitor subsequently releases him, telling him not to return</span>
				<span class='text'>The tale was misunderstood as a defence of the Inquisitor, but some, such as [[Romano Guardini]], have argued that the Christ of the parable was Ivan's own interpretation of Christ, &quot;the idealistic product of the unbelief&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Ivan, however, has stated that he is against Christ</span>
				<span class='text'>Most contemporary critics and scholars agree that Dostoyevsky is attacking Roman Catholicism and socialist atheism, both represented by the Inquisitor</span>
