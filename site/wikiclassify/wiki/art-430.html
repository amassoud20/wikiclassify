				<span class='text'>Kahnweiler was a German art historian and art collector who became one of the premier French art dealers of the 20th century</span>
				<span class='text'>He was among the first champions of Pablo Picasso, [[Georges Braque]] and the [[Cubism]] that they jointly developed</span>

				<span class='text'>Picasso and Braque's paintings at this time share many similarities</span>
				<span class='text'>Synthetic cubism (1912–1919) was a further development of the genre, in which cut paper fragments&amp;nbsp;– often wallpaper or portions of newspaper pages&amp;nbsp;– were pasted into compositions, marking the first use of [[collage]] in fine art</span>
				<span class='text'>n Paris, Picasso entertained a distinguished coterie of friends in the [[Montmartre]] and Montparnasse quarters, including [[André Breton]], poet [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], writer [[Alfred Jarry]], and Gertrude Stein</span>
				<span class='text'>Apollinaire was arrested on suspicion of stealing the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' from the [[Louvre]] in 1911</span>

				<span class='text'>Among his friends during this period were [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Jean Hugo]], [[Juan Gris]], and others</span>
				<span class='text'>In the summer of 1918, Picasso married [[Olga Khokhlova]], a ballerina with [[Sergei Diaghilev]]'s troupe, for whom Picasso was designing a ballet, [[Erik Satie]]'s ''[[Parade (ballet)|Parade]]'', in Rome; they spent their honeymoon near [[Biarritz]] in the villa of glamorous Chilean art patron [[Eugenia Errázuriz]]</span>
				<span class='text'>fter return from honeymoon, and in desperate need of money, Picasso started his exclusive relationship with the French-Jewish art dealer [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Khokhlova's insistence on social propriety clashed with Picasso's [[bohemianism|bohemian]] tendencies and the two lived in a state of constant conflict</span>
				<span class='text'>During the same period that Picasso collaborated with Diaghilev's troupe, he and [[Igor Stravinsky]] collaborated on ''[[Pulcinella (ballet)|Pulcinella]]'' in 1920</span>
				<span class='text'>Picasso took the opportunity to make several drawings of the composer</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1927 Picasso met 17-year-old [[Marie-Thérèse Walter]] and began a secret affair with her</span>
				<span class='text'>Picasso's marriage to Khokhlova soon ended in separation rather than divorce, as French law required an even division of property in the case of divorce, and Picasso did not want Khokhlova to have half his wealth</span>
				<span class='text'>The two remained legally married until Khokhlova's death in 1955</span>
				<span class='text'>Picasso carried on a long-standing affair with Marie-Thérèse Walter and fathered a daughter with her, named Maya</span>
				<span class='text'>Marie-Thérèse lived in the vain hope that Picasso would one day marry her, and hanged herself four years after Picasso's death</span>
				<span class='text'>Throughout his life Picasso maintained several mistresses in addition to his wife or primary partner</span>
				<span class='text'>Picasso was married twice and had four children by three women:* Paulo (4 February 1921 – 5 June 1975) (Born Paul Joseph Picasso) – with [[Olga Khokhlova]]* Maya (5 September 1935 – ) (Born Maria de la Concepcion Picasso) – with [[Marie-Thérèse Walter]]* [[Claude Picasso|Claude]] (15 May 1947&amp;nbsp;–) (Born Claude Pierre Pablo Picasso) – with [[Françoise Gilot]]* [[Paloma Picasso|Paloma]] (19 April 1949&amp;nbsp;– ) (Born Anne Paloma Picasso) – with [[Françoise Gilot]]Photographer and painter [[Dora Maar]] was also a constant companion and lover of Picasso</span>

				<span class='text'>''Les Demoiselles'' was reproduced for the first time in Europe in the same issue</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet Picasso exhibited Cubist works at the first Surrealist group exhibition in 1925; the concept of 'psychic automatism in its pure state' defined in the ''Manifeste du surréalisme'' never appealed to him entirely</span>

				<span class='text'>In the 1950s, Picasso's style changed once again, as he took to producing reinterpretations of the art of the great masters</span>
				<span class='text'>He made a [[Las Meninas (Picasso)|series]] of works based on [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]]'s painting of ''[[Las Meninas]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>He also based paintings on works by [[Francisco Goya|Goya]], [[Nicolas Poussin|Poussin]], [[Édouard Manet|Manet]], [[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]] and [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]]</span>

				<span class='text'>He approached the project with a great deal of enthusiasm, designing a sculpture which was ambiguous and somewhat controversial</span>
				<span class='text'>What the figure represents is not known; it could be a bird, a horse, a woman or a totally abstract shape</span>
				<span class='text'>The sculpture, one of the most recognizable landmarks in downtown Chicago, was unveiled in 1967</span>
				<span class='text'>Picasso refused to be paid $100,000 for it, donating it to the people of the city</span>
				<span class='text'>icasso's final works were a mixture of styles, his means of expression in constant flux until the end of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>Devoting his full energies to his work, Picasso became more daring, his works more colorful and expressive, and from 1968 to 1971 he produced a torrent of paintings and hundreds of copperplate etchings</span>
				<span class='text'>At the time these works were dismissed by most as pornographic fantasies of an impotent old man or the slapdash works of an artist who was past his prime</span>
				<span class='text'>Only later, after Picasso's death, when the rest of the art world had moved on from abstract expressionism, did the critical community come to see that Picasso had already discovered [[Neo-Expressionism]] and was, as so often before, ahead of his time</span>

				<span class='text'>He had also remained aloof from the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] independence movement during his youth despite expressing general support and being friendly with activists within it</span>
				<span class='text'>At the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1937, Picasso was already in his late fifties</span>
				<span class='text'>He was even older at the onset of World War II, and could not be expected to take up arms in those conflicts</span>

				<span class='text'>While Picasso expressed anger and condemnation of [[Francisco Franco]] and fascists through his art, he did not take up arms against them</span>
				<span class='text'>The Spanish Civil War provided the impetus for Picasso's first overtly [[The arts and politics|political work]], ''[[The Dream and Lie of Franco]]'' which was produced &quot;specifically for propagandistic and fundraising purposes</span>

				<span class='text'>For example, his paintings of 1917 included the [[pointillist]] ''Woman with a Mantilla'', the Cubist ''Figure in an Armchair'', and the naturalistic ''Harlequin'' (all in the [[Museu Picasso]], Barcelona)</span>

				<span class='text'>''The Nation'' '''263''' (6): 31–35</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The art critic [[Arthur Danto]] said Picasso's work constitutes a &quot;vast pictorial autobiography&quot; that provides some basis for the popular conception that &quot;Picasso invented a new style each time he fell in love with a new woman&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Danto_1996&quot;/&gt; The autobiographical nature of Picasso's art is reinforced by his habit of dating his works, often to the day</span>
				<span class='text'>He explained: &quot;I want to leave to posterity a documentation that will be as complete as possible</span>
				<span class='text'>That's why I put a date on everything I do</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Danto_1996&quot;/&gt;== Artistic legacy ==At the time of Picasso's death many of his paintings were in his possession, as he had kept off the art market what he did not need to sell</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, Picasso had a considerable collection of the work of other famous artists, some his contemporaries, such as [[Henri Matisse]], with whom he had exchanged works</span>
				<span class='text'>Since Picasso left no will, his death duties (estate tax) to the French state were paid in the form of his works and others from his collection</span>
				<span class='text'>These works form the core of the immense and representative collection of the [[Musée Picasso]] in Paris</span>
				<span class='text'>In 2003, relatives of Picasso inaugurated a museum dedicated to him in his birthplace, Málaga, Spain, the [[Museo Picasso Málaga]]</span>
				<span class='text'>he [[Museu Picasso]] in Barcelona features many of his early works, created while he was living in Spain, including many rarely seen works which reveal his firm grounding in classical techniques</span>
				<span class='text'>The museum also holds many precise and detailed figure studies done in his youth under his father's tutelage, as well as the extensive collection of Jaime Sabartés, his close friend and personal secretary</span>
