				<span class='text'>Hippocrates was probably trained at the [[Asclepieion|asklepieion]] of [[Kos]], and took lessons from the [[Thrace|Thracian]] physician [[Herodicus|Herodicus of Selymbria]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Plato]] mentions Hippocrates in two of his dialogues: in ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]'', Plato describes Hippocrates as &quot;Hippocrates of Kos, the [[Asclepiad (Greek)|Asclepiad]]&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;marti86&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Martí-Ibáñez|1961|pp=86–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Plato380|Plato 380 B</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>]&lt;/ref&gt; while in ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'', Plato suggests that &quot;Hippocrates the Asclepiad&quot; thought that a complete knowledge of the nature of the body was necessary for medicine</span>

				<span class='text'>270c]]&lt;/ref&gt; Hippocrates taught and practiced medicine throughout his life, traveling at least as far as [[Thessaly]], [[Thrace]], and the [[Sea of Marmara]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;margotta66&quot;/&gt; Several different accounts of his death exist</span>
				<span class='text'>He died, probably in [[Larissa]], at the age of 83, 85 or 90, though some say he lived to be well over 100</span>

				<span class='text'>Men regard its nature and cause as divine from ignorance and wonder</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>'|Hippocrates, ''On the Sacred Disease''}}Hippocrates is credited with being the first person to believe that diseases were caused naturally, not because of superstition and gods</span>
				<span class='text'>Hippocrates was credited by the disciples of [[Pythagoras]] of allying philosophy and medicine</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;philosophy&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Adams|1891|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He separated the discipline of medicine from religion, believing and arguing that disease was not a punishment inflicted by the [[Greek gods|gods]] but rather the product of environmental factors, diet, and living habits</span>
				<span class='text'>Indeed there is not a single mention of a mystical illness in the entirety of the Hippocratic Corpus</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Hippocrates did work with many convictions that were based on what is now known to be incorrect [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]], such as [[Humorism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;jones11&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Jones|1868|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nuland8&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Nuland|1988|pp=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;garrison9394&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|pp=93–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;Ancient Greek schools of medicine were split (into the Knidian and Koan) on how to deal with disease</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Knidos|Knidian]] school of medicine focused on diagnosis</span>
				<span class='text'> Medicine at the time of Hippocrates knew almost nothing of human anatomy and physiology because of the Greek [[taboo]] forbidding the dissection of humans</span>
				<span class='text'>The Knidian school consequently failed to distinguish when one disease caused many possible series of symptoms</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;adams15&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Adams|1891|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hippocratic school or [[Kos|Koan]] school achieved greater success by applying general [[medical diagnosis|diagnoses]] and passive treatments</span>
				<span class='text'>Its focus was on patient care and [[prognosis]], not [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It could effectively treat diseases and allowed for a great development in clinical practice</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;margotta67&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Margotta|1968|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leff|Leff|1956|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;Hippocratic medicine and its philosophy are far removed from that of modern medicine</span>
				<span class='text'>Now, the physician focuses on specific diagnosis and specialized treatment, both of which were espoused by the Knidian school</span>
				<span class='text'>This shift in medical thought since Hippocrates' day has caused serious criticism over the past two millennia, with the passivity of Hippocratic treatment being the subject of particularly strong denunciations;&lt;!--It seems to me that something is missing here</span>
				<span class='text'>Hippocrates used methods that succeeded at his time, when medical knowledge was insufficiently advanced to allow for diagnoses or specialized treatments; at that time, attending to the general wellness of the patient was often the best way to allow their own immune system to fight off a disease</span>
				<span class='text'>I'm almost certain I've seen this opinion in writing somewhere, and if it can be found it should be included</span>
				<span class='text'>-&gt; for example, the [[French people|French]] doctor M</span>
				<span class='text'>S</span>
				<span class='text'>Houdart called the Hippocratic treatment a &quot;meditation upon death&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;jones1213&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Jones|1868|pp=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;===Crisis===Another important concept in Hippocratic medicine was that of a ''crisis'', a point in the progression of disease at which either the illness would begin to triumph and the patient would succumb to death, or the opposite would occur and natural processes would make the patient recover</span>
				<span class='text'>After a crisis, a relapse might follow, and then another deciding crisis</span>
				<span class='text'>According to this doctrine, crises tend to occur on ''critical days'', which were supposed to be a fixed time after the contraction of a disease</span>
				<span class='text'>If a crisis occurred on a day far from a ''critical day'', a relapse might be expected</span>
				<span class='text'>Galen believed that this idea originated with Hippocrates, though it is possible that it predated him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;jones464859&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Jones|1868|pp=46,48,59}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:HippocraticBench</span>
				<span class='text'>ng|thumb|300px|Illustration of a [[Hippocratic bench]], date unknown]]Hippocratic medicine was humble and passive</span>
				<span class='text'>The therapeutic approach was based on &quot;the healing power of nature&quot; (&quot;''[[vis medicatrix naturae]]''&quot; in [[Latin]])</span>
				<span class='text'>According to this doctrine, the body contains within itself the power to re-balance the four humours and heal itself (''physis'')</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;garrison99&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hippocratic therapy focused on simply easing this natural process</span>
				<span class='text'>To this end, Hippocrates believed &quot;rest and immobilization [were] of capital importance</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;margotta73&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Margotta|1968|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the Hippocratic medicine was very kind to the patient; treatment was gentle, and emphasized keeping the patient clean and sterile</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, only clean water or wine were ever used on wounds, though &quot;dry&quot; treatment was preferable</span>
				<span class='text'>Soothing [[Liniment|balms]] were sometimes employed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;garrison98&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;Hippocrates was reluctant to administer drugs and engage in specialized treatment that might prove to be wrongly chosen; generalized therapy followed a generalized diagnosis</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;garrison98&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sing35&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Singer|Underwood|1962|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generalized treatments he prescribed include fasting and the consumption of apple cider vinegar</span>
				<span class='text'>Hippocrates once said that &quot;to eat when you are sick, is to feed your sickness</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; However, potent drugs were used on certain occasions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Encyclopædia Britannica|1911}}&lt;/ref&gt; This passive approach was very successful in treating relatively simple ailments such as broken bones which required [[Traction (orthopedics)|traction]] to stretch the skeletal system and relieve pressure on the injured area</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Hippocratic bench]] and other devices were used to this end</span>
				<span class='text'>ne of the strengths of Hippocratic medicine was its emphasis on [[prognosis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>At Hippocrates' time, medicinal therapy was quite immature, and often the best thing that physicians could do was to evaluate an illness and predict its likely progression based upon data collected in detailed case histories</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;garrison&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Garrison|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hippocratic work ''On the Physician'' recommends that physicians always be well-kempt, honest, calm, understanding, and serious</span>
				<span class='text'>The Hippocratic physician paid careful attention to all aspects of his practice: he followed detailed specifications for, &quot;lighting, personnel, instruments, positioning of the patient, and techniques of bandaging and splinting&quot; in the ancient [[operating room]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;margotta64&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Margotta|1968|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; He even kept his [[fingernail]]s to a precise length</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;rutkow24&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Rutkow|1993|pp=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;The Hippocratic School gave importance to the clinical doctrines of observation and documentation</span>
				<span class='text'>These doctrines dictate that physicians record their findings and their medicinal methods in a very clear and objective manner, so that these records may be passed down and employed by other physicians</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;margotta66&quot;/&gt; Hippocrates made careful, regular note of many symptoms including complexion, pulse, fever, pains, movement, and excretions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;garrison97&quot;/&gt; He is said to have measured a patient's pulse when taking a case history to discover whether the patient was lying</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;marti88&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Martí-Ibáñez|1961|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hippocrates extended clinical observations into family history and environment</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;garrison9394&quot;/&gt; For this reason, he may more properly be termed as the &quot;Father of Medicine&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;hanson&quot;/&gt; His contributions revolutionized the practice of medicine; but after his death the advancement stalled</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;garrison100&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; So revered was Hippocrates that his teachings were largely taken as too great to be improved upon and no significant advancements of his methods were made for a long time</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;marti86&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;margotta73&quot;/&gt; The centuries after Hippocrates' death were marked as much by retrograde movement as by further advancement</span>
				<span class='text'>For instance, &quot;after the Hippocratic period, the practice of taking clinical case-histories died out,&quot; according to [[Fielding H</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;garrison95&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;After Hippocrates, the next significant physician was [[Galen]], a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] who lived from AD 129 to AD 200</span>
				<span class='text'>Galen perpetuated Hippocratic medicine, moving both forward and backward</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;jones35&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Jones|1868|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Middle Ages]], the Islamic world adopted Hippocratic methods and developed new medical technologies</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leff|Leff|1956|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[European Renaissance]], Hippocratic methods were revived in western Europe and even further expanded in the 19th century</span>
				<span class='text'>Notable among those who employed Hippocrates' rigorous clinical techniques were [[Thomas Sydenham]], [[William Heberden]], [[Jean-Martin Charcot]] and [[William Osler]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Henri Huchard]], a French physician, said that these revivals make up &quot;the whole history of internal medicine</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;jones38&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Jones|1868|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning his disposition, Hippocrates was first portrayed as a &quot;kind, dignified, old country doctor&quot; and later as &quot;stern and forbidding&quot;</span>
