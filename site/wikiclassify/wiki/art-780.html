				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|upright=1|Porter in the 1930s]]'''Cole Albert Porter''' (June 9, 1891&amp;nbsp;– October 15, 1964) was an American composer and songwriter</span>
				<span class='text'>Born to a wealthy family in [[Indiana]], he defied the wishes of his domineering grandfather and took up music as a profession</span>
				<span class='text'>Classically trained, he was drawn towards [[musical theatre]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After a slow start, he began to achieve success in the 1920s, and by the 1930s he was one of the major songwriters for the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical stage</span>
				<span class='text'>Unlike many successful Broadway composers, Porter wrote the lyrics, as well as the music, for his songs</span>
				<span class='text'>fter a serious horseback riding accident in 1937, Porter was left disabled and in constant pain, but he continued to work</span>
				<span class='text'>His shows of the early 1940s did not contain the lasting hits of his best work of the 1920s and '30s, but in 1948 he made a triumphant comeback with his most successful musical, ''[[Kiss Me, Kate]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>It won the first [[Tony Award for Best Musical]]</span>
				<span class='text'>orter's other musicals include ''[[Fifty Million Frenchmen]]'', ''[[DuBarry Was a Lady]]'', ''[[Anything Goes]]'', ''[[Can-Can (musical)|Can-Can]]'' and ''[[Silk Stockings]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>His numerous hit songs include &quot;[[Night and Day (song)|Night and Day]]&quot;, &quot;[[Begin the Beguine]]&quot;, &quot;[[I Get a Kick Out of You]]&quot;, &quot;[[Well, Did You Evah!]]&quot;, &quot;[[I've Got You Under My Skin]]&quot;, &quot;[[My Heart Belongs to Daddy]]&quot; and &quot;[[You're the Top]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He also composed scores for films from the 1930s to the 1950s, including ''[[Born to Dance]]'' (1936), which featured the song &quot;[[You'd Be So Easy to Love]]&quot;; ''[[Rosalie (film)|Rosalie]]'' (1937), which featured &quot;[[In the Still of the Night (1937 song)|In the Still of the Night]]&quot;; ''[[High Society (1956 film)|High Society]]'' (1956), which included &quot;[[True Love (song)|True Love]]&quot;; and ''[[Les Girls]]'' (1957)</span>
