				<span class='text'>quot; ''Down and Out in Paris and London'' was published on 9 January 1933, as Orwell continued to work on ''Burmese Days''</span>
				<span class='text'>''Down and Out'' was successful and was next published by Harper and Brothers in New York</span>
				<span class='text'>n mid-1933 Blair left Hawthorns to become a teacher at [[Frays River|Frays College]], in [[Uxbridge]], West London</span>
				<span class='text'>This was a much larger establishment with 200 pupils and a full complement of staff</span>
				<span class='text'>He acquired a motorcycle and took trips through the surrounding countryside</span>
				<span class='text'>On one of these expeditions he became soaked and caught a chill that developed into pneumonia</span>
				<span class='text'>He was taken to Uxbridge Cottage Hospital, where for a time his life was believed to be in danger</span>
				<span class='text'>When he was discharged in January 1934, he returned to Southwold to convalesce and, supported by his parents, never returned to teaching</span>
				<span class='text'>e was disappointed when Gollancz turned down ''Burmese Days'', mainly on the grounds of potential suits for libel, but [[Harper (publisher)|Harper]] were prepared to publish it in the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>Meanwhile, Blair started work on the novel ''[[A Clergyman's Daughter]]'', drawing upon his life as a teacher and on life in Southwold</span>
				<span class='text'>Eleanor Jacques was now married and had gone to Singapore and Brenda Salkield had left for Ireland, so Blair was relatively isolated in Southwold—working on the [[allotment (gardening)|allotments]], walking alone and spending time with his father</span>
				<span class='text'>Eventually in October, after sending ''A Clergyman's Daughter'' to Moore, he left for London to take a job that had been found for him by his Aunt Nellie Limouzin</span>

				<span class='text'>The Westropes were friendly and provided him with comfortable accommodation at Warwick Mansions, Pond Street</span>
				<span class='text'>He was sharing the job with [[Jon Kimche]], who also lived with the Westropes</span>
				<span class='text'>Blair worked at the shop in the afternoons and had his mornings free to write and his evenings free to socialise</span>
				<span class='text'>These experiences provided background for the novel ''[[Keep the Aspidistra Flying]]'' (1936)</span>
				<span class='text'>As well as the various guests of the Westropes, he was able to enjoy the company of Richard Rees and the ''Adelphi'' writers and Mabel Fierz</span>
				<span class='text'>The Westropes and Kimche were members of the [[Independent Labour Party]], although at this time Blair was not seriously politically active</span>
				<span class='text'>He was writing for the ''Adelphi'' and preparing ''A Clergyman's Daughter'' and ''Burmese Days'' for publication</span>

				<span class='text'>uring this time, he was distracted by concerns about style and possible libel in ''Keep the Aspidistra Flying''</span>

				<span class='text'>Conditions at the farmhouse were primitive but the natural history and the challenge of improving the place appealed to Orwell</span>
				<span class='text'>His sister Avril accompanied him there and young novelist [[Paul Potts (writer)|Paul Potts]] made up the party</span>
				<span class='text'>In July Susan Watson arrived with Orwell's son Richard</span>
				<span class='text'>Tensions developed and Potts departed after one of his manuscripts was used to light the fire</span>
				<span class='text'>Orwell meanwhile set to work on ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Later Susan Watson's boyfriend [[David Holbrook]] arrived</span>
				<span class='text'>A fan of Orwell since school days, he found the reality very different, with Orwell hostile and disagreeable probably because of Holbrook's membership of the Communist Party</span>

				<span class='text'>Now a well-known writer, he was swamped with work</span>
				<span class='text'>Apart from a visit to Jura in the new year he stayed in London for [[Winter of 1946–1947 in the United Kingdom|one of the coldest British winters on record]] and with such a national shortage of fuel that he burnt his furniture and his child's toys</span>
				<span class='text'>The heavy smog in the days before the [[Clean Air Act 1956]] did little to help his health about which he was reticent, keeping clear of medical attention</span>
				<span class='text'>Meanwhile, he had to cope with rival claims of publishers Gollancz and Warburg for publishing rights</span>
				<span class='text'>About this time he co-edited a collection titled ''British Pamphleteers'' with [[Reginald Reynolds]]</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result of the success of ''Animal Farm'', Orwell was expecting a large bill from the Inland Revenue and he contacted a firm of accountants of which the senior partner was Jack Harrison</span>
				<span class='text'>The firm advised Orwell to establish a company to own his copyright and to receive his royalties and set up a &quot;service agreement&quot; so that he could draw a salary</span>
				<span class='text'>Such a company &quot;George Orwell Productions Ltd&quot; (GOP Ltd) was set up on 12 September 1947 although the service agreement was not then put into effect</span>

				<span class='text'>he sanatorium at Cranham consisted of a series of small wooden chalets or huts in a remote part of the [[Cotswolds]] near [[Stroud]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Kirwan had just started working for a [[Foreign Office]] unit, the [[Information Research Department]], set up by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government to publish anti-communist propaganda, and Orwell gave her a list of people he considered to be unsuitable as IRD authors because of their pro-communist leanings</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Carroll/&gt;==Literary career and legacy==During most of his career, Orwell was best known for his journalism, in essays, reviews, columns in newspapers and magazines and in his books of reportage: ''[[Down and Out in Paris and London]]'' (describing a period of poverty in these cities), ''[[The Road to Wigan Pier]]'' (describing the living conditions of the poor in northern England, and class division generally) and ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>According to [[Irving Howe]], Orwell was &quot;the best English essayist since [[William Hazlitt|Hazlitt]], perhaps since [[Samuel Johnson|Dr Johnson]]</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howe&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|authorlink=Irving Howe|title=George Orwell: &quot;As the bones know&quot;|first=Irving|last=Howe|work=[[Harper's Magazine]]|date= January 1969}}(reprinted in ''[[Newsweek]]'')</span>
				<span class='text'>Howe considered Orwell &quot;the finest journalist of his day and the foremost architect of the English essay since [[William Hazlitt|Hazlitt]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Modern readers are more often introduced to Orwell as a novelist, particularly through his enormously successful titles ''[[Animal Farm]]'' and ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The former is often thought to reflect degeneration in the Soviet Union after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and the rise of [[Stalinism]]; the latter, life under [[totalitarianism|totalitarian rule]]</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' is often compared to ''[[Brave New World]]'' by [[Aldous Huxley]]; both are powerful [[dystopia]]n novels warning of a future world where the state machine exerts complete control over social life</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1984, ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' and [[Ray Bradbury]]'s ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'' were honoured with the [[Prometheus Award]] for their contributions to dystopian literature</span>
				<span class='text'>In 2011 he received it again for ''Animal Farm''</span>
				<span class='text'>'[[Coming Up for Air]]'', his last novel before World War II is the most &quot;English&quot; of his novels; alarms of war mingle with images of idyllic [[Thames]]-side [[Edwardian]] childhood of protagonist George Bowling</span>
				<span class='text'>The novel is pessimistic; industrialism and capitalism have killed the best of Old England, and there were great, new external threats</span>
				<span class='text'>In homely terms, Bowling posits the totalitarian hypotheses of Borkenau, Orwell, Silone and Koestler: &quot;Old Hitler's something different</span>
				<span class='text'>So's Joe Stalin</span>
				<span class='text'>They aren't like these chaps in the old days who crucified people and chopped their heads off and so forth, just for the fun of it&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>They're something quite new—something that's never been heard of before&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>==Literary influences===In an autobiographical piece that Orwell sent to the editors of ''Twentieth Century Authors'' in 1940, he wrote: &quot;The writers I care about most and never grow tired of are: [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]], [[Henry Fielding|Fielding]], [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]], [[Charles Reade]], [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]] and, among modern writers, [[James Joyce]], [[T</span>
				<span class='text'>S</span>
				<span class='text'>Eliot]] and [[D</span>
				<span class='text'>H</span>
				<span class='text'>Lawrence]]</span>
				<span class='text'>But I believe the modern writer who has influenced me most is [[Somerset Maugham]], whom I admire immensely for his power of telling a story straightforwardly and without frills</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Elsewhere, Orwell strongly praised the works of [[Jack London]], especially his book ''The Road''</span>
				<span class='text'>Orwell's investigation of poverty in ''The Road to Wigan Pier'' strongly resembles that of Jack London's ''The People of the Abyss'', in which the American journalist disguises himself as an out-of-work sailor to investigate the lives of the poor in London</span>
				<span class='text'>In his essay &quot;Politics vs</span>
				<span class='text'>Literature: An Examination of Gulliver's Travels&quot; (1946) Orwell wrote: &quot;If I had to make a list of six books which were to be preserved when all others were destroyed, I would certainly put ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' among them</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;Other writers admired by Orwell included: [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[George Gissing]], [[Graham Greene]], [[Herman Melville]], [[Henry Miller]], [[Tobias Smollett]], [[Mark Twain]], [[Joseph Conrad]] and [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]]</span>

				<span class='text'>K</span>
				<span class='text'>Chesterton]], whom he regarded as a writer of considerable talent who had chosen to devote himself to &quot;Roman Catholic propaganda&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Notes on Nationalism''&lt;/ref&gt;===Orwell as literary critic===Throughout his life Orwell continually supported himself as a book reviewer, writing works so long and sophisticated they have had an influence on literary criticism</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote in the conclusion to his 1940 essay on [[Charles Dickens]],{{quote|When one reads any strongly individual piece of writing, one has the impression of seeing a face somewhere behind the page</span>
				<span class='text'>It is not necessarily the actual face of the writer</span>
				<span class='text'>I feel this very strongly with [[Jonathon Swift|Swift]], with [[Daniel Defoe|Defoe]], with [[Henry Fielding|Fielding]], [[Stendhal]], [[William Makepeace Thackeray|Thackeray]], [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]], though in several cases I do not know what these people looked like and do not want to know</span>
				<span class='text'>What one sees is the face that the writer ought to have</span>
				<span class='text'>Well, in the case of Dickens I see a face that is not quite the face of Dickens's photographs, though it resembles it</span>
				<span class='text'>It is the face of a man of about forty, with a small beard and a high colour</span>
				<span class='text'>He is laughing, with a touch of anger in his laughter, but no triumph, no malignity</span>
				<span class='text'>It is the face of a man who is always fighting against something, but who fights in the open and is not frightened, the face of a man who is generously angry—in other words, of a nineteenth-century liberal, a free intelligence, a type hated with equal hatred by all the smelly little orthodoxies which are now contending for our souls</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;George Woodcock Introduction to Stephen Wadhams ''Remembering Orwell'' Penguin 1984&lt;/ref&gt;Orwell wrote a critique of [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s play ''[[Arms and the Man#Critical acclaim|Arms and the Man]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>He considered this Shaw's best play and the most likely to remain socially relevant, because of its theme that war is not, generally speaking, a glorious romantic adventure</span>
				<span class='text'>His 1945 essay ''In Defense of P</span>

				<span class='text'>In that essay, Orwell provides six rules for writers:&lt;blockquote&gt;* Never use a [[metaphor]], [[simile]] or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print</span>
				<span class='text'> Never use a long word where a short one will do</span>
				<span class='text'> If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out</span>
				<span class='text'> Never use the [[passive voice|passive]] where you can use the [[active voice|active]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent</span>
				<span class='text'> Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous</span>

				<span class='text'>Crick concentrated on the facts of Orwell's life rather than his character, and presented primarily a political perspective on Orwell's life and work</span>
