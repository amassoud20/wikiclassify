				<span class='text'>if|thumb|Prince Eugene of Savoy]]'''Prince Eugene of Savoy''' ([[French language|French]]: ''François-Eugène de Savoie'', [[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Principe Eugenio di Savoia-Carignano'', [[German language|German]]: ''Prinz Eugen von Savoyen''; 18 October 1663 – 21 April 1736) was a general of the [[Imperial Army (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Army]] and statesman of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and the [[Archduchy of Austria]] and one of the most successful military commanders in modern European history, rising to the highest offices of state at the Imperial court in [[Vienna]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Born in [[Paris]], Eugene grew up around the French court of King [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Based on his poor physique and bearing, the Prince was initially prepared for a career in the church, but by the age of 19 he had determined on a military career</span>
				<span class='text'>Rejected by Louis XIV for service in the French army, Eugene moved to Austria and transferred his loyalty to the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>panning six decades, Eugene served three Holy Roman Emperors: [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]], [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph I]], and [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He first saw action against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] at the [[Battle of Vienna|Siege of Vienna]] in 1683 and the subsequent [[Great Turkish War|War of the Holy League]], before serving in the [[Nine Years' War]], fighting alongside his cousin, the [[Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia|Duke of Savoy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the Prince's fame was secured with his decisive victory against the Ottomans at the [[Battle of Zenta]] in 1697, earning him Europe-wide fame</span>
				<span class='text'>Eugene enhanced his standing during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], where his partnership with the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]] secured victories against the French on the fields of [[Battle of Blenheim|Blenheim]] (1704), [[Battle of Oudenarde|Oudenarde]] (1708), and [[Battle of Malplaquet|Malplaquet]] (1709); he gained further success in the war as Imperial commander in northern Italy, most notably at the [[Battle of Turin]] (1706)</span>
				<span class='text'>Renewed hostilities against the Ottomans in the [[Austro-Turkish War of 1716–18|Austro-Turkish War]] consolidated his reputation, with victories at the battles of [[Battle of Petrovaradin|Petrovaradin]] (1716), and the [[Siege of Belgrade (1717)|decisive encounter]] at [[Belgrade]] (1717)</span>
				<span class='text'>hroughout the late 1720s, Eugene's influence and skilful diplomacy managed to secure the Emperor powerful allies in his dynastic struggles with the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon powers]], but physically and mentally fragile in his later years, Eugene enjoyed less success as commander-in-chief of the army during his final conflict, the [[War of the Polish Succession]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, in Austria, Eugene's reputation remains unrivalled</span>
				<span class='text'>Although opinions differ as to his character, there is no dispute over his great achievements: he helped to save the Habsburg Empire from French conquest; he broke the westward thrust of the Ottomans, liberating central Europe after a century and a half of Turkish occupation; and he was one of the great patrons of the arts whose building legacy can still be seen in Vienna today</span>
				<span class='text'>Eugene died in his sleep at his home on 21 April 1736, aged 72</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;see also [[:fr:Armorial de la maison de Savoie#Branches cadettes|Armorial of the House of Savoy(fr)]]&lt;/ref&gt;]]Prince Eugene was born in the [[Hôtel de Soissons]] in Paris on 18 October 1663</span>
				<span class='text'>His mother, [[Olympia Mancini]], was one of [[Cardinal Mazarin]]'s nieces whom he had brought to [[Paris]] from [[Rome]] in 1647 to further his, and, to a lesser extent, their ambitions</span>
				<span class='text'>The Mancinis were raised at the [[Palais-Royal]] along with the young Louis XIV, with whom Olympia formed an intimate relationship</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet to her great disappointment, her chance to become queen passed by, and in 1657, Olympia married [[Eugene Maurice, Count of Soissons|Eugene Maurice]], [[Count of Soissons]], [[Count of Dreux]] and Prince of [[Savoy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Together they had had five sons (Eugene being the youngest) and three daughters, but neither parent spent much time with the children: his father, a brave, unglamorous French soldier, spent much of his time away campaigning, while Olympia's passion for court intrigue meant the children received little attention from her</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,'' 9–10&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Soisson</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|300px|right|Hôtel de Soissons, Eugene's birthplace</span>
				<span class='text'>Engraving by [[Israel Silvestre]] c</span>
				<span class='text'>1650</span>
				<span class='text'>]The King remained strongly attached to Olympia, so much so that many believed them to be lovers;&lt;ref&gt;Somerset: ''The Affair of the Poisons: Murder, Infanticide and Satanism at the Court of Louis XIV,'' 252&lt;/ref&gt; but her scheming eventually led to her downfall</span>
				<span class='text'>After falling out of favour at court, Olympia turned to [[La Voisin|Catherine Deshayes]] (known as ''La Voisin''), and the arts of black magic and astrology</span>
				<span class='text'>It was a fatal relationship</span>
				<span class='text'>Embroiled in the ''[[Poison affair|affaire des poisons]]'', suspicions now abounded of her involvement in her husband's premature death in 1673, and even implicated her in a plot to kill the King himself</span>
				<span class='text'>Whatever the truth, Olympia, rather than face trial, subsequently fled France for [[Brussels]] in January 1680, leaving Eugene in the care of his father's mother, [[Marie de Bourbon, Countess of Soissons|Marie de Bourbon]], and her daughter, [[Princess Louise Christine of Savoy|Hereditary Princess of Baden]], mother of Prince [[Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden|Louis of Baden]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,'' 9&lt;/ref&gt;From the age of ten, Eugene had been brought up for a career in the church; a personal choice of the King, basing the decision on the young Prince's poor physique and bearing</span>
				<span class='text'>Certainly Eugene's appearance was not impressive — &quot;He was never good-looking …&quot; wrote the [[Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate|Duchess of Orléans]], &quot;It is true that his eyes are not ugly, but his nose ruins his face; he has two large teeth which are visible at all times</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=henderson9&gt;Henderson: ''Prince Eugen of Savoy,'' 9&lt;/ref&gt;In February 1683, to the surprise of his family, Eugene declared his intention of joining the army</span>
				<span class='text'>Now 19 years old, Eugene applied directly to Louis XIV for command of a company in French service, but the King – who had shown no compassion for Olympia's children since her disgrace – refused him out of hand</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;The request was modest, not so the petitioner,&quot; he remarked</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;No one else ever  presumed to stare me out so insolently</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Heer: ''The Holy Roman Empire,'' 228</span>
				<span class='text'>This was a clear infringement of taboo which Louis could not tolerate</span>
				<span class='text'>There is speculation of other reasons</span>
				<span class='text'>[[François-Michel le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois|Louvois]], Louis' Secretary of State for War, detested Eugene's mother after she had rejected a proposed marriage between her daughter and his son</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Denied a military career in France, Eugene decided to seek service abroad</span>
				<span class='text'>One of Eugene's brothers, Louis Julius, had entered Imperial service the previous year, but he had been immediately killed fighting the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in 1683</span>
				<span class='text'>When news of his death reached Paris, Eugene decided to travel to Austria in the hope of taking over his brother's command</span>
				<span class='text'>It was not an unnatural decision: his cousin, Louis of Baden, was already a leading general in the Imperial army, as was a more distant cousin, [[Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria]]</span>
				<span class='text'>On the night of July 26, 1683, Eugene left Paris and headed east</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Heer states Eugene's departure date was 21 July</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Great Turkish War==={{Main|Great Turkish War}}[[File:1684 Entsatz von Wien anagoria</span>
				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|250px|The relief of Vienna on September 12, 1683]]By May 1683, the Ottoman threat to Emperor [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I's]] capital, [[Vienna]], was very real</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Grand Vizier]], [[Kara Mustafa Pasha]] – encouraged by [[Imre Thököly]]'s Magyar rebellion – had invaded [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] with between 100,000–200,000 men;&lt;ref&gt;Childs: ''Warfare in the Seventeenth Century,'' 133</span>
				<span class='text'>Childs puts the number at 100,000; John Wolf, as high as 200,000</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; within two months approximately 90,000 were beneath Vienna's walls</span>
				<span class='text'>With the 'Turks at the gates', the Emperor fled for the safe refuge of [[Passau]] up the [[Danube]], a more distant and secure part of his dominion</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Stoye: ''The Siege of Vienna,'' 114&lt;/ref&gt; It was at Leopold I's camp that Eugene arrived in mid-August</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough Eugene was not of Austrian extraction, he did have [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] antecedents</span>
				<span class='text'>His grandfather, [[Thomas Francis, Prince of Carignano|Thomas Francis]], founder of the Carignano line of the [[House of Savoy]], was the son of [[Infanta Catherine Michelle of Spain|Catherine Michelle]] – a daughter of [[Philip II of Spain]] – and the great-grandson of the Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]</span>
				<span class='text'>But of more immediate consequence to Leopold I was the fact that Eugene was the second cousin of [[Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia|Victor Amadeus]], the Duke of Savoy, a connection that the Emperor hoped might prove useful in any future confrontation with France</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=henderson12&gt;Henderson: ''Prince Eugen of Savoy,'' 12&lt;/ref&gt; These ties, together with his ascetic manner and appearance (a positive advantage to him at the sombre court of Leopold I),&lt;ref&gt;Churchill: ''Marlborough: His Life and Times, Bk</span>
				<span class='text'>1,'' 467&lt;/ref&gt; ensured the refugee from the hated French king a warm welcome at Passau, and a position in Imperial service</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=henderson12/&gt; Though French was his favored language, he communicated with Leopold in Italian, as the Emperor (though he knew it perfectly) disliked French</span>
				<span class='text'>But Eugene also had a reasonable command of German, which he understood very easily, something that helped him much in the military</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''The life of Prince Eugene of Savoy'', Charles de Ligne&lt;/ref&gt;Eugene was in no doubt where his new allegiance lay – &quot;I will devote all my strength, all my courage, and if need be, my last drop of blood, to the service of your Imperial Majesty</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Henderson: ''Prince Eugen of Savoy,'' 13&lt;/ref&gt; This loyalty was immediately put to the test</span>
				<span class='text'>By September, the Imperial forces under the [[Charles V, Duke of Lorraine|Duke of Lorraine]], together with a powerful Polish army under King [[John III Sobieski]], were poised to strike the Sultan's army</span>
				<span class='text'>On the morning of 12 September, the Christian forces drew up in line of battle on the south-eastern slopes of the [[Vienna Woods]], looking down on the massed enemy camp</span>
				<span class='text'>The day-long [[Battle of Vienna]] resulted in the lifting of the 60-day siege, and the Sultan's forces were routed and in retreat</span>
				<span class='text'>Serving under Baden, Eugene distinguished himself in the battle, earning commendation from Lorraine and the Emperor; he later received the nomination for the colonelcy of the Dragoon Regiment Kufstein</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|300px|Recapture of Buda castle in 1686 by [[Gyula Benczúr]]</span>
				<span class='text'>]In March 1684, Leopold I formed the [[Great Turkish War#War of the Holy League (1683–1698)|Holy League]] with [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] to counter the Ottoman threat</span>
				<span class='text'>For the next two years, Eugene continued to perform with distinction on campaign and establish himself as a dedicated, professional soldier; by the end of 1685, still only 22 years old, he was made a Major-General</span>
				<span class='text'>However, little is known of Eugene's life during these early campaigns</span>
				<span class='text'>Contemporary observers make only passing comments of his actions, and his own surviving correspondence, largely to his cousin Victor Amadeus, are typically reticent about his own feelings and experiences</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,'' 22&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it is clear that Baden was impressed with Eugene's qualities – &quot;This young man will, with time, occupy the place of those whom the world regards as great leaders of armies</span>

				<span class='text'>]In June 1686, the Duke of Lorraine [[Battle of Buda (1686)|besieged Buda]] ([[Budapest]]), the centre of the Ottoman occupation in Hungary</span>
				<span class='text'>After resisting for 78 days, the city fell on 2 September, and Turkish resistance collapsed throughout the region as far away as [[Principality of Transylvania (1571–1711)|Transylvania]] and [[Serbia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Further success followed in 1687, where, commanding a cavalry brigade, Eugene made an important contribution to the victory at the [[Battle of Mohács (1687)|Battle of Mohács]] on 12 August</span>
				<span class='text'>Such was the scale of their defeat that the Ottoman army mutinied – a revolt which spread to [[Constantinople]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Grand Vizier, [[Suluieman Pasha]], was executed and Sultan [[Mehmed IV]], deposed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Setton: ''Venice, Austria, and the Turks in the Seventeenth Century,'' 287–89&lt;/ref&gt; Once again, Eugene's courage earned him recognition from his superiors, who granted him the honour of personally conveying the news of victory to the Emperor in Vienna</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;MacMunn: ''Prince Eugene: Twin Marshal with Marlborough,'' 39</span>
				<span class='text'>Leopold responded with a gift of a portrait of himself set in a diamond encrusted frame&lt;/ref&gt; For his services, Eugene was promoted to Lieutenant-General in November 1687</span>
				<span class='text'>He was also gaining wider recognition</span>
				<span class='text'>King [[Charles II of Spain]] bestowed upon him the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]], while his cousin, Victor Amadeus, provided him with money and two profitable abbeys in [[Piedmont]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=mckay27&gt;McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,'' 27&lt;/ref&gt; However, Eugene's military career suffered a temporary setback in 1688 when, on 6 September, the Prince suffered a severe wound to his knee by a musket ball during the [[Siege of Belgrade (1688)|Siege of Belgrade]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It was not until January 1689 that he could return to active service</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=mckay27/&gt;====Interlude in the west: Nine Years' War===={{Main|Nine Years' War}}Just as [[Belgrade]] was falling to Imperial forces under Max Emmanuel in the east, French troops in the west were crossing the [[Rhine]] into the [[Holy Roman Empire]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis XIV had hoped that a show of force would lead to a quick resolution to his dynastic and territorial disputes with the princes of the Empire along his eastern border, but his intimidatory moves only strengthened German resolve, and in May 1689, Leopold I and the Dutch signed an offensive compact aimed at repelling French aggression</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lynn: ''The Wars of Louis XIV, 1667–1714,'' 192–93&lt;/ref&gt;The [[Nine Years' War]] was professionally and personally frustrating for the Prince</span>
				<span class='text'>Initially fighting on the Rhine with Max Emmanuel – receiving a slight head wound at the Siege of Mainz in 1689 – Eugene subsequently transferred himself to Piedmont after Victor Amadeus joined the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|Alliance]] against France in 1690</span>
				<span class='text'>Promoted to general of cavalry, he arrived in [[Turin]] with his friend the [[Charles, Prince of Commercy|Prince of Commercy]]; but it proved an inauspicious start</span>
				<span class='text'>Against Eugene's advice, Amadeus insisted on engaging the French [[Battle of Staffarda|at Staffarda]] and suffered a serious defeat – only Eugene's handling of the Savoyard cavalry in retreat saved his cousin from disaster</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,'' 33&lt;/ref&gt; Eugene remained unimpressed with the men and their commanders throughout the war in Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;The enemy would long ago have been beaten,&quot; he wrote to Vienna, &quot;if everyone had done their duty</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Henderson: ''Prince Eugen of Savoy,'' 32&lt;/ref&gt; So contemptuous was he of the Imperial commander, [[Count Antonio Caraffa|Count Caraffa]], he threatened to leave Imperial service</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Henderson: ''Prince Eugen of Savoy,'' 33&lt;/ref&gt;In Vienna, Eugene's attitude was dismissed as the arrogance of a young upstart, but so impressed was the Emperor by his passion for the Imperial cause, he promoted him to Field-Marshal in 1693</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Henderson: ''Prince Eugen of Savoy,'' 34</span>
				<span class='text'>His promotion, however, had as much to do with the lack of good Imperial commanders as much as Eugene's proven ability thus far</span>
				<span class='text'>There were more than 20 other Field-Marshals in Imperial service at that time</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; When Caraffa's replacement, [[Aeneas de Caprara|Count Caprara]], was himself transferred in 1694, it seemed that Eugene's chance for command and decisive action had finally arrived</span>
				<span class='text'>But Amadeus, doubtful of victory and now more fearful of Habsburg influence in Italy than he was of French, had begun secret dealings with Louis XIV aimed at extricating himself from the war</span>
				<span class='text'>By 1696, the deal was done, and Amadeus transferred his troops and his loyalty to the enemy</span>
				<span class='text'>Eugene was never to fully trust his cousin again; although he continued to pay due reverence to the Duke as head of his family, their relationship would forever after remain strained</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=mckay37&gt;McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,'' 37&lt;/ref&gt;Military honours in Italy undoubtedly belonged to the French commander [[Nicolas Catinat|Marshal Catinat]], but Eugene, the one Allied general determined on action and decisive results, did well to emerge from the Nine Years' War with an enhanced reputation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=mckay37/&gt; With the signing of the [[Treaty of Ryswick]] in September/October 1697, the desultory war in the west was finally brought to an inconclusive end, and Leopold I could once again devote all his martial energies into defeating the Ottoman Turks in the east</span>
				<span class='text'>===Zenta====[[File:Battle of Zenta</span>

				<span class='text'>]The distractions of the war against Louis XIV had enabled the Turks to [[Siege of Belgrade (1690)|recapture Belgrade in 1690]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In August 1691, the Austrians, under Louis of Baden, regained the advantage by heavily defeating the Turks at the [[Battle of Slankamen]] on the Danube, securing Habsburg possession of Hungary and Transylvania</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Setton: ''Venice, Austria, and the Turks in the Seventeenth Century,'' 390&lt;/ref&gt; However, when Baden was transferred west to fight the French in 1692, his successors, first Caprara, then from 1696, [[Augustus II the Strong|Frederick Augustus]], the Elector of Saxony, proved incapable of delivering the final blow</span>
				<span class='text'>On the advice of the President of the Imperial War Council, [[Ernst Rüdiger von Starhemberg|Rüdiger Starhemberg]], Eugene was offered supreme command of Imperial forces in April 1697</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Spielman: ''Leopold I of Austria,'' 165</span>
				<span class='text'>Augustus II left for [[Kraków]] to contest the election for the Polish throne, vacant since the death of John III Sobieski the previous year</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This was Eugene's first truly independent command – no longer need he suffer under the excessively cautious generalship of Caprara and Caraffa, or be thwarted by the deviations of Victor Amadeus</span>
				<span class='text'>But on joining his army, he found it in a state of 'indescribable misery'</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,'' 43&lt;/ref&gt; Confident and self-assured, the Prince of Savoy (ably assisted by Commercy and [[Guido Starhemberg]]) set about restoring order and discipline</span>

				<span class='text'>It was late in the day before the Imperial army struck</span>
				<span class='text'>The Turkish cavalry had already crossed the river so Eugene decided to attack immediately, arranging his men in a half-moon formation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Coxe: ''History of the House of Austria,'' II, 455–56&lt;/ref&gt; The vigour of the assault wrought terror and confusion amongst the Turks, and by nightfall, the battle was won</span>
				<span class='text'>For the loss of some 2,000 dead and wounded, Eugene had inflicted approximately 25,000 casualties on his enemy – including the Grand Vizier, [[Elmas Mehmed Pasha]] – annihilating the Turkish army</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Setton: ''Venice, Austria, and the Turks in the Seventeenth Century,'' 401–02</span>
				<span class='text'>Eugene lost 401 men and 28 officers killed, and 133 officers and 1,435 men were wounded</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Although the Ottomans lacked western organisation and training, the Savoyard prince had revealed his tactical skill, his capacity for bold decision, and his ability to inspire his men to excel in battle against a dangerous foe</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,''  46&lt;/ref&gt; His victory at Zenta had turned him into a European hero, and with victory came reward</span>
				<span class='text'>Land in Hungary, given him by the Emperor, yielded a good income, enabling the Prince to cultivate his newly acquired tastes in art and architecture (see below); but for all his new-found wealth and property, he was, nevertheless, without personal ties or family commitments</span>
				<span class='text'>Of his four brothers, only one was still alive at this time</span>
				<span class='text'>His fourth brother, Emmanuel, had died aged 14 in 1676; his third, Louis Julius (already mentioned) had died on active service in 1683, and his second brother, Philippe, died of smallpox in 1693</span>
				<span class='text'>Eugene's remaining brother, [[Louis Thomas, Count of Soissons|Louis Thomas]] – ostracised for incurring the displeasure of Louis XIV – travelled Europe in search of a career, before arriving in Vienna in 1699</span>
				<span class='text'>With Eugene's help, Louis found employment in the Imperial army, only to be killed in action against the French in 1702</span>
				<span class='text'>Of Eugene's sisters, the youngest had died in childhood</span>
				<span class='text'>The other two, Marie Jeanne-Baptiste and Louise Philiberte, led dissolute lives</span>
				<span class='text'>Expelled from France, Marie joined her mother in Brussels, before eloping with a renegade priest to [[Geneva]], living with him unhappily until her premature death in 1705</span>
				<span class='text'>Of Louise, little is known after her early salacious life in Paris, but in due course, she lived for a time in a convent in Savoy before her death in 1726</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Henderson: ''Prince Eugen of Savoy,''  50–51&lt;/ref&gt;The Battle of Zenta proved to be the decisive victory in the long war against the Turks</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Coxe: ''History of the House of Austria,'' II, 483&lt;/ref&gt; But as so often throughout his career the Prince faced war on two fronts – the enemy in the field and the government in Vienna</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Henderson: ''Prince Eugen of Savoy,'' 67&lt;/ref&gt; Starved of supplies, money and men, Eugene was forced into unconventional means against the vastly superior enemy</span>
				<span class='text'>During a daring [[Battle of Cremona|raid on Cremona]] on the night of 31 January/1 February 1702 Eugene captured the French commander-in-chief</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet the coup was less successful than hoped: Cremona remained in French hands, and the [[Louis Joseph, Duke of Vendôme|Duke of Vendôme]], whose talents far exceeded Villeroi's, became the theatre's new commander</span>
				<span class='text'>Villeroi's capture caused a sensation in Europe, and had a galvanising effect on English public opinion</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;The surprise at Cremona,&quot; wrote the diarist [[John Evelyn]], &quot;… was the greate discourse of this weeke&quot;; but appeals for succour from Vienna remained unheeded, forcing Eugene to seek battle and gain a 'lucky hitt'</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,'' 64&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting [[Battle of Luzzara]] on 15 August proved inconclusive</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Eugene's forces inflicted double the number of casualties on the French the battle settled little except to deter Vendôme trying an all-out assault on Imperial forces that year, enabling Eugene to hold on south of the Alps</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lynn: ''The Wars of Louis XIV, 1667–1714,'' 276&lt;/ref&gt; With his army rotting away, and personally grieving for his long standing friend Prince Commercy who had died at Luzzara, Eugene returned to Vienna in January 1703</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,'' 66</span>
				<span class='text'>Eugene was in no doubt the blame lay with Leopold and his ministry, namely Henry Mansfeld and Gotthard Salaburg</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Austria itself was now facing the direct threat of invasion from across the border in [[Bavaria]] where the state's Elector, Maximilian Emanuel, had declared for the Bourbons in August the previous year</span>
				<span class='text'>Meanwhile, in Hungary a small-scale revolt had broken out in May and was fast gaining momentum</span>
				<span class='text'>With the monarchy at the point of complete financial breakdown Leopold I was at last persuaded to change the government</span>
				<span class='text'>At the end of June 1703 [[Gundaker Starhemberg]] replaced Gotthard Salaburg as President of the Treasury, and Prince Eugene succeeded Henry Mansfeld as the new President of the Imperial [[War Council (Austria)|War Council]] (''Hofkriegsratspräsident'')</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Spielman: ''Leopold I of Austria,'' 189&lt;/ref&gt;As head of the war council Eugene was now part of the Emperor's inner circle, and the first president since [[Raimondo Montecuccoli|Montecuccoli]] to remain an active commander</span>
				<span class='text'>Immediate steps were taken to improve efficiency within the army: encouragement and, where possible, money, was sent to the commanders in the field; promotion and honours were distributed according to service rather than influence; and discipline improved</span>
				<span class='text'>But the Austrian monarchy faced severe peril on several fronts in 1703: by June the [[Claude Louis Hector de Villars|Duke of Villars]] had reinforced the Elector of Bavaria on the Danube thus posing a direct threat to Vienna, while Vendôme remained at the head of a large army in northern Italy opposing Guido Starhemberg's weak Imperial force</span>
				<span class='text'>Of equal alarm was [[Francis II Rákóczi]]'s revolt which, by the end of the year, had reached as far as [[Moravia]] and [[Lower Austria]]</span>

				<span class='text'>124&lt;/ref&gt; The Imperial ambassador in London, [[John Wenceslau Wratislaw von Mitrowitz|Count Wratislaw]], had pressed for Anglo-Dutch assistance on the Danube as early as February 1703, but the crisis in southern Europe seemed remote from the [[Court of St</span>

				<span class='text'>125&lt;/ref&gt; Only a handful of statesmen in England or the Dutch Republic realised the true implications of Austria's peril; foremost amongst these was the English Captain-General, the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'' p</span>
				<span class='text'>126&lt;/ref&gt;By early 1704 Marlborough had resolved to march south and rescue the situation in southern Germany and on the Danube, personally requesting the presence of Eugene on campaign so as to have &quot;a supporter of his zeal and experience&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Churchill: ''Marlborough: His Life and Times, Bk</span>
				<span class='text'>1''  vol II, p</span>
				<span class='text'>731&lt;/ref&gt; The Allied commanders met for the first time at the small village of [[Mundelsheim]] on 10 June, and immediately formed a close rapport – the two men becoming, in the words of [[Thomas Lediard]], 'Twin constellations in glory'</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lediard: ''The Life of John, Duke of Marlborough,'' I, 199&lt;/ref&gt; This professional and personal bond ensured mutual support on the battlefield, enabling many successes during the Spanish Succession war</span>
				<span class='text'>The first of these victories, and the most celebrated, came on 13 August 1704 at the [[Battle of Blenheim]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Eugene commanded the right wing of the Allied army, holding the Elector of Bavaria's and [[Ferdinand de Marsin|Marshal Marsin]]'s superior forces, while Marlborough broke through the [[Camille d'Hostun, duc de Tallard|Marshal Tallard]]'s center, inflicting over 30,000 casualties</span>
				<span class='text'>The battle proved decisive: Vienna was saved and Bavaria was knocked out of the war</span>
				<span class='text'>Both Allied commanders were full of praise for each other's performance</span>
				<span class='text'>Eugene's holding operation, and his pressure for action leading up to the battle, proved crucial for the Allied success</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy'' p</span>
				<span class='text'>87&lt;/ref&gt;In Europe Blenheim is regarded as much a victory for Eugene as it is for Marlborough, a sentiment echoed by Sir [[Winston Churchill]] (Marlborough's descendant and biographer), who pays tribute to &quot;the glory of Prince Eugene, whose fire and spirit had exhorted the wonderful exertions of his troops</span>

				<span class='text'>1'' vol II, p</span>
				<span class='text'>865&lt;/ref&gt; France now faced the real danger of invasion, but Leopold I in Vienna was still under severe strain: Rákóczi's revolt was a major threat; and Guido Starhemberg and Victor Amadeus (who had once again switched loyalties and rejoined the Grand Alliance in 1703) had been unable to halt the French under Vendôme in northern Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>Only Amadeus' capital, [[Turin]], held on</span>
				<span class='text'>===Turin and Toulon====Eugene returned to Italy in April 1705, but his attempts to move west towards Turin were thwarted by Vendôme's skilful manoeuvres</span>
				<span class='text'>Lacking boats and bridging materials, and with desertion and sickness rife within his army, the outnumbered Imperial commander was helpless</span>
				<span class='text'>Leopold I's assurances of money and men had proved illusory, but desperate appeals from Amadeus and criticism from Vienna goaded the Prince into action, resulting in the Imperialists' bloody defeat at the [[Battle of Cassano (1705)|Battle of Cassano]] on 16 August</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Coxe: ''History of the House of Austria,'' III, 15&lt;/ref&gt;  However, following Leopold I's death and the accession of [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph I]] to the Imperial throne in May 1705, Eugene at last began to receive the personal backing he desired</span>
				<span class='text'>Joseph I proved to be a strong supporter of Eugene's supremacy in military affairs; he was the most effective emperor the Prince served and the one he was happiest under</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,'' 94&lt;/ref&gt; Promising support, Joseph I persuaded Eugene to return to Italy and restore Habsburg honour</span>

				<span class='text'>Vendôme now prepared to defend the lines along the river [[Adige]], determined to keep Eugene cooped to the east while the [[Louis d'Aubusson de la Feuillade|Marquis of La Feuillade]] threatened Turin</span>
				<span class='text'>However, feigning attacks along the Adige, Eugene descended south across the river [[Po River|Po]] in mid-July, outmanoeuvring the French commander and gaining a favourable position from which he could at last move west towards Piedmont and relieve Savoy's capital</span>

				<span class='text'>]Events elsewhere were now to have major consequences for the war in Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>With Villeroi's crushing defeat by Marlborough at the [[Battle of Ramillies]] on 23 May, Louis XIV recalled Vendôme north to take command of French forces in Flanders</span>
				<span class='text'>It was a transfer that [[Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]] considered something of a deliverance for the French commander who was &quot;now beginning to feel the unlikelihood of success [in Italy] … for Prince Eugene, with the reinforcements&lt;ref&gt;The Duke of Marlborough had supplied Eugene with 10,000 reinforcements, as well as a loan of £250,000</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; that had joined him after the Battle of Calcinato, had entirely changed the outlook in that theatre of the war</span>

				<span class='text'>''Memoirs'', 303&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Duke of Orléans]], under the direction of Marsin, replaced Vendôme, but indecision and disorder in the French camp led to their undoing</span>
				<span class='text'>After uniting his forces with Victor Amadeus at [[Villastellone]] in early September, Eugene attacked, overwhelmed, and decisively defeated the French forces [[Battle of Turin|besieging Turin]] on 7 September</span>
				<span class='text'>Eugene's success broke the French hold on northern Italy, and the whole Po valley fell under Allied control</span>
				<span class='text'>Eugene had gained a victory as signal as his colleague had at Ramillies – &quot;It is impossible for me to express the joy it has given me;&quot; wrote Marlborough, &quot;for I not only esteem but I really love the prince</span>
				<span class='text'>This glorious action must bring France so low, that if our friends could but be persuaded to carry on the war with vigour one year longer, we cannot fail, with the blessing of God, to have such a peace as will give us quiet for all our days</span>

				<span class='text'>2,'' III, 182</span>
				<span class='text'>Eugene took little interest in Milan: he never returned after 1707</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The Imperial victory in Italy marked the beginning of Austrian rule in Lombardy, and earned Eugene the Governorship of [[Duchy of Milan|Milan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>But the following year was to prove a disappointment for the Prince and the Grand Alliance as a whole</span>
				<span class='text'>The Emperor and Eugene (whose main goal after Turin was to take [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]] and [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]] from Philip duc d'Anjou's supporters), reluctantly agreed to Marlborough's plan for an [[Battle of Toulon (1707)|attack on Toulon]] – the seat of French naval power in the Mediterranean</span>
				<span class='text'>However, disunion between the Allied commanders – Victor Amadeus, Eugene, and the English Admiral [[Cloudesley Shovell|Shovell]] – doomed the Toulon enterprise to failure</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Eugene favoured some sort of attack on France's south-eastern border it was clear he felt the expedition impractical, and had shown none of the &quot;alacrity which he had displayed on other occasions</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Coxe: ''History of the House of Austria,'' III, 28&lt;/ref&gt; Substantial French reinforcements finally brought an end to the venture, and on 22 August 1707 the Imperial army began its retirement</span>
				<span class='text'>The subsequent capture of [[Susa (Italy)|Susa]] could not compensate for the total collapse of the Toulon expedition and with it any hope of an Allied war-winning blow that year</span>

				<span class='text'>]At the beginning of 1708 Eugene successfully evaded calls for him to take charge in Spain (in the end Guido Starhemberg was sent), thus enabling him to take command of the Imperial army on the [[Moselle (river)|Moselle]] and once again unite with Marlborough in the Spanish Netherlands</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Eugene's army was made up almost entirely of Germans paid for by Britain and the Dutch Republic</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Eugene (without his army) arrived at the Allied camp at Assche, west of Brussels, in early July, providing a welcome boost to morale after the early defection of [[Bruges]] and [[Ghent]] to the French</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot; … our affairs improved through God's support and Eugene's aid,&quot; wrote the Prussian General [[Dubislav Gneomar von Natzmer|Natzmer]], &quot;whose timely arrival raised the spirits of the army again and consoled us</span>

				<span class='text'>It was also at this time that Eugene visited his mortally ill mother in Brussels for the last time</span>
				<span class='text'>She died later that year in 1708</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Heartened by the Prince's confidence the Allied commanders devised a bold plan to engage the French army under Vendôme and the [[Louis, Duke of Burgundy (1682–1712)|Duke of Burgundy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>On 10 July the Anglo-Dutch army made a forced march to surprise the French, reaching the river [[Scheldt]] just as the enemy were crossing to the north</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Battle of Oudenarde|ensuing battle]] on 11 July – more a contact action rather than a set-piece engagement – ended in a resounding success for the Allies, aided by the dissension of the two French commanders</span>

				<span class='text'>Eugene became Allied commander-in-chief following Marlborough's dismissal in 1711</span>
				<span class='text'>]Marlborough now favoured a bold advance along the coast to bypass the major French fortresses, followed by a march on Paris</span>
				<span class='text'>But fearful of unprotected supply-lines, the Dutch and Eugene favoured a more cautious approach</span>
				<span class='text'>Marlborough acquiesced and resolved upon the siege of [[Vauban]]'s great fortress, [[Siege of Lille (1708)|Lille]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=chandler224&gt;Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' 224&lt;/ref&gt; While the Duke commanded the covering force, Eugene oversaw the siege of the town which surrendered on 22 October; however, it was not until 10 December that the resolute [[Louis François, duc de Boufflers|Marshal Boufflers]] yielded the [[citadel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet for all the difficulties of the siege (Eugene was badly wounded above his left eye by a musket ball, and even survived an attempt to poison him), the campaign of 1708 had been a remarkable success</span>
				<span class='text'>The French were driven out of almost all the Spanish Netherlands</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt;The recent defeats, together with the severe winter of 1708–09, had caused extreme famine and privation in France</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis XIV was close to accepting Allied terms, but the conditions demanded by the leading Allied negotiators, [[Anthonie Heinsius]], [[Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend|Charles Townshend]], Marlborough, and Eugene – principally that Louis XIV should use his own troops to force Philip V off the Spanish throne – proved unacceptable to the French</span>
				<span class='text'>Neither Eugene nor Marlborough had objected to the Allied demands at the time, but neither wanted the war with France to continue, and would have preferred further talks to deal with the Spanish issue</span>
				<span class='text'>But the French King offered no further proposals</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,'' 121&lt;/ref&gt; Lamenting the collapse of the negotiations, and aware of the vagaries of war, Eugene wrote to the Emperor in mid-June 1709</span>

				<span class='text'>Coxe says the citadel fell on 4 September</span>
				<span class='text'>Chandler describes the siege as one of the hardest fought and least pleasant of modern history</span>
				<span class='text'>This time, Marlborough conducted the siege while Eugene commanded the covering force</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; the Allied generals turned their attention towards [[Mons]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Marshal Villars, recently joined by Boufflers, moved his army south-west of the town and began to fortify his position</span>
				<span class='text'>Marlborough and Eugene favoured an engagement before Villars could render his position impregnable; but they also agreed to wait for reinforcements from Tournai which did not arrive until the following night, thus giving the French further opportunity to prepare their defences</span>
				<span class='text'>Notwithstanding the difficulties of the attack, however, the Allied generals did not shrink from their original determination</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Coxe: ''History of the House of Austria, '' III, 58&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent [[Battle of Malplaquet]], fought on 11 September 1709, was the bloodiest engagement of the war</span>
				<span class='text'>On the left flank, the [[John William Friso, Prince of Orange|Prince of Orange]] led his Dutch infantry in desperate charges only to have it cut to pieces; on the other flank, Eugene attacked and suffered almost as severely</span>
				<span class='text'>But sustained pressure on his extremities forced Villars to weaken his centre, thus enabling Marlborough to breakthrough and claim victory</span>
				<span class='text'>Villars was unable to save Mons, which subsequently capitulated on 21 October, but his resolute defence at Malplaquet – inflicting up to 25% casualties on the Allies – may have saved France from destruction</span>

				<span class='text'>Eugene and Marlborough could not be accused of wrecking the negotiations, but neither showed regret at the breakdown of the talks</span>
				<span class='text'>There was no alternative but to continue the war, and in June the Allied commanders captured [[Douai]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This success was followed by a series of minor sieges, and by the close of 1710 the Allies had cleared much of France's protective ring of fortresses</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet there had been no final, decisive breakthrough, and this was to be the last year that Eugene and Marlborough would work together</span>

				<span class='text'>]Following the death of  Joseph I on 17 April 1711 his brother, [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles]], the pretender to the Spanish throne, became emperor</span>
				<span class='text'>In England the new [[Tory (British political party)|Tory]] government (the 'peace party' who had deposed the Whigs in October 1710) declared their unwillingness to see Charles VI become Emperor as well as King of Spain, and had already begun secret negotiations with the French</span>
				<span class='text'>In January 1712 Eugene arrived in England hoping to divert the government away from its peace policy, but despite the social success the visit  was a political failure: [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] and her ministers remained determined to end the war regardless of the Allies</span>
				<span class='text'>Eugene had also arrived too late to save Marlborough who, seen by the Tories as the main obstacle to peace, had already been dismissed on charges of embezzlement</span>
				<span class='text'>Elsewhere, however, the Austrians had made some progress – the Hungarian revolt had finally came to end</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Eugene would have preferred to crush the rebels the Emperor had offered lenient conditions, leading to the signing of the [[Treaty of Szatmár]] on 30 April 1711</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lynn gives the signing date as 1 May&lt;/ref&gt;Hoping to influence public opinion in England and force the French into making substantial concessions, Eugene prepared for a major campaign</span>
				<span class='text'>However, on 21 May 1712 – when the Tories felt they had secured favourable terms with their unilateral talks with the French – the [[James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde|Duke of Ormonde]] (Marlborough's successor) received the so-called 'restraining orders', forbidding him to take part in any military action</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wolf: ''The Emergence of the Great Powers: 1685–1715'', 89</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the Tory ministers did not inform Eugene of the restraining orders, they did inform Marshal Villars</span>
				<span class='text'>In October 1712 the Tory government even communicated to the French what they knew of Eugene's war plans</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Eugene took the fortress of [[Le Quesnoy]] in early July, before besieging [[Landrecies]], but Villars, taking advantage of Allied disunity, outmanoeuvred Eugene and defeated the [[Arnold van Keppel, 1st Earl of Albemarle|Earl of Albermarle]]'s Dutch garrison at [[Battle of Denain|Denain]] on 24 July</span>
				<span class='text'>The French followed the victory by seizing the Allies' main supply magazine at [[Marchiennes]], before reversing their earlier losses at [[Douai]], Le Quesnoy and [[Bouchain]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In one summer the whole forward Allied position laboriously built up over the years to act as the springboard into France had been precipitously abandoned</span>

				<span class='text'>His position was built on his military successes, but his actual power was expressed through his role as president of the war council, and as ''de facto'' president of the conference which dealt with foreign policy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,'' 154&lt;/ref&gt; In this position of influence Eugene took the lead in pressing Charles VI towards peace</span>
				<span class='text'>The government had come to accept that further war in the Netherlands or Spain was impossible without the aid of the Maritime Powers; yet the Emperor, still hoping that somehow he could place himself on the throne in Spain, refused to make peace at the [[Treaty of Utrecht|Utrecht conference]] along with the other Allies</span>
				<span class='text'>Reluctantly, Eugene prepared for another campaign, but lacking troops, finance, and supplies his prospects in 1713 were poor</span>
				<span class='text'>Villars, with superior numbers, was able to keep Eugene guessing as to his true intent</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=lynn357&gt;Lynn: ''The Wars of Louis XIV, 1667–1714,'' 357&lt;/ref&gt; Eugene was reluctant to carry on the war, and wrote to the Emperor in June that a bad peace would be better than being 'ruined equally by friend and foe'</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,'' 145&lt;/ref&gt; With Austrian finances exhausted and the German states reluctant to continue the war, Charles VI was compelled to enter into negotiations</span>
				<span class='text'>Eugene and Villars (who had been old friends since the Turkish campaigns of the 1680s) initiated talks on 26 November</span>
				<span class='text'>Eugene proved an astute and determined negotiator, and gained favourable terms by the [[Treaty of Rastatt]] signed on 7 March 1714 and the [[Treaty of Baden (1714)|Treaty of Baden]] signed on 7 September 1714</span>

				<span class='text'>Artist: Jacob van Schuppen</span>
				<span class='text'>]Eugene's main reason for desiring peace in the west was the growing danger posed by the Turks in the east</span>
				<span class='text'>Turkish military ambitions had revived after 1711 when they had mauled [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]]'s army on the river [[Prut]]h: in December 1714 Sultan [[Ahmed III]]'s forces attacked the Venetians in the [[Morea]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Coxe: ''History of the House of Austria,'' III, 100&lt;/ref&gt; To Vienna it was clear that the Turks intended to attack Hungary and undo the whole Karlowitz settlement of 1699</span>
				<span class='text'>After the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] rejected an offer of mediation in April 1716, Charles VI despatched Eugene to Hungary to lead his relatively small but professional army</span>
				<span class='text'>Of all Eugene's wars this was the one in which he exercised most direct control; it was also a war which, for the most part, Austria fought and won on her own</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,'' 159–60&lt;/ref&gt; Eugene left Vienna in early June 1716 with a field army of between 80,000–90,000 men</span>
				<span class='text'>By early August 1716 the Ottoman Turks, some 200,000 men under the sultan's son-in-law, the Grand Vizier [[Silahdar Damat Ali Pasha|Damat Ali Pasha]], were marching from Belgrade towards Eugene's position west of the fortress of [[Petrovaradin]] on the north bank of the Danube</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=setton435&gt;Setton: ''Venice, Austria, and the Turks in the Seventeenth Century,'' 435&lt;/ref&gt; The Grand Vizier had intended to seize the fortress; but Eugene gave him no chance to do so</span>
				<span class='text'>After resisting calls for caution and forgoing a council of war, the Prince decided to [[Battle of Petrovaradin|attack immediately]] on the morning of 5 August with approximately 70,000 men</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Setton: ''Venice, Austria, and the Turks in the Seventeenth Century,'' 435; McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy'', 161&lt;/ref&gt; The Turkish [[Janissary|janissaries]] had some initial success, but after an Imperial cavalry attack on their flank, Ali Pasha's forces fell into confusion</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the Imperials lost almost 5,000 dead or wounded, the Turks, who retreated in disorder to Belgrade, seem to have lost double that amount, including the Grand Vizier himself who had entered the mêlée and subsequently died of his wounds</span>

				<span class='text'>Artist: [[Johann Gottfried Auerbach]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The battle was Eugene's last great victory</span>
				<span class='text'>]Eugene proceeded to take the [[Banat]] fortress of [[Timișoara|Temeswar]] in mid-October 1716 (thus ending 164 years of Turkish rule), before turning his attention to the next campaign and to what he considered the main goal of the war – Belgrade</span>
				<span class='text'>Situated at the confluence of the Rivers Danube and [[Sava]], Belgrade held a garrison of 30,000 men under Mustapha Pasha</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Setton: ''Venice, Austria, and the Turks in the Seventeenth Century,'' 438–39&lt;/ref&gt; Imperial troops besieged the place in mid-June 1717, and by the end of July large parts of the city had been destroyed by artillery fire</span>
				<span class='text'>By the first days of August, however, a huge Turkish field army (150,000–200,000 strong), under the new Grand Vizier, Halil Pasha, had arrived on the plateau east of the city to relieve the garrison</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Coxe: ''History of the House of Austria,'' III, 102&lt;/ref&gt; News spread through Europe of Eugene's imminent destruction; but he had no intention of lifting the siege</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,'' 165&lt;/ref&gt; With his men suffering from [[dysentery]], and continuous bombardment from the plateau, Eugene, aware that a decisive victory alone could extricate his army, decided to attack the relief force</span>
				<span class='text'>On the morning of 16 August 40,000 Imperial troops marched through the fog, caught the Turks unawares, and routed Halil Pasha's army; a week later Belgrade surrendered, effectively bringing an end to the war</span>
				<span class='text'>The victory was the crowning point of Eugene's military career and had confirmed him as the leading European general</span>
				<span class='text'>His ability to snatch victory at the moment of defeat had shown the Prince at his best</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,'' 166&lt;/ref&gt;The principal objectives of the war had been achieved: the task Eugene had begun at Zenta was complete, and the Karlowitz settlement secured</span>
				<span class='text'>By the terms of  the [[Treaty of Passarowitz]], signed on 21 July 1718, the Turks surrendered the [[Banat of Temeswar]], along with Belgrade and most of Serbia, although they regained the Morea from the Venetians</span>
				<span class='text'>The war had dispelled the immediate Turkish threat to Hungary, and was a triumph for the Empire and for Eugene personally</span>

				<span class='text'>Eugene served Emperor Charles VI for the last 25 years of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>]While Eugene fought the Turks in the east, unresolved issues following the Utrecht/Rastatt settlements led to hostilities between the Emperor and Philip V of Spain in the west</span>
				<span class='text'>Charles VI had refused to recognise Philip V as King of Spain, a title which he himself claimed; in return, Philip V had refused to renounce his claims to Naples, Milan, and the Netherlands, all of which had transferred to the House of Austria following the Spanish Succession war</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip V was roused by his influential wife, [[Elisabeth Farnese]], daughter of the [[Odoardo Farnese, Hereditary Prince of Parma|Hereditary Prince of Parma]], who personally held dynastic claims in the name of her son, [[Charles III of Spain|Don Charles]], to the duchies of [[Tuscany]], [[Province of Parma|Parma]] and [[Province of Piacenza|Piacenza]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Coxe: ''History of the House of Austria,'' III, 106&lt;/ref&gt; Representatives from a newly formed [[Triple Alliance (1717)|Anglo-French alliance]] – who were desirous of European peace for their own dynastic securities and trade opportunities – called on both parties to recognise each other's sovereignty</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet Philip V remained intractable, and on 22 August 1717 his chief minister, [[Giulio Alberoni|Alberoni]], effected the invasion of Austrian [[Sardinia]] in what seemed like the beginning of the reconquest of Spain's former Italian empire</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=mckay170&gt;McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,'' 170&lt;/ref&gt;Eugene returned to Vienna from his recent victory at Belgrade (before the conclusion of the Turkish war) determined to prevent an escalation of the conflict, complaining that, &quot;two wars cannot be waged with one army&quot;;&lt;ref name=mckay170/&gt; only reluctantly did the Prince release some troops from the Balkans for the Italian campaign</span>
				<span class='text'>Rejecting all diplomatic overtures Philip V unleashed another assault in June 1718, this time against Savoyard [[Sicily]] as a preliminary to attacking the Italian mainland</span>
				<span class='text'>Realising that only the [[Royal Navy|British fleet]] could prevent further Spanish landings, and that pro-Spanish groups in France might push the [[regent]], [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Duke of Orléans]], into war against Austria, Charles VI had no option but to sign the [[War of the Quadruple Alliance|Quadruple Alliance]] on 2 August 1718, and formally renounce his claim to Spain</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Coxe: ''History of the House of Austria, '' III, 108&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the Spanish fleet's destruction off [[Battle of Cape Passaro|Cape Passaro]], Philip V and Elisabeth remained resolute, and rejected the treaty</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough Eugene could have gone south after the conclusion of the Turkish war, he chose instead to conduct operations from Vienna; but Austria's military effort in Sicily proved derisory, and Eugene's chosen commanders, [[Johann Hieronymus Freiherr von und Zum Jungen|Zum Jungen]], and later [[Count Claude Florimond de Mercy|Count Mercy]], performed poorly</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,'' 172</span>
				<span class='text'>Isolated Spanish troops held on around [[Palermo]] till the end of 1719, while no expedition could even be attempted on Sardinia</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; It was only from pressure exerted by the French army advancing into the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque]] provinces of northern Spain in April 1719, and the British Navy's attacks on the Spanish fleet and shipping, that compelled Philip V and Elisabeth to dismiss Alberoni and join the Quadruple Alliance on 25 January 1720</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, the Spanish attacks had strained Charles VI's government, causing tension between the Emperor and his Spanish Council&lt;ref&gt;The Spanish Council consisted of Spaniards and Italians who had followed Charles VI from Spain after the Spanish Succession war</span>
				<span class='text'>The most senior member of the council and an implacable enemy of Eugene was the Archbishop of Valencia, [[Antonio Folch de Cardona]]; but the most important members were [[Count Rocco Stella|Count Stella]] and the [[Marquis Ramon de Rialp]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The council controlled Charles VI's lands in Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; on the one hand, and the conference, headed by Eugene, on the other</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite Charles VI's own personal ambitions in the Mediterranean it was clear to the Emperor that Eugene had put the safeguarding of his conquests in Hungary before everything else, and that military failure in Sicily also had to rest on Eugene</span>
				<span class='text'>Consequently, the Prince's influence over the Emperor declined considerably</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,'' 177&lt;/ref&gt;==Later life (1721–36)=====Governor-General of the Southern Netherlands===Eugene had become governor of the [[Southern Netherlands]] – then the [[Austrian Netherlands]] – in June 1716, but he was an absent ruler, directing policy from Vienna through his chosen representative the [[Hercule-Louis Turinetti, marquis of Prié|Marquis of Prié]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,'' 180</span>
				<span class='text'>Eugene was reluctant to leave his palaces and friends: it would probably have meant his resignation from his chief interest, the war council</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; De Prié proved unpopular with the local population and the guilds who, following the [[Barrier Treaty]] of 1715, were obliged to meet the financial demands of the administration and the Dutch barrier garrisons; with Eugene's backing and encouragement civil disturbances in Antwerp and Brussels were forcibly suppressed</span>
				<span class='text'>After displeasing the Emperor over his initial opposition to the formation of the [[Ostend Company]], de Prié also lost the support of the native nobility from within his own council of state in Brussels, particularly from the [[Jean-Philippe-Eugène de Mérode-Westerloo|Marquis de Mérode-Westerloo]]</span>
				<span class='text'>One of Eugene's former favourites, [[Claude Alexandre de Bonneval|General Bonneval]], also joined the nobles in opposition to de Prié, further undermining the Prince</span>
				<span class='text'>When de Prié's position became untenable Eugene felt compelled to resign his post as governor on 16 November 1724</span>
				<span class='text'>As compensation Charles VI conferred on him the honorary position as [[vicar-general]] of Italy, worth 140,000 gulden a year, and an estate at [[Siebenbrunn]] in [[Lower Austria]] said to be worth double that amount</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,'' 186</span>
				<span class='text'>De Prié stood down in the spring of 1725 to avoid dismissal</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; But his resignation distressed him, and to compound his concerns Eugene caught a severe bout of [[influenza]] that Christmas, marking the beginning of permanent [[bronchitis]] and acute infections every winter for the remaining twelve years of his life</span>

				<span class='text'>]The 1720s saw rapidly changing alliances between the European powers and almost constant diplomatic confrontation, largely over unsolved issues regarding the Quadruple Alliance</span>
				<span class='text'>The Emperor and the Spanish King continued to use each other's titles, and Charles VI still refused to remove the remaining legal obstacles to Don Charles' eventual succession to the duchies of Parma and Tuscany</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet in a surprise move Spain and Austria moved closer with the signing of the [[Treaty of Vienna (1725)|Treaty of Vienna]] in April/May 1725</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Philip V and Elisabeth approached Austria to exploit Charles VI's isolation, and his differences with the Maritime Powers over the Ostend Company</span>
				<span class='text'>They intended to conclude marriage alliances for their two sons to the Emperor's daughters, aiming to bring their children control of Habsburg hereditary lands and most of Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In response Britain, France, and Prussia joined together in the [[Treaty of Hanover (1725)|Alliance of Hanover]] to counter the danger to Europe of an Austro-Spanish hegemony</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hatton: ''George I,'' 274–75: Sweden, Denmark, and the Dutch Republic signed the Treaty of Hanover in 1727</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; For the next three years there was the continual threat of war between the Hanover Treaty powers and the Austro-Spanish bloc</span>
				<span class='text'>rom 1726 Eugene gradually began to regain his political influence</span>
				<span class='text'>With his many contacts throughout Europe Eugene, backed by Gundaker Starhemberg and Count [[Frederick Charles, count von Schönborn|Schönborn]], the Imperial vice-chancellor, managed to secure powerful allies and strengthen the Emperor's position – his skill in managing the vast secret diplomatic network over the coming years was the main reason why Charles VI once again came to depend upon him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,'' 213&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1726 Russia acceded to the Austro-Spanish alliance, and in October [[Frederick William I of Prussia|Frederick William]] of Prussia followed suit by defecting from the Allies with the signing of a mutual defensive treaty with the Emperor</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Coxe: ''History of the House of Austria,'' III, 139</span>
				<span class='text'>The Allies failed to support Frederick William's claims to [[Duchy of Jülich|Jülich-Berg]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Despite the conclusion of the brief [[Anglo-Spanish War (1727)|Anglo-Spanish conflict]], war between the European powers persisted throughout 1727–28</span>
				<span class='text'>However, in 1729 Elisabeth Farnese abandoned the Austro-Spanish alliance</span>
				<span class='text'>Realizing that Charles VI could not be drawn into the marriage pact she wanted, Elisabeth concluded that the best way to secure her son's succession to Parma and Tuscany now lay with Britain and France</span>
				<span class='text'>To Eugene it was 'an event that which is seldom to be found in history'</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=mckay219&gt;McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,'' 219&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Prince's determined lead to resist all pressure, Charles VI sent troops into Italy to prevent the entry of Spanish garrisons into the contested duchies</span>

				<span class='text'>]Eugene took command on the Rhine in April 1734, but vastly outnumbered he was forced onto the defensive</span>
				<span class='text'>In June Eugene set out to relieve [[Philippsburg]], yet his former drive and energy was now gone</span>
				<span class='text'>Accompanying Eugene was a young [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]], sent by his father to learn the art of war</span>
				<span class='text'>Frederick gained considerable knowledge from Eugene, recalling in later life his great debt to his Austrian mentor, but the Prussian prince was aghast at Eugene's condition, writing later, &quot;his body was still there but his soul had gone</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,'' 239&lt;/ref&gt; Eugene conducted another cautious campaign in 1735, once again pursuing a sensible defensive strategy on limited resources; but his short-term memory was by now practically non-existent, and his political influence disappeared completely – [[Gundaker Thomas Starhemberg|Gundaker Starhemberg]] and [[Johann Christoph von Bartenstein]] now dominated the conference in his place</span>
				<span class='text'>However, fortunately for Charles VI Fleury was determined to limit the scope of the war, and in October 1735 he granted generous peace preliminaries to the Emperor</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,'' 240&lt;/ref&gt;===Private life and death===Despite being one of the richest and most celebrated men of his age, Eugene never married and the suggestion is that he was predominantly [[homosexual]]</span>
				<span class='text'>History knows little of his life before 1683</span>
				<span class='text'>In his early boyhood in Paris &quot;he belonged to a small, effeminate set that included such unabashed perverts as the young [[abbé de Choisy]] who was invariably dressed as a girl&quot; wrote the English historian Nicholas Henderson</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Henderson, ''Eugen of Savoy'', London, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate|Duchess of Orléans]], who had known Eugene from those days, would later write to her aunt, Princess Sophia of Hanover, describing Eugene's antics with lackeys and pages</span>
				<span class='text'>He was &quot;a vulgar whore&quot; along with the Prince of Turenne, and &quot;often played the woman with young people&quot; with the nickname of 'Madame Simone' or 'Madam l'Ancienne'</span>
				<span class='text'>He preferred a &quot;couple of fine page boys&quot; to any woman, and was refused an ecclesiastical benefice due to his &quot;depravity&quot;&lt;ref name=henderson9/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Ludwig Holland (ed), ''Briefe der Herzogin Elisabeth Charlotte von Orleans'', Stuttgart, 1867&lt;/ref&gt; Eugene's behaviour may have been a result of his mother's lax household and her own failure to show any affection towards him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,'' 10&lt;/ref&gt;Of related interest is a popular soldier's song which parodied an imaginary voyage by Eugene and the marquis de la Moussaye on the [[Rhine]]</span>
				<span class='text'>A storm breaks and the general fears the worst, but the Marquis consoles him: &quot;Our lives are safe/ For we are sodomites/ Destined to perish only by fire/ We shall land</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; A comment made by [[Johann Matthias von der Schulenburg]] in 1709, who had served under Eugene, could be read that the prince enjoyed &quot;la petite débauche et la p[ine] au-delà de tout,&quot; or that he derived his sexual gratification from the virile member of others</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Curt Riess, Auch Du, Casar, ''Homosexualitat als Schicksal'', Munich: Universitas, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;During the last 20 years of his life Eugene was particularly close to Countess Eleonora Batthyány, daughter of Count [[Theodor von Strattman]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;There was one reference to another woman before Batthyány</span>
				<span class='text'>The Swedish minister in Vienna makes reference to Countess Maria Thürheim</span>
				<span class='text'>There is, however, no evidence for or against this suggestion</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Much about their acquaintance remains speculative (Eugene never mentions her in any of his surviving letters), and there is certainly no suggestion of a sexual relationship, but although they lived apart most foreign diplomats regarded Eleonora as his &quot;official lover&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Eugene and Eleonora were constant companions, meeting for dinner, receptions and card games almost every day till his death</span>
				<span class='text'>But their surviving correspondence does not indicate any real intimacy in the relationship</span>
				<span class='text'>Eugene's other friends such as the papal [[nuncio]], [[Domenico Silvio Passionei|Passionei]], made up for the family he still lacked</span>
				<span class='text'>or his only surviving nephew, Emmanuel, the son of his brother Louis Thomas, Eugene arranged a marriage with one of the daughters of Prince Liechenstein, but Emmanuel died of smallpox in 1729</span>
				<span class='text'>With the death of Emmanuel's son in 1734, no close male relatives remained to succeed the Prince</span>
				<span class='text'>His closest relative, therefore, was Louis Thomas's unmarried daughter, [[Princess Maria Anna Victoria of Savoy]], whom Eugene had never met and, as he had heard nothing but bad of her, made no effort to do so</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,'' 203&lt;/ref&gt;Eugene returned to Vienna from the War of the Polish Succession in October 1735, weak and feeble; when Maria Theresa and Francis Stephen married in February 1736 Eugene was too ill to attend</span>
				<span class='text'>After playing cards at Countess Batthyány's on the evening of 20 April he returned to his bed at the [[Winter Palace of Prince Eugene|Stadtpalais]]</span>
				<span class='text'>When his servants arrived to wake him the next morning, 21 April 1736, they found Prince Eugene dead after choking from phlegm in his throat, presumably after suffering from [[pneumonia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Eugene's heart was buried with those of others of his family in Turin</span>
				<span class='text'>His remains were carried in a long procession to [[St</span>
				<span class='text'>Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna|St</span>
				<span class='text'>Stephen's Cathedral]], where the body was interred in the ''Kreuzkapelle''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=mckay243&gt;McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,'' 243&lt;/ref&gt;Countess Batthyány expressed in a letter dated 23 December 1720, that at the ''Kreuzkapelle'' a solemn requiem would be held annually</span>
				<span class='text'>She dedicated for this purpose two thousand guilders</span>

				<span class='text'>]Eugene's rewards for his victories, his share of booty, his revenues from his abbeys in Savoy, and a steady income from his Imperial offices and governorships, enabled him to contribute to the landscape of [[baroque]] architecture</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,'' 189</span>
				<span class='text'>Eugene's presidency of the Imperial War Council was probably worth 100,000 [[Guilder|gulden]] a year, while his governorships of Milan and the Netherlands were likely to have brought in 150,000 gulden annually</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Eugene spent most of his life in Vienna at his Winter Palace, the [[Winter Palace of Prince Eugene|Stadtpalais]], built by [[Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach|Fischer von Erlach]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The palace acted as his official residence and home, but for reasons that remain speculative the Prince's association with Fischer ended before the building was complete, favouring instead [[Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt]] as his chief architect</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;There is no indication of a quarrel with Erlach, just a desired change in style</span>
				<span class='text'>Hildebrandt had accompanied Eugene in Italy as his siege engineer in 1695–96 and made Imperial court engineer in 1701</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Eugene first employed Hildebrandt to finish the Stadtpalais before commissioning him to  prepare plans for a palace ([[Savoy Castle]]) on his Danubian island at [[Ráckeve]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Began in 1701 the single-story building took twenty years to complete; yet, probably because of the [[Rákóczi's War of Independence|Rákóczi revolt]], the Prince seems to have visited it only once – after the [[Siege of Belgrade (1717)|siege of Belgrade]] in 1717</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,'' 193&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Upper belvedere</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|left|thumb|300px|Upper Belvedere, Vienna</span>
				<span class='text'>]Of more importance was the grandiose complex of the two [[Belvedere (palace)|Belvedere]] palaces in Vienna</span>
				<span class='text'>The single-storey Lower Belvedere, with its exotic gardens and zoo, was completed in 1716</span>
				<span class='text'>The Upper Belvedere, completed between 1720 and 1722, is a more substantial building; with sparkling white stucco walls and copper roof it became a wonder of Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>Eugene and Hildebrandt also converted an existing structure on his Marchfeld estate into a country seat, the [[Schloss Hof|Schlosshof]], situated between the Rivers Danube and [[Morava River|Morava]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Eugene had purchased this land in 1726</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The building, completed in 1729, was far less elaborate than his other projects but it was strong enough to serve as a fortress in case of need</span>
				<span class='text'>Eugene spent much of his spare time there in his last years accommodating large hunting parties</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,'' 195</span>
				<span class='text'>Maria Theresa brought the Schlosshof in 1755</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In the years following the Peace of Rastatt Eugene became acquainted with a large number of scholarly men</span>
				<span class='text'>Given his position and responsiveness they were keen to meet him: few could exist without patronage and this was probably the main reason for [[Gottfried Leibniz]]'s association with him in 1714</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,'' 199</span>
				<span class='text'>The leading German philosopher got to know the Prince during his visit to Vienna in 1714, trying to persuade Charles VI to found an Academy of Science</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Eugene also befriended the French writer [[Jean-Baptiste Rousseau]] who, by 1716, was receiving financial support from Eugene</span>
				<span class='text'>Rousseau stayed on attached to the Prince's household, probably helping in the library, until he left for the Netherlands in 1722</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Rousseau had not been long in the Netherlands before he joined the conspiracy to remove Eugene from the post of Governor General</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Another acquaintance, [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], already famous for his ''[[Persian Letters]]'' when he arrived in Vienna in 1728, favourably recalled his time spent at the Prince's table</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, Eugene had no literary pretensions of his own, and was not tempted like [[Maurice de Saxe]] or Marshal Villars to write his memoirs or books on the art of war</span>
				<span class='text'>He did, however, become a collector on the grandest scale: his picture galleries were filled with 16th- and 17th-century Italian, Dutch and Flemish art;&lt;ref&gt;Henderson: ''Prince Eugen of Savoy,'' 256</span>
				<span class='text'>Amongst the list of artists who worked for Eugene was the Italian, [[Giuseppe Crespi|Giuseppe Maria Crespi]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; his library at the Stadtpalais crammed with over 15,000 books, 237 manuscripts as well as a huge collection of prints (of particular interest were books on natural history and geography)</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;It is hardly believable,&quot; wrote Rousseau, &quot;that a man who carries on his shoulders the burden of almost all the affairs of Europe … should find as much time to read as though he had nothing else to do</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Henderson: ''Prince Eugen of Savoy,'' 259&lt;/ref&gt; At Eugene's death his possessions and estates, except those in Hungary which the crown reclaimed, went to his niece, Princess Maria Anna Victoria, who at once decided to sell everything</span>
				<span class='text'>The artwork was bought by [[Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Eugene's library, prints and drawings were purchased by the Emperor in 1737 and have since passed into Austrian national collections</span>

				<span class='text'>][[Napoleon]] considered Eugene one of the seven greatest commanders of history</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Henderson, ''Prince Eugen of Savoy,'' xi</span>
				<span class='text'>The others were [[Alexander the Great]], [[Hannibal]], [[Julius Caesar]], [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus Aldolphus]], [[Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne|Turenne]], and [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Although later military critics have disagreed with that assessment, Eugene was undoubtedly the greatest Austrian general</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=mckay246&gt;McKay, ''Prince Eugene of Savoy'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>246–247&lt;/ref&gt; He was no military innovator, but he had the ability to make an inadequate system work</span>
				<span class='text'>He was equally adept as an organizer, strategist, and tactician, believing in the primacy of battle and his ability to seize the opportune moment to launch a successful attack</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=mckay246/&gt; &quot;The important thing,&quot; wrote Maurice de Saxe in his ''Reveries'', &quot;is to see the opportunity and to know how to use it</span>
				<span class='text'>Prince Eugene possessed this quality which is the greatest in the art of war and which is the test of the most elevated genius</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;De Saxe, Maurice</span>
				<span class='text'>''Reveries on the Art of War'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>119&lt;/ref&gt; This fluidity was key to his battlefield successes in Italy and in his wars against the Turks</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, in the Low Countries, particularly after the battle of Oudenarde in 1708, Eugene, like his cousin Louis of Baden, tended to play safe and become bogged down in a conservative strategy of sieges and defending supply lines</span>
				<span class='text'>After the attempt on Toulon in 1707, he also became very wary of combined land/sea operations</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=chandler224/&gt; To historian Derek McKay, however, the main criticism of him as a general is his legacy – he left no school of officers nor an army able to function without him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=mckay246/&gt;[[File:Budapest princ Eugen 2</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|170px|left|Eugene's statue, [[Buda Castle]], Budapest, Hungary</span>
				<span class='text'>]Eugene was a disciplinarian – when ordinary soldiers disobeyed orders he was prepared to shoot them himself – but he rejected blind brutality, writing &quot;you should only be harsh when, as often happens, kindness proves useless&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=mckay228&gt;McKay, ''Prince Eugene of Savoy'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>228–232&lt;/ref&gt; On the battlefield Eugene demanded courage in his subordinates, and expected his men to fight where and when he wanted; his criteria for promotion were based primarily on obedience to orders and courage on the battlefield rather than social position</span>
				<span class='text'>On the whole his men responded because he was willing to push himself as hard as them</span>
				<span class='text'>However, his position as President of the Imperial War Council proved less successful</span>
				<span class='text'>Following the long period of peace after the Austro-Turkish War, the idea of creating a separate field army or providing garrison troops with effective training for them to be turned into such an army quickly was never considered by Eugene</span>
				<span class='text'>By the time of the War of the Polish Succession, therefore, the Austrians were outclassed by a better prepared French force</span>
				<span class='text'>For this Eugene was largely to blame – in his view (unlike the drilling and manoeuvres carried out by the Prussians which to Eugene seemed irrelevant to real warfare) the time to create actual fighting men was when war came</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=mckay228/&gt; But although Frederick the Great had been struck by the muddle of the Austrian army and its poor organisation during the Polish Succession war, he later amended his initial harsh judgements</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;If I understand anything of my trade,&quot; commented Frederick in 1758, &quot;especially in the more difficult aspects, I owe that advantage to Prince Eugene</span>
				<span class='text'>From him I learnt to hold grand objectives constantly in view, and direct all my resources to those ends</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=duffy17&gt;Duffy, ''Frederick the Great: A Military Life'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>17&lt;/ref&gt; To historian [[Christopher Duffy]] it was this awareness of the 'grand strategy' that was Eugene's legacy to Frederick</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=duffy17/&gt;To his responsibilities Eugene attached his own personal values – physical courage, loyalty to his sovereign, honesty, self-control in all things – and he expected these qualities from his commanders</span>
				<span class='text'>Eugene's approach was dictatorial, but he was willing to co-operate with someone he regarded as his equal, such as Baden or Marlborough</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet the contrast to his co-commander of the Spanish Succession war were stark</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Marlborough,&quot; wrote Churchill, &quot;was the model husband and father, concerned with building up a home, founding a family, and gathering a fortune to sustain it&quot;; whereas Eugene, the bachelor, was &quot;disdainful of money, content with his bright sword and his lifelong animosities against Louis XIV</span>
