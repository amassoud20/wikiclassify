				<span class='text'>vg}}'''Otto Eduard Leopold, Prince of Bismarck, Duke of Lauenburg''' (1 April 1815&amp;nbsp;– 30 July 1898), known as '''Otto von Bismarck''', was a conservative [[Prussia]]n statesman who dominated German and European affairs from the 1860s until 1890</span>
				<span class='text'>In the 1860s he engineered a series of wars that [[Unification of Germany|unified the German states]] (excluding [[Austria]]) into a powerful [[German Empire]] under Prussian leadership</span>
				<span class='text'>With that accomplished by 1871 he skillfully used [[balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]] diplomacy to preserve German [[hegemony]] in a Europe which, despite many disputes and war scares, remained at peace</span>
				<span class='text'>For historian [[Eric Hobsbawm]], it was Bismarck who &quot;remained undisputed world champion at the game of multilateral diplomatic chess for almost twenty years after 1871, [and] devoted himself exclusively, and successfully, to maintaining peace between the powers</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hobsbawm]], ''The Age of Empire: 1875–1914'' (1987), p</span>
				<span class='text'>312</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In 1862, King [[Wilhelm I]] appointed Bismarck as [[Minister President of Prussia]], a position he would hold until 1890 (except for a short break in 1873)</span>
				<span class='text'>He provoked three short, decisive wars against [[Second Schleswig War|Denmark]], [[Austro-Prussian War|Austria]], and [[Franco-Prussian War|France]], aligning the smaller German states behind Prussia in defeating his arch-enemy France</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1871 he formed the German Empire with himself as [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]], while retaining control of Prussia</span>
				<span class='text'>His diplomacy of ''[[realpolitik]]'' and powerful rule at home gained him the nickname the &quot;Iron Chancellor</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; German unification and its rapid economic growth was the foundation to his foreign policy</span>
				<span class='text'>He disliked colonialism but reluctantly built an [[German colonial empire|overseas empire]] when it was demanded by both elite and mass opinion</span>
				<span class='text'>Juggling a very complex interlocking series of conferences, negotiations and alliances, he used his diplomatic skills to maintain Germany's position and used the balance of power to keep Europe at peace in the 1870s and 1880s</span>
				<span class='text'>e was a master of complex politics at home</span>
				<span class='text'>He created the first [[welfare state]] in the modern world, with the goal of gaining working class support that might otherwise go to his Socialist enemies</span>
				<span class='text'>In the 1870s he allied himself with the Liberals (who were low-tariff and anti-Catholic) and fought the Catholic Church in what was called the ''[[Kulturkampf]]'' (&quot;culture war&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>He lost that battle as the Catholics responded by forming a powerful Centre party and using universal male suffrage to gain a [[Voting bloc|bloc]] of seats</span>
				<span class='text'>Bismarck then reversed himself, ended the ''Kulturkampf'', broke with the Liberals, imposed protective [[tariffs]], and formed a political alliance with the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]] to fight the [[Socialists]]</span>
				<span class='text'>A devout Lutheran, he was loyal to his king, who argued with Bismarck but in the end supported him against the advice of his wife and his heir</span>
				<span class='text'>While the ''[[Reichstag]]'', Germany's parliament, was elected by universal male suffrage, it did not have much control of government policy</span>
				<span class='text'>Bismarck distrusted democracy and ruled through a strong, well-trained bureaucracy with power in the hands of a traditional [[Junker]] elite that comprised the landed nobility</span>
				<span class='text'>Under Wilhelm I, Bismarck largely controlled domestic and foreign affairs, until he was removed by young Kaiser [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] in 1890, at the age of 75</span>
				<span class='text'>ismarck, a Junker himself, was strong-willed, outspoken and sometimes overbearing, but he could also be polite, charming and witty</span>
				<span class='text'>Occasionally he displayed a violent temper, and he kept his power by melodramatically threatening resignation time and again, which frightened Wilhelm I</span>
				<span class='text'>He possessed not only a long-term national and international vision but also the short-term ability to juggle complex developments</span>
				<span class='text'>As the leader of what historians call &quot;[[revolutionary conservatism]],&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| authorlink=Isabel V</span>

				<span class='text'>Many historians praise him as a visionary who was instrumental in uniting Germany and, once that had been done, kept the peace in Europe through adroit diplomacy</span>
				<span class='text'> recent biographer of Bismarck wrote that he was &lt;blockquote&gt;a political genius of a very unusual kind [whose success] rested on several sets of conflicting characteristics among which brutal, disarming honesty mingled with the wiles and deceits of a [[confidence man]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He played his parts with perfect self-confidence, yet mixed them with rage, anxiety, illness, hypochrondria, and irrationality</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>He used democracy when it suited him, negotiated with revolutionaries and the dangerous [[Ferdinand Lassalle]], the socialist who might have contested his authority</span>
				<span class='text'> He utterly dominated his cabinet ministers with a sovereign contempt and blackened their reputations as soon as he no longer needed them</span>
				<span class='text'> He outwitted the parliamentary parties, even the strongest of them, and betrayed all those </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>who had put him into power</span>
				<span class='text'> By 1870 even his closest friends </span>

				<span class='text'>pg|upright|thumb|Bismarck at 21, 1836]]Bismarck was born in [[Schönhausen]], a wealthy family estate situated west of Berlin in the Prussian [[province of Saxony]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His father, Karl Wilhelm ''Ferdinand'' von Bismarck (1771–1845), was a [[Junker]] estate owner and a former Prussian military officer; his mother, Wilhelmine Luise Mencken (1789–1839), was the well-educated daughter of a senior government official in Berlin</span>
				<span class='text'>He had two siblings, Bernhard Von Bismarck (1810–1893) and Malwine Von Bismarck (1827–1908)</span>
				<span class='text'>The world saw Bismarck as a typical Prussian Junker, an image that he encouraged by wearing military uniforms</span>
				<span class='text'>Bismarck was well educated and cosmopolitan with a gift for conversation</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition to his native German, he was fluent in English, French, Italian, Polish and Russian</span>

				<span class='text'>From 1832 to 1833 he studied law at the [[University of Göttingen]], where he was a member of the [[Corps Hannovera Göttingen|Corps Hannovera]], and then enrolled at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] (1833–35)</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1838, while stationed as an army reservist in [[Greifswald]], he studied agriculture at the [[University of Greifswald]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Steinberg/&gt; At Göttingen, Bismarck became friends with the American student [[John Lothrop Motley]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Motley, who later became an eminent historian and diplomat while remaining close to Bismarck, wrote a novel in 1839, ''Morton's Hope, or the Memoirs of a Provincial'', about life in a German university</span>
				<span class='text'>In it he described Bismarck as a reckless and dashing eccentric, but also as an extremely gifted and charming young man</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, 2011, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>39–41</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Although Bismarck hoped to become a diplomat, he started his practical training as a lawyer in [[Aachen]] and [[Potsdam]], and soon resigned, having first placed his career in jeopardy by taking unauthorized leave to pursue two English girls, first Laura Russell, niece of [[William Vane, 1st Duke of Cleveland|the Duke of Cleveland]], and then Isabella Loraine-Smith, daughter of a wealthy clergyman</span>
				<span class='text'>He also served in the army for a year and became an officer in the [[Landwehr]] (reserve), before returning to run the family estates at Schönhausen on his mother's death in his mid-twenties</span>
				<span class='text'>round age 30 Bismarck had an intense friendship with Marie von Thadden, newly married to one of his friends</span>
				<span class='text'>Under her influence, Bismarck became a [[Pietism|Pietist]] Lutheran, and later recorded that at Marie's deathbed (from typhoid) he prayed for the first time since his childhood</span>
				<span class='text'>Bismarck married Marie's cousin, the noblewoman [[Johanna von Puttkamer]] (1824–94) at Alt-Kolziglow (modern [[Kołczygłowy]]) on 28 July 1847</span>
				<span class='text'>Their long and happy marriage produced three children, [[Herbert von Bismarck|Herbert]] (b</span>
				<span class='text'>1849), [[Wilhelm von Bismarck|Wilhelm]] (b</span>
				<span class='text'>1852) and Marie (b</span>
				<span class='text'>1847)</span>
				<span class='text'>Johanna was a shy, retiring and deeply religious woman—although famed for her sharp tongue in later life—and in his public life, Bismarck was sometimes accompanied by his sister Malwine &quot;Malle&quot; von Arnim</span>
				<span class='text'>Bismarck soon adopted his wife's pietism, and he remained a devout Pietist Lutheran for the rest of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>=Early political career==[[File:BismarckLandtag</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|187px|Bismarck at age 32, 1847]]In 1847 Bismarck, aged 32, was chosen as a representative to the newly created Prussian legislature, the {{ill|de|Vereinigter Landtag|Vereinigter Landtag|''Vereinigter Landtag''}}</span>
				<span class='text'>There, he gained a reputation as a royalist and reactionary politician with a gift for stinging rhetoric; he openly advocated the idea that the monarch had a [[Divine right of kings|divine right to rule]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His selection was arranged by the Gerlach brothers, fellow Pietist Lutherans whose ultra-conservative faction was known as the &quot;Kreuzzeitung&quot; after their newspaper, the ''[[Neue Preussische Zeitung]]'', which was so nicknamed because it featured an Iron Cross on its cover</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, 2011, p</span>
				<span class='text'>93</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn | Pflanze | 1971 | p = 56}}In March 1848, [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Prussia faced a revolution]] (one of the [[revolutions of 1848]] across Europe), which completely overwhelmed King [[Frederick William IV]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The monarch, though initially inclined to use armed forces to suppress the rebellion, ultimately declined to leave Berlin for the safety of military headquarters at Potsdam</span>
				<span class='text'>Bismarck later recorded that there had been a &quot;rattling of sabres in their scabbards&quot; from Prussian officers when they learned that the King would not suppress the revolution by force</span>
				<span class='text'>He offered numerous concessions to the liberals: he wore the black-red-and-gold revolutionary colours (as seen on the flag of today's Germany), promised to promulgate a constitution, agreed that Prussia and other German states should merge into a single [[nation-state]], and appointed a liberal, [[Ludolf Camphausen]], as [[Minister President of Prussia|Minister President]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, 2011, p</span>
				<span class='text'>89</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Bismarck had at first tried to rouse the peasants of his estate into an army to march on Berlin in the King's name</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, 2011, p</span>
				<span class='text'>86</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He travelled to Berlin in disguise to offer his services, but was instead told to make himself useful by arranging food supplies for the Army from his estates in case they were needed</span>
				<span class='text'>The King's brother, Prince [[Wilhelm I|Wilhelm]], had fled to England, and Bismarck intrigued with Wilhelm's wife [[Augusta of Saxe-Weimar|Augusta]] to place their teenage son [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Frederick William]] on the Prussian throne in Frederick William IV's place</span>
				<span class='text'>Augusta would have none of it, and detested Bismarck thereafter,&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, 2011, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>87–88</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; despite the fact that he later helped restore a working relationship between the King and his brother Wilhelm</span>
				<span class='text'>Bismarck was not yet a member of the ''Landtag'', the lower house of the [[Landtag of Prussia|new Prussian legislature]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The liberal movement perished by the end of 1848 amid internal fighting</span>
				<span class='text'> Meanwhile, the conservatives regrouped, formed an inner group of advisers—including the Gerlach brothers, known as the &quot;[[Camarilla]]&quot;—around the King, and retook control of Berlin</span>
				<span class='text'>Although a constitution was granted, its provisions fell far short of the demands of the revolutionaries</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Pflanze|1971|p = 64}}In 1849, Bismarck was elected to the ''Landtag''</span>
				<span class='text'>At this stage in his career, he opposed the [[unification of Germany]], arguing that Prussia would lose its independence in the process</span>
				<span class='text'>He accepted his appointment as one of Prussia's representatives at the Erfurt Parliament, an assembly of German states that met to discuss plans for union, but he only did so to oppose that body's proposals more effectively</span>
				<span class='text'>The parliament failed to bring about unification, for it lacked the support of the two most important German states, Prussia and [[Austrian Empire|Austria]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In September 1850, after a dispute over Hesse, (the Hesse Crisis of 1850&lt;ref&gt;Alan Palmer, ''Bismarck'' [Charles Scribner Publishers: New York, 1976] p</span>
				<span class='text'>41&lt;/ref&gt;) Prussia was humiliated and forced to back down by Austria (supported by Russia) in the so-called [[Punctation of Olmütz]];&lt;ref&gt;Alan Palmer, ''Bismarck'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>42</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; a plan for the unification of Germany under Prussian leadership, proposed by Prussia's Minister President Radowitz, was also abandoned</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1851, Frederick William IV appointed Bismarck as Prussia's envoy to the [[diet (assembly)|Diet of the German Confederation in Frankfurt]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Bismarck gave up his elected seat in the ''Landtag'', but was appointed to the [[Prussian House of Lords]] a few years later</span>
				<span class='text'>In Frankfurt he engaged in a battle of wills with the Austrian representative Count Friedrich von [[Thun und Hohenstein]], insisting on being treated as an equal by petty tactics such as imitating Thun when Thun claimed the privileges of smoking and removing his jacket in meetings</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, 2011, p</span>
				<span class='text'>117</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This episode was the background for an altercation in the Frankfurt chamber with [[Georg von Vincke]] that led to a [[duel]] between Bismarck and Vincke and [[Karl von Bodelschwingh-Velmede|Carl von Bodelschwingh]] as impartial party, which ended without injury</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, 2011, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>142–43</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Bismarck's eight years in Frankfurt were marked by changes in his political opinions, detailed in the numerous lengthy memoranda, which he sent to his ministerial superiors in Berlin</span>
				<span class='text'>No longer under the influence of his ultraconservative Prussian friends, Bismarck became less reactionary and more pragmatic</span>
				<span class='text'>He became convinced that to countervail Austria's newly restored influence, Prussia would have to ally herself with other German states</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, he grew to be more accepting of the notion of a united German nation</span>
				<span class='text'>He gradually came to believe that he and his fellow conservatives had to take the lead in the drive toward creating a unified nation in order to keep from being eclipsed</span>
				<span class='text'>He also believed that the middle-class liberals wanted a unified Germany more than they wanted to break the grip of the traditional forces over society</span>
				<span class='text'>ismarck also worked to maintain the friendship of Russia and a working relationship with [[Napoleon III]]'s France—the latter being anathema to his conservative friends, the Gerlachs,&lt;ref&gt;Quotations from letters between Leopold von Gerlach and Bismarck debating the topic of Napoleon III are in Steinberg, 2011, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>131–33</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; but necessary both to threaten Austria and to prevent France allying itself to Russia</span>
				<span class='text'>In a famous letter to Leopold von Gerlach, Bismarck wrote that it was foolish to play chess having first put 16 of the 64 squares out of bounds</span>
				<span class='text'>This observation became ironic, as after 1871, France indeed became [[French–German enmity|Germany's permanent enemy]], and eventually allied with Russia against Germany in the 1890s</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, 2011, ch</span>
				<span class='text'>5</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Bismarck was alarmed by Prussia's isolation during the [[Crimean War]] of the mid-1850s in which Austria sided with Britain and France against Russia; Prussia was almost not invited to the peace talks in Paris</span>
				<span class='text'>In the Eastern Crisis of the 1870s, fear of a repetition of this turn of events would later be a factor in Bismarck's signing the [[Dual Alliance, 1879|Dual Alliance]] with Austria-Hungary in 1879</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:BismarckRoonMoltke</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|250px|Bismarck with [[Albrecht von Roon|Roon]] (centre) and [[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder|Moltke]] (right), the three leaders of Prussia in the 1860s]]==Ambassador to Russia and France==In October 1857, Frederick William IV suffered a paralysing stroke</span>
				<span class='text'>His brother Wilhelm took over the Prussian government as Regent</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilhelm was initially seen as a moderate ruler, whose friendship with liberal Britain was symbolised by the recent marriage of his son Frederick William to [[Queen Victoria]]'s [[Victoria, Princess Royal|eldest daughter]]; their son would be Wilhelm II, Emperor of Germany in World War I</span>
				<span class='text'>As part of his 'New Course', Wilhelm brought in new ministers, moderate conservatives known as the 'Wochenblatt' after their newspaper</span>
				<span class='text'>he Regent soon replaced Bismarck as envoy in Frankfurt and made him Prussia's ambassador to the Russian Empire</span>
				<span class='text'>In theory, this was a promotion, as Russia was one of Prussia's two most powerful neighbors</span>
				<span class='text'>But Bismarck was sidelined from events in Germany and watched impotently as France drove Austria out of [[Lombardy]] during the [[Second Italian War of Independence|Italian War of 1859]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Bismarck proposed that Prussia should exploit Austria's weakness to move her frontiers &quot;as far south as [[Lake Constance]]&quot; on the Swiss border; instead, Prussia mobilised troops in the Rhineland to deter further French advances into Venetia</span>
				<span class='text'>s a further snub, the Regent, who scorned Bismarck as a &quot;Landwehrleutnant&quot; (reserve lieutenant), had declined to promote him to the rank of major-general, normal for the ambassador to [[St Petersburg]], an important refusal as Prussia and Russia were close military allies, whose heads of state often communicated through military contacts rather than diplomatic channels</span>
				<span class='text'>Bismarck stayed in St Petersburg for four years, during which he almost lost his leg to botched medical treatment and once again met his future adversary, the Russian [[Alexander Gorchakov|Prince Gorchakov]], who had been the Russian representative in Frankfurt in the early 1850s</span>
				<span class='text'>The Regent also appointed [[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder|Helmuth von Moltke]] as the new Chief of Staff of the Prussian Army, and [[Albrecht von Roon]] as Minister of War with the job of reorganizing the army</span>
				<span class='text'>Over the next 12 years, the two and Bismarck transformed Prussia</span>
				<span class='text'>Bismarck later referred to this period as &quot;the most significant of my life&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>espite his lengthy stay abroad, Bismarck was not entirely detached from German domestic affairs</span>
				<span class='text'>He remained well-informed due to his friendship with Roon, with whom Bismarck formed a lasting political alliance</span>
				<span class='text'>In May 1862, he was sent to Paris to serve as ambassador to France, and also visited England that summer</span>
				<span class='text'>These visits enabled him to meet and take the measure of several adversaries: Napoleon III in France, and in Britain, Prime Minister [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Palmerston]], Foreign Secretary [[Lord John Russell|Earl Russell]], and Conservative politician [[Benjamin Disraeli]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Disraeli, who would become Prime Minister in the 1870s, later claimed to have said of Bismarck, &quot;Be careful of that man—he means every word he says&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>The new monarch often came into conflict with the increasingly liberal Prussian Diet (''Landtag'')</span>
				<span class='text'>A crisis arose in 1862, when the Diet refused to authorize funding for a proposed re-organization of the army</span>
				<span class='text'>The King's ministers could not convince legislators to pass the budget, and the King was unwilling to make concessions</span>

				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Eyck | 1964 | pp = 58–68}}Despite the initial distrust of the King and Crown Prince and the loathing of Queen Augusta, Bismarck soon acquired a powerful hold over the King by force of personality and powers of persuasion</span>
				<span class='text'>Bismarck was intent on maintaining royal supremacy by ending the budget deadlock in the King's favour, even if he had to use extralegal means to do so</span>
				<span class='text'>Under the Constitution, the budget could be passed only after the king and legislature agreed on its terms</span>
				<span class='text'>Bismarck contended that since the Constitution did not provide for cases in which legislators failed to approve a budget, there was a &quot;hole&quot; in the Constitution and so he could apply the previous year's budget to keep the government running</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, on the basis of the 1861 budget, tax collection continued for four years</span>

				<span class='text'>Following the [[Alvensleben Convention]] of 1863, the House of Deputies resolved that it could no longer come to terms with Bismarck; in response, the King dissolved the Diet, accusing it of trying to obtain unconstitutional control over the ministry, which, under the Constitution, was responsible solely to the king</span>
				<span class='text'>Bismarck then issued an edict restricting the freedom of the press, an edict that even gained the public opposition of the Crown Prince</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite (or perhaps because of) his attempts to silence critics, Bismarck remained a largely unpopular politician</span>
				<span class='text'>His supporters fared poorly in the elections of October 1863, in which a liberal coalition, whose primary member was the [[German Progress Party|Progress Party]], won over two-thirds of the seats</span>
				<span class='text'>The House made repeated calls for Bismarck to be dismissed, but the King supported him, because he feared that if he did dismiss the Minister President, he would likely be succeeded by a liberal</span>

				<span class='text'>Prussian public opinion strongly favoured Augustenburg's claim, as Holstein and southern Schleswig were and still are mostly German-speaking</span>
				<span class='text'>Bismarck took an unpopular step by insisting that the territories legally belonged to the Danish monarch under the [[London Protocol (1852)|London Protocol]] signed a decade earlier</span>
				<span class='text'>Nonetheless, Bismarck denounced Christian's decision to completely annex Schleswig to Denmark</span>
				<span class='text'>With support from Austria, he issued an ultimatum for Christian IX to return Schleswig to its former status</span>
				<span class='text'>When Denmark refused, Austria and Prussia invaded, commencing the [[Second Schleswig War]] and Denmark was forced to cede both duchies</span>

				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, Prussia won the decisive [[Battle of Königgrätz]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The King and his generals wanted to push onward, conquer Bohemia and march to Vienna, but Bismarck, worried that Prussian military luck might change or that France might intervene on Austria's side, enlisted the help of the Crown Prince, who had opposed the war but had commanded one of the Prussian armies at Königgrätz, to dissuade his father after stormy meetings</span>
				<span class='text'>Bismarck insisted on a &quot;soft peace&quot; with no annexations and no victory parades, so as to be able to quickly restore friendly relations with Austria</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;As a result of the [[Peace of Prague (1866)]], the German Confederation was dissolved</span>
				<span class='text'>Prussia annexed Schleswig, Holstein, [[Frankfurt]], [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]], [[Electorate of Hesse|Hesse-Kassel]], and [[Nassau (state)|Nassau]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Further, Austria promised not to intervene in German affairs</span>
				<span class='text'>To solidify Prussian hegemony, Prussia forced the 21 states north of the [[Main (river)|River Main]] to join it in forming the [[North German Confederation]] in 1867</span>
				<span class='text'>The confederation was governed by a [[North German Constitution|constitution]] largely drafted by Bismarck</span>
				<span class='text'>Executive power was vested in a president, an hereditary office of the kings of Prussia</span>
				<span class='text'>He was assisted by a chancellor responsible only to him</span>
				<span class='text'>As president of the confederation, Wilhelm appointed Bismarck as chancellor of the confederation</span>
				<span class='text'>Legislation was the responsibility of the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]], a popularly elected body, and the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]], an advisory body representing the states</span>
				<span class='text'> The Bundesrat was, in practice, the stronger chamber</span>
				<span class='text'>Bismarck was the dominant figure in the new arrangement; as Foreign Minister of Prussia, he instructed the Prussian deputies to the Bundesrat</span>
				<span class='text'>russia had only a plurality (17 out of 43 seats) in the Bundesrat despite being larger than the other 21 states combined, but Bismarck could easily control the proceedings through alliances with the smaller states</span>
				<span class='text'>This began what historians refer to as &quot;The Misery of Austria&quot; in which Austria served as a mere [[vassal]] to the superior Germany, a relationship that was to shape history until the end of the First World War</span>
				<span class='text'>Bismarck had originally managed to convince smaller states like Saxony, Hesse-Kassel, and Hanover to join Prussia against Austria, after promising them protection from foreign invasion, morale unity[?], and fair commercial laws</span>
				<span class='text'>ismarck, who by now held the rank of major in the Landwehr, wore this uniform during the campaign and was at last promoted to the rank of major-general in the Landwehr cavalry after the war</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he never personally commanded troops in the field, he usually wore a general's uniform in public for the rest of his life, as seen in numerous paintings and photographs</span>
				<span class='text'>He was also given a cash grant by the Prussian Landtag, which he used to buy a country estate in [[Warcino|Varzin]], now part of Poland</span>
				<span class='text'>ilitary success brought Bismarck tremendous political support in Prussia</span>
				<span class='text'>In the House of Deputies elections of 1866, the liberals suffered a major defeat, losing their large majority</span>
				<span class='text'>The new, largely conservative House was on much better terms with Bismarck than previous bodies; at the Minister-President's request, it retroactively approved the budgets of the past four years, which had been implemented without parliamentary consent</span>
				<span class='text'> Bismarck suspected it would split the liberal opposition</span>
				<span class='text'> While some liberals argued that constitutional government was a bright line that should not be crossed, most of them believed it would be a waste of time to oppose the bill, and supported it in hopes of winning more freedom in the future</span>
				<span class='text'>[Jonathan Steinberg]] says of Bismarck's achievements to this point: &lt;blockquote&gt;The scale of Bismarck's triumph cannot be exaggerated</span>
				<span class='text'>He alone had brought about a complete transformation of the European international order</span>
				<span class='text'>He had told those who would listen what he intended to do, how he intended to do it, and he did it</span>
				<span class='text'> He achieved this incredible feat without commanding an army, and without the ability to give an order to the humblest common soldier, without control of a large party, without public support, indeed, in the face of almost universal hostility, without a majority in parliament, without control of his cabinet, and without a loyal following in the bureaucracy</span>
				<span class='text'>He no longer had the support of the powerful conservative interest groups who had helped him achieve power</span>

				<span class='text'></span>

				<span class='text'>Its emperor, [[Napoleon III]], had tried to gain territory for France (in Belgium and [[Left Bank of the Rhine|on the left bank]] of the [[Rhine]]) as a compensation for not joining the war against Prussia and was disappointed by the surprisingly fast decision of the war</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Howard|1991|p=40}} Accordingly, opposition politician [[Adolphe Thiers]] claimed that it was France, not Austria, who had really been defeated at Königgrätz</span>
				<span class='text'>Bismarck, at the same time, did not avoid war with France, though he feared the French for a number of reasons</span>
				<span class='text'>First, he feared that Austria, hungry for revenge, would ally with the French</span>
				<span class='text'>Similarly, he feared that the Russian army would assist France to maintain a balance of power</span>

				<span class='text'>To achieve this he kept Napoleon III involved in various intrigues whereby France might gain territory from Luxembourg or Belgium</span>
				<span class='text'>France never achieved any such gain, but it was made to look greedy and untrustworthy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Eyck 1964, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>139–86&lt;/ref&gt;A suitable pretext for war arose in 1870, when the German Prince [[Leopold, Prince of Hohenzollern|Leopold]] of [[Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen]] was offered the Spanish throne, vacant since a revolution in 1868</span>
				<span class='text'>France pressured Leopold into withdrawing his candidacy</span>
				<span class='text'> Not content with this, Paris demanded that Wilhelm, as head of the House of Hohenzollern, assure that no Hohenzollern would ever seek the Spanish crown again</span>
				<span class='text'>To provoke France into declaring war with Prussia, Bismarck published the [[Ems Dispatch]], a carefully edited version of a conversation between King Wilhelm and the French ambassador to Prussia, [[Vincent, Count Benedetti|Count Benedetti]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This conversation had been edited so that each nation felt that its ambassador had been disrespected and ridiculed, thus inflaming popular sentiment on both sides in favor of war</span>

				<span class='text'>e was forced to contend with French [[revanchism]], the desire to avenge the losses of the Franco-Prussian War</span>
				<span class='text'>Bismarck, therefore, engaged in a policy of diplomatically isolating France while maintaining cordial relations with other nations in Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>He had little interest in naval or colonial entanglements and thus avoided discord with Great Britain</span>
				<span class='text'>Historians emphasize that he wanted no more territorial gains after 1871, and vigorously worked to form cross-linking alliances that prevented any war in Europe from starting</span>

				<span class='text'>Taylor, ''Europe: Grandeur and Decline'' (1967) p 89&lt;/ref&gt;Well aware that Europe was skeptical of his powerful new Reich, Bismarck turned his attention to preserving peace in Europe based on a balance of power that would allow Germany's economy to flourish</span>
				<span class='text'>Bismarck feared that a hostile combination of Austria, France, and Russia would crush Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>If two of them were allied, then the third would ally with Germany only if Germany conceded excessive demands</span>
				<span class='text'>The solution was to ally with two of the three</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1873 he formed the [[League of the Three Emperors]], an alliance of Wilhelm, Czar [[Alexander II of Russia]], and Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Francis Joseph]] of Austria-Hungary</span>
				<span class='text'>Together they would control Eastern Europe, making sure that restive ethnic groups such as the Poles were kept in control</span>

				<span class='text'>Bismarck put heavy pressure on Belgium, Spain, and Italy hoping to obtain the election of liberal, anticlerical governments</span>
				<span class='text'>His plan was to promote [[republicanism]] in France by isolating the clerical-monarchist regime of President [[Patrice de Mac-Mahon, Duke of Magenta|MacMahon]]</span>

				<span class='text'>It was sparked by an editorial entitled &quot;Krieg-in-Sicht&quot; (&quot;War in Sight&quot;) in a Berlin newspaper close to the government, the ''Post''</span>
				<span class='text'>It indicated that highly influential Germans were alarmed by France's rapid recovery from defeat in 1875 and its announcement of an increase in the size of its army</span>
				<span class='text'>They talked of launching a preventive war against France to hold it down</span>
				<span class='text'>Bismarck denied knowing about the article ahead of time, but he certainly knew about the talk of preventive war</span>
				<span class='text'>The editorial produced a war scare</span>
				<span class='text'>Britain and Russia made it clear they would not tolerate a preventive war against France</span>
				<span class='text'>Bismarck did not want any war either, and the crisis blew over</span>
				<span class='text'>It was a rare instance where his opponents outmaneuvered and embarrassed Bismarck, but he learned an important lesson</span>
				<span class='text'>It forced him to take into account the fear and alarm that his bullying and Germany's fast-growing power was causing among its neighbors</span>
				<span class='text'>The crisis reinforced Bismarck's determination that Germany should work in proactive fashion to preserve the peace in Europe, rather than passively let events take their own course and react to them</span>

				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Taylor|1969|p=212}} He can be seen as a marginal contributor to [[Italian unification]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Politics surrounding the 1866 [[Austro-Prussian War]] allowed Italy to annex [[Venetia (region)|Venetia]], which had been a kingdom of the Austrian Empire since the 1815 [[Congress of Vienna]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, French mobilization for the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871 made it necessary for Napoleon III to withdraw his troops from Rome and [[The Papal States]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Without these two events, Italian unification would have been a more prolonged process</span>
				<span class='text'>==Russia===After Russia's victory over the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War]] of 1877–78, Bismarck helped negotiate a settlement at the [[Congress of Berlin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Treaty of Berlin, 1878|Treaty of Berlin]] revised the earlier [[Treaty of San Stefano]], reducing the size of newly independent Bulgaria (a pro-Russian state at that time)</span>
				<span class='text'>Bismarck and other European leaders opposed the growth of Russian influence and tried to protect the integrity of the Ottoman Empire (see [[Eastern Question]])</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, Russo-German relations further suffered, with the Russian chancellor Gorchakov denouncing Bismarck for compromising his nation's victory</span>
				<span class='text'>The relationship was additionally strained due to Germany's protectionist trade policies</span>
				<span class='text'>Some in the German military clamored for a [[preemptive war]] with Russia, but Bismarck said that &quot;Preemptive war is like committing suicide for fear of death</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{Sfn|Retallack|2008|p=29}}===Triple Alliance===The League of the Three Emperors having fallen apart, Bismarck negotiated the [[Dual Alliance (1879)|Dual Alliance]] with Austria-Hungary, in which each guaranteed the other against Russian attack</span>
				<span class='text'>He also negotiated the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] in 1882 with Austria-Hungary and Italy, and Italy and Austria-Hungary soon reached the &quot;Mediterranean Agreement&quot; with Britain</span>
				<span class='text'>Attempts to reconcile Germany and Russia did not have lasting effect: the Three Emperors' League was re-established in 1881 but quickly fell apart, ending Russian-Austrian-Prussian solidarity, which had existed in various forms since 1813</span>
				<span class='text'>Bismarck therefore negotiated the [[Reinsurance Treaty]] of 1887 with Russia, in order to prevent Franco-Russian encirclement of Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>Both powers promised to remain neutral towards one another unless Russia attacked Austria-Hungary</span>
				<span class='text'>However, after Bismarck's departure from office in 1890, Wilhelm II failed to renew the Reinsurance Treaty, thus creating a critical problem for Germany in the event of a war</span>
				<span class='text'>==Colonies===Bismarck had opposed colonial acquisitions, arguing that the burden of obtaining, maintaining, and defending such possessions would outweigh any potential benefit</span>
				<span class='text'>He felt that colonies did not pay for themselves, that the German bureaucratic system would not work well in the easy-going tropics, and that the diplomatic disputes colonies brought would distract Germany from its central interest, Europe itself</span>

				<span class='text'>Immediately after the peace, he had tried to paralyse the Balkan rivals by the formation of the Three Emperors' League</span>

				<span class='text'>The minimum payments for medical treatment and sick pay for up to 13 weeks were legally fixed</span>

				<span class='text'>Bismarck had originally proposed that the federal government pay a portion of the accident insurance contribution</span>
				<span class='text'>Bismarck wanted to demonstrate the willingness of the German government to reduce the hardship experienced by the German workers so as to wean them away from supporting the various left-wing parties, most importantly the Social Democrats</span>
				<span class='text'>The National Liberals took this program to be an expression of [[State Socialism]], against which they were dead set</span>
				<span class='text'>The Centre Party was afraid of the expansion of federal power at the expense of states' rights</span>
				<span class='text'>s a result, the only way the program could be passed at all was for the entire expense to be underwritten by the employers</span>
				<span class='text'>To facilitate this, Bismarck arranged for the administration of this program to be placed in the hands of &quot;Der Arbeitgeberverband in den beruflichen Korporationen&quot; (the Organization of Employers in Occupational Corporations)</span>
				<span class='text'>This organization established central and bureaucratic insurance offices on the federal, and in some cases the state level to actually administer the program whose benefits kicked in to replace the sickness insurance program as of the 14th week</span>
				<span class='text'>It paid for medical treatment and a pension of up to two thirds of earned wages if the worker were fully disabled</span>

				<span class='text'>Unlike the accident insurance and sickness insurance programs, this program covered all categories of workers (industrial, agrarian, artisans and servants) from the start</span>
				<span class='text'>Also, unlike the other two programs, the principle that the national government should contribute a portion of the underwriting cost, with the other two portions prorated accordingly, was accepted without question</span>

				<span class='text'>}In 1888, the German Emperor, Wilhelm I, died leaving the throne to his son, [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Friedrich III]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The new monarch was already suffering from an incurable throat cancer and died after reigning for only 99 days</span>
				<span class='text'>He was succeeded by his son, [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Wilhelm II]], who opposed Bismarck's careful foreign policy, preferring vigorous and rapid expansion to enlarge Germany's &quot;place in the sun&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Craig, (1978) pp 225–29&lt;/ref&gt;Bismarck was 16 years older than Friedrich</span>
				<span class='text'>Before the latter became terminally ill, Bismarck did not expect he would live to see Wilhelm ascend to the throne and thus had no strategy to deal with him</span>
				<span class='text'>Conflicts between Wilhelm and his chancellor soon poisoned their relationship</span>
				<span class='text'>Their final split occurred after Bismarck tried to implement far-reaching anti-socialist laws in early 1890</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''Kartell'' majority in the Reichstag, including the amalgamated Conservative Party and the National Liberal Party, was willing to make most of the laws permanent</span>
				<span class='text'>However, it was split about the law granting the police the power to expel socialist agitators from their homes, a power that had been used excessively at times against political opponents</span>
				<span class='text'>The National Liberals refused to make this law permanent, while the Conservatives supported only the entirety of the bill and threatened to and eventually vetoed the entire bill in session because Bismarck would not agree to a modified bill</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, 2011, pp</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|220px|[[Franz von Lenbach|Lenbach]] painting of Bismarck in retirement (1895)]]As the debate continued, Wilhelm became increasingly interested in social problems, especially the treatment of mine workers during their strike in 1889</span>
				<span class='text'>Keeping with his active policy in government, he routinely interrupted Bismarck in Council to make clear his social policy</span>
				<span class='text'>Bismarck sharply disagreed with Wilhelm's policy and worked to circumvent it</span>
				<span class='text'>Even though Wilhelm supported the altered anti-socialist bill, Bismarck pushed for his support to veto the bill in its entirety</span>
				<span class='text'>When his arguments could not convince Wilhelm, Bismarck became excited and agitated until uncharacteristically blurting out his motive to see the bill fail: to have the socialists agitate until a violent clash occurred that could be used as a pretext to crush them</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilhelm replied that he was not willing to open his reign with a bloody campaign against his own subjects</span>
				<span class='text'>The next day, after realizing his blunder, Bismarck attempted to reach a compromise with Wilhelm by agreeing to his social policy towards industrial workers and even suggested a European council to discuss working conditions, presided over by the Emperor </span>
				<span class='text'>till, a turn of events eventually led to his breaking with Wilhelm</span>
				<span class='text'>Bismarck, feeling pressured and unappreciated by the Emperor and undermined by ambitious advisers, refused to sign a proclamation regarding the protection of workers along with Wilhelm, as was required by the German constitution</span>
				<span class='text'>His refusal to sign was apparently to protest Wilhelm's ever increasing interference with Bismarck's previously unquestioned authority</span>
				<span class='text'>Bismarck also worked behind the scenes to break the Continental labour council on which Wilhelm had set his heart</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Craig, (1978) pp 171–79&lt;/ref&gt;The final break came as Bismarck searched for a new parliamentary majority, as his ''Kartell'' was voted from power as a consequence of the anti-socialist bill fiasco</span>
				<span class='text'>The remaining forces in the Reichstag were the [[Catholic Centre Party]] and the Conservative Party</span>
				<span class='text'>Bismarck wished to form a new block with the Centre Party and invited [[Ludwig Windthorst]], the parliamentary leader, to discuss an alliance</span>
				<span class='text'>That would be Bismarck's last political manoeuvre</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilhelm was furious to hear about Windthorst's visit</span>
				<span class='text'>n a parliamentary state, the head of government depends on the confidence of the parliamentary majority and certainly has the right to form coalitions to ensure his policies have majority support</span>
				<span class='text'>However, in Germany, the Chancellor depended on the confidence of the Emperor alone, and Wilhelm believed that the Emperor had the right to be informed before his minister's meeting</span>
				<span class='text'>After a heated argument in Bismarck's office, Wilhelm, to whom Bismarck had shown a letter from Tsar Alexander III describing Wilhelm as a &quot;badly brought-up boy&quot;, stormed out, after first ordering the rescinding of the Cabinet Order of 1851, which had forbidden Prussian Cabinet Ministers from reporting directly to the King of Prussia and required them instead to report via the Chancellor</span>
				<span class='text'>Bismarck, forced for the first time into a situation that he could not use to his advantage, wrote a blistering letter of resignation, decrying Wilhelm's interference in foreign and domestic policy, but the letter was published only after Bismarck's death</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Now the humble posture that he had necessarily adopted in his written communications with his royal master had become his real posture</span>
				<span class='text'>The old servant, no matter how great and how brilliant, had become in reality what he had always played as on a stage: a servant who could be dismissed at will by his Sovereign</span>
				<span class='text'> He had defended that royal prerogative because it had allowed him to carry out his immense will; now the absolute prerogative of the Emperor became what it has always been, the prerogative of the sovereign</span>
				<span class='text'> Having crushed his parliamentary opponents, flattened and abused his ministers, and refused to allow himself to be bound by any loyalty</span>
				<span class='text'> Bismarck had no ally left when he needed it</span>
				<span class='text'> It was not his cabinet nor his parliamentary majority</span>
				<span class='text'> He had made sure that it remained the sovereign's, and so it was that he fell because of a system that he preserved and bequeathed to the unstable young Emperor</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Müller (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Urbach (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Steinberg, his achievements in 1862–71 were &quot;the greatest diplomatic and political achievement by any leader in the last two centuries</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, 2011, p</span>
				<span class='text'>184</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Bismarck's most important legacy is the unification of Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>Germany had existed as a collection of hundreds of separate principalities and [[Imperial Free City|Free Cities]] since the formation of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Over the centuries various rulers had tried to unify the German states without success until Bismarck</span>
				<span class='text'>Largely as a result of Bismarck's efforts, the various German kingdoms were united into a single country</span>
				<span class='text'>ollowing unification, Germany became one of the most powerful nations in Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>Bismarck's astute, cautious, and pragmatic foreign policies allowed Germany to peacefully retain the powerful position into which he had brought it; maintaining amiable diplomacy with almost all European nations</span>
				<span class='text'>France was the main exception because of the Franco-Prussian war and Bismarck's harsh subsequent policies; France became one of Germany's most bitter enemies in Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>Austria, too, was weakened by the creation of a German Empire, though to a much lesser extent than France</span>
				<span class='text'>Bismarck believed that as long as Britain, Russia and Italy were assured of the peaceful nature of the German Empire, French belligerency could be contained; his diplomatic feats were undone, however, by Kaiser [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], whose policies unified other European powers against Germany in time for World War I</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Bismarck-Nationaldenkmal, März 2008</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|187px|Bismarck statue in Berlin]]Historians stress that Bismarck's peace-oriented, &quot;saturated continental diplomacy&quot; was increasingly unpopular, because it consciously reined in any expansionist drives</span>
				<span class='text'>In dramatic contrast stands the ambition of Wilhelm II's ''[[Weltpolitik]]'' to secure the Reich's future through expansion, leading to World War I</span>
				<span class='text'>Likewise Bismarck's policy to deny the military a dominant voice in foreign political decision making was overturned by 1914 as Germany became an armed state</span>
				<span class='text'>ismarck's psychology and personal traits have not been so favourably received by scholars</span>
				<span class='text'>The historian Jonathan Steinberg portrays a demonic genius who was deeply vengeful, even toward his closest friends and family members</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;blockquote&gt;[Bismarck's friend, German diplomat [[Kurd von Schlözer]]] began to see Bismarck as a kind of malign genius who, behind the various postures, concealed an ice-cold contempt for his fellow human beings and a methodical determination to control and ruin them</span>
				<span class='text'>His easy chat combined blunt truths, partial revelations, and outright deceptions</span>
				<span class='text'>His extraordinary double ability to see how groups would react and the willingness to use violence to make them obey, the capacity to read group behavior and the force to make them move to his will, gave him the chance to exercise what [Steinberg has] called his &quot;sovereign self&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, 2011, p</span>
				<span class='text'>466&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Evans says he was &quot;intimidating and unscrupulous, playing to others' frailties, not their strengths</span>

				<span class='text'>9&lt;/ref&gt; British historians, including Steinberg, Evans, Taylor, Palmer and Crankshaw, see Bismarck as an ambivalent figure, undoubtedly a man of great skill but who left no lasting system in place to guide successors less skilled than himself</span>
				<span class='text'>Being a committed monarchist himself, Bismarck allowed no effective constitutional check on the power of the Emperor, thus placing a time bomb in the foundation of the Germany that he created</span>
				<span class='text'>bservers at the time and ever since have commented on Bismarck's skill as a writer</span>
				<span class='text'>As [[Henry Kissinger]] has noted, &quot;The man of 'blood and iron' wrote prose of extraordinary directness and lucidity, comparable in distinctiveness to [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]]'s use of the English language</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{Sfn | Kissinger | 2011}}During most of his nearly 30-year-long tenure, Bismarck held undisputed control over the government's policies</span>
				<span class='text'>He was well supported by his friend [[Albrecht von Roon]], the war minister, as well as the leader of the Prussian army [[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder|Helmuth von Moltke]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Bismarck's diplomatic moves relied on a victorious Prussian military, and these two men gave Bismarck the victories he needed to convince the smaller German states to join Prussia</span>
				<span class='text'>ismarck took steps to silence or restrain political opposition, as evidenced by laws restricting the freedom of the press, and the anti-socialist laws</span>
				<span class='text'>He waged a culture war (''[[Kulturkampf]]'') against the Catholic Church until he realized the conservatism of the Catholics made them natural allies against the Socialists</span>
				<span class='text'>His king [[Wilhelm I of Germany|Wilhelm I]] rarely challenged the Chancellor's decisions; on several occasions, Bismarck obtained his monarch's approval by threatening to resign</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Wilhelm II intended to govern the country himself, making the ousting of Bismarck one of his first tasks as Kaiser</span>
				<span class='text'>Bismarck's successors as Chancellor were much less influential, as power was concentrated in the Emperor's hands</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1871, he was further created ''[[Fürst von Bismarck]]'' (&quot;Prince of Bismarck&quot;) and accorded the style of ''Durchlaucht'' (equivalent to &quot;Serene Highness&quot;); this princely title descended only to his eldest male heirs</span>
				<span class='text'>==Duke of Lauenburg===In 1890, Bismarck was granted the title of ''[[Herzog von Lauenburg]]'' (&quot;Duke of Lauenburg&quot;); the Duchy was one of the territories that Prussia seized from the Danish king in 1864</span>
				<span class='text'>t was Bismarck's ambition to be assimilated into the [[German mediatisation|mediatized]] houses of Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>He attempted to persuade Kaiser Wilhelm I that he should be endowed with the sovereign duchy of Lauenburg, in reward for his services to the imperial family and the German empire</span>
				<span class='text'>This was on the understanding that Bismarck would immediately restore the duchy to Prussia; all that he wanted was the privilege of a mediatized family for himself and his descendants</span>
				<span class='text'>This novel idea was turned down by the conservative emperor, who thought that he had already given the chancellor enough rewards</span>
				<span class='text'>There is reason to believe that he informed Wilhelm II of his wishes</span>
				<span class='text'>After being forced by the sovereign to resign, he received the purely honorific title of &quot;Duke of Lauenburg&quot;, without the duchy itself and the sovereignty that would have transformed his family into a mediatized house</span>
				<span class='text'>Bismarck regarded it as a mockery of his ambition, and he considered nothing more cruel than this action of the emperor</span>
