				<span class='text'>vg}}'''Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde''' (16 October 1854{{spaced ndash}}30 November 1900) was an Irish   playwright, novelist, essayist, and poet</span>
				<span class='text'>After writing in different forms throughout the 1880s, he became one of London's most popular playwrights in the early 1890s</span>
				<span class='text'>He is remembered for his epigrams, his novel ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'', his plays, as well as the circumstances of his imprisonment and early death</span>
				<span class='text'>ilde's parents were successful [[Anglo-Irish people|Anglo-Irish]] Dublin intellectuals</span>
				<span class='text'>Their son became fluent in French and German early in life</span>
				<span class='text'>At university, Wilde read [[Literae Humaniores#Greats|Greats]]; he proved himself to be an outstanding classicist, first at [[Trinity College, Dublin|Dublin]], then at [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Oxford]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He became known for his involvement in the rising philosophy of [[aestheticism]], led by two of his tutors, [[Walter Pater]] and [[John Ruskin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After university, Wilde moved to London into fashionable cultural and social circles</span>
				<span class='text'>As a spokesman for aestheticism, he tried his hand at various literary activities: he published a book of poems, lectured in the United States and Canada on the new &quot;English Renaissance in Art&quot;, and then returned to London where he worked prolifically as a journalist</span>
				<span class='text'>Known for his biting wit, flamboyant dress and glittering conversation, Wilde became one of the best-known personalities of his day</span>
				<span class='text'>t the turn of the 1890s, he refined his ideas about the supremacy of art in a series of dialogues and essays, and incorporated themes of decadence, duplicity, and beauty into his only novel, ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' (1890)</span>
				<span class='text'>The opportunity to construct aesthetic details precisely, and combine them with larger social themes, drew Wilde to write drama</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote ''[[Salome (play)|Salome]]'' (1891) in French in Paris but it was refused a licence for England due to the absolute prohibition of Biblical subjects on the English stage</span>
				<span class='text'>Unperturbed, Wilde produced four society comedies in the early 1890s, which made him one of the most successful playwrights of late Victorian London</span>
				<span class='text'>t the height of his fame and success, while his masterpiece, ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'' (1895), was still on stage in London, Wilde had [[John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry|the Marquess of Queensberry]] prosecuted for [[Defamation|libel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Marquess was the father of Wilde's lover, [[Lord Alfred Douglas]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The charge carried a penalty of up to two years in prison</span>
				<span class='text'>The trial unearthed evidence that caused Wilde to drop his charges and led to his own arrest and trial for [[Labouchere Amendment|gross indecency]] with men</span>
				<span class='text'>After two more trials he was convicted and imprisoned for two years' [[Penal labour|hard labour]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1897, in prison, he wrote ''[[De Profundis (letter)|De Profundis]]'', which was published in 1905, a long letter which discusses his spiritual journey through his trials, forming a dark counterpoint to his earlier philosophy of pleasure</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon his release he left immediately for France, never to return to Ireland or Britain</span>
				<span class='text'>There he wrote his last work, ''[[The Ballad of Reading Gaol]]'' (1898), a long poem commemorating the harsh rhythms of prison life</span>
				<span class='text'>He died destitute in Paris at the age of 46</span>

				<span class='text'>According to Fox's own testimony written by him years later in ''Donahoe's Magazine'' in 1905, Jane Wilde would visit his chapel in Glencree, Co Wicklow for Mass and would take her sons with her</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Fox described it in this way:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I am not sure if she ever became a Catholic herself but it was not long before she asked me to instruct two of her children, one of them being the future erratic genius, Oscar Wilde</span>
				<span class='text'>After a few weeks I baptized these two children, Lady Wilde herself being present on the occasion</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; &lt;/blockquote&gt;In addition to his children with his wife, Sir William Wilde was the father of three children born out of wedlock before his marriage: Henry Wilson, born in 1838, and Emily and Mary Wilde, born in 1847 and 1849, respectively, of different maternity to Henry</span>
				<span class='text'>Sir William acknowledged paternity of his illegitimate children and provided for their education, but they were reared by his relatives rather than with his wife and legitimate children</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ellmann (1988:13)&lt;/ref&gt;In 1855, the family moved to No</span>
				<span class='text'>1 [[Merrion Square]], where Wilde's sister, Isola, was born in 1857</span>

				<span class='text'>Trinity, one of the leading classical schools, placed him with scholars such as [[Robert Yelverton Tyrrell|R</span>
				<span class='text'>Y</span>
				<span class='text'>Tyrell]], [[Arthur Palmer (scholar)|Arthur Palmer]], [[Edward Dowden]] and his tutor, [[John Pentland Mahaffy|J</span>
				<span class='text'>P</span>
				<span class='text'>Mahaffy]] who inspired his interest in [[Greek literature]]</span>
				<span class='text'>As a student Wilde worked with Mahaffy on the latter's book ''Social Life in Greece''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Sandulescu (1997:59)&lt;/ref&gt; Wilde, despite later reservations, called Mahaffy &quot;my first and best teacher&quot; and &quot;the scholar who showed me how to love Greek things&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ellmann (1988:26)&lt;/ref&gt; For his part, Mahaffy boasted of having created Wilde; later, he named him &quot;the only blot on my tutorship&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ellmann (1988:27)&lt;/ref&gt;The [[University Philosophical Society]] also provided an education, discussing intellectual and artistic subjects such as [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti|Rossetti]] and [[Algernon Charles Swinburne|Swinburne]] weekly</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilde quickly became an established member&amp;nbsp;– the members' suggestion book for 1874 contains two pages of banter (sportingly) mocking Wilde's emergent aestheticism</span>
				<span class='text'>He presented a paper entitled &quot;Aesthetic Morality&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ellmann (1988:29)&lt;/ref&gt; At Trinity, Wilde established himself as an outstanding student: he came first in his class in his first year, won a scholarship by competitive examination in his second, and then, in his finals, won the Berkeley Gold Medal, the University's highest academic award in Greek</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Coakley (1994:154)&lt;/ref&gt; He was encouraged to compete for a [[demyship]] to [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]&amp;nbsp;– which he won easily, having already studied Greek for over nine years</span>
				<span class='text'>==Magdalen College, Oxford===[[File:Oscar Wilde (1854-1900), by Hills &amp; Saunders, Rugby &amp; Oxford 3 april 1876</span>

				<span class='text'>Oscar Wilde at Oxford]]At Magdalen, he read [[Greats]] from 1874 to 1878, and from there he applied to join the [[Oxford Union]], but failed to be elected</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See pages 183–5 of Thomas Toughill's &quot;The Ripper Code&quot; (The History Press, 2008) which mention Toughill's research in the archives of the Oxford Union</span>
				<span class='text'>This book also contains a photograph of Wilde's unsuccessful entry in the Union's &quot;Probational Members Subscriptions&quot; (022/8/F2/1) for the period 1862–1890</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Attracted by its dress, secrecy, and ritual, Wilde petitioned the Apollo [[Masonic Lodge]] at Oxford, and was soon raised to the &quot;Sublime Degree of Master Mason&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ellmann 1988:39&quot;&gt;Ellmann (1988:39)&lt;/ref&gt; During a resurgent interest in Freemasonry in his third year, he commented he &quot;would be awfully sorry to give it up if I secede from the Protestant Heresy&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ellmann (1988:65)&lt;/ref&gt; He was deeply considering converting to Catholicism, discussing the possibility with clergy several times</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1877, Wilde was left speechless after an audience with [[Pope Pius IX|Pope Pius&amp;nbsp;IX]] in Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ellmann (1988:70)&lt;/ref&gt; He eagerly read [[John Henry Newman|Cardinal Newman]]'s books, and became more serious in 1878, when he met the Reverend Sebastian Bowden, a priest in the [[Brompton Oratory]] who had received some high profile converts</span>
				<span class='text'>Neither his father, who threatened to cut off his funds, nor Mahaffy thought much of the plan; but mostly Wilde, the supreme individualist, balked at the last minute from pledging himself to any formal creed</span>
				<span class='text'>On the appointed day of his baptism, Father Bowden received a bunch of altar lilies instead</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilde retained a lifelong interest in Catholic theology and liturgy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Sandelsecu (1994:375–376)&lt;/ref&gt;While at Magdalen College, Wilde became particularly well known for his role in the [[Aesthetic movement|aesthetic]] and [[decadent movement]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>He wore his hair long, openly scorned &quot;manly&quot; sports though he occasionally boxed,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ellmann 1988:39&quot;/&gt; and decorated his rooms with peacock feathers, lilies, sunflowers, blue china and other ''objets d'art'', once remarking to friends whom he entertained lavishly, &quot;I find it harder and harder every day to live up to my blue china</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name='Ellmann43'&gt;Ellmann (1988:43–44)&lt;/ref&gt; The line quickly became famous, accepted as a slogan by aesthetes but used against them by critics who sensed in it a terrible vacuousness</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name='Ellmann43'/&gt; Some elements disdained the aesthetes, but their languishing attitudes and showy costumes became a recognised pose</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Breen (1977, 2000) pp22–23&lt;/ref&gt; Wilde was once physically attacked by a group of four fellow students, and dealt with them single-handedly, surprising critics</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ellmann (1988:44)&lt;/ref&gt; By his third year Wilde had truly begun to create himself and his myth, and saw his learning developing in much larger ways than merely the prescribed texts</span>
				<span class='text'>This attitude resulted in his being [[Rustication (academia)|rusticated]] for one term, when he nonchalantly returned to college late from a trip to Greece with Prof</span>
				<span class='text'>Mahaffy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ellmann (1988:78)&lt;/ref&gt;Wilde did not meet Walter Pater until his third year, but had been enthralled by his ''[[Studies in the History of the Renaissance]]'', published during Wilde's final year in Trinity</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ellmann (1988:46)&lt;/ref&gt; Pater argued that man's sensibility to beauty should be refined above all else, and that each moment should be felt to its fullest extent</span>
				<span class='text'>Years later, in ''[[De Profundis (letter)|De Profundis]]'', Wilde called Pater's ''Studies</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>' &quot;that book that has had such a strange influence over my life&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''De Profundis'', Holland/Hart-Davis (2000:735)&lt;/ref&gt; He learned tracts of the book by heart, and carried it with him on travels in later years</span>
				<span class='text'>Pater gave Wilde his sense of almost flippant devotion to art, though it was [[John Ruskin]] who gave him a purpose for it</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ellmann95&quot;&gt;Ellmann (1988:95)&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin despaired at the self-validating aestheticism of Pater, arguing that the importance of art lies in its potential for the betterment of society</span>
				<span class='text'>Ruskin admired beauty, but believed it must be allied with, and applied to, moral good</span>
				<span class='text'>When Wilde eagerly attended Ruskin's lecture series ''The Aesthetic and Mathematic Schools of Art in Florence'', he learned about aesthetics as simply the non-mathematical elements of painting</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite being given to neither early rising nor manual labour, Wilde volunteered for Ruskin's project to convert a swampy country lane into a smart road neatly edged with flowers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ellmann95&quot;/&gt;Wilde won the 1878 [[Newdigate Prize]] for his poem &quot;[[s:Ravenna|Ravenna]]&quot;, which reflected on his visit there the year before, and he duly read it at [[Encaenia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ellmann (1988:93)&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1878, he graduated with a [[First class honours|double first]] in his B</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ellmann (1988:289)&lt;/ref&gt;]]Criticism over artistic matters in the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'' provoked a letter in self-defence, and soon Wilde was a contributor to that and other journals during the years 1885–87</span>
				<span class='text'>He enjoyed reviewing and journalism; the form suited his style</span>
				<span class='text'>He could organise and share his views on art, literature and life, yet in a format less tedious than lecturing</span>

				<span class='text'>With his youth nearly over, and a family to support, in mid-1887 Wilde became the editor of ''The Lady's World'' magazine, his name prominently appearing on the cover</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Mason (1914:219)&lt;/ref&gt; He promptly renamed it ''[[The Woman's World]]'' and raised its tone, adding serious articles on parenting, culture, and politics, keeping discussions of fashion and arts</span>
				<span class='text'>Two pieces of fiction were usually included, one to be read to children, the other for the ladies themselves</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilde worked hard to solicit good contributions from his wide artistic acquaintance, including those of Lady Wilde and his wife Constance, while his own &quot;Literary and Other Notes&quot; were themselves popular and amusing</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ellmann (1988:276)&lt;/ref&gt; The initial vigour and excitement he brought to the job began to fade as administration, commuting and office life became tedious</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Clayworth (1997:91)&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time as Wilde's interest flagged, the publishers became concerned anew about circulation: sales, at the relatively high price of one shilling, remained low</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Clayworth (1997:95)&lt;/ref&gt; Increasingly sending instructions to the magazine by letter, he began a new period of creative work and his own column appeared less regularly</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ransome&quot;&gt;Ransome (1912:101)&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of writing a short but serious essay on the question, Wilde tossed the theory amongst the three characters of the story, allowing it to unfold as background to the plot</span>
				<span class='text'>The story thus is an early masterpiece of Wilde's combing many elements that interested him, conversation, literature and the idea that to shed oneself of an idea one must first convince another of its truth</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ransome (1912:102)&lt;/ref&gt; Ransome concludes that Wilde succeeds precisely because the literary criticism is unveiled with such a deft touch</span>

				<span class='text'>In January 1889, ''The Decay of Lying: A Dialogue'' appeared in ''[[The Nineteenth Century]]'', and ''Pen, Pencil and Poison'', a satirical biography of [[Thomas Griffiths Wainewright]], in the ''[[Fortnightly Review]]'', edited by Wilde's friend [[Frank Harris]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Mason (1914:71)&lt;/ref&gt; Two of Wilde's four writings on aesthetics are dialogues: though Wilde had evolved professionally from lecturer to writer, he retained an oral tradition of sorts</span>
				<span class='text'>Having always excelled as a wit and raconteur, he often composed by assembling phrases, ''bons mots'' and witticisms into a longer, cohesive work</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Raby (1997:98)&lt;/ref&gt;Wilde was concerned about the effect of moralising on art, he believed in art's redemptive, developmental powers: &quot;Art is individualism, and individualism is a disturbing and disintegrating force</span>
				<span class='text'>There lies its immense value</span>
				<span class='text'>For what it seeks is to disturb monotony of type, slavery of custom, tyranny of habit, and the reduction of man to the level of a machine</span>

				<span class='text'>Distraught that his beauty will fade while the portrait stays beautiful, he inadvertently makes a [[deal with the Devil|Faustian bargain]] in which only the painted image grows old while he stays beautiful and young</span>
				<span class='text'>For Wilde, the purpose of art would be to guide life as if beauty alone were its object</span>
				<span class='text'>As Gray's portrait allows him to escape the corporeal ravages of his hedonism, Wilde sought to juxtapose the beauty he saw in art with daily life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Mendelshon&quot;/&gt;Reviewers immediately criticised the novel's decadence and homosexual allusions; ''[[The Daily Chronicle]]'' for example, called it &quot;unclean&quot;, &quot;poisonous&quot;, and &quot;heavy with the mephitic odours of moral and spiritual putrefaction&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ross (2011:1')&lt;/ref&gt; Wilde vigorously responded, writing to the editor of the ''Scots Observer'', in which he clarified his stance on ethics and aesthetics in art – &quot;If a work of art is rich and vital and complete, those who have artistic instincts will see its beauty and those to whom ethics appeal more strongly will see its moral lesson</span>

				<span class='text'>Wilde though, not content with being better known than ever in London, returned to Paris in October 1891, this time as a respected writer</span>
				<span class='text'>He was received at the ''salons littéraires'', including the famous ''mardis'' of [[Stéphane Mallarmé]], a renowned [[symbolism (arts)|symbolist]] poet of the time</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ellmann (1988:316)&lt;/ref&gt; Wilde's two plays during the 1880s, ''[[Vera; or, The Nihilists]]'' and ''[[The Duchess of Padua]]'', had not met with much success</span>
				<span class='text'>He had continued his interest in the theatre and now, after finding his voice in prose, his thoughts turned again to the dramatic form as the biblical iconography of [[Salome]] filled his mind</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ellmann (1988:322)&lt;/ref&gt; One evening, after discussing depictions of Salome throughout history, he returned to his hotel and noticed a blank copybook lying on the desk, and it occurred to him to write in it what he had been saying</span>
				<span class='text'>The result was a new play, ''[[Salome (play)|Salomé]]'', written rapidly and in French</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ellmann (1988:323)&lt;/ref&gt;A tragedy, it tells the story of Salome, the stepdaughter of the [[Tetrarchy (Judea)|tetrarch]] [[Herod Antipas]], who, to her stepfather's dismay but [[Herodias|mother]]'s delight, requests the head of Jokanaan ([[John the Baptist]]) on a silver platter as a reward for dancing the Dance of the Seven Veils</span>
				<span class='text'>When Wilde returned to London just before Christmas the ''Paris Echo'' referred to him as &quot;''le great event''&quot; of the season</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ellmann (1988:326)&lt;/ref&gt; Rehearsals of the play, starring [[Sarah Bernhardt]], began but the play was refused a licence by the Lord Chamberlain, since it depicted biblical characters</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Mason (1914:371)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Salome'' was published jointly in Paris and London in 1893, but was not performed until 1896 in Paris, during Wilde's later incarceration</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Mason (1914:369)&lt;/ref&gt;===Comedies of society==={{Main| Lady Windermere's Fan|A Woman of No Importance| An Ideal Husband}}Wilde, who had first set out to irritate Victorian society with his dress and talking points, then outrage it with ''Dorian Gray'', his novel of vice hidden beneath art, finally found a way to critique society on its own terms</span>
				<span class='text'>''Lady Windermere's Fan'' was first performed on 20 February 1892 at St James Theatre, packed with the cream of society</span>
				<span class='text'>On the surface a witty comedy, there is subtle subversion underneath: &quot;it concludes with collusive concealment rather than collective disclosure&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ellmann (1988:344)&lt;/ref&gt; The audience, like Lady Windermere, are forced to soften harsh social codes in favour of a more nuanced view</span>
				<span class='text'>The play was enormously popular, touring the country for months, but largely trashed by conservative critics</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ellmann (1988:347)&lt;/ref&gt;It was followed by ''A Woman of No Importance'' in 1893, another Victorian comedy: revolving around the spectre of illegitimate births, mistaken identities and late revelations</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ellmann (1980:360)&lt;/ref&gt; Wilde was commissioned to write two more plays and ''An Ideal Husband'', written in 1894,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wilde | first = Oscar | title = An ideal husband</span>
				<span class='text'>Act III: London: typescript with extensive autograph revisions, 1894|oclc=270589204}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed in January 1895</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ellmann (1988:404)&lt;/ref&gt;Peter Raby said these essentially English plays were well-pitched, &quot;Wilde, with one eye on the dramatic genius of Ibsen, and the other on the commercial competition in London's West End, targeted his audience with adroit precision&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Wilde and [[Lord Alfred Douglas]] in 1893&lt;/div&gt;]]In mid-1891 [[Lionel Johnson]] introduced Wilde to [[Lord Alfred Douglas]], an undergraduate at Oxford at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>Known to his family and friends as &quot;Bosie&quot;, he was a handsome and spoilt young man</span>
				<span class='text'>An intimate friendship sprang up between Wilde and Douglas and by 1893 Wilde was infatuated with Douglas and they consorted together regularly in a tempestuous affair</span>
				<span class='text'>If Wilde was relatively indiscreet, even flamboyant, in the way he acted, Douglas was reckless in public</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilde, who was earning up to £100 a week from his plays (his salary at ''The Woman's World'' had been £6), indulged Douglas's every whim: material, artistic or sexual</span>
				<span class='text'>ouglas soon dragged Wilde into the Victorian underground of gay prostitution and Wilde was introduced to a series of young, working class, male prostitutes from 1892 onwards by Alfred Taylor</span>
				<span class='text'>These infrequent rendezvous usually took the same form: Wilde would meet the boy, offer him gifts, dine him privately and then take him to a hotel room</span>
				<span class='text'>Unlike Wilde's idealised, pederastic relations with Ross, [[John Gray (poet)|John Gray]], and Douglas, all of whom remained part of his aesthetic circle, these consorts were uneducated and knew nothing of literature</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon his public and private lives had become sharply divided; in ''[[De Profundis (letter)|De Profundis]]'' he wrote to Douglas that &quot;It was like feasting with panthers; the danger was half the excitement</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>I did not know that when they were to strike at me it was to be at another's piping and at another's pay</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;''De Profundis'', Holland/Hart-Davis (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;Douglas and some Oxford friends founded a journal, ''The Chameleon'', to which Wilde &quot;sent a page of paradoxes originally destined for the ''Saturday Review''&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''De Profundis'', Holland/Hart-Davis (2000:702)&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[[s:Phrases and Philosophies for the Use of the Young|Phrases and Philosophies for the Use of the Young]]&quot; was to come under attack six months later at Wilde's trial, where he was forced to defend the magazine to which he had sent his work</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''De Profundis'', Holland/Hart-Davis (2000:703)&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, it became unique: ''The Chameleon'' was not published again</span>
				<span class='text'>ord Alfred's father, the [[John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry|Marquess of Queensberry]], was known for his outspoken atheism, brutish manner and creation of the modern rules of boxing</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref group=&quot;Notes&quot; name='d'&gt;Queensberry's oldest son, [[Francis Douglas, Viscount Drumlanrig]], possibly had an intimate association with [[Archibald Philip Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery]], the Prime Minister to whom he was private secretary, which ended with Drumlanrig's death in an unexplained shooting accident</span>
				<span class='text'>In any case the Marquess of Queensberry came to believe his sons had been corrupted by older homosexuals or, as he phrased it in a letter in the aftermath of Drumlanrig's death: &quot;Montgomerys, The Snob Queers like Rosebery and certainly Christian Hypocrite like Gladstone and the whole lot of you&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Ellmann (1988:402)&lt;/ref&gt; Queensberry, who feuded regularly with his son, confronted Wilde and Lord Alfred about the nature of their relationship several times, but Wilde was able to mollify him</span>
				<span class='text'>In June 1894, he called on Wilde at 16 Tite Street, without an appointment, and clarified his stance:&quot;I do not say that you are it, but you look it, and pose at it, which is just as bad</span>
				<span class='text'>And if I catch you and my son again in any public restaurant I will thrash you&quot; to which Wilde responded: &quot;I don't know what the Queensberry rules are, but the Oscar Wilde rule is to shoot on sight&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ellmann (1988:421)&lt;/ref&gt; His account in ''De Profundis'' was less triumphant: &quot;It was when, in my library at Tite Street, waving his small hands in the air in epileptic fury, your father</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>stood uttering every foul word his foul mind could think of, and screaming the loathsome threats he afterwards with such cunning carried out&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''De Profundis'', Holland/Hart-Davis (2000:699–700)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ellmann396&quot;&gt;Ellmann (1988:396)&lt;/ref&gt; Queensberry only described the scene once, saying Wilde had &quot;shown him the white feather&quot;, meaning he had acted in a cowardly way</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ellmann396&quot;/&gt; Though trying to remain calm, Wilde saw that he was becoming ensnared in a brutal family quarrel</span>
				<span class='text'>He did not wish to bear Queensberry's insults, but he knew to confront him could lead to disaster were his liaisons disclosed publicly</span>
				<span class='text'>==''The Importance of Being Earnest''==={{Main| The Importance of Being Earnest}}Wilde's final play again returns to the theme of switched identities: the play's two protagonists engage in &quot;bunburying&quot; (the maintenance of alternative personas in the town and country) which allows them to escape Victorian social mores</span>

				<span class='text'>While their characters often rise to serious themes in moments of crisis, ''Earnest'' lacks the by-now stock Wildean characters: there is no &quot;woman with a past&quot;, the principals are neither villainous nor cunning, simply idle cultivés, and the idealistic young women are not that innocent</span>
				<span class='text'>Mostly set in drawing rooms and almost completely lacking in action or violence, ''Earnest'' lacks the self-conscious decadence found in ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' and ''[[Salome (play)|Salome]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>[[Merlin Holland]] concludes that &quot;what Queensberry almost certainly wrote was &quot;posing {{Sic|som|domite}}&quot;, (Holland (2004:300))&lt;/ref&gt; Wilde, encouraged by Douglas and against the advice of his friends, initiated a [[private prosecution]] against Queensberry for [[libel]], since the note amounted to a public accusation that Wilde had committed the crime of [[sodomy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ueensberry was arrested on a charge of [[criminal libel]], a charge carrying a possible sentence of up to two years in prison ([http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>Under the [[Libel Act 1843|Act]], Queensberry could avoid conviction for libel only by demonstrating that his accusation was in fact true, and furthermore that there was some &quot;public benefit&quot; to having made the accusation openly</span>
				<span class='text'>Queensberry's lawyers thus hired private detectives to find evidence of Wilde's homosexual liaisons to prove the fact of the accusation</span>
				<span class='text'>They decided on a strategy of portraying Wilde as a depraved older man who habitually enticed naive youths into a life of vicious homosexuality to demonstrate that there was some public interest in making the accusation openly, ostensibly to warn off other youths who might otherwise have become entrapped by Wilde</span>
				<span class='text'>ilde's friends had advised him against the prosecution at a &quot;Saturday Review&quot; meeting at the [[Café Royal]] on 24 March 1895; [[Frank Harris]] warned him that &quot;they are going to prove sodomy against you&quot; and advised him to flee to France</span>

				<span class='text'>The extent of the evidence massed against Wilde forced him to declare meekly, &quot;I am the prosecutor in this case&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ellmann (1988:418)&lt;/ref&gt; Wilde's lawyer, Sir [[Edward George Clarke]], opened the case by pre-emptively asking Wilde about two suggestive letters Wilde had written to Douglas, which the defence had in its possession</span>
				<span class='text'>He characterised the first as a &quot;prose sonnet&quot; and admitted that the &quot;poetical language&quot; might seem strange to the court but claimed its intent was innocent</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilde stated that the letters had been obtained by blackmailers who had attempted to extort money from him, but he had refused, suggesting they should take the £60 (equal to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|60|1895|r=-2}}}} today) offered, &quot;unusual for a prose piece of that length&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He claimed to regard the letters as works of art rather than something of which to be ashamed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Foldy (1997:3)&lt;/ref&gt;Carson cross-examined Wilde on how he perceived the moral content of his works</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilde replied with characteristic wit and flippancy, claiming that works of art are not capable of being moral or immoral but only well or poorly made, and that only &quot;brutes and illiterates,&quot; whose views on art &quot;are incalculably stupid&quot;, would make such judgements about art</span>
				<span class='text'>Carson, a leading barrister, diverged from the normal practice of asking [[closed question]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>Carson pressed Wilde on each topic from every angle, squeezing out nuances of meaning from Wilde's answers, removing them from their aesthetic context and portraying Wilde as evasive and decadent</span>
				<span class='text'>While Wilde won the most laughs from the court, Carson scored the most legal points</span>

				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt;Carson then moved to the factual evidence and questioned Wilde about his acquaintances with younger, lower-class men</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilde admitted being on a first-name basis and lavishing gifts upon them, but insisted that nothing untoward had occurred and that the men were merely good friends of his</span>
				<span class='text'>Carson repeatedly pointed out the unusual nature of these relationships and insinuated that the men were prostitutes</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilde replied that he did not believe in social barriers, and simply enjoyed the society of young men</span>
				<span class='text'>Then Carson asked Wilde directly whether he had ever kissed a certain servant boy, Wilde responded, &quot;Oh, dear no</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a particularly plain boy&amp;nbsp;– unfortunately ugly&amp;nbsp;– I pitied him for it</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name='Foldy17'&gt;Foldy (1997:17)&lt;/ref&gt; Carson pressed him on the answer, repeatedly asking why the boy's ugliness was relevant</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilde hesitated, then for the first time became flustered: &quot;You sting me and insult me and try to unnerve me; and at times one says things flippantly when one ought to speak more seriously</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name='Foldy17'/&gt;In his opening speech for the defence, Carson announced that he had located several male prostitutes who were to testify that they had had sex with Wilde</span>
				<span class='text'>On the advice of his lawyers, Wilde dropped the prosecution</span>
				<span class='text'>Queensberry was found not guilty, as the court declared that his accusation that Wilde was &quot;posing as a Somdomite&quot; {{Sic}} was justified, &quot;true in substance and in fact</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Foldy 1997:19&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Libel Act 1843]], Queensberry's acquittal rendered Wilde legally liable for the considerable expenses Queensberry had incurred in his defence, which left Wilde bankrupt</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;''De Profundis'', Holland/Hart-Davis (2000:700)&lt;/ref&gt; Wilde blamed himself, though, for the ethical degradation of character that he allowed Douglas to bring about in him and took responsibility for his own fall, &quot;I am here for having tried to put your father in prison</span>

				<span class='text'> &quot;A Conversation with Oscar Wilde&quot;&amp;nbsp;– a civic monument to Wilde by [[Maggi Hambling]], on Adelaide Street, near Trafalgar Square, London]]Wilde's life continues to fascinate and he has been the subject of numerous biographies since his death</span>
				<span class='text'>The earliest were memoirs by those known to him: often they are personal or impressionistic accounts which can be good character sketches, but factually unreliable</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Raby (1997:6,10)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Harris]], his friend and editor, wrote a biography, ''Oscar Wilde: His Life and Confessions'' (1916); though prone to exaggeration and sometimes factually inaccurate, it offers a good literary portrait of Wilde</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Raby (1997:9)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lord Alfred Douglas]] wrote two books about his relationship with Wilde: ''Oscar Wilde and Myself'' (1914), largely ghost-written by [[T</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Crosland]], vindictively reacted to Douglas's discovery that ''De Profundis'' was addressed to him and defensively tried to distance him from Wilde's scandalous reputation</span>
				<span class='text'>Both authors later regretted their work</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Raby (1997:8)&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in ''Oscar Wilde: A Summing Up'' (1939) and his ''Autobiography'' he was more sympathetic to Wilde</span>
				<span class='text'>Of Wilde's other close friends, [[Robert Sherard]], [[Robbie Ross|Robert Ross]], his literary executor; and [[Charles Ricketts]] variously published biographies, reminiscences or correspondence</span>
				<span class='text'>The first more or less objective biography of Wilde came about when [[Hesketh Pearson]] wrote ''Oscar Wilde: His Life and Wit'' (1946)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Raby (1997:5)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954 [[Vyvyan Holland]] published his memoir ''Son of Oscar Wilde'', which recounts the difficulties Wilde's wife and children faced after his imprisonment</span>

				<span class='text'>'Oscar Wilde, a critical study'' by [[Arthur Ransome]] was published in 1912</span>
				<span class='text'>The book only briefly mentioned Wilde's life, but subsequently Ransome (and The Times Book Club) were sued for libel by [[Lord Alfred Douglas]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The trial in April 1913 was in a way a re-run of the trial(s) of Oscar Wilde</span>
