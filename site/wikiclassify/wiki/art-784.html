				<span class='text'>Berlioz considered this to be a good likeness</span>
				<span class='text'>]On 30 December 1831, Berlioz left France for Rome, prompted by a clause in the ''[[Prix de Rome]]'' which required winners to spend two years studying there</span>
				<span class='text'>Although none of his major works were actually written in Italy, his travels and experiences there would later influence and inspire much of his music</span>
				<span class='text'>This is most evident in the thematic aspects of his music, particularly ''[[Harold en Italie]]'' (1834), a work inspired by [[Lord Byron]]'s ''[[Childe Harold's Pilgrimage|Childe Harold]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Berlioz later recalled that his &quot;intention was to write a series of orchestral scenes, in which the solo viola would be involved as a more or less active participant [with the orchestra] while retaining its own character</span>
				<span class='text'>By placing it among the poetic memories formed from my wanderings in [[Abruzzo|Abruzzi]], I wanted to make the viola a kind of melancholy dreamer in the manner of Byron's Childe-Harold</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Memoirs'', 225</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;While in Rome, he stayed at the [[French Academy in Rome|French Academy]] in the [[Villa Medici]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He found the city distasteful, writing, &quot;Rome is the most stupid and prosaic city I know; it is no place for anyone with head or heart</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;eom&quot;/&gt; He therefore made an effort to leave the city as often as possible, making frequent trips into the surrounding country</span>
				<span class='text'>During one of these trips, while Berlioz enjoyed an afternoon of sailing, he encountered a group of [[Carbonari]]</span>
				<span class='text'>These were members of a secret society of Italian patriots based in France with the aim of creating a unified Italy</span>

				<span class='text'>Enraged, Berlioz decided to return to Paris and take revenge on Pleyel, his fiancée, and her mother by killing all three of them</span>
				<span class='text'>He created an elaborate plan, going so far as to purchase a dress, wig and hat with a veil (with which he was to disguise himself as a woman in order to gain entry to their home)</span>

				<span class='text'>espite this careful planning, Berlioz failed to carry the plot through</span>
				<span class='text'>By the time he had reached [[Genoa]], he &quot;left his disguise in the side pocket of the carriage&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;m3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ka&quot;/&gt; He was considered by [[Charles Hallé]], [[Hans von Bülow]] and others to be the greatest conductor of his era</span>

				<span class='text'>100&lt;/ref&gt; Berlioz initially began conducting due to frustrations over the inability of other conductors&amp;nbsp;– more used to performing older and simpler music&amp;nbsp;– to master his advanced and progressive works,&lt;ref name=&quot;dc18&quot;&gt;Cairns&amp;nbsp;– Berlioz vol</span>
				<span class='text'>2, p</span>
				<span class='text'>99&lt;/ref&gt; with their extended melodies&lt;ref name=&quot;fai&quot; /&gt; and rhythmic complexity</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ebr&quot;/&gt; He began with more enthusiasm than mastery,&lt;ref name=&quot;dc18&quot;/&gt; and was not formally trained,&lt;ref name=&quot;dc18&quot; /&gt; but through perseverance his skills improved</span>
				<span class='text'>He was also willing to take advice from others, as evidenced by [[Gaspare Spontini|Spontini]] criticising his early use of large gestures while conducting</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;dc17&quot; /&gt; One year later, according to [[Charles Hallé|Hallé]], his movements were much more economical, enabling him to control more nuance in the music</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;dc17&quot; /&gt; His expert understanding of the way the sound of each [[musical instrument|instrument]] interacts with each other (demonstrated in his ''[[Treatise on Instrumentation]]'') was attested to by the critic Louis Engel, who mentions how Berlioz once noticed, amidst an orchestral [[tutti]], a minute pitch difference between two [[clarinet]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;dc17&quot; /&gt; Engel offers an explanation of Berlioz's ability to detect such things as in part due to the sheer nervous energy he was experiencing during conducting</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;dc17&quot; /&gt;Despite this talent, Berlioz never held an employed position of conductor during his lifetime, forced to be content with only guest conducting</span>
				<span class='text'>This was almost not the case</span>
				<span class='text'>In late 1835, he was approached by the management of a new [[concert hall]] in Paris, the Gymnase Musical, and offered a position as their musical director</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;dc19&quot;&gt;Cairns&amp;nbsp;– Berlioz vol</span>
				<span class='text'>2, p</span>
				<span class='text'>101&lt;/ref&gt; To Berlioz this was an ideal opportunity</span>
				<span class='text'>Not only would it give him a large annual salary (between 6000 and 12,000 francs),&lt;ref name=&quot;dc19&quot; /&gt; but it would also give him a platform from which to perform his own music, and the music of fellow progressives</span>
				<span class='text'>Berlioz accepted the offer, and signed the contract for the position</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;dc19&quot;/&gt; However, a new decree issued by the revolutionary government forced him to change his mind</span>
				<span class='text'>The obstacle was one of the many restrictions that the revolutionary government had placed on the running of musical establishments, forbidding the performance of vocal music,&lt;ref name=&quot;dc19&quot;/&gt; so they did not compete with the influential Paris Opéra (among other organisations)</span>
				<span class='text'>There were passionate arguments and attempts to circumvent this restriction, but they fell on deaf ears, and the Gymnase Musical became a dance hall instead</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;dc19&quot; /&gt; This left Berlioz dejected, and would prove to have been a crucial cross-roads in his life, forcing him to work long hours as a critic, which severely impaired his free time available for composition</span>
				<span class='text'>rom then on, he conducted at many different occasions, but mainly during grand tours of various countries where he was paid handsomely for visiting</span>
				<span class='text'>In particular, towards the end of his life, he made a lot of money by touring Russia twice, the final visit proving extremely lucrative and also being the final conducting tour before his death</span>
				<span class='text'>This enabled him not only to perform his music to a wider audience, but also to increase his influence across Europe&amp;nbsp;– for example, his orchestration was studied by many Russian composers</span>
				<span class='text'>Not just fellow hyper-Romantic [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], but also members of [[The Five (composers)|The Five]] are indebted to these techniques, including [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]], but even [[Modest Mussorgsky]]&amp;nbsp;– often portrayed as uninterested in refined orchestration&amp;nbsp;– revered Berlioz&lt;ref name=&quot;dc20&quot;&gt;Cairns&amp;nbsp;– Berlioz vol</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;sc&quot;/&gt; Similarly, his conducting technique as described by contemporary sources appears to set the groundwork for the clarity and precision favoured in the French School of conducting right up to the present, exemplified by such figures as [[Pierre Monteux]], [[Désiré-Émile Inghelbrecht]], [[Paul Paray]], [[Charles Munch (conductor)|Charles Munch]], [[André Cluytens]], [[Pierre Boulez]] and [[Charles Dutoit]]</span>

				<span class='text'>rg]&lt;/ref&gt; The music of Berlioz enjoyed a revival during the 1960s and 1970s, due in large part to the efforts of French conductor [[Charles Munch (conductor)|Charles Munch]] and of British conductor Sir [[Colin Davis]], who recorded his entire [[work of art|oeuvre]], bringing to light a number of Berlioz's lesser-known works</span>
				<span class='text'>An unusual (but telling) example of the increase of Berlioz's fame in the 1960s was an explosion of forged [[autograph]]s, [[manuscript]]s, and [[letter (message)|letter]]s, evidently created to cater for a much greater interest in the composer</span>

				<span class='text'>=Influences==[[File:Berlioz engraving</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|upright|Hector Berlioz]]===Literature===Berlioz had a keen affection for literature, and many of his best compositions are inspired by literary works</span>
				<span class='text'>For ''[[Symphonie fantastique]]'', Berlioz was inspired in part by [[Thomas De Quincey]]'s ''[[Confessions of an English Opium-Eater]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>For ''[[La damnation de Faust]]'', Berlioz drew on [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe's]] ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]''; for ''[[Harold en Italie]]'', he drew on [[Lord Byron|Byron]]'s ''[[Childe Harold's Pilgrimage|Childe Harold]]''; for ''[[Benvenuto Cellini (opera)|Benvenuto Cellini]]'', he drew on [[Benvenuto Cellini|Cellini]]'s own autobiography</span>
				<span class='text'>For ''Roméo et Juliette'', Berlioz turned, of course, to Shakespeare's ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>For his [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]], the monumental opera ''[[Les Troyens]]'', Berlioz turned to Virgil's epic poem ''[[The Aeneid]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>In his last opera, the [[comic opera]] ''[[Béatrice et Bénédict]]'', Berlioz prepared a [[libretto]] based loosely on Shakespeare's ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>His composition &quot;[[Tristia (Berlioz)|Tristia]]&quot; (for orchestra and chorus) drew its inspiration from Shakespeare's ''[[Hamlet]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>===Shakespeare====In 1827, Berlioz watched Irish actress Harriet Smithson at the [[Odéon|Odéon theatre]] playing [[Ophelia]] and [[Juliet Capulet|Juliet]] in ''[[Hamlet]]'' and ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This led to two intense infatuations</span>
				<span class='text'>One was to Smithson, which would result in a disastrous marriage</span>
				<span class='text'>The other was to Shakespeare, which would become a lifelong love</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;nx&quot;/&gt; He followed the rest of the 1827 season closely, until the company moved to the Salle Favart, and began learning the plays from pocket translations on sale</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[D</span>
				<span class='text'>Kern Holoman|Holoman]], 46</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Though the performances were in English, of which Berlioz knew virtually none, he was still able to grasp the grandeur and sublimity of Shakespeare's language along with the richness of the plays' dramatic design</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;md2581&quot;&gt;MacDonald, &quot;Berlioz, (Louis-)Hector&quot;, ''New Grove'', 2:581</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The timing for these performances, not just for Berlioz' career but also for French Romanticism in general, could not have been more apt</span>
				<span class='text'>Berlioz was on the verge of producing his most Romantic works—as were the writers [[Alfred de Vigny|Vigny]], [[Alexandre Dumas, père|Dumas]], [[Théophile Gautier|Gautier]] and several others in attendance that night</span>
				<span class='text'>Shakespeare served as a model for French Romanticism,&lt;ref&gt;Holoman, 45</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; with Hugo extolling Shakespeare as a challenge to French classicism and the model for the new Romantic theater</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;md2581&quot;/&gt;Shakespeare for Berlioz represented the summit of poetic utterance, with the bard's veracity of dramatic expression and freedom from formal constraints resounding in the composer's spirit</span>
				<span class='text'>More profoundly, Shakespeare became a source, by way of its dramatic truth, for Berlioz' fundamental notion of expressive truth;&lt;ref name=&quot;md2581&quot;/&gt; this was how he could call ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' &quot;the supreme drama of my life</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Holoman, 46</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He read from the plays constantly, often aloud for anyone who would listen</span>
				<span class='text'>He quoted from them for the rest of his life and would associate any personal upheaval with its Shakespearian counterpart</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Holoman, 93</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Berlioz was especially taken with Shakespeare's ability to pinpoint the heart of a dramatic conflict and penetrating the secrets of intense love</span>
				<span class='text'>These secrets, Berlioz suggested in the text of ''[[Roméo et Juliette (Berlioz)|Roméo et Juliette]]'' the playwright took with him to heaven</span>
				<span class='text'>Time and again through the years, Berlioz would distill the favorite image of a play and distill it into musical terms</span>
				<span class='text'>''Roméo et Juliette'' may have been the first</span>
				<span class='text'>Later came ''The Tempest'', ''King Lear'', a funeral march for the final scene in ''Hamlet'', the love scene for ''Les Troyens'' (which, some claim, Berlioz took from ''The Merchant of Venice''), and ''Béatrice and Benedict''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Holoman, 92–93</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;====''Faust''====Berlioz discovered [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' through [[Gérard de Nerval]]'s translation, published in December 1827</span>
				<span class='text'>Its impact on Berlioz was, again, profound and immediate, with the Faustian concept of man striking several chords with the composer</span>
				<span class='text'>He described Shakespeare and Goethe in an 1828 letter as &quot;the silent confidants of my suffering; they hold the key to my life</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;md2582&quot;/&gt; In any event, Shakespearian tragedy and Faustian mystique became of one type in his mind</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Holoman, 92</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;====The Romantics====Simultaneous with Berlioz's discovery of Shakespeare was his immersion in the texts of true [[Romanticism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>These included the works of [[Thomas Moore]], Sir [[Walter Scott]] and [[Lord Byron]]</span>
				<span class='text'>All three inspired Berlioz to compose works based on theirs</span>
				<span class='text'>He also immersed himself in [[François-René de Chateaubriand|Chateaubriand]], [[E</span>
				<span class='text'>T</span>
				<span class='text'>A</span>
				<span class='text'>Hoffmann]], [[James Fenimore Cooper]] and his compatriots [[Victor Hugo]], [[Alfred de Vigny]], [[Alfred de Musset]] and [[Gérard de Nerval]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He later added [[Honoré de Balzac]], [[Gustave Flaubert]] and [[Théophile Gautier]] to his list of favorites; he also used Gautier's poems as texts for his song cycle ''Les nuits d'été''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''New Grove'', 2:582–3</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Perhaps as a result of this reading and seeing himself as an archetypical tragic hero, Berlioz began to weave personal references into his music</span>
				<span class='text'>It may in fact have been his love for Shakespeare, shared with the other young artist-heroes of 19th-century France, that drew Berlioz firmly into the brotherhood of Romanticism</span>
				<span class='text'>==Music=======Beethoven====Berlioz writes in his ''Memoirs'', {{quote|In an artist's life one thunderclap sometimes follows swiftly on another </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>I had just had the successive revelations of Shakespeare and Weber</span>
				<span class='text'>Now at another point on the horizon I saw the giant form of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] rear up</span>
				<span class='text'>The shock was almost as great as that of Shakespeare had been</span>
				<span class='text'>Beethoven opened before me a new world of music, as Shakespeare had revealed a new universe of poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;mem194&quot;&gt;''Memoirs'', 104</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;}}He was able to hear Beethoven's works through the performances of the ''Société des Concerts du Conservatoire'', an orchestra founded by [[François Antoine Habeneck]] and his colleagues to promote modern orchestral music</span>
				<span class='text'>The inaugural concert, on 9 March 1828, featured the French premiere of the [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>3 (Beethoven)|''Eroica'' Symphony]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Holoman, 48</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Despite protests from French and Italian composers,&lt;ref name=&quot;mem194&quot;&gt;''Memoirs'', 104</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; by the end of the first season Habeneck and the orchestra had also performed the [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphony]], the [[Piano Concerto No</span>
				<span class='text'>3 (Beethoven)|Third Piano Concerto]], the [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|Violin Concerto]] as well as other works</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Holoman, 48–49</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;For Berlioz the experience of hearing the ''Eroica'' brought the last and greatest revelation of the power of instrumental music as an expressive language, along with the freedom of action with which it could be expressive</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cairns, 1:265</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He understood at once that the symphony was a dramatic form to an extent that he had not previously realized,&lt;ref&gt;Cairns, 1:265–6</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and that in Beethoven he saw a way to the dramatic manner in which he desired to compose</span>
				<span class='text'>ost tellingly, hearing the ''Eroica'' inspired Berlioz to widen his horizons for the first time past opera and other vocal works and consider the expressive power of purely instrumental music</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=md2582&gt;MacDonald, ''New Grove'', 2:582</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this, he had defaulted to the dominant view of the Parisian music establishment, as typified by [[Jean-François Le Sueur|Le Sueur]]: that the symphony was a lesser form of composition that [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] had already taken as far as possible</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cairns, 1:261</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Berlioz would go on to find instrumental music to be far more penetrating in expression and articulation than vocal setting</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;md2582&quot;/&gt; &quot;Now that I have heard that terrifying giant Beethoven&quot;, he wrote, &quot;I know exactly where my musical art stands; the question is to take it from there and push it further</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Holoway, 93</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;====Other composers====Next to those of Beethoven, Berlioz showed deep reverence for the works of [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Étienne Méhul|Méhul]], [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]] and [[Gaspare Spontini|Spontini]], as well as respect for some of those of [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]], [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]] and [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]</span>
				<span class='text'>he innovative use of chromaticism by his contemporaries and associates [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]] and Wagner had little effect on Berlioz's style</span>
				<span class='text'>uring his second visit to Russia in 1867, Berlioz met composer and pianist [[Anton Rubinstein]], the director and founder of the [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory]] (he left his position that August to live in Germany)</span>
				<span class='text'>Other Russian composers he knew or at least had met include Mussorgsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, [[Vladimir Stasov]], and Tchaikovsky</span>

				<span class='text'>His talent in the genre is obvious, but opera is the most expensive of all [[classical music|classical]] forms, and Berlioz in particular struggled to arrange stagings of his operas, due in part to the unwillingness of conservative Paris opera companies to perform his work</span>

				<span class='text'>{Which|date=January 2010}} During the middle of the 1830s the ''Gazette'' was considered an intellectual journal, strongly supporting the progressive arts and [[Romanticism]] in general, and opposing anything which it considers as debasing this</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;dc21&quot;/&gt; Exemplified in its long-standing criticism of [[Henri Herz]], and his seemingly endless stream of variations on opera themes, but to its credit, it also positively reviewed his music on occasion</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;dc21&quot;/&gt; The ''Gazette'' wasn't even unanimous in its praise of Berlioz's music, although it always recognised him as an important and serious composer to be respected</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;dc22&quot;/&gt; An example of another journal of the same time is the ''Revue musicale'', which thrived on personal attacks, many against Berlioz himself from the pen of critic [[François-Joseph Fétis]]</span>
