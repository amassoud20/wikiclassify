				<span class='text'>He is known mostly for his discovery that water is made of two parts hydrogen and one part oxygen (with [[Alexander von Humboldt]]), for [[Gay-Lussac's law|two laws]] related to [[gas]]es, and for his work on alcohol-water mixtures, which led to the [[degrees Gay-Lussac]] used to measure alcoholic beverages in many countries</span>
				<span class='text'>= Biography ==Gay-Lussac was born at [[Saint-Léonard-de-Noblat]] in the present-day department of [[Haute-Vienne]]</span>
				<span class='text'>he father of Joseph Louis Gay, Anthony Gay, son of a doctor, was a lawyer and prosecutor, and worked as a judge in Noblat Bridge</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Biographical Dictionary Ancient and Modern, Volume 16, Michaud&lt;/ref&gt; Father of two sons and three daughters, he owned much of the Lussac village  and usually added the name of this hamlet of the [[Haute-Vienne]] to his name, following a custom of the [[Ancien Régime]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Towards the year 1803, father and son finally adopted the name Gay-Lussac</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Biographical sketch by Gay de Vernon&lt;/ref&gt; During the Revolution, on behalf of the [[Law of Suspects]], his father, former king's attorney, was imprisoned in  Saint Léonard from 1793 to 1794</span>
				<span class='text'>e received his early education at the hands of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Abbey of Bourdeix</span>
				<span class='text'>Later, in the care of the Abbot of Dumonteil he began his education in Paris, finally entering the [[École Polytechnique]] in 1798</span>
				<span class='text'>Gay-Lussac narrowly avoided conscription and by the time of entry to the École Polytechnique his father had been arrested (due to [[Robespierre]]'s [[Reign of Terror]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Three years later, Gay-Lussac transferred to the [[École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées|École des Ponts et Chaussées]], and shortly afterwards was assigned to [[C</span>

				<span class='text'>From 1808 to 1832, he was professor of physics at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], a post which he only resigned for the chair of chemistry at the [[Jardin des Plantes]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1821, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1831 he was elected to represent [[Haute-Vienne]] in the chamber of deputies, and in 1839 he entered the chamber of peers</span>
				<span class='text'>ay-Lussac married Geneviève-Marie-Joseph Rojot in 1809</span>
				<span class='text'>He had first met her when she worked as a linen draper's shop assistant and was studying a chemistry textbook under the counter</span>
				<span class='text'>He fathered five children, of whom the eldest (Jules) became assistant to [[Justus Liebig]] in Giessen</span>
				<span class='text'>Some publications by Jules are mistaken as his father's today since they share the same first initial (J</span>

				<span class='text'>Illustration from the late 19th century</span>
				<span class='text'>]* 1802 – Gay-Lussac first formulated the law, [[Gay-Lussac's Law]], stating that if the mass and volume of a gas are held constant then gas pressure increases linearly as the temperature rises</span>
				<span class='text'>His work was preceded by that of [[Guillaume Amontons]], who established the rough relation without the use of accurate [[thermometers]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The law is sometimes written as P = k T, where k is a constant dependent on the mass and volume of the gas and T is temperature on an absolute scale (in terms of the [[ideal gas law]], k = n·R/V)</span>
				<span class='text'> 1804 – He and [[Jean-Baptiste Biot]] made a [[hot-air balloon]] ascent to a height of {{convert|7016|m|ft}} in an early investigation of the [[Earth's atmosphere]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He wanted to collect samples of the air at different heights to record differences in temperature and moisture</span>
				<span class='text'> 1805 – Together with his friend and scientific collaborator [[Alexander von Humboldt]], he discovered that the composition of the atmosphere does not change with decreasing pressure (increasing altitude)</span>
				<span class='text'>They also discovered that water is formed by two parts of hydrogen and one part of oxygen (by volume)</span>
				<span class='text'> 1808 – He was the co-discoverer of [[boron]]</span>
				<span class='text'> 1810 – In collaboration with [[Louis Jacques Thénard|Louis Thenard]], he developed a method for quantitative elemental analysis by measuring the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolved by reaction with potassium chlorate</span>
				<span class='text'> 1811 – He recognized [[iodine]] as a new element, described its properties, and suggested the name ''iode''</span>
