				<span class='text'>He had one brother, [[Pierre-Antoine Cousteau|Pierre-Antoine]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Cousteau completed his preparatory studies at the [[Collège Stanislas de Paris|Collège Stanislas]] in Paris</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1930, he entered the [[École Navale]] and graduated as a gunnery officer</span>
				<span class='text'>After an automobile accident cut short his career in naval aviation, Cousteau indulged his interest in the sea</span>
				<span class='text'>n [[Toulon]], where he was serving on the ''Condorcet'', Cousteau carried out his first underwater experiments, thanks to his friend [[Philippe Tailliez]] who in 1936 lent him some [[Maurice Fernez|Fernez]] underwater [[goggle]]s, predecessors of modern [[swimming goggles]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;cousteau1&quot;/&gt; Cousteau also belonged to the information service of the [[French Navy]], and was sent on missions to Shanghai and Japan (1935–1938) and in the [[USSR]] (1939)</span>

				<span class='text'>His sons took part in the adventures of the ''[[Calypso (ship)|Calypso]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1991, one year after his wife Simone's death from cancer, he married [[Francine Cousteau|Francine Triplet]]</span>
				<span class='text'>They already had a daughter Diane Cousteau (born 1980) and a son Pierre-Yves Cousteau (born 1982), born during Cousteau's marriage to his first wife</span>
				<span class='text'>==Early 1940s: Innovation of modern underwater diving===The years of [[World War II]] were decisive for the history of diving</span>
				<span class='text'>After the [[Armistice with France (Second Compiègne)|armistice of 1940]], the family of Simone and Jacques-Yves Cousteau took refuge in [[Megève]], where he became a friend of the Ichac family who also lived there</span>
				<span class='text'>Jacques-Yves Cousteau and Marcel Ichac shared the same desire to reveal to the general public unknown and inaccessible places&amp;nbsp;— for Cousteau the underwater world and for Ichac the high mountains</span>
				<span class='text'>The two neighbors took the first [[ex-aequo]] prize of the [[Congress of Documentary Film]] in 1943, for the first French underwater film: ''Par dix-huit mètres de fond'' (''18 meters deep''), made without breathing apparatus the previous year in the [[List of islands of France|Embiez]] islands ([[Var (department)|Var]]) with [[Philippe Tailliez]] and [[Frédéric Dumas]], using a depth-pressure-proof camera case developed by mechanical engineer Léon Vèche (engineer of Arts and Métiers and the Naval College)</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1943, they made the film ''Épaves'' (''Shipwrecks''), in which they used two of the very first [[Aqua-Lung]] prototypes</span>

				<span class='text'>At that time, he kept his distance from his brother [[Pierre-Antoine Cousteau]], a &quot;pen anti-semite&quot; who wrote the collaborationist newspaper ''Je suis partout'' (''I am everywhere'') and who received the death sentence in 1946</span>
				<span class='text'>However, this was later commuted to a life sentence, and Pierre-Antoine was released in 1954</span>
				<span class='text'>uring the 1940s, Cousteau is credited with improving the aqua-lung design which gave birth to the [[open-circuit scuba]] technology used today</span>
				<span class='text'>According to his first book, ''[[The Silent World: A Story of Undersea Discovery and Adventure]]'' (1953), Cousteau started diving with [[Maurice Fernez|Fernez]] goggles in 1936, and in 1939 used the self-contained underwater breathing apparatus invented in 1926 by [[Yves le Prieur|Commander Yves le Prieur]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Cousteau was not satisfied with the length of time he could spend underwater with the Le Prieur apparatus so he improved it to extend underwater duration by adding a [[demand regulator]], invented in 1942 by Émile Gagnan</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; In 1943 Cousteau tried out the first prototype [[aqua-lung]] which finally made extended underwater exploration possible</span>
				<span class='text'>==Late 1940s: GERS and ''Élie Monnier''===In 1946, Cousteau and Tailliez showed the film &quot;Épaves&quot; to Admiral Lemonnier, and the admiral gave them the responsibility of setting up the Groupement de Recherches Sous-marines (GRS) (Underwater Research Group) of the [[French Navy]] in [[Toulon]]</span>
				<span class='text'>A little later it became the GERS (Groupe d'Études et de Recherches Sous-Marines, = Underwater Studies and Research Group), then the COMISMER (&quot;COMmandement des Interventions Sous la MER&quot;, = &quot;Undersea Interventions Command&quot;), and finally more recently the CEPHISMER</span>

				<span class='text'>The small team also undertook the exploration of the Roman wreck of Mahdia (Tunisia)</span>
				<span class='text'>It was the first underwater archaeology operation using autonomous diving, opening the way for scientific underwater archaeology</span>
				<span class='text'>Cousteau and Marcel Ichac brought back from there the Carnets diving film (presented and preceded with the [[Cannes Film Festival]] 1951)</span>
				<span class='text'>ousteau and the ''Élie Monnier'' then took part in the rescue of Professor [[Jacques Piccard]]'s [[bathyscaphe]], the [[FNRS-2]], during the 1949 expedition to Dakar</span>
				<span class='text'>Thanks to this rescue, the French Navy was able to reuse the sphere of the bathyscaphe to construct the [[FNRS-3]]</span>
				<span class='text'>he adventures of this period are told in the two books ''[[The Silent World: A Story of Undersea Discovery and Adventure|The Silent World]]'' (1953, by Cousteau and Dumas) and ''Plongées sans câble'' (1954, by [[Philippe Tailliez]])</span>
				<span class='text'>==1950–1970s===In 1949, Cousteau left the [[French Navy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1950, he founded the French Oceanographic Campaigns (FOC), and leased a ship called [[Calypso (ship)|''Calypso'']] from [[Thomas Loel Guinness]] for a symbolic one franc a year</span>
				<span class='text'>Cousteau refitted the ''Calypso'' as a mobile laboratory for field research and as his principal vessel for diving and filming</span>
				<span class='text'>He also carried out underwater archaeological excavations in the Mediterranean, in particular at [[Grand-Congloué]] (1952)</span>
				<span class='text'>ith the publication of his first book in 1953, ''[[The Silent World: A Story of Undersea Discovery and Adventure|The Silent World]]'', he correctly predicted the existence of the [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]] abilities of [[porpoises]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He reported that his research vessel, the ''Élie Monier,'' was heading to the [[Straits of Gibraltar]] and noticed a group of porpoises following them</span>
				<span class='text'>Cousteau changed course a few degrees off the optimal course to the center of the strait, and the porpoises followed for a few minutes, then diverged toward mid-channel again</span>
				<span class='text'>It was evident that they knew where the optimal course lay, even if the humans did not</span>
				<span class='text'>Cousteau concluded that the cetaceans had something like [[sonar]], which was a relatively new feature on [[submarines]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ousteau won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 1956 for ''[[The Silent World]]'' co-produced with [[Louis Malle]]</span>
				<span class='text'>With the assistance of Jean Mollard, he made a [[SP-350 Denise|&quot;diving saucer&quot; SP-350]], an experimental underwater vehicle which could reach a depth of 350 meters</span>
				<span class='text'>The successful experiment was quickly repeated in 1965 with two vehicles which reached 500 meters</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1957, he was elected as director of the [[Oceanographic Museum|Oceanographical Museum of Monaco]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He directed Précontinent, about the experiments of diving in saturation (long-duration immersion, houses under the sea), and was admitted to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]]</span>

				<span class='text'>The CEA argued that the dumps were experimental in nature, and that French oceanographers such as [[Vsevelod Romanovsky]] had recommended it</span>
				<span class='text'>Romanovsky and other French scientists, including [[Louis Fage]] and Jacques Cousteau, repudiated the claim, saying that Romanovsky had in mind a much smaller amount</span>
				<span class='text'>The CEA claimed that there was little circulation (and hence little need for concern) at the dump site between Nice and Corsica, but French public opinion sided with the oceanographers rather than with the CEA atomic energy scientists</span>
				<span class='text'>The CEA chief, [[Francis Perrin]], decided to postpone the dump</span>

				<span class='text'>]A meeting with American television companies ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[Metromedia|Métromédia]], [[NBC]]) created the series ''[[The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau]]'', with the character of the commander in the red bonnet inherited from [[standard diving dress]]) intended to give the films a &quot;personalized adventure&quot; style</span>
				<span class='text'>This documentary television series ran for ten years from 1966 to 1976</span>
				<span class='text'>A second documentary series, ''The Cousteau Odyssey'', ran from 1977 to 1982, among others</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1970, he wrote the book ''The Shark: Splendid Savage of the Sea'' with his son Philippe</span>
				<span class='text'>In this book, Costeau described the [[oceanic whitetip shark]] as &quot;the most dangerous of all sharks&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1973, along with his two sons and Frederick Hyman, he created the Cousteau Society for the Protection of Ocean Life, Frederick Hyman being its first President; it now has more than 300,000 members</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1975, [[John Denver]] released the tribute song &quot;Calypso&quot; on his album &quot;Windsong&quot;, and on the B-side of his hit song &quot;I'm Sorry&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'> &quot;Calypso&quot; became a hit on its own and was later considered the new A-side, reaching #2 on the charts</span>
				<span class='text'>n December 1975, two years after the volcano's last eruption, The Cousteau Society was filming ''[[Voyage to the Edge of the World|Voyage au bout du monde]]'' on [[Deception Island]], Antarctica, when Michel Laval, ''Calypso'''s second in command, was struck and killed by a rotor of the helicopter that was ferrying between ''Calypso'' and the island</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1976, Cousteau uncovered the wreck of [[HMHS Britannic|HMHS ''Britannic'']]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also found the wreck of the French 17th-century ship-of-the-line ''[[La Therese (ship)|La Therese]]'' in coastal waters of [[Crete]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1977, together with [[Peter Scott]], he received the UN International Environment prize</span>
				<span class='text'>n 28 June 1979, while the ''Calypso'' was on an expedition to [[Portugal]], his second son Philippe, his preferred and designated successor and with whom he had co-produced all his films since 1969, died in a [[Consolidated PBY Catalina|PBY Catalina]] flying boat crash in the Tagus river near Lisbon</span>
				<span class='text'>Cousteau was deeply affected</span>
				<span class='text'>He called his then eldest son, the architect Jean-Michel, to his side</span>

				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|Cousteau's submarine near Oceanographic Museum in Monaco]]Cousteau's legacy includes more than 120 television documentaries, more than 50 books, and an environmental protection foundation with 300,000 members</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;cousteau1&quot;/&gt;Cousteau liked to call himself an &quot;oceanographic technician</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He was, in reality, a sophisticated showman, teacher, and lover of nature</span>
				<span class='text'>His work permitted many people to explore the resources of the oceans</span>
				<span class='text'>is work also created a new kind of scientific communication, criticised at the time by some academics</span>
				<span class='text'>The so-called &quot;[[divulgation]]ism&quot;, a simple way of sharing scientific concepts, was soon employed in other disciplines and became one of the most important characteristics of modern television broadcasting</span>
				<span class='text'>he Cousteau Society and its French counterpart, l'Équipe Cousteau, both of which Jacques-Yves Cousteau founded, are still active today</span>
				<span class='text'>The Society is currently attempting to turn the original [[RV Calypso|''Calypso'']] into a museum and it is raising funds to build a successor vessel, the ''Calypso II''</span>
				<span class='text'>n his last years, after marrying again, Cousteau became involved in a legal battle with his son [[Jean-Michel Cousteau|Jean-Michel]] over Jean-Michel licensing the Cousteau name for a South Pacific resort, resulting in Jean-Michel Cousteau being ordered by the court not to encourage confusion between his for-profit business and his father's non-profit endeavours</span>
				<span class='text'>n 2007, the [[International Watch Company]] introduced the IWC Aquatimer Chronograph &quot;Cousteau Divers&quot; Special Edition</span>
				<span class='text'>The timepiece incorporated a sliver of wood from the interior of Cousteau's Calypso research vessel</span>
				<span class='text'>Having developed the diver's watch, IWC offered support to The Cousteau Society</span>
				<span class='text'>The proceeds from the timepieces' sales were partially donated to the non-profit organization involved into conservation of marine life and preservation of tropical coral reefs</span>
