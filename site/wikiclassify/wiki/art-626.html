				<span class='text'>He was elected [[King of Germany]] at [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]] on 4&amp;nbsp;March 1152 and crowned in [[Aachen]] on 9&amp;nbsp;March 1152</span>
				<span class='text'>He became [[King of Italy]] in 1155 and was crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor|Roman Emperor]] by [[Pope Adrian&amp;nbsp;IV]] on 18&amp;nbsp;June 1155</span>
				<span class='text'> Two years later, the term ''sacrum'' (&quot;holy&quot;) first appeared in a document in connection with his Empire</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Peter Moraw, ''Heiliges Reich'', in: ''Lexikon des Mittelalters'', Munich &amp; Zurich: Artemis 1977–1999, vol</span>
				<span class='text'>4,  2025–2028</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He was later formally crowned [[King of Burgundy]], at [[Arles]] on 30 June 1178</span>
				<span class='text'>He got the name ''Barbarossa'' from the northern Italian cities he attempted to rule: Barbarossa means &quot;red beard&quot; in [[Italian language|Italian]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>263&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Canduci|2010|p=263}}&lt;/ref&gt; in German, he was known as ''Kaiser Rotbart'', which has the same meaning</span>
				<span class='text'>efore his imperial election, Frederick was by inheritance [[Duke of Swabia]] (1147–1152, as Frederick III)</span>
				<span class='text'>He was the son of [[Frederick II, Duke of Swabia|Duke Frederick&amp;nbsp;II]] of the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] dynasty and [[Judith of Bavaria, Duchess of Swabia|Judith]], daughter of [[Henry&amp;nbsp;IX, Duke of Bavaria]], from the rival [[House of Welf]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Frederick therefore descended from the two leading families in Germany, making him an acceptable choice for the Empire's [[prince-elector]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>istorians consider him among the Holy Roman Empire's greatest medieval emperors</span>
				<span class='text'>He combined qualities that made him appear almost superhuman to his contemporaries: his longevity, his ambition, his extraordinary skills at organization, his battlefield acumen and his political perspicuity</span>
				<span class='text'>Among his contributions to Central European society and culture include the reestablishment of the [[Corpus Juris Civilis]], or the Roman rule of law, which counterbalanced the papal power that dominated the German states since the conclusion of the [[Investiture controversy|investiture crisis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Life and reign=====Early years===Frederick was born in 1122</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1147 he became Duke of the southern German region of Swabia (Herzog von Schwaben), and shortly afterwards made his first trip to the East, accompanied by his uncle, the German king [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad III]], on the [[Second Crusade]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The expedition proved to be a disaster,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Comyn|1851|p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Frederick distinguished himself and won the complete confidence of the king</span>
				<span class='text'>When Conrad died in February 1152, only Frederick and the [[Bishop of Bamberg|prince-bishop of Bamberg]] were at his deathbed</span>
				<span class='text'>Both asserted afterwards that Conrad had, in full possession of his mental powers, handed the royal insignia to Frederick and indicated that Frederick, rather than Conrad's own six-year-old son, the future [[Frederick IV, Duke of Swabia]], succeed him as king</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Comyn, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>200&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Comyn|1851|p=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frederick energetically pursued the crown and at [[Frankfurt]] on 4 March 1152 the kingdom's [[Prince-elector|princely electors]] designated him as the next German king</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Comyn, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>200&quot;/&gt; He was crowned [[King of the Romans]] at [[Aachen]] several days later, on 9 March 1152</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Le Goff|2000|p=266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frederick's father was from the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] family, and his mother was from the [[House of Welf|Welf]] family, the two most powerful families in Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>The Hohenstaufens were often called [[Ghibellines]], which derives from the Italianized name for [[Waiblingen]] castle, the family seat in Swabia; the Welfs, in a similar Italianization, were called [[Guelfs]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dahmus|1969|pp=300–302}}&lt;/ref&gt;The reigns of [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]] left the status of the German empire in disarray, its power waning under the weight of the [[Investiture controversy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>For a quarter of a century following the death of Henry V in 1125, the German monarchy was largely a nominal title with no real power</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bryce|1913|p=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; The king was chosen by the princes, was given no resources outside those of his own duchy, and he was prevented from exercising any real authority or leadership in the realm</span>
				<span class='text'>The royal title was furthermore passed from one family to another to preclude the development of any dynastic interest in the German crown</span>
				<span class='text'>When Frederick I of Hohenstaufen was chosen as king in 1152, royal power had been in effective abeyance for over twenty-five years, and to a considerable degree for more than eighty years</span>
				<span class='text'>The only real claim to wealth lay in the rich cities of northern Italy, which were still within the nominal control of the German king</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Cantor|1969|pp=302–303}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Salian line had died out with the death of Henry V in 1125</span>
				<span class='text'>The German princes refused to give the crown to his nephew, the duke of Swabia, for fear he would try to regain the imperial power held by Henry V</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, they chose [[Lothair III, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothair III]] (1125–1137), who found himself embroiled in a long-running dispute with the Hohenstaufens, and who married into the Welfs</span>
				<span class='text'>One of the Hohenstaufens gained the throne as [[Conrad III of Germany]] (1137–1152)</span>
				<span class='text'>When Frederick Barbarossa succeeded his uncle in 1152, there seemed to be excellent prospects for ending the feud, since he was a Welf on his mother's side</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Comyn, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>200&quot;/&gt; The Welf duke of Saxony, [[Henry the Lion]], would not be appeased, however, remaining an implacable enemy of the Hohenstaufen monarchy</span>
				<span class='text'>Barbarossa had the duchies of Swabia and Franconia, the force of his own personality, and very little else to construct an empire</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Cantor|1969|pp=428–429}}&lt;/ref&gt;The Germany that Frederick tried to unite was a patchwork of more than 1600 individual states, each with its own prince</span>
				<span class='text'>A few of these, such as Bavaria and Saxony, were large</span>
				<span class='text'>Many were too small to pinpoint on a map</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dahmus|1969|p=359}}&lt;/ref&gt; The titles afforded to the German king were &quot;Caesar&quot;, &quot;Augustus&quot;, and &quot;Emperor of the Romans&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>By the time Frederick would assume these, they were little more than propaganda slogans with little other meaning</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Brown|1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frederick was a pragmatist who dealt with the princes by finding a mutual self-interest</span>
				<span class='text'>Unlike [[Henry II of England]], Frederick did not attempt to end medieval feudalism, but rather tried to restore it, though this was beyond his ability</span>
				<span class='text'>The great players in the German civil war had been the Pope, Emperor, Ghibellines, and the Guelfs, but none of these had emerged as the winner</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Davis|1957|pp=318–319}}&lt;/ref&gt;===Rise to power===[[File:Keizer Frederik I Barbarossa penning 1152-1190 geslagen Nijmegen</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|260px|[[Penny]] or denier with Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa, struck in [[Nijmegen]]</span>
				<span class='text'>]Eager to restore the Empire to the position it had occupied under [[Charlemagne]] and [[Otto I the Great]], the new king saw clearly that the restoration of order in Germany was a necessary preliminary to the enforcement of the imperial rights in Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>Issuing a general order for peace, he made lavish concessions to the nobles</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Comyn|1851|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Abroad, Frederick intervened in the Danish civil war between [[Svend III of Denmark|Svend III]] and [[Valdemar I of Denmark]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Comyn|1851|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; and began negotiations with the Eastern Roman Emperor, [[Manuel I Comnenus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Comyn, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>230&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Comyn|1851|p=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was probably about this time that the king obtained papal assent for the annulment of his childless marriage with [[Adelheid of Vohburg]], on the grounds of [[consanguinity]] (his great-great-grandfather was a brother of Adela's great-great-great-grandmother, making them fourth cousins, once removed)</span>
				<span class='text'>He then made a vain effort to obtain a bride from the court of Constantinople</span>
				<span class='text'>On his accession Frederick had communicated the news of his election to [[Pope Eugene III]], but had neglected to ask for the papal confirmation</span>
				<span class='text'>In March 1153, Frederick concluded the treaty of Constance with the Pope, whereby he promised, in return for his coronation, to defend the papacy, to make no peace with king [[Roger II of Sicily]] or other enemies of the Church without the consent of Eugene, and to help Eugene regain control of the city of Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Falco|1964|pp=218 et seq</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt;===First Italian Campaign: 1154–55===Frederick undertook six expeditions into Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>In the first, beginning in October 1154,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Comyn|1851|p=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; his plan was to launch a campaign against the [[Normans]] under King [[William&amp;nbsp;I of Sicily]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Comyn, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>230&quot;/&gt; He marched down and almost immediately encountered resistance to his authority</span>
				<span class='text'>Obtaining the submission of [[Milan]], he successfully besieged [[Tortona]] in early 1155, razing it to the ground</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Comyn|1851|p=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved on to [[Pavia]], where he received the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy|Iron Crown]] and the title of [[King of Italy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Comyn|1851|p=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moving through [[Bologna]] and [[Tuscany]], he was soon approaching the city of Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>There, [[Pope Adrian&amp;nbsp;IV]] was struggling with the forces of the republican city commune led by [[Arnold of Brescia]], a student of [[Abelard]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>263&quot;/&gt; As a sign of good faith, Frederick dismissed the ambassadors from the revived Roman Senate,&lt;ref name=&quot;Comyn, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>230&quot;/&gt; and Imperial forces suppressed the republicans</span>
				<span class='text'>Arnold was captured and hanged for treason and rebellion</span>
				<span class='text'> Despite his unorthodox teaching concerning theology, Arnold was not charged with heresy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Cantor|1969|pp=368–369}}&lt;/ref&gt;As Frederick approached the gates of Rome, the Pope advanced to meet him</span>
				<span class='text'>At the royal tent the king received him, and after kissing the pope's feet, Frederick expected to receive the traditional kiss of peace</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Comyn, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>231&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Comyn|1851|p=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frederick had declined to hold the Pope's stirrup while leading him to the tent, however, so Adrian refused to give the kiss until this protocol had been complied with</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>263&quot;/&gt; Frederick hesitated, and Adrian&amp;nbsp;IV withdrew; after a day's negotiation, Frederick agreed to perform the required ritual, reportedly muttering, &quot;''Pro Petro, non Adriano'' -- For Peter, not for Adrian</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Comyn, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>231&quot;/&gt;  Rome was still in an uproar over the fate of Arnold of Brescia, so rather than marching through the streets of Rome, Frederick and Adrian retired to the [[Holy See|Vatican]]</span>
				<span class='text'>he next day, 18 June 1155, Adrian&amp;nbsp;IV crowned Frederick I [[Holy Roman Emperor]] at [[St Peter's Basilica]], amidst the acclamations of the German army</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Comyn, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>232&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Comyn|1851|p=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans began to riot, and Frederick spent his coronation day putting down the revolt, resulting in the deaths of over 1,000 Romans and many more thousands injured</span>
				<span class='text'>The next day, Frederick, Adrian, and the German army travelled to [[Tivoli, Italy|Tivoli]]</span>
				<span class='text'>From there, a combination of the unhealthy Italian summer and the effects of his year-long absence from Germany meant he was forced to put off his planned campaign against the Normans of [[Sicily]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Comyn, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>232&quot;/&gt;  On their way northwards, they attacked [[Spoleto]] and encountered the ambassadors of Manuel&amp;nbsp;I Comnenus, who showered Frederick with costly gifts</span>
				<span class='text'>At [[Verona]], Frederick declared his fury with the rebellious Milanese before finally returning to Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Comyn|1851|p=233}}&lt;/ref&gt;Disorder was again rampant in Germany, especially in Bavaria, but general peace was restored by Frederick's vigorous, but conciliatory, measures</span>
				<span class='text'> The duchy of Bavaria was transferred from [[Henry II of Austria|Henry&amp;nbsp;II Jasomirgott]], margrave of Austria, to Frederick's formidable younger cousin [[Henry the Lion]], [[Duke of Saxony]], of the [[House of Guelph]], whose father had previously held both duchies</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Comyn|1851|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry&amp;nbsp;II Jasomirgott was named [[Duke of Austria]] in compensation for his loss of Bavaria</span>
				<span class='text'>As part of his general policy of concessions of formal power to the German princes and ending the civil wars within the kingdom, Frederick further appeased Henry by issuing him with the [[Privilegium Minus]], granting him unprecedented entitlements as [[Duke of Austria]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This was a large concession on the part of Frederick, who realized that Henry the Lion had to be accommodated, even to the point of sharing some power with him</span>
				<span class='text'>Frederick could not afford to make an outright enemy of Henry</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Davis|1957|p=319}}&lt;/ref&gt;On 9 June 1156 at [[Würzburg]], Frederick married [[Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy|Beatrice of Burgundy]], daughter and heiress of [[Renaud III, Count of Burgundy|Renaud&amp;nbsp;III]], thus adding to his possessions the sizeable realm of the [[County of Burgundy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In an attempt to create comity, Emperor Frederick proclaimed the [[Peace of the Land]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Frederick Barbarossa in a 13th-century chronicle]]The retreat of Frederick in 1155 forced Pope Adrian&amp;nbsp;IV to come to terms with King William&amp;nbsp;I of Sicily, granting to William&amp;nbsp;I territories that Frederick viewed as his dominion</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite Catholic Encyclopedia|wstitle=Pope Adrian IV |first=Arthur |last=Ua Clerigh}}&lt;/ref&gt; This aggrieved Frederick, and he was further displeased when [[Papal Legate]]s chose to interpret a letter from Adrian to Frederick in a manner that seemed to imply that the imperial crown was a gift from the [[Papacy]] and that in fact the Empire itself was a [[fief]] of the Papacy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Comyn|1851|p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disgusted with the pope, and still wishing to crush the Normans in the south of Italy, in June 1158, Frederick set out upon his second Italian expedition, accompanied by Henry the Lion and his Saxon troops</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Comyn|1851|p=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This expedition resulted in the revolt and capture of [[Milan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Comyn|1851|p=238}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Diet of Roncaglia]] that saw the establishment of imperial officers and ecclesiastical reforms in the cities of northern Italy,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Comyn|1851|p=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the beginning of the long struggle with [[Pope Alexander&amp;nbsp;III]]</span>
				<span class='text'>he death of Pope Adrian IV in 1159 led to the election of two rival popes, Alexander&amp;nbsp;III and the [[antipope]] [[Antipope Victor IV (1159–1164)|Victor&amp;nbsp;IV]], and both sought Frederick's support</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Comyn|1851|p=241}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frederick, busy with the [[siege of Crema]], appeared unsupportive of Alexander&amp;nbsp;III, and after the sacking of Crema demanded that Alexander appear before the emperor at Pavia and to accept the imperial decree</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Comyn|1851|p=242}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander refused, and Frederick recognised Victor IV as the legitimate pope in 1160</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Comyn, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>243&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Comyn|1851|p=243}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, Alexander III [[excommunication|excommunicated]] both Frederick&amp;nbsp;I and Victor&amp;nbsp;IV</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dahmus|1969|p=295}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frederick attempted to convoke a joint council with King [[Louis&amp;nbsp;VII of France]] in 1162 to decide the issue of who should be pope</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Comyn, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>243&quot;/&gt; Louis neared the meeting site, but when he became aware that Frederick had stacked the votes for Alexander, Louis decided not to attend the council</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, the issue was not resolved at that time</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Munz|1969|p=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;The political result of the struggle with Pope Alexander was an alliance formed between the Norman state of Sicily and Pope Alexander&amp;nbsp;III against Frederick</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Davis|1957|pp=326–327}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, Frederick had to deal with another rebellion at Milan, in which the city surrendered on 6 March 1162; much of it was destroyed three weeks later on the emperor's orders</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Comyn|1851|p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fate of Milan led to the submission of [[Brescia]], [[Placentia, Italy|Placentia]], and many other northern Italian cities</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Comyn|1851|p=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to Germany towards the close of 1162, Frederick prevented the escalation of conflicts between Henry the Lion from Saxony and a number of neighbouring princes who were growing weary of Henry's power, influence, and territorial gains</span>
				<span class='text'>He also severely punished the citizens of [[Mainz]] for their rebellion against Archbishop Arnold</span>
				<span class='text'>In Frederick's third visit to Italy in 1163, his plans for the conquest of [[Sicily]] were ruined by the formation of a powerful league against him, brought together mainly by opposition to imperial taxes</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1164 Frederick took what are believed to be the [[relics]] of the &quot;Biblical Magi&quot; (the Wise Men or [[Three Kings]]) from the [[Basilica di Sant'Eustorgio]] in [[Milan]] and gave them as a gift (or as loot) to the [[List of bishops and archbishops of Cologne|Archbishop of Cologne]], [[Rainald of Dassel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The relics had great religious significance and could be counted upon to draw pilgrims from all over [[Christendom]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Today they are kept in the [[Shrine of the Three Kings]] in the [[Cologne cathedral]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After the death of the antipope Victor&amp;nbsp;IV, Frederick supported antipope [[Antipope Paschal III|Paschal&amp;nbsp;III]], but he was soon driven from Rome, leading to the return of Pope Alexander&amp;nbsp;III in 1165</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Comyn|1851|p=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;In the meantime Frederick was focused on restoring peace in the Rhineland, where he organized a magnificent celebration of the [[canonization]] of Charles the Great ([[Charlemagne]]) at Aachen, under the authority of the antipope Paschal&amp;nbsp;III</span>
				<span class='text'>Concerned over rumours that Alexander III was about to enter into an alliance with the Byzantine Emperor [[Manuel I Komnenos|Manuel&amp;nbsp;I]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Comyn|1851|p=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; in October 1166 Frederick embarked on his fourth Italian campaign, hoping as well to secure the claim of Paschal&amp;nbsp;III and the coronation of his wife Beatrice as Holy Roman Empress</span>
				<span class='text'>This time, Henry the Lion refused to join Frederick on his Italian trip, tending instead to his own disputes with neighbors and his continuing expansion into Slavic territories in northeastern Germany</span>

				<span class='text'>250&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Comyn|1851|p=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heartened by this victory, Frederick lifted the siege of Ancona and hurried to Rome, where he had his wife crowned empress and also received a second coronation from Paschal&amp;nbsp;III</span>

				<span class='text'>250&quot;/&gt; Unfortunately, his campaign was halted by the sudden outbreak of an epidemic ([[malaria]] or the [[Bubonic plague|plague]]), which threatened to destroy the Imperial army and drove the emperor as a fugitive to Germany,&lt;ref name=&quot;Comyn, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>251&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Comyn|1851|p=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he remained for the ensuing six years</span>

				<span class='text'>Many Swabian counts, including his cousin the young Duke of Swabia, Frederick&amp;nbsp;IV, died in 1167, so he was able to organize a new mighty territory in the Duchy of Swabia under his reign in this time</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  The cities of northern Italy had become exceedingly wealthy through trade, representing a marked turning point in the transition from medieval feudalism</span>
				<span class='text'> While continental feudalism had remained strong socially and economically, it was in deep political decline by the time of Frederick Barbarossa</span>
				<span class='text'>When the northern Italian cities inflicted a defeat on Frederick at [[Alessandria]] in 1175, the European world was shocked</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  With the refusal of Henry the Lion to bring help to Italy, the campaign was a complete failure</span>
				<span class='text'>Frederick suffered a heavy defeat at the [[Battle of Legnano]] near Milan, on 29 May 1176, where he was wounded and for some time was believed to be dead</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Comyn|1851|p=257}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This battle marked the turning point in Frederick's claim to empire</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Davis|1957|pp=332 et seq</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt; He had no choice other than to begin negotiations for peace with Alexander III and the Lombard League</span>
				<span class='text'>In the Peace of Anagni in 1176, Frederick recognized Alexander III as pope, and in the [[Peace of Venice]] in 1177, Frederick and Alexander III were formally reconciled</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Brown|1972|pp=164–165}}&lt;/ref&gt;The scene was similar to that which had occurred between [[Pope Gregory VII]] and [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor]] at [[Canossa]] a century earlier</span>
				<span class='text'>The conflict was the same as that resolved in the [[Concordat of Worms]]: Did the Holy Roman Emperor have the power to name the pope and bishops? The [[Investiture controversy]] from previous centuries had been brought to a tendentious peace with the Concordat of Worms and affirmed in the [[First Council of the Lateran]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Now it had recurred, in a slightly different form</span>
				<span class='text'>Frederick had to humble himself before Alexander III at Venice</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Comyn|1851|p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emperor acknowledged the pope's sovereignty over the Papal States, and in return Alexander acknowledged the emperor's overlordship of the Imperial Church</span>
				<span class='text'>Also in the Peace of Venice, a truce was made with the Lombard cities, which took effect in August 1178</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The grounds for a permanent peace were not established until 1183, however, in the [[Peace of Constance]], when Frederick conceded their right to freely elect town magistrates</span>
				<span class='text'>By this move, Frederick recovered his nominal domination over Italy, which became his chief means of applying pressure on the papacy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Le Goff|2000|pp=96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;In a move to consolidate his reign after the disastrous expedition into Italy, Frederick was formally crowned [[King of Burgundy]] at [[Arles]] on 30 June 1178</span>
				<span class='text'>Although traditionally the German kings had automatically inherited the royal crown of Arles since the time of [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]], Frederick felt the need to be crowned by the Archbishop of Arles, regardless of his laying claim to the title from 1152</span>
				<span class='text'>rederick did not forgive Henry the Lion for refusing to come to his aid in 1174</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Comyn|1851|p=263}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1180, Henry had successfully established a powerful and contiguous state comprising Saxony, Bavaria, and substantial territories in the north and east of Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>Taking advantage of the hostility of other German princes to Henry, Frederick had Henry tried in absentia by a court of bishops and princes in 1180, declared that imperial law overruled traditional German law, and had Henry stripped of his lands and declared an outlaw</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Davis|1957|p=333}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then invaded Saxony with an imperial army to force his cousin to surrender</span>
				<span class='text'>Henry's allies deserted him, and he finally had to submit in November 1181</span>
				<span class='text'>Henry spent three years in exile at the court of his father-in-law [[Henry II of England]] in Normandy before being allowed back into Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>He finished his days in Germany, as the much-diminished Duke of Brunswick</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Comyn|1851|p=264}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Frederick's desire for revenge was sated</span>
				<span class='text'>Henry the Lion lived a relatively quiet life, sponsoring arts and architecture</span>
				<span class='text'>Frederick's victory over Henry did not gain him as much in the German feudalistic system as it would have in the English feudalistic system</span>
				<span class='text'>While in England the pledge of fealty went in a direct line from overlords to those under them, the Germans pledged oaths only to the direct overlord, so that in Henry's case, those below him in the feudal chain owed nothing to Frederick</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, despite the diminished stature of Henry the Lion, Frederick did not gain his allegiances</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Cantor|1969|pp=433–434}}&lt;/ref&gt;Frederick was faced with the reality of disorder among the German states, where continuous civil wars were waged between pretenders and the ambitious who wanted the crown for themselves</span>
				<span class='text'>Italian unity under German rule was more myth than truth</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite proclamations of German hegemony, the pope was the most powerful force in Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Le Goff|2000|pp=102–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Frederick returned to Germany after his defeat in northern Italy, he was a bitter and exhausted man</span>
				<span class='text'>The German princes, far from being subordinated to royal control, were intensifying their hold on wealth and power in Germany and entrenching their positions</span>
				<span class='text'>There began to be a generalized social desire to &quot;create greater Germany&quot; by conquering the Slavs to the east</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Cantor|1969|p=429}}&lt;/ref&gt;Although it appeared that the Italian city states had achieved a measure of independence from Frederick as a result of his failed fifth expedition into Italy,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Comyn|1851|p=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; the emperor had not given up on his Italian dominions</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1184, he held a massive celebration when his two eldest sons were knighted, and thousands of knights were invited from all over Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>While payments upon the knighting of a son were part of the expectations of an overlord in England and France, only a &quot;gift&quot; was given in Germany for such an occasion</span>
				<span class='text'>Frederick's monetary gain from this celebration is said to have been modest</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dahmus|1969|p=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later in 1184, Frederick again moved into Italy, this time joining forces with the local rural nobility to reduce the power of the Tuscan cities</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Comyn|1851|p=265}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1186, he engineered the marriage of his son Henry to [[Constance of Sicily]], heiress to the [[Kingdom of Sicily]], over the objections of [[Pope Urban III]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Comyn|1851|p=266}}&lt;/ref&gt;===Third Crusade and death===Pope Urban III died shortly after, and was succeeded by Gregory VIII, who was more concerned with troubling reports from the Holy Land than with a power struggle with Barbarossa</span>
				<span class='text'>After making his peace with the new pope, Frederick vowed to take up the cross at the [[Diet of Mainz]] in 1188</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Kampers 6252b&quot; /&gt; Frederick embarked on the [[Third Crusade]] (1189–92), a massive expedition in conjunction with the French, led by [[Philip II of France|King Philip Augustus]], and the English, under [[Richard I of England|King Richard the Lionheart]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Frederick organized a grand army of 100,000 men (including 20,000 knights) and set out on the overland route to the Holy Land;&lt;ref name=&quot;Phillips66&quot;&gt;J</span>

				<span class='text'>The king agreed, and a Hungarian army of 2,000 men led by Géza escorted the German emperor's forces</span>
				<span class='text'>The armies coming from western Europe pushed on through [[Anatolia]], where they were victorious in taking [[Aksehir]] and defeating the Turks in the [[Battle of Iconium (1190)|Battle of Iconium]], and entered [[Cilician Armenia]]</span>

				<span class='text'>263&quot;/&gt;On 10 June 1190, Emperor Frederick drowned in the [[Saleph]] river</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Comyn|1851|p=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accounts of the event are conflicting</span>
				<span class='text'>ome historians believe he may have had a heart attack that complicated matters</span>
				<span class='text'>Some of Frederick's men put him in a barrel of vinegar to preserve his body</span>
				<span class='text'>rederick's death plunged his army into chaos and lead to its near total dissolution, saving Muslim forces defending Jerusalem from almost certain defeat</span>
				<span class='text'>nly 5,000 soldiers, a small fraction of the original force, arrived in [[Akko|Acre]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Barbarossa's son, [[Frederick VI, Duke of Swabia|Frederick VI]] of Swabia, carried on with the remnants of the German army, along with the Hungarian army under the command of Prince Géza, with the aim of burying the emperor in [[Jerusalem]], but efforts to conserve his body in vinegar failed</span>
				<span class='text'>Hence, his flesh was interred in the [[Church of St Peter]] in [[Antioch]], his bones in the cathedral of [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], and his heart and inner organs in [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>263&quot;/&gt;The unexpected demise of Frederick left the Crusader army under the command of the rivals Philip II and Richard, who had traveled to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] separately by sea, and ultimately led to its dissolution</span>
				<span class='text'>Richard continued to the East where he defeated Saladin in many battles, winning significant territories along the shores of Palestine, but ultimately failed to win the war by conquering Jerusalem itself before he was forced to return to his own territories in north-western Europe, known as the [[Angevin Empire]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He returned home after he signed the [[Treaty of Ramla]] agreeing that Jerusalem would remain under Muslim control while allowing unarmed Christian pilgrims and traders to visit the city</span>
				<span class='text'>The treaty also reduced the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Latin Kingdom]] to a geopolitical coastal strip extending from Tyre to Jaffa</span>
				<span class='text'>=Frederick and the Justinian code==The increase in wealth of the trading cities of northern Italy led to a revival in the study of the [[Justinian Code]], a Latin legal system that had become extinct centuries earlier</span>
				<span class='text'>Legal scholars renewed its application</span>
				<span class='text'>It is speculated that [[Pope Gregory VII]] personally encouraged the Justinian rule of law and had a copy of it</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Corpus Iuris Civilis]] (Justinian Body of Civil Law) has been described as the greatest code of law ever devised</span>
				<span class='text'>{Who|date=June 2009}} It envisaged the law of the state as a reflection of natural moral law, the principle of rationality in the universe</span>
				<span class='text'>By the time Frederick assumed the throne, this legal system was well established on both sides of the Alps</span>
				<span class='text'>He was the first to utilize the availability of the new professional class of lawyers</span>
				<span class='text'>The Civil Law allowed Frederick to use these lawyers to administer his kingdom in a logical and consistent manner</span>
				<span class='text'>It also provided a framework to legitimize his claim to the right to rule both Germany and northern Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>In the old days of Henry V and Henry VI, the claim of [[divine right of kings]] had been severely undermined by the [[Investiture controversy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Church had won that argument in the common man's mind</span>
				<span class='text'>There was no divine right for the German king to also control the church by naming both bishops and popes</span>
				<span class='text'>The institution of the Justinian code was used, perhaps unscrupulously, by Frederick to lay claim to divine powers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Cantor|1969|pp=340–342}}&lt;/ref&gt;In Germany, Frederick was a political realist, taking what he could and leaving the rest</span>
				<span class='text'>In Italy, he tended to be a romantic reactionary, reveling in the antiquarian spirit of the age, exemplified by a revival of classical studies and Roman law</span>
				<span class='text'>It was through the use of the restored Justinian code that Frederick came to view himself as a new Roman emperor</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Davis|1957|p=332}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roman law gave a rational purpose for the existence of Frederick and his imperial ambitions</span>
				<span class='text'>It was a counterweight to the claims of the Church to have authority because of divine revelation</span>
				<span class='text'>The Church was opposed to Frederick for ideological reasons, not the least of which was the humanist nature found in the revival of the old Roman legal system</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Davis|1957|p=324}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Pepin the Short]] sought to become king of the Franks in the 8th century, the church needed military protection, so Pepin found it convenient to make an ally of the pope</span>
				<span class='text'>Frederick, however, desired to put the pope aside and claim the crown of old Rome simply because he was in the likeness of the greatest emperors of the pre-Christian era</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Pope Adrian IV]] was naturally opposed to this view and undertook a vigorous propaganda campaign designed to diminish Frederick and his ambition</span>
				<span class='text'>To a large extent, this was successful</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Davis|1957|p=325}}&lt;/ref&gt;==Charismatic leader==Historians have compared Frederick to [[Henry II of England]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Both were considered the greatest and most charismatic leaders of their age</span>
				<span class='text'>Each possessed a rare combination of qualities that made him appear superhuman to his contemporaries: longevity, boundless ambition, extraordinary organizing skill, and greatness on the battlefield</span>
				<span class='text'>Both were handsome and proficient in courtly skills, without appearing effeminate or affected</span>
				<span class='text'>Both came to the throne in the prime of manhood</span>
				<span class='text'>Each had an element of learning, without being considered impractical intellectuals but rather more inclined to practicality</span>
				<span class='text'>Each found himself in the possession of new legal institutions that were put to creative use in governing</span>
				<span class='text'>Both Henry and Frederick were viewed to be sufficiently and formally devout to the teachings of the Church, without being moved to the extremes of spirituality seen in the great saints of the 12th century</span>
				<span class='text'>In making final decisions, each relied solely upon his own judgment,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Cantor|1969|pp=422–423}}&lt;/ref&gt; and both were interested in gathering as much power as they could</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Cantor|1969|p=424}}&lt;/ref&gt;In keeping with this view of Frederick, his uncle, [[Otto of Freising]], wrote an account of Frederick's reign entitled ''Gesta Friderici I imperatoris'' (Deeds of the Emperor Frederick)</span>
				<span class='text'>Otto died after finishing the first two books, leaving the last two to [[Rahewin of Freising|Rahewin]], his provost</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Cantor|1969|p=360}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Rahewin's physical description of Frederick reproduces word-for-word (except for details of hair and beard) a description of another monarch written nearly eight hundred years earlier by Sidonius Apollinaris:&lt;ref&gt;[[Sidonius Apollinaris]], ''Epistles'' 1</span>

				<span class='text'>His formidable enemies defeated him on almost every side, yet in the end he emerged triumphant</span>
				<span class='text'>When Frederick came to the throne, the prospects for the revival of German imperial power were extremely thin</span>
				<span class='text'>The great German princes had increased their power and land holdings</span>
				<span class='text'>The king had been left with only the traditional family domains and a vestige of power over the bishops and abbeys</span>
				<span class='text'>The backwash of the Investiture controversy had left the German states in continuous turmoil</span>
				<span class='text'>Rival states were in perpetual war</span>
				<span class='text'>These conditions allowed Frederick to be both warrior and occasional peace-maker, both to his advantage</span>

				<span class='text'>Legend says he is not dead, but asleep with his knights in a cave in the [[Kyffhäuser]] mountain in [[Thuringia]] or Mount [[Untersberg]] in Bavaria, Germany, and that when the ravens cease to fly around the mountain he will awake and restore Germany to its ancient greatness</span>
				<span class='text'>According to the story, his red beard has grown through the table at which he sits</span>
				<span class='text'>His eyes are half closed in sleep, but now and then he raises his hand and sends a boy out to see if the ravens have stopped flying</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Brown|1972|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar story, set in Sicily, was earlier attested about his grandson, [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Hartwig Kantorowicz|Kantorowicz]], ''Frederick II''; last chapter&lt;/ref&gt; To garner political support the [[German Empire]] built atop the Kyffhäuser the [[Kyffhäuser Monument]], which declared [[Kaiser Wilhelm I]] the reincarnation of Frederick; the 1896 dedication occurred on 18 June, the day of Frederick's coronation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Jarausch|1997|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;In medieval Europe, the [[Golden Legend]] became refined by [[Jacopo da Voragine]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This was a popularized  interpretation of the Biblical end of the world</span>
				<span class='text'>It consisted of three things: (1) terrible natural disasters; (2) the arrival of the [[Antichrist]]; (3) the establishment of a good king to combat the anti-Christ</span>
				<span class='text'>These millennial fables were common and freely traded by the populations on Continental Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>[[End-time]] accounts had been around for thousands of years, but entered the Christian tradition with the writings of the Apostle Peter</span>
				<span class='text'>German propaganda played into the exaggerated fables believed by the common people by characterizing Frederick Barbarossa and Frederick II as personification of the &quot;good king&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Le Goff|2000|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;Frederick's uncle, Otto, bishop of Freising wrote a biography entitled ''The Deeds of Frederick Barbarosa'', which is considered to be an accurate history of the king</span>

				<span class='text'>The latter work was full of Augustinian negativity concerning the nature of the world and history</span>
				<span class='text'>His work on Frederick is of opposite tone, being an optimistic portrayal of the glorious potentials of imperial authority</span>
