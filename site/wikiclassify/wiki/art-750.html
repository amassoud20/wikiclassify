				<span class='text'>Williams is often counted as being among a group of four major American poets who were all born in a twelve-year period that began in 1874</span>
				<span class='text'>The group also consists of [[Robert Frost]], who was born in 1874; [[Wallace Stevens]], who was born in 1879; and [[H</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Doolittle]], who was born in 1886</span>
				<span class='text'>Of these four, Williams died last, several weeks after Frost</span>
				<span class='text'>(Stevens was first to die, in 1955, while H</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>lived until 1961)</span>
				<span class='text'>n addition to his writing, Williams had a long career as a [[physician]] practicing both [[pediatrics]] and general medicine</span>
				<span class='text'>He was affiliated with what was then known as Passaic General Hospital in [[Passaic, New Jersey]], where he served as the hospital's chief of pediatrics from 1924 until his death</span>
				<span class='text'>The hospital, which is now known as [[St</span>
				<span class='text'>Mary's Hospital (Passaic, New Jersey)|St</span>
				<span class='text'>Mary's General Hospital]], pays tribute to Williams with a memorial plaque that states &quot;we walk the wards that Williams walked&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>His grandmother, an Englishwoman deserted by her husband, had come to the United States with her son, remarried, and moved to Puerto Rico</span>
				<span class='text'>Her son, Williams's father, married a Puerto Rican woman of [[Northern Basque Country|French Basque]] and [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Dutch Jewish]] descent</span>
				<span class='text'>illiams received his primary and secondary education in Rutherford until 1897, when he was sent for two years to a school near Geneva and to the [[Lycée Condorcet]] in Paris</span>
				<span class='text'>He attended the [[Horace Mann School]] upon his return to New York City and, having passed a special examination, was admitted in 1902 to the [[Perelman School of Medicine|medical school of the University of Pennsylvania]], from which he graduated in 1906</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> Pound, and Wallace Stevens) when he published one of his most experimental books, ''Kora in Hell: Improvisations''</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;A few years later, Williams published one of his seminal books of poetry, ''Spring and All'', which contained the classic poems &quot;By the road to the contagious hospital,&quot; &quot;[[The Red Wheelbarrow]],&quot; and &quot;To Elsie</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; However, in 1922, the year before Williams published ''[[Spring and All]]'', [[T</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Eliot]] published ''[[The Waste Land]]'' which became a literary sensation and overshadowed Williams's very different brand of poetic [[Modernism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In his ''Autobiography'', Williams would later write, &quot;I felt at once that ''The Waste Land'' had set me back twenty years and I'm sure it did</span>
				<span class='text'>Critically, Eliot returned us to the classroom just at the moment when I felt we were on a point to escape to matters much closer to the essence of a new art form itself—rooted in the locality which should give it fruit</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; And although he respected the work of Eliot, Williams became openly critical of Eliot's highly intellectual style with its frequent use of foreign languages and allusions to classical and European literature</span>

				<span class='text'>He also examined the role of the poet in American society and famously summarized his poetic method in the phrase &quot;No ideas but in things&quot; (found in his poem &quot;A Sort of a Song&quot; and repeated again and again in [[Paterson (poem)|''Paterson'']])</span>

				<span class='text'>He reproduces the details of what he sees with surprising freshness, clarity, and economy; and he sees just as extraordinarily, sometimes, the forms of this earth, the spirit moving behind the letters</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, William</span>
				<span class='text'>''The Imagist Poem, Modern Poetry in Miniature'' (Story Line Press, 1963, expanded 2001)</span>
				<span class='text'>ISBN 1-58654-009-2&lt;/ref&gt;A contemporary, [[Harriet Monroe ]] said of Williams 'to assert his freedoms he must play the devil, showing himself rioting in purple and turquoise pools of excess</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;ref&gt;Review of 'Others Again ' ed</span>
				<span class='text'>By [[Alfred Kreymborg]] Poetry: A Magazine of Verse 1915&lt;/ref&gt;Williams's major collections are ''Spring and All'' (1923), ''[[The Desert Music and Other Poems]]'' (1954), ''[[Pictures from Brueghel and Other Poems]]'' (1962), and ''Paterson'' (1963, repr</span>
				<span class='text'>1992)</span>
				<span class='text'>His most anthologized poem is &quot;The Red Wheelbarrow&quot;, an example of the Imagist movement's style and principles (see also &quot;[[This Is Just To Say]]&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Williams, like his peer and friend Ezra Pound, had already rejected the Imagist movement by the time this poem was published as part of ''Spring and All'' in 1923</span>
				<span class='text'>illiams is strongly associated with the American modernist movement in literature and saw his poetic project as a distinctly American one; he sought to renew language through the fresh, raw idiom that grew out of America's cultural and social heterogeneity, at the same time freeing it from what he saw as the worn-out language of British and European culture</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1920, this project took shape in ''Contact'', a periodical launched by Williams and fellow writer [[Robert McAlmon]]: &quot;The two editors sought American cultural renewal in the local condition in clear opposition to the internationalists—Pound, ''The Little Review'', and the Baroness</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gammel, ''Baroness Elsa'', 264-65</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; [[Yvor Winters]], the poet/critic, judged that Williams's verse bears a certain resemblance to the best [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] poets of the 13th century</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Primitivism and Decadence: A Study of American Experimental Poetry''</span>
				<span class='text'>New York: Arrow Editions, 1937</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Williams sought to invent an entirely fresh and uniquely American form of poetry whose subject matter centered on everyday circumstances of life and the lives of common people</span>
				<span class='text'>He came up with the concept of the &quot;variable foot&quot; which Williams never clearly defined, although the concept vaguely referred to Williams's method of determining line breaks</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[The Paris Review]]'' called it &quot;a metrical device to resolve the conflict between form and freedom in verse</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Stanley Koehler, ''Paris Review'', Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>6, 1962</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;One of Williams's aims, in experimenting with his &quot;variable foot&quot;, was to show the American (opposed to European) rhythm that he claimed was present in everyday American language</span>
				<span class='text'>Stylistically, Williams also worked with variations on a line-break pattern that he labeled &quot;[[triadic-line poetry]]&quot; in which he broke a long line into three free-verse segments</span>
				<span class='text'>A well-known example of the &quot;triadic line [break]&quot; can be found in Williams's love-poem &quot;[[Asphodel, That Greeny Flower]]</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of American Poetry: The Twentieth Century'', ISBN 978-1-57958-240-1&lt;/ref&gt;In a review of Herbert Leibowitz's biography of William Carlos Williams, ''&quot;Something Urgent I Have to Say to You&quot;: The Life and Works of William Carlos Williams'', book critic Christopher Benfey wrote of Williams's poetry: &quot;Early and late, Williams held the conviction that poetry was, in his friend Kenneth Burke's phrase, 'equipment for living, a necessary guide amid the bewilderments of life</span>
				<span class='text'> The American ground was wild and new, a place where a blooming foreigner needed all the help he could get</span>
				<span class='text'>Poems were as essential to a full life as physical health or the love of men and women</span>
