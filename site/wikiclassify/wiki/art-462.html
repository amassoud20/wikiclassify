				<span class='text'>His father was his main Torah teacher until his death when Rashi was still a youth</span>
				<span class='text'>At the age of 17 he married and soon after went to learn in the [[yeshiva]] of Rabbi [[Yaakov ben Yakar]] in Worms, returning to his wife three times yearly, for the [[Days of Awe]], [[Passover]] and [[Shavuot]]</span>
				<span class='text'>When Rabbi Yaakov died in 1064, Rashi continued learning in Worms for another year in the yeshiva of his relative, Rabbi [[Isaac ben Eliezer Halevi]], who was also chief rabbi of Worms</span>
				<span class='text'>Then he moved to [[Mainz]], where he studied under another of his relatives, Rabbi Isaac ben Judah, the rabbinic head of Mainz and one of the leading sages of the [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]] region straddling France and Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>ashi's teachers were students of [[Rabbeinu Gershom]] and Rabbi [[Eliezer Hagadol]], leading Talmudists of the previous generation</span>
				<span class='text'>From his teachers, Rashi imbibed the oral traditions pertaining to the Talmud as they had been passed down for centuries, as well as an understanding of the Talmud's unique logic and form of argument</span>

				<span class='text'>Since its publication, Rashi's commentary on the Torah is standard in almost all Chumashim produced within the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] community</span>
				<span class='text'>abbi [[Mordechai Leifer]] of [[Nadvorna (Hasidic dynasty)|Nadvorna]] said that anyone who learns the weekly [[Parsha]] together with the commentary by Rashi every week, is guaranteed to sit in the [[Yeshiva]] (school) of Rashi in the Afterlife</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|250px|thumb|right|An early printing of the Talmud ([[Ta'anit]] 9b); Rashi's commentary is at the bottom of the right column, continuing for a few lines into the left column</span>
				<span class='text'>]Rashi wrote the first comprehensive [[Talmud#Commentaries|commentary on the Talmud]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Rashi's commentary, drawing on his knowledge of the entire contents of the Talmud, attempts to provide a full explanation of the words and of the logical structure of each Talmudic passage</span>
				<span class='text'>Unlike other commentators, Rashi does not paraphrase or exclude any part of the text, but elucidates phrase by phrase</span>
				<span class='text'>Often he provides punctuation in the unpunctuated text, explaining, for example, &quot;This is a question&quot;; &quot;He says this in surprise,&quot; &quot;He repeats this in agreement,&quot; etc</span>
				<span class='text'>s in his commentary on the Tanakh, Rashi frequently illustrates the meaning of the text using analogies to the professions, crafts, and sports of his day</span>
				<span class='text'>He also translates difficult Hebrew or [[Aramaic]] words into the spoken [[French language]] of his day, giving latter-day scholars a window into the vocabulary and pronunciation of [[Old French]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ashi exerted a decisive influence on establishing the correct text of the Talmud</span>
				<span class='text'>Up to and including his age, texts of each Talmudic tractate were copied by hand and circulated in yeshivas</span>
				<span class='text'>Errors often crept in: sometimes a copyist would switch words around, and other times incorporate a student's marginal notes into the main text</span>
				<span class='text'>Because of the large number of merchant-scholars who came from throughout the Jewish world to attend the great fairs in Troyes, Rashi was able to compare different manuscripts and readings in [[Tosefta]], [[Jerusalem Talmud]], [[Midrash]], [[Targum]], and the writings of the [[Geonim]], and determine which readings should be preferred</span>
				<span class='text'>However, in his humility, he deferred to scholars who disagreed with him</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, in [[Kodashim|Chulin]] 4a, he comments about a phrase, &quot;We do not read this</span>
				<span class='text'>But as for those who do, this is the explanation</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot;Rashi's commentary, which covers nearly all of the Babylonian Talmud (a total of 30 tractates), has been included in every version of the Talmud since its first printing in the fifteenth century</span>
				<span class='text'>It is always situated towards the middle of the opened book display; i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> on the side of the page closest to the binding</span>
				<span class='text'>ome of the other printed commentaries which are attributed to Rashi were composed by others, primarily his students</span>
				<span class='text'>In some commentaries, the text indicates that Rashi died before completing the tractate, and that it was completed by a student</span>
				<span class='text'>This is true of the tractate Makkot, the concluding portions of which were composed by his son-in-law, Rabbi Judah ben Nathan, and of the tractate [[Bava Batra]], finished (in a more detailed style) by his grandson, the Rashbam</span>
				<span class='text'>There is a legend that the commentary on Nedarim, which is clearly not his, was actually composed by his daughters</span>
				<span class='text'>Another legend states that Rashi died while writing a commentary on Talmud, and that the very last word he wrote was 'tahor,' which means pure in Hebrew - indicating that his soul was pure as it left his body</span>
				<span class='text'>==Responsa===About 300 of Rashi's [[responsa]] and halakhic decisions are extant</span>
				<span class='text'>These responsa were copied and preserved by his students</span>
				<span class='text'>''Siddur Rashi'', compiled by an unknown student, also contains Rashi's responsa on prayer</span>
				<span class='text'>Other compilations include ''Sefer Hapardes'', edited by Rabbi Shemayah, Rashi's student, and ''Sefer Haorah'', prepared by Rabbi Nathan Hamachiri</span>
				<span class='text'>==Influence in non-Jewish circles===Rashi also influenced non-Jewish circles</span>
				<span class='text'>His commentaries on the Bible circulated in many different communities especially his commentaries on the Pentateuch</span>
				<span class='text'>In the 12th–17th centuries, Rashi's influence spread from French and German provinces to Spain and the east</span>
				<span class='text'>He had a tremendous influence on Christian scholars</span>
				<span class='text'>The French monk [[Nicholas de Lyra|Nicolas de Lyre]] of Manjacoria, who was known as the &quot;ape of Rashi&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Skolnik, Fred 2007&quot;&gt;Skolnik, Fred, and Michael Berenbaum</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=solomon/&gt;Rashi's influence grew the most in the 15th century; from the 17th century onwards, his commentaries were translated into many other languages</span>

				<span class='text'>Although Rashi had an influence on communities outside of Judaism, his lack of connection to science prevented him from entering the general domain and he remained more popular among the Jewish community</span>

				<span class='text'>After the 12th century, criticism on Rashi's commentaries became common on Jewish works such as the Talmud</span>
				<span class='text'>The criticisms mainly dealt with difficult passages</span>
				<span class='text'>Generally Rashi provides the ''pshat'' or literal meaning of Jewish texts, while his disciples known as the Tosafot, criticized his work and gave more interpretative descriptions of the texts</span>
				<span class='text'>The Tosafot's commentaries can be found in Jewish texts opposite Rashi's commentary</span>
				<span class='text'>The Tosafot added comments and criticism in places where Rashi had not added comments</span>
				<span class='text'>The Tosafot went beyond the passage itself in search of arguments, parallels, and distinctions that could be drawn out</span>
				<span class='text'>This addition to Jewish texts was seen as causing a &quot;major cultural product&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloomberg, Jon 2004&quot;&gt;Bloomberg, Jon</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Additionally Rashi was according to different scholars a corporealist, this could indeed be argued when one reads Rashi´s commentaries on a sentence in the old testament: &quot;And Pharaoh shall not listen to you, and I shall give My hand upon Egypt, and I shall take out my host, my people, the Children of Israel, from the land of Egypt, with great judgments&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>(Exodus 7:4)Rashi comments (on the Pentateuch): &quot;My hand&quot;—An actual hand (yad mamash), with which to smite them</span>
				<span class='text'>This is brought as one of several evidential cases to which one can conclude that Rashi was a corporealist</span>

				<span class='text'>The fact that the text does not say &quot;Yado Mamash - His actual hand&quot; is indicative that this reading is more likely</span>
