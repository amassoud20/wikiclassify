				<span class='text'> Proclus believes that Euclid is not much younger than these, and that he must have lived during the time of [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy I]] because he was mentioned by [[Archimedes]] (287–212&amp;nbsp;BC)</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Struik p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;51 (&quot;their logical structure has influenced scientific thinking perhaps more than any other text in the world&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;There is no mention of Euclid in the earliest remaining copies of the ''Elements'', and most of the copies say they are &quot;from the edition of [[Theon of Alexandria|Theon]]&quot; or the &quot;lectures of Theon&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Heath (1981), p</span>
				<span class='text'>360</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; while the text considered to be primary, held by the Vatican, mentions no author</span>
				<span class='text'>The only reference that historians rely on of Euclid having written the ''Elements'' was from Proclus, who briefly in his ''Commentary on the Elements'' ascribes Euclid as its author</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough best known for its geometric results, the ''Elements'' also includes [[number theory]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It considers the connection between [[perfect numbers]] and [[Mersenne primes]] (known as the [[Euclid–Euler theorem]]), the [[Euclid's theorem|infinitude of prime numbers]], [[Euclid's lemma]] on factorization (which leads to the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]] on uniqueness of [[integer factorization|prime factorizations]]), and the [[Euclidean algorithm]] for finding the [[greatest common divisor]] of two numbers</span>
				<span class='text'>he geometrical system described in the ''Elements'' was long known simply as ''[[geometry]]'', and was considered to be the only geometry possible</span>
				<span class='text'>Today, however, that system is often referred to as ''[[Euclidean geometry]]'' to distinguish it from other so-called ''[[Non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean geometries]]'' that mathematicians discovered in the 19th century</span>

				<span class='text'>]In addition to the ''Elements'', at least five works of Euclid have survived to the present day</span>
				<span class='text'>They follow the same logical structure as ''Elements'', with definitions and proved propositions</span>
				<span class='text'> ''[[Data (Euclid)|Data]]'' deals with the nature and implications of &quot;given&quot; information in geometrical problems; the subject matter is closely related to the first four books of the ''Elements''</span>
				<span class='text'> ''On Divisions of Figures'', which survives only partially in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] translation, concerns the division of geometrical figures into two or more equal parts or into parts in given [[ratio]]s</span>

				<span class='text'> ''[[Catoptrics]]'', which concerns the mathematical theory of mirrors, particularly the images formed in plane and spherical concave mirrors</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|200 px|Statue in honor of Euclid in the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]]]]* ''[[Euclid's Optics|Optics]]'' is the earliest surviving Greek treatise on perspective</span>
				<span class='text'>In its definitions Euclid follows the Platonic tradition that vision is caused by [[Emission theory (vision)|discrete rays which emanate from the eye]]</span>
				<span class='text'>One important definition is the fourth: &quot;Things seen under a greater angle appear greater, and those under a lesser angle less, while those under equal angles appear equal</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; In the 36 propositions that follow, Euclid relates the apparent size of an object to its distance from the eye and investigates the apparent shapes of cylinders and cones when viewed from different angles</span>
				<span class='text'>Proposition 45 is interesting, proving that for any two unequal magnitudes, there is a point from which the two appear equal</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Pappus of Alexandria|Pappus]] believed these results to be important in astronomy and included Euclid's ''Optics'', along with his ''Phaenomena'', in the ''Little Astronomy'', a compendium of smaller works to be studied before the ''Syntaxis'' (''Almagest'') of [[Claudius Ptolemy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ther works are credibly attributed to Euclid, but have been lost</span>
				<span class='text'> ''Conics'' was a work on [[conic section]]s that was later extended by [[Apollonius of Perga]] into his famous work on the subject</span>
				<span class='text'>It is likely that the first four books of Apollonius's work come directly from Euclid</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Pappus, &quot;Apollonius, having completed Euclid's four books of conics and added four others, handed down eight volumes of conics</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The Conics of Apollonius quickly supplanted the former work, and by the time of Pappus, Euclid's work was already lost</span>
				<span class='text'> ''[[Porism]]s'' might have been an outgrowth of Euclid's work with conic sections, but the exact meaning of the title is controversial</span>
				<span class='text'> ''Pseudaria'', or ''Book of Fallacies'', was an elementary text about errors in [[reasoning]]</span>
				<span class='text'> ''Surface Loci'' concerned either [[Locus (mathematics)|loci]] (sets of points) on surfaces or loci which were themselves surfaces; under the latter interpretation, it has been hypothesized that the work might have dealt with [[Quadric|quadric surfaces]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Several works on [[mechanics]] are attributed to Euclid by Arabic sources</span>
				<span class='text'>''On the Heavy and the Light'' contains, in nine definitions and five propositions, Aristotelian notions of moving bodies and the concept of specific gravity</span>
				<span class='text'>''On the Balance'' treats the theory of the lever in a similarly Euclidean manner, containing one definition, two axioms, and four propositions</span>
				<span class='text'>A third fragment, on the circles described by the ends of a moving lever, contains four propositions</span>
				<span class='text'>These three works complement each other in such a way that it has been suggested that they are remnants of a single treatise on mechanics written by Euclid</span>
