				<span class='text'>He also released four albums of original material on Berkeley-based [[Fantasy Records]], with rants, comic routines, and satirical interviews on the themes that made him famous: [[jazz]], [[moral philosophy]], [[politics]], [[patriotism]], [[religion]], [[law]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[abortion]], [[psychoactive drug|drugs]], the [[Ku Klux Klan]], and [[Jewishness]]</span>
				<span class='text'>These albums were later compiled and re-released as ''The Lenny Bruce Originals</span>

				<span class='text'>It was recorded and later released as a three-disc set, titled ''The Carnegie Hall Concert</span>

				<span class='text'>His ideal was to walk out there like [[Charlie Parker]], take that mike in his hand like a horn and blow, blow, blow everything that came into his head just as it came into his head with nothing censored, nothing translated, nothing mediated, until he was pure mind, pure head sending out brainwaves like radio waves into the heads of every man and woman seated in that vast hall</span>
				<span class='text'>Sending, sending, sending, he would finally reach a point of [[clairvoyance]] where he was no longer a performer but rather a medium transmitting messages that just came to him from out there — from recall, fantasy, prophecy</span>
				<span class='text'> point at which, like the practitioners of [[automatic writing]], his tongue would outrun his mind and he would be saying things he didn't plan to say, things that surprised, delighted him, cracked him up — as if he were a spectator at his own performance!}}==Personal life==Bruce met his future wife, [[Honey Harlow]], a [[stripper]] from [[Baltimore, Maryland]], in 1951</span>

				<span class='text'>As the master of ceremonies, his job was to introduce the strippers while performing his own ever-evolving material</span>
				<span class='text'>The clubs of the Valley provided the perfect environment for Bruce to create new routines: according to Bruce's primary biographer, [[Albert Goldman]], it was &quot;precisely at the moment when he sank to the bottom of the barrel and started working the places that were the lowest of the low&quot; that he suddenly broke free of &quot;all the restraints and inhibitions and disabilities that formerly had kept him just mediocre and began to blow with a spontaneous freedom and resourcefulness that resembled the style and inspiration of his new friends and admirers, the jazz musicians of the modernist school</span>
