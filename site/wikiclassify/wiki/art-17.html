				<span class='text'>He argued that the fact of existence can not be inferred from or accounted for by the essence of existing things and that form and matter by themselves cannot interact and originate the movement of the universe or the progressive actualization of existing things</span>

				<span class='text'>While he was imprisoned in the castle of Fardajan near Hamadhan Avicenna wrote his famous    literally falling man    to demonstrate human  and the substantiality and immateriality of the soul</span>
				<span class='text'>Avicenna believed his Floating Man thought experiment demonstrated that the soul is a substance and claimed humans cannot doubt their own consciousness even in a situation that prevents all sensory data input</span>
				<span class='text'>The thought experiment told its readers to imagine themselves created all at once while suspended in the air isolated from all  which includes no sensory contact with even their own bodies</span>
				<span class='text'>He argued that in this scenario one would still have </span>
				<span class='text'>Because it is conceivable that a person suspended in air while cut off from  would still be capable of determining his own existence the thought experiment points to the conclusions that the soul is a perfection independent of the body and an immaterial substance</span>

				<span class='text'>Following is an English translation of the argumentHowever Avicenna posited the brain as the place where reason interacts with sensation</span>

				<span class='text'>The first knowledge of the flying person would be I am affirming his or her essence</span>
				<span class='text'> That essence could not be the body obviously as the flying person has no sensation</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus the knowledge that I am is the core of a human being  the soul exists and is self aware</span>

				<span class='text'>mpnbsp67–89</span>
				<span class='text'>Avicennas psychology requires that connection between the body and soul be strong enough to ensure the souls individuation but weak enough to allow for its immortality</span>
				<span class='text'>Avicenna grounds his psychology on physiology which means his account of the soul is one that deals almost entirely with the natural science of the body and its abilities of perception</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus the philosophers connection between the soul and body is explained almost entirely by his understanding of perception in this way bodily perception interrelates with the immaterial human intellect</span>
				<span class='text'>In sense perception the perceiver senses the form of the object first by perceiving features of the object by our external senses</span>
				<span class='text'>This sensory information is supplied to the internal senses which merge all the pieces into a whole unified conscious experience</span>
				<span class='text'>This process of perception and abstraction is the nexus of the soul and body for the material body may only perceive material objects while the immaterial soul may only receive the immaterial universal forms</span>
				<span class='text'>The way the soul and body interact in the final abstraction of the universal from the concrete particular is the key to their relationship and interaction which takes place in the physical body</span>
				<span class='text'>The soul completes the action of intellection by accepting forms that have been abstracted from matter</span>
				<span class='text'>This process requires a concrete particular material to be abstracted into the universal intelligible immaterial</span>
				<span class='text'>The material and immaterial interact through the Active Intellect which is a divine light containing the intelligible forms</span>
				<span class='text'>  The Active Intellect reveals the universals concealed in material objects much like the sun makes color available to our eyes</span>
