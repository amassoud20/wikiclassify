				<span class='text'>Her paper, giving a brief and simple account of her work, was presented for her to the ''Académie'' on 12 April 1898 by her former professor, [[Gabriel Lippmann]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;robert7&quot;/&gt; Even so, just as Thompson had been beaten by Becquerel, so Curie was beaten in the race to tell of her discovery that thorium gives off rays in the same way as uranium; two months earlier, [[Gerhard Carl Schmidt]] had published his own finding in Berlin</span>

				<span class='text'>Radium's radioactivity was so great that it could not be ignored</span>
				<span class='text'>It seemed to contradict the principle of the conservation of energy and therefore forced a reconsideration of the foundations of physics</span>
				<span class='text'>On the experimental level the discovery of radium provided men like Ernest Rutherford with sources of radioactivity with which they could probe the structure of the atom</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result of Rutherford's experiments with alpha radiation, the nuclear atom was first postulated</span>
				<span class='text'>In medicine, the radioactivity of radium appeared to offer a means by which cancer could be successfully attacked</span>

				<span class='text'>To attain her scientific achievements, she had to overcome barriers that were placed in her way because she was a woman, in both her native and her adoptive country</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;gwiazdapolarna&quot;/&gt; In an unusual decision, Curie intentionally refrained from patenting the radium-isolation process, so that the scientific community could do research unhindered</span>
