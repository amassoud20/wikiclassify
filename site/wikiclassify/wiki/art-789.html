				<span class='text'>The events of the new decathlon differed slightly from the American version</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;track and field athletes</span>
				<span class='text'>It was not Thorpe's first try at baseball, as the public would soon learn</span>
				<span class='text'>== All-Around Champion ===After his victories at the Olympic Games in Sweden, on September 2, 1912, he returned to Celtic Park, the home of the [[Irish American Athletic Club]], in [[Queens]], New York (where he had qualified four months earlier for the Olympic Games), to compete in the [[Amateur Athletic Union]]'s All-Around Championship</span>
				<span class='text'>Competing against [[Bruno Brodd]] of the [[Irish American Athletic Club]] and J</span>
				<span class='text'>Bredemus of [[Princeton University]], he won seven of the ten events contested and came in second in the remaining three</span>
				<span class='text'>With a total point score of 7,476&amp;nbsp;points, Thorpe broke the previous record of 7,385&amp;nbsp;points set in 1909, (also set at Celtic Park), by [[Martin Sheridan]], the champion athlete of the Irish American Athletic Club</span>

				<span class='text'>I never expect to look upon a finer athlete</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;  He told a reporter from ''[[New York World]]'', &quot;Thorpe is the greatest athlete that ever lived</span>

				<span class='text'>Even when I was in my prime, I could not do what he did today</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, 118</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;=== Controversy ===In 1912, strict rules regarding amateurism were in effect for athletes participating in the Olympics</span>
				<span class='text'>Athletes who received money prizes for competitions, were sports teachers or had competed previously against professionals were not considered amateurs and were barred from competition</span>
				<span class='text'>n late January 1913, the ''[[Worcester Telegram]]'' published a story announcing that Thorpe had played professional baseball, and other U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;newspapers followed up the story</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Flatter&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'&quot;Jim&quot; Thorpe Admits He Is Professional, and Retires from Athletics', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', January 28, 1913, p</span>
				<span class='text'>8</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Charges that Thorpe had played professional baseball in Winston Salem, N</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>were first published in a Worcester (Mass</span>
				<span class='text'> newspaper last week</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Thorpe had indeed played professional baseball in the [[Eastern Carolina League]] for [[Rocky Mount, North Carolina|Rocky Mount]], North Carolina, in 1909 and 1910, receiving meager pay; reportedly as little as US$2 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|2|1910|r=0}}}} today) per game and as much as US$35 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|35|1910|r=0}}}} today) per week</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson&quot;/&gt; College players, in fact, regularly spent summers playing professionally but most used aliases, unlike Thorpe</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot;/&gt;Although the public didn't seem to care much about Thorpe's past,&lt;ref name=&quot;Schaff&quot;&gt;Schaffer and Smith</span>
				<span class='text'>p</span>
				<span class='text'>50</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] (AAU), and especially its secretary [[James Edward Sullivan]], took the case very seriously</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Schaffer and Smith</span>
				<span class='text'>p</span>
				<span class='text'>40</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Thorpe wrote a letter to Sullivan, in which he admitted playing professional baseball:&lt;ref name=&quot;Flatter&quot;/&gt;{{quote|I hope I will be partly excused by the fact that I was simply an Indian schoolboy and did not know all about such things</span>
				<span class='text'>In fact, I did not know that I was doing wrong, because I was doing what I knew several other college men had done, except that they did not use their own names&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>}His letter didn't help</span>
				<span class='text'>The AAU decided to withdraw Thorpe's amateur status retroactively and asked the [[International Olympic Commission]] (IOC) to do the same</span>
				<span class='text'>Later that year, the IOC unanimously decided to [[List of stripped Olympic medals|strip]] Thorpe of his Olympic titles, medals and awards and declare him a professional</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough Thorpe had played for money, the AAU and IOC did not follow the rules for disqualification</span>
				<span class='text'>The rulebook for the 1912&amp;nbsp;Olympics stated that protests had to be made &quot;within&quot; 30&amp;nbsp;days from the closing ceremonies of the games</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;usoc&quot;/&gt; The first newspaper reports did not appear until January&amp;nbsp;1913, about six months after the Stockholm Games had concluded</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;usoc&quot;/&gt; There is also some evidence that Thorpe's amateur status had been questioned long before the Olympics, but the AAU had ignored the issue until being confronted with it in 1913</span>
				<span class='text'>he only positive element of this affair for Thorpe was that, as soon as the news was reported that he had been declared a professional, he received offers from professional sports clubs</span>

				<span class='text'>60&lt;/ref&gt;== Professional career ===== Baseball free agent ===Because the minor league team that last held Jim Thorpe's contract had disbanded in 1910, he found himself in the rare position of being a sought after [[free agent]] at the major league level during the era of the [[reserve clause]], and thus had a choice of baseball teams for which to play</span>
