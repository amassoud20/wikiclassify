				<span class='text'>=Education, apprenticeship and poetry==Davy was born in [[Penzance]] in [[Cornwall]] on 17 December 1778</span>

				<span class='text'>quot; Davy said: &quot;I consider it fortunate I was left much to myself as a child, and put upon no particular plan of study</span>

				<span class='text'>Davy's [[indenture]] is dated 10 February 1795</span>
				<span class='text'>In the [[apothecary]]'s dispensary, Davy became a chemist, and a garret in Tonkin's house was where he conducted his earliest chemical experiments</span>
				<span class='text'>Davy's friends said: &quot;This boy Humphry is incorrigible</span>
				<span class='text'>He will blow us all</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; His eldest sister complained of the ravages made on her dresses by corrosive substances</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=DNB /&gt;[[John Ayrton Paris]] remarked that poetry written by the young Davy &quot;bear the stamp of lofty genius&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Davy's first preserved poem entitled ''The Sons of Genius'' is dated 1795 and marked by the usual immaturity of youth</span>
				<span class='text'>Other poems written in the following years, especially ''On the Mount's Bay'' and ''St Michael's Mount'', are descriptive verses, showing sensibility but no true poetic imagination</span>
				<span class='text'>Three of Davy's paintings from around 1796 have been donated to the [[Penlee House]] museum at Penzance</span>
				<span class='text'>One is of the view from above [[Gulval]] showing the church, [[Mount's Bay]] and [[St Michael's Mount|the Mount]], while the other two depict [[Loch Lomond]] in Scotland</span>

				<span class='text'>Dunkin remarked: â€˜I tell thee what, Humphry, thou art the most quibbling hand at a dispute I ever met with in my life</span>
				<span class='text'>€™ One winter day he took Davy to the Larigan River,&lt;ref&gt;The Larigan, or Laregan, river is a stream in Penzance</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; to show him that rubbing two plates of ice together developed sufficient energy by motion, to melt them, and that after the motion was suspended, the pieces were united by regelation</span>
				<span class='text'>It was a crude form of analogous experiment exhibited by Davy in the lecture-room of the [[Royal Institution]] that elicited considerable attention</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=DNB /&gt; As professor at the [[Royal Institution]], Davy repeated many of the ingenious experiments he learned from his friend and mentor, Robert Dunkin</span>
				<span class='text'>=Early scientific interests==[[Davies Gilbert|Davies Giddy]] met Davy in Penzance carelessly swinging on the half-gate of Dr Borlase's house, and interested by his talk invited him to his house at Tredrea and offered him the use of his library</span>
				<span class='text'>This led to an introduction to Dr Edwards, who lived at Hayle Copper House</span>
				<span class='text'>Edwards was a lecturer in chemistry in the school of [[St</span>
				<span class='text'>Bartholomew's Hospital]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He permitted Davy to use his laboratory and possibly directed his attention to the floodgates of the port of [[Hayle]], which were rapidly decaying as a result of the contact between copper and iron under the influence of [[seawater]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Galvanic corrosion]] was not understood at that time, but the phenomenon prepared Davy's mind for subsequent experiments on ship's [[copper sheathing]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Gregory Watt, son of [[James Watt (inventor)|James Watt]], visited Penzance for his health's sake, and while lodging at the Davy's house became a friend and gave him instructions in chemistry</span>
				<span class='text'>Davy was acquainted with the [[Wedgwood]] family, who spent a winter at Penzance</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=DNB /&gt;[[Thomas Beddoes]] and [[John Hailstone]] were engaged in a geological controversy on the rival merits of the [[Plutonism|Plutonian]] and [[Neptunist]] hypotheses</span>
				<span class='text'>They travelled together to examine the Cornish coast accompanied by Davies Gilbert and made Davy's acquaintance</span>
				<span class='text'>Beddoes, who had established at [[Bristol]] a 'Pneumatic Institution,' needed an assistant to superintend the laboratory</span>
				<span class='text'>Gilbert recommended Davy, and in 1798 Gregory Watt showed Beddoes the ''Young man's Researches on Heat and Light'', which were subsequently published by him in the first volume of ''West-Country Contributions''</span>
				<span class='text'>After prolonged negotiations, mainly by Gilbert, Mrs Davy and Borlase consented to Davy's departure, but Tonkin wished him to remain in his native town as a surgeon, and altered his will when he found that Davy insisted on going to Dr Beddoes</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1802, Humphry Davy had what was then, the most powerful electrical battery in the world at the Royal Institution</span>
				<span class='text'>With it, Davy created the first [[incandescent light]] by passing a current through a thin strip of platinum, chosen because the metal had an extremely high melting point</span>
				<span class='text'>It was neither sufficiently bright nor long lasting enough to be of practical use, but demonstrated the principle</span>
				<span class='text'>By 1806 he was able to demonstrate a much more powerful form of electric lighting to the [[Royal Society]] in London</span>
				<span class='text'>It was an early form of [[Arc lamp|arc light]] which produced its illumination from an electric arc created between two charcoal rods</span>
				<span class='text'>=Pneumatic Institution==[[File:Watt James von Breda</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|[[James Watt]] in 1792 by [[Carl Frederik von Breda]]]]On 2 October 1798, Davy joined the [[Pneumatic Institution]] at Bristol</span>
				<span class='text'>It had been established to investigate the medical powers of factitious airs and gases, and Davy was to superintend the various experiments</span>
				<span class='text'>The arrangement agreed between Dr Beddoes and Davy was liberal and enabled Davy to give up all claims on his paternal property in favour of his mother</span>
				<span class='text'>He did not intend to abandon the medical profession and was determined to study and graduate at Edinburgh but he soon began to fill parts of the institution with voltaic batteries</span>
				<span class='text'>While living in Bristol, Davy met the [[Earl of Durham]], who was a resident in the institution for his health and became close friends with Gregory Watt, [[James Watt]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] and [[Robert Southey]], all of whom became regular users of [[nitrous oxide]] (laughing gas), to which Davy became addicted</span>
				<span class='text'>The gas was first synthesized in 1772 by the [[natural philosopher]] and chemist [[Joseph Priestley]], who called it ''phlogisticated nitrous air'' (see [[phlogiston]])</span>

				<span class='text'>The gas was popular among Davy's friends and acquaintances, and he noted that it might be useful for performing surgical operations</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;In his 1800 ''Researches, Chemical and Philosophical'' (p</span>
				<span class='text'>56), Davy commented: &quot;''As nitrous oxide in its extensitve operation appears capable of destroying pain, it may probably be used with advantage during surgical operations in which no great effusion of blood takes place</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;DNB&quot; /&gt;In the gas experiments Davy ran considerable risks</span>
				<span class='text'>His respiration of [[nitric oxide]] which may have combined with air in the mouth to form [[nitric acid]] (HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;),&lt;ref name=&quot;Jay2014&quot; /&gt; severely injured the mucous membrane, and in Davy's attempt to inhale four quarts of 'pure hydrocarbonate' gas in an experiment with [[carbon monoxide]] he 'seemed sinking into annihilation</span>
				<span class='text'> On being removed into the open air, Davy faintly articulated, 'I do not think I shall die,'&lt;ref name=&quot;Jay2014&quot; /&gt; but some hours elapsed before the painful symptoms ceased</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;DNB&quot; /&gt; Davy was able to take his own pulse as he staggered out of the laboratory and into the garden, and he described it in his notes as 'threadlike and beating with excessive quickness'</span>
				<span class='text'>n this year the first volume of the ''West-Country Collections'' was issued</span>
				<span class='text'>Half consisted of Davy's essays ''On Heat, Light, and the Combinations of Light'', ''On Phos-oxygen and its Combinations'', and on the ''Theory of Respiration''</span>
				<span class='text'>On 22 February 1799 Davy, wrote to Davies Gilbert, â€˜I am now as much convinced of the non-existence of [[Caloric theory|caloric]] as I am of the existence of light</span>
				<span class='text'> In another letter to Gilbert, on 10 April, Davy informs him: &quot;I made a discovery yesterday which proves how necessary it is to repeat experiments</span>
				<span class='text'>The gaseous oxide of azote (the laughing gas) is perfectly respirable when pure</span>
				<span class='text'>It is never deleterious but when it contains nitrous gas</span>
				<span class='text'>I have found a mode of making it pure</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He said that he breathed sixteen quarts of it for nearly seven minutes, and that it â€˜absolutely intoxicated me</span>
				<span class='text'>€™ During this year Davy published his ''Researches, Chemical and Philosophical, chiefly concerning Nitrous Oxide and its Respiration''</span>
				<span class='text'>In after years Davy regretted he had ever published these immature hypotheses, which he subsequently designated â€˜the dreams of misemployed genius which the light of experiment and observation has never conducted to truth</span>
				<span class='text'>€™&lt;ref name=DNB /&gt;Davy's later time at the institution was spent partially in experimentation</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1800, Davy informed Gilbert that he had been â€˜repeating the galvanic experiments with successâ€™ in the intervals of the experiments on the gases, which â€˜almost incessantly occupied him from January to April</span>
				<span class='text'>€™==Royal Institution==In 1799, [[Count Rumford]] had proposed the establishment in London of an 'Institution for Diffusing Knowledge', i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>the [[Royal Institution]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The house in [[Albemarle Street]] was bought in April 1799</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn |Holmes |2008 |pp=285}} Rumford became secretary to the institution, and Dr [[Thomas Garnett (physician)|Thomas Garnett]] was the first lecturer</span>

				<span class='text'>]In February 1801 Davy was interviewed by the committee of the Royal Institution, comprising [[Joseph Banks]], [[Benjamin Thompson]] (who had been appointed Count Rumford) and [[Henry Cavendish]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Davy wrote to Davies Gilbert on 8 March 1801 about the offers made by Banks and Thompson, a possible move to London and the promise of funding for his work in galvanism</span>
				<span class='text'>He also mentioned that he might not be collaborating further with Beddoes on therapeutic gases</span>
				<span class='text'>The next day Davy left Bristol to take up his new post at the Royal Institution,&lt;ref name=&quot;AOW&quot;/&gt; it having been resolved 'that Humphry Davy be engaged in the service of the Royal Institution in the capacity of assistant lecturer in chemistry, director of the chemical laboratory, and assistant editor of the journals of the institution, and that he be allowed to occupy a room in the house, and be furnished with coals and candles, and that he be paid a salary of 100l</span>
				<span class='text'>per annum</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;ref name=&quot;DNB&quot; /&gt;On 25 April 1801, Davy gave his first lecture on the relatively new subject of 'Galvanism'</span>
				<span class='text'>He and his friend Coleridge had had many conversations about the nature of human knowledge and progress, and Davy's lectures gave his audience a vision of human civilisation brought forward by scientific discovery</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;It [science] has bestowed on him powers which may almost be called creative; which have enabled him to modify and change the beings surrounding him, and by his experiments to interrogate nature with power, not simply as a scholar, passive and seeking only to understand her operations, but rather as a master, active with his own instruments</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AOW&quot;/&gt; The first lecture garnered rave reviews, and by the June lecture Davy wrote to John King that his last lecture had attendance of nearly 500 people</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;There was Respiration, Nitrous Oxide, and unbounded Applause</span>
				<span class='text'>Amen!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AOW&quot;/&gt;Davy's lectures also included spectacular and sometimes dangerous chemical demonstrations for his audience, a generous helping of references to divine creation, and genuine scientific information</span>
				<span class='text'>Not only a popular lecturer, the young and handsome Davy acquired a huge female following around London, and nearly half of the attendees pictured in Gillray's cartoon are female</span>
				<span class='text'>When Davy's lecture series on Galvanism ended, he progressed to a new series on Agricultural Chemistry, and his popularity continued to skyrocket</span>
				<span class='text'>By June 1802, after just over a year at the Institution and at the age of&amp;nbsp;23, Davy was nominated to full lecturer at the [[Royal Institution]] of Great Britain</span>
				<span class='text'>Garnett quietly resigned, citing health reasons</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;AOW&quot;/&gt;In November 1804 Davy became a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]], over which he would later preside</span>
				<span class='text'>He was one of the founding members of the [[Geological Society]] in 1807&lt;ref&gt;[http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>]{{main|Davy lamp}}After his return to England in 1815, Davy experimented with lamps for use in coal mines</span>
				<span class='text'>There had been many mining explosions caused by [[firedamp]] or [[methane]] often ignited by open flames of the lamps then used by miners</span>
				<span class='text'>In particular the [[Felling mine disaster]] in 1812 near [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] caused great loss of life, and action was needed to improve underground lighting and especially the lamps used by miners</span>
				<span class='text'>Davy conceived of using an iron gauze to enclose a lamp's flame, and so prevent the methane burning inside the lamp from passing out to the general atmosphere</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the idea of the [[safety lamp]] had already been demonstrated by [[William Reid Clanny]] and by the then unknown (but later very famous) engineer [[George Stephenson]], Davy's use of wire gauze to prevent the spread of flame was used by many other inventors in their later designs</span>
				<span class='text'>George Stephenson's lamp was very popular in the north-east coalfields, and used the same principle of preventing the flame reaching the general atmosphere, but by different means</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn |Holmes |2008 |pp=364â€“373}} Unfortunately, although the new design of gauze lamp initially did seem to offer protection, it gave much less light, and quickly deteriorated in the wet conditions of most pits</span>
				<span class='text'>Rusting of the gauze quickly made the lamp unsafe, and the number of deaths from firedamp explosions rose yet further</span>
				<span class='text'>here was some discussion as to whether Davy had discovered the principles behind his lamp without the help of the work of [[Smithson Tennant]], but it was generally agreed that the work of both men had been independent</span>
				<span class='text'>Davy refused to patent the lamp, and its invention led to his being awarded the [[Rumford medal]] in 1816</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;) and [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]] had already been [[knight]]ed, this was, at the time, the first such honour ever conferred on a man of science in Britain</span>
				<span class='text'>A year later he became President of the [[Royal Society]]</span>
				<span class='text'>avy's laboratory assistant, [[Michael Faraday]], went on to enhance Davy's work and would become the more famous and influential scientist</span>
				<span class='text'>Davy is supposed to have even claimed Faraday as his greatest discovery</span>
				<span class='text'>Davy later accused Faraday of [[plagiarism]], however, causing Faraday (the first [[Fullerian Professor of Chemistry]]) to cease all research in [[classical electromagnetism|electromagnetism]] until his mentor's death</span>
				<span class='text'>f a sanguine, somewhat irritable temperament, Davy displayed characteristic enthusiasm and energy in all his pursuits</span>
				<span class='text'>As is shown by his verses and sometimes by his prose, his mind was highly imaginative; the poet Coleridge declared that if he &quot;had not been the first chemist, he would have been the first poet of his age&quot;, and Southey said that &quot;he had all the elements of a poet; he only wanted the art</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; In spite of his ungainly exterior and peculiar manner, his happy gifts of exposition and illustration won him extraordinary popularity as a lecturer, his experiments were ingenious and rapidly performed, and Coleridge went to hear him &quot;to increase his stock of metaphors</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The dominating ambition of his life was to achieve fame, but though that sometimes betrayed him into petty jealousy, it did not leave him insensible to the claims on his knowledge of the &quot;cause of humanity&quot;, to use a phrase often employed by him in connection with his invention of the miners' lamp</span>
				<span class='text'>Of the smaller observances of etiquette he was careless, and his frankness of disposition sometimes exposed him to annoyances which he might have avoided by the exercise of ordinary tact</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Davy, Sir Humphry|volume=7|pages=871-873}}&lt;/ref&gt;According to one of Davy's biographers, [[June Z</span>
