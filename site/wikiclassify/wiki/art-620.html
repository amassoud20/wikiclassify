				<span class='text'>Robert Oppenheimer has been a source of confusion</span>
				<span class='text'>Historians Alice Kimball Smith and Charles Weiner sum up the general historical opinion in their volume ''Robert Oppenheimer: Letters and recollections'', on page 1: &quot;Whether the 'J' in Robert's name stood for Julius or, as Robert himself once said, 'for nothing' may never be fully resolved</span>
				<span class='text'>His brother Frank surmised that the 'J' was symbolic, a gesture in the direction of naming the eldest son after the father but at the same time a signal that his parents did not want Robert to be a 'junior</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot; It is not [[Ashkenazi Jews|Askenazic Jewish]] custom to name children after living relatives</span>
				<span class='text'>In [[Peter Goodchild]]'s ''J</span>
				<span class='text'>Robert Oppenheimer: Shatterer of Worlds'', it is said that Robert's father, Julius, added the empty initial to give Robert's name additional distinction, but Goodchild's book has no footnotes, so the source of this assertion is unclear</span>
				<span class='text'>Robert's claim that the 'J' stood &quot;for nothing&quot; is taken from an interview conducted by [[Thomas S</span>
				<span class='text'>Kuhn]] on November 18, 1963, which currently resides in the Archive for the History of Quantum Physics</span>

				<span class='text'>As the wartime head of the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]], Oppenheimer is among those who are called the &quot;father of the atomic bomb&quot; for their role in the [[Manhattan Project]], the [[World War II]] project that developed the first [[nuclear weapon]]s that ended the war with the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The first atomic bomb was detonated on July 16, 1945, in the [[Trinity test]] in [[New Mexico]]; Oppenheimer remarked later that it brought to mind words from the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'': &quot;Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds</span>

				<span class='text'>After provoking the ire of many politicians with his outspoken opinions during the [[Second Red Scare]], he had his [[security clearance#United States|security clearance]] revoked in a much-publicized hearing in 1954, and was effectively stripped of his direct political influence; he continued to lecture, write and work in physics</span>

				<span class='text'>With his students he also made important contributions to the modern theory of [[neutron star]]s and [[black hole]]s, as well as to [[quantum mechanics]], [[quantum field theory]], and the interactions of [[cosmic ray]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>As a teacher and promoter of science, he is remembered as a founding father of the American school of theoretical physics that gained world prominence in the 1930s</span>
				<span class='text'>After World War II, he became director of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in Princeton</span>

				<span class='text'>Julius came to America with no money, no baccalaureate studies, and no knowledge of the English language</span>
				<span class='text'>He got a job in a textile company and within a decade was an executive with the company</span>
				<span class='text'>Ella was from Baltimore</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bird|Sherwin|2005|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912 the family moved to an apartment on the eleventh floor of 155 [[Riverside Drive (Manhattan)|Riverside Drive]], near West 88th Street, [[Manhattan]], an area known for luxurious mansions and town houses</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Cassidy, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>5-11&quot;/&gt; Their art collection included works by [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Édouard Vuillard]], and at least three original paintings by [[Vincent van Gogh]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bird|Sherwin|2005|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert had a younger brother, [[Frank Oppenheimer|Frank]], who also became a physicist</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cassidy|2005|pp=16, 145}}&lt;/ref&gt;Oppenheimer was initially schooled at Alcuin Preparatory School, and in 1911 entered the [[Ethical Culture Fieldston School|Ethical Culture Society School]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Cassidy 2005 35&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Cassidy|2005|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; This had been founded by [[Felix Adler (Society for Ethical Culture)|Felix Adler]] to promote a form of ethical training based on the [[Ethical Culture]] movement, whose motto was &quot;Deed before Creed&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>His father had been a member of the Society for many years, serving on its board of trustees from 1907 to 1915</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cassidy|2005|pp=23, 29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oppenheimer was a versatile scholar, interested in English and French literature, and particularly in [[mineralogy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cassidy|2005|pp=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He completed the third and fourth grades in one year, and skipped half the eighth grade</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Cassidy 2005 35&quot; /&gt; During his final year, he became interested in chemistry</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cassidy|2005|pp=43–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; He entered [[Harvard College]] a year late, at age 18, because he suffered an attack of [[ulcerative colitis|colitis]] while [[prospecting]] in [[Joachimstal]] during a family summer vacation in Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>To help him recover from the illness, his father enlisted the help of his English teacher Herbert Smith who took him to New Mexico, where Oppenheimer fell in love with horseback riding and the southwestern United States</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cassidy|2005|pp=61–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;In addition to majoring in chemistry, he was also required by Harvard's rules to study history, literature, and philosophy or mathematics</span>
				<span class='text'>He made up for his late start by taking six courses each term and was admitted to the undergraduate [[honor society]] [[Phi Beta Kappa]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In his first year he was admitted to graduate standing in physics on the basis of independent study, which meant he was not required to take the basic classes and could enroll instead in advanced ones</span>
				<span class='text'>A course on [[thermodynamics]] taught by [[Percy Williams Bridgman|Percy Bridgman]] attracted him to experimental physics</span>
				<span class='text'>He graduated [[summa cum laude]] in three years</span>

				<span class='text'>He wrote to [[Ernest Rutherford]] requesting permission to work at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Bridgman provided Oppenheimer with a recommendation, which conceded that Oppenheimer's clumsiness in the laboratory made it apparent his forte was not experimental but rather theoretical physics</span>
				<span class='text'>Rutherford was unimpressed, but Oppenheimer went to Cambridge in the hope of landing another offer</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cassidy|2005|pp=90–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was ultimately accepted by [[J</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cassidy|2005|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; He developed an antagonistic relationship with his tutor, [[Patrick Blackett, Baron Blackett|Patrick Blackett]], who was only a few years his senior</span>
				<span class='text'>While on vacation, as recalled by his friend [[Francis Fergusson]], Oppenheimer once confessed that he had left an apple doused with noxious chemicals on Blackett's desk</span>
				<span class='text'>While Ferguson's account is the only detailed version of this event, Oppenheimer's parents were alerted by the university authorities who considered placing him on probation, a fate prevented by his parents successfully lobbying the authorities</span>

				<span class='text'>Fergusson noticed that Oppenheimer was not well and to help distract him from his depression told Oppenheimer that he (Fergusson) was to marry his girlfriend Frances Keeley</span>
				<span class='text'>Oppenheimer did not take the news well</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|Weiner|1980|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;In 1926 he left Cambridge for the [[University of Göttingen]] to study under [[Max Born]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Göttingen was one of the world's leading centers for theoretical physics</span>
				<span class='text'>Oppenheimer made friends who went on to great success, including [[Werner Heisenberg]], [[Pascual Jordan]], [[Wolfgang Pauli]], [[Paul Dirac]], [[Enrico Fermi]] and [[Edward Teller]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was known for being too enthusiastic in discussion, sometimes to the point of taking over seminar sessions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cassidy|2005|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; This irritated some of Born's other students so much that [[Maria Goeppert]] presented Born with a petition signed by herself and others threatening a boycott of the class unless he made Oppenheimer quiet down</span>
				<span class='text'>Born left it out on his desk where Oppenheimer could read it, and it was effective without a word being said</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bird|Sherwin|2005|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;He obtained his Doctor of Philosophy degree in March 1927 at age 23, supervised by Born</span>

				<span class='text'>He and Born published a famous paper on the [[Born–Oppenheimer approximation]], which separates nuclear motion from electronic motion in the mathematical treatment of molecules, allowing nuclear motion to be neglected to simplify calculations</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cassidy|2005|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;== Early professional work ===== Educational work ===Oppenheimer was awarded a [[United States National Research Council]] fellowship to the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech) in September 1927</span>
				<span class='text'>Bridgman also wanted him at Harvard, so a compromise was reached whereby he split his fellowship for the 1927–28 academic year between Harvard in 1927 and Caltech in 1928</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cassidy|2005|pp=115–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Caltech he struck up a close friendship with [[Linus Pauling]], and they planned to mount a joint attack on the nature of the [[chemical bond]], a field in which Pauling was a pioneer, with Oppenheimer supplying the mathematics and Pauling interpreting the results</span>
				<span class='text'>Both the collaboration and their friendship were nipped in the bud when Pauling began to suspect Oppenheimer of becoming too close to his wife, [[Ava Helen Pauling]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Once, when Pauling was at work, Oppenheimer had arrived at their home and invited Ava Helen to join him on a tryst in Mexico</span>
				<span class='text'> Though she refused and reported the incident to her husband,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cassidy|2005|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; the invitation, and her apparent nonchalance about it, disquieted Pauling and he ended his relationship with Oppenheimer</span>
				<span class='text'>Oppenheimer later invited him to become head of the Chemistry Division of the [[Manhattan Project]], but Pauling refused, saying he was a pacifist</span>

				<span class='text'>There he was given the nickname of ''Opje'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bird|Sherwin|2005|pp=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; later anglicized by his students as &quot;Oppie&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bird|Sherwin|2005|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; From Leiden he continued on to the [[ETH]] in Zurich to work with [[Wolfgang Pauli]] on [[quantum mechanics]] and the [[continuous spectrum]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=72–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, Groves was appointed director of what became known as the Manhattan Project</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groves selected Oppenheimer to head the project's secret weapons laboratory, a choice which surprised many, as Oppenheimer was not known to be politically aligned with the conservative military, nor to be an efficient leader of large projects</span>
				<span class='text'>The fact that he did not have a Nobel Prize, and might not have the prestige to direct fellow scientists, did concern Groves</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Groves|1962|pp=61–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was impressed by Oppenheimer's singular grasp of the practical aspects of designing and constructing an atomic bomb, and by the breadth of his knowledge</span>
				<span class='text'>As a [[military engineer]], Groves knew that this would be vital in an interdisciplinary project that would involve not just physics, but chemistry, [[metallurgy]], [[explosive weapon|ordnance]] and [[engineering]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Groves also detected in Oppenheimer something that many others did not, an &quot;overweening ambition&quot; that Groves reckoned would supply the drive necessary to push the project to a successful conclusion</span>
				<span class='text'>Isidor Rabi considered the appointment &quot;a real stroke of genius on the part of General Groves, who was not generally considered to be a genius&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bird|Sherwin|2005|pp=185–187}}&lt;/ref&gt;Oppenheimer and Groves decided that for security and cohesion they needed a centralized, secret research laboratory in a remote location</span>
				<span class='text'>Scouting for a site in late 1942, Oppenheimer was drawn to New Mexico, not far from his ranch</span>
				<span class='text'>On November 16, 1942, Oppenheimer, Groves and others toured a prospective site</span>
				<span class='text'> Oppenheimer feared that the high cliffs surrounding the site would make his people feel [[claustrophobic]], while the engineers were concerned with the possibility of flooding</span>
				<span class='text'>He then suggested and championed a site that he knew well: a flat [[mesa]] near [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], which was the site of a private boys' school called the [[Los Alamos Ranch School]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The engineers were concerned about the poor access road and the water supply, but otherwise felt that it was ideal</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Groves|1962|pp=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos Laboratory]] was built on the site of the school, taking over some of its buildings, while many others were erected in great haste</span>
				<span class='text'>There Oppenheimer assembled a group of the top physicists of the time, which he referred to as the &quot;luminaries&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|Weiner|1980|p=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;Initially Los Alamos was supposed to be a military laboratory, and Oppenheimer and other researchers were to be commissioned into the Army</span>

				<span class='text'>[[Bernard Baruch]] was appointed to translate this report into a proposal to the United Nations, resulting in the [[Baruch Plan]] of 1946</span>
				<span class='text'>The Baruch Plan introduced many additional provisions regarding enforcement, in particular requiring inspection of the Soviet Union's uranium resources</span>
				<span class='text'>The Baruch Plan was seen as an attempt to maintain the United States' nuclear monopoly and was rejected by the Soviets</span>
				<span class='text'>With this, it became clear to Oppenheimer that an arms race was unavoidable, due to the mutual suspicion of the United States and the Soviet Union,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bird|Sherwin|2005|pp=347–349}}&lt;/ref&gt; which even Oppenheimer was starting to distrust</span>

				<span class='text'>]After the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) came into being in 1947 as a civilian agency in control of nuclear research and weapons issues, Oppenheimer was appointed as the Chairman of its General Advisory Committee (GAC)</span>
				<span class='text'>From this position he advised on a number of nuclear-related issues, including project funding, laboratory construction and even international policy—though the GAC's advice was not always heeded</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cassidy|2005|pp=264–267}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Chairman of the GAC, Oppenheimer lobbied vigorously for international arms control and funding for basic science, and attempted to influence policy away from a heated arms race</span>
				<span class='text'>When the government questioned whether to pursue a crash program to develop an atomic weapon based on [[nuclear fusion]]—the [[hydrogen bomb]]—Oppenheimer initially recommended against it, though he had been in favor of developing such a weapon during the Manhattan Project</span>
				<span class='text'>He was motivated partly by ethical concerns, feeling that such a weapon could only be used strategically against civilian targets, resulting in millions of deaths</span>
				<span class='text'>He was also motivated by practical concerns, however, as at the time there was no workable design for a hydrogen bomb</span>
				<span class='text'>Oppenheimer felt that resources would be better spent creating a large force of fission weapons</span>
				<span class='text'>He and others were especially concerned about nuclear reactors being diverted from plutonium to [[tritium]] production</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=380–385}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were overridden by Truman, who announced a crash program after the Soviet Union tested their first atomic bomb in 1949</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=406–409}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oppenheimer and other GAC opponents of the project, especially [[James Bryant Conant|James Conant]], felt personally shunned and considered retiring from the committee</span>
				<span class='text'>They stayed on, though their views on the hydrogen bomb were well known</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bird|Sherwin|2005|p=429}}&lt;/ref&gt;In 1951, however, [[Edward Teller]] and mathematician [[Stanislaw Ulam]] developed what became known as the [[Teller-Ulam design]] for a hydrogen bomb</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=535–537}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new design seemed technically feasible and Oppenheimer changed his opinion about developing the weapon</span>
				<span class='text'>As he later recalled:{{quote|The program we had in 1949 was a tortured thing that you could well argue did not make a great deal of technical sense</span>
				<span class='text'>It was therefore possible to argue that you did not want it even if you could have it</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stern|1969|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI furnished Oppenheimer's political enemies with incriminating evidence about his Communist ties</span>
				<span class='text'>These enemies included Strauss, an AEC commissioner who had long harbored resentment against Oppenheimer both for his activity in opposing the hydrogen bomb and for his humiliation of Strauss before Congress some years earlier; regarding Strauss's opposition to the export of radioactive isotopes to other nations, Oppenheimer had memorably categorized these as &quot;less important than electronic devices but more important than, let us say, vitamins</span>

				<span class='text'>Edward Teller, who had been so uninterested in work on the atomic bomb at Los Alamos during the war that Oppenheimer had given him time instead to work on his own project of the hydrogen bomb, had eventually left Los Alamos in 1951 to help found, in 1952, a second laboratory at what would become the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]]</span>
				<span class='text'>There, he could be free of Los Alamos control to develop the hydrogen bomb</span>
				<span class='text'>Long-range thermonuclear &quot;strategic&quot; weapons delivered by jet bombers would necessarily be under control of the new [[United States Air Force]] (USAF)</span>
				<span class='text'>Oppenheimer had for some years pushed for smaller &quot;tactical&quot; nuclear weapons which would be more useful in a limited theater against enemy troops and which would be under control of the Army</span>
				<span class='text'>The two services fought for control of nuclear weapons, often allied with different political parties</span>

				<span class='text'>Unknown to Oppenheimer, both versions were recorded during his interrogations of a decade before</span>
				<span class='text'>He was surprised on the witness stand with transcripts of these, which he had not been given a chance to review</span>
				<span class='text'>In fact, Oppenheimer had never told Chevalier that he had finally named him, and the testimony had cost Chevalier his job</span>
				<span class='text'>Both Chevalier and Eltenton confirmed mentioning that they had a way to get information to the Soviets, Eltenton admitting he said this to Chevalier and Chevalier admitting he mentioned it to Oppenheimer, but both put the matter in terms of gossip and denied any thought or suggestion of treason or thoughts of espionage, either in planning or in deed</span>

				<span class='text'>He has also been seen as symbolizing the dilemmas involving the moral responsibility of the scientist in the nuclear world</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Thorpe&quot; /&gt; The hearings were motivated both by politics, as Oppenheimer was seen as a representative of the previous administration, and by personal considerations stemming from his enmity with Lewis Strauss</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cassidy|2005|pp=305–308}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ostensible reason for the hearing and the issue that aligned Oppenheimer with the liberal intellectuals, Oppenheimer's opposition to hydrogen bomb development, was based as much on technical grounds as on moral ones</span>
				<span class='text'>Once the [[History of the Teller–Ulam design|technical considerations were resolved]], he supported Teller's hydrogen bomb because he believed that the Soviet Union would inevitably construct one too</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cassidy|2005|pp=293–298}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than consistently oppose the &quot;Red-baiting&quot; of the late 1940s and early 1950s, Oppenheimer testified against some of his former colleagues and students, both before and during his hearing</span>
				<span class='text'>In one incident, his damning testimony against former student Bernard Peters was selectively leaked to the press</span>
				<span class='text'>Historians have interpreted this as an attempt by Oppenheimer to please his colleagues in the government and perhaps to divert attention from his own previous left-wing ties and those of his brother</span>
				<span class='text'>In the end it became a liability when it became clear that if Oppenheimer had really doubted Peters' loyalty, his recommending him for the Manhattan Project was reckless, or at least contradictory</span>
