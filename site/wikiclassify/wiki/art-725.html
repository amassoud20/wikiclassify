				<span class='text'>His mother [[Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange|Mary, Princess Royal]], was the daughter of King [[Charles I of England]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1677, he married his mother's niece and his first cousin, [[Mary II of England|Mary]], the daughter of his maternal uncle [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]]</span>
				<span class='text'> [[Protestant]], William participated in several wars against the powerful [[Catholic]] king of France, [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], in coalition with Protestant and Catholic powers in Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>Many Protestants heralded him as a champion of their faith</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1685, his Catholic father-in-law, James, became king of England, Ireland and Scotland</span>
				<span class='text'>James's reign was unpopular with the Protestant majority in Britain</span>
				<span class='text'> William, supported by a group of influential British political and religious leaders, invaded England in what became known as the &quot;[[Glorious Revolution]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>On 5 November 1688, he landed at the southern English port of [[Brixham]]</span>
				<span class='text'>James was deposed and [[William and Mary]] became joint sovereigns in his place</span>
				<span class='text'>They reigned together until her death on 28 December 1694 after which William ruled as sole monarch</span>
				<span class='text'>illiam's reputation as a strong Protestant enabled him to take the British crowns when many were fearful of a revival of Catholicism under James</span>
				<span class='text'>William's final victory at the [[Battle of the Boyne]] in 1690 is still [[The Twelfth|commemorated]] by the [[Orange Order]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His reign in Britain marked the beginning of the transition from the personal rule of the [[House of Stuart|Stuarts]] to the more Parliament-centred rule of the [[House of Hanover]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Claydon, 9&lt;/ref&gt; He was the only child of [[stadtholder]] [[William II of Orange|William II, Prince of Orange]], and [[Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange|Mary, Princess Royal]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Mary was the eldest daughter of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I of England, Scotland and Ireland]], and sister of [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] and [[James II of England|King James II]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ight days before William was born, his father died of [[smallpox]]; thus William was the Sovereign [[Principality of Orange|Prince of Orange]] from the moment of his birth</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Claydon, 14&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately, a conflict ensued between his mother the [[Princess Royal]] and William II's mother, [[Amalia of Solms-Braunfels]], over the name to be given to the infant</span>
				<span class='text'>Mary wanted to name him Charles after her brother, but her mother-in-law insisted on giving him the name William or ''Willem'' to bolster his prospects of becoming stadtholder</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Troost, 26; van der Zee, 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; William II had appointed his wife as his son's guardian in his will; however the document remained unsigned at William II's death and was void</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Troost, 26&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 August 1651, the ''[[Hoge Raad van Holland en Zeeland]]'' (Supreme Court) ruled that guardianship would be shared between his mother, his paternal grandmother and [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William]], the [[Elector of Brandenburg]], whose wife, [[Louise Henriette of Nassau|Louise Henriette]], was his father's eldest sister</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Troost, 26–27</span>
				<span class='text'>The Prussian prince was chosen because he could act as a neutral party mediating between the two women, but also because as a possible heir he was interested in protecting the Orange family fortune, which Amalia feared Mary would squander</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Childhood and education===William's mother showed little personal interest in her son, sometimes being absent for years, and had always deliberately kept herself apart from Dutch society</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 5–6; Troost, 27&lt;/ref&gt; William's education was first laid in the hands of several Dutch governesses, some of English descent, including Walburg Howard&lt;ref name=t3437/&gt; and the Scottish noblewoman, Lady [[Anna Mackenzie]]</span>

				<span class='text'>om/view/article/4467, accessed 29 Nov 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; From April 1656, the prince received daily instruction in the [[Reformed churches|Reformed religion]] from the [[Calvinist]] preacher Cornelis Trigland, a follower of the [[Franciscus Gomarus|Contra-Remonstrant]] theologian [[Gisbertus Voetius]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=t3437&gt;Troost, 34–37&lt;/ref&gt; The ideal education for William was described in ''Discours sur la nourriture de S</span>
				<span class='text'>H</span>
				<span class='text'>Monseigneur le Prince d'Orange'', a short treatise, perhaps by one of William's tutors, [[Constantijn Huygens]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Troost, 27</span>
				<span class='text'>The author may also have been [[Johan van den Kerckhoven]]</span>
				<span class='text'>''Ibid</span>
				<span class='text'>'&lt;/ref&gt; In these lessons, the prince was taught that he was [[Predestination (Calvinism)|predestined]] to become an instrument of [[Divine Providence]], fulfilling the historical destiny of the [[House of Orange-Nassau|House of Orange]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Troost, 36–37&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Jan davids de heem-fleurs avec portrait guillaume III d'Orange</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|The young prince portrayed in a flower garland painting by [[Jan Davidsz de Heem]] filled with symbols of the [[House of Orange-Nassau|House of Orange]]]]From early 1659, William spent seven years at the [[University of Leiden]] for a formal education, under the guidance of ethics professor Hendrik Bornius (though never officially enrolling as a student)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Troost, 37–40&lt;/ref&gt; While residing in the ''Prinsenhof'' at [[Delft]], William had a small personal retinue including [[William Bentinck, 1st Earl of Portland|Hans Willem Bentinck]], and a new governor, [[Frederick Nassau de Zuylenstein]], who (as an illegitimate son of stadtholder [[Frederick Henry of Orange]]) was his paternal uncle</span>
				<span class='text'>He was taught French by [[Samuel Chappuzeau]] (who was dismissed by William's grandmother after the death of his mother)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Meinel&lt;/ref&gt;[[Grand Pensionary]] [[Johan de Witt]] and his uncle [[Cornelis de Graeff]] pushed the [[States of Holland]] to take charge of William's education</span>
				<span class='text'>This was to ensure that he would acquire the skills to serve in a future—though undetermined—state function; the States acted on 25 September 1660</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=troost43&gt;Troost, 43&lt;/ref&gt; This first involvement of the authorities did not last long</span>
				<span class='text'>On 23 December 1660, when William was 10 years old, his mother died of [[smallpox]] at [[Whitehall Palace]], London while visiting her brother [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=troost43/&gt; In her will, Mary requested that Charles look after William's interests, and Charles now demanded the States of Holland end their interference</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Troost, 43–44&lt;/ref&gt; To appease Charles, they complied on 30 September 1661</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Troost, 44&lt;/ref&gt; In 1661, Zuylenstein began to work for Charles</span>
				<span class='text'>He induced William to write letters to Charles asking him to help William become stadtholder someday</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=troost49&gt;Troost, 49&lt;/ref&gt; After his mother's death, William's education and guardianship became a point of contention between [[Orangism (Netherlands)|his dynasty's supporters]] and the advocates of a more republican Netherlands</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 12–17&lt;/ref&gt;The Dutch authorities did their best at first to ignore these intrigues, but in the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] one of Charles's peace conditions was the improvement of the position of his nephew</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=troost49/&gt; As a countermeasure in 1666, when William was 16, the States of Holland officially made him a ward of the government, or a &quot;Child of State&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=troost49/&gt; All pro-English courtiers, including Zuylenstein, were removed from William's company</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=troost49/&gt; William begged De Witt to allow Zuylenstein to stay, but he refused</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=vdk14&gt;Van der Kiste, 14–15&lt;/ref&gt; De Witt, the leading politician of the Republic, took William's education into his own hands, instructing him weekly in state matters—and joining him in a regular game of [[real tennis]]</span>

				<span class='text'>]===Exclusion from stadtholdership==={{Main|First Stadtholderless Period}}After William's father's death, most provinces had left the office of stadtholder vacant</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;In the province of [[Friesland]] that office was filled by William's uncle-by-marriage [[William Frederick, Prince of Nassau-Dietz]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The [[Treaty of Westminster (1654)|Treaty of Westminster]], which ended the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]], had a secret annexe attached on demand of [[Oliver Cromwell]]: this required the [[Act of Seclusion]], which forbade the province of Holland from appointing a member of the House of Orange as stadtholder</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Troost, 29–30&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[English Restoration]], the Act of Seclusion, which had not remained a secret for very long, was declared void as the [[English Commonwealth]] (with which the treaty had been concluded) no longer existed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=troost41&gt;Troost, 41&lt;/ref&gt; In 1660, Mary and Amalia tried to persuade several provincial States to designate William as their future stadtholder, but they all initially refused</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=troost41/&gt;In 1667, as William III approached the age of 18, the [[Orangism (Netherlands)|Orangist party]] again attempted to bring him to power by securing for him the offices of stadtholder and [[Captain-General]]</span>
				<span class='text'>To prevent the restoration of the influence of the House of Orange, De Witt, the leader of the [[Dutch States Party|States Party]], allowed the [[pensionary]] of [[Haarlem]], [[Gaspar Fagel]], to induce the States of Holland to issue the [[Perpetual Edict (1667)|Perpetual Edict]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=troost52&gt;Troost, 52–53&lt;/ref&gt; The Edict declared that the Captain-General or Admiral-General of the Netherlands could not serve as stadtholder in any province</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=troost52/&gt; Even so, William's supporters sought ways to enhance his prestige and, on 19 September 1668, the [[States of Zeeland]] received him as ''First Noble''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=vdk16&gt;Van der Kiste, 16–17&lt;/ref&gt; To receive this honour, William had to escape the attention of his state tutors and travel secretly to [[Middelburg]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=vdk16/&gt; A month later, Amalia allowed William to manage his own household and declared him to be of majority age</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Troost, 57&lt;/ref&gt;The province of Holland, the center of anti-Orangism, abolished the office of stadtholder and four other provinces followed suit in March 1670, establishing the so-called &quot;Harmony&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=troost52/&gt; De Witt demanded an oath from each Holland [[regenten|regent]] (city council member) to uphold the Edict; all but one complied</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=troost52/&gt; William saw all this as a defeat, but in fact this arrangement was a compromise: De Witt would have preferred to ignore the prince completely, but now his eventual rise to the office of supreme army commander was implicit</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Troost, 53–54&lt;/ref&gt; De Witt further conceded that William would be admitted as a member of the ''[[Council of State of the Netherlands|Raad van State]]'', the Council of State, then the [[Generality (Netherlands)|generality]] organ administering the defence budget</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=troost59&gt;Troost, 59&lt;/ref&gt; William was introduced to the council on 31 May 1670 with full voting powers, despite De Witt's attempts to limit his role to that of an advisor</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Troost, 60&lt;/ref&gt;===Conflict with republicans===In November 1670, William obtained permission to travel to England to urge Charles to pay back at least a part of the 2,797,859&amp;nbsp;[[Dutch gulden|guilder]] debt the House of Stuart owed the House of Orange</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=troost62&gt;Troost, 62–64&lt;/ref&gt; Charles was unable to pay, but William agreed to reduce the amount owed to 1,800,000 guilders</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=troost62/&gt; Charles found his nephew to be a dedicated [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] and patriotic Dutchman, and reconsidered his desire to show him the [[Secret treaty of Dover]] with France, directed at destroying the Dutch Republic and installing William as &quot;sovereign&quot; of a Dutch [[rump state]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=troost62/&gt; In addition to differing political outlooks, William found that Charles's and James's lifestyles differed from his own, being more concerned with drinking, gambling, and cavorting with mistresses</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 18–20&lt;/ref&gt;The following year, the Republic's security deteriorated quickly as an Anglo-French attack became imminent</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Troost, 64&lt;/ref&gt; In view of the threat, the States of [[Gelderland]] wanted William to be appointed Captain-General of the [[Dutch States Army]] as soon as possible, despite his youth and inexperience</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Troost, 65&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 December 1671, the States of [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]] made this their official policy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Troost, 66&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 January 1672, the States of [[Holland]] made a counterproposal: to appoint William for just a single campaign</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=troost67&gt;Troost, 67&lt;/ref&gt; The prince refused this and on 25 February a compromise was reached: an appointment by the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] for one summer, followed by a permanent appointment on his 22nd birthday</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=troost67/&gt;Meanwhile, William had written a secret letter to Charles in January 1672 asking his uncle to exploit the situation by exerting pressure on the States to appoint William stadtholder</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=troost65&gt;Troost, 65–66&lt;/ref&gt; In return, William would ally the Republic with England and serve Charles's interests as much as his &quot;honour and the loyalty due to this state&quot; allowed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=troost65/&gt; Charles took no action on the proposal, and continued his war plans with his French ally</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|William III in 1672]]For the Dutch Republic, 1672 proved calamitous, becoming known as the [[rampjaar|&quot;disaster year&quot;]] (Dutch: ''rampjaar'') because of the [[Franco-Dutch War]] and the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]] in which the Netherlands were invaded by France under [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], England, [[Münster]], and [[Cologne]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the Anglo-French fleet was disabled by the [[Battle of Solebay]], in June the French army quickly overran the provinces of Gelderland and Utrecht</span>
				<span class='text'>On 14 June, William withdrew with the remnants of his field army into Holland, where the States had ordered the flooding of [[the Dutch Water Line]] on 8 June</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Troost, 74&lt;/ref&gt; Louis XIV, believing the war was over, began negotiations to extract as large a sum of money from the Dutch as possible</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=troost78&gt;Troost, 78–83&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of a large French army in the heart of the Republic caused a general panic, and the people turned against de Witt and his allies</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=troost78/&gt;On 4 July, the States of Holland appointed William stadtholder, and he took the oath five days later</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=troost76&gt;Troost, 76&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, a special envoy from Charles, [[Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington|Lord Arlington]], met with William in [[Nieuwerbrug]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He offered to make William Sovereign Prince of Holland in exchange for his capitulation—whereas a stadtholder was a mere civil servant</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=troost80&gt;Troost, 80–81&lt;/ref&gt; When William refused, Arlington threatened that William would witness the end of the republic's existence</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=troost80/&gt; William made his famous answer: &quot;There is one way to avoid this: to die defending it in the last ditch&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>On 7 July, the inundations were complete and the further advance of the French army was effectively blocked</span>
				<span class='text'>On 16 July, Zeeland offered the stadtholderate to William</span>

				<span class='text'> Mary was eleven years his junior and he anticipated resistance to a Stuart match from the Amsterdam merchants who had disliked his mother (another Mary Stuart), but William believed that marrying Mary would increase his chances of succeeding to Charles's kingdoms, and would draw England's monarch away from his pro-French policies</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 38–39&lt;/ref&gt; James was not inclined to consent, but Charles II pressured his brother to agree</span>

				<span class='text'>France's annexations in the Southern Netherlands and Germany (the ''[[Chambers of Reunion|Réunion]]'' policy) and the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] in 1685, caused a surge of [[Huguenot]] refugees to the Republic</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Troost, 150–151&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, William secretly induced the States General to send the ''Insinuation'' to Charles, beseeching the king to prevent any Catholics from succeeding him, without explicitly naming James</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|alt=Engraving depicting a king, queen, throne, and arms|upright|A 1703 engraving of King William III and Queen Mary II]]Although the [[Whig (British political faction)|Whigs]] were William's strongest supporters, he initially favoured a policy of balance between the Whigs and Tories</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Troost, 220–223&lt;/ref&gt; The [[George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax|Marquess of Halifax]], a man known for his ability to chart a moderate political course, gained William's confidence early in his reign</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Troost, 221&lt;/ref&gt; The Whigs, a majority in Parliament, had expected to dominate the government, and were disappointed that William denied them this chance</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Van der Zee, 296–297&lt;/ref&gt; This &quot;balanced&quot; approach to governance did not last beyond 1690, as the conflicting factions made it impossible for the government to pursue effective policy, and William called for new elections early that year</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Troost, 222; van der Zee, 301–302&lt;/ref&gt;After the Parliamentary elections of 1690, William began to favour the Tories, led by [[Thomas Osborne, 1st Duke of Leeds|Danby]] and [[Daniel Finch, 2nd Earl of Nottingham|Nottingham]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Troost, 223–227&lt;/ref&gt; While the Tories favoured preserving the king's prerogatives, William found them unaccommodating when he asked Parliament to support his continuing war with France</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Troost, 226&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, William began to prefer the Whig faction known as the [[Whig Junto|Junto]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Troost, 228–232&lt;/ref&gt; The Whig government was responsible for the creation of the [[Bank of England]] following the example of the Amsterdam Bank</span>
				<span class='text'>William's decision to grant the [[Royal Charter]] in 1694 to the Bank, a private institution owned by bankers, is his most relevant economic legacy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Claydon, 129–131&lt;/ref&gt; It laid the financial foundation of the English take-over of the central role of the [[Dutch Republic]] and [[Bank of Amsterdam]] in global commerce in the 18th century</span>
				<span class='text'>illiam dissolved Parliament in 1695, and the new Parliament that assembled that year was led by the Whigs</span>
				<span class='text'>There was a considerable surge in support for William following the exposure of a [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] plan to assassinate him in 1696</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Van der Zee, 402–403&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament passed a [[bill of attainder]] against the ringleader, [[Sir John Fenwick, 3rd Baronet|John Fenwick]], and he was beheaded in 1697</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Van der Zee, 414&lt;/ref&gt;===War in Europe===William continued to be absent from the realm for extended periods during his [[Nine Years' War]] with France, leaving each spring and returning to England each autumn</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Troost, 239–241; van der Zee, 368–369&lt;/ref&gt; England joined the League of Augsburg, which then became known as the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|Grand Alliance]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Troost, 241–246&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst William was away fighting, his wife, Mary II, governed the realm, but acted on his advice</span>
				<span class='text'>Each time he returned to England, Mary gave up her power to him without reservation, an arrangement that lasted for the rest of Mary's life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 150–158&lt;/ref&gt;After the Anglo-Dutch fleet defeated a French fleet at [[Battle of La Hougue|La Hogue]] in 1692, the allies for a short period controlled the seas, and Ireland was pacified thereafter by the [[Treaty of Limerick]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Troost, 281–283&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the Grand Alliance fared poorly in Europe, as William lost [[Namur (city)|Namur]] in the [[Spanish Netherlands]] in 1692, and was badly beaten at the [[Battle of Landen]] in 1693</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Troost, 244–246&lt;/ref&gt;==Later years==[[File:Willem III, prins van Oranje, koning van Engeland en stadhouder Rijksmuseum SK-A-367</span>
				<span class='text'>peg|thumb|William III painted in the 1690s by [[Godfried Schalcken]]]]Mary II died of smallpox on 28 December 1694, leaving William III to rule alone</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 179–180&lt;/ref&gt; William deeply mourned his wife's death</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 180–184&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his conversion to [[Anglicanism]], William's popularity plummeted during his reign as a sole monarch</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 186–192; Troost, 226–237&lt;/ref&gt;===Allegations of homosexuality===During the 1690s, rumours grew of William's alleged homosexual inclinations and led to the publication of many satirical pamphlets by his Jacobite detractors</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Culture and Society in Britain, J</span>
				<span class='text'>Black (ed</span>
				<span class='text'>, Manchester, 1997</span>
				<span class='text'>p97&lt;/ref&gt; He did have several close, male associates, including two Dutch courtiers to whom he granted English titles: [[William Bentinck, 1st Earl of Portland|Hans Willem Bentinck]] became [[Earl of Portland]], and [[Arnold Joost van Keppel, 1st Earl of Albemarle|Arnold Joost van Keppel]] was created [[Earl of Albemarle]]</span>
				<span class='text'>These relationships with male friends, and his apparent lack of mistresses, led William's enemies to suggest that he might prefer homosexual relationships</span>
				<span class='text'>William's modern biographers, however, still disagree on the veracity of these allegations</span>
				<span class='text'>Some have suggested that there may have been some truth to the rumours,&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 25–26; Van der Zee, 421–423&lt;/ref&gt; while more affirm that they were no more than figments of his enemies' imaginations, and that there was nothing unusual in someone childless like William adopting, or evincing paternal affections for, a younger man</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 204–205; Baxter, 352; James Falkner, 'Keppel, Arnold Joost van, first earl of Albemarle (1669/70–1718)', ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Bentinck's closeness to William did arouse jealousies in the Royal Court at the time, but most modern historians doubt that there was a homosexual element in their relationship</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 205&lt;/ref&gt; William's young protege, [[Arnold van Keppel, 1st Earl of Albemarle|Keppel]], aroused more gossip and suspicion, being 20 years William's junior and strikingly handsome, and having risen from being a royal page to an earldom with some ease</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 201&lt;/ref&gt; Portland wrote to William in 1697 that &quot;the kindness which your Majesty has for a young man, and the way in which you seem to authorise his liberties&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>make the world say things I am ashamed to hear&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=vdk202&gt;Van der Kiste, 202–203&lt;/ref&gt; This, he said, was &quot;tarnishing a reputation which has never before been subject to such accusations&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>William tersely dismissed these suggestions, however, saying, &quot;It seems to me very extraordinary that it should be impossible to have esteem and regard for a young man without it being criminal</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=vdk202/&gt;===Peace with France===[[Image:Lord Justices of England</span>

				<span class='text'>]In 1696, the Dutch territory of [[Drenthe]] made William its Stadtholder</span>
				<span class='text'>In the same year, [[Jacobite assassination plot 1696|Jacobites plotted]] to assassinate William III in an attempt to restore James to the English throne, but failed</span>
				<span class='text'>In accordance with the [[Treaty of Rijswijk]] (20 September 1697), which ended the [[Nine Years' War]], Louis recognised William III as King of England, and undertook to give no further assistance to James II</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Troost, 251&lt;/ref&gt; Thus deprived of French dynastic backing after 1697, Jacobites posed no further serious threats during William's reign</span>
				<span class='text'>s his life drew towards its conclusion, William, like many other European rulers, felt concern over the question of succession to the throne of Spain, which brought with it vast territories in Italy, the [[Low Countries]] and the [[New World]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The King of Spain, [[Charles II of Spain|Charles II]], was an invalid with no prospect of having children; amongst his closest relatives were Louis XIV (the King of France) and [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor]]</span>
				<span class='text'>William sought to prevent the Spanish inheritance from going to either monarch, for he feared that such a calamity would upset the [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]]</span>
				<span class='text'>William and Louis XIV agreed to the [[First Partition Treaty]], which provided for the division of the Spanish Empire: [[Duke Joseph Ferdinand of Bavaria]] would obtain Spain, while France and the Holy Roman Emperor would divide the remaining territories between them</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Troost, 253–255&lt;/ref&gt; Charles II accepted the nomination of Joseph Ferdinand as his heir, and war appeared to be averted</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Troost, 255&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:Louis XIV of France</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|alt=Portrait of Louis XIV of France, standing, wearing an ermine robed faced with fleur-de-lis|[[Louis XIV of France]] was William's lifelong enemy</span>
				<span class='text'>]When, however, Joseph Ferdinand died of smallpox, the issue re-opened</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1700, the two rulers agreed to the [[Treaty of London, 1700|Second Partition Treaty]] (also called the Treaty of London), under which the territories in Italy would pass to a son of the King of France, and the other Spanish territories would be inherited by a son of the Holy Roman Emperor</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=troost256&gt;Troost, 256–257&lt;/ref&gt; This arrangement infuriated both the Spanish, who still sought to prevent the dissolution of their empire, and the Holy Roman Emperor, to whom the Italian territories were much more useful than the other lands</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=troost256/&gt; Unexpectedly, the invalid King of Spain, Charles II, interfered as he lay dying in late 1700</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=troost258&gt;Troost, 258–260&lt;/ref&gt; Unilaterally, he willed all Spanish territories to [[Philip V of Spain|Philip]], a grandson of Louis XIV</span>
				<span class='text'>The French conveniently ignored the Second Partition Treaty and claimed the entire Spanish inheritance</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=troost258/&gt; Furthermore, Louis XIV alienated William III by recognising [[James Francis Edward Stuart]], the son of the former King James II who had died in 1701, as King of England</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Troost, 260&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent conflict, known as the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], continued until 1713</span>
				<span class='text'>==English succession===The Spanish inheritance was not the only one which concerned William</span>
				<span class='text'>His marriage with Mary II had not yielded any children, and he did not seem likely to remarry</span>
				<span class='text'>Mary's sister, [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Princess Anne]], had borne numerous children, all of whom died during childhood</span>
				<span class='text'>The death of [[Prince William, Duke of Gloucester]], in 1700 left Princess Anne as the only individual left in the line of succession established by the Bill of Rights</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Troost, 234&lt;/ref&gt; As the complete exhaustion of the line of succession would have encouraged a restoration of James II's line, Parliament passed the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], which provided that if Anne died without surviving issue and William III failed to have surviving issue by any subsequent marriage, the Crown would be inherited by a distant relative, [[Sophia of Hanover|Sophia, Electress of Hanover]], a granddaughter of King [[James VI]], and her Protestant heirs</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=troost235&gt;Troost, 235&lt;/ref&gt; The Act debarred Roman Catholics from the throne thereby excluding the candidacy of several dozen people more closely related to Mary and Anne than Sophia</span>
				<span class='text'>The Act extended to England and Ireland, but not to Scotland, whose Estates had not been consulted before the selection of Sophia</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 251–254&lt;/ref&gt; Because his horse had stumbled into a [[mole (animal)|mole's]] burrow, many Jacobites toasted &quot;the little gentleman in the black velvet waistcoat</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 255&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, Sir [[Winston Churchill]], in his ''[[A History of the English-Speaking Peoples]]'', stated that the fall &quot;opened the door to a troop of lurking foes&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>The five provinces of which William III was stadtholder—Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Gelderland and Overijssel—all suspended the office after his death</span>

				<span class='text'>This effort continued after his death during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Another important consequence of William's reign in England involved the ending of a bitter conflict between Crown and Parliament that had lasted since the accession of the first English monarch of the [[House of Stuart]], [[James I of England|James I]], in 1603</span>
