				<span class='text'>aige was a [[right-handed]] pitcher, and at age 42 in 1948, he was the oldest major league rookie while playing for the [[Cleveland Indians]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He played with the [[St</span>

				<span class='text'>He was the first player who had played in the Negro leagues to pitch in the World Series, in 1948, and was the first first electee of the Committee on Negro Baseball Leagues to be inducted in the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]], in 1971</span>

				<span class='text'>He began his [[professional baseball]] career in 1926 with the [[Chattanooga Black Lookouts]] of the [[Negro Southern League]] and became one of the most famous and successful players from the Negro leagues</span>
				<span class='text'>While his outstanding control as a pitcher first got him noticed, it was his infectious, cocky, enthusiastic personality and his love for the game that made him a star</span>
				<span class='text'>On town tours across America, Paige would have his [[infielders]] sit down behind him and then routinely [[strike out]] the side</span>

				<span class='text'>24–29, 272</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Date of birth==While Satchel Paige was playing baseball, many ages and birthdates were reported, ranging from 1900 to 1908</span>
				<span class='text'>Paige himself was the source of many of these dates</span>
				<span class='text'>His actual birthdate, July 7, 1906, was determined in 1948 when [[Cleveland Indians]] owner [[Bill Veeck]] traveled to [[Mobile, Alabama]] and accompanied Paige's family to the County Health Department to obtain his birth certificate</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tye 2009, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>viii–x</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Paige's birth certificate is displayed in his autobiography</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Paige and Lipman 1993, opposite p</span>
				<span class='text'>145</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In 1959, Paige's mother told a reporter that he was 55 rather than 53, saying she knew this because she wrote it down in her Bible</span>
				<span class='text'>Paige wrote in his autobiography, &quot;Seems like Mom's Bible would know, but she ain't ever shown me the Bible</span>
				<span class='text'>Anyway, she was in her nineties when she told the reporter that, and sometimes she tended to forget things</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Paige and Lipman 1993, p</span>
				<span class='text'>14</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Early life==Satchel was born Leroy Robert Page to &lt;!-- N</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> The surname spelling of &quot;PAGE&quot; is correct here--PLEASE don't change it to &quot;PAIGE&quot; without reading just three paragraphs down in the article how the family changed the name later --&gt;John Page, a gardener, and Lula Page (née Coleman), a domestic worker, in a section of [[Mobile, Alabama]] known as Down the Bay</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tye 2009, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>3–4, 6</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Lula and her children changed the spelling of their name from Page to Paige in the mid-1920s, just before the start of Satchel's baseball career</span>
				<span class='text'>Lula said, &quot;Page looked too much like a page in a book&quot;, whereas Satchel explained, &quot;My folks started out by spelling their name 'Page' and later stuck in the 'i' to make themselves sound more high-tone</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The introduction of the new spelling coincided with the death of Satchel's father, and may have suggested a desire for a new start</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Paige and Lipman 1993, p</span>
				<span class='text'>14; Tye 2009, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>10, 22–23</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;According to Paige, his nickname originated from childhood work toting bags at the train station</span>
				<span class='text'>He said he was not making enough money at a dime a bag, so he used a pole and rope to build a contraption that allowed him to cart up to four bags at once</span>
				<span class='text'>Another kid supposedly yelled, &quot;You look like a walking satchel tree</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Paige and Lipman 1993, p</span>
				<span class='text'>17; Tye 2009, p</span>
				<span class='text'>9</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; A different story was told by boyhood friend and neighbor, Wilber Hines, who said he gave Paige the nickname after he was caught trying to steal a bag</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tye 2009, p</span>
				<span class='text'>10</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; At the age of ten, Satchel was playing &quot;top ball&quot; which was what got him into baseball</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Top ball&quot; was a kids' game that used sticks and bottle caps instead of baseballs and bats to play a variation of the diamond sport</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tye 2009, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>8</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Satchel's mother, Lula, would even comment on how Satchel would rather &quot;play baseball than eat</span>
				<span class='text'>It was always baseball, baseball</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tye2009, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>8</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Two weeks before his thirteenth birthday, Paige was arrested for [[shoplifting]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Because this incident followed several earlier incidents of theft and [[truancy]], he was committed to the Industrial School for Negro Children in [[Mount Meigs, Alabama]], the state reform school, until the age of eighteen</span>
				<span class='text'>During the more than five years he spent at the school, he developed his pitching skills under the guidance of Edward Byrd</span>
				<span class='text'>Byrd taught Paige to kick his front foot high and to swing his arm around so it looked like his hand was in the batter's face when he released the ball</span>
				<span class='text'>Paige was released from the reform school in December 1923, six months early</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Paige and Lipman 1993, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>22–28; Tye 2009, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>14–20</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;After his release, Paige played for several Mobile semi-pro teams</span>
				<span class='text'>He joined the semi-pro [[Mobile Tigers]] where his brother Wilson was already pitching</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Paige and Lipman, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>28–32; Tye, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>21–22</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He also pitched for a semi-pro team named the Down the Bay Boys, and he recalled that he once got into a jam in the ninth inning of a 1–0 ballgame when his teammates made three consecutive errors, loading the bases for the other team with two outs</span>
				<span class='text'>Angry, Paige said he stomped around the mound, kicking up dirt</span>
				<span class='text'>The fans started booing him, so he decided that &quot;somebody was going to have to be showed up for that</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He called in his outfielders and had them sit down in the infield</span>
				<span class='text'>With the fans and his own teammates howling, Paige struck out the final batter, winning the game</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Paige and Lipman 1993, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>34–35; Tye 2009, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>23–24</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Negro leagues=====Chattanooga and Birmingham: 1926–29===A former friend from the Mobile slums, Alex Herman, was the player/manager for the [[Chattanooga Black Lookouts|Chattanooga White Sox]] of the minor [[Negro Southern League]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1926 he discovered Paige and offered to pay him $250 per month, of which Paige would collect $50 with the rest going to his mother</span>
				<span class='text'>He also agreed to pay Lula Paige a $200 advance, and she agreed to the contract</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tye 2009, p</span>
				<span class='text'>25</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The local newspapers—the ''Chattanooga News'' and ''[[Chattanooga Times]]''—recognized from the beginning that Paige was special</span>
				<span class='text'>In April 1926, shortly after his arrival, he recorded nine strikeouts over six innings against the [[Atlanta Black Crackers]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tye 2009, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>41–42</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Part way through the 1927 season, Paige's contract was sold to the [[Birmingham Black Barons]] of the major [[Negro National League (1920–31)|Negro National League]] (NNL)</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Paige's first memoir, his contract was for $450 per month, but in his second he said it was for $275</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tye 2009, p</span>
				<span class='text'>42; Paige and Lipman 1993, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>45–46</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Pitching for the Black Barons, Paige threw hard but was wild and awkward</span>
				<span class='text'>In his first big game in late June 1927, against the [[St</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis Stars (baseball)|St</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis Stars]], Paige incited a brawl when his fastball hit the hand of St</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis catcher Mitchell Murray</span>
				<span class='text'>Murray then charged the mound and Paige raced for the dugout, but Murray flung his bat and struck Paige above the hip</span>
				<span class='text'>The police were summoned, and the headline of the ''Birmingham Reporter'' proclaimed a &quot;Near Riot</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tye 2009, p</span>
				<span class='text'>43</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Paige improved and matured as a pitcher with help from his teammates, Sam Streeter and Harry Salmon, and his manager, [[Bill Gatewood]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tye 2009, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>44–45</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He finished the 1927 season 7–1 with 69 strikeouts and 26 walks in 89{{frac|1|3}} innings</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Hogan stats&quot;&gt;Hogan 2006, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>406–07</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Over the next two seasons, Paige went 12–5 and 10–9 while recording 176 strikeouts in 1929</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Hogan stats&quot;/&gt; (Several sources credit his 1929 strikeout total as the all-time single-season record for the Negro leagues, though there is variation among the sources about the exact number of strikeouts</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ribowsky 1994, p</span>
				<span class='text'>56, credits him with a record 184 strikeouts, while Holway 2001, p</span>
				<span class='text'>244, also credits him with the record, albeit with 194 strikeouts</span>
				<span class='text'>The statistics from the Hall of Fame study published by Hogan 2006, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>406–07, credit him with 176 strikeouts, which is the highest single-season total for any of the Hall of Fame or Hall-of-Fame candidate pitchers that were published in 2006, but the complete data for all pitchers were not yet available as of January 2010</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;) On April 29 of that season he recorded 17 strikeouts in a game against the [[Cuban Stars (West)|Cuban Stars]], which exceeded what was then the [[Major League Baseball|major league]] record of 16 held by [[Noodles Hahn]] and [[Rube Waddell]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Six days later he struck out 18 [[Baltimore Elite Giants|Nashville Elite Giants]], a number that was tied in the white majors by [[Bob Feller]] in 1938</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Holway 2001, p</span>
				<span class='text'>244</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Due to his increased earning potential, Barons owner R</span>
				<span class='text'>T</span>
				<span class='text'>Jackson would &quot;rent&quot; Paige out to other ball clubs for a game or two to draw a decent crowd, with both Jackson and Paige taking a cut</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ribowsky 1994, p</span>
				<span class='text'>58</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Cuba, Baltimore, and Cleveland: 1929–31===Abel Linares offered Paige $100 per game to play winter ball for the [[Leopardos de Santa Clara|Santa Clara]] team in the [[Cuban League]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Sports betting|Gambling]] on baseball games in Cuba was such a huge pastime that players were not allowed to drink alcohol, so they could stay ready to play</span>
				<span class='text'>Paige—homesick for carousing, hating the food, despising the constant inspections and being thoroughly baffled by the language—went 6–5 in Cuba</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ribowsky 1994, p</span>
				<span class='text'>61; Paige and Lipman, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>54–55; Figueredo, p</span>
				<span class='text'>183</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He left Cuba abruptly before the end of the season, with several stories told about the circumstances</span>
				<span class='text'>Paige told one version in which the mayor of a small hamlet asked him, in Spanish, if he had intentionally lost a particular game</span>
				<span class='text'>Paige, not understanding a word the man said, nodded and smiled, thinking the man was fawning over him, and then had to flee from the furious mayor</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ribowsky 1994, p</span>
				<span class='text'>61</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Another version, also told by Paige, says that when he called on an attractive local girl at her home, she and her family interpreted his attentions as an official [[engagement]] and sent the police to enforce it, leading Paige to flee the island with police in pursuit</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tye 2009, p</span>
				<span class='text'>133</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; A third version, told by the general manager of the Santa Clara Leopards, says that he left Cuba in haste after legal charges were brought against him regarding an amorous incident with &quot;a young lady from the provincial mulatto bourgeoisie</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;González Echevarría 1999, p</span>
				<span class='text'>185; Tye 2009, p</span>
				<span class='text'>133</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;When Paige returned to the United States, he and Jackson revived their practice of renting him out to various teams</span>
				<span class='text'>In the spring of 1930, Jackson leased him to the [[Baltimore Black Sox]], who had won the 1929 [[American Negro League]] championship led by their bowlegged third baseman [[Jud Wilson|Jud &quot;Boojum&quot; Wilson]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Paige, as a Southerner, found that he was an outsider on the Black Sox, and his teammates considered him a hick</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, he was the team's number two pitcher behind Lamon Yokely, and Paige did not like being overshadowed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ribowsky 1994, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>65–66</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In mid-summer Paige returned to Birmingham, where he pitched well the rest of the summer, going 7–4</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Hogan stats&quot;/&gt; In September he was leased to the [[Chicago American Giants]] of the NNL for a home-and-home series with the Houston Black Buffaloes of the Texas-Oklahoma League</span>
				<span class='text'>Paige won one and lost one in the series and then returned to Birmingham</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ribowsky 1994, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>66–68</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;By the spring of 1931, the [[Great Depression|Depression]] was taking its toll on the Negro leagues, and the Black Barons had temporarily disbanded</span>
				<span class='text'>Few teams could afford Paige, but Tom Wilson, who was moving the [[Baltimore Elite Giants|Nashville Elite Giants]] to [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] as the [[Cleveland Cubs]], thought he could</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ribowsky 1994, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>71–72; Tye 2009, p</span>
				<span class='text'>52</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Playing in the same city as a white major league team, Paige recalled, &quot;I'd look over at the Cleveland Indians' stadium, called [[League Park]] </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>All season long it burned me, playing there in the shadow of that stadium</span>
				<span class='text'>It didn't hurt my pitching, but it sure didn't do me any good</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Paige and Lipman 1993, p</span>
				<span class='text'>57</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Pittsburgh, California, and North Dakota: 1931–36===In June 1931, the [[Pittsburgh Crawfords|Crawford Colored Giants]], an independent club owned by [[Pittsburgh]] underworld figure [[Gus Greenlee]], made Paige an offer of $250 a month</span>

				<span class='text'>74, Tye 2009, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>53–58</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; On August 6, Paige made his Crawford debut against their hometown rivals, the [[Homestead Grays]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Entering the game in the fourth inning, Paige held the Grays scoreless and had six [[strikeout]]s and no [[base on balls|walks]] in five innings of [[relief pitcher|relief]] work to get the win</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ribowsky 1994, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>79–81; Tye 2009, p</span>
				<span class='text'>58</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In September, Paige joined a Negro all-star team organized by Tom Wilson, called the Philadelphia Giants, to play in the [[California Winter League]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This was the first of nine winters that he played in a league that provided ongoing competition between elite black and white baseball players, including major and minor league players</span>
				<span class='text'>On October 24 Paige won his first California game 8–1, allowing five hits and striking out 11, including [[Babe Herman]] four times</span>
				<span class='text'>He finished the winter with a 6–0 record and 70 strikeouts in 58 innings</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In 1932, Greenlee signed [[Josh Gibson]], [[Oscar Charleston]] and [[Ted Radcliffe|Ted &quot;Double Duty&quot; Radcliffe]] away from [[Cumberland Posey]]'s Homestead Grays to assemble one of the finest baseball clubs in history</span>
				<span class='text'>Paige took the mound when the Crawfords opened the season on April 30 in their newly built stadium, [[Greenlee Field]], the first completely black-owned stadium in the country</span>
				<span class='text'>Paige lost the opener to the [[New York Black Yankees]] in a pitching duel with Jesse &quot;Mountain&quot; Hubbard, but got even with them by beating them twice that season, including Paige's first Negro league [[no-hitter]] in July</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;That winter, a northern California promoter, Johnny Burton, hired Paige to front a team called the &quot;Satchel Paige All-Stars&quot;, in a game to be held on February 7, 1936 in Oakland against a white all-star squad</span>
				<span class='text'>The opposing team included a number of major league players out of the [[San Francisco, California|Bay Area]], including [[Ernie Lombardi]], [[Augie Galan]], [[Cookie Lavagetto]], and [[Gus Suhr]], as well as [[Pacific Coast League]] star [[Joe DiMaggio]], who was making his last stop as a minor leaguer before joining the [[New York Yankees]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Other than Negro league catcher, Ebel Brooks, Paige's team was composed of local semi-pro players</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite the imbalance in talent, Paige kept the game to a 1–1 tie through nine innings, striking out 12 and giving up one run on three hits</span>
				<span class='text'>In the bottom of the tenth inning, he struck out two more, then gave up a single to [[Dick Bartell]], bringing up DiMaggio</span>

				<span class='text'>Paige recruited five of his Crawfords teammates—Cool Papa Bell, Leroy Matlock, [[Sam Bankhead]], Harry Williams and Herman Andrews—as well as Josh Gibson, who had recently been traded to the Homestead Grays</span>
				<span class='text'>Other Dominican teams were also recruiting Negro league players</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In the Dominican Republic, the American players were shadowed by armed guards</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the purpose of the guards was to protect the players, the players were fearful that Trujillo would unleash them in anger if his team lost the championship</span>
				<span class='text'>The season ended with an eight-game series between the two top teams, Paige's Dragones of &quot;Ciudad Trujillo&quot; (as Trujillo had renamed the capital city of [[Santo Domingo]]) and the ''Águilas Cibaeñas'' of [[Santiago de los Caballeros|Santiago]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Dragones won the first four, with Paige contributing two of them</span>

				<span class='text'>Wilkinson purchased a [[Douglas DC-3]] airplane just to ferry Paige around to these outside appearances</span>
				<span class='text'>Because of the larger gate when Paige pitched, the Monarchs' owners could also insist on a larger share of the receipts from their road games</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilkinson and Paige each kept a share of the fees</span>
				<span class='text'>By the early 1940s, Paige's estimated annual earnings were $40,000, which was four times the pay of the average player on the major league New York Yankees and nearly matched the pay of their top star, Joe DiMaggio</span>

				<span class='text'>His tour has been described as &quot;the most ambitious baseball undertaking since [[John McGraw]] and [[Charles Comiskey]] dreamed up their round-the-world junket in 1913</span>

				<span class='text'>The tour would require 13,000 miles of travel</span>
				<span class='text'>Several same-day multi-city doubleheaders were to be played</span>

				<span class='text'>Paige and Feller each pitched three innings and left the game with the score tied 1–1</span>
				<span class='text'>Feller struck out three and gave up two hits, while Paige struck out four and gave up only one hit</span>

				<span class='text'>Paige pitched five shutout innings in Yankee Stadium before a crowd of 27,462</span>

				<span class='text'>This time, Paige was not invited to tour with him, with Feller opting to play more games in the South against white opponents</span>
				<span class='text'>Paige did face Feller twice, however, while playing with Chet Brewer's Kansas City Royals in Los Angeles</span>
				<span class='text'>In the first game, on October 15, both pitchers went four innings</span>
				<span class='text'>Feller gave up four hits and one walk and struck out two, while Paige gave up just two hits and one walk and struck out seven</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, Paige took the loss when he gave up a run in the fourth when Keltner singled and later scored on a sacrifice fly by Heath</span>
				<span class='text'>On October 19, they again faced each other in front of a crowd of 12,000-plus</span>
				<span class='text'>Both pitchers went five innings</span>
				<span class='text'>Paige allowed three hits and no walks, and struck out eight, including [[Ralph Kiner]] twice</span>

				<span class='text'>Robinson started in the minors, and had a major league team started him in its minor league affiliate, Paige would have probably seen this as an insult</span>
				<span class='text'>{According to whom|date=July 2012}} Paige eventually realized that by integrating baseball in the minor leagues first with Robinson, the white major league players got the chance to &quot;get used to&quot; the idea of playing alongside black players</span>

				<span class='text'>I'd been the guy who'd started all that big talk about letting us in the big time</span>
				<span class='text'>I’d been the one who'd opened up the major league parks to colored teams</span>
				<span class='text'>I'd been the one who the white boys wanted to go barnstorming against</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Paige, and all other black players, knew that quibbling about the choice of the first black player in the major leagues would do nothing productive, so, despite his inner feelings, Paige said of Robinson, &quot;He's the greatest colored player I've ever seen</span>

				<span class='text'>2 ERA</span>
				<span class='text'>The following year, Osborn was replaced as manager by [[Kerby Farrell]], who was not as forgiving when it came to Paige missing curfews or workouts</span>
				<span class='text'>He was fined several times throughout the year and finished 10–10, saying that he would not return to Miami the following season</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1959, Paige returned to his barnstorm roots and signed a pitching contract with the Havana Cuban Stars who were owned by Dempsey Hovland</span>
				<span class='text'>Paige was in and out of baseball, pitching sporadically, over the next decade</span>
				<span class='text'>At the age of 55, in 1961, Paige signed on with the Triple-A [[Portland Beavers]] of the [[Pacific Coast League]], pitching twenty-five innings, striking out 19 and giving up eight earned runs</span>

				<span class='text'>Paige was in the bullpen, sitting on a rocking chair, being served coffee by a &quot;nurse&quot; between innings</span>
				<span class='text'>He started the game by getting [[Jim Gosger]] out on a pop foul</span>
				<span class='text'>The next man, [[Dalton Jones]], reached first and went to second on an infield error, but was thrown out trying to reach third on a pitch in the dirt</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Carl Yastrzemski]] doubled and [[Tony Conigliaro]] hit a fly ball to end the inning</span>
				<span class='text'>The next six batters went down in order, including a strikeout of [[Bill Monbouquette]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In the fourth inning, Paige took the mound, to be removed according to plan by [[Haywood Sullivan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He walked off to a boisterous ovation despite the small crowd of 9,000</span>
				<span class='text'>The lights dimmed and, led by the PA announcer, the fans lit matches and cigarette lighters while singing &quot;The Old Gray Mare&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1966, Paige pitched in his last game in organized baseball, getting some measure of revenge when he pitched for the [[Carolina League]]'s Peninsula Grays of [[Hampton, Virginia]], against the very same [[Greensboro Patriots]] who had been forced to release him before his first pitch back in 1955</span>
				<span class='text'>Paige gave up two runs in the first, threw a scoreless second and then left, never to return as a player in organized baseball again</span>
				<span class='text'>Interestingly, Peninsula used their backup catcher that day, rather than play their regular starter, a young [[Johnny Bench]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Also in 1966, Paige pitched for the semipro Anchorage Earthquakers, a team that barnstormed through Canada</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1967, Paige appeared with the Globetrotters in Chicago and played with the [[Indianapolis Clowns]] for $1,000 a month</span>
				<span class='text'>=Pitching style==The spectacle of watching Paige pitch was made all the more entertaining by the expansive pitching repertoire he developed over the years</span>
				<span class='text'>Until 1938, Paige threw mostly hard [[fastball]]s and an occasional [[curveball]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Before the 1939 season, Paige suffered an arm injury that robbed his fastball of some velocity</span>
				<span class='text'>Paige responded by adding a [[changeup]] and experimenting with different arm angles</span>
				<span class='text'>Then, in 1943, Paige debuted the &quot;hesitation pitch&quot;:  In 1933, while playing integrated baseball in [[Bismarck, North Dakota]], ''[[The Bismarck Tribune]]'' reported that Paige used &quot;a tricky delayed delivery with great effectiveness</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Bismarck Tribune'', August 15, 1933&lt;/ref&gt;:The idea came to me in a game, when the guy at bat was all tighted up waiting for my fast ball</span>
				<span class='text'>I knew he'd swing as soon as I just barely moved</span>
				<span class='text'>So when I stretched, I paused just a little longer with my arms above my head</span>
				<span class='text'>Then I threw my left foot forward but I didn't come around with my arm right away</span>
				<span class='text'>I put that foot of mine down, stopping for a second, before the ball left my hand</span>
				<span class='text'>When my foot hit the ground that boy started swinging, so by the time I came around with the whip he was way off stride and couldn't get anywhere near the ball</span>
				<span class='text'>I had me a strikeout</span>
				<span class='text'>y the 1950s, Paige was throwing almost any pitch imaginable, including a [[screwball]], a [[knuckleball]], and an [[eephus pitch]]</span>

				<span class='text'>n 1968, Paige assumed the position of deputy sheriff in [[Jackson County, Missouri]], with the understanding that he need not bother to actually come to work in the sheriff's office</span>
				<span class='text'>The purpose of the charade was to set up Paige with political credentials</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon after, he was running for a Missouri state assembly seat with the support of the local [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] club against incumbent Representative Leon Jordan</span>

				<span class='text'>Because Paige pitched in Greensboro in 1966, he would not have been eligible for enshrinement until 1971, as players have to be out of professional baseball for at least five years before they can be elected</span>
				<span class='text'>All of the men on the committee agreed that Paige had to be the first Negro league player to get elected, so this gave Kuhn plenty of time to create some sort of Negro league branch in the Hall of Fame</span>
				<span class='text'>On February 9, 1971, Kuhn announced that Paige would be the first member of the Negro wing of the Hall of Fame</span>
				<span class='text'>Because many in the press saw the suggestion of a &quot;Negro wing&quot; as separate-but-equal and denounced major league baseball for the idea, by the time that Paige's induction came around on August 9, Kuhn convinced the owners and the private trust of the Hall of Fame that there should be no separate wing after all</span>
				<span class='text'>It was decided that all who had been chosen and all who would be chosen would get their plaques in the &quot;regular&quot; section of the Hall of Fame</span>

				<span class='text'>=Legacy==In 2010, sportswriter [[Joe Posnanski]], writing for ''Sports Illustrated'', named Paige as the hardest thrower in the history of baseball</span>
				<span class='text'>He based this, in part, on the fact that: &quot;[[Joe DiMaggio]] would say that Paige was the best he ever faced</span>
				<span class='text'>Bob Feller would say that Paige was the best he ever saw</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Hack Wilson]] would say that the ball looked like a marble when it crossed the plate</span>
				<span class='text'>Dizzy Dean would say that Paige's fastball made his own look like a changeup</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=SI-Joe-20100907/&gt; Posnanski further noted that: &quot;for most of his career Satchel Paige threw nothing but fastballs</span>
				<span class='text'>Nothing</span>
				<span class='text'>Oh, he named them different names—Bat Dodger, Midnight Rider, Midnight Creeper, Jump Ball, Trouble Ball—but essentially they were all fastballs</span>
				<span class='text'>And he was still unhittable for the better part of 15 years</span>
				<span class='text'>One pitch</span>
				<span class='text'>It's a lot like [[Mariano Rivera]], except he wasn't doing it for one inning at a time</span>
				<span class='text'>He was pitching complete games day after day</span>
				<span class='text'>That had to be some kind of incredible fastball</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> [he was] perhaps the most precise pitcher in baseball history—he threw ludicrously hard</span>

				<span class='text'>Paige, a choice Stein meant more out of sentiment than anything else, was the relief pitcher on his black team</span>
				<span class='text'>n May 31, 1981, a made-for-television movie titled ''Don’t Look Back'' aired starring [[Louis Gossett Jr</span>
				<span class='text'>] as Paige, [[Beverly Todd]] as Lahoma, and former baseball pro [[Bubba Phillips]] as Coach Hardy</span>
				<span class='text'>Paige was paid $10,000 for his story and technical advice</span>
				<span class='text'>The film was based on the 1962 book, ''[[Maybe I'll Pitch Forever]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>In August, with great difficulty because of health problems, he attended a reunion of Negro league players held in [[Ashland, Kentucky]] that paid special tribute to him and Cool Papa Bell</span>
				<span class='text'>Attending the reunion were [[Willie Mays]], Buck Leonard, Monte Irvin, [[Judy Johnson]], [[Chet Brewer]], [[Gene Benson]], Bob Feller and [[Happy Chandler]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[Buck O'Neil]], a former teammate and longtime friend of Paige, claimed in the 1994 documentary ''Baseball'' that [[Babe Ruth]] batted against Paige once</span>
				<span class='text'>According to O'Neil's story, the two men opposed each other in a barnstorming game after the Babe's retirement, and that Ruth hit a 500-foot home run off Paige</span>
				<span class='text'>O'Neil said that Paige was so awestruck by the shot that he met Ruth at the plate to shake his hand, and later had Ruth sign the ball</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Paige stated in the 1948 book, ''Pitchin' Man'' by Hal Lebovitz, that one of his greatest disappointments was, &quot;I never pitched to Babe Ruth</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; While the Babe Ruth All-Stars did play exhibition games against Negro league teams, there is no documented evidence that Paige and Ruth ever faced each other</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, there is no mention of this claim in any of the biographies on Ruth, which would surely have been worth discussing</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1996, Paige was played by [[Delroy Lindo]] in the made-for-cable film ''[[Soul of the Game]]'', which also starred [[Salli Richardson]] as Paige's second wife, Lahoma, [[Mykelti Williamson]] as Josh Gibson, [[Blair Underwood]] as Jackie Robinson, Harvey Williams of Kansas City, as &quot;Cat&quot; Mays, the father of Willie Mays, [[Edward Herrmann]] as [[Branch Rickey]] and [[Jerry Hardin]] as Commissioner [[Happy Chandler]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1999, he ranked Number 19 on ''Sporting News''{{'}} list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was nominated as a finalist for the [[Major League Baseball All-Century Team]]</span>
