				<span class='text'> he remained close to both siblings for his entire life</span>

				<span class='text'>Lalonde asserts that Trudeau's later intellectual development as an &quot;intellectual rebel, anti-establishment fighter on behalf of unions and promoter of religious freedom&quot; came from his experiences after leaving Quebec to study in the United States, France and England, and to travel to dozens of countries</span>
				<span class='text'>His international experiences allowed him to break from Jesuit influence and study French progressive Catholic philosophers such as [[Jacques Maritain]] and [[Emmanuel Mounier]] as well as [[John Locke]] and [[David Hume]]</span>

				<span class='text'>When conscripted, he decided to join the Canadian Officers' Training Corps, and he then served with the other conscripts in Canada, since they were not assigned to overseas military service until after the [[Conscription Crisis of 1944]] after the [[Invasion of Normandy]] that June</span>
				<span class='text'>Before this, all Canadians serving overseas were volunteers, and not conscripts</span>
				<span class='text'>rudeau said he was willing to fight during [[World War II]], but he believed that to do so would be to turn his back on the population of Quebec that he believed had been betrayed by the government of [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Trudeau reflected on his opposition to [[conscription]] and his doubts about the war in his ''Memoirs'' (1993): &quot;So there was a war? Tough&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>if you were a French Canadian in Montreal in the early 1940s, you did not automatically believe that this was a [[just war]]&amp;nbsp;</span>

				<span class='text'>After the war Trudeau continued his studies, first taking a master's degree in [[political economy]] at [[Harvard University]]'s [[Harvard Kennedy School|Graduate School of Public Administration]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He then studied in Paris, France in 1947 at the [[Institut d'Études Politiques de Paris]]</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1956 he edited an important book on the subject, ''La grève de l'amiante'', which argued that the strike was a seminal event in Quebec's history, marking the beginning of resistance to the conservative, [[Francophone]] clerical establishment and [[English language|Anglophone]] business class that had long ruled the province</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|English (2006)|pp=289,292}} Throughout the 1950s Trudeau was a leading figure in the opposition to the repressive rule of [[Premier of Quebec]] [[Maurice Duplessis]] as the founder and editor of ''[[Cité Libre]]'', a dissident journal that helped provide the intellectual basis for the [[Quiet Revolution]]</span>
				<span class='text'>rom 1949 to 1951 Trudeau worked briefly in Ottawa, in the [[Privy Council Office (Canada)|Privy Council Office]] of the Liberal Prime Minister [[Louis St</span>

				<span class='text'>Scott]], [[Eugene Forsey]], [[Michael Kelway Oliver]] and [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]) led to his support of and membership in that federal [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] party throughout the 1950s</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|English (2006)|p=364}} Despite these connections, when Trudeau entered federal politics in the 1960s he decided to join the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] rather than the CCF's successor, the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] (NDP)</span>
				<span class='text'>Trudeau felt the federal NDP could not achieve power, expressed doubts about the feasibility of the centralizing policies of the party, and felt that the party leadership tended toward a &quot;''deux nations''&quot; approach he could not support</span>
				<span class='text'>{{sfn|English (2006)|pp=364–365}}In his memoirs, published in 1993, Trudeau wrote that during the 1950s he wanted to teach at the Université de Montréal, but was blacklisted three times from doing so by [[Maurice Duplessis]], the then [[Premier of Quebec]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was offered a position at [[Queen's University]] teaching political science by [[James Corry (academic)|James Corry]], who later became principal of Queen's, but turned it down because he preferred to teach in Quebec</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Trudeau (1993)|pp=63–64}} During the 1950s he was [[blacklisted]] by the United States and prevented from entering that country because of a visit to a conference in Moscow, and because he subscribed to a number of [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] publications</span>

				<span class='text'>As a candidate Trudeau espoused [[participatory democracy]] as a means of making Canada a &quot;[[Just Society]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He defended vigorously the newly implemented [[universal health care]] and [[regional development]] programmes, as well as the recent reforms found in the Omnibus bill</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|English (2009)|p=145}} This annoyed public opinion in Quebec, which believed that it challenged Quebec's claim of Canada as a country of two nations</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|English (2009)|p=135}} The agreement was acceptable to the nine predominantly-English speaking provinces, while Quebec's Premier Robert Bourassa requested two weeks to consult with his cabinet</span>

				<span class='text'>He established Canadian diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, before the United States did, and went on an official visit to Beijing</span>

				<span class='text'>Stanfield proposed the immediate introduction of [[wage and price controls]] to help end the increasing [[inflation]] Canada was currently facing</span>
				<span class='text'> Trudeau mocked the proposal, saying to a newspaper reporter that it was the equivalent of a magician saying &quot;Zap! You're Frozen,&quot; and instead promoted a variety of small tax cuts to curb inflation</span>
				<span class='text'>{{sfn|English (2009)|p=237}} A campaign tour featuring Trudeau's wife and infant sons was popular, and NDP supporters scared of wage controls moved toward the Liberals</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|English (2009)|p=282}} In October 1975, in an embarrassing about-face, Trudeau and new Finance Minister [[Donald Stovel Macdonald|Donald Macdonald]] introduced wage and price controls by passing the Anti-Inflation Act</span>
				<span class='text'>The breadth of the legislation, which touched on many powers traditionally considered the purview of the provinces, prompted [[Reference re Anti-Inflation Act|a Supreme Court reference]] that only upheld the legislation as an [[Peace, Order, and Good Government|emergency requiring Federal intervention]] under the [[British North America Act]]</span>
				<span class='text'>During the annual 1975 Christmas interview with [[CTV Television Network|CTV]], Trudeau discussed the economy, citing market failures and stating that more state intervention would be necessary</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the academic wording and hypothetical solutions posed during the complex discussion led much of the public to believe he had declared capitalism itself a failure, creating a lasting distrust among increasingly [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] business leaders</span>

				<span class='text'>After a rise in the polls after the rejection of the Victoria Charter, the Quebec Liberals had taken a more confrontational approach with the Federal government on the constitution, [[Bill 22|French language laws]], and the language of [[air traffic control]] in Quebec</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|English (2009)|p=302-306}} Trudeau responded with increasing anger at what he saw as nationalist provocations against the Federal government's bilingualism and constitutional initiatives, at times expressing his personal contempt for Bourassa</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|English (2009)|p=302-306}}Partially in an attempt to shore up his support, Bourassa called a [[Quebec general election, 1976|surprise election in 1976]] that resulted in [[René Lévesque]] and the [[Parti Québécois]] (PQ) winning a majority government</span>
				<span class='text'>The PQ had chiefly campaigned on a &quot;good government&quot; platform, but promised a referendum on independence to be held within their first mandate</span>
				<span class='text'>Trudeau and Lévesque had been personal rivals, with Trudeau's intellectualism contrasting with Lévesque's more working-class image</span>
				<span class='text'>While Trudeau claimed to welcome the &quot;clarity&quot; provided by the PQ victory, the unexpected rise of the [[Quebec sovereignty movement|sovereignist movement]] became, in his view, his biggest challenge</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|English (2009)|p=308}}As the PQ began to take power, Trudeau faced the prolonged failure of his marriage, which was covered in lurid detail on a day-by-day basis by the English language press</span>

				<span class='text'>{{sfn|English (2009)|p=327-8}}As the 1970s wore on, growing public exhaustion towards Trudeau's personality and the country's constitutional debates caused his poll numbers to fall rapidly in the late 1970s</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Gwyn (1980)|p=325}} After a series of defeats in by-elections in 1978, Trudeau avoided calling the [[Canadian federal election, 1979|31st Canadian general election]] until the spring of 1979, only two months from the five-year limit provided under the [[Constitution Act, 1982|British North America Act]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Trudeau immediately initiated federal involvement in the referendum, reversing the Clark government's policy of leaving the issue to the Quebec Liberals and [[Claude Ryan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He appointed [[Jean Chrétien]] as the nominal spokesman for the federal government, helping to push the &quot;Non&quot; cause to working-class voters who tuned out the intellectual Ryan and Trudeau</span>

				<span class='text'>While mostly private about his beliefs, he made it clear that he was a believer, stating, in an interview with the ''United Church Observer'' in 1971: &quot;I believe in life after death, I believe in God and I'm a Christian</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Trudeau maintained, however, that he preferred to impose constraints on himself rather than have them imposed from the outside</span>
				<span class='text'>In this sense, he believed he was more like a Protestant than a Catholic of the era in which he was schooled</span>

				<span class='text'>Higgins, a former President of [[St</span>
				<span class='text'>Thomas University (New Brunswick)|St</span>
				<span class='text'>Thomas University]], has researched Trudeau's spirituality and finds that it incorporated elements of three Catholic traditions</span>
				<span class='text'>The first of these was the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] who provided his education up to the college level</span>
				<span class='text'>Trudeau frequently displayed the logic and love of argument consistent with that tradition</span>
				<span class='text'>A second great spiritual influence in Trudeau's life was [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Michel Gorges, Rector of the [[Dominican University College]], Trudeau &quot;considered himself a lay Dominican</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He studied philosophy under Dominican Father [[Louis-Marie Régis]] and remained close to him throughout his life, regarding Régis as &quot;spiritual director and friend</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Another skein in Trudeau's spirituality was a [[Contemplation|contemplative]] aspect acquired from his association with the [[Benedictine]] tradition</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Higgins, Trudeau was convinced of the centrality of [[Christian meditation|meditation]] in a life fully lived</span>
				<span class='text'>He took retreats at [[Saint-Benoît-du-Lac, Quebec]] and regularly attended [[Liturgy of the Hours|Hours]] and the [[Eucharist]] at Montreal's Benedictine community</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Trudeau's most enduring legacy may lie in his contribution to [[Canadian nationalism]], and of pride in Canada in and for itself rather than as a derivative of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His role in this effort, and his related battles with Quebec on behalf of Canadian unity, cemented his political position when in office despite the controversies he faced—and remain the most remembered aspect of his tenure afterwards</span>
				<span class='text'>ome consider Trudeau's economic policies to have been a weak point</span>
				<span class='text'>Inflation and unemployment marred much of his tenure as prime minister</span>
				<span class='text'>When Trudeau took office in 1968 Canada had a debt of $18&amp;nbsp;billion (24% of GDP) which was largely left over from World War II, when he left office in 1984, that debt stood at $200&amp;nbsp;billion (46% of GDP), an increase of 83% in real terms</span>

				<span class='text'>df Centre for the Study of Living Standard]—GDP figures&lt;/ref&gt; However, these trends were present in most western countries at the time, including the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>hough his popularity had fallen in English Canada at the time of his retirement in 1984, public opinion later became more sympathetic to him, particularly in comparison to his successor, [[Brian Mulroney]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ierre Trudeau is today seen in very high regard on the Canadian political scene</span>
				<span class='text'>Many politicians still use the term &quot;taking a walk in the snow&quot;, the line Trudeau used to describe his decision to leave office in 1984</span>
				<span class='text'>Other popular Trudeauisms frequently used are &quot;[[just watch me]]&quot;, the &quot;[[Finger (gesture)|Trudeau Salute]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Fuddle duddle|Fuddle Duddle]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>==Constitutional legacy===One of Trudeau's most enduring legacies is the 1982 patriation of the Canadian constitution, including a domestic amending formula and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms</span>
				<span class='text'>It is seen as advancing [[civil rights]] and liberties and has become a cornerstone of Canadian values for most Canadians</span>
				<span class='text'>It also represented the final step in Trudeau's liberal vision of a fully independent and nationalist Canada based on fundamental human rights and the protection of individual freedoms as well as those of linguistic and cultural minorities</span>
				<span class='text'>Court challenges based on the Charter of Rights have been used to advance the cause of women's equality, re-establish French school boards in provinces such as Alberta and Saskatchewan, and to mandate the adoption of [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|same-sex marriage]] all across Canada</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Section Thirty-five of the Constitution Act, 1982|Section 35]] of the [[Constitution Act, 1982]], has clarified issues of aboriginal and equality rights, including establishing the previously denied aboriginal rights of [[Metis (people)|Métis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Section 15, dealing with equality rights, has been used to remedy societal discrimination against minority groups</span>
				<span class='text'>The coupling of the direct and indirect influences of the charter has meant that it has grown to influence every aspect of Canadian life and the override (notwithstanding clause) of the charter has been infrequently used</span>
				<span class='text'>[Canadian conservatism|Canadian conservatives]] claim the constitution has resulted in too much [[judicial activism]] on the part of the courts in Canada</span>
				<span class='text'>It is also heavily criticized by [[Quebec nationalism|Quebec nationalists]], who resent that the 1982 amendments to the constitution were never ratified by any [[Politics of Quebec|Quebec government]] and the constitution does not recognize a constitutional veto for [[Quebec]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==Bilingualism==={{See also|Bilingualism in Canada}}Bilingualism is one of Trudeau's most lasting accomplishments, having been fully integrated into the Federal government's services, documents, and broadcasting (not, however, in provincial governments, except for Ontario, New Brunswick, and Manitoba)</span>
				<span class='text'>While official bilingualism has settled some of the grievances Francophones had towards the federal government, many Francophones had hoped that Canadians would be able to function in the official language of their choice no matter where in the country they were</span>
				<span class='text'>owever, Trudeau's ambitions in this arena have been overstated: Trudeau once said that he regretted the use of the term &quot;bilingualism&quot;, because it appeared to demand that all Canadians speak two languages</span>
				<span class='text'>In fact, Trudeau's vision was to see Canada as a bilingual confederation in which ''all'' cultures would have a place</span>
				<span class='text'>In this way, his conception broadened beyond simply the relationship of Quebec to Canada</span>
				<span class='text'>==Multiculturalism===On October 8, 1971, Pierre Trudeau introduced the Multiculturalism Policy in the House of Commons</span>
				<span class='text'> It was the first of its kind in the world, and was then emulated in several provinces, such as Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and other countries most notably Australia, which has had a similar history and immigration pattern</span>
				<span class='text'> Beyond the specifics of the policy itself, this action signalled an openness to the world and coincided with a more open immigration policy that had been brought in by Trudeau's predecessor Lester B</span>
				<span class='text'>Pearson (with the help of legendary mandarin, Tom Kent)</span>
				<span class='text'>==Cultural legacy===Few outside the museum community recall the tremendous efforts Trudeau made, in the last years of his tenure, to see to it that the [[National Gallery of Canada]] and the [[Canadian Museum of Civilization]] finally had proper homes in the national capital region</span>
				<span class='text'>The Trudeau government also implemented programs which mandated [[Canadian content]] in film, and broadcasting, and gave substantial subsidies to develop the Canadian media and cultural industries</span>
				<span class='text'>Though the policies remain controversial, Canadian media industries have become stronger since Trudeau's arrival</span>
				<span class='text'>urthermore, his cultural legacy can be found in Canada's strong ties to [[multiculturalism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==Legacy with respect to western Canada===Trudeau's posthumous reputation in the Western Provinces is notably less favourable than in the rest of English-speaking Canada, and he is sometimes regarded as the &quot;father of [[Western alienation]]</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;  To many westerners, Trudeau's policies seemed to favour other parts of the country, especially [[Ontario]] and Quebec, at their expense</span>
				<span class='text'>Outstanding among such policies was the [[National Energy Program]], which was seen as unfairly depriving western provinces of the full economic benefit from their oil and gas resources, in order to pay for nationwide social programs, and make regional transfer payments to poorer parts of the country</span>
				<span class='text'>Sentiments of this kind were especially strong in oil-rich [[Alberta]] where unemployment rose from 4% to 10% following passage of the NEP</span>

				<span class='text'>During a visit to [[Saskatoon]], Saskatchewan on July 17, 1969, Trudeau met with a group of farmers who were protesting the [[Canadian Wheat Board]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The widely remembered perception is that Trudeau dismissed the protesters' concerns with  &quot;Why should ''I'' sell your wheat?&quot; – however, he had asked the [[rhetorical question|question rhetorically]] and then proceeded to answer it himself</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Legacy with respect to Quebec===Trudeau's legacy in Quebec is mixed</span>
				<span class='text'>Many credit his actions during the [[October Crisis]] as crucial in terminating the [[Front de libération du Québec]] (FLQ) as a force in Quebec, and ensuring that the campaign for Quebec separatism took a democratic and peaceful route</span>
				<span class='text'>However, his [[War Measures Act#The October Crisis|imposition of the War Measures Act]]—which received majority support at the time—is remembered by some in Quebec and elsewhere as an attack on democracy</span>
				<span class='text'>Trudeau is also credited by many for the defeat of the [[1980 Quebec referendum]]</span>
				<span class='text'>t the federal level, Trudeau faced almost no strong political opposition in Quebec during his time as Prime Minister</span>
				<span class='text'>For instance, his Liberal party captured 74 out of 75 Quebec seats in the [[Canadian federal election, 1980|1980 federal election]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Provincially, though, Québécois twice elected the pro-sovereignty [[Parti Québécois]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, there were not at that time any pro-sovereignty federal parties such as the [[Bloc Québécois]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Since the signing of the [[Constitution Act, 1982|Constitutional Act of Canada]] in 1982 and until 2015, the Liberal Party of Canada had not succeeded in winning a majority of seats in Quebec</span>
				<span class='text'>Trudeau was disliked by the Quebecois nationalists</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Intellectual contributions===Trudeau made a number of contributions throughout his career to the intellectual discourse of Canadian politics</span>
				<span class='text'>Trudeau was a strong advocate for a [[federalism|federalist]] model of government in Canada, developing and promoting his ideas in response and contrast to strengthening Quebec nationalist movements, for instance the social and political atmosphere created during [[Maurice Duplessis]]' time in power</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gagnon (2000)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=August 2012}}   Federalism in this context can be defined as &quot;a particular way of sharing political power among different peoples within a state</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>hose who believe in federalism hold that different peoples do not need states of their own in order to enjoy self-determination</span>
				<span class='text'>Peoples</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>ay agree to share a single state while retaining substantial degrees of self-government over matters essential to their identity as peoples&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ignatieff, quoted in Balthazar (1995), p</span>
				<span class='text'>6</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=August 2012}}   As a social democrat, Trudeau sought to combine and harmonize his theories on [[social democracy]] with those of federalism so that both could find effective expression in Canada</span>
				<span class='text'>He noted the ostensible conflict between socialism, with its usually strong centralist government model, and federalism, which expounded a division and cooperation of power by both federal and provincial levels of government</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|English (2009)|p=?}} In particular, Trudeau stated the following about socialists:{{quote|[R]ather than water down</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>heir socialism, must constantly seek ways of adapting it to a bicultural society governed under a federal constitution</span>
				<span class='text'>And since the future of Canadian federalism lies clearly in the direction of co-operation, the wise socialist will turn his thoughts in that direction, keeping in mind the importance of establishing buffer zones of joint sovereignty and co-operative zones of joint administration between the two levels of government{{sfn|English (2009)|p=141}}}}Trudeau pointed out that in sociological terms, Canada is inherently a federalist society, forming unique regional identities and priorities, and therefore a federalist model of spending and jurisdictional powers is most appropriate</span>
				<span class='text'>He argues, &quot;in the age of the mass society, it is no small advantage to foster the creation of quasi-sovereign communities at the provincial level, where power is that much less remote from the people</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|English (2009)|p=133}}Unfortunately, Trudeau's idealistic plans for a cooperative Canadian federalist state were resisted and hindered as a result of his narrowness on ideas of identity and socio-cultural pluralism: &quot;While the idea of a 'nation' in the sociological sense is acknowledged by Trudeau, he considers the allegiance which it generates—emotive and particularistic—to be contrary to the idea of cohesion between humans, and as such creating fertile ground for the internal fragmentation of states and a permanent state of conflict&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=August 2012}}   This position garnered significant criticism for Trudeau, in particular from Quebec and First Nations peoples on the basis that his theories denied their rights to nationhood</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Gagnon2000pp16-17&quot;/&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=August 2012}}   First Nations communities raised particular concerns with the proposed [[1969 White Paper]], developed under Trudeau by [[Jean Chrétien]]</span>
