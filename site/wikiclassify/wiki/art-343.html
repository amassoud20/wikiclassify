				<span class='text'>He was the third child of Jean-Joseph Pasteur and Jeanne-Etiennette Roqui</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1827, the family moved to [[Arbois]], where he entered primary school in 1831</span>
				<span class='text'>He was an average student in his early years, and not particularly academic, as his interests were [[fishing]] and [[sketch (drawing)|sketch]]ing</span>
				<span class='text'>His pastels and portraits of his parents and friends, made when he was 15, were later kept in the museum of the Pasteur Institute in [[Paris]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1838, he left for Paris to join the Institution Barbet, but became homesick and returned in November</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1839, he entered the Collège Royal de Besançon and earned his ''[[baccalauréat]]'' ([[Bachelor of Arts|BA]]) degree in 1840</span>
				<span class='text'>He was appointed teaching assistant at the Besançon college while continuing a degree science course with special mathematics</span>
				<span class='text'>He failed his first examination in 1841</span>
				<span class='text'>He managed to pass the ''baccalauréat scientifique'' (general science) degree in 1842 from Dijon but with a poor grade in chemistry</span>
				<span class='text'>After one failed attempt for the entrance test for the ''[[École Normale Supérieure]]'' in Paris in 1842, he succeeded in 1844</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1845 he received the ''licencié ès sciences'' (Bachelor of Science) degree</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1846, he was appointed professor of physics at the Collège de Tournon (now called {{Ill|fr|Lycée Gabriel-Faure}}) in [[Ardèche]], but [[Antoine Jérome Balard]] (one of the discoverers of the element bromine) wanted him back at the ''École Normale Supérieure'' as a graduate assistant (préparateur) for chemistry courses</span>
				<span class='text'>He joined Balard and simultaneously started his research in [[crystallography]] and in 1847, he submitted his two theses, one in chemistry and the other in physics</span>
				<span class='text'>After serving briefly as professor of physics at the Dijon [[Lycée]] in 1848, he became professor of chemistry at the [[University of Strasbourg]], where he met and courted [[Marie Laurent]], daughter of the university's [[Rector (academia)|rector]] in 1849</span>
				<span class='text'>They were married on May 29, 1849, and together had five children, only two of whom survived to adulthood; the other three died of [[typhoid]]</span>

				<span class='text'>However, he did not know that yeasts were organisms</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Hume/&gt; In 1855, [[Antoine Béchamp]], Professor of Chemistry at the University of Montpellier, showed that sugar was converted to [[sucrose]] and [[fructose]] in a closed bottle containing water and when he added [[calcium]] or [[zinc chloride]] to it, no reaction occurred</span>
				<span class='text'>He also noticed moulds developing in the solution, but could not fathom the significance of it</span>
