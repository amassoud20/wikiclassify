				<span class='text'>loyd Webber started writing his own music at a young age, a [[suite (music)|suite]] of six pieces at the age of nine</span>
				<span class='text'>He also put on &quot;productions&quot; with Julian and his Aunt Viola in his toy theatre (which he built at Viola's suggestion)</span>
				<span class='text'>Later, he would be the owner of a number of West End theatres, including the [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His aunt Viola, an actress, took him to see many of her shows and through the stage door into the world of the theatre</span>
				<span class='text'>He also had originally set music to [[Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats]] at the age of 15</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1965, Lloyd Webber was a [[Queen's Scholar]] at [[Westminster School]] and studied history for a term at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], although he abandoned the course in Winter 1965 to study at the [[Royal College of Music]] and pursue his interest in musical theatre</span>

				<span class='text'> 1989&lt;/ref&gt;==Professional career=====Early years===Lloyd Webber's first collaboration with lyricist [[Tim Rice]] was ''[[The Likes of Us]]'', a musical based on the true story of [[Thomas John Barnardo]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Although composed in 1965, it was not publicly performed until 2005, when a production was staged at Lloyd Webber's [[Sydmonton Festival]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 2008, amateur rights were released by the National Operatic and Dramatic Association (NODA) in association with the Really Useful Group</span>
				<span class='text'>The first amateur performance was by a children's theatre group in Cornwall called &quot;Kidz R Us&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Stylistically, ''The Likes of Us'' is fashioned after the Broadway musical of the 1940s and 1950s; it opens with a traditional overture comprising a medley of tunes from the show, and the score reflects some of Lloyd Webber's early influences, particularly [[Richard Rodgers]], [[Frederick Loewe]], and [[Lionel Bart]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In this respect, it is markedly different from the composer's later work, which tends to be either predominantly or wholly [[through-composed]], and closer in form to opera than to the Broadway musical</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1968, Rice and Lloyd Webber were commissioned to write a piece for the [[Colet Court]] preparatory school, which resulted in ''[[Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat]]'', a retelling of the biblical story of Joseph in which Lloyd Webber and Rice humorously pastiche a number of musical styles such as Elvis-style rock'n'roll, [[Calypso music|Calypso]] and [[country music]]</span>
				<span class='text'>''Joseph'' began life as a short [[cantata]] that gained some recognition on its second staging with a favourable review in ''[[The Times]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>For its subsequent performances, Rice and Lloyd Webber revised the show and added new songs to expand it to a more substantial length</span>
				<span class='text'>This culminated in a two-hour-long production being staged in the West End on the back of the success of ''Jesus Christ Superstar''</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1969 Rice and Lloyd Webber wrote a song for the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] called &quot;Try It and See,&quot; which was not selected</span>
				<span class='text'>With rewritten lyrics it became &quot;King Herod's Song&quot; in their third musical, ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' (1970)</span>
				<span class='text'>he planned follow-up to ''Jesus Christ Superstar'' was a musical comedy based on the [[Jeeves and Wooster]] novels by [[P</span>
				<span class='text'>G</span>
				<span class='text'>Wodehouse]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Tim Rice was uncertain about this venture, partly because of his concern that he might not be able to do justice to the novels that he and Lloyd Webber so admired</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;(Rice, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; After doing some initial work on the lyrics, he pulled out of the project and Lloyd Webber subsequently wrote the musical with [[Alan Ayckbourn]], who provided the book and lyrics</span>
				<span class='text'>''Jeeves'' failed to make any impact at the box office and closed after a short run of only three weeks</span>
				<span class='text'>Many years later, Lloyd Webber and Ayckbourn revisited this project, producing a thoroughly reworked and more successful version entitled ''[[By Jeeves]]'' (1996)</span>
				<span class='text'>Only two of the songs from the original production remained (&quot;Half a Moment&quot; and &quot;Banjo Boy&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>==Mid-1970s===Lloyd Webber collaborated with Rice once again to write ''[[Evita (musical)|Evita]]'' (1978 in London/1979 in U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>, a musical based on the life of [[Eva Perón]]</span>
				<span class='text'>As with ''Jesus Christ Superstar'', Evita was released first as a concept album (1976) and featured [[Julie Covington]] singing the part of Eva Perón</span>
				<span class='text'>The song &quot;[[Don't Cry for Me Argentina]]&quot; became a hit single and the musical was staged at the [[Prince Edward Theatre]] in a production directed by [[Harold Prince]] and starring [[Elaine Paige]] in the title role</span>
				<span class='text'>[Patti Lupone|Patti LuPone]] created the role of Eva on Broadway for which she won a Tony</span>
				<span class='text'> ''Evita'' was a highly successful show that ran for ten years in the West End</span>
				<span class='text'>It transferred to Broadway in 1979</span>
				<span class='text'>Rice and Lloyd Webber parted ways soon after ''Evita''</span>
				<span class='text'>In an interview in 2011, LuPone commented &quot;He writes crap music</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>''Evita'' was his best score, ''Evita'' in its bizarreness - when I first heard it I thought 'I swear to God, he hated women' [</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> There are some very romantic moments in his music, and there is some real</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>rash that he doesn't even think about parting with</span>
				<span class='text'>He's not a very good editor of his own stuff</span>

				<span class='text'>24 (Paganini)|24th Caprice by Paganini]], which reached number two in the pop album chart in the United Kingdom</span>
				<span class='text'>The main theme was used as the theme tune for [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s long-running ''[[South Bank Show]]'' throughout its 32-year run</span>
				<span class='text'>==1980s===Lloyd Webber was the subject of ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' in November 1980 when he was surprised by [[Eamonn Andrews]] in the foyer of Thames Television's Euston Road Studios</span>
				<span class='text'>He would be honoured a second time by the television programme in November 1994 when [[Michael Aspel]] surprised him at the [[Adelphi Theatre]]</span>

				<span class='text'>''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' (1981) was to become the longest running musical in London, where it ran for 21 years before closing</span>
				<span class='text'>On Broadway, ''Cats'' ran for 18 years, a record which would ultimately be broken by another Lloyd Webber musical, ''The Phantom of the Opera''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{ibdb title|4186|Cats}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BroadwayLength&gt;{{ibdb title|4491|The Phantom of the Opera}}&lt;/ref&gt;''[[Starlight Express]]'' (1984) was a commercial hit, but received negative reviews from the critics</span>
				<span class='text'>It enjoyed a record run in the West End, but ran for less than two years on Broadway</span>
				<span class='text'>The show has also seen two tours of the US, as well as an Australian/Japanese production, a three-year UK touring production, which transferred to New Zealand later in 2009</span>
				<span class='text'>The show also runs full-time in a custom-built theatre in [[Bochum]], Germany, where it has been running since 1988</span>
				<span class='text'>loyd Webber wrote a [[Requiem Mass]] dedicated to his father, William, who had died in 1982</span>
				<span class='text'>It premiered at St</span>
				<span class='text'>Thomas Church in New York on 24 February 1985</span>
				<span class='text'>Church music had been a part of the composer's upbringing and the composition was inspired by an article he had read about the plight of Cambodian orphans</span>
				<span class='text'>Lloyd Webber had on a number of occasions written sacred music for the annual [[Sydmonton Festival]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Snelson, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Lloyd Webber received a [[Grammy Award]] in 1986 for ''Requiem'' in the category of best classical composition</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[Pie Jesu]]'' from Requiem achieved a high placing on the UK pop charts</span>
				<span class='text'>Perhaps because of its large orchestration, live performances of the Requiem are rare</span>
				<span class='text'>'[[Cricket (musical)|Cricket]]'' (1986), also called ''Cricket (Hearts and Wickets)'', reunited Lloyd Webber with Tim Rice to create this short musical for [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth]]'s 60th birthday, first performed at [[Windsor Castle]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Several of the tunes were later used for ''Aspects of Love'' and ''Sunset Boulevard''</span>
				<span class='text'>loyd Webber also premiered ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' in 1986, inspired by the [[The Phantom of the Opera|1911 Gaston Leroux novel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote the part of Christine for his then-wife, [[Sarah Brightman]], who played the role in the original London and Broadway productions alongside [[Michael Crawford]] as the Phantom</span>
				<span class='text'>The production was directed by Harold Prince, who had also earlier directed ''Evita</span>
				<span class='text'>' [[Charles Hart (lyricist)|Charles Hart]] wrote the lyrics for ''Phantom'' with some additional material provided by [[Richard Stilgoe]], with whom Lloyd-Webber co-wrote the book of the musical</span>
				<span class='text'>It became a hit and is still running in both the West End and on Broadway; in January 2006 it overtook ''Cats'' as the longest-running musical on Broadway</span>
				<span class='text'>On 11 February 2012, ''Phantom of the Opera'' played its 10,000th show on Broadway</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=BroadwayLength /&gt;''[[Aspects of Love]]'' followed in 1989, a musical based on the story by [[David Garnett]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The lyrics were by [[Don Black (lyricist)|Don Black]] and Charles Hart and the original production was directed by Trevor Nunn</span>
				<span class='text'>''Aspects'' had a run of four years in London, but closed after less than a year on Broadway</span>
				<span class='text'>It has since gone on a tour of the UK</span>
				<span class='text'>==1990s===Lloyd Webber was asked to write a song for the [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Barcelona Olympics]] and composed &quot;[[Amigos Para Siempre]]&amp;nbsp;— Friends for Life&quot; with Don Black providing the lyrics</span>
				<span class='text'>This song was performed by [[Sarah Brightman]] and [[José Carreras]]</span>
				<span class='text'>loyd Webber had toyed with the idea of writing a musical based on [[Billy Wilder]]'s critically acclaimed movie, ''[[Sunset Boulevard (1950 film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'', since the early 1970s when he saw the film, but the project didn't come to fruition until after the completion of ''Aspects of Love'' when the composer finally managed to secure the rights from [[Paramount Pictures]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lloyd Webber, Andrew: ''Inspired By Sunset Boulevard'' Really Useful Group |url=http://reallyuseful</span>

				<span class='text'>The show opened at the [[Adelphi Theatre]] in London on 12 July 1993, and ran for 1,529 performances</span>
				<span class='text'>In spite of the show's popularity and extensive run in London's West End, it lost money due to the sheer expense of the production</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1994, ''Sunset Boulevard'' became a successful Broadway show, opening with the largest advance in Broadway history, and winning seven Tony Awards that year</span>
				<span class='text'>Even so, by its closing in 1997, &quot;it had not recouped its reported $13&amp;nbsp;million investment</span>

				<span class='text'>97&lt;/ref&gt;In 1998, Lloyd Webber released a film version of &quot;Cats&quot;, which was filmed at the Adelphi Theatre in London</span>
				<span class='text'>David Mallet directed the film, and Gillian Lynne choreographed it</span>
				<span class='text'>The cast consisted of performers who had been in the show before, including Ken Page (the original Old Deuteronomy on Broadway), Elaine Paige (original Grizabella in London) and Sir John Mills as Gus: the Theatre Cat</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1998 ''[[Whistle Down the Wind (musical)|Whistle Down the Wind]]'' made its debut, a musical written with lyrics supplied by Jim Steinman</span>
				<span class='text'>Originally opening in Washington, Lloyd Webber was reportedly not happy with the casting or Harold Prince's production and the show was subsequently revised for a London staging directed by Gale Edwards, the production is probably most notable for the number-one hit from Boyzone &quot;No Matter What&quot; which left only the UK charts when the price of the CD single was changed to drop it out of the official top ten</span>
				<span class='text'>His ''[[The Beautiful Game (musical)|The Beautiful Game]]'' opened in London and has never been seen on Broadway</span>
				<span class='text'>The show had a respectable run at The Cambridge Theatre in London</span>
				<span class='text'>The show has been re-worked into a new musical, ''The Boys in the Photograph'', which had its world première at [[The Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts]] in April 2008</span>
				<span class='text'>==2000s===Having achieved great popular success in musical theatre, Lloyd Webber was referred to by ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2001 as &quot;the most commercially successful composer in history</span>
