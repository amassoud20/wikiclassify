				<span class='text'>In an election petition filed by [[Raj Narain]] (who later on defeated her in 1977 parliamentary election from [[Raebareli|Rae Bareily]]), he had alleged several major as well as minor instances of using government resources for campaigning</span>

				<span class='text'>The Prime Minister must be a member of either the [[Lok Sabha]] (the lower house in the [[Parliament of India]]) or the [[Rajya Sabha]] (the upper house)</span>

				<span class='text'>It came almost four years after the case was brought by Raj Narain, the premier's defeated opponent in the 1971 parliamentary election</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Jaffrelot&quot;/&gt; Armed with the power to rule by decree and without constitutional constraints, Gandhi embarked on a massive redistribution program</span>
