				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Banville/&gt; The posthumous publication by [[Anthony Thwaite]] in 1992 of his [[Selected Letters of Philip Larkin, 1940–1985|letters]] triggered controversy about his personal life and political views, described by [[John Banville]] as hair-raising, but also in places hilarious</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Banville&gt;Banville 2006</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; [[Lisa Jardine]] called him a &quot;casual, habitual racist, and an easy [[Misogyny|misogynist]]&quot;, but the academic John Osborne argued in 2008 that &quot;the worst that anyone has discovered about Larkin are some crass letters and a taste for porn softer than what passes for mainstream entertainment&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>28, 31</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, when he joined Coventry's King Henry VIII Junior School he fitted in immediately and made close, long-standing friendships, such as those with James &quot;Jim&quot; Sutton, Colin Gunner and Noel &quot;Josh&quot; Hughes</span>
				<span class='text'>Although home life was relatively cold, Larkin enjoyed support from his parents</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, his deep passion for [[jazz]] was supported by the purchase of a drum kit and a [[saxophone]], supplemented by a subscription to ''[[Down Beat]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>From the junior school he progressed to King Henry VIII Senior School</span>
				<span class='text'>He fared quite poorly when he sat his [[School Certificate (UK)|School Certificate]] exam at the age of 16</span>

				<span class='text'>68–9</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, Ruth went to continue her studies at [[King's College London]]; during one of his visits their friendship developed into a sexual relationship</span>
				<span class='text'>By June 1946, Larkin was halfway through qualifying for membership of the [[Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals|Library Association]] and was appointed assistant librarian at [[University College, Leicester]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It was visiting Larkin in Leicester and witnessing the university's [[Common room (university)|Senior Common Room]] that gave Kingsley Amis the inspiration to write ''[[Lucky Jim]]'' (1954), the novel that made Amis famous and to whose long gestation Larkin contributed considerably</span>

				<span class='text'>Before his departure he and Ruth split up</span>
				<span class='text'> At some stage between the appointment to the position at Queen's and the end of the engagement to Ruth, Larkin's friendship with [[Relationships that influenced Philip Larkin#Monica Jones|Monica Jones]], a lecturer in English at Leicester, also developed into a sexual relationship</span>
				<span class='text'>He spent five years in Belfast, which appear to have been the most contented of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>While his relationship with Jones developed, he also had &quot;the most satisfyingly erotic [affair] of his life&quot; with [[Patsy Strang]], who at the time was in an [[open marriage]] with one of his colleagues</span>

				<span class='text'>While in Belfast he also had a significant though sexually undeveloped friendship with Winifred Arnott, the subject of &quot;Lines on a Young Lady's Photograph Album&quot;, which came to an end when she married in 1954</span>

				<span class='text'>When Larkin took up his appointment there, the plans for a new university library were already far advanced</span>

				<span class='text'>Auden, and fiction: he wrote five full-length novels, each of which he destroyed shortly after completion</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bradford 2005, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>32–34</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; While he was at Oxford University he had a poem published for the first time: &quot;Ultimatum&quot; in ''[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Around this time he developed a pseudonymous alter ego for his prose, [[Brunette Coleman]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Under this name he wrote two novellas, ''Trouble at Willow Gables'' and ''Michaelmas Term at St Brides'' (2002), as well as a supposed autobiography and an equally fictitious creative manifesto called &quot;What we are writing for&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Richard Bradford has written that these curious works show &quot;three registers: cautious indifference, archly overwritten symbolism with a hint of Lawrence and prose that appears to disclose its writer's involuntary feelings of sexual excitement&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bradford 2005, p</span>

				<span class='text'>55</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Around the time that ''Jill'' was being prepared for publication, Caton inquired of Larkin if he also wrote poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>This resulted in the publication, three months before ''Jill'', of ''[[The North Ship]]'' (1945), a collection of poems written between 1942 and 1944 which showed the increasing influence of [[William Butler Yeats|Yeats]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Immediately after completing ''Jill'', Larkin started work on the novel ''A Girl in Winter'' (1947), completing it in 1945</span>
				<span class='text'>This was published by [[Faber and Faber]] and was well received, ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' calling it &quot;an exquisite performance and nearly faultless&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The bulk of his next published collection of poems ''[[The Less Deceived]]'' (1955) was written there, though eight of the twenty-nine poems included were from the late 1940s</span>
				<span class='text'>This period also saw Larkin make his final attempts at writing prose fiction, and he gave extensive help to Kingsley Amis with ''[[Lucky Jim]]'', which was Amis's first published novel</span>

				<span class='text'>During his first five years in Hull the pressures of work slowed Larkin's output to an average of just two-and-a-half poems a year, but this period saw the writing of some of his best-known poems, such as &quot;[[An Arundel Tomb]]&quot;, &quot;[[The Whitsun Weddings]]&quot; and &quot;Here&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Its more direct use of language meant that it did not meet with uniform praise; nonetheless it sold over twenty thousand copies in its first year alone</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; yet it contains a number of his much-loved pieces, including &quot;[[This Be The Verse]]&quot; and &quot;The Explosion&quot;, as well as the [[High Windows (poem)|title poem]]</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Annus Mirabilis&quot; (Year of Wonder), also from that volume, contains the frequently quoted observation that sexual intercourse began in 1963, which the narrator claims was &quot;rather late for me&quot;: this despite Larkin having started his own sexual career in 1945</span>
				<span class='text'>Bradford, prompted by comments in Maeve Brennan's memoir, suggests that the poem commemorates Larkin's relationship with Brennan moving from the romantic to the sexual</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Larkin is the most widely celebrated and arguably the finest poet of the Movement,&quot; states Keith Tuma, and his poetry is &quot;more various than its reputation for dour pessimism and anecdotes of a disappointed middle class suggests&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Tuma 2001, p</span>
				<span class='text'>445&quot;/&gt;Stephen Cooper's ''Philip Larkin: Subversive Writer'' and John Osborne's &quot;Larkin, Ideology and Critical Violence&quot; suggest the changing temper of Larkin studies, the latter attacking eminent critics such as James Booth and Anthony Thwaite for their readiness to reduce to poems to works of biography, and stressing instead the genius of Larkin's universality and deconstructionism</span>
				<span class='text'>Cooper argues that &quot;The interplay of signs and motifs in the early work orchestrates a subversion of conventional attitudes towards class, gender, authority and sexual relations&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cooper 2004, p</span>
				<span class='text'>1</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Cooper identifies Larkin as a progressive writer, and perceives in the letters a &quot;plea for alternative constructs of masculinity, femininity and social and political organisation&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cooper 2004, p</span>
				<span class='text'>2</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Cooper draws on the entire canon of Larkin's works, as well as on unpublished correspondence, to counter the image of Larkin as merely a racist, misogynist reactionary</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead he identifies in Larkin what he calls a &quot;subversive imagination&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cooper 2004, p</span>
				<span class='text'>3</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He highlights in particular &quot;Larkin's objections to the hypocrisies of conventional sexual politics that hamper the lives of both sexes in equal measure&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cooper 2004, p</span>
				<span class='text'>179</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In similar vein to Cooper, Stephen Regan notes in an essay entitled &quot;Philip Larkin: a late modern poet&quot; that Larkin frequently embraces devices associated with the experimental practices of [[Modernism]], such as &quot;linguistic strangeness, self-conscious literariness, radical self-questioning, sudden shifts of voice and register, complex viewpoints and perspectives, and symbolist intensity&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Corcoran 2007, p</span>
				<span class='text'>149</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;A further indication of a new direction in the critical valuation of Larkin is S</span>
				<span class='text'>K</span>
				<span class='text'>Chatterjee's statement that &quot;Larkin is no longer just a name but an institution, a modern British national cultural monument&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Chatterjee 2007, p</span>
				<span class='text'>4</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Chatterjee's view of Larkin is grounded in a detailed analysis of his poetic style</span>
				<span class='text'>He notes a development from Larkin's early works to his later ones, which sees his style change from &quot;verbal opulence through a recognition of the self-ironising and self-negating potentiality of language to a linguistic domain where the conventionally held conceptual incompatibles – which are traditional binary oppositions between absolutes and relatives, between abstracts and concretes, between fallings and risings and between singleness and multiplicity – are found to be the last stumbling-block for an artist aspiring to rise above the impasse of worldliness&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Chatterjee 2007, p</span>
				<span class='text'>331</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This contrasts with an older view that Larkin's style barely changed over the course of his poetic career</span>
				<span class='text'>Chatterjee identifies this view as being typified by [[Bernard Bergonzi]]'s comment that &quot;Larkin's poetry did not </span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Chatterjee 2007, p</span>
				<span class='text'>14</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; For Chatterjee, Larkin's poetry responds strongly to changing &quot;economic, socio-political, literary and cultural factors&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Chatterjee 2007, p</span>
				<span class='text'>356</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This positivity, suggests Chatterjee, is most apparent in his later works</span>
				<span class='text'>Over the course of Larkin's poetic career, &quot;The most notable attitudinal development lay in the zone of his view of life, which from being almost irredeemably bleak and pessimistic in ''The North Ship'', became more and more positive with the passage of time&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Chatterjee 2007, p</span>
				<span class='text'>19</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The view that Larkin is not a [[nihilism|nihilist]] or [[pessimist]], but actually displays optimism in his works, is certainly not universally endorsed, but Chatterjee's lengthy study suggests the degree to which old stereotypes of Larkin are now being transcended</span>
				<span class='text'>Representative of these stereotypes is [[Bryan Appleyard]]'s judgement (quoted by Maeve Brennan) that of the writers who &quot;have adopted a personal pose of extreme pessimism and loathing of the world </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>none has done so with quite such a grinding focus on littleness and triviality as Larkin the man&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>109</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ingelbien 2002, p</span>
				<span class='text'>13</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The debate about Larkin is summed up by Matthew Johnson, who observes that in most evaluations of Larkin &quot;one is not really discussing the man, but actually reading a coded and implicit discussion of the supposed values of 'Englishness' that he is held to represent&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Johnson 2007, p</span>
				<span class='text'>66</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Changing attitudes to Englishness are reflected in changing attitudes to Larkin, and the more sustained intellectual interest in the English national character, as embodied in the works of [[Peter Mandler]] for instance, pinpoint one key reason why there is an increased scholarly interest in Larkin</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ingelbien 2002, p</span>
				<span class='text'>196</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;A summative view similar to those of Johnson and Regan is that of Robert Crawford, who argues that &quot;In various ways, Larkin's work depends on, and develops from, Modernism</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Furthermore, he &quot;demonstrates just how slippery the word 'English' is&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Crawford 2000, p</span>
				<span class='text'>276</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Despite these recent developments, Larkin and his circle are nonetheless still firmly rejected by modernist critics and poets</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1990, even before the publication of these two books, Tom Paulin wrote that Larkin's &quot;obscenity is informed by prejudices that are not by any means as ordinary, commonplace, or acceptable as the poetic language in which they are so plainly spelled out</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Paulin 1990</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The letters and Motion's biography fuelled further assessments of this kind, such as [[Lisa Jardine]]'s comment in ''The Guardian'' that &quot;The Britishness of Larkin's poetry carries a baggage of attitudes which the ''Selected Letters'' now make explicit&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;brennan109&quot;/&gt; On the other hand, the revelations were dismissed by the novelist [[Martin Amis]] in ''[[The War Against Cliché]]'', arguing that the letters in particular show nothing more than a tendency for Larkin to tailor his words according to the recipient</span>
				<span class='text'>A similar argument was made by Richard Bradford in his biography on Larkin from 2005</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Trying to resolve Larkin's contradictory opinions on race in his book ''Such Deliberate Disguises: The Art of Philip Larkin'', the writer Richard Palmer quotes a letter Larkin wrote to Betjeman, as if it exposes &quot;all the post-Motion and post-Letters furore about Larkin’s 'racism' as the nonsense it is&quot;:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The American Negro is trying to take a step forward that can be compared only to the ending of slavery in the nineteenth century</span>
				<span class='text'>And despite the dogs, the hosepipes and the burnings, advances have already been made towards giving the Negro his civil rights that would have been inconceivable when Louis Armstrong was a young man</span>
