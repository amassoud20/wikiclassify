				<span class='text'>1&lt;/ref&gt; Gershwin's compositions spanned both popular and classical genres, and his most popular melodies are widely known</span>
				<span class='text'>Among his best-known works are the orchestral compositions ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'' (1924) and ''[[An American in Paris]]'' (1928) as well as the opera ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' (1935)</span>
				<span class='text'>ershwin studied piano under Charles Hambitzer and composition with [[Rubin Goldmark]] and [[Henry Cowell]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He began his career as a [[song plugger]], but soon started composing [[Broadway theatre]] works with his brother [[Ira Gershwin]], and [[Buddy DeSylva]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He moved to [[Paris]] to study with [[Nadia Boulanger]], where he began to compose ''An American in Paris''</span>
				<span class='text'>After returning to [[New York City]], he wrote ''Porgy and Bess'' with Ira and the author [[DuBose Heyward]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Initially a commercial failure, ''Porgy and Bess'' is now considered one of the most important American operas of the twentieth century</span>
				<span class='text'>ershwin moved to Hollywood and composed numerous [[film score]]s until his death in 1937 from a [[brain tumor]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ershwin's compositions have been adapted for use in many films and for television, and several became jazz standards recorded in many variations</span>
				<span class='text'>Many celebrated singers and musicians have covered his songs</span>
				<span class='text'>=Biography=====Early life===Gershwin was born of [[Russian Jews|Russian]] and [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian]] Jewish descent</span>
				<span class='text'>His grandfather, Jakov Gershowitz, had served for 25 years as a mechanic for the [[Imperial Russian Army]] to earn the right of free travel and residence as a Jew</span>
				<span class='text'>He retired near [[Saint Petersburg]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His teenage son, Moishe Gershowitz, worked as a leather cutter for women's shoes</span>
				<span class='text'> Moishe met and fell in love with Roza Bruskina, the teenage daughter of a furrier, born in [[Vilnius]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Bruskina moved with her family to New York due to fears of an increasing anti-Jewish sentiment in Russia; once re-settled, she Americanized her first name to Rose</span>
				<span class='text'> Moishe, faced with compulsory military service in Russia, followed Rose as soon as he had the means to</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon arrival in New York, Moishe Gershowitz used the first name Morris</span>
				<span class='text'> Moishe (Morris) settled at first with a maternal uncle in Brooklyn: a tailor named Greenstein, where he worked as a foreman in a women's shoe factory</span>
				<span class='text'> When Morris and Rose married on July 21, 1895, they were 23 and 19, respectively</span>
				<span class='text'> At some time between 1893 and 1898, Moishe (Morris) Gershowitz changed his surname to Gershwine – even possibly at, or around, the time of his marriage to Roza</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Hyland|2003|pp=1–3}}{{sfn|Pollack|2006|p=3}}{{sfn|Jablonski|1987|pp=29–31}}The first child to the new couple was Ira (given the name 'Israel'), on December 6, 1896</span>
				<span class='text'> It was about that time that Morris moved the family to Brooklyn, to a second-floor dwelling at 242 Snediker Avenue</span>
				<span class='text'>George Gershwin was born at the new residence on September 26, 1898; his birth certificate bears the name Jacob Gershwine, with the surname being commonly pronounced 'Gersh-vin' by the predominantly expatriate Russian and Yiddish community</span>
				<span class='text'>George was named after his late grandfather (the Russian army mechanic)</span>
				<span class='text'>However, although the common American practice was to give children two names&amp;mdash;a first and a middle name&amp;mdash;he had no other name but 'George'</span>
				<span class='text'>Years later, George changed the spelling of his surname to 'Gershwin' after he became a professional musician; subsequently, other members of his family followed suit</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Jablonski|1987|pp=10, 29–31}}George and Ira lived in many different residences, as their father changed dwellings with each new enterprise, with which he became involved</span>
				<span class='text'>Mostly, the boys grew up around the [[Yiddish Theater District]]</span>
				<span class='text'>They frequented the local Yiddish theaters, with George occasionally appearing onstage as an [[Extra (actor)|extra]]</span>

				<span class='text'>eorge lived a usual childhood existence for children of New York tenements - running around with his boyhood friends, roller skating and misbehaving in the streets</span>
				<span class='text'> Remarkably, he cared nothing for music until the age of ten, when he was intrigued by what he heard at his friend Maxie Rosenzweig's violin recital</span>

				<span class='text'> His parents had bought a piano for lessons for his older brother [[Ira Gershwin|Ira]], but to his parents' surprise, and Ira's relief, it was George who spent more time playing it</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Hyland|2003|p=13}} Although his younger sister [[Frances Gershwin]] was the first in the family to make a living through her musical talents, she married young and devoted herself to being a mother and housewife - thus surrendering any serious time to musical endeavors</span>
				<span class='text'>Frances, having given up her performing career, did however settle upon another art: painting, as a creative outlet</span>
				<span class='text'> Painting had also been a hobby George briefly pursued</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Arthur Gershwin]] followed in the paths of George and Ira, when he also became a composer of songs, musicals, and short piano works</span>
				<span class='text'>ith a degree of frustration, George tried various piano teachers for some two years, before finally being introduced to Charles Hambitzer by Jack Miller, the pianist in the Beethoven Symphony Orchestra</span>
				<span class='text'>Until his death in 1918, Hambitzer remained Gershwin's musical mentor and taught him conventional piano technique, introduced him to music of the European classical tradition, and encouraged him to attend orchestral concerts</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Hyland|2003|p=14}} At home, following such concerts, young Gershwin would essentially try to play, at the piano, the music that he had heard - completely from recall, and without sheet music</span>
				<span class='text'>As a matter of course, Gershwin later studied with the classical composer [[Rubin Goldmark]] and avant-garde composer-theorist [[Henry Cowell]], thus formalizing his classical music training</span>

				<span class='text'>He produced dozens, if not hundreds, of rolls under his own and assumed names (pseudonyms attributed to Gershwin include Fred Murtha and Bert Wynn)</span>
				<span class='text'>He also recorded rolls of his own compositions for the Duo-Art and [[Welte-Mignon]] [[reproducing piano]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>As well as recording piano rolls, Gershwin made a brief foray into [[vaudeville]], accompanying both [[Nora Bayes]] and [[Louise Dresser]] on the piano</span>

				<span class='text'>The two collaborated on the Broadway musicals ''Piccadilly to Broadway'' (1920) and ''For Goodness' Sake'' (1922), and jointly composed the score for ''Our Nell'' (1923)</span>
				<span class='text'>This was the beginning of a long friendship; Daly was a frequent arranger, orchestrator and conductor of Gershwin's music, and Gershwin periodically turned to him for musical advice</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Pollack|2006|pp=191–192}}In the early 1920s, Gershwin frequently worked with the lyricist [[Buddy DeSylva]]</span>

				<span class='text'>1935</span>
				<span class='text'>]In 1924, Gershwin composed his first major classical work, ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'', for orchestra and piano</span>
				<span class='text'>This piece featured an intermediate work that would win over the audience when played</span>
				<span class='text'>It was orchestrated by [[Ferde Grofé]] and premiered by [[Paul Whiteman]]'s concert band in New York</span>
				<span class='text'>It proved to be his most popular work</span>
				<span class='text'>n the mid-1920s, Gershwin stayed in Paris for a short period of time, during which he applied to study composition with the noted [[Nadia Boulanger]], who, along with several other prospective tutors such as [[Maurice Ravel]], rejected him</span>
				<span class='text'>They were afraid that rigorous classical study would ruin his [[jazz]]-influenced style</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Jablonski|1987|pp=155–170}} Maurice Ravel's rejection letter to Gershwin told him, &quot;Why become a second-rate Ravel when you're already a first-rate Gershwin?&quot; While there, Gershwin wrote ''[[An American in Paris]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>This work received mixed reviews upon its first performance at [[Carnegie Hall]] on December 13, 1928, but it quickly became part of the standard repertoire in Europe and the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Jablonski|1987|pp=178–180}} Growing tired of the Parisian musical scene, Gershwin returned to the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1929, Gershwin was contracted by [[Fox Film Corporation]] to compose the score for the movie ''[[Delicious (film)|Delicious]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Only two pieces were used in the final film, the five-minute &quot;Dream Sequence&quot; and the six-minute &quot;Manhattan Rhapsody,&quot; which in expanded form was later published as the ''[[Second Rhapsody]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Gershwin became infuriated when the rest of the score was rejected by [[Fox Film Corporation]], and it would be seven years before he worked in Hollywood again</span>
				<span class='text'>==Opera===Gershwin's first opera, [[Blue Monday (opera)|''Blue Monday'']], is a short one-act opera which was not a financial success and has only received limited performances</span>
				<span class='text'>Gershwin's most ambitious composition was ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' (1935)</span>
				<span class='text'>Gershwin called it a &quot;folk opera&quot;, and it is now widely regarded as one of the most important American operas of the twentieth century</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;From the very beginning, it was considered another American classic by the composer of 'Rhapsody in Blue'—even if critics couldn't quite figure out how to evaluate it</span>
				<span class='text'>Was it opera, or was it simply an ambitious Broadway musical? 'It crossed the barriers,' says theater historian Robert Kimball</span>
				<span class='text'>'It wasn't a musical work per se, and it wasn't a drama per se – it elicited response from both music and drama critics</span>
				<span class='text'>But the work has sort of always been outside category</span>

				<span class='text'>rg, October 10, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;Based on the novel ''[[Porgy (novel)|Porgy]]'' by [[DuBose Heyward]], the action takes place in the fictional, colored neighborhood of Catfish Row, [[Charleston, South Carolina]]</span>
				<span class='text'>With the exception of several minor speaking roles, all of the characters are African-American</span>
				<span class='text'>The music combines elements of popular music of the day, with a strong influence of African-American music, of the period, with techniques typical of opera, such as [[recitative]], [[through-composition]] and an extensive system of [[leitmotif]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>''Porgy and Bess'' contains some of Gershwin's most sophisticated music, including a [[fugue]], a [[passacaglia]], the use of [[atonality]], [[polytonality]] and [[polyrhythm]], and a [[tone row]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Even the &quot;set numbers&quot; (of which &quot;[[Summertime (song)|Summertime]]&quot;, &quot;I Got Plenty o' Nuttin'&quot; and &quot;[[It Ain't Necessarily So]]&quot; are well known examples) are some of the most refined and ingenious of Gershwin's compositions</span>
				<span class='text'>For the performances, Gershwin collaborated with [[Eva Jessye]], whom he picked as the musical director</span>
				<span class='text'>One of the outstanding musical alumnae of [[Western University (Kansas)|Western University]] in [[Kansas]], she had created her own choir in New York and performed widely with them</span>
				<span class='text'>The work was first performed in 1935; it was a box office failure in the middle of the [[Great Depression]]</span>
				<span class='text'> The musical has since been recognized as one of the greatest musical and theatrical compositions of the 20th Century</span>
				<span class='text'>==Last years===After the commercial failure of ''Porgy and Bess'', Gershwin moved to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]], California</span>
				<span class='text'>He was commissioned by [[RKO Pictures]] in 1936 to write the music for the film ''[[Shall We Dance (1937 film)|Shall We Dance]]'', starring [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Ginger Rogers]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Gershwin's extended score, which would marry ballet with [[jazz]] in a new way, runs over an hour in length</span>
				<span class='text'>It took Gershwin several months to compose and orchestrate</span>
				<span class='text'>ershwin had a ten-year affair with composer [[Kay Swift]], whom he frequently consulted about his music</span>
				<span class='text'>The two never married, although she eventually divorced her husband [[James Warburg]] in order to commit to the relationship</span>
				<span class='text'>Swift's granddaughter, Katharine Weber, has suggested that the pair were not married because George's mother Rose was &quot;unhappy that Kay Swift wasn't Jewish&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Illness and death===Early in 1937, Gershwin began to complain of blinding headaches and a recurring impression that he smelled burning rubber</span>
				<span class='text'>On February 11, 1937, Gershwin performed his Piano Concerto in F in a special concert of his music with the [[San Francisco Symphony|San Francisco Symphony Orchestra]] under the direction of French maestro [[Pierre Monteux]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Pollack|2006|p=353}} Gershwin, normally a superb pianist in his own compositions, suffered coordination problems and blackouts during the performance</span>
				<span class='text'>He was at the time living with his brother Ira, and Ira's wife Leonore in a rented house in [[Beverly Hills]] while they worked on other Hollywood film projects</span>
				<span class='text'>Leonore Gershwin began to be disturbed by George's mood swings and his seeming inability to eat without spilling food at the dinner table</span>
				<span class='text'>She suspected the onset of mental illness and she insisted he be moved out of their house to lyricist [[Yip Harburg]]'s empty quarters nearby, where he was placed in the care of his valet, Paul Mueller</span>
				<span class='text'>The headaches and olfactory hallucinations continued and on June 23, after an incident in which Gershwin tried to push Mueller out of the car in which they were riding, Gershwin was admitted to [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center|Cedars of Lebanon Hospital]] in Los Angeles for observation</span>
				<span class='text'>Tests showed no physical cause and he was released on the 26th with a diagnosis of &quot;likely hysteria</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; His troubles with coordination and mental acuity worsened, and on the night of July 9 Gershwin collapsed in Harburg's house, where he had been working on the score of ''[[The Goldwyn Follies]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>From left: [[Oskar Fried]]; [[Éva Gauthier]]; Ravel at piano; [[Manoah Leide-Tedesco]]; and George Gershwin</span>
				<span class='text'>]Gershwin was influenced by French composers of the early twentieth century</span>
				<span class='text'>In turn [[Maurice Ravel]] was impressed with Gershwin's abilities, commenting, &quot;Personally I find jazz most interesting: the rhythms, the way the melodies are handled, the melodies themselves</span>
				<span class='text'>I have heard of George Gershwin's works and I find them intriguing</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Mawer|Cross|2000|p=42}} The [[orchestration]]s in Gershwin's symphonic works often seem similar to those of Ravel; likewise, Ravel's two piano concertos evince an influence of Gershwin</span>
				<span class='text'>ershwin asked to study with Ravel</span>
				<span class='text'>When Ravel heard how much Gershwin earned, Ravel replied with words to the effect of, &quot;You should give ''me'' lessons</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; (Some versions of this story feature [[Igor Stravinsky]] rather than Ravel as the composer; however Stravinsky confirmed that he originally heard the story from Ravel</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Rubinstein, ''My Many Years''; Merle Armitage, ''George Gershwin''; Igor Stravinsky and Robert Craft, ''Dialogues and a Diary'', all quoted in Norman Lebrecht, ''The Book of Musical Anecdotes''&lt;/ref&gt;Gershwin's own ''[[Concerto in F (Gershwin)|Concerto in F]]'' was criticized for being related to the work of [[Claude Debussy]], more so than to the expected jazz style</span>
				<span class='text'>The comparison did not deter Gershwin from continuing to explore French styles</span>
				<span class='text'>The title of ''[[An American in Paris]]'' reflects the very journey that he had consciously taken as a composer: &quot;The opening part will be developed in typical French style, in the manner of Debussy and ''[[Les Six]]'', though the tunes are original</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Hyland|2003|p=126}}Aside from the French influence, Gershwin was intrigued by the works of [[Alban Berg]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Darius Milhaud]], and [[Arnold Schoenberg]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also asked Schoenberg for composition lessons</span>
				<span class='text'>Schoenberg refused, saying &quot;I would only make you a bad Schoenberg, and you're such a good Gershwin already</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Norman Lebrecht, ''The Book of Musical Anecdotes''&lt;/ref&gt; (This quote is similar to one credited to [[Maurice Ravel]] during Gershwin's 1928 visit to France – &quot;Why be a second-rate Ravel, when you are a first-rate Gershwin?&quot;)Russian [[Joseph Schillinger]]'s influence as Gershwin's teacher of composition (1932–1936) was substantial in providing him with a method of composition</span>
				<span class='text'>There has been some disagreement about the nature of Schillinger's influence on Gershwin</span>
				<span class='text'>After the posthumous success of ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'', Schillinger claimed he had a large and direct influence in overseeing the creation of the opera; Ira completely denied that his brother had any such assistance for this work</span>
				<span class='text'>A third account of Gershwin's musical relationship with his teacher was written by Gershwin's close friend [[Vernon Duke]], also a Schillinger student, in an article for ''[[the Musical Quarterly]]'' in 1947</span>

				<span class='text'>02}}&lt;/ref&gt;What set Gershwin apart was his ability to manipulate forms of music into his own unique voice</span>
				<span class='text'>He took the jazz he discovered on [[Tin Pan Alley]] into the mainstream by splicing its rhythms and tonality with that of the popular songs of his era</span>
				<span class='text'>Although George Gershwin would seldom make grand statements about his music, he believed that &quot;true music must reflect the thought and aspirations of the people and time</span>

				<span class='text'>rg/previews/paulsimon/ &quot;Paul Simon: The Library Of Congress Gershwin Prize For Popular Song&quot;], PBS article&lt;/ref&gt;==Recordings and film==Early in his career Gershwin recorded more than one hundred and forty [[player piano]] [[piano rolls|rolls]] both under his own name and pseudonyms, which were a main source of income for him</span>
				<span class='text'>The majority were popular music of the period and a smaller proportion were of his own works</span>
				<span class='text'>Once his musical theatre-writing income became substantial, his regular roll-recording career became superfluous</span>
				<span class='text'>He did record additional rolls throughout the 1920s of his main hits for the Aeolian Company's reproducing piano, including a complete version of his ''Rhapsody in Blue''</span>
				<span class='text'>ompared to the piano rolls, there are few accessible audio recordings of Gershwin's playing</span>
				<span class='text'>His first recording was his own ''Swanee'' with the Fred Van Eps Trio in 1919</span>
				<span class='text'>The recorded balance highlights the banjo playing of Van Eps, and the piano is overshadowed</span>
				<span class='text'>The recording took place before ''Swanee'' became famous as an Al Jolson specialty in early 1920</span>
				<span class='text'>ershwin recorded an abridged version of ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'' with [[Paul Whiteman]] and his orchestra for the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] in 1924, soon after the world premiere</span>
				<span class='text'>Gershwin and the same orchestra made an electrical recording of the abridged version for Victor in 1927</span>
				<span class='text'>However, a dispute in the studio over interpretation angered Paul Whiteman and he left</span>
				<span class='text'>The conductor's baton was taken over by Victor's staff conductor [[Nathaniel Shilkret]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Peyser|2007|p=133}}Gershwin made a number of solo piano recordings of tunes from his musicals, some including the vocals of Fred and Adele Astaire, as well as his ''[[Three Preludes (Gershwin)|Three Preludes]]'' for piano</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1929, Gershwin &quot;supervised&quot; the world premiere recording of ''An American in Paris'' with Nathaniel Shilkret and the Victor Symphony Orchestra</span>
				<span class='text'>Gershwin's role in the recording was rather limited, particularly because Shilkret was conducting and had his own ideas about the music</span>
				<span class='text'>When it was realized that no one had been hired to play the brief [[celesta|celeste]] solo, Gershwin was asked if he could and would play the instrument, and he agreed</span>
				<span class='text'>Gershwin can be heard, rather briefly, on the recording during the slow section</span>
				<span class='text'>ershwin appeared on several radio programs, including [[Rudy Vallee]]'s, and played some of his compositions</span>
				<span class='text'>This included the third movement of the ''Concerto in F'' with Vallee conducting the studio orchestra</span>
				<span class='text'>Some of these performances were preserved on [[transcription disc]]s and have been released on LP and CD</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1934, in an effort to earn money to finance his planned folk opera, Gershwin hosted his own radio program titled ''Music by Gershwin''</span>
				<span class='text'>The show was broadcast on the [[NBC Blue Network]] from February to May and again in September through the final show on December 23, 1934</span>
				<span class='text'>He presented his own work as well as the work of other composers</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Pollack|2006|p=163}} Recordings from this and other radio broadcasts include his ''Variations on I Got Rhythm'', portions of the ''Concerto in F'', and numerous songs from his musical comedies</span>
				<span class='text'>He also recorded a run-through of his ''Second Rhapsody'', conducting the orchestra and playing the piano solos</span>
				<span class='text'>Gershwin recorded excerpts from ''Porgy and Bess'' with members of the original cast, conducting the orchestra from the keyboard; he even announced the selections and the names of the performers</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1935 [[RCA Victor]] asked him to supervise recordings of highlights from ''Porgy and Bess''; these were his last recordings</span>
				<span class='text'> 74-second newsreel film clip of Gershwin playing ''I Got Rhythm'' has survived, filmed at the opening of the Manhattan Theater (now The [[Ed Sullivan Theater]]) in August 1931</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Jablonski|Stewart|1973|p=70}} There are also silent home movies of Gershwin, some of them shot on [[Kodachrome]] color film stock, which have been featured in tributes to the composer</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, there is newsreel footage of Gershwin playing &quot;Mademoiselle from New Rochelle&quot; and &quot;[[Strike Up the Band (song)|Strike Up the Band]]&quot; on the piano during a Broadway rehearsal of the 1930 production of ''Strike Up the Band''</span>
				<span class='text'>In the mid-30s, &quot;Strike Up The Band&quot; was given to UCLA to be used as a football fight song, &quot;Strike Up The Band for UCLA&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The comedy team of [[Clark and McCullough]] are seen conversing with Gershwin, then singing as he plays</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1945, the film biography [[Rhapsody in Blue (film)|Rhapsody in Blue]] was made, starring [[Robert Alda]] as George Gershwin</span>
				<span class='text'>The film contains many factual errors about Gershwin's life, but also features many examples of his music, including an almost complete performance of &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1965, [[Movietone Records]] released an album MTM 1009 featuring Gershwin's piano rolls of the titled ''George Gerswhin plays RHAPSODY IN BLUE and his other favorite compositions''</span>
				<span class='text'>The B-side of the LP featured nine other recordings</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1975, [[Columbia Records]] released an album featuring Gershwin's piano rolls of ''Rhapsody In Blue'', accompanied by the Columbia Jazz Band playing the original jazz band accompaniment, conducted by [[Michael Tilson Thomas]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The B-side of the [[Columbia Masterworks]] release features Tilson Thomas leading the [[New York Philharmonic]] in ''An American In Paris</span>
				<span class='text'>'In 1976, RCA Records, as part of their &quot;Victrola Americana&quot; line, released a collection of Gershwin recordings taken from 78s recorded in the 1920s and called the LP &quot;Gershwin plays Gershwin, Historic First Recordings&quot; (RCA Victrola AVM1-1740)</span>
				<span class='text'> Included were recordings of &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; with the Paul Whiteman Orchestra and Gershwin on piano, &quot;An American in Paris&quot;, from 1927 with Gershwin on celesta and &quot;Three Preludes&quot;, &quot;Clap Yo' Hands&quot; and Someone to Watch Over Me&quot;, among others</span>
				<span class='text'>There are a total of ten recordings on the album</span>
				<span class='text'>At the opening ceremony of the 1984 [[Olympic Games]] in Los Angeles, &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; was performed in spectacular fashion by many pianists</span>
				<span class='text'>he soundtrack to [[Woody Allen]]'s 1979 film [[Manhattan (film)|''Manhattan'']] is composed entirely of Gershwin's compositions, including &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;, &quot;[[Love is Sweeping the Country]]&quot;, and [[But Not for Me (song)|&quot;But Not for Me&quot;]], performed by both the New York Philharmonic under [[Zubin Mehta]] and the Buffalo Philharmonic under Michael Tilson Thomas</span>
