				<span class='text'>As a leader of the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] during this time, he became a driving force for the [[Progressive Era]] in the United States in the early 20th century</span>
				<span class='text'>orn a sickly child with debilitating [[asthma]], Roosevelt successfully overcame his health problems by embracing a strenuous lifestyle</span>
				<span class='text'>He integrated his exuberant personality, vast range of interests, and world-famous achievements into a &quot;cowboy&quot; persona defined by robust [[masculinity]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Home-schooled, he became a lifelong naturalist before attending [[Harvard College]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His first of many books, ''[[The Naval War of 1812]]'' (1882), established his reputation as both a learned historian and as a popular writer</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon entering politics, he became the leader of the reform faction of Republicans in New York's state legislature</span>
				<span class='text'>Following the deaths of his wife and mother, he took time to grieve by escaping to the wilderness of the [[American West]] and operating a cattle ranch in the Dakotas for a time, before returning East to run unsuccessfully for Mayor of New York City in 1886</span>
				<span class='text'>He served as [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]] under William McKinley, resigning after one year to serve with the [[Rough Riders]], where he gained national fame for courage during the [[Spanish–American War|War in Cuba]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Returning a war hero, he was elected governor of New York in 1898</span>
				<span class='text'>The state party leadership distrusted him, so they took the lead in moving him to the prestigious, but considered by them powerless, position of running for vice president as McKinley's running mate in the [[United States presidential election, 1900|election of 1900]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Roosevelt campaigned vigorously across the country, helping McKinley win re-election by a landslide on a platform of peace, prosperity, and conservatism</span>
				<span class='text'>ollowing the [[Assassination of William McKinley|assassination of President McKinley]] in September 1901, Roosevelt, at age 42, became the youngest United States President in history</span>
				<span class='text'>Leading his party and country into the [[Progressive Era]], he championed his &quot;[[Square Deal]]&quot; domestic policies, promising the average citizen fairness, breaking of trusts, regulation of railroads, and pure food and drugs</span>
				<span class='text'>Making conservation a top priority, he established myriad new [[National Park Service|national parks, forests, and monuments]] intended to preserve the nation's natural resources</span>
				<span class='text'>In foreign policy, he [[Roosevelt Corollary|focused on Central America]], where he began construction of the [[Panama Canal]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He greatly expanded the United States Navy, and sent the [[Great White Fleet]] on a world tour to project the United States' naval power around the globe</span>
				<span class='text'>His successful efforts to end the [[Russo-Japanese War]] won him the 1906 Nobel Peace Prize</span>
				<span class='text'>[United States presidential election, 1904|Elected in 1904]] to a full term, he continued his pursuit of progressive policies, but many of his efforts and much of his legislative agenda were eventually blocked in Congress</span>
				<span class='text'>Roosevelt successfully groomed his close friend, [[William Howard Taft]], to succeed him in the presidency, and after leaving office, went on safari in Africa and toured Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>Returning to the USA, he became frustrated with Taft's approach as his successor, trying but failing to win [[1912 Republican National Convention|the presidential nomination]] again himself in 1912</span>
				<span class='text'>He then founded his own party, the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive, so-called &quot;Bull Moose&quot; Party]], and called for wide-ranging progressive reforms</span>
				<span class='text'>The split allowed the Democrats to win both the White House and a majority in the Congress in [[United States presidential election, 1912|1912]], and Republicans aligned with Taft would control the Republican Party for decades</span>
				<span class='text'>rustrated at home, Roosevelt led a [[Roosevelt–Rondon Scientific Expedition|two-year expedition in the Amazon]], nearly dying of tropical disease</span>
				<span class='text'>During [[World War I]], he opposed [[Woodrow Wilson|President Wilson]] for keeping the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>out of the war against Germany, and offered his military services, which were never summoned</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he planned to run again for president in 1920, his health quickly deteriorated, and he died in early 1919</span>

				<span class='text'>In deference to Hanna's conservative loyalists, Roosevelt at first offered the party chairmanship to [[Cornelius Bliss]], but he declined</span>
				<span class='text'>Roosevelt then turned to his own man, [[George B</span>
				<span class='text'>Cortelyou]] of New York, the first Secretary of Commerce and Labor</span>
				<span class='text'>To buttress his hold on the party's nomination, Roosevelt made it clear that anyone opposing Cortelyou would be considered to be opposing the President</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>presidential election, 1908|1908]], Roosevelt declared Taft to be a &quot;genuine progressive&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>In January of that year, Roosevelt wrote the following to Taft: &quot;Dear Will: Do you want any action about those federal officials? I will break their necks with the utmost cheerfulness if you say the word!&quot; Just weeks later he branded as &quot;false and malicious&quot;; the charge was that he was using the offices at his disposal to favor Taft</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Brands | 1997 | p = 626}}Taft easily defeated three-time candidate William Jennings Bryan</span>
				<span class='text'>Taft promoted a different progressivism, one that stressed the rule of law and preferred that judges rather than administrators or politicians make the basic decisions about fairness</span>
				<span class='text'>Taft usually proved to be a less adroit politician than Roosevelt and lacked the energy and personal magnetism, along with the publicity devices, the dedicated supporters, and the broad base of public support that made Roosevelt so formidable</span>
				<span class='text'>When Roosevelt realized that lowering the tariff would risk creating severe tensions inside the Republican Party by pitting producers (manufacturers and farmers) against merchants and consumers, he stopped talking about the issue</span>
				<span class='text'>Taft ignored the risks and tackled the tariff boldly, encouraging reformers to fight for lower rates, and then cutting deals with conservative leaders that kept overall rates high</span>
				<span class='text'>The resulting [[Payne-Aldrich tariff]] of 1909 was too high for most reformers, but instead of blaming this on Senator [[Nelson W</span>
				<span class='text'>Aldrich|Nelson Wilmarth Aldrich]] and big businesses, Taft took credit, calling it the best tariff ever</span>
				<span class='text'>He again had managed to alienate all sides</span>
				<span class='text'>While the crisis was building inside the Party, Roosevelt was touring Africa and Europe, to allow Taft to be his own man</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|175px|''Punch'' depicts GOP Schism between Taft and TR]]Roosevelt had attempted to refashion Taft into a younger version of himself, but as soon as Taft began to display his individuality, Roosevelt unveiled his disenchantment</span>
				<span class='text'>He was even offended on election night when Taft wrote and indicated that his success had been possible not just through the efforts of Roosevelt, but also his brother Charley</span>
				<span class='text'>Roosevelt was further alienated when Taft, again intent on becoming his own man, did not consult him about cabinet appointments</span>
				<span class='text'>Lodge empathized with Roosevelt, and therefore declined an offer to become Secretary of State</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Brands | 1997 | pp = 665–66}}Unlike Roosevelt, Taft never attacked business or businessmen in his rhetoric</span>
				<span class='text'>However, he was attentive to the law, so he launched 90 antitrust suits, including one against the largest corporation, US Steel, for an acquisition that Roosevelt had personally approved</span>
				<span class='text'>Consequently, Taft lost the support of antitrust reformers (who disliked his conservative rhetoric), of big business (which disliked his actions), and of Roosevelt, who felt humiliated by his protégé</span>
				<span class='text'>More trouble came when Taft fired Roosevelt's friend and appointee [[Gifford Pinchot]], a leading conservationist</span>
				<span class='text'>Pinchot alleged that Taft's Secretary of the Interior, [[Richard Ballinger]], was in league with big timber interests</span>
				<span class='text'>Conservationists sided with Pinchot, and Taft alienated yet another vocal constituency</span>
				<span class='text'>The left wing of the Republican Party began turning against Taft</span>
				<span class='text'>Senator [[Robert M</span>
				<span class='text'>La Follette Sr</span>
				<span class='text'>] of Wisconsin joined with Pinchot, William White and Hiram Johnson to create the National Progressive Republican League; their objectives were to defeat the power of political bossism at the state level and to replace Taft at the national level</span>
				<span class='text'>Roosevelt declined to join this group—he was still reluctant to leave the GOP</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Brands | 1997 | p = 683}} Roosevelt, back from Europe, unexpectedly launched an attack on the courts</span>
				<span class='text'>He gave his famous speech at Osawatomie, Kansas, in August 1910, which was the most radical of his career and openly initiated his break with the Taft administration and the conservative Republicans</span>
				<span class='text'>Osawatomie was well known as the base used by [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] when he launched his bloody attacks on slavery</span>
				<span class='text'>Advocating a program of &quot;New Nationalism&quot;, Roosevelt emphasized the priority of labor over capital interests, a need to more effectively control corporate creation and combination, and proposed a ban on corporate political contributions</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Brands | 1997 | p = 675}}Roosevelt shortly thereafter made it clear in a meeting with [[Lloyd Carpenter Griscom]], a New York Republican regular, that Taft no longer enjoyed his support, since he had &quot;deliberately abandoned&quot; their previous close relations</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Brands | 1997 | p = 677}} Taft was deeply upset</span>
				<span class='text'>In the 1910 Congressional elections, Democrats won a majority in the House, and significantly diminished the Republican's hold on the Senate; Taft's reelection in 1912 was doubtful</span>
				<span class='text'>The Republican progressives interpreted the defeat as compelling argument for the complete reorganization of the party in 1911, and Roosevelt reacted with renewed interest in more personal political endeavors</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Brands | 1997 | p = 683}} Despite skepticism of La Follette's new League, Roosevelt expressed general support for progressive principles; in fact, between January and April 1911, Roosevelt wrote a series of articles for ''The Outlook'', defending what he called &quot;the great movement of our day, the progressive nationalist movement against special privilege, and in favor of an honest and efficient political and industrial democracy&quot;</span>
