				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|In the [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] version of the Midas myth, Midas's daughter turns to a statue when he touches her</span>
				<span class='text'>Illustration by [[Walter Crane]] for the 1893 edition</span>
				<span class='text'>]'''Midas''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|aɪ|d|ə|s}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Μίδας}}) is the name of at least three members of the royal house of [[Phrygia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>he most famous '''King Midas''' is popularly remembered in [[Greek mythology]] for his ability to turn everything he touched into [[gold]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This came to be called the ''golden touch'', or the ''Midas touch''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;In [[alchemy]], the transmutation of an object into gold is known as ''[[chrysopoeia]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The Phrygian city [[Midaeum]] was presumably named after this Midas, and this is probably also the Midas that according to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] founded [[Ancyra]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] 1</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Aristotle]], legend held that Midas died of starvation as a result of his &quot;vain prayer&quot; for the gold touch</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, Politics, 1</span>
				<span class='text'>257b</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The legends told about this Midas and his father [[Gordias]], credited with founding the Phrygian capital city [[Gordium]] and tying the [[Gordian Knot]], indicate that they were believed to have lived sometime in the 2nd millennium BC, well before the [[Trojan War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>However, [[Homer]] does not mention Midas or [[Gordias]], while instead mentioning two other Phrygian kings, [[Mygdon of Phrygia|Mygdon]] and [[Otreus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>nother King Midas ruled Phrygia in the late 8th century BC, up until the sacking of Gordium by the [[Cimmerians]], when he is said to have committed suicide</span>
				<span class='text'>Most historians believe this Midas is the same person as the ''Mita'', called king of the [[Mushki]] in Assyrian texts, who warred with [[Assyria]] and its [[Ancient Anatolians|Anatolian]] provinces during the same period</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See for example Encyclopedia Britannica; also: &quot;Virtually the only figure in [[Phrygia]]n history who can be recognized as a distinct individual&quot;, begins Lynn E</span>
				<span class='text'>Roller, &quot;The Legend of Midas&quot;, ''Classical Antiquity,'' '''2'''2 (October 1983):299-313</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;A third Midas is said by [[Herodotus]] to have been a member of the royal house of Phrygia and the grandfather of an [[Adrastus]] who fled Phrygia after accidentally killing his brother and took asylum in [[Lydia]] during the reign of [[Croesus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Phrygia was by that time a Lydian subject</span>
				<span class='text'>Herodotus says that Croesus regarded the Phrygian royal house as &quot;friends&quot; but does not mention whether the Phrygian royal house still ruled as (vassal) kings of Phrygia</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Herodotus I</span>
				<span class='text'>5</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Legends==There are many, and often contradictory, legends about the most ancient King Midas</span>
				<span class='text'>In one, Midas was king of [[Pessinus]], a city of [[Phrygia]], who as a child was adopted by King [[Gordias]] and [[Cybele]], the [[goddess]] whose consort he was, and who (by some accounts) was the goddess-mother of Midas himself</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;&quot;King Midas, a Phrygian, son of Cybele&quot; ([[Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 274)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Some accounts place the youth of Midas in [[Macedon]]ian Bermion (See [[Bryges]])&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Bromium&quot; in Graves 1960:83</span>
				<span class='text'>; Greek traditions of the migration from Macedon to Anatolia are examined— as purely literary constructions— in Peter Carrington, &quot;The Heroic Age of Phrygia in Ancient Literature and Art&quot; ''Anatolian Studies'' '''27''' (1977:117-126)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In [[Thrace|Thracian]] [[Mygdonia (Europe)|Mygdonia]],&lt;ref&gt;Mygdonia became part of [[Macedon]] in historical times</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; [[Herodotus]] referred to a wild rose garden at the foot of Mount Bermion as &quot;the garden of Midas son of Gordias, where roses grow of themselves, each bearing sixty blossoms and of surpassing fragrance&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''Histories'' 8</span>
				<span class='text'>38</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus says elsewhere that Phrygians anciently lived in Europe where they were known as [[Bryges]],&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus 7</span>
				<span class='text'>3&lt;/ref&gt; and the existence of the garden implies that Herodotus believed that Midas lived prior to a Phrygian migration to Anatolia</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to some accounts, Midas had a son, [[Lityerses]], the demonic reaper of men, but in some variations of the myth he instead had a daughter, Zoë or &quot;life&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>According to other accounts he had a son [[Anchurus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[Arrian]] gives an alternative story of the descent and life of Midas</span>
				<span class='text'>According to him, Midas was the son of Gordios, a poor peasant, and a [[Telmissus|Telmissian]] maiden of the prophetic race</span>
				<span class='text'>When Midas grew up to be a handsome and valiant man, the Phrygians were harassed by civil discord, and consulting the oracle, they were told that a wagon would bring them a king, who would put an end to their discord</span>
				<span class='text'>While they were still deliberating, Midas arrived with his father and mother, and stopped near the assembly, wagon and all</span>
				<span class='text'>They, comparing the oracular response with this occurrence, decided that this was the person whom the god told them the wagon would bring</span>
				<span class='text'>They therefore appointed Midas king and he, putting an end to their discord, dedicated his father’s wagon in the citadel as a thank-offering to Zeus the king</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition to this the following saying was current concerning the wagon, that whosoever could loosen the cord of the yoke of this wagon, was destined to gain the rule of Asia</span>
				<span class='text'>This someone was to be [[Alexander the Great]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Arrian, Alexandri Anabasis, B</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>-6&lt;/ref&gt; In other versions of the legend, it was Midas' father [[Gordias]] who arrived humbly in the cart and made the [[Gordian Knot]]</span>
				<span class='text'>erodotus said that a &quot;Midas son of Gordias&quot; made an offering to the [[Oracle of Delphi]] of a royal throne &quot;from which he made judgments&quot; that were &quot;well worth seeing&quot;, and that this Midas was the only foreigner to make an offering to Delphi before [[Gyges of Lydia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Herodotus I</span>
				<span class='text'>4</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The historical Midas of the 8th century BC and Gyges are believed to have been contemporaries, so it seems most likely that Herodotus believed that the throne was donated by the earlier, legendary King Midas</span>
				<span class='text'>However, some historians believe that this throne was donated by the later, historical King Midas</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See for example Encyclopedia Britannica, notes to Penguin edition of Herodotus</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;== Myths ==One day, as [[Ovid]] relates in ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' XI,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www</span>
				<span class='text'>heoi</span>
				<span class='text'>om/Text/OvidMetamorphoses11</span>
				<span class='text'>tml On-line text at Theoi</span>
				<span class='text'>om]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dionysus]] found that his old schoolmaster and foster father, the [[satyr]] Silenus, was missing</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;This myth appears in a fragment of [[Aristotle]], ''Eudemus'', (fr</span>
				<span class='text'>); [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] was aware that Midas mixed water with wine to capture Silenus (''Description of Greece'' 1</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>); a muddled version is recounted in [[Flavius Philostratus]]' ''Life of Apollonius of Tyana'', vi</span>
				<span class='text'>7: &quot;Midas himself had some of the blood of [[satyr]]s in his veins, as was clear from the shape of his ears; and a satyr once, trespassing on his kinship with Midas, made merry at the expense of his ears, not only singing about them, but piping about them</span>
				<span class='text'>Well, Midas, I understand, had heard from his mother that when a satyr is overcome by wine he falls asleep, and at such times comes to his senses and will make friends with you; so he mixed wine which he had in his palace in a fountain and let the satyr get at it, and the latter drank it up and was overcome&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The old satyr had been drinking wine and wandered away drunk, to be found by some Phrygian [[peasant]]s who carried him to their king, Midas (alternatively, Silenus passed out in Midas' rose garden)</span>
				<span class='text'>Midas recognized him and treated him hospitably, entertaining him for ten days and nights with politeness, while Silenus delighted Midas and his friends with stories and songs</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]], ''Varia Historia'' iii</span>
				<span class='text'>8 relates some of Silenus' accounts (Graves 1960:83</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; On the eleventh day, he brought Silenus back to Dionysus in [[Lydia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Dionysus offered Midas his choice of whatever reward he wished for</span>
				<span class='text'>Midas asked that whatever he might touch should be changed into gold</span>
				<span class='text'>idas rejoiced in his new power, which he hastened to put to the test</span>
				<span class='text'>He touched an oak twig and a stone; both turned to gold</span>
				<span class='text'>Overjoyed, as soon as he got home, he ordered the servants to set a feast on the table</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;So Midas, king of Lydia, swelled at first with pride when he found he could transform everything he touched to gold; but when he beheld his food grow rigid and his drink harden into golden ice then he understood that this gift was a bane and in his loathing for gold, cursed his prayer&quot; ([[Claudian]], ''In Rufinem'')</span>
				<span class='text'>In a version told by [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] in ''[[A Wonder-Book for Girls and Boys]]'' (1852), Midas found that when he touched his daughter, she turned to gold as well</span>
				<span class='text'>Now, Midas hated the gift he had coveted</span>
				<span class='text'>He prayed to Dionysus, begging to be delivered from starvation</span>
				<span class='text'>Dionysus heard his prayer, and consented; telling Midas to wash in the river [[Pactolus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Then, what ever he put into the water would be reversed of the touch</span>
				<span class='text'>idas did so, and when he touched the waters, the power flowed into the river, and the river sands turned into gold</span>
				<span class='text'>This explained why the river Pactolus was so rich in gold, and the wealth of the dynasty claiming Midas as its forefather no doubt the impetus for this [[aetiology|aetiological myth]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Gold was perhaps not the only metallic source of Midas' riches: &quot;King Midas, a Phrygian, son of [[Cybele]], first discovered black and white lead&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]''274&lt;/ref&gt;Midas, now hating wealth and splendor, moved to the country and became a worshipper of [[Pan (god)|Pan]], the god of the fields and satyr</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;This myth puts Midas in another setting</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Midas himself had some of the blood of satyrs in his veins, as was clear from the shape of his ears&quot; was the assertion of [[Flavius Philostratus]], in his ''Life of [[Apollonius of Tyana]]'' (vi</span>
				<span class='text'>7), not always a dependable repository of myth</span>
				<span class='text'>([http://www</span>
				<span class='text'>ivius</span>
				<span class='text'>rg/ap-ark/apollonius/life/va_6_26</span>
				<span class='text'>tml on-line])&lt;/ref&gt; Roman mythographers&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]] ''On Divination''i</span>
				<span class='text'>6; [[Valerius Maximus]], i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>; [[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]], xi</span>
				<span class='text'>2f</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; asserted that his tutor in music was [[Orpheus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>nce, Pan had the audacity to compare his music with that of [[Apollo]] and challenged Apollo, to a trial of skill (also see [[Marsyas]])</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Tmolus]], the mountain-god, was chosen as umpire</span>
				<span class='text'>Pan blew on his pipes and, with his rustic melody, gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower, Midas, who happened to be present</span>
				<span class='text'>Then, Apollo struck the strings of his lyre</span>
				<span class='text'>Tmolus at once awarded the victory to Apollo, and all but one agreed with the judgment</span>
				<span class='text'>Midas dissented, and questioned the justice of the award</span>
				<span class='text'>Apollo would not suffer such a depraved pair of ears any longer, and said,&quot;Must have ears of an ass!&quot; and caused them to become the ears of a [[donkey]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' 191</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The myth is illustrated by two paintings, ''&quot;[[Apollo and Marsyas]]&quot;'' by [[Palma il Giovane]] (1544–1628), one depicting the scene before, and one after, the punishment</span>
				<span class='text'>Midas was mortified at this mishap</span>
				<span class='text'>He attempted to hide his misfortune under an ample turban or headdress, but his [[barber]] of course knew the secret, so was told not to mention it</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the barber could not keep the secret; he went out into the meadow, dug a hole in the ground, whispered the story into it, then covered the hole up</span>
				<span class='text'>A thick bed of reeds later sprang up in the meadow, and began whispering the story, saying &quot;King Midas has an ass' ears&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;The whispering sound of reeds is an ancient [[literary trope]]: the Sumerian ''Instructions of Shuruppak'' (3rd millennium BCE) warn &quot;The reed-beds are </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> they can hide (?) slander&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>([http://etcsl</span>

				<span class='text'>tm ''Instructions of Shuruppak'', lines 92-93])</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Some sources said that Midas killed himself by drinking the blood of an [[ox]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Sarah Morris demonstrated (Morris 2004) that donkeys' ears were a Bronze Age royal attribute, borne by King Tarkasnawa (Greek Tarkondemos) of [[Arzawa|Mira]], on a seal inscribed in both [[Hittite language|Hittite]] cuneiform and [[Luwian]] hieroglyphs: in this connection, the myth would appear for Greeks, to justify the exotic attribute</span>
				<span class='text'>n pre-Islamic legend of Central Asia, the king of the [[Ossounes]] of the [[Yenisei]] basin had [[donkey's ears]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He would hide them, and order each of his barbers murdered to hide his secret</span>
				<span class='text'>The last barber among his people was counselled to whisper the heavy secret into a well after sundown, but he didn't cover the well afterwards</span>
				<span class='text'>The well water rose and flooded the kingdom, creating the waters of [[Lake Issyk-Kul]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;The legend is related in Ella Maillart, Dervla Murphy, ''Turkestan solo: a journey through Central Asia'' (1938) 2005:48f; a wholly separate origin uncontaminated by the legend of Midas is not likely</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;According to an Irish legend, the king [[Labraid Loingsech]] had horse's ears, something he was concerned to keep quiet</span>
				<span class='text'>He had his hair cut once a year, and the barber, who was chosen by lot, was immediately put to death</span>
				<span class='text'>A widow, hearing that her only son had been chosen to cut the king's hair, begged the king not to kill him, and he agreed, so long as the barber kept his secret</span>
				<span class='text'>The burden of the secret was so heavy that the barber fell ill</span>
				<span class='text'>A [[druid]] advised him to go to a crossroads and tell his secret to the first tree he came to, and he would be relieved of his burden and be well again</span>
				<span class='text'>He told the secret to a large [[willow]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon after this, however, a harper named Craiftine broke his instrument, and made a new one out of the very willow the barber had told his secret to</span>
				<span class='text'>Whenever he played it, the harp sang &quot;Labraid Lorc has horse's ears&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Labraid repented of all the barbers he had put to death and admitted his secret</span>

				<span class='text'>According to the former, he married a Greek princess, [[Damodice]] daughter of [[Agamemnon]] of [[Cyme (Aeolis)|Cyme]], [[Aeolis|Aeolia]], and traded extensively with the Greeks</span>
				<span class='text'>Some historians believe this Midas donated the throne that [[Herodotus]] says was offered to the [[Oracle of Delphi]] by &quot;Midas son of Gordias&quot; (see above)</span>
				<span class='text'>Assyrian tablets from the reign of [[Sargon II]] record attacks by a &quot;Mita&quot;, king of the [[Mushki]], against Assyria's eastern Anatolian provinces</span>
				<span class='text'>Some historians believe Assyrian texts called this Midas king of the &quot;Mushki&quot; because he had subjected the eastern Anatolian people of that name and incorporated them into his army</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>1</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; say that Midas committed suicide by drinking bulls' blood during an attack by the Cimmerians, which [[Eusebius]] dated to around 695 BC and [[Julius Africanus]] to around 676 BC</span>
