				<span class='text'>Archimedes had proven that the volume and surface area of the sphere are two thirds that of the cylinder including its bases</span>

				<span class='text'>He had heard stories about the tomb of Archimedes but none of the locals was able to give him the location</span>
				<span class='text'>Eventually he found the tomb near the Agrigentine gate in Syracuse in a neglected condition and overgrown with bushes</span>
				<span class='text'>Cicero had the tomb cleaned up and was able to see the carving and read some of the verses that had been added as an inscription</span>
				<span class='text'> A tomb discovered in the courtyard of the Hotel Panorama in Syracuse in the early 1960s was claimed to be that of Archimedes but there was no compelling evidence for this and the location of his tomb today is unknown</span>
				<span class='text'>The standard versions of the life of Archimedes were written long after his death by the historians of Ancient Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>The account of the siege of Syracuse given by  in his Universal History was written around seventy years after Archimedes death and was used subsequently as a source by Plutarch and </span>
				<span class='text'>It sheds little light on Archimedes as a person and focuses on the war machines that he is said to have built in order to defend the city</span>
				<span class='text'>Discoveries and inventionsThe most widely known  about Archimedes tells of how he invented a method for determining the volume of an object with an irregular shape</span>
				<span class='text'>According to  a  for a temple had been made for King Hiero II who had supplied the pure  to be used and Archimedes was asked to determine whether some  had been substituted by the dishonest goldsmith</span>
				<span class='text'> Archimedes had to solve the problem without damaging the crown so he could not melt it down into a regularly shaped body in order to calculate its </span>
				<span class='text'>hile taking a bath he noticed that the level of the water in the tub rose as he got in and realized that this effect could be used to determine the  of the crown</span>
				<span class='text'>For practical purposes water is incompressible  so the submerged crown would displace an amount of water equal to its own volume</span>
				<span class='text'>By dividing the mass of the crown by the volume of water displaced the density of the crown could be obtained</span>
				<span class='text'>This density would be lower than that of gold if cheaper and less dense metals had been added</span>
				<span class='text'>Archimedes then took to the streets naked so excited by his discovery that he had forgotten to dress crying  heúrēka meaning I have found it</span>
				<span class='text'>The test was conducted successfully proving that silver had indeed been mixed in</span>
				<span class='text'>The story of the golden crown does not appear in the known works of Archimedes</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover the practicality of the method it describes has been called into question due to the extreme accuracy with which one would have to measure the water displacement</span>
				<span class='text'>name inaccuracy  Archimedes may have instead sought a solution that applied the principle known in  as  which he describes in his treatise On Floating Bodies</span>
				<span class='text'>This principle states that a body immersed in a fluid experiences a  equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces</span>
				<span class='text'> Using this principle it would have been possible to compare the density of the golden crown to that of solid gold by balancing the crown on a scale with a gold erence sample then immersing the apparatus in water</span>
				<span class='text'>The difference in density between the two samples would cause the scale to tip accordingly</span>
				<span class='text'> considered it probable that this method is the same that Archimedes followed since besides being very accurate it is based on demonstrations found by Archimedes himself</span>

				<span class='text'>The Greek writer  described how King Hiero II commissioned Archimedes to design a huge ship the  which could be used for luxury travel carrying supplies and as a naval warship</span>
				<span class='text'>The Syracusia is said to have been the largest ship built in classical antiquity</span>
				<span class='text'> According to Athenaeus it was capable of carrying 600 people and included garden decorations a  and a temple dedicated to the goddess  among its facilities</span>

				<span class='text'>When the claw was dropped onto an attacking ship the arm would swing upwards lifting the ship out of the water and possibly sinking it</span>
				<span class='text'>There have been modern experiments to test the feasibility of the claw and in 2005 a television documentary entitled Superweapons of the Ancient World built a version of the claw and concluded that it was a workable device</span>

				<span class='text'> This was once thought to have been beyond the range of the technology available in ancient times but the discovery of the Antikythera mechanism in 1902 has confirmed that devices of this kind were known to the ancient Greeks</span>
				<span class='text'> Mathematics While he is often regarded as a designer of mechanical devices Archimedes also made contributions to the field of mathematics</span>
				<span class='text'> wrote He placed his whole affection and ambition in those purer speculations where there can be no erence to the vulgar needs of life</span>
				<span class='text'>Archimedes was able to use s in a way that is similar to modern </span>
				<span class='text'>Through proof by contradiction  he could give answers to problems to an arbitrary degree of accuracy while specifying the limits within which the answer lay</span>
				<span class='text'>This technique is known as the  and he employed it to approximate the value of π</span>
				<span class='text'>In  he did this by drawing a larger  outside a  and a smaller regular hexagon inside the circle and progressively doubling the number of sides of each regular polygon calculating the length of a side of each polygon at each step</span>
				<span class='text'>As the number of sides increases it becomes a more accurate approximation of a circle</span>
				<span class='text'>After four such steps when the polygons had 96 sides each he was able to determine that the value of π lay between 3 approximately 3</span>
				<span class='text'>429 and 3 approximately 3</span>
				<span class='text'>408 consistent with its actual value of approximately 3</span>
				<span class='text'>416</span>
				<span class='text'> He also proved that the  of a circle was equal to π multiplied by the  of the  of the circle πrsup2 sup</span>

				<span class='text'>The actual value is approximately 1</span>
				<span class='text'>320508 making this a very accurate estimate</span>
				<span class='text'>He introduced this result without offering any explanation of how he had obtained it</span>
				<span class='text'>This aspect of the work of Archimedes caused  to remark that he was as it were of set purpose to have covered up the traces of his investigation as if he had grudged posterity the secret of his method of inquiry while he wished to extort from them assent to his results</span>
