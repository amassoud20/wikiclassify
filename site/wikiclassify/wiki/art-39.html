				<span class='text'>]The foremost document containing the work of Archimedes is the [[Archimedes Palimpsest]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1906, the Danish professor [[Johan Ludvig Heiberg (historian)|Johan Ludvig Heiberg]] visited [[Constantinople]] and examined a 174-page goatskin parchment of prayers written in the 13th century AD</span>
				<span class='text'>He discovered that it was a [[palimpsest]], a document with text that had been written over an erased older work</span>
				<span class='text'>Palimpsests were created by scraping the ink from existing works and reusing them, which was a common practice in the Middle Ages as [[vellum]] was expensive</span>
				<span class='text'>The older works in the palimpsest were identified by scholars as 10th century AD copies of previously unknown treatises by Archimedes</span>
