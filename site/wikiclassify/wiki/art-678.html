				<span class='text'>The first are considered emblematic of the final stage of Austro-German [[Romantic music|Romanticism]] because of their rich harmonic language, strongly [[polyphony|polyphonic]] character, and considerable length</span>

				<span class='text'>nlike other musical radicals such as [[Richard Wagner]] and [[Hugo Wolf]] who fit the ''[[wikt:enfant terrible|enfant terrible]]'' mould, Bruckner showed extreme humility before other musicians, Wagner in particular</span>
				<span class='text'>This apparent dichotomy between Bruckner the man and Bruckner the composer hampers efforts to describe his life in a way that gives a straightforward context for his music</span>

				<span class='text'>The ancestors of Bruckner's family were farmers and craftsmen; their history can be traced to as far back as the 16th century</span>
				<span class='text'>They lived near a bridge south of [[Sindelburg]], which led to their being called &quot;Pruckhner an der Pruckhen&quot; (bridgers on the bridge)</span>
				<span class='text'>Bruckner's grandfather was appointed schoolmaster in Ansfelden in 1776; this position was inherited by Bruckner's father, Anton Bruckner senior, in 1823</span>

				<span class='text'>New York: Grossman Publishers (1970): 8</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Josef Bruckner had twelve children, and one of them, Anton, born in 1791, became a teacher like his father</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>In 1823 he married Therese Helm from Streyr, a marriage which was to be blessed with eleven children, </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Their eldest was Josef Anton, born on 4 September 1824 and named after his grandfather</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Music was a part of the school curriculum, and Bruckner's father was his first music teacher</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=grebe/&gt; Bruckner learned to play the organ early as a child</span>
				<span class='text'>He entered school when he was six, proved to be a hard-working student, and was promoted to upper class early</span>
				<span class='text'>While studying, Bruckner also helped his father in teaching the other children</span>
				<span class='text'>After Bruckner received his [[confirmation]] in 1833, Bruckner's father sent him to another school in [[Hörsching]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The schoolmaster, [[Johann Baptist Weiß (teacher)|Johann Baptist Weiß]], was a music enthusiast and respected organist</span>
				<span class='text'>Here, Bruckner completed his school education and learned to play the organ excellently</span>
				<span class='text'>Around 1835 Bruckner wrote his first composition, a ''[[Pange lingua, WAB 31|Pange lingua]]''&amp;nbsp;– one of the compositions which he revised at the end of his life</span>

				<span class='text'>lorian Monastery</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|[[St Florian's Priory]], where Bruckner lived on many occasions during his life]]Bruckner's father died in 1837, when Bruckner was 13 years old</span>
				<span class='text'>The teacher's position and house were given to a successor, and Bruckner was sent to the [[Augustinian]] [[St</span>
				<span class='text'>Florian Monastery|monastery]] in [[Sankt Florian]] to become a choirboy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=grebe/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Derek Watson, ''Bruckner''</span>
				<span class='text'>New York: Schuster &amp; Macmillan (1997): 3&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to choir practice, his education included violin and organ lessons</span>
				<span class='text'>Bruckner was in awe of the monastery's great organ, which was built during the late baroque era and rebuilt in 1837, and he sometimes played it during church services</span>
				<span class='text'>Later, the organ was to be called the &quot;Bruckner Organ&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite his musical abilities, Bruckner's mother sent her son to a teaching seminar in [[Linz]] in 1841</span>
				<span class='text'>After completing the seminar with an excellent grade, he was sent as a teacher's assistant to a school in [[Windhaag bei Freistadt|Windhaag]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The living standards and pay were horrible, and Bruckner was constantly humiliated by his superior, teacher Franz Fuchs</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite the difficult situation, Bruckner never complained or rebelled; a belief of inferiority was to remain one of Bruckner's main personal characteristics during his whole life</span>
				<span class='text'>He would stay at Windhaag from age 17–19, teaching subjects that did not have to do with music</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Prelate]] Michael Arneth noticed Bruckner's bad situation in Windhaag and awarded him a teacher's assistant position in the vicinity of the monastic town of Sankt Florian, sending him to [[Kronstorf]] an der Enns for two years</span>
				<span class='text'>Here he would be able to have more of a part in musical activity</span>
				<span class='text'>The time in Kronstorf was a much happier one for Bruckner</span>
				<span class='text'>Compared to the few works he wrote in Windhaag, the Kronstorf compositions from 1843–1845 show a significantly improved artistic ability, and finally the beginnings of what could be called &quot;the Bruckner style&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>This has been interpreted as a lone early sign of Bruckner's artistic ambitions</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=handbuch/&gt; In May 1845, Bruckner passed an examination, which allowed him to begin work as an assistant teacher in one of the village schools of Sankt Florian</span>

				<span class='text'>The education, which included skills in music theory and counterpoint among others, took place mostly via correspondence, but also included long in-person sessions in Vienna</span>
				<span class='text'>Sechter's teaching would have a profound influence on Bruckner</span>
				<span class='text'>Later, when Bruckner began teaching music himself, he would base his curriculum on Sechter's book ''Die Grundsätze der musikalischen Komposition'' (Leipzig 1853/54)</span>

				<span class='text'>1&lt;/ref&gt; In 1861, Bruckner studied further with [[Otto Kitzler]], who was nine years younger than him and who introduced him to the music of [[Richard Wagner]], which Bruckner studied extensively from 1863 onwards</span>
				<span class='text'>Bruckner considered the earliest orchestral works (the &quot;study&quot; [[Study Symphony in F minor|Symphony in F minor]], the [[Four Orchestral Pieces (Bruckner)#Three Pieces for orchestra|three orchestral pieces]], the [[Four Orchestral Pieces (Bruckner)#March in D minor|March in D minor]] and the [[Overture (Bruckner)|Overture in G minor]], which he composed in 1862-1863), mere school exercises, done under the supervision of Otto Kitzler</span>
				<span class='text'>He continued his studies to the age of 40</span>
				<span class='text'>Broad fame and acceptance did not come until he was over 60 (after the premiere of his [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>7 (Bruckner)|Seventh Symphony]] in 1884)</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1861 he had already made the acquaintance of [[Franz Liszt]] who, like Bruckner, had a strong, Catholic religious faith and who first and foremost was a harmonic innovator, initiating the new German school together with Wagner</span>
				<span class='text'>In May 1861 he made his concert debut, as both composer and conductor of his ''[[Ave Maria (Bruckner)|Ave Maria]]'', set in seven parts</span>

				<span class='text'>From 1861 to 1868, he alternated his time between Vienna and Sankt Florian</span>

				<span class='text'>1860]]In 1868, after Sechter had died, Bruckner hesitantly accepted Sechter's post as a teacher of [[music theory]] at the [[University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna|Vienna Conservatory]], during which time he concentrated most of his energy on writing symphonies</span>
				<span class='text'>These symphonies, however, were poorly received, at times considered &quot;wild&quot; and &quot;nonsensical&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>&quot;In July 1875 Bruckner </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>proposed yet a third time to the university of Vienna that a lectureship in harmony and counterpoint be created, and at long last, despite Hanslick's opposition, his application was successful</span>
				<span class='text'>Bruckner was appointed to the post, and on 25 November 1875 he gave his opening oration</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; where he tried to make music theory a part of the curriculum</span>
				<span class='text'>Overall, he was unhappy in [[Vienna]], which was musically dominated by the critic [[Eduard Hanslick]]</span>
				<span class='text'>At the time, there was a feud between advocates of the music of Wagner and Brahms; by aligning himself with Wagner, Bruckner made an unintentional enemy out of Hanslick</span>
				<span class='text'>He was not without supporters, though</span>
				<span class='text'>''Deutsche Zeitung'''s music critic [[Theodor Helm]], and famous conductors such as [[Arthur Nikisch]] and [[Franz Schalk]] constantly tried to bring his music to the public, and for this purpose proposed &quot;improvements&quot; for making Bruckner's music more acceptable to the public</span>
				<span class='text'>While Bruckner allowed these changes, he also made sure in his will to bequeath his original scores to the Vienna National Library, confident of their musical validity</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=April 2012}}In addition to his symphonies, Bruckner wrote [[Mass (music)|masses]], [[motet]]s and other sacred [[choir|choral]] works, and a few chamber works, including a [[String Quintet (Bruckner)|string quintet]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Unlike his [[romantic music|romantic]] symphonies, some of Bruckner's choral works are often conservative and [[counterpoint|contrapuntal]] in style; however, the [[Te Deum (Bruckner)|Te Deum]], [[Helgoland (Bruckner)|Helgoland]], [[Psalm 150 (Bruckner)|Psalm 150]] and at least one Mass demonstrate innovative and radical uses of chromaticism</span>
				<span class='text'>iographers generally characterize Bruckner as a &quot;simple&quot; provincial man,&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gammond, ''Bluff Your Way in Music''</span>
				<span class='text'>London: Ravette Books (1985):: 33</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;it is generally said that Bruckner was a very simple man </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>If, after listening to one of his symphonies, you still feel that he was simple, then you are not the kind of person who should be reading this book</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and many biographers have complained that there is huge discrepancy between Bruckner's life and his work</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, Karl Grebe said: &quot;his life doesn't tell anything about his work, and his work doesn't tell anything about his life, that's the uncomfortable fact any biography must start from</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Grebe: Anton Bruckner</span>
				<span class='text'>Rowohlt Taschenbuch Verlag, Hamburg 1972</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Anecdotes abound as to Bruckner's dogged pursuit of his chosen craft and his humble acceptance of the fame that eventually came his way</span>
				<span class='text'>Once, after a rehearsal of his [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>4 (Bruckner)|Fourth Symphony]] in 1881, the well-meaning Bruckner tipped the conductor [[Hans Richter (conductor)|Hans Richter]]: &quot;When the symphony was over,&quot; Richter related, &quot;Bruckner came to me, his face beaming with enthusiasm and joy</span>
				<span class='text'>I felt him press a coin into my hand</span>
				<span class='text'>'Take this' he said, 'and drink a glass of beer to my health</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot; Richter, of course, accepted the coin, a [[Maria Theresa thaler]], and wore it on his watch-chain ever after</span>
				<span class='text'>ruckner was a renowned organist in his day, impressing audiences in France in 1869, and England in 1871, giving six recitals on a new [[Henry Willis]] organ at [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London and five more at [[the Crystal Palace]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Though he wrote no major works for the organ,&lt;ref&gt;Derek Watson, ''Bruckner''</span>
				<span class='text'>New York: Schuster &amp; Macmillan (1997): 73</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Unlike Franck or Reger, however, he [Bruckner] has not left a single composition of any value for his instrument</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt; his improvisation sessions sometimes yielded ideas for the symphonies</span>
				<span class='text'>He taught organ performance at the Conservatory; among his students were [[Hans Rott]] and [[Franz Schmidt]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Gustav Mahler]], who called Bruckner his &quot;forerunner&quot;, attended the conservatory at this time</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;(Walter n</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Bruckner was a lifelong bachelor who made numerous unsuccessful marriage proposals to teenage girls</span>
				<span class='text'>One such was the daughter of a friend, called Louise; in his grief he is believed to have written the cantata &quot;Entsagen&quot; (Renunciation)</span>
				<span class='text'>His affection for teenage girls led to an accusation of impropriety where he taught music, and while he was exonerated, he decided to concentrate on teaching boys afterwards</span>
				<span class='text'>His calendar for 1874 details the names of girls who appealed to him, and the list of such girls in all his diaries was very long</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1880 he fell for a 17-year-old peasant girl in the cast of the [[Oberammergau Passion Play]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His interest in young girls seems to have been motivated by his fear of sin; he believed that (unlike older women) he could be certain that he was marrying a virgin</span>
				<span class='text'>His unsuccessful proposals to teenagers continued when he was past his 70th birthday; one prospect, Berlin hotel chambermaid Ida Buhz, came near to marrying him but broke off the engagement when she refused to convert to Catholicism</span>

				<span class='text'>=== Style ====[[File:Bruckner erhaelt Diplom</span>
				<span class='text'>ng|right|170px|thumb|Bruckner with the [[Order of Franz Joseph]], 1886]]Bruckner's symphonies are scored for a fairly standard orchestra of [[woodwinds]] in pairs, four [[French horn|horn]]s, two or three [[trumpet]]s, three [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]] (from the second version of the [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>4 (Bruckner)|Fourth]]), [[timpani]] and [[String instruments#Symphonic strings|strings]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The later symphonies increase this complement, but not by much</span>
				<span class='text'>Notable is the use of [[Wagner tuba]]s in his last three symphonies</span>
				<span class='text'>Only the [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>8 (Bruckner)|Eighth]] has [[harp]], and percussion besides timpani (though legend has it the [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>7 (Bruckner)|Seventh]] is supposed to have a [[cymbal]] crash at the exact moment Wagner died)</span>
				<span class='text'>Bruckner's style of orchestral writing was criticized by his Viennese contemporaries, but by the middle of the twentieth century, musicologists recognized that his orchestration was modeled after the sound of his primary instrument, the [[pipe organ]], ''i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>', alternating between two groups of instruments, as when changing from one manual of the organ to another</span>
				<span class='text'>=== Structure ====The structure of Bruckner's symphonies is in a way an extension of that of [[Beethoven]]'s symphonies</span>
				<span class='text'>Bruckner's symphonies are in four movements</span>
				<span class='text'> '''The first movement''', in [[Time signature|4/4]] or [[Time signature|2/2]], is, from [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>2 (Bruckner)|Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>2]] on, an [[Allegro (music)|allegro]] in modified [[sonata form]] with three thematic groups</span>
				<span class='text'>The first group is mostly displayed in [[Dynamics (music)#Relative loudness|piano]] or [[Dynamics (music)#Relative loudness|pianissimo]] on a [[tremolo]] of the string instruments and is, after a long [[crescendo]], repeated in [[tutti]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The second group, melodious and in A-B-A’ [[lied]] form, is mostly of [[Contrapuntal motion|contrapuntal structure]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The third group, mostly [[rhythm]]ical and often in [[unison]], is sometimes a variant of the first group, as in [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>4 (Bruckner)|Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>4]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The often extensive [[Musical development|development]] is followed by a modified and somewhat shortened [[reprise]] and a powerful [[Coda (music)|coda]]</span>
				<span class='text'> '''The second movement''', mostly an [[Adagio (music)|adagio]] in 4/4, is generally in ABA’B’A’’ lied form</span>
				<span class='text'>The first thematic group, sometime rhythmical, is developed and magnified in the second and third parts</span>
				<span class='text'>The second group is mostly a [[melody]] in cantilena form</span>
				<span class='text'>The adagio is put in third position in the first version of [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>2 (Bruckner)|Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>2]], and in [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>8 (Bruckner)|Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>8]] and [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>9 (Bruckner)|Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>9]]</span>
				<span class='text'> '''The [[scherzo]]''' in [[Time signature|3/4]] and in [[minor mode]] is often fiery</span>
				<span class='text'>The, sometimes very short, trio is more melodious and often in [[Ländler]] form</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''[[da capo]]'' reprise is, in Bruckner's early symphonies, ending with a short, powerful coda</span>
				<span class='text'>The revised version of the [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>4 (Bruckner)|Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>4]] features a scherzo – the &quot;Hunt scherzo&quot; – in which the outer sections are in 2/4 and in [[major mode]]</span>
				<span class='text'> '''The [[Finale (music)|Finale]]''', in 4/4 or 2/2, is, as the first movement, an allegro in modified sonata form with three thematic groups</span>
				<span class='text'>The first group, often a kind of [[Introduction (music)|introduction]], is followed by a second, melodious and often contrapuntal group, and a third, rhythmical and often in unison, group, which is sometimes a variant of the first group, as in [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>2 (Bruckner)|Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>2]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The development, often of dramatic character, is followed by a less formal reprise, which is sometimes inverted (C’-B’-A’) as in [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>7 (Bruckner)|Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>7]], and a coda in which the first thematic group of the first movement is magnified</span>
				<span class='text'>In the coda of [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>8 (Bruckner)|Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>8]], the first thematic group of all four movements are magnified</span>
				<span class='text'>icholas Temperley writes in the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians (1980)]]'' that Bruckner&lt;blockquote&gt;alone succeeded in creating a new school of symphonic writing</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> Some have classified him as a conservative, some as a radical</span>
				<span class='text'>Really he was neither, or alternatively was a fusion of both</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> [H]is music, though Wagnerian in its orchestration and in its huge rising and falling periods, patently has its roots in older styles</span>
				<span class='text'>Bruckner took [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] as his starting-point</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> The introduction to the first movement, beginning mysteriously and climbing slowly with fragments of the first theme to the gigantic full statement of that theme, was taken over by Bruckner; so was the awe-inspiring coda of the first movement</span>
				<span class='text'>The scherzo and slow movement, with their alternation of melodies, are models for Bruckner's spacious middle movements, while the finale with a grand culminating hymn is a feature of almost every Bruckner symphony</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Temperley, ''New Grove (1980)'', 18:461–462</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Bruckner is the first composer since [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]] about whom it is possible to make such generalizations</span>
				<span class='text'>His symphonies deliberately followed a pattern, each one building on the achievements of its predecessors</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> His melodic and harmonic style changed little, and it had as much of Schubert in it as of Wagner</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> His technique in the [[musical development|development]] and [[thematic transformation|transformation of themes]], learnt from Beethoven, [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]] and Wagner, was unsurpassed, and he was almost the equal of Brahms in the art of melodic variation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Temperley, ''New Grove (1980)'', 18:462</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Cooke adds, also in the ''New Grove'',&lt;blockquote&gt;Despite its general debt to Beethoven and Wagner, the &quot;Bruckner Symphony&quot; is a unique conception, not only because of the individuality of its spirit and its materials, but even more because of the absolute originality of its formal processes</span>
				<span class='text'>At first, these processes seemed so strange and unprecedented that they were taken as evidence of sheer incompetence</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> Now it is recognized that Bruckner's unorthodox structural methods were inevitable</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> Bruckner created a new and monumental type of symphonic organism, which abjured the tense, dynamic continuity of Beethoven, and the broad, fluid continuity of Wagner, in order to express something profoundly different from either composer, something elemental and metaphysical</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cooke, ''New Grove (1980)'', 3:365</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In a concert review, [[Bernard Holland]] described parts of the first movements of Bruckner's sixth and seventh symphonies as follows: &quot;There is the same slow, broad introduction, the drawn-out climaxes that grow, pull back and then grow some more – a sort of musical coitus interruptus</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name = NYT&gt;{{citation | title= In a Show of Accessibility, Schumann Joins Bruckner| last= Holland | first= Bernard | newspaper=New York Times | date= 25 January 2008 | url= http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>tml}}&lt;/ref&gt;In the 2001 Second Edition of the ''New Grove'', Mark Evan Bonds called the Bruckner symphonies &quot;monumental in scope and design, combining lyricism with an inherently polyphonic design</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> Bruckner favored an approach to large-scale form that relied more on large-scale thematic and harmonic juxtaposition</span>
				<span class='text'>Over the course of his output, one senses an ever-increasing interest in cyclic integration that culminates in his masterpiece, the Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>8 in C minor, a work whose final page integrates the main themes of all four movements simultaneously</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==== The Bruckner Problem ===={{Further|The Versions and Editions of Bruckner's Symphonies}}&quot;The Bruckner Problem&quot; is a term that refers to the difficulties and complications resulting from the numerous contrasting versions and editions that exist for most of the symphonies</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[H</span>
				<span class='text'>C</span>
				<span class='text'>Robbins Landon]], ''The Symphonies of Joseph Haydn''</span>
				<span class='text'>London: Universal Edition &amp; Rockliff (1955): 101</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;The Bruckner problem is </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>complicated by the fact that not only did the composer often revise his own works but to a certain extent sanctioned the alterations, even those on the largest scale, which his pupils and others found it advisable to make</span>
				<span class='text'>The case of Haydn is simpler, since we are not faced with two or more alternatives but with one</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The term gained currency following the publication (in 1969) of an article dealing with the subject, &quot;The Bruckner Problem Simplified,&quot; by [[Musicology|musicologist]] [[Deryck Cooke]], which brought the issue to the attention of English-speaking musicians</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cooke(1969)&lt;/ref&gt;The first versions of the Bruckner's symphonies often presented an instrumental, contrapuntal and rhythmic complexity ([[Bruckner rhythm|Brucknerian rhythm &quot;2 + 3&quot;]], use of [[Tuplet|quintolet]]s), the originality of which has not been understood and considered unperformable by the musicians</span>
				<span class='text'>In order to make them &quot;performable&quot;, the symphonies, except Symphonies [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>6 (Bruckner)|No</span>
				<span class='text'>6]] and [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>7 (Bruckner)|No</span>
				<span class='text'>7]], have been revised several times</span>
				<span class='text'>Consequently, there are several versions and editions, mainly of Symphonies [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>3 (Bruckner)|3]], [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>4 (Bruckner)|4]] and [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>8 (Bruckner)|8]], which have been deeply emended by Bruckner's friends and associates, and it is not always possible to tell whether the emendations had Bruckner's direct authorization</span>
				<span class='text'>ooking for authentic versions of the symphonies, [[Robert Haas (musicologist)|Robert Haas]] produced during the 1930s a first [[Critical apparatus|critical edition]] of Bruckner's works based on the original scores</span>

				<span class='text'>He wrote a [[Te Deum (Bruckner)|Te Deum]], five [[Psalms (Bruckner)|psalm settings]] (including [[Psalm 150 (Bruckner)|Psalm 150]] in the 1890s), a [[Festive Cantata (Bruckner)|Festive cantata]], a [[Magnificat (Bruckner)|Magnificat]], about forty [[Motets (Bruckner)|motets]] (among them eight settings of ''[[Tantum ergo]]'', and three settings of both ''[[Christus factus est]]'' and ''[[Hail Mary|Ave Maria]]''), and at least seven [[Masses (Bruckner)|Masses]]</span>
				<span class='text'>he three early masses (''[[Windhaager Messe]]'', ''[[Kronstorfer Messe]]'' and ''[[Messe für den Gründonnerstag]]''), composed between 1842 and 1844, were short Austrian ''Landmessen'' for use in local churches and did not always set all the numbers of the ordinary</span>
				<span class='text'>His [[Requiem (Bruckner)|Requiem in D minor]] of 1849 is the earliest work Bruckner himself considered worthy of preservation</span>
				<span class='text'>It shows the clear influence of Mozart's Requiem (also in D minor) and similar works of Michael Haydn</span>
				<span class='text'>The seldom performed [[Missa solemnis (Bruckner)|''Missa solemnis'']], composed in 1854 for Friedrich Mayer's elevation, was the last major work Bruckner composed before he started to study with Simon Sechter, with the possible exception of [[Psalm 146 (Bruckner)|Psalm 146]], a large work, for SATB soloists, double choir and orchestra</span>
				<span class='text'>he three Masses, which Bruckner wrote in the 1860s and revised later on in his life, are more often performed</span>
				<span class='text'>The Masses numbered [[Mass No</span>
				<span class='text'>1 (Bruckner)|1 in D minor]] and [[Mass No</span>
				<span class='text'>3 (Bruckner)|3 in F minor]] are for solo singers, mixed choir, organ ''[[ad libitum]]'' and orchestra, while [[Mass No</span>

				<span class='text'>The Cecilians wanted to rid church music of instruments entirely</span>
				<span class='text'>No</span>
				<span class='text'>3 was clearly meant for concert, rather than liturgical performance, and it is the only one of his Masses in which he set the first line of the Gloria, &quot;Gloria in excelsis Deo&quot;, and of the Credo, &quot;Credo in unum Deum&quot;, to music</span>
				<span class='text'>In concert performances of the other Masses, these lines are intoned by a tenor soloist in the way a priest would, with a line of [[plainsong]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Florian Monastery|St Florian's Priory]], where he improvised frequently</span>
				<span class='text'>Those improvisations were usually not transcribed, so that only a few of his [[Organ works (Bruckner)|work for organ]] has survived</span>
				<span class='text'>The five Preludes in E-flat major (1836–1837), classified WAB 127 and WAB 128, as well as a few other WAB-unclassified works, which have been found in Bruckner's ''Präludienbuch'', are probably not by Bruckner</span>

				<span class='text'>&quot;Studying ''Tristan'' Bruckner used a piano score without text – a sign of how unconcerned he was with opera as drama</span>

				<span class='text'>ecades after his death, the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nazis]] strongly approved of Bruckner's music because they saw it as expressing the [[zeitgeist]] of the [[Germans|German]] [[volk]], and [[Hitler]] even consecrated a bust of Bruckner in a widely photographed ceremony in 1937 at [[Regensburg]]'s [[Walhalla temple]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Bruckner's music was among the most popular in Nazi Germany and the Adagio from his Seventh Symphony was broadcast by German radio (Deutscher Reichsrundfunk) when it broadcast the news of Hitler's death on 1 May 1945</span>
				<span class='text'>However, this did not hurt Bruckner's standing in the postwar media, and several movies and TV productions in Europe and the United States have used excerpts from his music ever since the 1950s, as they already did in the 1930s</span>

				<span class='text'>ruckner's symphonic works, much maligned in Vienna in his lifetime, now have an important place in the tradition and musical repertoire of the [[Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra]]</span>
				<span class='text'>he life of Bruckner was portrayed in [[Jan Schmidt-Garre]]'s 1995 film ''Bruckner's Decision'', which focuses on his recovery in the Austrian spa</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Ken Russell]]'s TV movie ''The Strange Affliction of Anton Bruckner'', starring [[Peter Mackriel]], also fictionalizes Bruckner's real-life stay at a sanatorium because of [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] (or 'numeromania' as it was then described)</span>
