				<span class='text'>orn in [[Hodgenville, Kentucky]], Lincoln grew up on the [[American frontier|western frontier]] in [[Kentucky]] and [[Indiana]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Largely self-educated, he became a lawyer in [[Illinois]], a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party leader]], and a member of the [[Illinois House of Representatives]], in which he served for twelve years</span>
				<span class='text'>Elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1846, Lincoln promoted rapid modernization of the economy through banks, tariffs, and railroads</span>
				<span class='text'>Because he had originally agreed not to run for a second term in Congress, and because his opposition to the [[Mexican–American War]] was unpopular among Illinois voters, Lincoln returned to [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]] and resumed his successful law practice</span>
				<span class='text'>Reentering politics in 1854, he became a leader in building the new [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], which had a statewide majority in Illinois</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1858, while taking part in a [[Lincoln–Douglas debates|series of highly publicized debates]] with his opponent and rival, Democrat [[Stephen A</span>
				<span class='text'>Douglas]], Lincoln spoke out against the expansion of slavery, but lost the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Senate race to Douglas</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1860, Lincoln secured the Republican Party presidential nomination as a moderate from a swing state</span>
				<span class='text'>With very little support in the slaveholding states of the South, he swept the North and was [[United States presidential election, 1860|elected president in 1860]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His victory prompted seven southern slave states to form the [[Confederate States of America]] before he moved into the [[White House]] - no compromise or reconciliation was found regarding slavery and secession</span>
				<span class='text'>Subsequently, on April 12, 1861, a Confederate attack on [[Fort Sumter]] inspired the North to enthusiastically rally behind the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] in a declaration of war</span>
				<span class='text'>As the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican Party, Lincoln confronted Radical Republicans, who demanded harsher treatment of the South, [[War Democrats]], who called for more compromise, anti-war Democrats (called [[Copperhead (politics)|Copperheads]]), who despised him, and irreconcilable secessionists, who plotted his assassination</span>
				<span class='text'>Politically, Lincoln fought back by pitting his opponents against each other, by carefully planned political [[patronage]], and by appealing to the American people with his powers of oratory</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Randall (1947), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>65–87</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; His [[Gettysburg Address]] became an iconic endorsement of the principles of nationalism, republicanism, equal rights, liberty, and democracy</span>
				<span class='text'>incoln initially concentrated on the military and political dimensions of the war</span>
				<span class='text'>His primary goal was to reunite the nation</span>
				<span class='text'>He suspended [[habeas corpus]], leading to the controversial ''[[ex parte Merryman]]'' decision, and he averted potential British intervention in the war by defusing the [[Trent Affair]] in late 1861</span>
				<span class='text'>Lincoln closely supervised the war effort, especially the selection of top generals, including his most successful general, [[Ulysses S</span>
				<span class='text'>Grant]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also made major decisions on Union war strategy, including a naval blockade that shut down the South's normal trade, moves to take control of Kentucky and Tennessee, and using gunboats to gain control of the southern river system</span>
				<span class='text'>Lincoln tried repeatedly to capture the Confederate capital at [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]; each time a general failed, Lincoln substituted another, until finally Grant succeeded</span>
				<span class='text'>As the war progressed, his complex moves toward ending slavery began with the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] of 1863; subsequently, Lincoln used the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Army to protect escaped slaves, encouraged the [[Border States (American Civil War)|border states]] to outlaw slavery, and pushed through Congress the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which permanently outlawed slavery</span>
				<span class='text'>n exceptionally astute politician deeply involved with power issues in each state, Lincoln reached out to the War Democrats and managed his own re-election campaign in the [[United States presidential election, 1864|1864 presidential election]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Anticipating the war's conclusion, Lincoln pushed a moderate view of [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]], seeking to reunite the nation speedily through a policy of generous reconciliation in the face of lingering and bitter divisiveness</span>
				<span class='text'>On April 14, 1865, five days after the April 9th surrender of Confederate commanding general [[Robert E</span>
				<span class='text'>Lee]], Lincoln was assassinated by [[John Wilkes Booth]], a Confederate sympathizer</span>

				<span class='text'>McClellan's repeated delays frustrated Lincoln and Congress, as did his position that no troops were needed to defend Washington</span>

				<span class='text'>290–291</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;On June 19, 1862, endorsed by Lincoln, Congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory</span>
				<span class='text'>In July, the [[Confiscation Act of 1862]] was passed, which set up court procedures that could free the slaves of anyone convicted of aiding the rebellion</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Lincoln believed it was not within Congress's power to free the slaves within the states, he approved the bill in deference to the legislature</span>
				<span class='text'>He felt such action could only be taken by the Commander-in-Chief using war powers granted to the president by the Constitution, and Lincoln was planning to take that action</span>
				<span class='text'>In that month, Lincoln discussed a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation with his cabinet</span>
				<span class='text'>In it, he stated that &quot;as a fit and necessary military measure, on January 1, 1863, all persons held as slaves in the Confederate states will thenceforward, and forever, be free&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Lincoln's comment on the signing of the Proclamation was: &quot;I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper</span>

				<span class='text'>In a letter to [[Andrew Johnson]], the military governor of Tennessee, encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops, Lincoln wrote, &quot;The bare sight of 50,000 armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the Mississippi would end the rebellion at once&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Lincoln arranged for an intermediary to make inquiry into Grant's political intentions, and being assured that he had none, submitted to the Senate Grant's promotion to commander of the Union Army</span>

				<span class='text'>113</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The high casualty figures of the Union alarmed the North; Grant had lost a third of his army, and Lincoln asked what Grant's plans were, to which the general replied, &quot;I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer</span>

				<span class='text'>As early as the 1850s, a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the Constitution, Lincoln redirected emphasis to the Declaration of Independence as the foundation of American political values—what he called the &quot;sheet anchor&quot; of republicanism</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jaffa, p</span>
				<span class='text'>399</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The Declaration's emphasis on freedom and equality for all, in contrast to the Constitution's tolerance of slavery, shifted the debate</span>
				<span class='text'>As Diggins concludes regarding the highly influential Cooper Union speech of early 1860, &quot;Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Diggins, p</span>
				<span class='text'>307</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; His position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism, rather than its legalisms</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Foner (2010), p</span>
				<span class='text'>215</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in 1861, Lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms (the Constitution was a contract, and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree), and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jaffa, p</span>
				<span class='text'>263</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Burton (2008) argues that Lincoln's republicanism was taken up by the Freedmen as they were emancipated</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Orville Vernon Burton, ''The Age of Lincoln'' (2008) p 243&lt;/ref&gt;In March 1861, in [[Lincoln's first inaugural address]], he explored the nature of democracy</span>
				<span class='text'>He denounced secession as anarchy, and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints in the American system</span>
				<span class='text'>He said &quot;A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations, and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people</span>

				<span class='text'>86</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;{{Clear}}===Other enactments===Lincoln adhered to the Whig theory of the presidency, which gave Congress primary responsibility for writing the laws while the Executive enforced them</span>
				<span class='text'>Lincoln vetoed only four bills passed by Congress; the only important one was the Wade-Davis Bill with its harsh program of Reconstruction</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Donald (2001), p</span>
				<span class='text'>137</span>

				<span class='text'>116</span>

				<span class='text'>76, 79, 106, 110</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Schwartz argues that Lincoln's reputation grew slowly in the late 19th century until the [[Progressive Era]] (1900–1920s) when he emerged as one of the most venerated heroes in American history, with even white Southerners in agreement</span>
				<span class='text'>The high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the [[Lincoln Memorial]] on the Mall in Washington</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Schwartz (2000), p</span>
				<span class='text'>109</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In the [[New Deal]] era liberals honored Lincoln not so much as the self-made man or the great war president, but as the advocate of the common man who doubtless would have supported the welfare state</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Striner, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>2–4</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The emphasis shifted away from Lincoln-the-emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery, or at least were responsible for pressuring the government on emancipation</span>
