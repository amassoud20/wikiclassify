				<span class='text'>Lincoln biographers  and  according to David Lincove argue thatIt is likely that had he lived Lincoln would have followed a policy similar to Johnsons that he would have clashed with congressional Radicals that he would have produced a better result for the freedmen than occurred and that his political skills would have helped him avoid Johnsons mistakes</span>
				<span class='text'> argues thatUnlike Sumner and other Radicals Lincoln did not see Reconstruction as an opportunity for a sweeping political and social revolution beyond emancipation</span>
				<span class='text'>He had long made clear his opposition to the confiscation and redistribution of land</span>
				<span class='text'>He believed as most Republicans did in April 1865 that the voting requirements should be determined by the states</span>
				<span class='text'>He assumed that political control in the South would pass to white Unionists reluctant secessionists and forward looking former Confederates</span>
