				<span class='text'>In contrast with his mother's conversion to [[History of Christianity#High Middle Ages (800‚Äì1299)|Christianity]], Sviatoslav remained a staunch [[paganism|pagan]] all of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>Due to his abrupt death in ambush, his conquests, for the most part, were not consolidated into a functioning empire, while his failure to establish a stable succession led to a [[fratricide|fratricidal]] feud among his sons, resulting in two of his three sons being killed</span>
				<span class='text'>=Name==Sviatoslav is the first ruler of the [[Kievan Rus']] recorded in the [[Primary Chronicle]] with a name of [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] origin (as opposed to his predecessors, whose names derived from [[Old Norse]])</span>
				<span class='text'>This name, however, is not recorded in other medieval Slavic countries</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, Sveinald is the Old East Norse cognate with the Slavic form as attested in the patronymic Old East Norse name of [[Vladimir I of Kiev|Vladimir]]: Valdamarr Sveinaldsson</span>
				<span class='text'>This [[patronymic]] naming convention, interestingly, continues namely in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and in [[East Slavic languages]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Even in Rus', it was attested only among the members of the [[Rurik Dynasty|house of Rurik]], as were the names of Sviatoslav's immediate successors: [[Vladimir I of Kiev|Vladimir]], [[Yaroslav I the Wise|Yaroslav]], and [[Mstislav I of Kiev|Mstislav]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, such a compound structure name was already known from Great Moravia, as in the rulers named Svatopluk</span>
				<span class='text'>Clearly Sviatoslav's name belongs to this tradition, as he had a son by the name of Yaropolk, of much the same form, and a grandson by the same name, Sviatopolk</span>
				<span class='text'>=Early life and personality==Virtually nothing is known about Sviatoslav's childhood and youth, which he spent reigning in [[Velikiy Novgorod|Novgorod]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Sviatoslav's father, [[Igor, Grand Prince of Kiev|Igor]], was killed by the [[Drevlyans|Drevlians]] around 945, and his mother, [[Olga of Kiev|Olga]], ruled as [[regent]] in [[Kiev]] until Sviatoslav reached maturity (ca</span>
				<span class='text'>963)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;If Olga was indeed born in 879, as the [[Primary Chronicle]] seems to imply, she should have been about 65 at the time of Sviatoslav's birth</span>
				<span class='text'>There are clearly some problems with chronology</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Sviatoslav was tutored by a [[Varangians|Varangian]] named Asmud</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Primary Chronicle'' entry for 968&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition of employing Varangian tutors for the sons of ruling princes survived well into the 11th century</span>
				<span class='text'>Sviatoslav appears to have had little patience for administration</span>
				<span class='text'>His life was spent with his ''[[druzhina]]'' (roughly, &quot;company&quot;) in permanent warfare against neighboring states</span>
				<span class='text'> According to the Primary Chronicle, he carried on his expeditions neither wagons nor kettles, and he boiled no meat, rather cutting off small strips of horseflesh, game, or beef to eat after roasting it on the coals</span>
				<span class='text'>Nor did he have a tent, rather spreading out a horse-blanket under him and setting his saddle under his head, and all his retinue did likewise</span>

				<span class='text'>]Very little is known of Sviatoslav's family life</span>
				<span class='text'>It is possible that he was not the only (or the eldest) son of his parents</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Rus'-Byzantine Treaty (945)|Russo-Byzantine treaty of 945]] mentions a certain Predslava, Volodislav's wife, as the noblest of the Rus' women after Olga</span>
				<span class='text'>The fact that Predslava was Oleg's mother is presented by [[Vasily Tatishchev]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also speculated that Predslava was of a Hungarian nobility</span>
				<span class='text'>[[George Vernadsky]] was among many historians to speculate that Volodislav was Igor's eldest son and heir who died at some point during Olga's regency</span>
				<span class='text'>Another chronicle told that Oleg (? - 944?) was the eldest son of Igor</span>
				<span class='text'>At the time of Igor's death, Sviatoslav was still a child,&lt;!--&quot;a baby&quot;, following the Primary Chronicle</span>
				<span class='text'>-&gt; and he was raised by his mother or under her instructions</span>
				<span class='text'>Her influence, however, did not extend to his religious observance</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Svatoslav titularnik</span>
				<span class='text'>ng|thumb|upright|Sviatoslav I in the ''Tsarsky Titulyarnik'', 1672]]Sviatoslav had several children, but the origin of his wives is not specified in the chronicle</span>
				<span class='text'>By his wives, he had [[Yaropolk I of Kiev|Yaropolk]] and [[Oleg of Drelinia|Oleg]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt; Shared maternal paternity of Yaropolk and Oleg is a matter of debate by historians</span>

				<span class='text'>[[John Skylitzes]] reported that Vladimir had a brother named [[Sfengus]]&lt;!--Sven?--&gt;; whether this Sfengus was a son of Sviatoslav, a son of Malusha by a prior or subsequent husband, or an unrelated Rus' nobleman is unclear</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Indeed, Franklin and Shepard advanced the hypothesis that Sfengus was identical with [[Mstislav of Tmutarakan]]</span>

				<span class='text'>ng|thumb|left|The Kievan Rus' at the beginning of Sviatoslav's reign (in red), showing his sphere of influence to 972 (in orange)]]Shortly after his accession to the throne, Sviatoslav began campaigning to expand Rus' control over the Volga valley and the [[Pontic-Caspian steppe|Pontic steppe]] region</span>
				<span class='text'>His greatest success was the conquest of [[Khazars|Khazaria]], which for centuries had been one of the strongest states of [[Eastern Europe]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The sources are not clear about the roots of the conflict between Khazaria and Rus', so several possibilities have been suggested</span>
				<span class='text'>The Rus' had an interest in removing the Khazar hold on the [[Volga trade route]] because the Khazars collected duties from the goods transported by the Volga</span>
				<span class='text'>Historians have suggested that the Byzantine Empire may have incited the Rus' against the Khazars, who fell out with the Byzantines after the persecutions of the [[History of the Jews in Russia and the Soviet Union#Early history|Jew]]s in the reign of [[Romanos I|Romanus I Lecapenus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Rus&quot;&gt;&quot;Rus&quot;, ''Encyclopaedia of Islam''&lt;/ref&gt;Sviatoslav began by rallying the [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] vassal tribes of the Khazars to his cause</span>
				<span class='text'>Those who would not join him, such as the [[Vyatichs]], were attacked and forced to pay tribute to the Kievan Rus' rather than to the Khazars</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Christian 345</span>
				<span class='text'>It is disputed whether Sviatoslav invaded the land of Vyatichs that year</span>
				<span class='text'>The only campaign against the Vyatichs explicitly mentioned in the Primary Chronicle is dated to 966</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; According to a legend recorded in the Primary Chronicle, Sviatoslav sent a message to the Vyatich rulers, consisting of a single phrase: &quot;I want to come at you!&quot; ([[Old East Slavic]]: &quot;—Ö–æ—â—é –Ω–∞ –≤—ã –∏—Ç–∏&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;[http://litopys</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Christian 298</span>
				<span class='text'>The Primary Chronicle is very succinct about the whole campaign against the Khazars, saying only that Sviatoslav &quot;took their city and Belaya Vezha&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; At Sarkel he established a Rus' settlement called Belaya Vyezha (&quot;the white tower&quot; or &quot;the white fortress&quot;, the East Slavic translation for &quot;Sarkel&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;The town was an important trade center located near the [[portage]] between the Volga and [[Don River (Russia)|Don Rivers]]</span>
				<span class='text'>By the early 12th century, however, it had been destroyed by the [[Kipchaks]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently destroyed the Khazar capital of [[Atil]]</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Logan (1992), p</span>
				<span class='text'>202&lt;/ref&gt; The exact chronology of his Khazar campaign is uncertain and disputed; for example, [[Mikhail Artamonov]] and [[David Christian (historian)|David Christian]] proposed that the sack of Sarkel came after the destruction of Atil</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Artamonov 428; Christian 298</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Although [[Ibn Hawqal|Ibn Haukal]] reports the sack of [[Samandar (city)|Samandar]] by Sviatoslav, the Rus' leader did not bother to occupy the Khazar heartlands north of the [[Caucasus Mountains]] permanently</span>
				<span class='text'>On his way back to Kiev, Sviatoslav chose to strike against the [[Ossetians]] and force them into subservience</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;The campaign against the Ossetians is attested in the Primary Chronicle</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Novgorod First Chronicle]] specifies that Sviatoslav resettled the Ossetians near Kiev, but Sakharov finds this claim dubitable</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Khazar successor statelets continued their precarious existence in the region</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;The [[Mandgelis Document]] refers to a Khazar potentate in the [[Taman Peninsula]] around 985, long after Sviatoslav's death</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Georgios Kedrenos|Kedrenos]] reported that the Byzantines and Rus' collaborated in the conquest of a Khazar kingdom in the Crimea in 1016, and still later, [[Ali ibn al-Athir|Ibn al-Athir]] reported an unsuccessful attack by [[Al-Fadhl ibn Muhammad|al-Fadl ibn Muhammad]] against the Khazars in the Caucasus in 1030</span>
				<span class='text'>For more information on these and other references, ''see'' [[Khazars#Late references to the Khazars]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The destruction of Khazar imperial power paved the way for Kievan Rus' to dominate north-south trade routes through the steppe and across the [[Black Sea]], routes that formerly had been a major source of revenue for the Khazars</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, Sviatoslav's campaigns led to increased Slavic settlement in the region of the [[Saltovo-Mayaki]] culture, greatly changing the demographics and culture of the transitional area between the forest and the steppe</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Most historians believe the Greeks were interested in the destruction of Khazaria</span>
				<span class='text'>Another school of thought essentializes the report of [[Yahya of Antioch]] that, prior to the Danube campaign, the Byzantines and the Rus' were at war</span>
				<span class='text'>See Sakharov, chapter I</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Close military ties between the Rus' and Byzantium are illustrated by the fact, reported by John Skylitzes, that a Rus' detachment accompanied Byzantine Emperor [[Nikephoros II|Nikephoros Phokas]] in his victorious naval expedition to [[Crete]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 967 or 968,&lt;ref&gt;The exact date of Sviatoslav's Bulgarian campaign, which likely did not commence until the conclusion of his Khazar campaign, is unknown</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Nikephoros sent to Sviatoslav his agent, [[Kalokyros]], with the task of talking Sviatoslav into assisting him in a war against [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[Mikhail Tikhomirov]] and [[Vladimir Pashuto]], among others, assume that the Emperor was interested primarily in diverting Sviatoslav's attention from [[Chersonesos Taurica|Chersonesos]], a Byzantine possession in the [[Crimea]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Indeed, Leo the Deacon three times mentions that Sviatoslav and his father Igor controlled [[Strait of Kerch|Cimmerian Bosporus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>If so, a conflict of interests in the Crimea was inevitable</span>
				<span class='text'>The Suzdal Chronicle, though a rather late source, also mentions Sviatoslav's war against Chersonesos</span>
				<span class='text'>In the [[Siege of Dorostolon|peace treaty of 971]], Sviatoslav promised not to wage wars against either [[Constantinople]] or Chersonesos</span>
				<span class='text'>Byzantine sources also report that Kalokyros attempted to persuade Sviatoslav to support Kalokyros in a coup against the reigning Byzantine emperor</span>
				<span class='text'>As remuneration for his help, Sviatoslav was supposed to retain a permanent hold on Bulgaria</span>
				<span class='text'>Modern historians, however, assign little historical importance to this story</span>
				<span class='text'>Kendrick 157</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Sviatoslav was paid 15,000 pounds of gold and set sail with an army of 60,000 men, including thousands of Pecheneg mercenaries</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;All figures in this article, including the numbers of Sviatoslav's troops, are based on the reports of Byzantine sources, which may differ from those of the Slavonic chronicles</span>
				<span class='text'>Greek sources report Khazars and &quot;Turks&quot; in Sviatoslav's army as well as Pechenegs</span>
				<span class='text'>As used in such Byzantine writings as ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' by Constantine Porphyrogenitus, &quot;Turks&quot; refers to [[Hungarian people|Magyars]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Meanwhile, the Byzantines bribed the Pechenegs to [[Siege of Kiev (968)|attack and besiege Kiev]], where Olga stayed with Sviatoslav's son Vladimir</span>
				<span class='text'>The siege was relieved by the ''druzhina'' of [[Siege of Kiev (968)|Pretich]], and immediately following the Pecheneg retreat, Olga sent a reproachful letter to Sviatoslav</span>
				<span class='text'>He promptly returned and defeated the Pechenegs, who continued to threaten Kiev</span>
				<span class='text'>{Campaignbox Russo-Byzantine Wars}}Sviatoslav refused to turn his Balkan conquests over to the Byzantines, and the parties fell out as a result</span>
				<span class='text'>To the chagrin of his [[boyar]]s and his mother (who died within three days after learning about his decision), Sviatoslav decided to move his capital to [[Pereyaslavets]] in the mouth of the Danube due to the great potential of that location as a commercial hub</span>
				<span class='text'>In the Primary Chronicle record for 969, Sviatoslav explains that it is to Pereyaslavets, the centre of his lands, &quot;all the riches flow: gold, silks, wine, and various fruits from [[Greece]], silver and horses from [[Hungary]] and [[Bohemia]], and from Rus' furs, wax, honey, and slaves&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>At the head of an army that included Pecheneg and Magyar auxiliary troops, he invaded Bulgaria again, devastating [[Thrace]], capturing the city of [[Plovdiv|Philippopolis]], and massacring its inhabitants</span>

				<span class='text'>Challenging the Byzantine authority, Sviatoslav crossed the Danube and laid siege to [[Edirne|Adrianople]], causing panic on the streets of Constantinople in summer 970</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Simultaneously, [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] attacked Byzantine possessions in the south of Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>This remarkable coincidence may be interpreted as an evidence of the anti-Byzantine German-Russian alliance</span>
				<span class='text'>See: Manteuffel 41</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, the Byzantines launched a counteroffensive</span>
				<span class='text'>Being occupied with suppressing a revolt of [[Bardas Phokas the Younger|Bardas Phokas]] in [[Asia Minor]], John Tzimiskes sent his commander-in-chief, [[Bardas Skleros]], who defeated the coalition of Rus', Pechenegs, Magyars, and Bulgarians in the [[Battle of Arcadiopolis (970)|Battle of Arcadiopolis]]</span>

				<span class='text'>The Byzantine sources report the enemy casualties to be as high as 20,000, a figure modern historians find to be highly improbable</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, John, having quelled the revolt of Bardas Phokas, came to the Balkans with a large army and promoting himself as the liberator of Bulgaria from Sviatoslav, penetrated the impracticable mountain passes and shortly thereafter captured [[Marcianopolis]], where the Rus' were holding a number of Bulgar princes hostage</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:64-manasses-chronicle</span>

				<span class='text'>Cut off and surrounded, Sviatoslav came to terms with John and agreed to abandon the Balkans, renounce his claims to the southern Crimea, and return west of the [[Dnieper River]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In return, the Byzantine emperor supplied the Rus' with food and safe passage home</span>
				<span class='text'>Sviatoslav and his men set sail and landed on [[Berezan Island]] at the mouth of the Dnieper, where they made camp for the winter</span>
				<span class='text'>Several months later, their camp was devastated by famine, so that even a horse's head could not be bought for less than a half-[[Ukrainian hryvnia|grivna]], reports the Kievan chronicler of the Primary Chronicle</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Franklin and Shepard 149‚Äì150&lt;/ref&gt; While Sviatoslav's campaign brought no tangible results for the Rus', it weakened the Bulgarian statehood and left it vulnerable to the attacks of [[Basil II|Basil the Bulgar-Slayer]] four decades later</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|upright|''The Death of Sviatoslav'' by [[Boris Chorikov]]]]Fearing that the peace with Sviatoslav would not endure, the Byzantine emperor induced the Pecheneg [[Khan (title)|khan]] [[Kurya (khan)|Kurya]] to kill Sviatoslav before he reached Kiev</span>
				<span class='text'>This was in line with the policy outlined by [[Constantine VII]] Porphyrogenitus in ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' of fomenting strife between the Rus' and the Pechenegs</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Constantine VII pointed out that, by virtue of their controlling the Dnieper cataracts, the Pechenegs may easily attack and destroy the Rus' vessels sailing along the river</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; According to the Slavic chronicle, [[Sveneld]] attempted to warn Sviatoslav to avoid the [[Khortytsia|Dnieper rapids]], but the prince slighted his wise advice and was ambushed and slain by the Pechenegs when he tried to cross the cataracts near [[Khortytsia|Khortitsa]] early in 972</span>
				<span class='text'>The Primary Chronicle reports that his skull was [[skull cup|made into a chalice]] by the Pecheneg khan</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;The use of a defeated enemy's skull as a drinking vessel is reported by numerous authors through history among various steppe peoples, such as the [[Scythians]]</span>

				<span class='text'>His figure first attracted attention of Russian artists and poets during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768‚Äì1774)]], which provided obvious parallels with Sviatoslav's push towards Constantinople</span>
