				<span class='text'>He also concluded that most pre-industrial and pre-authoritarian societies (where he claimed that [[leadership]], central government and class did not exist) actively defend against the accumulation of private property by, for example, equally distributing within the community a person's possessions when he died, or by not allowing a gift to be sold, bartered or used to create wealth (see [[Gift economy]])</span>

				<span class='text'>It was an anarchism that opposed centralized government and state-level laws as traditional anarchism did, but understood that at a certain small scale, communities and communes and co-ops could flourish and provide humans with a rich material life and wide areas of liberty without centralized control</span>
