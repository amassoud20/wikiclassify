				<span class='text'>Butterfly]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>He had come back to Britain after living for a number of years in Hollywood, having all but given up on a career there, saying, &quot;Well that part of my life's over; it's a chapter closed</span>
				<span class='text'>I suppose I'll just have to settle for being a respectable actor poncing around the West End and doing respectable BBC work for the rest of my life</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;falk&quot; /&gt;Hopkins played the iconic villain in adaptations of the first three of the Lecter novels by [[Thomas Harris]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The author was reportedly very pleased with Hopkins' portrayal of his antagonist</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Hopkins stated that ''[[Red Dragon (film)|Red Dragon]]'' would feature his final performance as the character, and that he would not reprise even a narrative role in the latest addition to the series, ''[[Hannibal Rising (film)|Hannibal Rising]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>=Acting style==[[File:Anthony Hopkins-Tuscan Sun Festival</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|upright|Hopkins at the [[Tuscan Sun Festival]], [[Cortona]], [[Italy]], August 2009]]Hopkins is renowned for his preparation for roles</span>
				<span class='text'>He indicated in interviews that once he has committed to a project, he will go over his lines as many times as is needed (sometimes upwards of 200) until the lines sound natural to him, so that he can &quot;do it without thinking&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>This leads to an almost casual style of delivery that belies the amount of groundwork done beforehand</span>
				<span class='text'>While it can allow for some careful improvisation, it has also brought him into conflict with the occasional director who departs from the script, or demands what the actor views as an excessive number of takes</span>
				<span class='text'>Hopkins has stated that after he is finished with a scene, he simply discards the lines, not remembering them later on</span>
				<span class='text'>This is unlike others who usually remember their lines from a film, even years later</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;&quot;Anthony Hopkins: Lecter and Me&quot;&amp;nbsp;— ''Red Dragon'' DVD interview&lt;/ref&gt;[[Richard Attenborough]], who directed Hopkins on five occasions, found himself going to great lengths during the filming of ''[[Shadowlands (1993 film)|Shadowlands]]'' (1993) to accommodate the differing approaches of his two stars (Hopkins and [[Debra Winger]]), who shared many scenes</span>
				<span class='text'>Whereas Hopkins, preferring the spontaneity of a fresh take, liked to keep rehearsals to a minimum, Winger rehearsed continuously</span>
				<span class='text'>To allow for this, Attenborough stood in for Hopkins during Winger's rehearsals, only bringing him in for the last one before a take</span>
				<span class='text'>The director praised Hopkins for &quot;this extraordinary ability to make you believe when you hear him that it is the very first time he has ever said that line</span>
				<span class='text'>It's an incredible gift</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;falk&quot; /&gt;Renowned for his ability to remember lines, Hopkins keeps his memory supple by learning things by heart such as poetry, and Shakespeare</span>
				<span class='text'>In Steven Spielberg's ''[[Amistad (film)|Amistad]]'', Hopkins astounded the crew with his memorisation of a seven-page courtroom speech, delivering it in one go</span>
				<span class='text'>An overawed Spielberg couldn't bring himself to call him Tony, and insisted on addressing him as Sir Anthony throughout the shoot</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;RADA&quot; /&gt;Hopkins is a gifted [[Impressionist (entertainment)|mimic]], adept at turning his native Welsh accent into whatever is required by a character</span>
				<span class='text'>He duplicated the voice of his late mentor, Laurence Olivier, for additional scenes in ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'' in its 1991 restoration</span>
				<span class='text'>His interview on the 1998 relaunch edition of the British TV talk show ''[[Parkinson (TV series)|Parkinson]]'' featured an impersonation of comedian [[Tommy Cooper]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Hopkins has said acting &quot;like a submarine&quot; has helped him to deliver credible performances in his thriller movies</span>
				<span class='text'>He said, &quot;It's very difficult for an actor to avoid, you want to show a bit</span>
				<span class='text'>But I think the less one shows the better</span>
