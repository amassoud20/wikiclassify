				<span class='text'>He is best known for his work on founding the field of [[human–computer interaction]], particularly while at his [[Augmentation Research Center]] Lab in [[SRI International]], resulting in the invention of the [[Mouse (computing)|computer mouse]], and the development of [[hypertext]], networked computers, and precursors to [[graphical user interface]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>These were demonstrated at [[The Mother of All Demos]] in 1968</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Engelbart's Law]], the observation that the intrinsic rate of human performance is exponential, is named after him</span>
				<span class='text'>n the early 1950s, he decided that instead of &quot;having a steady job&quot; – such as his position at NASA's Ames Research Center – he would focus on making the world a better place</span>
				<span class='text'> He reasoned that because the complexity of the world's problems were increasing, and that any effort to improve the world would require the coordination of groups of people, the most effective way to solve problems was to augment human intelligence and develop ways of building collective intelligence</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Interview with Doug Engelbart&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Markoff|first1=John|url=https://www</span>
				<span class='text'>outube</span>
				<span class='text'>om/watch?v=VeSgaJt27PM}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that the computer, which previously was at the time thought of only as a tool for automation, would be an essential tool for future knowledge workers to solve such problems</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a committed, vocal proponent of the development and use of computers and [[computer network]]s to help cope with the world’s increasingly urgent and complex problems</span>
				<span class='text'>Engelbart embedded a set of organizing principles in his lab, which he termed &quot;bootstrapping&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>His belief was that when human systems and tool systems were aligned, such that workers spent time &quot;improving their tools for improving their tools&quot; it would lead to an accelerating rate of progress</span>
				<span class='text'>nder Engelbart's guidance, the Augmentation Research Center developed, with funding primarily from [[DARPA]], the [[NLS (computer system)|NLS]] to demonstrate numerous technologies, most of which are now in widespread use; this included the computer mouse, bitmapped screens, hypertext; all of which were displayed at The Mother of All Demos in 1968</span>
				<span class='text'>The lab was transferred from SRI to Tymshare in the late 1970s, which was acquired by McDonnell Douglas in 1984, and NLS was renamed Augment</span>
				<span class='text'>At both Tymshare and McDonnell Douglas, Engelbart was limited by a lack of interest in his ideas and funding to pursue them, and retired in 1986</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1988, Engelbart and his daughter Christina launched the Bootstrap Institute – later known as [[The Doug Engelbart Institute]] – to promote his vision, especially at Stanford University; this effort did result in some DARPA funding to modernize the user interface of Augment</span>
				<span class='text'>In December 2000, United States President Bill Clinton awarded Engelbart the National Medal of Technology, the United States' highest technology award</span>
				<span class='text'>In December 2008, Engelbart was honored by SRI at the 40th Anniversary celebration of the 1968 &quot;Mother of All Demos&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>= Early life and education ==Engelbart was born in [[Portland, Oregon]] on January 30, 1925, to Carl Louis Engelbart and Gladys Charlotte Amelia Munson Engelbart</span>
