				<span class='text'>name Coase  According to Coase though Smith does sometimes er to the  later scholars such as  have very much exaggerated the extent to which Adam Smith was committed to a belief in a personal God name Coase God  a belief for which Coase finds little evidence in passages such as the one in the Wealth of Nations in which Smith writes that the curiosity of mankind about the great phenomena of nature such as the generation the life growth and dissolution of plants and animals has led men to enquire into their causes and that superstition first attempted to satisfy this curiosity by erring all those wonderful appearances to the immediate agency of the gods</span>
				<span class='text'>Philosophy afterwards endeavoured to account for them from more familiar causes or from such as mankind were better acquainted with than the agency of the gods</span>
				<span class='text'>name Coase God  Some other authors argue that Smiths social and economic philosophy is inherently theological and that his entire model of social order is logically dependent on the notion of Gods action in nature</span>

				<span class='text'>Published worksIn 1759 Smith published his first work The Theory of Moral Sentiments</span>
				<span class='text'>He continued making extensive revisions to the book up until his death</span>
				<span class='text'>Although The Wealth of Nations is widely regarded as Smiths most influential work it is believed that Smith himself considered The Theory of Moral Sentiments to be a superior work</span>
				<span class='text'>In the work Smith critically examines the moral thinking of his time and suggests that conscience arises from dynamic and interactive social relationships through which people seek mutual sympathy of sentiments</span>
				<span class='text'> His goal in writing the work was to explain the source of mankinds ability to form moral judgement given that people begin life with no moral sentiments at all</span>
				<span class='text'>Smith proposes a theory of sympathy in which the act of observing others and seeing the judgements they form of both others and oneself makes people aware of themselves and how others perceive their behavior</span>
				<span class='text'>The feedback we receive from perceiving or imagining others judgements creates an incentive to achieve mutual sympathy of sentiments with them and leads people to develop habits and then principles of behavior which come to constitute ones conscience</span>
				<span class='text'>Some scholars have perceived a conflict between The Theory of Moral Sentiments and The Wealth of Nations the former emphasises sympathy for others while the latter focuses on the role of self interest</span>

				<span class='text'>ery differently classical economists see in Smiths first sentences his programme to promote The Wealth of Nations</span>
				<span class='text'>Taking up the  concept of the economy as a circular process means that to have growth the inputs of period2 must excel the inputs of period1</span>
				<span class='text'>Theore the outputs of period1 not used or usable as input of period2 are regarded as unproductive labour as they do not contribute to growth</span>
				<span class='text'>This is what Smith had heard in France from among others </span>
				<span class='text'>To this French insight that unproductive labour should be pushed back to use labour more productively Smith added his own proposal that productive labour should be made even more productive by deepening the </span>
				<span class='text'>Smith argued that deepening the division of labour under competition leads to greater productivity which leads to lower prices and thus an increasing standard of living—general plenty and universal opulence—for all</span>
				<span class='text'>Extended markets and increased production lead to continuous reorganisation of production and inventing new ways of producing which lead to further increased production lower prices and increased standards of living</span>
				<span class='text'>Smiths central message is theore that under dynamic competition a growth machine secures The Wealth of Nations</span>
				<span class='text'>Smiths argument predicted Britains evolution as the workshop of the world underselling and outproducing all its competitors</span>
				<span class='text'>The opening sentences of the Wealth of Nations summarise this policyblockquoteThe annual labour of every nation is the fund which originally supplies it with all the necessaries and conveniences of life which it annually consumes </span>

				<span class='text'>df Smith also explained the relationship between growth of private property and civil governmentblockquoteMen may live together in society with some tolerable degree of security though there is no civil magistrate to protect them from the injustice of those passions</span>
				<span class='text'>But avarice and ambition in the rich in the poor the hatred of labour and the love of present ease and enjoyment are the passions which prompt to invade property passions much more steady in their operation and much more universal in their influence</span>
				<span class='text'>Wherever there is great property there is great inequality</span>
				<span class='text'>For one very rich man there must be at least five hundred poor and the affluence of the few supposes the indigence of the many</span>
				<span class='text'>The affluence of the rich excites the indignation of the poor who are often both driven by want and prompted by envy to invade his possessions</span>
				<span class='text'>It is only under the shelter of the civil magistrate that the owner of that valuable property which is acquired by the labour of many years or perhaps of many successive generations can sleep a single night in security</span>
				<span class='text'>He is at all times surrounded by unknown enemies whom though he never provoked he can never appease and from whose injustice he can be protected only by the powerful arm of the civil magistrate continually held up to chastise it</span>
				<span class='text'>The acquisition of valuable and extensive property theore necessarily requires the establishment of civil government</span>
				<span class='text'>Where there is no property or at least none that exceeds the value of two or three days labour civil government is not so necessary</span>
				<span class='text'>Civil government supposes a certain subordination</span>
				<span class='text'>But as the necessity of civil government gradually grows up with the acquisition of valuable property so the principal causes which naturally introduce subordination gradually grow up with the growth of that valuable property</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Men of inferior wealth combine to defend those of superior wealth in the possession of their property in order that men of superior wealth may combine to defend them in the possession of theirs</span>
				<span class='text'>All the inferior shepherds and herdsmen feel that the security of their own herds and flocks depends upon the security of those of the great shepherd or herdsman that the maintenance of their lesser authority depends upon that of his greater authority and that upon their subordination to him depends his power of keeping their inferiors in subordination to them</span>
				<span class='text'>They constitute a sort of little nobility who feel themselves interested to defend the property and to support the authority of their own little sovereign in order that he may be able to defend their property and to support their authority</span>
				<span class='text'>Civil government so far as it is instituted for the security of property is in reality instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor or of those who have some property against those who have none at all</span>

				<span class='text'>He supported partial public subsidies for elementary education and he believed that competition among religious institutions would provide general benefit to the society</span>
				<span class='text'>In such cases however Smith argued for local rather than centralised control Even those publick works which are of such a nature that they cannot afford any revenue for maintaining themselves </span>
