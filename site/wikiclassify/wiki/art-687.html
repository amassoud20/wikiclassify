				<span class='text'>tml}}&lt;/ref&gt;==Etymology==Zoroaster's name in his native language, [[Avestan]], was probably ''Zaraϑuštra''</span>
				<span class='text'>His English name, &quot;Zoroaster&quot;, derives from a later (5th century BCE) [[Greek language|Greek]] transcription, ''Zōroastrēs'' ({{lang|grc|Ζωροάστρης}}),&lt;ref name=&quot;Schlerath_1977_133_135&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Schlerath|1977|pp=133–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; as used in [[Xanthus (historian)|Xanthus]]'s ''[[Xanthus (historian)#Lydiaca|Lydiaca]]'' (Fragment 32) and in [[Plato]]'s ''[[First Alcibiades]]'' (122a1)</span>
				<span class='text'>This form appears subsequently in the Latin ''{{lang|la|Zōroastrēs}}'' and, in later Greek orthographies, as ''Zōroastris''</span>
				<span class='text'>The Greek form of the name appears to be based on a phonetic transliteration or semantic substitution of Avestan ''zaraϑ-'' with the Greek ''zōros'' (literally &quot;undiluted&quot;) and the Avestan ''-uštra'' with ''astron'' (&quot;[[star]]&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>n Avestan, ''Zaraϑuštra'' is generally accepted to derive from an Old Iranian ''*Zaratuštra-''; The element half of the name (''-uštra-'') is considered to be the Indo-Iranian root for &quot;camel&quot;, the entire name meaning &quot;he who can manage camels&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;Schmitt_2003&quot;/&gt;{{Ref label|ushtra_camel|a|none}}Reconstructions from later Iranian languages—particularly from the [[Iranian languages#Middle Iranian languages|Middle Persian]] (300 BCE) ''Zardusht'',{{explain|date=October 2015}} which is the form that the name took in the 9th- to 12th-century Zoroastrian texts—suggest that ''*Zaratuštra-'' might be a [[Indo-European ablaut#Zero grade|zero-grade]] form of ''*Zarantuštra-''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;Schmitt_2003&quot;/&gt;Subject then to whether ''Zaraϑuštra'' derives from ''*Zarantuštra-'' or from ''*Zaratuštra-'', several interpretations have been proposed</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The interpretation of the ''-ϑ-'' ({{IPA|/θ/}}) in Avestan ''zaraϑuštra'' was for a time itself subjected to heated debate because the ''-ϑ-'' is an irregular development: As a rule, ''*zarat-'' (a first element that ends in a [[dental consonant]]) should have Avestan ''zarat-'' or ''zarat̰-'' as a development from it</span>
				<span class='text'>Why this is not so for ''zaraϑuštra'' has not yet been determined</span>
				<span class='text'>Notwithstanding the phonetic irregularity, that Avestan ''zaraϑuštra'' with its ''-ϑ-'' was linguistically an actual form is shown by later attestations reflecting the same basis</span>

				<span class='text'> the date of composition of the Old Avestan gathas, is unknown</span>
				<span class='text'>Dates proposed in scholarly literature diverge widely, between the 18th and the 6th centuries BCE</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;&quot;Controversy over Zaraϑuštra's date has been an embarrassment of long standing to Zoroastrian studies</span>

				<span class='text'>quot; (''[[Encyclopedia Iranica]]'')&lt;/ref&gt;Older scholarship, and more recent work which uncritically incorporates it, placed Zarathushtra as living in western Iran anywhere between 625 and 550 BCE, simply using the chronology maintained by the Parsi community in India or found in very late Zoroastrian sources, composed long after the period of revelation itself,&lt;ref&gt;Cross, F</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; ignoring the textual evidence from the ''Gathas'', the oldest part of the ''Avesta'', as well as its content</span>
				<span class='text'>These deal heavily with the concerns of a pastoral steppe people living at a time when [[Bronze Age]] developments were adversely affecting their way of life</span>
				<span class='text'>Recalling this context places Zarathushtra properly into the religious dispute seen in both the ''Avesta'' and the ''Rig Veda'', which led to a decisive split between the Aryan-Vedic peoples of northern India and the Aryan-Avestan peoples of Iran</span>
				<span class='text'>lassical writers such as [[Plutarch]] and [[Diogenes Laërtius|Diogenes]] proposed dates prior to 600 BCE</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Nigosian&quot;/&gt; Until the late 17th century, Zoroaster was generally dated to about the 6th century BCE, which coincided with both the &quot;Traditional date&quot; (see details below) and historiographic accounts ([[Ammianus Marcellinus]] xxiii</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>2, 4th century CE)</span>
				<span class='text'>However, already at the time (late 19th century), the issue was far from settled</span>
				<span class='text'>he &quot;Traditional date&quot; originates in the period immediately following [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquest of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] in 330 BCE</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Nigosian/&gt; The Seleucid kings who gained power following Alexander's death instituted an &quot;Age of Alexander&quot; as the new calendrical epoch</span>
				<span class='text'>This did not appeal to the Zoroastrian priesthood who then attempted to establish an &quot;Age of Zoroaster&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>To do so, they needed to establish when Zoroaster had lived, which they accomplished by counting back the length of successive generations&lt;ref name=&quot;Shahbazi_1977_25_26&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Shahbazi|1977|pp=25–26}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; until they concluded that Zoroaster must have lived &quot;258 years before Alexander&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>This estimate then re-appeared in the 9th- to 12th-century texts of Zoroastrian tradition,{{Ref label|258Masudi|c|none}} which in turn gave the date doctrinal legitimacy, especially since it was made plausible also by the [[Pleiades#Observational history|observational history of the Pleiades]] in the [[Geoponica]] that indicates Zoroaster as a principal source of some observations</span>
				<span class='text'> In the early part of the 20th century, this remained the accepted date (subject to the uncertainties of the 'Age of Alexander'{{Ref label|258precision|d|none}}) for a number of reputable scholars, among them [[Hasan Taqizadeh]], a recognized authority on the various Iranian calendars, and hence became the date cited by Henning and others</span>
				<span class='text'>y the late 19th century, scholars such as [[Christian Bartholomae]] and Arthur Emanuel Christensen noted problems with the &quot;Traditional date&quot;, namely in the linguistic difficulties that it presented</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Avestan language|Old Avestan language]] of the Gathas (which are attributed to the founder himself) is still very close to the [[Vedic Sanskrit|Sanskrit]] of the [[Rigveda]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Therefore, it seemed implausible that the Gathas and Rigveda could be more than a few centuries apart, suggesting a date for the oldest surviving portions of the [[Avesta]] of roughly the 2nd millennium BCE</span>
				<span class='text'>A date of 11th or 10th century BCE is sometimes considered among Iranists, who in recent decades found that the social customs described in the Gathas roughly coincide with what is known of other pre-historical peoples of that period</span>
				<span class='text'>The Gathas describe a society of bipartite (priests and herdsmen/farmers) nomadic [[pastoralism|pastoralists]] with tribal structures organized at most as small kingdoms</span>
				<span class='text'>This contrasts sharply with the view of Zoroaster having lived in an empire, at which time society is attested to have had a tripartite structure (nobility/soldiers, priests, and farmers)</span>
				<span class='text'>Although a slightly earlier date (by a century or two) has been proposed on the grounds that the texts do not reflect the migration onto the [[Iranian Plateau]], it is also possible that Zoroaster lived in one of the rural societies that remained in Central Asia</span>

				<span class='text'>Coming from a reputed scholar of religions, this was a serious blow for the various regions who all claimed that Zoroaster originated from ''their'' homelands, some of which then decided that Zoroaster must then have then been buried in their regions or composed his Gathas there or preached there</span>

				<span class='text'>The 11th-century Cordoban [[Ibn Hazm]] (Zahiri school) contends that ''Kitabi'' &quot;of the Book&quot; cannot apply in light of the Zoroastrian assertion that their books were destroyed by Alexander</span>
				<span class='text'>--&gt;Citing the authority of the 8th-century [[Hisham Ibn Al-Kalbi|al-Kalbi]], the 9th- and 10th-century Sunni historian [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]] (i</span>

				<span class='text'>According to this tale, Zaradusht defrauded his master, who cursed him, causing him to become leprous (cf</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Elisha]]'s servant [[Gehazi]] in Jewish Scripture)</span>
				<span class='text'>The apostate Zaradusht then eventually made his way to Balkh (present day Afghanistan) where he converted Bishtasb (i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>[[Vishtaspa]]), who in turn compelled his subjects to adopt the religion of the Magians&lt;!--Madjusya--&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'>Recalling other tradition, al-Tabari (i</span>
				<span class='text'>81–683&lt;ref name=&quot;apud_Büchner_1936_105&quot;/&gt;) recounts that Zaradusht accompanied a Jewish prophet to Bishtasb/Vishtaspa</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon their arrival, Zaradusht translated the sage's Hebrew teachings for the king and so convinced him to convert (Tabari also notes that they had previously been [[Sabians|''Sabi''s]]) to the Magian religion</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;apud_Büchner_1936_105&quot;/&gt;The 12th-century heresiographer [[al-Shahrastani]] describes the Majusiya into three sects, the ''Kayumarthiya''&lt;!--(an otherwise undocumented sect that&amp;nbsp;– per Sharastani&amp;nbsp;– seems to have had a stronger doctrine of Ahriman's &quot;non-reality&quot;)--&gt;, the ''[[Zurvanism|Zurwaniya]]'' and the ''Zaradushtiya'', among which Al-Shahrastani asserts that only the last of the three were properly followers of Zoroaster</span>
				<span class='text'>As regards the recognition of a prophet, the Zoroaster has said: &quot;They ask you as to how should they recognize a prophet and believe him to be true in what he says; tell them what he knows the others do not, and he shall tell you even what lies hidden in your nature; he shall be able to tell you whatever you ask him and he shall perform such things which others cannot perform</span>

				<span class='text'>50–54) Shortly before the advent of the prophet of Islam, [Muhammad], Persia was under the sovereignty of Sasan V</span>
				<span class='text'>When the companions of the Prophet, on invading Persia, came in contact with the Zoroastrian people and learned these teachings, they at once came to the conclusion that Zoroaster was really a Divinely inspired prophet</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus they accorded the [[Persecution of Zoroastrians|same treatment]] to the Zoroastrian people which they did to other &quot;People of the Book&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Though the name of Zoroaster is not mentioned in the Qur'an, still he was regarded as one of those prophets whose names have not been mentioned in the Qur'an, for there is a verse in the Qur'an: &quot;And We did send apostles before thee: there are some of them that We have mentioned to thee and there are others whom We have not mentioned to Thee</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; (40 : 78)</span>
				<span class='text'>Accordingly, the Muslims treated the founder of Zoroastrianism as a true prophet and believed in his religion as they did in other inspired creeds, and thus according to the prophecy, protected the Zoroastrian religion</span>
				<span class='text'>James Darmestar remarked in the translation of [[Zend Avesta]]: &quot;When Islam assimilated the Zoroastrians to the People of the Book, it evinced a rare historical sense and solved the problem of the origin of the Avesta</span>

				<span class='text'>He often is seen holding a ''[[barsom|baresman]]'' (Avestan; [[Middle Persian]] ''barsom''), which is generally considered to be another symbol of priesthood, or with a book in hand, which may be interpreted to be the [[Avesta]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Deriving from that image, and reinforcing it, was a &quot;mass of literature&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Beck_491&quot;/&gt; attributed to him and that circulated the [[Mediterranean]] world from the 3rd century BCE to the end of antiquity and beyond</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;The Greeks considered the best wisdom to be exotic wisdom&quot; and &quot;what better and more convenient authority than the distant—temporally and geographically—Zoroaster?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beck|2003|loc=para</span>
				<span class='text'>4}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The language of that literature was predominantly [[Greek language|Greek]], though at one stage or another various parts of it passed through [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], [[Syriac]], [[coptic language|Coptic]] or [[Latin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Its ethos and cultural matrix was likewise Hellenistic, and &quot;the ascription of literature to sources beyond that political, cultural and temporal framework represents a bid for authority and a fount of legitimizing &quot;alien wisdom&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Zoroaster and the magi did not compose it, but their names sanctioned it</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Beck_491&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Beck|1991|p=491}}</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Once the magi were associated with magic in Greek imagination, Zoroaster was bound to metamorphose into a magician too</span>
				<span class='text'>The 1st-century [[Pliny the Elder]] names Zoroaster as the inventor of magic (''[[Pliny's Natural History|Natural History]]'' 30</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>)</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;However, a principle of the division of labor appears to have spared Zoroaster most of the responsibility for introducing the dark arts to the Greek and Roman worlds</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; That &quot;dubious honor&quot; went to the &quot;fabulous magus, [[Ostanes]], to whom most of the pseudepigraphic magical literature was attributed</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;Beck_2003_para7&quot;/&gt; Moreover, the little &quot;magical&quot; teaching that is ascribed to Zoroaster is actually very late, with the very earliest example being from the 14th century</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beck|1991|p=522}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;One factor for the association with astrology was Zoroaster's name, or rather, what the Greeks made of it</span>
				<span class='text'>Within the scheme of Greek thinking (which was always on the lookout for hidden significances and &quot;real&quot; meanings of words) his name was identified at first with star-worshiping (''astrothytes'' &quot;star sacrificer&quot;) and, with the ''Zo-'', even as the ''living'' star</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;!-- Beck 523 --&gt; Later, an even more elaborate mythoetymology evolved: Zoroaster died by the living (''zo-'') flux (''-ro-'') of fire from the star (''-astr-'') which he himself had invoked, and even, that the stars killed him in revenge for having been restrained by him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;!-- Beck 523 --&gt;Similar ideas about Zoroaster also appear in early Christian literature, beginning with the ''[[Clementine literature|Clementine Homilies]]'' 9</span>
				<span class='text'>–5, which identifies him with a parallel series of traditions about [[Nimrod]] having been the founder of astrology</span>
				<span class='text'>In this account, Nimrod is killed by lightning and posthumously deified by the Persians as &quot;Zoroaster, on account of the living (''zosan'') stream of the star (''asteros'') being poured upon him</span>

				<span class='text'>5), which—so Cumont and Bidez—derived from a Semitic form of his name</span>

				<span class='text'>Pliny's 2nd- or 3rd-century attribution of &quot;two million lines&quot; to Zoroaster suggest that (even if exaggeration and duplicates are taken into consideration) a formidable pseudepigraphic corpus once existed at the [[Library of Alexandria]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This corpus can safely be assumed to be pseudepigrapha because no one before Pliny refers to literature by &quot;Zoroaster&quot;,&lt;ref name = &quot;Beck_526&quot;/&gt; and on the authority of the 2nd-century [[Galen|Galen of Pergamon]] and from a 6th-century commentator on Aristotle it is known that the acquisition policies of well-endowed royal libraries created a market for fabricating manuscripts of famous and ancient authors</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;!-- &quot;This, says Galen, was the origin of much of the spurious literature still in circulation in his day</span>
				<span class='text'>It cannot of course be proved, but it seems not unlikely that Zoroaster, bearing as fabled and antique a name as one might wish, and moreover never having written any real books against which to test the false, would have been an ideal author for the inventions of these entrepreneurs of the book trade</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Among the named works attributed to &quot;Zoroaster&quot; is a treatise ''On Nature'' (''Peri physeos''), which appears to have originally constituted four volumes (i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>papyrus rolls)</span>
				<span class='text'>The framework is a retelling of Plato's ''[[Myth of Er]]'', with Zoroaster taking the place of the original hero</span>
				<span class='text'>While Porphyry imagined [[Pythagoras]] listening to Zoroaster's discourse, ''On Nature'' has the sun in middle position, which was how it was understood in the 3rd century</span>
				<span class='text'>In contrast, Plato's 4th-century BCE version had the sun in second place above the moon</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; With respect to substance and content in ''On Nature'' only two facts are known:&lt;!-- 530 --&gt; that it was crammed with astrological speculations, and that [[Ananke (mythology)|Necessity (''Ananké'')]] was mentioned by name and that she was in the air</span>
				<span class='text'>nother work circulating under the name of &quot;Zoroaster&quot; was the ''Asteroskopita'' (or  ''Apotelesmatika''), and which ran to five volumes (i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>papyrus rolls)</span>
				<span class='text'>The title and fragments suggest that it was an astrological handbook, &quot;albeit a very varied one, for the making of predictions</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Beck 1991 p=493&quot;/&gt; A third text attributed to Zoroaster is ''On Virtue of Stones'' (''Peri lithon timion''), of which nothing is known other than its extent (one volume) and that pseudo-Zoroaster ''sang'' it (from which Cumont and Bidez conclude that it was in verse)</span>
				<span class='text'>Numerous other fragments (preserved in the works of other authors) are attributed to &quot;Zoroaster,&quot; but the titles of whose books are not mentioned</span>
				<span class='text'>hese pseudepigraphic texts aside, some authors did draw on a few genuinely Zoroastrian ideas</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''Oracles of Hystaspes'', by &quot;[[Vishtaspa|Hystaspes]]&quot;, another prominent magian pseudo-author, is a set of prophecies distinguished from other Zoroastrian pseudepigrapha in that it draws on real Zoroastrian sources</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Beck 1991 p=493&quot;/&gt; Some allusions are more difficult to assess: in the same text that attributes the invention of magic to Zoroaster, Pliny states that Zoroaster laughed on the day of his birth, although in an earlier place (VII, I), Pliny had sworn in the name of [[Hercules]] that no child had ever done so before the 40th day from his birth</span>
				<span class='text'>This notion of Zoroaster's laughter (like that of &quot;two million verses&quot;) also appears in the 9th– to 11th-century texts of genuine Zoroastrian tradition,  and for a time it was assumed that the origin of those myths lay with indigenous sources</span>
				<span class='text'>Pliny also records (VII, XV) that Zoroaster's head had pulsated so strongly that it repelled the hand when laid upon it, a presage of his future wisdom</span>
				<span class='text'>The Iranians were however just as familiar with the Greek writers</span>
				<span class='text'>The provenance of other descriptions are clear, so for instance, Plutarch's description of its dualistic theologies: &quot;Others call the better of these a god and his rival a daemon, as, for example, Zoroaster the Magus, who lived, so they record, five thousand years before the siege of Troy</span>
				<span class='text'>He used to call the one [[Ahura Mazda|Horomazes]] and the other [[Angra Mainyu|Areimanius]]&quot; (''Isis and Osiris'' 46-7)</span>
