				<span class='text'>]When Humayun came to the throne several of his brothers revolted against him</span>
				<span class='text'>Another brother Khalil Mirza (1509–30) supported Humayun but was assassinated</span>
				<span class='text'>The Emperor commenced construction of a tomb for his brother in 1540 but this was uncompleted when Humayun was forced to flee to Persia</span>
				<span class='text'>Sher Shah destroyed the structure and no further work was done on it after Humayun's restoration</span>
				<span class='text'>umayun had two major rivals for his lands — [[Sultan Bahadur]] of Gujarat to the south west and Sher Shah Suri (Sher Khan) settled along the [[river Ganges]] in [[Bihar]] to the east</span>
				<span class='text'>Humayun’s first campaign was to confront Sher Khan Suri</span>
				<span class='text'>Halfway through this offensive Humayun had to abandon it and concentrate on Gujarat, where a threat from Ahmed Shah had to be met</span>
				<span class='text'>Humayun was victorious annexing [[Gujarat]], [[Malwa]], [[Champaner]] and the great fort of [[Mandu, Madhya Pradesh|Mandu]]</span>
				<span class='text'>uring the first five years of Humayun's reign, Bahadur and Sher Khan extended their rule, although Sultan Bahadur faced pressure in the east from sporadic conflicts with the [[Portugal|Portuguese]]</span>
				<span class='text'>While the Mughals had obtained firearms via the [[Ottoman Empire]], Bahadur's Gujarat had acquired them through a series of contracts drawn up with the Portuguese, allowing the Portuguese to establish a strategic foothold in north western India</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;Multiple2&quot;/&gt;Humayun was made aware that the Sultan of Gujarat was planning an assault on the Mughal territories with Portuguese aid</span>

				<span class='text'>He began to gather his army together hoping for a rapid and decisive siege of the Mughal capital</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon hearing this alarming news, Humayun quickly marched his troops back to Agra allowing Bahadur to easily regain control of the territories Humayun had recently taken</span>
				<span class='text'>A few months later, however, Bahadur was dead, killed when a botched plan to kidnap the Portuguese viceroy ended in a fire-fight which the Sultan lost</span>
				<span class='text'>hilst Humayun succeeded in protecting Agra from Sher Shah, the second city of the Empire, [[Gaur, West Bengal|Gaur]] the capital of the ''vilayat'' of Bengal, was sacked</span>
				<span class='text'>Humayun's troops had been delayed while trying to take [[Chunar]], a fort occupied by Sher Shah's son, in order to protect his troops from an attack from the rear</span>

				<span class='text'>When Humayun sent the grand ''Mufti'', Sheikh Buhlul, to reason with him, the Sheikh was killed</span>
				<span class='text'>Further provoking the rebellion, Hindal ordered that the ''Khutba'' or sermon in the main mosque at Agra be read in his name, a sign of assumption of sovereignty</span>

				<span class='text'>This was to become an entrenched battle in which both sides spent a lot of time digging themselves into positions</span>
				<span class='text'>The major part of the Mughal army, the artillery, was now immobile, and Humayun decided to engage in some diplomacy using Muhammad Aziz as ambassador</span>
				<span class='text'>Humayun agreed to allow Sher Shah to rule over Bengal and Bihar, but only as provinces granted to him by his Emperor, Humayun, falling short of outright sovereignty</span>
				<span class='text'>The two rulers also struck a bargain in order to save face: Humayun's troops would charge those of Sher Shah whose forces then retreat in feigned fear</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Once the Army of Humayun had made its charge and Sher Shah's troops made their agreed-upon retreat, the Mughal troops relaxed their defensive preparations and returned to their entrenchments without posting a proper guard</span>
				<span class='text'>Observing the Mughals' vulnerability, Sher Shah reneged on his earlier agreement</span>
				<span class='text'>That very night, his army approached the Mughal camp and finding the Mughal troops unprepared with a majority asleep, they advanced and killed most of them</span>

				<span class='text'>-&gt; With his armies travelling at a leisurely pace, Sher Shah was gradually drawing closer and closer to Agra</span>
				<span class='text'>This was a serious threat to the entire family, but Humayun and Kamran squabbled over how to proceed</span>
				<span class='text'>Kamran withdrew after Humayun refused to make a quick attack on the approaching enemy, instead opting to build a larger army under his own name</span>
				<span class='text'>hen Kamran returned to [[Lahore]], his troops followed him shortly afterwards, and Humayun, with his other brothers Askari and Hindal, marched to meet Sher Shah just {{convert|240|km|mi}} east of Agra at the '''''Battle of Kanauj''''' on 17 May 1540</span>
				<span class='text'>The battle once again saw Humayun make some tactical errors, and his army was soundly defeated</span>
				<span class='text'>He and his brothers quickly retreated back to Agra, but they chose not to stay in Agra, and retreated to Lahore, since Sher Shah followed them</span>
				<span class='text'> The founding of the short-lived [[Sur Dynasty]] (which contained only him and his son)of northern India with its capital at [[Delhi]], resulted in Humayun's exile for 15 years in the court of [[Shah Tahmasp I]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Sher Shah dismissed his help, believing it not to be required, though word soon spread to Lahore about the treacherous proposal and Humayun was urged to make an example of Kamran and kill him</span>

				<span class='text'>In many accounts Humayun mentions how he and his pregnant wife, had to trace their steps through the desert at the hottest time of year</span>
				<span class='text'>All the wells had been filled with sand by the nearby [[Hindu]] inhabitants in order to starve and exhaust the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]]s further, leaving them with nothing but berries to eat</span>
				<span class='text'>When Hamida's horse died, no one would lend the Queen (who was now eight months pregnant) a horse, so Humayun did so himself, resulting in him riding a camel for six kilometeres (four miles), although Khaled Beg then offered him his mount</span>
				<span class='text'>Humayun was later to describe this incident as the lowest point in his life</span>
				<span class='text'>e asked that his brothers join him as he fell back into [[Sindh]]</span>
				<span class='text'>While the previously rebellious Hindal Mirza remained loyal and was ordered to join his brothers in [[Kandahar]]</span>

				<span class='text'>This was to be a definitive schism in the family</span>

				<span class='text'>The Emir Hussein Umrani welcomed Humayun's presence and was loyal to Humayun just as he had been loyal to [[Babur]] against the renegade [[Arghun]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>Whilst in the [[oasis]] garrison of [[Umerkot]] in [[Sindh]], Hamida daughter of noble Sindhi, gave birth to [[Akbar]] on 15 October 1542, the heir-apparent to the 34-year-old Humayun</span>
				<span class='text'>The date was special because Humayun consulted his Astronomer to utilize the [[astrolabe]] and check the location of the planets</span>
				<span class='text'>hile in Sindh, Humayun alongside Emir Hussein Umrani, gathered horses and weapons and formed new alliances that helped regain lost territories</span>
				<span class='text'>Until finally Humayun had gathered hundreds of [[Sindhis|Sindhi]] and [[Baloch people|Baloch]] tribesmen alongside his [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]]s and then marched towards [[Kandahar]] and later [[Kabul]], thousands more gathered by his side as Humayun continually declared himself the rightful [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] heir of the first [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Babur]]</span>

				<span class='text'>]Humayun fled to the refuge of the [[Safavid Empire]] in Persia, marching with 40 men and his wife and her companion through mountains and valleys</span>
				<span class='text'>Amongst other trials the Imperial party were forced to live on horse meat boiled in the soldiers' helmets</span>
				<span class='text'>These indignities continued during the month it took them to reach [[Herat]], however after their arrival they were reintroduced to the finer things in life</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon entering  the city his army was greeted with an armed escort, and they were treated to lavish food and clothing</span>
				<span class='text'>They were given fine accommodations and the roads were cleared and cleaned before them</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Tahmasp I|Shah Tahmasp]], unlike Humayun's own family, actually welcomed the Mughal, and treated him as a royal visitor</span>
				<span class='text'>Here Humayun went sightseeing and was amazed at the Persian artwork and architecture he saw: much of this was the work of the Timurid Sultan [[Husayn Bayqarah]] and his ancestor, princess [[Gauhar Shad]], thus he was able to admire the work of his relatives and ancestors at first hand</span>
				<span class='text'>e was introduced to the work of the Persian miniaturists, and [[Kamaleddin Behzad]] had two of his pupils join Humayun in his court</span>
				<span class='text'>Humayun was amazed at their work and asked if they would work for him if he were to regain the sovereignty of Hindustan: they agreed</span>
				<span class='text'>With so much going on Humayun did not even meet the Shah until July, some six months after his arrival in Persia</span>
				<span class='text'>After a lengthy journey from Herat the two met in [[Qazvin (city)|Qazvin]] where a large feast and parties were held for the event</span>
				<span class='text'>The meeting of the two monarchs is depicted in a famous wall-painting in the [[Chehel Sotoun]] (Forty Columns) palace in [[Isfahan (city)|Esfahan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>he Shah urged that Humayun convert from [[Sunni]] to [[Shia Islam]], and Humayun eventually and reluctantly accepted, in order to keep himself and several hundred followers alive</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]]s initially disagreed to their conversion they knew that with this outward acceptance of Shi'ism, [[Tahmasp I|Shah Tahmasp]] was eventually prepared to offer Humayun more substantial support</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Richards|1993|p=11|ps=: &quot;At the Safavid court, Humayun, under extreme duress, accepted the Shia faith in order to keep himself and several hundred followers alive</span>
				<span class='text'>After this initial test, Shah Tahmasp grew more friendly and eventually agreed to underwrite Humayun's attempt to regain power</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;}} When Humayun's brother, Kamran Mirza, offered to cede [[Kandahar]] to the Persians in exchange for Humayun, dead or alive, [[Tahmasp I|Shah Tahmasp]] refused</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead the Shah staged a celebration for Humayun, with 300 tents, an imperial Persian carpet, 12 musical bands and &quot;meat of all kinds&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Here the Shah announced that all this, and 12,000 elite cavalry{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} were his to lead an attack on his brother Kamran</span>
				<span class='text'>All that [[Tahmasp I|Shah Tahmasp]] asked for was that, if Humayun's forces were victorious, Kandahar would be his</span>

				<span class='text'>In the end, there was no actual siege</span>
				<span class='text'>Kamran Mirza was detested as a leader and as Humayun's Persian army approached the city hundreds of Kamran Mirza's troops changed sides, flocking to join Humayun and swelling his ranks</span>
				<span class='text'>Kamran Mirza absconded and began building an army outside the city</span>

				<span class='text'>owever, while Humayun had a larger army than his brother and had the upper hand, on two occasions his poor military judgement allowed Kamran Mirza to retake Kabul and Kandahar, forcing Humayun to mount further campaigns for their recapture</span>
				<span class='text'>He may have been aided in this by his reputation for leniency towards the troops who had defended the cities against him, as opposed to Kamran Mirza, whose brief periods of possession were marked by atrocities against the inhabitants who, he supposed, had helped his brother</span>

				<span class='text'>He was allowed go on [[Hajj]], and died en route in the desert outside [[Damascus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>umayun's other brother, Kamran Mirza, had repeatedly sought to have Humayun killed</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1552 Kamran Mirza attempted to make a pact with [[Islam Shah]], [[Sher Shah Suri|Sher Shah's]] successor, but was apprehended by a [[Gakhars|Gakhar]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Gakhars were one of the minority of tribal groups who had consistently remained loyal to their oath to the Mughals</span>
				<span class='text'>Sultan Adam of the Gakhars handed Kamran Mirza over to Humayun</span>
				<span class='text'>Humayun was inclined to forgive his brother</span>
				<span class='text'>However he was warned that allowing Kamran Mirza's repeated acts of treachery to go unpunished could foment rebellion amongst his own supporters</span>
				<span class='text'>So, instead of killing his brother, Humayun had Kamran Mirza blinded which would end any claim by the latter to the throne</span>
				<span class='text'>Humayun sent Kamran Mirza on [[Hajj]], as he hoped to see his brother thereby absolved of his offences</span>
				<span class='text'>However Kamran Mirza died close to [[Mecca]] in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] in 1557</span>
