				<span class='text'>vg}}'''Zhou Enlai''' ({{zh|s=周恩来|t=周恩來|p=Zhōu Ēnlái|w=Chou En-lai}}) [[IPA]]: {{IPAc-cmn|zh|ou|1|-|en|1|l|ai|2}} (5 March 1898 – 8 January 1976) was the first [[Premier of the People's Republic of China]], serving from October 1949 until his death in January 1976</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou served under [[Mao Zedong]] and was instrumental in consolidating the control of the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]]'s rise to power, forming foreign policy, and developing the [[Economy of China|Chinese economy]]</span>
				<span class='text'> skilled and able diplomat, Zhou served as the Chinese [[Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China|foreign minister]] from 1949 to 1958</span>
				<span class='text'>Advocating [[peaceful coexistence]] with the West after the stalemated [[Korean War]], he participated in the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|1954 Geneva Conference]], the 1955 [[Bandung Conference]], and helped orchestrate [[1972 Nixon visit to China|Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He helped devise policies regarding the bitter disputes with the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> Taiwan, the Soviet Union (after 1960), India and Vietnam</span>
				<span class='text'>hou survived the purges of other top officials during the [[Cultural Revolution]]</span>
				<span class='text'>With Mao dedicating most of his later years to political struggle and ideological work, Zhou was the main driving force behind the affairs of state during much of the Cultural Revolution</span>
				<span class='text'>His attempts at mitigating the [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]]' damage and his efforts to protect others from their wrath made him immensely popular in the Cultural Revolution's later stages</span>
				<span class='text'>s Mao Zedong's health began to decline in 1971 and 1972, Zhou and the [[Gang of Four]] struggled internally over leadership of China</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou's health was also failing, however, and he died eight months before Mao on 8 January 1976</span>
				<span class='text'>The massive public outpouring of grief in Beijing turned to anger towards the Gang of Four, leading to the [[Tiananmen Incident]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Although succeeded by [[Hua Guofeng]], it was [[Deng Xiaoping]], Zhou's ally, who was able to outmaneuver the Gang of Four politically and eventually take Mao's place as [[Paramount leader]] by 1978</span>
				<span class='text'>=Early life=====Youth===Zhou Enlai was born in [[Huai'an]], [[Jiangsu]] province on 5 March 1898, the first son of his branch of the Zhou family</span>
				<span class='text'>The Zhou family were originally from [[Shaoxing]] in [[Zhejiang]] province</span>
				<span class='text'>During the late [[Qing dynasty]], Shaoxing was famous as the home of families such as Zhou's, whose members worked as government &quot;clerks&quot; (师爷, shiye) generation after generation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lee 7&lt;/ref&gt; To move up the ladder in civil service, the men in these families often had to get transferred, and in the late years of the Qing dynasty, Zhou Enlai's branch of the family moved to Huai'an</span>
				<span class='text'>Even after the move, however, the family continued to view Shaoxing as its ancestral home</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lee 6&lt;/ref&gt;Zhou's grandfather, [[Zhou Panlong]], and his granduncle, Zhou Jun'ang, were the first members of the family to move to Huai'an</span>
				<span class='text'>Panlong apparently passed the provincial examinations, and Zhou Enlai later claimed that Panlong served as magistrate governing Huai'an county</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lee (180 n7) cites a recent study that claims Zhou Panlong did not actually serve as county magistrate</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Zhou's father, Zhou Yineng, was the second of Zhou Panlong's four sons</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou's birth mother, surnamed Wan, was the daughter of a prominent Jiangsu official</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;During the Cultural Revolution, when &quot;red&quot; (poor) family background became essential for everything from college admission to government service, Zhou had to go back to his mother's mother whom he claimed was a farmer's daughter, to find a family member who qualified as &quot;red&quot; (Barnouin and Yu 11)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Like many others, the economic fortunes of Zhou's large family of scholar-officials were decimated by a great economic recession that China suffered in the late 19th century</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Zhou Yineng]] had a reputation for honesty, gentleness, intelligence and concern for others, but was also considered &quot;weak&quot; and &quot;lacking in discipline and determination&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He was unsuccessful in his personal life, and drifted across China doing various occupations, working in [[Beijing]], [[Shandong]], [[Anhui]], [[Shenyang]], [[Inner Mongolia]] and [[Sichuan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou Enlai later remembered his father as being always away from home and generally unable to support his family</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 9&lt;/ref&gt;Soon after birth, Zhou Enlai was adopted by his father's youngest brother, Zhou Yigan, who was ill with tuberculosis</span>
				<span class='text'> Apparently the adoption was arranged because the family feared Yigan would die without an heir</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;This is the reason for the adoption given in Gao (23)</span>
				<span class='text'>Lee (11) suggests that it was due to the belief that having a son could cure a father's illness</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Zhou Yigan died soon after the adoption, and Zhou Enlai was raised by Yigan's widow, whose surname was Chen</span>
				<span class='text'>Madame Chen was also from a scholarly family and received a traditional literary education</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Zhou's own account, he was very close to his adoptive mother and acquired his lasting interest in Chinese literature and opera from her</span>
				<span class='text'>Madame Chen taught Zhou to read and write at an early age, and Zhou later claimed to have read the famous vernacular novel ''[[Journey to the West]]'' at the age of six</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lee 17, 21&lt;/ref&gt;  By the age of eight, he was reading other traditional Chinese novels, including ''the [[Water Margin]]'', ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'', and ''[[Dream of the Red Mansion]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 11&lt;/ref&gt;Zhou's birth mother Wan died in 1907 when Zhou was 9, and his adoptive mother Chen in 1908 when Zhou was 10</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou's father was working in Hubei, far from Jiangsu, so Zhou and his two younger brothers returned to Huai'an and lived with his father's remaining younger brother Yikui for the next two years</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lee 16–17&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910, Zhou's uncle Yigeng, his father's older brother, offered to care for Zhou</span>
				<span class='text'>The family in Huai'an agreed, and Zhou was sent to stay with his uncle in Manchuria at [[Shenyang]], where Zhou Yigeng worked in a government office</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Zhou's father may have also been in Manchuria at this time, and Zhou may have lived with him for a while</span>
				<span class='text'>Afterwards Zhou's contacts with his father diminished</span>
				<span class='text'>He died in 1941</span>
				<span class='text'>See Lee 19–21 for a discussion of Zhou's relationship with his father</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Education===In [[Shenyang]], Zhou attended the Dongguan Model Academy, a modern-style school</span>
				<span class='text'>His previous education consisted entirely of homeschooling</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition to new subjects such as English and science, Zhou was also exposed to the writings of reformers and radicals such as [[Liang Qichao]], [[Kang Youwei]], [[Chen Tianhua]], [[Zou Rong]] and [[Zhang Binglin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lee 25–26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 13–14&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of fourteen, Zhou declared that his motivation for pursuing education was to &quot;become a great man who will take up the heavy responsibilities of the country in the future</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 14&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, Zhou's uncle was transferred to Tianjin, where Zhou entered the famous [[Tianjin Nankai High School|Nankai Middle School]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ankai Middle School was founded by [[Yan Xiu]], a prominent scholar and philanthropist, and headed by [[Zhang Boling]], one of the most important Chinese educators of the 20th century</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Boorman &quot;Chang Po-ling&quot; (101) calls him &quot;one of the founders of modern education in China&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Nankai's teaching methods were unusual by contemporary Chinese standards</span>
				<span class='text'>By the time Zhou began attending, it had adopted the educational model used at the [[Phillips Academy]] in the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lee 39, 46&lt;/ref&gt; The school's reputation, with its &quot;highly disciplined&quot; daily routine and &quot;strict moral code&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Lee 43&lt;/ref&gt; attracted many students who later became prominent in public life</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou's friends and classmates there ranged from [[Ma Jun (20th century Chinese communist leader)|Ma Jun]] (an early communist leader executed in 1927) to [[Wu Guozhen|K</span>
				<span class='text'>C</span>
				<span class='text'>Wu]] (later mayor of Shanghai and governor of Taiwan under the Nationalist party)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lee 55 and 44&lt;/ref&gt; Zhou's talents also attracted the attention of Yan Xiu and Zhang Boling</span>
				<span class='text'>Yan in particular thought highly of Zhou, helping to pay for his studies in Japan and later France</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lee 77 and 152&lt;/ref&gt;Yan was so impressed with Zhou that he encouraged Zhou to marry his daughter, but Zhou declined</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou later expressed the reasons for his decision not to marry Yan's daughter to his classmate, [[Zhang Honghao]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou said that he declined the marriage because he feared that his financial prospects would not be promising, and that Yan would, as his father-in-law, later dominate his life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 16&lt;/ref&gt;Zhou did well in his studies at Nankai; he excelled in Chinese, won several awards in the school speech club, and became editor of the school newspaper in his final year</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou was also very active in acting and producing dramas and plays at Nankai; many students who were not otherwise acquainted with him knew of him through his acting</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lee 64–66&lt;/ref&gt; Nankai preserves a number of essays and articles written by Zhou at this time, and these reflect the discipline, training, and concern for country that Nankai's founders attempted to instill in their students</span>
				<span class='text'> At the school's tenth commencement in June 1917, Zhou was one of five graduating students honored at the ceremony, and one of the two valedictorians</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lee 74&lt;/ref&gt;By the time that he graduated from Nankai, Zhang Boling's teachings of ''gong'' (public spirit) and ''neng'' (ability) had made a great impression on him</span>
				<span class='text'>His participation in debates and stage performances contributed to his eloquence and skills of persuasion</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou left Nankai with a great desire to pursue public service, and to acquire the skills required to do so</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 18&lt;/ref&gt;Following many of his classmates, Zhou went to Japan in July 1917 for further studies</span>
				<span class='text'>During his two years in Japan, Zhou spent most of his time in the East Asian Higher Preparatory School, a language school for Chinese students</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou's studies were supported by his uncles, and apparently Nankai founder Yan Xiu as well, but their funds were limited and during this period Japan suffered from severe inflation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lee 86 103&lt;/ref&gt; Zhou originally planned on winning one of the scholarships offered by the Chinese government; these scholarships, however, required Chinese students to pass entrance examinations in Japanese universities</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou took entrance examinations for at least two schools, but failed to gain admission</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lee 89&lt;/ref&gt; Zhou's reported anxieties were compounded by the death of his uncle, [[Zhou Yikui]], an inability to master Japanese, and an acute Japanese cultural chauvinism that discriminated against Chinese</span>
				<span class='text'>By the time that Zhou returned to China in the spring of 1919, he had become deeply disenchanted with Japanese culture, rejecting the idea that the Japanese political model was relevant to China and disdaining the values of elitism and militarism that he observed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 29–30&lt;/ref&gt;Zhou's diaries and letters from his time in Tokyo show a deep interest in politics and current events, in particular, the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the Bolsheviks' new policies</span>
				<span class='text'>He began to read avidly [[Chen Duxiu]]'s progressive and left-leaning magazine, ''New Youth''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 21&lt;/ref&gt; He probably read some early Japanese works on Marx, and it has been claimed that he even attended [[Kawakami Hajime]]'s lectures at Kyoto University</span>
				<span class='text'>Kawakami was an important figure in the early history of Japanese Marxism, and his translations and articles influenced a generation of Chinese communists</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Boorman (332) makes the claim that Zhou attended Kawakami's lectures&lt;/ref&gt; However, it now seems unlikely that Zhou met him or heard any of his lectures</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lee 104&lt;/ref&gt; Zhou's diaries also show his concern over Chinese student strikes in Japan in May 1918, when the Chinese government failed to send the students' scholarships, but he apparently was not deeply involved in the protest</span>
				<span class='text'>His active role in political movements began after his return to China</span>
				<span class='text'>==Early political activities===[[File:Premier Zhou 1919</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|A young Zhou Enlai (1919)]]Zhou returned to Tianjin sometime in the spring of 1919</span>
				<span class='text'>Historians disagree over Zhou's participation in the [[May Fourth Movement]] (May to June 1919)</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou's &quot;official&quot; Chinese biography states that he was a leader of the Tianjin student protests in the May Fourth movement,&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnouin and Yu 22&quot;&gt;Barnouin and Yu 22&lt;/ref&gt; but many modern scholars believe that it is highly unlikely that Zhou participated at all, based on the total lack of direct evidence among the surviving records from the period</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Barnouin and Yu 22&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee 118–119&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1919, however, Zhou became editor of the Tianjin Student Union Bulletin, apparently at the request of his Nankai classmate, [[Ma Jun (20th century Chinese communist leader)|Ma Jun]], a founder of the Union</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lee 125&lt;/ref&gt; During its brief existence from July 1919 to early 1920, the Bulletin was widely read by student groups around the country and suppressed on at least one occasion by the national government as &quot;harmful to public safety and social order</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lee 127–8&lt;/ref&gt;When [[Nankai University|Nankai became a university]] in August 1919, Zhou was in the first class but he was an activist full-time</span>
				<span class='text'>His political activities continued to expand; and, in September, he and several other students agreed to establish the &quot;Awakening Society&quot;, a small group never numbering more than 25</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lee 133</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In explaining the goals and purpose of the Awakening Society, Zhou declared that &quot;anything that is incompatible with progress in current times, such as militarism, the bourgeoisie, partylords, bureaucrats, inequality between men and women, obstinate ideas, obsolete morals, old ethics</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>should be abolished or reformed&quot;, and affirmed that it was the purpose of the Society to spread this awareness among the Chinese people</span>
				<span class='text'> It was in this society that Zhou first met his future wife, [[Deng Yingchao]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 23&lt;/ref&gt;  In some ways, the Awakening Society resembled the clandestine Marxist study group at [[Peking University]] headed by [[Li Dazhao]], with the group members using numbers instead of names for &quot;secrecy&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>(Zhou was &quot;Number Five&quot;, a pseudonym which he continued to use in later years</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;ref&gt;Lee 137&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, immediately after the group was established, it invited Li Dazhao to give a lecture on Marxism</span>
				<span class='text'>hou assumed more prominent active role in political activities over the next few months</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lee 138&lt;/ref&gt; The largest of these activities were rallies in support of a nationwide boycott of Japanese goods</span>
				<span class='text'>As the boycott became more effective, the national government, under pressure from Japan, attempted to suppress it</span>
				<span class='text'>On 23 January 1920, a confrontation over boycott activities in Tianjin led to the arrest of a number of people, including several Awakening Society members, and on 29 January Zhou led a march on the Governor's Office in Tianjin to present a petition calling for the arrestees' release</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou and three other leaders were themselves arrested</span>
				<span class='text'>The arrestees were held for over six months; during their detention, Zhou supposedly organized discussions on Marxism</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lee 139&lt;/ref&gt; At their trial in July, Zhou and six others were sentenced to two months; the rest were found not guilty</span>
				<span class='text'>All were immediately released since they had already been held over six months</span>
				<span class='text'>fter Zhou's release, he and the Awakening Society met with several Beijing organizations and agreed to form a &quot;Reform Federation&quot;; during these activities Zhou became more familiar with Li Dazhao and met Zhang Shenfu, who was the contact between Li in Beijing and [[Chen Duxiu]] in Shanghai</span>
				<span class='text'>Both men were organizing underground Communist cells in cooperation with [[Grigori Voitinsky]], a Comintern agent, but Zhou apparently did not meet Voitinsky at this point</span>
				<span class='text'>oon after his release, Zhou decided to go to Europe to study</span>
				<span class='text'>(He was expelled from Nankai University during his detention</span>
				<span class='text'> Although money was a problem, he received a scholarship from [[Yan Xiu]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lee 152&lt;/ref&gt; In order to gain greater funding, he successfully approached a Tianjin newspaper, ''Yishi bao'', for work as a &quot;special correspondent&quot; in Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou left Shanghai for Europe on 7 November 1920 with a group of 196 work study students, including friends from Nankai and Tianjin</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Twentyfive1&quot;&gt;Barnouin and Yu 25&lt;/ref&gt;Zhou's experiences after the May Fourth incident seem to have been crucial in his radicalization</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou's friends in the Awakening Society were similarly affected</span>
				<span class='text'>15 of the group's members became Communists for at least some time, and the group remained close later on</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou and six other group members wound up going to Europe in the next two years, and Zhou eventually married the group's youngest member, [[Deng Yingchao]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==European activities===Zhou's group arrived in [[Marseille]] on 13 December 1920</span>
				<span class='text'> Unlike most other Chinese students, who traveled to Europe on work-study programs, Zhou's scholarship and position with ''Yishi bao'' meant that he was well provided for and did not have to do any work during his stay</span>
				<span class='text'>Because of his financial position, he was able to devote himself full-time to revolutionary activities</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Twentyfive1&quot; /&gt; In a letter to his cousin in 30 January 1921, Zhou said that his goals in Europe were to discover the social conditions in foreign countries and their methods of resolving social issues, for the purpose of later applying these lessons to China after his return</span>
				<span class='text'>In the same letter he told his cousin that, regarding his adoption of a specific ideology, &quot;I still have to make up my mind</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;twentysix1&quot;&gt;Barnouin and Yu 26&lt;/ref&gt;While in Europe, Zhou, also named as John Knight, studied the differing approaches to resolving class conflict adopted by various European nations</span>
				<span class='text'>In London on January 1921, Zhou witnessed a large miners' strike and wrote a series of articles for the ''Yishi bao'' (generally sympathetic to the miners) examining the conflict between workers and employers, and the conflict's resolution</span>
				<span class='text'> After five weeks in London he moved to Paris, where interest in Russia's 1917 [[October Revolution]] was high</span>
				<span class='text'>In a letter to his cousin, Zhou identified two broad paths of reform for China: &quot;gradual reform&quot; (as in England) or &quot;violent means&quot; (as in Russia)</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou wrote that &quot;I do not have a preference for either the Russian or the British way</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>I would prefer something in-between, rather than one of these two extremes&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;twentysix1&quot; /&gt;Still interested in academic programs, Zhou traveled to Britain in January 1921 to visit [[Edinburgh University]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Concerned by financial problems and language requirements, he did not enroll, returning to France at the end of January</span>
				<span class='text'>There are no records of Zhou entering any academic program in France</span>
				<span class='text'>In spring 1921, he joined a Chinese Communist cell</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;The date of this has been controversial</span>
				<span class='text'>Most writers, such as Gao (41), now accept March 1921</span>
				<span class='text'>Several of these cells were established in late 1920 and early 1921</span>
				<span class='text'>The cells were organized before the Chinese Communist Party was established in July 1921, so there is some controversy over the membership status of cell members</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Zhou was recruited by [[Zhang Shenfu]], whom he had met in August of the previous year in connection with [[Li Dazhao]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also knew Zhang through Zhang's wife, [[Liu Qingyang]], a member of the Awakening Society</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou has sometimes been portrayed at this time as uncertain in his politics,&lt;ref&gt;Gao 40, Levine 150&lt;/ref&gt; but his swift move to Communism suggests otherwise</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;In addition to noting the uncertain status of cell members versus party members, Levine (151 n47) questions whether Zhou was at this point a &quot;stalwart&quot; Communist in his beliefs</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The cell Zhou belonged to was based in Paris;&lt;ref&gt;Goebel, [http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>1-2</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; in addition to Zhou, Zhang, and Liu it included two other students, Zhao Shiyan and Chen Gongpei</span>
				<span class='text'>Over the next several months, this group eventually formed a united organization with a group of Chinese radicals from Hunan, who were living in Montargis south of Paris</span>
				<span class='text'>This group included such later prominent figures as [[Cai Hesen]], [[Li Lisan]], Chen Yi, [[Nie Rongzhen]], [[Deng Xiaoping]] and also Guo Longzhen, another member of the Awakening Society</span>
				<span class='text'>Unlike Zhou, most of the students in this group were participants in the work-study program</span>
				<span class='text'>A series of conflicts with the Chinese administrators of the program over low pay and poor working conditions resulted in over a hundred students occupying the program's offices at the Sino-French Institute in Lyon in September 1921</span>
				<span class='text'>The students, including several people from the Montargis group, were arrested and deported</span>
				<span class='text'> Zhou was apparently not one of the occupying students and remained in France until February or March 1922, when he moved with Zhang and Liu from Paris to Berlin</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou's move to Berlin was perhaps because the relatively &quot;lenient&quot; political atmosphere in Berlin made it more favorable as a base for overall European organizing</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lee 159&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Western European Secretariat of the [[Comintern]] was located in Berlin and it is clear that Zhou had important Comintern connections, though the nature of these is disputed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Levine 169–172&lt;/ref&gt;  After moving operations to Germany, Zhou regularly shuttled between Paris and Berlin</span>
				<span class='text'>hou returned to Paris by June 1922, where he was one of the twenty two participants present at the organization of the [[Chinese Youth Communist Party]], established as the European Branch of the Chinese Communist Party</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;This description is based on Lee 161</span>
				<span class='text'>Other sources give varying dates, places, and numbers of people</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Zhou helped draft the party's charter and was elected to the three member executive committee as director of propaganda</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 27&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote for and helped edit the party magazine, ''Shaonian'' (Youth), later renamed ''Chiguang'' (Red Light)</span>
				<span class='text'>It was in Zhou's capacity as general editor of this magazine that Zhou first met [[Deng Xiaoping]], only seventeen years old, whom Zhou hired to operate a mimeograph (copy) machine</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 28&lt;/ref&gt; The party went through several reorganizations and name changes, but Zhou remained a key member of the group throughout his stay in Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>Other important activities Zhou undertook included recruiting and transporting students for the [[Communist University of the Toilers of the East|University of the Toilers of the East]] in Moscow, and the establishment of the Chinese Nationalist Party ([[Kuomintang]] or KMT) European branch</span>
				<span class='text'>n June 1923, the Third Congress of the Chinese Communist Party accepted the Comintern's instructions to ally with the KMT, led at the time by [[Sun Yat-sen]]</span>
				<span class='text'>These instructions called for CCP members to join the Nationalist Party as &quot;individuals&quot;, while still retaining their association with the CCP</span>
				<span class='text'>After joining the CCP, they would work to lead and direct it, transforming it into a vehicle of revolution</span>
				<span class='text'>Within several years, this strategy would become the source of serious conflict between the KMT and the CCP</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 31&lt;/ref&gt;Zhou not only joined the KMT, but actually helped organize the founding of the Nationalist Party European branch in November 1923</span>
				<span class='text'>Under Zhou's influence, most of the European branch's officers were in fact communists</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou's wide ranging contacts and personal relationships formed during this period were central to his career</span>
				<span class='text'>Important party leaders, such as [[Zhu De]] and [[Nie Rongzhen]], were first admitted to the party by Zhou</span>
				<span class='text'>y 1924, the Soviet-Nationalist alliance was expanding rapidly and Zhou was summoned back to China for further work</span>
				<span class='text'>He left Europe probably in late July 1924,&lt;ref&gt;Lee cites Zhou's last public activity in Europe as a Nationalist party farewell dinner on 24 July</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; returning to China as one of the most senior Chinese Communist Party members in Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>=Political and military work in Whampoa==[[File:1924 Zhou Enlai in National Revolutionary Army uniform2</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|In [[Whampoa Military Academy]] as Director of the political department]]===Establishment in Guangzhou===Zhou returned to China in late August or early September 1924 to join the Political Department of the [[Whampoa Military Academy]], probably through the influence of Zhang Shenfu, who had previously worked there</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lee 165&lt;/ref&gt; The exact positions Zhou held at Whampoa and the dates he held them are not clear</span>
				<span class='text'>A few months after his arrival, possibly October 1924, he became deputy director of the Academy's Political Department, and later, possibly November 1924, director of the department</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;The conflicting evidence on Zhou's positions at Whampoa is summarized in Wilbur, ''Missionaries'' 196 n7</span>
				<span class='text'> Another point of confusion is that Chou was later head of the Political Training Department</span>
				<span class='text'>This was technically not part of Whampoa, but was a unit of the central government, responsible directly to the National Government Military Council (Wilbur, ''Revolution'' 33)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Even though it was technically responsible to the central government, Zhou's political department operated under a direct mandate to indoctrinate Whampoa's cadets in the ideology of the KMT for the purpose of improving loyalty and morale</span>
				<span class='text'>While he was serving in Whampoa, Zhou was also made the secretary of the Communist Party of Guandong-Guanxi, and served as the CCP representative with the rank of major-general</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 32&lt;/ref&gt;The island of Whampoa, ten miles downriver from Guangzhou, was at the heart of the Soviet-Nationalist Party alliance</span>
				<span class='text'> Conceived as the training center of the Nationalist Party Army, it was to provide the military base from which the Nationalists would launch their campaign to unify China, which was split into dozens of military satrapies</span>
				<span class='text'>From its beginning, the school was funded, armed, and partly staffed by the Soviets</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wilbur, ''Nationalist'' 13–14&lt;/ref&gt;The Political Department, where Zhou worked, was responsible for political indoctrination and control</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, Zhou was a prominent figure at most Academy meetings, often addressing the school immediately after commandant [[Chiang Kai-shek]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was extremely influential in establishing the political department/party representative (commissar) system which was adopted in Nationalist armed forces in 1925</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wilbur, ''Missionaries'' 238&lt;/ref&gt;Concurrent with his Whampoa appointment, Zhou became secretary of the Communist Party's Guangdong Provincial Committee, and at some point a member of the Provincial Committee's Military Section</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;&quot;Secretary of provincial committee&quot; is according to Barnouin and Yu, 32</span>
				<span class='text'>Other works give different dates and positions</span>
				<span class='text'>His work in the Provincial Military Section probably came a little later, see Barnouin and Yu 35</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Zhou vigorously extended Communist influence at the Academy</span>
				<span class='text'>He soon arranged for a number of other prominent Communists to join the Political Department, including [[Chen Yi (communist)|Chen Yi]], [[Nie Rongzhen]], [[Yun Daiying]] and [[Xiong Xiong]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;For Chen Yi, see Boorman, &quot;Chen Yi&quot;, 255</span>
				<span class='text'>For the rest, see Weidenbaum 212–213&lt;/ref&gt; Zhou played an important role in establishing the Young Soldiers Association, a youth group which was dominated by the Communists, and Sparks, a short-lived Communist front group</span>
				<span class='text'>He thus recruited numerous new Communist party members from cadet ranks, and eventually set up a covert Communist Party branch at the academy to direct the new members</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Barnouin and Yu 35&quot;&gt;Barnouin and Yu 35&lt;/ref&gt; When Nationalists concerned with the increasing number of Communist members and organizations at Whampoa set up a &quot;Society for [[Sun Yat-sen]]ism&quot;, Zhou attempted to squelch it; the conflict between these student groups set the background for Zhou's removal from the academy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hsu 47–48&lt;/ref&gt;===Military activities===Zhou participated in two military operations conducted by the Nationalist regime in 1925, later known as the first and second Eastern Expeditions</span>
				<span class='text'>The first was in January 1925 when [[Chen Jiongming]], an important Cantonese military leader previously driven out of Guangzhou by Sun Yat-sen, attempted to retake Guangzhou</span>
				<span class='text'>The Nationalist regime's campaign against Chen consisted of forces from the Guangdong Army under [[Xu Chongzhi]], and two training regiments of the Nationalist Party Army, led by Chiang Kai-shek and staffed by Academy officers and cadets</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wilbur ''Nationalist'' 20</span>
				<span class='text'>As Wilbur notes, Russian advisors played important roles in these early campaigns</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The fighting lasted through May 1925, with the defeat, but not destruction, of Chen's forces</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Boorman &quot;Ch'en Chiung-ming&quot; 179&lt;/ref&gt; Zhou accompanied the Whampoa cadets on the expedition as a political officer</span>
				<span class='text'>hen Chen regrouped and attacked Guangzhou again in September 1925, the Nationalists launched a second expedition</span>
				<span class='text'> Nationalist forces by this time had been reorganized into five corps (or armies), and adopted the commissar system with Political Departments and Nationalist party representatives in most divisions</span>
				<span class='text'>The First Corps, made up of the Nationalist Party Army, was led by Whampoa graduates and commanded by Chiang Kai-shek, who personally appointed Zhou director of the First Corps Political Department</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wilbur ''Missionaries'' 203 n92&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, the Nationalist Party's Central Executive Committee appointed Zhou Nationalist Party party representative, making Zhou chief commissar of the First Corps</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wilbur ''Missionaries'' 175&lt;/ref&gt; The first major battle of expedition saw the capture of Chen's base in Huizhou on 15 October</span>
				<span class='text'>Shantou was taken on 6 November, and by the end of 1925, the Nationalists controlled all of Guangdong province</span>
				<span class='text'>hou's appointment as chief commissar of the First Corps allowed him to appoint Communists as commissars in four of the Corps' five divisions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wilbur ''Missionaries'' 222&lt;/ref&gt; Following the conclusion of the Expedition, Zhou was appointed special commissioner for the East River District, which placed him in temporary administrative control of several counties; he apparently used this opportunity to establish a Communist party branch in Shantou and strengthen the CPC's control of local unions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Weidenbaum 233–235&lt;/ref&gt; This marked the high point of Zhou's time at Whampoa</span>
				<span class='text'>==Political activities===In personal terms, 1925 was also an important year for Zhou</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou had kept in touch with [[Deng Yingchao]], whom he had met in the Awakening Society while in Tianjin; and, in January 1925, Zhou asked for and received permission from CCP authorities to marry Deng</span>
				<span class='text'>The two married in Guangzhou on 8 August 1925</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu, 33–34&lt;/ref&gt;Zhou's work at Whampoa came to an end with the [[Zhongshan Warship Incident]] of 20 March 1926, in which a gunboat with a mostly Communist crew moved from Whampoa to Guangzhou without Chiang's knowledge or approval</span>
				<span class='text'>This event led to Chiang's exclusion of Communists from the Academy by May 1926, and the removal of numerous Communists from high positions in the Nationalist Party</span>
				<span class='text'>In his memoirs, [[Nie Rongzhen]] suggested that the gunboat had moved in protest of Zhou Enlai's (brief) arrest</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Barnouin and Yu 35&quot;/&gt;Zhou's time in Whampoa was a significant period in his career</span>
				<span class='text'>His pioneering work as a political officer in the military made him an important Communist Party expert in this key area; much of his later career centered on the military</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou's work in the CCP Guangdong Regional Committee Military Section was typical of his covert activities in the period</span>
				<span class='text'>The Section was a secret group consisting of three members of the Provincial Central Committee, and was first responsible for organizing and directing CCP nuclei in the army itself</span>
				<span class='text'>These nuclei, organized at the regimental level and above, were &quot;illegal&quot;, meaning they were formed without Nationalist knowledge or authorization</span>
				<span class='text'>The Section was also responsible for organizing similar nuclei in other armed groups, including secret societies and key services such as railroads and waterways</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou did extensive work in these areas until the final separation of the Nationalist and Communist parties and the end of the Soviet-Nationalist alliance in 1927</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wilbur ''Missionaries'' 244 has a detailed discussion of the section</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Nationalist-Communist split=====Extent of cooperation===Zhou's activities immediately after his removal from his positions at Whampoa are uncertain</span>
				<span class='text'>An earlier biographer claims that Chiang Kai-shek put Zhou in charge of &quot;an advanced training center for the CCP members and commissars withdrawn from the army&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hsu 53&lt;/ref&gt; More recent Chinese Communist sources claim that Zhou had an important role at this time in securing Communist control of [[Ye Ting]]'s Independent Regiment</span>
				<span class='text'>The regiment and Ye Ting later played a leading role in the Communists' first major military action, the [[Nanchang Uprising|Nanchang Revolt]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Barnouin and Yu 35&quot;/&gt;In July 1926, the Nationalists began the [[Northern Expedition]], a massive military attempt to unify China</span>
				<span class='text'>The Expedition was led by [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and the [[National Revolutionary Army]] (NRA), an amalgam of earlier military forces with significant guidance from Russian military advisors and numerous Communists as both commanding and political officers</span>
				<span class='text'>With the early successes of the Expedition, there was soon a race between Chiang Kai-shek leading the &quot;right-wing&quot; of the Nationalist Party and the Communists, running inside the &quot;left-wing&quot; of the Nationalists, for control of major southern cities such as Nanjing and Shanghai</span>
				<span class='text'>At this point the Chinese portion of Shanghai was controlled by [[Sun Chuanfang]], one of the militarists targeted by the North Expedition</span>
				<span class='text'>Distracted by fighting with the NRA and defections from his army, Sun reduced his forces in Shanghai, and the Communists, whose party headquarters was located in Shanghai, made three attempts to seize control of the city, later called &quot;the three Shanghai Uprisings&quot;, in October 1926, February 1927, and March 1927</span>
				<span class='text'>==Activities in Shanghai===Zhou was transferred to Shanghai to assist in these activities, probably in late 1926</span>
				<span class='text'>It seems he was not present for the first uprising on 23–24 October,&lt;ref&gt;Hsu 55–56&lt;/ref&gt; but he was certainly in Shanghai by December 1926</span>
				<span class='text'>Early accounts credit Zhou with labor organizing activities in Shanghai after his arrival, or, more credibly, working to &quot;strengthen the indoctrination of political workers in labor unions and smuggle arms for the strikers</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hsu 56&lt;/ref&gt; Reports that Zhou &quot;organized&quot; or &quot;ordered&quot; the second and third uprisings on 20 February and 21 March exaggerate his role</span>
				<span class='text'>Major decisions during this period were made by the Communist head in Shanghai, [[Chen Duxiu]], the Party's general secretary, with a special committee of eight party officials coordinating Communist actions</span>
				<span class='text'>The committee also consulted closely on decisions with the Comintern representatives in Shanghai, headed by [[Grigori Voitinsky]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Smith 228&lt;/ref&gt; The partial documentation available for this period shows that Zhou headed the Communist Party Central Committee's Military Commission in Shanghai</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Smith 226&lt;/ref&gt; He participated in both the February and March actions, but was not the guiding hand in either event, instead working with A</span>
				<span class='text'>P</span>
				<span class='text'>Appen, the Soviet military advisor to the Central Committee, training the pickets of the General Labor Union, the Communist controlled labor organization in Shanghai</span>
				<span class='text'>He also worked to make union strong arm squads more effective when the Communists declared a &quot;Red Terror&quot; after the failed February uprising; this action resulted in the murder of twenty &quot;anti-union&quot; figures, and the kidnapping, beating, and intimidation of others associated with anti-union activities</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Smith 227&lt;/ref&gt;The third Communist uprising in Shanghai took place from 20–21 March</span>
				<span class='text'>600,000 rioting workers cut power and telephone lines and seized the city's post office, police headquarters, and railway stations, often after heavy fighting</span>
				<span class='text'>During this uprising, the insurrectionists were under strict orders not to harm foreigners, which they obeyed</span>
				<span class='text'>The forces of [[Sun Chuanfang]] withdrew and uprising was successful, despite the small number of armed forces available</span>
				<span class='text'>The first Nationalist troops entered the city the next day</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Spence 335&lt;/ref&gt;As the Communists attempted to install a soviet municipal government, conflict began between the Nationalists and Communists, and on 12 April Nationalist forces, including both members of the [[Green Gang]] and soldiers under the command of Nationalist general [[Bai Chongxi]] attacked the Communists and quickly overcame them</span>
				<span class='text'> On the eve of the Nationalist attack, [[Wang Shouhua]], who was both the head of the CCP Labour Committee and the Chairman of the General Labour Committee, accepted a dinner invitation from [[Du Yuesheng|&quot;Big-eared Du&quot;]] (a Shanghai gangster) and was strangled after he arrived</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou himself was nearly killed in a similar trap, when he was arrested after arriving at a dinner held at the headquarters of Si Lie, a Nationalist commander of Chiang's Twenty-sixth Army</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite rumors that Chiang had put a high price on Zhou's head, he was quickly released by [[Bai Chongxi]]'s forces</span>
				<span class='text'>The reasons for Zhou's sudden release may have been that Zhou was then the most senior Communist in Shanghai, that Chiang's efforts to exterminate the Shanghai Communists were highly secretive at the time, and that his execution would have been noticed as a violation of the cooperation agreement between the CCP and the KMT (which was technically still in effect)</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou was finally only released after the intervention of a representative of the Twenty-sixth Army, Zhao Shu, who was able to convince his commanders that the arrest of Zhou had been a mistake</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 37&lt;/ref&gt;===Flight from Shanghai===Fleeing Shanghai, Zhou made his way to [[Hankou]] (now part of [[Wuhan]]), and was a participant at the CCP's 5th National Congress there from 27 April to 9 May</span>
				<span class='text'>At the end of the Congress, Zhou was elected to the Party's Central Committee, again heading the military department</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hsu 58&lt;/ref&gt; After Chiang Kai-shek's suppression of the Communists, the Nationalist Party split in two, with the Nationalist Party's &quot;left-wing&quot; (led by [[Wang Jingwei]]) controlling the government in Hankou, and Chiang and the party &quot;right-wing&quot; (led by Chiang Kai-shek) establishing a rival government in Nanjing</span>
				<span class='text'>Still following Comintern instructions, the Communists remained as a &quot;bloc inside&quot; the Nationalist Party, hoping to continue expanding their influence through the Nationalists</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Hsu61&quot;&gt;Hsu 61–64&lt;/ref&gt; After being attacked by a warlord friendly to Chiang, Wang's leftist government disintegrated later in May 1927, and Chiang's troops began an organized purge of Communists in territories formerly controlled by Wang</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnoun and Yu 38&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-July Zhou was forced to go underground</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Hsu61&quot; /&gt;Pressured by their Comintern advisors, and themselves convinced that the &quot;revolutionary high tide&quot; had arrived, the Communists decided to launch a series of military revolts</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hsu 64&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these was the [[Nanchang Uprising|Nanchang Revolt]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou was sent to oversee the event, but the moving figures seem to have been [[Tan Pingshan]] and [[Li Lisan]], while the main military figures were [[Ye Ting]] and [[He Long]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In military terms, the revolt was a disaster, with the Communists' forces decimated and scattered</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wilbur&lt;/ref&gt;Zhou himself contracted malaria during the campaign, and was secretly sent to Hong Kong for medical treatment by [[Nie Rongzhen]] and Ye Ting</span>
				<span class='text'>After reaching Hong Kong, Zhou was disguised as a businessman named &quot;Li&quot;, and entrusted to the care of local Communists</span>
				<span class='text'>In a subsequent meeting of the CCP Central Committee, Zhou was blamed for the failure of the Nanchang campaign and temporarily demoted to being an alternate member of the Politburo</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 40–41&lt;/ref&gt;==Activities during the Chinese Civil War=====The Sixth Party Congress===After the failure of the Nanchang Uprising, Zhou left China for the Soviet Union to attend the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) Sixth National Party Congress in Moscow, in June–July 1928</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Whitson and Huang 39–40&lt;/ref&gt; The Sixth Congress had to be held in Moscow because conditions in China were considered dangerous</span>
				<span class='text'>KMT control was so tight that many Chinese delegates attending the Sixth Congress were forced to travel in disguise: Zhou himself was disguised as an antiquarian</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Barnouin and Yu 42&quot;&gt;Barnouin and Yu 42&lt;/ref&gt;At the Sixth Congress, Zhou delivered a long speech insisting that conditions in China were not favorable for immediate revolution, and that the main task of the CCP should be to develop revolutionary momentum by winning over the support of the masses in the countryside and establishing a Soviet regime in southern China, similar to the one that [[Mao Zedong]] and Zhu De were already establishing around Jiangxi</span>
				<span class='text'>The Congress generally accepted Zhou's assessment as accurate</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Xiang Zhongfa]] was made secretary general of the Party, but was soon found incapable of fulfilling his role, so Zhou emerged as the ''de facto'' leader of the CCP</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou was only thirty years old</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Barnouin and Yu 42&quot;/&gt;During the Sixth Congress, Zhou was elected Director of the Central Committee Organization Department</span>
				<span class='text'>His ally, Li Lisan, took over propaganda work</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou finally returned to China, after more than a year abroad, in 1929</span>
				<span class='text'> At the Sixth Congress in Moscow, Zhou had given figures indicating that, by 1928, fewer than 32,000 union members remained who were loyal to the Communists, and that only ten percent of Party members were proletarians</span>
				<span class='text'>By 1929, only three percent of the Party were proletarians</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Spence 386&lt;/ref&gt;In early 1930, Zhou began to disagree with the timing of Li Lisan's strategy of favoring rich peasants and concentrating military forces for attacks on urban centers</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou did not openly break with these more orthodox notions, and even tried to implement them later, in 1931, in Jiangxi</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Whitson and Huang 40&lt;/ref&gt; When the Soviet agent [[Pavel Mif]] arrived in Shanghai to lead the Comintern in China in December 1930, Mif criticized Li's strategy as &quot;left adventurism&quot;, and criticized Zhou for compromising with Li</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou &quot;acknowledged&quot; his mistakes in compromising with Li in January 1931 and offered to resign from the Politburo, but was retained while other senior CCP leaders, including Li Lisan and Qu Qiubai, were removed</span>
				<span class='text'> Like Mao later recognized, Mif understood that Zhou's services as Party leader were indispensable, and that Zhou would willingly cooperate with whoever was holding power</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 44&lt;/ref&gt;===Underground work: establishment===[[File:Gu Soonzhang</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|200px|[[Gu Shunzhang]], the number two man of the Chinese communist espionage network, whose defection dealt a serious blow to the communist movement</span>
				<span class='text'>]After arriving back in Shanghai in 1929, Zhou began to work underground, establishing and overseeing a network of independent Communist cells</span>
				<span class='text'> Zhou's greatest danger in his underground work was the threat of being discovered by the KMT secret police, which had been established in 1928 with the specific mission of identifying and eliminating Communists</span>
				<span class='text'>In order to avoid detection, Zhou and his wife changed residences at least once a month, and used a variety of aliases</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou often disguised himself as a businessman, sometimes wearing a beard</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou was careful that only two or three people ever knew his whereabouts</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou disguised all urban Party offices, made sure that CCP offices never shared the same buildings when in the same city, and required all Party members to use passwords to identify one another</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou restricted all of his meetings to either before 7AM or after 7PM</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou never used public transportation, and avoided being seen in public places</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 44–45&lt;/ref&gt;In November 1928, the CCP also established its own intelligence agency (the &quot;Special Service section of the Central Committee&quot;, or ''&quot;Zhongyang Teke&quot;'' (Chinese:中央特科), often abbreviated as ''&quot;Teke&quot;''), which Zhou subsequently came to control</span>
				<span class='text'> Zhou's chief lieutenants were [[Gu Shunzhang]], who had strong ties to Chinese secret societies and became an alternate member of the Politburo, and [[Xiang Zhongfa]]</span>
				<span class='text'>''Teke'' had four operational sections: one for the protection and safety of Party members; one for intelligence gathering; one for facilitating internal communications; and, one to conduct assassinations, a team that became known as the &quot;Red Squad&quot; (红队)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 45&lt;/ref&gt;Zhou's main concern in running ''Teke'' was to establish an effective anti-espionage network within the KMT secret police</span>
				<span class='text'> Within a short amount of time the head of ''Teke'''s intelligence section, [[Chen Geng]], succeeded in planting a large network of moles inside the Investigation Section of the Central Operations Department in Nanjing, which was the center of KMT intelligence</span>
				<span class='text'> The three most successful agents used by Zhou to infiltrate the KMT secret police were [[Qian Zhuangfei]], [[Li Kenong]], and [[Hu Di]], who Zhou referred to as &quot;the three most distinguished intelligence workers of the Party&quot; in the 1930s</span>
				<span class='text'>Agents planted within various KMT offices were later critical in the survival of the CCP, helping the Party escape Chiang's [[Encirclement Campaigns]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 45–46&lt;/ref&gt;===KMT response to Zhou's intelligence work===In late April 1931 Zhou's chief aide in security affairs, [[Gu Shunzhang]], was arrested by the KMT in Wuhan</span>
				<span class='text'>Gu was a former labour organizer with strong mafia connections and weak commitments to the CCP</span>
				<span class='text'>Under threat of heavy torture, Gu gave the KMT secret police detailed accounts of underground CCP organizations in Wuhan, leading to the arrest and executions of over ten senior CCP leaders in the city</span>
				<span class='text'>Gu offered to provide the KMT with details of CCP activities in Shanghai, but only if he could give the information directly to Chiang Kai-shek</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 46&lt;/ref&gt;One of Zhou's agents working in Nanjing, Qian Zhuangfei, intercepted a telegram requesting further instructions from Nanjing on how to proceed, and abandoned his cover to personally warn Zhou of the impending crackdown</span>
				<span class='text'>The two days before Gu arrived in Nanjing to meet with Chiang gave Zhou time to evacuate Party members and to change the communication codes used by ''Teke'', all of which were known to Gu</span>
				<span class='text'>After meeting briefly with Chiang in Nanjing, Gu arrived in Shanghai and assisted the KMT secret police in raiding CCP offices and residences, capturing members who could not be evacuated in time</span>
				<span class='text'>The summary executions of those suspected of Communist sympathies resulted in the largest death-toll since the [[Shanghai massacre of 1927]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 47&lt;/ref&gt;Zhou's reaction to Gu's betrayal was extreme</span>
				<span class='text'> More than fifteen members of Gu's family, some of whom worked for ''Teke'', were murdered by the Red Squad and buried in quiet residential areas of Shanghai</span>
				<span class='text'>The Red Squad then assassinated Wang Bing, a leading member of the KMT secret police who was known for moving around Shanghai in rickshaws, without the protection of bodyguards</span>
				<span class='text'>Most surviving CCP members were relocated to the Communist base in Jiangxi</span>
				<span class='text'>Because most senior staff had become exposed by Gu, most of its best agents were also relocated</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou's most senior aide not yet under suspicion, [[Pan Hannian]], became ''Teke'''s director</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 47–48&lt;/ref&gt;The night before he was scheduled to leave Shanghai in June 1931, [[Xiang Zhongfa]], who was one of Zhou's most senior agents, decided to spend the night in a hotel with his mistress, ignoring Zhou's warnings about the danger</span>
				<span class='text'>In the morning, a KMT informant who had been trailing Xiang spotted him as he was leaving the hotel</span>
				<span class='text'>Xiang was immediately arrested and imprisoned within the [[French Concession]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou attempted to prevent Xiang's expected extradition to KMT-controlled China by having his agents bribe the chief of police in the French Concession, but the KMT authorities appealed directly to the authorities of the French Concession, ensuring that the chief of police could not intervene</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou's hopes that Xiang would be transferred to Nanjing, giving him an opportunity to kidnap Xiang, also came to naught</span>
				<span class='text'>The French agreed to transfer Xiang to the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, under the command of General [[Xiong Shihui]], who subjected Xiang to relentless torture and interrogation</span>
				<span class='text'>Once he became convinced that Xiang had given his torturers all the information that they requested, Chiang Kai-shek ordered Xiang to be executed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;BY48&quot;&gt;Barnouin and Yu 48&lt;/ref&gt;Zhou Enlai later succeeded in secretly purchasing a copy of Xiang's interrogation records</span>
				<span class='text'>The records showed that Xiang had disclosed everything to the KMT authorities before his execution, including the location of Zhou's residence</span>
				<span class='text'>Another round of arrests and executions followed Xiang's capture, but Zhou and his wife were able to escape capture because they had abandoned their apartment on the morning of Xiang's arrest</span>
				<span class='text'>After establishing a new Politburo Standing Committee in Shanghai, Zhou and his wife relocated to the Communist base in Jiangxi near the end of 1931</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;BY48&quot; /&gt;  By the time Zhou left Shanghai, he was one of the most wanted men in China</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 52&lt;/ref&gt;===The Jiangxi Soviet==={{Main|Jiangxi-Fujian Soviet}}Following the failed Nanchang and Autumn Harvest Uprisings of 1927, the Communists began to focus on establishing a series of rural bases of operation in southern China</span>
				<span class='text'>Even before moving to Jiangxi, Zhou had become involved in the politics of these bases</span>
				<span class='text'>Mao, claiming the need to eliminate counterrevolutionaries and Anti-Bolsheviks operating within the CCP, began an ideological purge of the populace inside the Jiangxi Soviet</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou, perhaps due to his own success planting moles within various levels of the KMT, agreed that an organized campaign to uncover subversion was justified, and supported the campaign as de facto leader of the CCP</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 49&lt;/ref&gt;Mao's efforts soon developed into a ruthless campaign driven by paranoia and aimed not only at KMT spies, but at anyone with an ideological outlook different from Mao's</span>
				<span class='text'>Suspects were commonly tortured until they confessed to their crimes and accused others of crimes, and wives and relatives who inquired of those being tortured were themselves arrested and tortured even more severely</span>
				<span class='text'>Mao's attempts to purge the Red Army of those who might potentially oppose him led Mao to accuse [[Chen Yi (communist)|Chen Yi]], the commander and political commissar of the Jiangxi Military Region, as a counterrevolutionary, provoking a violent reaction against Mao's persecutions that became known as the &quot;Futian Incident&quot; in January 1931</span>
				<span class='text'>Mao was eventually successful in subduing the Red Army, reducing its numbers from forty thousand to less than ten thousand</span>
				<span class='text'>The campaign continued throughout 1930 and 1931</span>
				<span class='text'>Historians estimate the total number who died due to Mao's persecution in all base areas to be approximately one hundred thousand</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 49–51&lt;/ref&gt;The entire campaign occurred while Zhou was still in Shanghai</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he had supported the elimination of counterrevolutionaries, Zhou actively suppressed the campaign when he arrived in Jiangxi in December 1931, criticizing the &quot;excess, the panic, and the oversimplification&quot; practiced by local officials</span>
				<span class='text'>After investigating those accused of Anti-Bolshevism, and those persecuting them, Zhou submitted a report criticizing the campaign for focusing on the narrow persecution of anti-Maoists as anti-Bolshevists, exaggerating the threat to the Party, and condemning the use of torture as an investigative technique</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou's resolution was passed and adopted on 7 January 1932, and the campaign gradually subsided</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 51–52&lt;/ref&gt;Zhou moved to the [[Jiangxi]] base area and shook up the propaganda-oriented approach to revolution by demanding that the armed forces under Communist control actually be used to expand the base, rather than just to control and defend it</span>
				<span class='text'>In December 1931, Zhou replaced [[Mao Zedong]] as Secretary of the First Front Army with [[Xiang Ying]], and made himself political commissar of the Red Army, in place of Mao</span>
				<span class='text'>Liu Bocheng, Lin Biao and [[Peng Dehuai]] all criticized Mao's tactics at the October 1932 [[Ningdu Conference]]</span>

				<span class='text'>In the Ningdu conference, Mao was demoted to being a figurehead in the Soviet government</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou, who had come to appreciate Mao's strategies after the series of military failures waged by other Party leaders since 1927, defended Mao, but was unsuccessful</span>
				<span class='text'>After achieving power, Mao later purged or demoted those who had opposed him in 1932, but remembered Zhou's defense of his policies</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 52–55&lt;/ref&gt;===Chiang's Encirclement Campaigns==={{main|Encirclement Campaigns}}In early 1933, [[Bo Gu]] arrived with the German Comintern adviser [[Otto Braun (Li De)]] and took control of party affairs</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou at this time, apparently with strong support from Party and military colleagues, reorganized and standardized the Red Army</span>
				<span class='text'>Under Zhou, Bo, and Braun, the Red Army defeated [[Encirclement Campaigns|four attacks]] by Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist troops</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wilson 51&lt;/ref&gt; The military structure that led the Communists to victory was::{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;!Leaders!Unit Designation|-|Lin Biao, Nie Rongzhen|1st Corps|-|Peng Dehuai, Yang Shangkun|3rd Corps|-|Xiao Jinguang|7th Corps|-|Xiao Ke|8th Corps|-|Luo Binghui|9th Corps|-|Fang Zhimin|10th Corps|}Chiang's fifth campaign, launched in September 1933, was much more difficult to contain</span>
				<span class='text'>Chiang's new use of &quot;blockhouse tactics&quot; and larger numbers of troops allowed his army to advance steadily into Communist territory, and they succeeded in seizing several major Communist strongholds</span>
				<span class='text'>Bo Gu and [[Otto Braun (Li De)]] adopted orthodox tactics to respond to Chiang, and Zhou, although personally opposed to them, directed these</span>
				<span class='text'>Following their subsequent defeat, he and other military leaders were blamed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 56&lt;/ref&gt;Although Zhou's subsequently cautious military approach was distrusted by hardliners, he was again appointed to the position of vice chairman of the Military Commission</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou was accepted as leader largely because of his organizational talent and devotion to work, and because he had never shown any overt ambition to pursue supreme power within the Party</span>
				<span class='text'>Within months, the continuing orthodox tactics of Bo and Braun led to a serious defeat for the Red Army, and forced the leaders of the CCP to seriously consider abandoning their bases in Jiangxi</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 57&lt;/ref&gt;===The Long March==={{Main|Long March}}After the decision to abandon Jiangxi was announced, Zhou was placed in charge of organizing and supervising the logistics of the Communist withdrawal</span>
				<span class='text'>Making his plans in absolute secrecy and waiting till the last moment to inform even senior leaders of the group's movements, Zhou's objective was to break through the enemy encirclement with as few casualties as possible, and before Chiang's forces were able to completely occupy all Communist bases</span>
				<span class='text'>It is not known what criteria were used to determine who would stay and who would go, but 16,000 troops and some of the Communists' most notable commanders at the time (including [[Xiang Ying]], [[Chen Yi (communist)|Chen Yi]], [[Tan Zhenlin]], and [[Qu Qiubai]]) were left to form a rear guard to divert the main force of Nationalist troops from noticing the Communists' general withdrawal</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 57–58&lt;/ref&gt;The withdrawal of 84,000 soldiers and civilians began in early October, 1934</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou's intelligence agents were successful in identifying a large section of Chiang's blockhouse lines that were manned by troops under General [[Chen Jitang]], a [[Guangdong]] warlord who Zhou identified as being likely to prefer preserving the strength of his troops over fighting</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou sent [[Pan Hannian]] to negotiate for safe passage with General Chen, who subsequently allowed the Red Army to pass through the territory that he controlled without fighting</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Fiftyeight1&quot;&gt;Barnouin and Yu 58&lt;/ref&gt;After passing through three of the four blockhouse fortifications needed to escape Chiang's encirclement, the Red Army was finally intercepted by regular Nationalist troops, and suffered heavy casualties</span>
				<span class='text'>Of the 86,000 Communists who attempted to break out of Jiangxi, only 36,000 successfully escaped</span>
				<span class='text'>This loss demoralized some Communist leaders (particularly [[Bo Gu]] and Otto Braun), but Zhou remained calm and retained his command</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Fiftyeight1&quot; /&gt;During the Communists' subsequent [[Long March]], there were numerous high-level disputes over the direction that the Communists should take, and on the causes of the Red Army's defeats</span>
				<span class='text'>During the power struggles that ensued, Zhou consistently backed [[Mao Zedong]] against the interests of Bo Gu and Otto Braun</span>
				<span class='text'>Bo and Braun were later blamed for the Red Army's defeats, and were eventually removed from their positions of leadership</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 59&lt;/ref&gt; The Communists eventually succeeded in re-establishing a base in northern [[Shaanxi]] on 20 October 1935, arriving with only 8,000–9,000 remaining members</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Spence 402&lt;/ref&gt;Zhou's position within the CCP changed numerous times throughout the Long March</span>
				<span class='text'>By the early 1930s, Zhou was recognized as the ''de facto'' leader of the CCP, and exercised superior influence over other members of the CCP even when sharing power with Bo and Braun</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 49–52&lt;/ref&gt; In the months following the January 1935 [[Zunyi Conference]], in which Bo and Braun were removed from senior positions, Zhou mostly retained his position because he displayed a willingness to display responsibility, because his tactics in defeating Chiang's Fourth Encirclement Campaign were recognized as being successful, and because he supported Mao Zedong, who was gaining influence inside the Party: after the Zunyi Conference, Mao became Zhou's assistant</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 59–60&lt;/ref&gt; After the Communists reached Shaanxi and completed the Long March, Mao officially took over Zhou Enlai's leading position in the CCP, while Zhou took a secondary position as vice-Chairman</span>
				<span class='text'> Mao and Zhou would retain their positions within the CCP until their deaths in 1976</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 62&lt;/ref&gt;===The Xi'an Incident==={{Main|Xi'an Incident}}[[File:WHU-Zhou</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|250px|upright|Zhou Enlai (middle) and his wife [[Deng Yingchao]] with American journalist [[Edgar Snow]], approx</span>
				<span class='text'>1938</span>
				<span class='text'>]During the seventh congress of the [[Comintern]], held in August 1936, Wang Ming issued an anti-Fascist manifesto, indicating that the CCP's previous policy of &quot;opposing Chiang Kai-shek and resisting Japan&quot; was to be replaced by a policy of &quot;uniting with Chiang Kai-shek to resist Japan&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou was instrumental in carrying out this policy</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou made contact with one of the most senior KMT commanders in the northwest, [[Zhang Xueliang]]</span>
				<span class='text'>By 1935, Zhang was well known for his [[anti-Japanese sentiment]]s and his doubts about Chiang's willingness to oppose the Japanese</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhang's disposition made him easily influenced by Zhou's indications that the CCP would cooperate to fight against the Japanese</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 64–65)&lt;/ref&gt;Zhou established a &quot;northeast working committee&quot; for the purpose of promoting cooperation with Zhang</span>
				<span class='text'>The committee worked to persuade Zhang's Northeast Army to unite with the Red Army to fight Japan and retake [[Manchuria]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The committee also created new patriotic slogans, including &quot;Chinese must not fight Chinese&quot;, to promote Zhou's goals</span>
				<span class='text'>Using his network of secret contacts, Zhou arranged a meeting with Zhang in [[Yan'an]], then controlled by Zhang's &quot;Northeast Army&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;BY65&quot;&gt;Barnouin and Yu 65&lt;/ref&gt;The first meeting between Zhou and Zhang occurred inside a church on 7 April 1936</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhang showed a great interest in ending the civil war, uniting the country, and fighting the Japanese, but warned that Chiang was firmly in control of the national government, and that these goals would be difficult to pursue without Chiang's cooperation</span>
				<span class='text'>Both parties ended their meeting with an agreement to find a way to secretly work together</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time that Zhou was establishing secret contacts with Zhang, Chiang was growing suspicious of Zhang, and became increasingly dissatisfied with Zhang's inaction against the Communists</span>
				<span class='text'>In order to deceive Chiang, Zhou and Zhang deployed mock military units in order to give the impression that the Northeast Army and the Red Army were engaged in battle</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;BY65&quot; /&gt;In December 1936, [[Chang Kai-shek]] flew to the Nationalist headquarters in Xi'an in order to test the loyalty of local KMT military forces under Marshal Zhang Xueliang, and to personally lead these forces in a final attack on Communist bases in Shaanxi, which Zhang had been ordered to destroy</span>
				<span class='text'>Determined to force Chiang to direct China's forces against the Japanese (who had taken Zhang's territory of [[Manchuria]] and were preparing a broader invasion), on 12 December Zhang and his followers stormed Chiang's headquarters, killed most of his bodyguards, and seized the Generalissimo in what became known as the [[Xi'an Incident]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Spence 407&lt;/ref&gt;Reactions to Chiang's kidnapping in [[Yan'an]] were mixed</span>
				<span class='text'>Some, including [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Zhu De]], viewed it as an opportunity to have Chiang killed</span>
				<span class='text'>Others, including Zhou Enlai and [[Zhang Wentian]], saw it as an opportunity to achieve a united-front policy against the Japanese, which would strengthen the overall position of the CCP</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;sixtyseven1&quot;/&gt; Debate within Yan'an ended when a long telegram from [[Joseph Stalin]] arrived, urging the CCP to work towards Chiang's release, explaining that a united-front was the best position from which to resist the Japanese, and that only Chiang had the prestige and authority to carry out such a plan</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Spence 408&lt;/ref&gt;After initial communications with Zhang on the fate of Chiang, Zhou Enlai reached Xi'an on 16 December, on a plane specifically sent for him by Zhang Xueliang, as the chief Communist negotiator</span>
				<span class='text'>From then until Christmas Day of 1936, Zhou attempted to negotiate with Chiang and Zhang, proposing a national united-front government with Chiang as leader, a demarcation line between KMT and CPP territories, a national conference including a CCP delegation, and a series of future negotiations in Nanjing</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Neg1&quot;&gt;Spence 409&lt;/ref&gt; Through days of intense negotiation, exercising extreme caution and courtesy, Zhou was largely successful in reconciling their positions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;sixtyseven1&quot;&gt;Barnouin and Yu 67&lt;/ref&gt;On 20 December, [[T</span>
				<span class='text'>V</span>
				<span class='text'>Soong]] arrived in Xi'an, and [[Soong Mei-ling]] arrived two days later, in order to negotiate Chiang's release</span>
				<span class='text'>At first, Chiang was opposed to negotiating with a CCP delegate, but withdrew his opposition when it became clear that his life and freedom were largely dependent on Communist goodwill towards him</span>
				<span class='text'>On 24 December, Chiang received Zhou for a meeting, the first time that the two had seen each other since Zhou had left [[Huangpu District, Guangzhou|Whampoa]] over ten years earlier</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou began the conversation by saying: &quot;In the ten years since we have met, you seem to have aged very little</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Chiang nodded and said: &quot;Enlai, you were my subordinate</span>
				<span class='text'>You should do what I say</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Zhou replied that, if Chiang would halt the civil war and resist the Japanese instead, the Red Army would willingly accept Chiang's command</span>
				<span class='text'>By the end of this meeting, Chiang promised to end the civil war, to resist the Japanese together, and to invite Zhou to Nanjing for further talks</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;sixtyseven1&quot; /&gt;On 25 December 1936, Zhang released Chiang and accompanied him to Nanjing</span>
				<span class='text'>Subsequently, Zhang was court-martialed and sentenced to house arrest, and most of the officers who participated in the Xi'an Incident were executed</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the KMT formally rejected collaboration with the CCP, Chiang ended active military activity against Communist bases in Yan'nan, implying that he had implicitly given his word to change the direction of his policies</span>
				<span class='text'>Following the end of KMT attacks, the CCP was able to consolidate its territories and to prepare to resist the Japanese</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Neg1&quot; /&gt;After news arrived that Zhang had been betrayed and arrested by Chiang, Zhang's old officer corps became very agitated, and some of them murdered a Nationalist general, Wang Yizhe, who was seen as largely responsible for the military's lack of response</span>
				<span class='text'>While Zhou was still in Xi'an, he himself was surrounded in his office by a number of Zhang's officers, who accused the Communists of instigating the Xi'an Incident and of betraying Zhang by convincing the general to travel to Nanjing</span>
				<span class='text'>At gunpoint, they threatened to kill Zhou</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou maintained his composure and eloquently defended his position</span>
				<span class='text'>In the end, Zhou succeeded in calming the officers, and they departed, leaving him unharmed</span>
				<span class='text'>In a series of negotiations with the KMT that lasted until June 1937 (when the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] occurred), Zhou attempted to gain Zhang's release, but failed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 68&lt;/ref&gt;==Activities during World War II=====Propaganda and intelligence in Wuhan===When the capital of Nanjing [[Battle of Nanjing|fell to the Japanese]] on 13 December 1937, Zhou accompanied the Nationalist government to its temporary capital of [[Wuhan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>As the chief representative of the CCP in the nominal KMT-CCP cooperation agreement, Zhou established and headed the official KMT-CCP liaison office</span>
				<span class='text'>While running the liaison office, Zhou established the Yangtze Bureau of the Central Committee</span>
				<span class='text'>Under cover of its association with the [[Eighth Route Army]], Zhou used the Yangtze Bureau to conduct clandestine operations within southern China, secretly recruiting Communist operatives and establishing Party structures throughout KMT-controlled areas</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Twentyone1&quot;&gt;Barnouin and Yu 71&lt;/ref&gt;In August 1937, the CCP secretly issued orders to Zhou that his united front work was to focus on Communist infiltration and organization at all levels of the government and society</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou agreed to these orders, and applied his considerable organizational talents to completing them</span>
				<span class='text'>Shortly after Zhou's arrival in Wuhan, he convinced the Nationalist government to approve and fund a Communist newspaper, ''Xinhua ribao'' (&quot;New China Daily&quot;), justifying it as a tool to spread anti-Japanese propaganda</span>
				<span class='text'>This newspaper became a major tool for spreading Communist propaganda, and the Nationalists later viewed its approval and funding as one of their &quot;biggest mistakes&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name =&quot;Seventytwo1&quot;&gt;Barnouin and Yu 72&lt;/ref&gt;Zhou was successful in organizing large numbers of Chinese intellectuals and artists to promote resistance against the Japanese</span>
				<span class='text'>The largest propaganda event that Zhou staged was a week-long celebration in 1938, following the successful [[Battle of Taierzhuang|defense of Taierzhuang]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In this event, between 400,000–500,000 people took part in parades, and a chorus of over 10,000 people sung songs of resistance</span>
				<span class='text'>Fundraising efforts during the week raised over a million yuan</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou himself donated 240 yuan, his monthly salary as deputy director of the Political Department</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name =&quot;Seventytwo1&quot; /&gt;While he was working in Wuhan, Zhou was the CCP's main contact person with the outside world, and worked hard to reverse the public perception of the Communists as a &quot;bandit organization&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou established and maintained contacts with over forty foreign journalists and writers, including [[Edgar Snow]], [[Agnes Smedley]], [[Anna Louise Strong]] and [[Rewi Alley]], many of whom became sympathetic to the Communist cause and wrote about their sympathies in foreign publications</span>
				<span class='text'>In sympathy with his efforts to promote the CCP to the outside world, Zhou arranged for a Canadian medical team, headed by [[Norman Bethune]], to travel to Yan'an, and assisted the Dutch film director [[Joris Ivens]] in producing a documentary, ''400 Million People''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 72–73&lt;/ref&gt;Zhou was unsuccessful in averting the public defection of [[Zhang Guotao]], one of the founders of the CCP, to the KMT</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhang was prepared to defect due to a disagreement with [[Mao Zedong]] over the implementation of the united front policy, and because he resented Mao's authoritarian leadership style</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou, with the aid of [[Wang Ming]], [[Bo Gu]] and [[Li Kenong]], intercepted Zhang after he arrived in Wuhan, and engaged in extensive negotiations through April 1938, in order to convince Zhang not to defect, but these negotiations were unsuccessful</span>
				<span class='text'>In the end, Zhang refused to compromise and placed himself under the protection of the KMT secret police</span>
				<span class='text'>On 18 April, the CCP Central Committee expelled Zhang from the Party, and Zhang himself issued a statement accusing the CCP of sabotaging efforts to resist the Japanese</span>
				<span class='text'> The entire episode was a serious setback for Zhou's attempts to improve the prestige of the Party</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 73–74&lt;/ref&gt;===Military strategy in Wuhan===In January 1938, the Nationalist government appointed Zhou as the deputy director to the Political Department of the Military Committee, working directly under General [[Cheng Cheng]]</span>
				<span class='text'>As a senior Communist statesman holding the rank of lieutenant-general, Zhou was the only Communist to hold a high-level position within the Nationalist government</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou used his influence within the Military Committee to promote Nationalist generals that he believed were capable, and to promote cooperation with the Red Army</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Twentyone1&quot; /&gt;In the [[Battle of Taierzhuang|Tai'erzhuang campaign]], Zhou used his influence to ensure that the most capable Nationalist general available, [[Li Zongren]] be appointed overall commander, despite Chiang's reservations about Li's loyalty</span>
				<span class='text'>When Chiang was hesitant to commit troops to the defense of [[Tai'erzhuang]], Zhou convinced Chiang to do so by promising that the Communist [[Eighth Route Army]] would simultaneously attack the Japanese from the north, and that the [[New Fourth Army]] would sabotage the [[Tianjin–Pukou Railway Operation|Tianjin-Pukou railroad]], cutting off Japanese supplies</span>
				<span class='text'> In the end, the defense of Tai'erzhuang was a major victory for the Nationalists, killing 20,000 Japanese soldiers and capturing a large amount of supplies and equipment</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Twentyone1&quot; /&gt;===Adoption of orphans===While serving as the CCP ambassador to the KMT, the childless Zhou met and befriended numerous orphans</span>
				<span class='text'>While in Wuhan Zhou adopted a young girl, [[Sun Weishi]], in 1937</span>
				<span class='text'>Sun's mother had taken her to Wuhan after Sun's father was executed by the KMT in 1927, during the [[Shanghai massacre of 1927|White Terror]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou came upon the sixteen-year-old Sun crying outside of the Eighth Route Army Liaison Office because she had been refused permission to travel to Yan'an, due to her youth and lack of political connections</span>
				<span class='text'>After Zhou befriended and adopted her as his daughter, Sun was able to travel to Yan'an</span>
				<span class='text'>She pursued a career in acting and direction, and later became the first female director of spoken drama (''huaju'') in the PRC</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Lee497&quot;&gt;Lee and Stephanowska 497&lt;/ref&gt;Zhou also adopted Sun's brother, Sun Yang</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Zhang 3&lt;/ref&gt; After accompanying Zhou to Yan'an, Sun Yang became Zhou's personal assistant</span>
				<span class='text'>After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Sun Yang became the president of [[Renmin University]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Lee497&quot; /&gt;In 1938 Zhou met and befriended another orphan, [[Li Peng]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Li was only three when, in 1931, his father was also killed by the Kuomintang</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou subsequently looked after him in [[Yan'an]]</span>
				<span class='text'> After the war, Zhou systematically groomed Li for leadership and sent him to be educated in energy-related engineering in Moscow</span>
				<span class='text'> Zhou's placement of Li within the powerful energy bureaucracy shielded Li from [[Red Guards (People's Republic of China)|Red Guards]] during the [[Cultural Revolution]], and Li's eventual rise to the level of Premier surprised no one</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Spence 688&lt;/ref&gt;===Flight to Chongqing===When the Japanese army approached Wuhan in the fall of 1938, the [[National Revolutionary Army|Nationalist Army]] [[Battle of Wuhan|engaged the Japanese]] in the surrounding regions for over four months, allowing the KMT to withdraw farther inland, to [[Chongqing]], bringing with them important supplies, assets, and many refugees</span>
				<span class='text'> While he was en route to Chongqing, Zhou was nearly killed in the [[1938 Changsha Fire|&quot;fire of Changsha&quot;]], which lasted for three days, destroyed two thirds of the city, killed twenty thousand civilians, and left hundreds of thousands of people homeless</span>
				<span class='text'> This fire was deliberately caused by the retreating Nationalist army in order to prevent the city from falling to the Japanese</span>
				<span class='text'> Due to an organizational error (it was claimed), the fire was begun without any warning to the residents of the city</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 74&lt;/ref&gt;After escaping from [[Changsha]], Zhou took refuge in a Buddhist temple in a nearby village and organized the evacuation of the city</span>
				<span class='text'> Zhou demanded that the causes of the fire be thoroughly investigated by authorities, that those responsible by punished, that reparations be given to the victims, that the city be thoroughly cleaned up, and that accommodations be provided for the homeless</span>
				<span class='text'> In the end, the Nationalists blamed three local commanders for the fire and executed them</span>
				<span class='text'> Newspapers across China blamed the fire on (non-KMT) arsonists, but the blaze contributed to a nationwide loss of support for the KMT</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 74–75&lt;/ref&gt;===Early activities in Chongqing===Zhou Enlai reached Chongqing in December 1938, and resumed the official and unofficial operations that he had been conducting in Wuhan in January 1938</span>
				<span class='text'> Zhou's activities included those required by his formal positions within the Nationalist government, his running of two pro-Communist newspapers, and his covert efforts to form reliable intelligence networks and increase the popularity and organization of CCP organizations in southern China</span>
				<span class='text'>At its peak, the staff working under him in both official and covert roles totaled several hundred people</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 75–76&lt;/ref&gt;  After finding that his father, Zhou Shaogang, was unable to support himself, Zhou looked after his father in Chongqing until his father's death in 1942</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;BY124&quot; /&gt;Soon after arriving in Chongqing, Zhou successfully lobbied the Nationalist government to release Communist political prisoners</span>
				<span class='text'>After their release, Zhou often assigned these former prisoners as agents to organize and lead Party organizations throughout southern China</span>
				<span class='text'> The efforts of Zhou's covert activities were extremely successful, increasing CCP membership across southern China tenfold within months</span>
				<span class='text'>Chiang was somewhat aware of these activities and introduced efforts to suppress them, but was generally unsuccessful</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 76–77&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Sun Weishi Zhou Enlai in Moscow</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|right|thumb|220px|Zhou Enlai and Sun Weishi in Moscow, 1939</span>
				<span class='text'>]In July 1939, while in Yan'an to attend a series of Politburo meetings, Zhou had an accident horseback riding in which he fell and fractured his right elbow</span>
				<span class='text'> Because there was little medical care available in Yan'an, Zhou traveled to [[Moscow]] for medical treatment, using the occasion to brief the [[Comintern]] on the status of the united front</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou arrived in Moscow too late to mend the fracture, and his right arm remained bent for the rest of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Joseph Stalin]] was so displeased with the CCP's refusal to work more closely with the Nationalists that he refused to see Zhou during his stay</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 77&lt;/ref&gt; Zhou's adopted daughter, Sun Weishi, accompanied Zhou to Moscow</span>
				<span class='text'>She remained in Moscow after Zhou left in order to study for a career in theatre</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Lee497&quot; /&gt;===Intelligence work in Chongqing===On 4 May 1939, the Politburo accepted Zhou's assessment that Zhou should focus his efforts on creating a network of secret CCP agents working covertly and for long periods</span>
				<span class='text'>Communists were directed to join the KMT, if doing so would increase the ability of agents to infiltrate the KMT administrative, educational, economic, and military establishments</span>
				<span class='text'>Under the cover of the Office of the Eighth Route Army (moved to a stately building on the outskirts of Chongqing), Zhou adopted a series of measures to expand the CCP intelligence network</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;BY78&quot;&gt;Barnouin and Yu 78&lt;/ref&gt;By the time that Zhou returned to Chongqing in May 1940, a serious rift had formed between the KMT and the CCP</span>
				<span class='text'> Over the course of the next year, the relationship between the two parties degenerated into arrests and executions of Party members, covert attempts by agents of both sides to eliminate each other, propaganda efforts attacking each other, and major military clashes</span>
				<span class='text'>The united front was officially abolished after the [[New Fourth Army Incident|Anhui Incident]] in January 1941, when 9,000 Communist soldiers of the [[New Fourth Army]] were ambushed, and their commanders either killed or imprisoned by government troops</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 77, 82–83&lt;/ref&gt;Zhou responded to the rift between the KMT and CCP by directing Party leaders to conduct their operations more secretly</span>
				<span class='text'>He maintained propaganda efforts via the newspapers that he directed and kept in close contact with foreign journalists and ambassadors</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou increased and improved CCP intelligence efforts  within the KMT, Wang Jingwei's [[Reorganized National Government of China|Nanjing government]], and the Empire of Japan, recruiting, training, and organizing a large network of Communist spies</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Yan Baohang]], a secret Party member active in Chongqing diplomatic circles, informed Zhou that Hitler was planning to attack the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941</span>
				<span class='text'>Under Zhou's signature, this information reached Stalin on 20 June, two days before Hitler attacked</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 82–87&lt;/ref&gt;===Economic and diplomatic activities===Despite worsening relations with [[Chiang Kai-shek]], Zhou operated openly in Chongqing, befriending Chinese and foreign visitors and staging public cultural activities, especially Chinese theater</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou cultivated a close personal friendship with General [[Feng Yuxiang]], making it possible for Zhou to circulate freely among the officers of the Nationalist Army</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou befriended the General [[He Jifeng]], and convinced He to secretly become a member of the CCP during an official visit to Yan'an</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou's intelligence agents penetrated the [[Sichuan]]ese army of General [[Deng Xihou]], resulting in Deng's secret agreement to supply ammunition to the Communist New Fourth Army</span>
				<span class='text'> Zhou convinced another Sichuanese general, [[Li Wenhui]], to covertly install a radio transmitter that facilitated secret communication between Yan'an and Chongqing</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou befriended [[Zhang Chong]] and [[Nong Yun]], commanders in the [[Yunnan]] armed forces, who became secret CCP members, agreed to cooperate with the CCP against Chiang Kai-shek, and established a clandestine radio station that broadcast Communist propaganda from the provincial government building in [[Kunming]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 88&lt;/ref&gt;Zhou remained the primary CCP representative to the outside world during his time in Chongqing</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou enjoyed receiving foreign visitors and reportedly made a favorable impression among American, British, Canadian, Russian, and other foreign diplomats, despite Chiang's attempts to isolate him from the international community</span>
				<span class='text'> Zhou was variously described by visitors as being charming, urbane, hard-working, and living a very simple lifestyle</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1941, Zhou received a visit from [[Ernest Hemingway]] and his wife, [[Martha Gellhorn|Martha]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Martha later wrote that she and Ernest were extremely impressed with Zhou (and extremely unimpressed with Chiang), and they became convinced that the Communists would take over China after meeting him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 89&lt;/ref&gt;Because Yan'an was incapable of funding Zhou's activities, Zhou attempted to fund himself through various means</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou partially funded his efforts though donations from sympathetic foreigners, overseas Chinese, and the [[China Welfare Institute|China Defense League]] (supported by Sun Yat-sen's widow, [[Soong Ching-ling]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Because Zhou was not able to fund his operations solely through donations, Zhou also undertook efforts to start and run a number of businesses throughout KMT- and Japanese- controlled China</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou's businesses grew to include several trading companies operating in a variety of Chinese cities (primarily Chongqing and Hong Kong), a silk and satin store in Chongqing, an oil refinery, and numerous factories for producing industrial materials, various cloths, Western medicines, and other commodities</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;BY80&quot;&gt;Barnouin and Yu 79–80&lt;/ref&gt;Under Zhou, Communist businessmen made great profits engaging in currency trading and commodity speculation, especially in the international markets for American dollars and gold</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou's most lucrative business was generated by several opium plantations that Zhou established in remote areas</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the CCP had been engaged in the eradication of opium smoking since its establishment, Zhou justified opium production and distribution in KMT-controlled areas by the huge profits generated for the CCP, and by the debilitating effects that opium addiction might have on KMT soldiers and government officials</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;BY80&quot; /&gt;===Relationship with Mao Zedong===In 1943, Zhou's relationship with Chiang Kai-shek deteriorated, and he returned permanently to Yan'an</span>
				<span class='text'> By then, Mao Zedong had emerged as the [[Chairman of the Communist Party of China]], and was attempting to have his political theories (literally [[Maoism|&quot;Mao Zedong Thought&quot;]]) accepted as the Party's dogma</span>
				<span class='text'>Following his ascent to power, Mao organized [[Yan'an Rectification Movement|a campaign]] to indoctrinate the members of the CCP</span>
				<span class='text'>This campaign became the foundation of the Maoist personality cult that later dominated Chinese politics until the end of the [[Cultural Revolution]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ninetyfive1&quot;&gt;Barnouin and Yu 91–95&lt;/ref&gt;After returning to Yan'an, Zhou Enlai was strongly and excessively criticized in this campaign</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou was labelled, along with the generals [[Peng Dehuai]], [[Liu Bocheng]], [[Ye Jianying]], and [[Nie Rongzhen]], as an &quot;empiricist&quot; because he had a history of cooperating with the Comintern and with Mao's enemy, [[Wang Ming]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Mao publicly attacked Zhou as &quot;a collaborator and assistant of dogmatism</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>who belittled the study of Marxism-Leninism&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Mao and his allies then claimed that the CCP organizations that Zhou had established in southern China were in fact led by KMT secret agents, a charge which Zhou firmly denied, and which was only withdrawn after Mao became convinced of Zhou's subservience in the latest period of the campaign</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ninetyfive1&quot; /&gt;Zhou defended himself by engaging in a long series of public reflections and self-criticisms, and he gave a number of speeches praising Mao and Mao Zedong Thought and giving his unconditional acceptance of Mao's leadership</span>
				<span class='text'>He also joined Mao's allies in attacking [[Peng Shuzhi]], [[Chen Duxiu]], and [[Wang Ming]], who Mao viewed as enemies</span>
				<span class='text'> The persecution of Zhou Enlai distressed Moscow, and [[Georgi Dimitrov]] wrote a personal letter to Mao indicating that &quot;Zhou Enlai</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>must not be severed from the Party</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;  In the end, Zhou's enthusiastic acknowledgement of his own faults, his praise for Mao's leadership, and his attacks on Mao's enemies eventually convinced Mao that Zhou's conversion to Maoism was genuine, a precondition for Zhou's political survival</span>
				<span class='text'>By the seventh congress of the CCP in 1945, Mao was acknowledged as the overall leader of the CCP, and the dogma of Mao Zedong Thought was firmly entrenched among the Party's leadership</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ninetyfive1&quot; /&gt;==Diplomatic efforts with the United States=====The Dixie mission==={{Main|Dixie Mission}}After the United States joined the war against Japan in 1941, American politicians and military advisors became increasingly interested in making contact with the Communists in order to coordinate attacks on the Japanese</span>
				<span class='text'>In June 1944, [[Chiang Kai-shek]] agreed to allow an American military observation group, known as the &quot;Dixie mission&quot;, to travel to Yan'an</span>
				<span class='text'>Mao and Zhou welcomed this mission and held numerous talks in the interest of gaining access to American aid</span>
				<span class='text'>They pledged support for any future American military actions on Chinese soil, and attempted to convince the Americans that the CCP was committed to a united KMT-CCP government</span>
				<span class='text'>In a gesture of goodwill, [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) guerrilla units were instructed to rescue Allied soldiers (who were mostly American airmen) held prisoner in China</span>
				<span class='text'> By the time that the Americans left Yan'an, many had become convinced that the CCP was &quot;a party seeking orderly democratic growth towards socialism&quot;, and the mission formally suggested greater cooperation between the CCP and the American military</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 95–97&lt;/ref&gt;===1944–1945===In 1944, Zhou wrote to General [[Joseph Stillwell]], the American commander of the [[China Burma India Theater of World War II|China Burma India war theater]], attempting to convince  Stillwell of the need for the Americans to supply the Communists, and of the Communist's desire for a united Chinese government after the war</span>
				<span class='text'> Stillwell's open disenchantment with the Nationalist government in general, and with Chiang Kai-shek specifically, motivated President [[Franklin D</span>
				<span class='text'>Roosevelt]] to remove him that same year, before Zhou's diplomacy could be effective</span>
				<span class='text'> Stillwell's replacement, [[Patrick J</span>
				<span class='text'>Hurley]], was receptive to Zhou's appeals, but ultimately refused to align the American military with the CCP unless the Party made concessions to the KMT, which Mao and Zhou found unacceptable</span>
				<span class='text'> Soon after Japan surrendered in 1945, Chiang invited Mao and Zhou to Chongqing to take part in an American-endorsed peace conference</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 97–100&lt;/ref&gt;===The Chongqing negotiations===There was widespread apprehension in Yan'an that the invitation from Chiang was a trap, and that the Nationalists were planning to assassinate or imprison the two instead</span>
				<span class='text'> Zhou took control over Mao's security detail, and his subsequent inspections of their plane and lodgings found nothing</span>
				<span class='text'>Throughout the trip to Chongqing, Mao refused to enter his accommodations until they had been personally inspected by Zhou</span>
				<span class='text'>Mao and Zhou traveled together to receptions, banquets, and other public gatherings, and Zhou introduced him to numerous local celebrities and statesmen that he had befriended during his earlier stay in Chongqing</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 97–101&lt;/ref&gt;During the forty-three days of negotiations, Mao and Chiang met eleven times to discuss the conditions of post-war China, while Zhou worked on confirming the details of the negotiations</span>
				<span class='text'>In the end, the negotiations resolved nothing</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou's offer to withdraw the Red Army from southern China was ignored, and P</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Hurley's ultimatum to incorporate the CCP into the KMT insulted Mao</span>
				<span class='text'> After Mao returned to Yan'an on 10 October 1945, Zhou stayed behind to sort out the details of the conference's resolution</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou returned to Yan'an on 27 November 1945, when major skirmishes between the Communists and Nationalists made future negotiations pointless</span>
				<span class='text'> Hurley himself subsequently announced his resignation, accusing members of the US embassy of undermining him and favoring the Communists</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 101–104&lt;/ref&gt;===The Marshall negotiations==={{Main|Marshall Mission}}After [[Harry S</span>
				<span class='text'>Truman]] became President of the United States, he nominated General [[George Marshall|George C</span>
				<span class='text'>Marshall]] as his special envoy to China on 15 December 1945</span>
				<span class='text'>Marshall was charged with brokering a ceasefire between the CCP and KMT, and to influence both Mao and Chiang to abide by the Chongqing agreement, which both had signed</span>
				<span class='text'> The top leadership within the CCP, including Zhou, viewed Marshall's nomination as a positive development, and hoped that Marshall would be a more flexible negotiator than Hurley had been</span>
				<span class='text'> Zhou arrived in Chongqing to negotiate with Marshall on 22 December</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 104–105&lt;/ref&gt;The first phase of talks went smoothly</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou represented the Communists, Marshall represented the Americans, and [[Zhang Qun]] (later replaced by [[Zhang Zhizhong]]) represented the KMT</span>
				<span class='text'> In January 1946 both sides agreed to cease hostilities, and to reorganize their armies on the principle of separating the army from political parties</span>
				<span class='text'> Zhou signed these agreements in the knowledge that neither side would be able to implement these changes</span>
				<span class='text'> Chiang delivered a speech promising political freedom, local autonomy, free elections, and the release of political prisoners</span>
				<span class='text'> Zhou welcomed Chiang's statements and expressed his opposition to civil war</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 105&lt;/ref&gt;The leadership of the CCP viewed these agreements optimistically</span>
				<span class='text'> On 27 January 1946 the CCP Secretariat appointed Zhou as one of eight leaders to participate in a future coalition government (other leaders included Mao, [[Liu Shaoqi]], and Zhu De)</span>
				<span class='text'> It was suggested that Zhou be nominated as China's vice president</span>
				<span class='text'>Mao expressed a desire to visit the United States, and Zhou received orders to manipulate Marshall in order to advance the peace process</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 106&lt;/ref&gt;Marshall's negotiations soon deteriorated, as neither the KMT nor the CCP were willing to sacrifice any of the advantages that they had gained, to de-politicize their armies, or to sacrifice any degree of autonomy in areas their side controlled</span>
				<span class='text'>Military clashes in [[Manchuria]] became increasingly frequent in the spring and summer of 1946, eventually forcing Communist forces to retreat after a few major battles</span>
				<span class='text'> Government armies increased their attacks in other parts of China</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 106–107&lt;/ref&gt;On 3 May 1946, Zhou and his wife left Chongqing for Nanjing, where the Nationalist capital returned</span>
				<span class='text'> Negotiations deteriorated, and on 9 October Zhou informed Marshall that he no longer had the confidence of the CCP</span>
				<span class='text'> On 11 October Nationalist troops seized the Communist city of [[Zhangjiakou]] in northern China</span>
				<span class='text'> Chiang, confident in his ability to defeat the Communists, called the National Assembly into session without the participation of the CCP and ordered it to draft a constitution on 15 November</span>
				<span class='text'> On 16 November Zhou held a press conference, in which he condemned the KMT for &quot;tearing up the agreements from the political consultative conference&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'> On 19 November Zhou and the entire CCP delegation left Nanjing for Yan'an</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 107–108&lt;/ref&gt;==Resumption of Civil War=====Military strategist and intelligence chief===Following the failure of negotiations, the Chinese Civil War resumed in earnest</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou turned his focus from diplomatic to military affairs, while retaining a senior interest in intelligence work</span>
				<span class='text'> Zhou worked directly under Mao as his chief aide, as the vice chairman of the Military Commission of the Central Committee, and as the general chief of staff</span>
				<span class='text'> As the head of the Urban Work Committee of the Central Committee, an agency established to coordinate work inside KMT-controlled areas, Zhou continued to direct underground activities</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 108&lt;/ref&gt;A superior force of Nationalist troops captured Yan'an in March 1947, but Zhou's intelligence agents (primarily [[Xiong Xianghui]]) were able to provide Yan'an's commanding general, Peng Dehuai, with details of the KMT army's troop strength, distribution, positions, air cover, and dates of deployment</span>
				<span class='text'> This intelligence allowed Communist forces to avoid major battles and to engage Nationalist forces in a protracted campaign of [[guerrilla warfare]] that eventually led to Peng achieving a series of major victories</span>
				<span class='text'> By February 1948 over half the KMT troops in the northwest were either defeated or exhausted</span>
				<span class='text'> On 4 May 1948 Peng captured 40,000 army uniforms and over a million pieces of artillery</span>
				<span class='text'>By January 1949 Communist forces seized [[Beijing]] and [[Tianjin]], and were firmly in control of north China</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 110–116&lt;/ref&gt;===Diplomacy===On 21 January 1949 Chiang stepped down as president of the Nationalist government and was succeeded by General [[Li Zongren]]</span>
				<span class='text'> On 1 April 1949 Li began a series of peace negotiations with a six-member CCP delegation</span>
				<span class='text'>The CCP delegates were led by Zhou Enlai, and the KMT delegates were led by Zhang Zhizhong</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Barnouin and Yu 117&quot;&gt;Barnouin and Yu 117&lt;/ref&gt;Zhou began the negotiations by asking: &quot;Why did you go to Xikou (where Chiang had retired) to see Chiang Kai-shek before leaving Nanjing?&quot;  Zhang responded that Chiang still had power, even though he had technically retired, and that his consent would be needed to finalize any agreement</span>
				<span class='text'> Zhou responded that the CCP would not accept a bogus peace dictated by Chiang, and asked whether Zhang had come with the necessary credentials to implement the terms desired by the CCP</span>
				<span class='text'>Negotiations continued until 15 April, when Zhou produced a &quot;final version&quot; of a &quot;draft agreement for internal peace&quot;, which was essentially an ultimatum to accept CCP demands</span>
				<span class='text'> The KMT government did not respond after five days, signaling that it was not prepared to accept Zhou's demands</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;BY118&quot;&gt;Barnouin and Yu 118&lt;/ref&gt;On 21 April Mao and Zhou issued an &quot;order to the army for country-wide advance&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'> PLA troops captured Nanjing on 23 April, and captured Li's stronghold of [[Guangdong]] in October, forcing Li to go into exile in America</span>
				<span class='text'> In December 1949 PLA troops captured [[Chengdu]], the last KMT-controlled city on mainland China, forcing Chiang to evacuate to [[Taiwan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;BY118&quot; /&gt;==PRC diplomat and statesman=====Diplomatic situation of the PRC in 1949===By the early 1950s, China's international influence was extremely low</span>
				<span class='text'> By the end of the [[Qing Dynasty]] in 1911, China's pretentions of universalism had been shattered by a string of military defeats and incursions by Europeans and Japanese</span>
				<span class='text'> By the end of [[Yuan Shikai]]'s reign and the subsequent [[Warlord Era]], China's international prestige had declined to &quot;almost nothing&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'> In World War II, China's effective role was sometimes questioned by other Allied leaders</span>
				<span class='text'> The 1950–1953 [[Korean War]] greatly exacerbated China's international position by fixing the United States in a position of animosity, ensuring that Taiwan would remain outside of PRC control and that the PRC would remain outside of the United Nations for the foreseeable future</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;EarlyPRC1&quot;&gt;Spence 524&lt;/ref&gt;Following the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1 October 1949, Zhou was appointed both Premier of the Government Administration Council (later replaced by the State Council) and Minister of Foreign Affairs</span>
				<span class='text'>Through the coordination of these two offices and his position as a member of the five-man standing committee of the Politburo, Zhou became the architect of early PRC foreign policy, presenting China as a new, yet responsible member of the international community</span>
				<span class='text'>By the early 1950s, Zhou was an experienced negotiator and was respected as a senior revolutionary within China</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;EarlyPRC1&quot; /&gt;Zhou's earliest efforts to improve the prestige of the PRC involved recruiting prominent Chinese politicians, capitalists, intellectuals, and military leaders who were not technically affiliated with the CCP</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou was able to convince [[Zhang Zhizhong]] to accept a position inside the PRC in 1949, after Zhou's underground network successfully escorted Zhang's family to Beijing</span>
				<span class='text'>All of the other members of the KMT delegation that Zhou had negotiated with in 1949 accepted similar terms</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 128–129&lt;/ref&gt;[[Sun Yat-sen]]'s widow, [[Soong Ching-ling]], who was estranged from her family and who had opposed the KMT for many years, readily joined the PRC in 1949</span>
				<span class='text'> [[Huang Yuanpei]], a prominent industrialist who had refused offers of a government post for many years, was persuaded to accept a position as vice premier in the new government</span>
				<span class='text'> [[Fu Zuoyi]], the KMT commander who had surrendered the Beijing garrison in 1948, was persuaded to join the PLA, and to accept a position as the minister of water conservation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 129&lt;/ref&gt;===Diplomacy with India===Zhou's first diplomatic successes came as the result of successfully pursuing a warm relationship, based on mutual respect, with India's first post-independence prime minister, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Through his diplomacy, Zhou managed to persuade India to accept China's occupation of Tibet in 1950 and 1951</span>
				<span class='text'>India was later persuaded to act as a neutral mediator between China and the United States during the many difficult phases of the negotiations settling the Korean War</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Spence, 1999, p</span>
				<span class='text'>552&lt;/ref&gt;===The Korean War===When the [[Korean War]] broke out on 25 June 1950, Zhou was in the process of demobilizing half of the PLA's 5</span>
				<span class='text'> million soldiers, under the direction of the Central Committee</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou and Mao discussed the possibility of American intervention with [[Kim Il-sung]] in May, and urged Kim to be cautious if he was to invade and conquer South Korea, but Kim refused to take these warnings seriously</span>
				<span class='text'> On 28 June 1950, after the United States pushed through a UN resolution condemning North Korean aggression and sent the [[United States Seventh Fleet|Seventh Fleet]] to &quot;neutralize&quot; the [[Taiwan Strait]], Zhou criticized both the UN and US initiatives as &quot;armed aggression on Chinese territory</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 140&lt;/ref&gt;Although Kim's early success led him to predict that he would win the war by August, Chinese leaders were more pessimistic</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou did not share Kim's confidence that the war would end quickly, and became increasingly apprehensive that the United States would intervene</span>
				<span class='text'> To counter the possibility of an American invasion into North Korea or China, Zhou secured a Soviet commitment to have the USSR support Chinese forces with air cover, and deployed 260,000 Chinese soldiers along the North Korean border, under the command of [[Gao Gang]], but they were strictly ordered not to move into North Korea or engage UN or USA forces unless they engaged themselves</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou commanded [[Chai Chengwen]] to conduct a topographical survey of Korea, and directed [[Lei Yingfu]], Zhou's military advisor in North Korea, to analyze the military situation there</span>
				<span class='text'> Lei concluded that [[Douglas MacArthur|MacArthur]] would most likely attempt a landing at [[Incheon]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 141&lt;/ref&gt;On 15 September 1950 MacArthur landed at Incheon, met little resistance, and captured Seoul on 25 September</span>
				<span class='text'> Bombing raids destroyed most North Korean tanks and much of its artillery</span>
				<span class='text'> North Korean troops, instead of withdrawing north, rapidly disintegrated</span>
				<span class='text'> On 30 September, Zhou warned the United States that &quot;the Chinese people will not tolerate foreign aggression, nor will they supinely tolerate seeing their neighbors being savagely invaded by imperialists</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 143&lt;/ref&gt;On 1 October, on the first anniversary of the PRC, South Korean troops crossed the Thirty-Eighth Parallel into North Korea</span>
				<span class='text'>Stalin refused to become directly involved in the war, and Kim sent a frantic appeal to Mao to reinforce his army</span>
				<span class='text'> On 2 October, the Chinese leadership continued an emergency meeting at [[Zhongnanhai]] to discuss whether China should send military aid, and these talks continued until 6 October</span>
				<span class='text'> At the meeting, Zhou was one of the few firm supporters of Mao's position that China should send military aid, regardless of the strength of American forces</span>
				<span class='text'>With the endorsement of Peng Dehuai, the meeting concluded with a resolution to send military forces to Korea</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 144–146&lt;/ref&gt;In order to enlist Stalin's support, Zhou traveled to Stalin's summer resort on the [[Black Sea]] on 10 October</span>
				<span class='text'> Stalin initially agreed to send military equipment and ammunition, but warned Zhou that the USSR's air force would need two or three months to prepare any operations and no ground troops were to be sent</span>
				<span class='text'> In a subsequent meeting, Stalin told Zhou that he would only provide China with equipment on a credit basis, and that the Soviet air force would only operate over Chinese airspace after an undisclosed period of time</span>
				<span class='text'> Stalin did not agree to send either military equipment or air support until March 1951</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 146, 149&lt;/ref&gt;Immediately on his return to Beijing on 18 October 1950, Zhou met with Mao Zedong, Peng Dehuai, and Gao Gang, and the group ordered the 200,000 Chinese troops along the border to enter North Korea, which they did on 25 October</span>
				<span class='text'>After consulting with Stalin, on 13 November, Mao appointed Zhou the overall commander of the [[People's Volunteer Army]], a special unit of the [[People's Liberation Army]], China's armed forces that would intervene in the Korean conflict and coordinator of the war effort, with Peng as field commander of the PVA</span>
				<span class='text'>Orders given by Zhou to the PVA were delivered in the name of the Central Military Commission</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 147–148&lt;/ref&gt;By June 1951, the war had reached a stalemate around the Thirty-eighth Parallel, and the two sides agreed to negotiate an armistice</span>
				<span class='text'> Zhou directed the truce talks, which began on 10 July</span>
				<span class='text'> Zhou chose [[Li Kenong]] and [[Qiao Guanhua]] to head the Chinese negotiating team</span>
				<span class='text'>The negotiations proceeded for two years before reaching a ceasefire agreement on July 1953, formally signed at [[Panmunjom]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 149–150&lt;/ref&gt;The Korean War was Zhou's last military assignment</span>
				<span class='text'> In 1952, Peng Dehuai succeeded Zhou in managing the [[Central Military Commission (People's Republic of China)|Central Military Commission]] (which Zhou had headed since 1947)</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1956, after the eighth Party Congress, Zhou formally relinquished his post in the Military Commission and focused on his work in the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress|Standing Committee]], the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]], and on foreign affairs</span>

				<span class='text'>Zhou Enlai and [[Anastas Mikoyan]] are among them]]After Stalin died on 5 March 1953, Zhou left for Moscow and attended Stalin's funeral four days later</span>
				<span class='text'> Mao, curiously, decided not to travel to Moscow, possibly because no senior Soviet politician had yet travelled to Beijing, or because Stalin had rejected an offer to meet with Mao in 1948 (nevertheless, a huge memorial service in honor of Stalin was held in [[Beijing]]'s [[Tiananmen Square]] with Mao and hundreds of thousands more in attendance)</span>
				<span class='text'>While in Moscow, Zhou was notably received with considerable respect by Soviet officials, being permitted to stand with the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]'s new leaders—[[Vyacheslav Molotov]], [[Nikita Khrushchev]], [[Georgi Malenkov]], and [[Lavrentiy Beria]]—instead of with the other &quot;foreign&quot; dignitaries who attended</span>
				<span class='text'> With these four leaders, Zhou walked directly behind the gun carriage bearing Stalin's coffin</span>
				<span class='text'> Zhou's diplomatic efforts on his travel to Moscow were rewarded shortly after when, in 1954, Khrushchev himself visited Beijing to take part in the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Barnouin and Yu 117&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EarlyPRC2&quot;&gt;Spence 525&lt;/ref&gt;Throughout the 1950s, Zhou worked to tighten economic and political relations between China and other Communist states, coordinating China's foreign policy with Soviet policies promoting solidarity among political allies</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1952, Zhou signed an economic and cultural agreement with the [[Mongolian People's Republic]], giving ''de facto'' recognition of the independence of what had been known as &quot;[[Outer Mongolia]]&quot; in Qing times</span>
				<span class='text'> Zhou also worked to conclude an agreement with [[Kim Il-sung]] in order to help the postwar reconstruction of [[North Korea]]'s economy</span>
				<span class='text'>Pursuing the goals of peaceful diplomacy with China's neighbors, Zhou held amicable talks with [[Burma]]'s prime minister, [[U Nu]], and promoted China's efforts to send supplies to [[Ho Chi Minh]]'s Vietnamese rebels known as the [[Viet Minh|Vietminh]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;EarlyPRC1&quot; /&gt;===The Geneva Conference==={{Main|Geneva Conference (1954)}}[[File:Zhou Enlai at Geneva</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|350px|Zhou Enlai (middle) at Geneva,1954]]In April 1954, Zhou attended the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]], convened to settle the ongoing [[First Indochina War|Franco-Vietnamese War]]</span>
				<span class='text'> His patience and shrewdness were credited with assisting the major powers involved (the Soviets, French, Americans, and North Vietnamese) to iron out the agreement ending the conflict</span>
				<span class='text'> According to the negotiated peace, French Indochina was to be partitioned into Laos, Cambodia, North Vietnam, and South Vietnam</span>
				<span class='text'>Elections were agreed to be called within two years to create a coalition government in a united Vietnam, and the [[Vietminh]] agreed to end their guerilla activities in South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Geneva1&quot;&gt;Spence 525–526&lt;/ref&gt;During one early meeting in Geneva, Zhou found himself in the same room with the staunchly [[Anti-communism|anti-Communist]] American secretary of state, [[John Foster Dulles]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After Zhou offered to shake his hand, Dulles rudely turned his back and walked out of the room, saying &quot;I cannot&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'> Zhou was interpreted by onlookers as turning this moment of possible humiliation into a small victory by giving only a small, &quot;Gallic-style&quot; shrug to this behaviour</span>
				<span class='text'> Zhou was equally effective in countering Dulles' insistence that China not be given a seat at the sessions</span>
				<span class='text'> Furthering the impression of Chinese urbanity and civility, he had lunch with British actor [[Charlie Chaplin]], who had been living in Switzerland since being blacklisted in the United States for his radical politics</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Geneva1&quot; /&gt;===The Asian–African Conference===In 1955, Zhou was a prominent participant in the [[Asian–African Conference]] held in Indonesia</span>
				<span class='text'>The conference in [[Bandung]] was a meeting of twenty-nine African and Asian states, organized by Indonesia, Burma (Myanmar), Pakistan, Ceylon (Sri Lanka), and India, and was called largely to promote Afro-Asian economic and cultural cooperation and to oppose colonialism or neocolonialism by either the United States or the Soviet Union in the [[Cold War]]</span>
				<span class='text'> At the conference, Zhou skillfully gave the conference a neutral stance that made the United States appear as a serious threat to the peace and stability of the region</span>
				<span class='text'> Zhou complained that, while China was working towards &quot;world peace and the progress of mankind&quot;, &quot;aggressive circles&quot; within the United States were actively aiding the Nationalists in Taiwan and planning to rearm the Japanese</span>
				<span class='text'>He was widely quoted for his remark that &quot;the population of Asia will never forget that the first atom bomb was exploded on Asian soil</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; With the support of its most prestigious participants, the conference produced a strong declaration in favour of peace, the abolition of nuclear arms, general arms reduction, and the principle of universal representation at the United Nations</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Spence 527&lt;/ref&gt;On his way to the Bandung conference, an assassination attempt was made against Zhou when a bomb was planted on the Air India plane ''[[Kashmir Princess]]'', chartered for Zhou's trip from Hong Kong to Jakarta</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou avoided the attempt when he changed planes at the last minute, but all 11 of the flight's other passengers were killed, with only three crew members surviving the crash</span>
				<span class='text'>A recent study has blamed the attempt on &quot;one of the intelligence agencies of the KMT</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tsang 766&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Public Education Center|Joseph Trento]] has also alleged that there was a second attempt on Zhou's life at the Bandung conference involving &quot;a bowl of rice poisoned with a slow-acting toxin</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Trento 10–11&lt;/ref&gt;According to one account based on recent research, Zhou found out about the bomb on the ''Kashmir Princess'' after being warned of the plot by his own intelligence officers and did not attempt to stop it because he viewed those that died as disposable: low-level cadres and international journalists</span>
				<span class='text'>After the crash, Zhou used the incident to warn the British about the KMT intelligence operatives active in Hong Kong and pressured Great Britain to disable the Nationalist intelligence network operating there (with himself playing a support role)</span>
				<span class='text'> He hoped that the incident would improve Britain's relationship with the PRC, and damage Britain's relationship with the ROC</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 156&lt;/ref&gt; The official explanation for Zhou's absence on the flight, however, remains that Zhou was forced to change his schedule due to having had surgery for appendicitis</span>

				<span class='text'>With the help of many of the nonaligned powers who had taken part in the conference, the US-backed position economically and politically boycotting the PRC began to erode, despite continuing American pressure to follow its direction</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1971, the United States finally gave up its opposition, and the PRC gained China's seat within the United Nations</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Spence 596&lt;/ref&gt;===Position on Taiwan==={{See also|One-China policy}}When the PRC was founded on 1 October 1949, Zhou notified all governments that any countries wishing to have diplomatic contact with the PRC must end their relationship with the leaders of the former regime on Taiwan, and support the PRC's claim to China's seat in the United Nations</span>
				<span class='text'>This was the first foreign policy document issued by the new government</span>
				<span class='text'> By 1950 the PRC was able to gain diplomatic relationships with other communist countries and with thirteen non-communist countries, but talks with most Western governments were unsuccessful</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 134&lt;/ref&gt;Zhou emerged from the Bandung conference with a reputation as a flexible and open-minded negotiator</span>
				<span class='text'> Recognizing that the United States would back the ''de facto'' independence of ROC-controlled Taiwan with military force, Zhou persuaded his government to end the shelling of [[Quemoy]] and [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]], and to search for a diplomatic alternative to the confrontation instead</span>
				<span class='text'> In a formal announcement in May 1955, Zhou declared that the PRC would &quot;strive for the liberation of Taiwan by peaceful means so far as it is possible</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Spence 528&lt;/ref&gt; Whenever the question of Taiwan was raised with foreign statesmen, Zhou argued that Taiwan was part of China, and that the resolution of the conflict with the Taiwan authorities was an internal matter</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 158&lt;/ref&gt;In 1958 the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs was passed to [[Chen Yi (communist)|Chen Yi]], a general with little prior diplomatic experience</span>
				<span class='text'> After Zhou resigned his office in Foreign Affairs, the PRC diplomatic corps was reduced dramatically</span>
				<span class='text'> Some were transferred to various cultural and educational departments to replace leading cadres who had been labelled [[Anti-Rightist Movement|&quot;rightists&quot;]] and sent to work in labour camps</span>

				<span class='text'>]By the early 1970s, [[Sino-American relations]] had begun to improve</span>
				<span class='text'>Mao's workers in the petroleum industry, one of China's few growing economic sectors at the time, advised the Chairman that, in order to consider growth at levels desired by the Party's leadership, large imports of American technology and technical expertise were essential</span>
				<span class='text'> In January 1970, the Chinese invited the American ping-pong team to tour China, initiating an era of &quot;[[ping-pong diplomacy]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Trade1&quot;&gt;Spence 597&lt;/ref&gt;In 1971, Zhou Enlai met secretly with President Nixon's security advisor, [[Henry Kissinger]], who had flown to China to prepare for a meeting between [[Richard Nixon]] and Mao Zedong</span>
				<span class='text'>During the course of these meetings, the United States agreed to allow the transfer of American money to China (presumably from relatives in the United States), to allow American-owned ships to conduct trade with China (under foreign flags), and to allow Chinese exports into the United States for the first time since the [[Korean War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>At the time, these negotiations were considered so sensitive that they were concealed from the American public, the State Department, the American secretary of state, and all foreign governments</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Trade1&quot; /&gt;On the morning of 21 February 1972, Richard Nixon arrived in Beijing, where he was greeted by Zhou, and later met with Mao Zedong</span>
				<span class='text'>The diplomatic substance of Nixon's visit was resolved on 28 February, in the [[Shanghai Communique]], which summarized both sides' positions without attempting to resolve them</span>
				<span class='text'>The &quot;US side&quot; reaffirmed the American position that America's involvement in the ongoing [[Vietnam War]] did not constitute &quot;outside intervention&quot; in Vietnam's affairs, and restated its commitment to &quot;individual freedom&quot;, and pledged continued support for South Korea</span>
				<span class='text'>The &quot;Chinese Side&quot; stated that &quot;wherever there is oppression, there is resistance&quot;, that &quot;all foreign troops should be withdrawn to their own countries&quot;, and that Korea should be unified according to the demands of [[North Korea]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Both sides agreed to disagree on the status of Taiwan</span>
				<span class='text'>The closing sections of the Shanghai Communique encouraged further diplomatic, cultural, economic, journalistic, and scientific exchanges, and endorsed both sides' intentions to work towards &quot;the relaxation of tensions in Asia and the world</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;  The resolutions of the Shanghai Communique represented a major policy shift for both the United States and China</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Spence 599–600&lt;/ref&gt;==The Great Leap Forward=={{Main|Great Leap Forward}}In 1958, Mao Zedong began the [[Great Leap Forward]], aimed at increasing China's production levels in industry and agriculture with unrealistic targets</span>
				<span class='text'>As a popular and practical administrator, Zhou maintained his position through the Leap</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou has been described by at least one historian as the &quot;midwife&quot; of the Great Leap Forward,&lt;ref&gt;Dikotter 448&lt;/ref&gt; turning Mao's theory into reality and in the process causing a &quot;minimum of 45 million&quot; deaths</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kingston&lt;/ref&gt;By the early 1960s, Mao's prestige was not as high as it had once been</span>
				<span class='text'> Mao's economic policies in the 1950s had failed, and he had developed a lifestyle that was increasingly out of touch with many of his oldest colleagues</span>
				<span class='text'>Among the activities that seemed contrary to his popular image were the swims in his private pool in [[Zhongnanhai]], his many villas around China that he would travel to on a private train, his private, book-lined study, and the companionship of an ever-changing succession of enthusiastic young women whom he met either on weekly dances in Zhongnanhai or on his journeys by train</span>
				<span class='text'>The combination of his personal eccentricities and public policy failures produced criticism from such veteran revolutionaries as [[Liu Shaoqi]], Deng Xiaoping, [[Chen Yun]], and Zhou Enlai, who seemed less and less to share an enthusiasm for his presence or his vision of continuous revolutionary struggle</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Spence 565&lt;/ref&gt;==The Cultural Revolution=={{Main|Cultural Revolution}}===Initial efforts of Mao and Lin===To improve his image and power, Mao, with the help of [[Lin Biao]], undertook a number of public propaganda efforts</span>
				<span class='text'>Among the efforts of Mao and Lin to improve Mao's image in the early 1960s were Lin's publication of the forged ''[[Diary of Lei Feng]]'' and his compilation of ''[[Quotations from Chairman Mao]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Spence 566&lt;/ref&gt;  The last and most successful of these efforts was the [[Cultural Revolution]]</span>
				<span class='text'>hatever its other causes, the Cultural Revolution, declared in 1966, was overtly pro-Maoist, and gave Mao the power and influence to purge the Party of his political enemies at the highest levels of government</span>
				<span class='text'>Along with closing China's schools and universities, its exhortations of young Chinese to destroy old buildings, temples, and art, and to attack their [[Revisionism (Marxism)|&quot;revisionist&quot;]] teachers, school administrators, party leaders, and parents</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;CR1&quot;&gt;Spence 575&lt;/ref&gt; After the Cultural Revolution was announced, many of the most senior members of the CCP who had shared Zhou's hesitation in following Mao's direction, including [[Liu Shaoqi]] and Deng Xiaoping, were removed from their posts almost immediately; and, with their families, subjected to mass criticism and humiliation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;CR1&quot; /&gt;===Political survival===Soon after they had been removed, Zhou argued that [[Liu Shaoqi]] and Deng Xiaoping &quot;should be allowed to come back to work&quot;, but this was opposed by Mao, [[Lin Biao]], [[Kang Sheng]] and [[Chen Boda]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Chen Boda even suggested that Zhou himself might be &quot;considered counter-revolutionary&quot; if he did not toe the Maoist line</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Dittmer 130–131&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the threats that he would share in the fate of his comrades if he did not support Mao, Zhou ceased his criticisms and began to work more closely with the Chairman and his clique</span>
				<span class='text'>hou gave his backing to the establishment of radical [[Red Guards (People's Republic of China)|Red Guard]] organizations in October, 1966 and joined [[Chen Boda]] and [[Jiang Qing]] against what they considered &quot;leftist&quot; and &quot;rightist&quot; Red Guard factions</span>
				<span class='text'>This opened the way for attacks on Liu Shaoqi, Deng Xiaoping, and [[Tao Zhu]] in December 1966 and January 1967</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Dittmer 142–143&lt;/ref&gt; By September 1968, Zhou candidly described his strategy for political survival to Japanese LDP parliamentarians visiting Beijing: &quot;one’s personal opinions should advance or beat a retreat according to the direction of the majority</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dittmer 144–145&lt;/ref&gt; When he was accused of being less than enthusiastic in following Mao's leadership, he accused himself of &quot;poor understanding&quot; of Mao's theories, giving the appearance of compromising with forces that he secretly loathed and referred to in private as his &quot;inferno&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 4–5&lt;/ref&gt; Following the logic of political survival, Zhou worked to aid Mao, and restricted his criticisms to private conversations</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough Zhou escaped being directly persecuted, he was not able to save many of those closest to him from having their lives destroyed by the Cultural Revolution</span>
				<span class='text'>Sun Weishi, Zhou's adopted daughter, died in 1968 after seven months of torture and imprisonment by Maoist [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After the end of the Cultural Revolution, Sun's plays were re-staged as a way of criticizing the [[Gang of Four]], whom many thought were responsible for her death</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Li and Ho 500&lt;/ref&gt;Throughout the next decade, Mao largely developed policies while Zhou carried them out, attempting to moderate some of the excesses of the Cultural Revolution (such as preventing Beijing from being renamed &quot;[[The East Is Red (song)|East Is Red]] City&quot; and the [[Chinese guardian lions]] in front of [[Tian'anmen Square]] from being replaced with statues of Mao&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mao's Last Revolution|first=Roderick|last=Macfarquhar|first2=Michael|last2=Schoenhals|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2008|pages=118–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;)</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite his best efforts, the inability to prevent many of the events of the Cultural Revolution were a great blow to Zhou</span>
				<span class='text'>Over the last decade of his life, Zhou's ability to implement Mao's policies and keep the nation afloat during periods of adversity was so great that his practical importance alone was sufficient to save him (with Mao's assistance) whenever Zhou became politically threatened</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pagefive1&quot;/&gt; At the latest stages of the Cultural Revolution, in 1975, Zhou pushed for the &quot;[[Four Modernizations]]&quot; in order to undo the damage caused by the Mao's policies</span>
				<span class='text'>uring the later stages of the Cultural Revolution, Zhou became a target of political campaigns orchestrated by Chairman Mao and the [[Gang of Four]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The &quot;[[Criticize Lin, Criticize Confucius]]&quot; campaign of 1973 and 1974 was directed at Premier Zhou because he was viewed as one of the Gang's primary political opponents</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1975, Zhou's enemies initiated a campaign named &quot;Criticizing [[Song Jiang]], Evaluating ''the [[Water Margin]]''&quot;, which encouraged the use of Zhou as an example of a political loser</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bonavia 24&lt;/ref&gt;==Death and reactions=====Illness and death===According to the recent biography of Zhou by Gao Wenqian, Zhou was first diagnosed with bladder cancer in 1972</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gao 235&lt;/ref&gt;  Zhou's medical team reported that with treatment he had an 80–90 percent chance of recovery, but medical treatment for the highest ranking party members had to be approved by Mao</span>
				<span class='text'>Mao ordered that Zhou and his wife should not be told of the diagnosis, no surgery should be performed, and no further examinations should be given</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gao, 235–236&lt;/ref&gt; By 1974, Zhou was experiencing significant bleeding in his urine</span>
				<span class='text'> After pressure by other leaders who had learned of Zhou's condition, an operation was finally performed in June 1974, but the bleeding returned a few months later, indicating metastasis of the cancer into other organs</span>
				<span class='text'> A series of operations over the next year and a half failed to check the progress of the cancer</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gao 260–262, 275–276, 296–297&lt;/ref&gt; Zhou continued to conduct work during his stays in the hospital, with Deng Xiaoping, as the First Deputy Premier, handling most of the important State Council matters</span>

				<span class='text'>620&quot;/&gt;Instead, Mao attacked a proposal to have Zhou publicly declared a great Marxist, and rejected a request that he make a brief appearance at Zhou's funeral, instructing his nephew, [[Mao Yuanxin]], to explain that he could not attend because doing so would be seen as a public admission that he was being forced to &quot;rethink the Cultural Revolution&quot;, as Zhou's later years had been closely associated with reversing and moderating its excesses</span>
				<span class='text'> Mao worried that public expressions of mourning would later be directed against him and his policies, and backed the &quot;five nos&quot; campaign to suppress public expressions of mourning for Zhou after the late Premier's death</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Teiwes and Sun 217–218&lt;/ref&gt;===Memorial===Whatever Mao's opinion of Zhou may have been, there was general mourning among the public</span>
				<span class='text'>Foreign correspondents reported that Beijing, shortly after Zhou's death, looked like a ghost town</span>
				<span class='text'>There was no burial ceremony, as Zhou had willed his ashes to be scattered across the hills and rivers of his hometown, rather than stored in a ceremonial mausoleum</span>
				<span class='text'>With Zhou gone, it became clear how the Chinese people had revered him, and how they had viewed him as a symbol of stability in an otherwise chaotic period of history</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Spence 610–611&lt;/ref&gt; Zhou's death also brought condolences from nations around the world</span>
				<span class='text'>ice-Premier Deng Xiaoping delivered the eulogy at Zhou's state funeral on 15 January 1976</span>
				<span class='text'> Although much of his speech echoed the wording of an official statement by the Central Committee immediately following Zhou's death or consisted of a meticulous description of Zhou's remarkable political career, near the end of the eulogy he offered a personal tribute to Zhou's character, speaking from the heart while observing the rhetoric demanded of ceremonial state occasions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Eulogy1&quot;&gt;Spence 611&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to Zhou, Deng stated that:&lt;blockquote&gt;He was open and aboveboard, paid attention to the interests of the whole, observed Party discipline, was strict in &quot;dissecting&quot; himself and good at uniting the mass of cadres, and upheld the unity and solidarity of the Party</span>
				<span class='text'>He maintained broad and close ties with the masses and showed boundless warmheartedness towards all comrades and the people</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> We should learn from his fine style – being modest and prudent, unassuming and approachable, setting an example by his conduct, and living in a plain and hard-working way</span>
				<span class='text'>We should follow his example of adhering to the proletarian style and opposing the bourgeois style of life&lt;ref name=&quot;Eulogy1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Spence believed this statement was interpreted at the time as a subtle criticism of Mao and the other leaders of the Cultural Revolution, who could not possibly be viewed or praised as being &quot;open and aboveboard&quot;, &quot;good at uniting the mass of cadres&quot;, for displaying &quot;warmheartedness&quot;, or for modesty, prudence, or approachability</span>
				<span class='text'>Regardless of Deng's intentions, the Gang of Four, and later [[Hua Guofeng]], increased the persecution of Deng shortly after he delivered this eulogy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Eulogy1&quot; /&gt;===Suppression of public mourning===After Zhou's single official memorial ceremony on 15 January, Zhou's political enemies within the Party officially prohibited any further displays of public mourning</span>
				<span class='text'> The most notorious regulations prohibiting Zhou from being honoured were the poorly observed and poorly enforced &quot;five nos&quot;: no wearing black armbands, no mourning wreaths, no mourning halls, no memorial activities, and no handing out photos of Zhou</span>
				<span class='text'> Years of resentment over the Cultural Revolution, the public persecution of Deng Xiaoping (who was strongly associated with Zhou in public perception), and the prohibition against publicly mourning Zhou became associated with each other shortly after Zhou's death, leading to popular discontent against Mao and his apparent successors (notably [[Hua Guofeng]] and the Gang of Four)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;TS1&quot;&gt;Teiwes and Sun 213&lt;/ref&gt;Official attempts to enforce the &quot;five nos&quot; included removing public memorials and tearing down posters commemorating his achievements</span>
				<span class='text'> On 25 March 1976, a leading Shanghai newspaper, ''Wenhui Bao'', published an article stating that Zhou was &quot;the capitalist roader inside the Party [who] wanted to help the unrepentant capitalist roader [Deng] regain his power&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>This and other propaganda efforts to attack Zhou's image only strengthened the public's attachment to Zhou's memory</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Teiwes and Sun 214&lt;/ref&gt; Between March and April 1976, a forged document circulated in [[Nanjing]] that claimed itself to be Zhou Enlai's last will</span>
				<span class='text'> It attacked [[Jiang Qing]] and praised Deng Xiaoping, and was met with increased propaganda efforts by the government</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Teiwes and Sun 222&lt;/ref&gt;===The Tiananmen incident==={{Main|Tiananmen Incident}}Within several months after the death of Zhou, one of the most extraordinary spontaneous events in the history of the PRC occurred</span>
				<span class='text'> On 4 April 1976, at the eve of China's annual [[Qingming Festival]], in which Chinese traditionally pay homage to their deceased ancestors, thousands of people gathered around the [[Monument to the People's Heroes]] in [[Tiananmen Square]] to commemorate the life and death of Zhou Enlai</span>
				<span class='text'>On this occasion, the people of Beijing honoured Zhou by laying wreaths, banners, poems, placards, and flowers at the foot of the Monument</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Tiananmen1&quot; /&gt; The most obvious purpose of this memorial was to eulogize Zhou, but Jiang Qing, [[Zhang Chunqiao]], and [[Yao Wenyuan]] were also attacked for their alleged evil actions against the Premier</span>
				<span class='text'>A small number of slogans left at Tiananmen even attacked Mao himself, and his Cultural Revolution</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name= &quot;TS2&quot;&gt;Teiwes and Sun 218&lt;/ref&gt;Up to two million people may have visited Tiananmen Square on 4 April</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;TS2&quot; /&gt; First-hand observations of the events in Tiananmen Square on 4 April report that all levels of society, from the poorest peasants to high-ranking PLA officers and the children of high-ranking cadres, were represented in the activities</span>
				<span class='text'>Those who participated were motivated by a mixture of anger over the treatment of Zhou, revolt against Mao and his policies, apprehension for China's future, and defiance of those who would seek to punish the public for commemorating Zhou's memory</span>
				<span class='text'>There is nothing to suggest that events were coordinated from any position of leadership: it was a spontaneous demonstration reflecting widespread public sentiment</span>
				<span class='text'>Deng Xiaoping was notably absent, and he instructed his children to avoid being seen at the square</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Teiwes and Sun 119–220&lt;/ref&gt;On the morning of 5 April, crowds gathering around the memorial arrived to discover that it had been completely removed by the police during the night, angering them</span>
				<span class='text'>Attempts to suppress the mourners led to a violent riot, in which police cars were set on fire and a crowd of over 100,000 people forced its way into several government buildings surrounding the square</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Tiananmen1&quot;&gt;Spence 612&lt;/ref&gt;By 6:00 pm, most of the crowd had dispersed, but a small group remained until 10:00 pm, when a security force entered Tiananmen Square and arrested them</span>
				<span class='text'> (The reported figure of those arrested was 388 people, but was rumored to be far higher</span>
				<span class='text'> Many of those arrested were later sentenced to &quot;people's trial&quot; at [[Peking University]], or were sentenced to prison work camps</span>
				<span class='text'>Incidents similar to those which occurred in Beijing on 4 and 5 April occurred in [[Zhengzhou]], [[Kunming]], [[Taiyuan]], [[Changchun]], [[Shanghai]], [[Wuhan]], and [[Guangzhou]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Possibly because of his close association with Zhou, Deng Xiaoping was formally stripped of all positions &quot;inside and outside the Party&quot; on 7 April, following this &quot;[[Tiananmen Incident]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Tiananmen1&quot; /&gt;After ousting [[Hua Guofeng]] and assuming control of China in 1980, Deng Xiaoping released those arrested in the Tiananmen Incident as part of a broader effort to reverse the effects of the Cultural Revolution</span>
				<span class='text'>=Legacy==By the end of his lifetime, Zhou was widely viewed as representing moderation and justice in Chinese popular culture</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;TS1&quot; /&gt; Since his death, Zhou Enlai has been regarded as a skilled negotiator, a master of policy implementation, a devoted revolutionary, and a pragmatic statesman with an unusual attentiveness to detail and nuance</span>
				<span class='text'>He was also known for his tireless and dedicated work ethic, and his unusual charm and poise in public</span>
				<span class='text'>He was reputedly the last Mandarin bureaucrat in the Confucian tradition</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhou's political behaviour should be viewed in light of his political philosophy as well as his personality</span>
				<span class='text'>To a large extent, Zhou epitomized the paradox inherent in a Communist politician with traditional Chinese upbringing: at once conservative and radical, pragmatic and ideological, possessed by a belief in order and harmony as well as a faith, which he developed very gradually over time, in the progressive power of rebellion and revolution</span>
				<span class='text'>hough a firm believer in the Communist ideal on which the People's Republic was founded, Zhou is widely believed to have moderated the excesses of Mao's radical policies within the limits of his power</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Deng Xiaoping was quoted as saying Zhou was &quot;'sometimes forced to act against his conscience in order to minimize the damage&quot; stemming from Mao's policies</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;While many earlier Chinese leaders today have been subjected to criticism inside China, Zhou's image has remained positive among contemporary Chinese</span>
				<span class='text'>Many Chinese continue to venerate Zhou as possibly the most humane leader of the 20th century, and the CCP today promotes Zhou as a dedicated and self-sacrificing leader who remains a symbol of the Communist Party</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name =&quot;Pagefour1&quot;&gt;Barnouin and Yu 4&lt;/ref&gt;  Even historians who list Mao's faults generally attribute the opposite qualities to Zhou: Zhou was cultured where Mao was crude; consistent where Mao was unstable; stoic where Mao was paranoid</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ritter1&quot;&gt;Ritter&lt;/ref&gt;However, recent academic criticism of Zhou has focused on his late relationship with Mao, and his political activities during the Cultural Revolution, arguing that the relationship between Zhou and Mao may have been more complex than is commonly portrayed</span>
				<span class='text'> Zhou has been depicted as unconditionally submissive and loyal to Mao and his allies, going out of his way to support or permit the persecution of friends and relatives in order to avoid facing political condemnation himself</span>
				<span class='text'>After the founding of the PRC, Zhou was unable or unwilling to protect the former spies that he had employed in the Chinese Civil War and the Second World War, who were persecuted for their wartime contacts with the enemies of the CCP</span>
				<span class='text'>Early in the Cultural Revolution, he told Jiang Qing &quot;From now on you make all the decisions, and I'll make sure they're carried out,&quot; and publicly declared that his old colleague, [[Liu Shaoqi]], &quot;deserved to die&quot; for opposing Mao</span>
				<span class='text'>In the effort to avoid being persecuted for opposing Mao, Zhou passively accepted the political persecution of many others, including his own brother</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ritter1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sun 143–144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barnoun and Yu 87&lt;/ref&gt;A popular saying within China once compared Zhou to a ''budaoweng'' (a [[Roly-poly toy|tumbler]]), which can imply that he was a political opportunist</span>
				<span class='text'>Some observers have criticized him as being too diplomatic: avoiding clear stands in complex political situations and instead becoming ideologically elusive, ambiguous, and enigmatic</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pagefour1&quot; /&gt; Several explanations have been offered to explain his elusiveness</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Tsoi Wing-Mui, a magazine editor in Hong Kong, suggested in her 2015 book &quot;The Secret Emotional Life of Zhou Enlai&quot; that Zhou may have been a homosexual and feared &quot;being ruined&quot; if this was publicly revealed</span>
				<span class='text'>While Tsoi does not give absolute proof for it, her claim is based on an analysis of Zhou's personal diaries and his biography that is contained</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Zhou Enlai: A Biography|last = Wilson|first = Dick|publisher = Viking|year = 1984|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This explanation for Zhou's elusiveness was also widely accepted by many Chinese after his death</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Wilson also writes that Zhou &quot;would have been hounded out of his position of influence, removed from control of the Government&quot; were he to &quot;make a stand and demand that Mao call off the campaign or bring the Red Guards to heel</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; Zhou's involvement in the Cultural Revolution is thus defended by many on the grounds that he had no choice other than political martyrdom</span>
				<span class='text'>Due to his influence and political ability, the entire government may have collapsed without his cooperation</span>
				<span class='text'>Given the political circumstances of the last decade of Zhou's life, it is unlikely that he would have survived a purge without cultivating the support of Mao through active assistance</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pagefive1&quot;&gt;Barnouin and Yu 5&lt;/ref&gt;Zhou received a great deal of praise from American statesmen who met him in 1971</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Henry Kissinger]] wrote that he had been extremely impressed with Zhou's intelligence and character, describing him as &quot;equally at home in philosophy, reminiscence, historical analysis, tactical probes, humorous repartee</span>
				<span class='text'></span>

				<span class='text'>quot; Kissinger called Zhou &quot;one of the two or three most impressive men I have ever met,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kissinger&lt;/ref&gt; stating that &quot;his commands of facts, in particular his knowledge of American events and, for that matter, of my own background, was stunning</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pagefive1&quot; /&gt;Zhou remains a widely commemorated figure in China today</span>
				<span class='text'>After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Zhou ordered his hometown of [[Huai'an]] not to transform his house into a memorial and not to keep up the Zhou family tombs</span>
				<span class='text'>These orders were respected within Zhou's lifetime, but today his family home and traditional family school have been restored, and are visited by a large number of tourists every year</span>
				<span class='text'> In 1998, Huai'an, in order to commemorate Zhou's one hundredth birthday, opened a vast commemorative park with a museum dedicated to his life</span>
				<span class='text'>The park includes a reproduction of [[Xihuating]], Zhou's living and working quarters in Beijing</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Nanjing Meiyuan New Village Memorial Hall''&lt;/ref&gt; Stamps commemorating the first anniversary of Zhou's death were issued in 1977, and in 1998 to commemorate his 100th birthday</span>
