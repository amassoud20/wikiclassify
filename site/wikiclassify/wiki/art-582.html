				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; On 2 March 1390, Zheng He accompanied Zhu Di when he commanded his first expedition, which was a great victory as the Mongol commander [[Naghachu]] surrendered as soon as he realized he had fallen for a deception</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Levathes 1996, 64–66</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Eventually, he would gain the confidence and trust of the prince</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The young eunuch eventually became a trusted adviser to the prince and assisted him when the [[Jianwen Emperor]]'s hostility to his uncle's feudal bases prompted the 1399{{ndash}}1402 [[Jingnan Campaign]] which ended with the emperor's apparent death and the ascension of the Zhu Di, Prince of Yan, as the [[Yongle Emperor]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1393, the Crown Prince had died, thus the deceased prince's son became the new heir apparent</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=dr7-19/&gt; By the time the emperor died (24 June 1398), the Prince of Qin and the Prince of Jin had perished, which left Zhu Di, the Prince of Yan, as the eldest surviving son of the emperor</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=dr7-19&gt;Dreyer 2007, 19</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; However, Zhu Di's nephew succeeded the imperial throne as the [[Jianwen Emperor]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=dr7-20&gt;Dreyer 2007, 20&lt;/ref&gt; In 1398, he issued a policy known as ''xiaofan'', &quot;reducing the feudatories&quot;, which entails eliminating all the princes by stripping their power and military forces</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Levathes 1996, 67</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In August 1399, Zhu Di openly rebelled against his nephew</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=dr7-21&gt;Dreyer 2007, 21</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=lev6-70&gt;Levathes 1996, 70</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Zheng He would be one of his commanders during this campaign</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=dr7-21-2&gt;Dreyer 2007, 21–22</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Chinese New Year|New Year]]'s day on 11 February 1404,&lt;ref name=dr7-22-3/&gt; the Yongle Emperor conferred the surname &quot;Zheng&quot; to him (his original name was still Ma He), because he had distinguished himself defending the city reservoir Zhenglunba against imperial forces in the Siege of Beiping of 1399,&lt;ref name=dr7-22-3&gt;Dreyer 2007, 22–23</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lev6-72-3&gt;Levathes 1997, 72–73</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=lev6-72-3/&gt; It is believed that his choice to confer the surname &quot;Zheng&quot; was because the eunuch's horse had been killed during the battle at Zhenglunba near Beiping at the onset of his rebellion</span>

				<span class='text'>]===Imperial China===In the decades after the last voyage, Imperial officials minimized the importance of Zheng He and his expeditions throughout the many regnal and dynastic histories they compiled</span>
				<span class='text'>The information in the [[Ming Taizong Shilu|Yongle]] and [[Ming Xuanzong Shilu|Xuande Emperors' official annals]] was incomplete and even erroneous; other official publications omitted them completely</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;HMZX&quot;/&gt; Although some have seen this as a conspiracy seeking to eliminate memories of the voyages,&lt;ref name=&quot;heyhei&quot;/&gt; it is likely that the records were dispersed throughout several departments and the expeditions {{ndash}} unauthorized by (and in fact, counter to) the [[Huang Ming Zu Xun|injunctions of the dynastic founder]] {{ndash}} presented a kind of embarrassment to the dynasty</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;HMZX&quot;/&gt;State-sponsored Ming naval efforts declined dramatically after Zheng's voyages</span>
				<span class='text'>Starting in the early 15th century, China experienced increasing pressure from the [[Northern Yuan dynasty|surviving Yuan Mongols]] from the north</span>
				<span class='text'>The relocation of the capital north to Beijing exacerbated this threat dramatically</span>
				<span class='text'>At considerable expense, China launched annual military expeditions from Beijing to weaken the Mongolians</span>
				<span class='text'>The expenditures necessary for these land campaigns directly competed with the funds necessary to continue naval expeditions</span>
				<span class='text'>Further, in 1449, Mongolian cavalry ambushed a land expedition personally led by the [[Zhengtong Emperor]] at [[Battle of Tumu Fortress|Tumu Fortress]], less than a day's march from the walls of the capital</span>
				<span class='text'>The Mongolians wiped out the Chinese army and captured the emperor</span>
				<span class='text'>This battle had two salient effects</span>
				<span class='text'>First, it demonstrated the clear threat posed by the northern nomads</span>
				<span class='text'>Second, the Mongols caused a political crisis in China when they released the emperor after his half-brother had already ascended and declared the new [[Jingtai Emperor|Jingtai era]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Not until 1457 and the restoration of the former emperor did political stability return</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon his return to power, China abandoned the strategy of annual land expeditions and instead embarked upon a massive and expensive expansion of the [[Great Wall of China]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In this environment, funding for naval expeditions simply did not happen</span>
				<span class='text'>owever, missions from Southeast Asia continued to arrive for decades</span>
				<span class='text'>Depending on local conditions, they could reach such frequency that the court found it necessary to restrict them: the ''[[History of Ming]]'' records imperial edicts forbidding Java, Champa, and Siam from sending their envoys more often than once every three years</span>

				<span class='text'>However, the ban on maritime shipping did force countless numbers of people into smuggling and [[wokou|piracy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Neglect of the imperial navy and Nanjing dockyards after Zheng He's voyages left the coast highly vulnerable to Japanese [[Wokou]] during the 16th century</span>

				<span class='text'>quot; This &quot;narrative emphasizes the failure&quot; instead of the accomplishments, despite his assertion that &quot;Zheng He reshaped Asia</span>
