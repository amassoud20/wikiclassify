				<span class='text'>I'd loosen up, three, four minutes</span>
				<span class='text'>Five at the outside</span>
				<span class='text'>And I never went to the bullpen</span>
				<span class='text'>Oh, I'd relieve all right, plenty of times, but I went right from the bench to the box, and I'd take a few warm-up pitches and be ready</span>
				<span class='text'>Then I had good control</span>
