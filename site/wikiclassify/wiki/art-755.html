				<span class='text'>Instrumental in forging a distinctly American style of composition, in his later years he was often referred to as &quot;the Dean of American Composers&quot; and is best known to the public for the works he wrote in the 1930s and 1940s in a deliberately accessible style often referred to as &quot;populist&quot; and which the composer labeled his &quot;vernacular&quot; style</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pollack|1999|p=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Works in this vein include the ballets ''[[Appalachian Spring]]'', ''[[Billy the Kid (ballet)|Billy the Kid]]'' and ''[[Rodeo (Copland)|Rodeo]]'', his ''[[Fanfare for the Common Man]]'' and [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>3 (Copland)|Third Symphony]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The open, slowly changing harmonies of many of his works are archetypical of what many people consider to be the sound of American music, evoking the vast American landscape and pioneer spirit</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition to his ballets and orchestral works, he produced music in many other genres including chamber music, vocal works, opera and film scores</span>
				<span class='text'>fter some initial studies with composer [[Rubin Goldmark]], Copland traveled to Paris, where he studied at first with [[Isidor Philipp]] and [[Paul Vidal]], then with noted pedagogue [[Nadia Boulanger]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He studied three years with Boulanger, whose eclectic approach to music inspired his own broad taste in that area</span>
				<span class='text'>Determined upon his return to the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>to make his way as a full-time composer, Copland gave lecture-recitals, wrote works on commission and did some teaching and writing</span>
				<span class='text'>He found composing orchestral music in the &quot;modernist&quot; style he had adapted abroad a financially contradictory approach, particularly in light of the [[Great Depression]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He shifted in the mid-1930s to a more accessible musical style which mirrored the German idea of ''[[Gebrauchsmusik]]'' (&quot;music for use&quot;), music that could serve utilitarian and artistic purposes</span>
				<span class='text'>During the Depression years, he traveled extensively to Europe, Africa, and Mexico, formed an important friendship with Mexican composer [[Carlos Chávez]] and began composing his signature works</span>
				<span class='text'>uring the late 1940s, Copland felt a need to compose works of greater emotional substance than his utilitarian scores of the late 1930s and early 1940s</span>
				<span class='text'> He was aware that [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]], as well as many fellow composers, had begun to study [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s use of [[Twelve-tone technique|twelve-tone (serial) techniques]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In his personal style, Copland began to make use of twelve-tone rows in several compositions</span>
				<span class='text'>He incorporated serial techniques in some of his later works{{Clarify|date=September 2013}}&lt;!--Apart from twelve-tone rows, what serial techniques did Copland use at this time?--&gt;, including his Piano Quartet (1951), Piano Fantasy (1957), ''[[Connotations (Copland)|Connotations]]'' for orchestra (1961) and ''Inscape'' for orchestra (1967)</span>
				<span class='text'>From the 1960s onward, Copland's activities turned more from composing to conducting</span>
				<span class='text'>He became a frequent guest conductor of orchestras in the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>and the UK and made a series of recordings of his music, primarily for [[Columbia Records]]</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Aaron Copland School of Music, Queens College (part of the City University of New York)]]Aaron Copland was born in [[Brooklyn]] into a [[Conservative Jewish]] family of [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian]] origins, the last of five children, on November 14, 1900</span>
				<span class='text'>While emigrating from Russia to the United States, Copland's father, Harris Morris Copland, [[Anglicisation|Anglicized]] his surname &quot;''Kaplan''&quot; to &quot;''Copland''&quot; while living and working in Scotland for two to three years to pay for the boat fare to the US</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and most of the children helped out in the store</span>
				<span class='text'>His father was a staunch Democrat</span>
				<span class='text'>The family members were active in [[Congregation Baith Israel Anshei Emes]], where Aaron celebrated his [[Bar Mitzvah]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>26&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Pollack|1999|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not especially athletic, the sensitive young man became an avid reader and often read [[Horatio Alger]] stories on his front steps</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Smith, p</span>
				<span class='text'>5</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Copland's father had no musical interest at all, but his mother, Sarah Mittenthal Copland, sang and played the piano, and arranged for music lessons for her children</span>
				<span class='text'>Of his siblings, oldest brother Ralph was the most advanced musically, proficient on the violin, while his sister Laurine had the strongest connection with Aaron, giving him his first piano lessons, promoting his musical education, and supporting him in his musical career</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pollack|1999|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attended the Metropolitan Opera School and was a frequent opera goer</span>
				<span class='text'>She often brought home [[libretti]] for Aaron to study</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Smith, p</span>
				<span class='text'>7</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Copland attended Boys' High School and in the summer went to various camps</span>
				<span class='text'>Most of his early exposure to music was at Jewish weddings and ceremonies, and occasional family musicales</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>26&quot;/&gt;At the age of eleven, Copland devised an opera scenario he called ''Zenatello'', which included seven bars of music, his first notated melody</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pollack|1999|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1913 to 1917 he took music lessons with Leopold Wolfsohn, who taught him the standard classical fare</span>
				<span class='text'>Copland's first public music performance was at a [[Wanamaker's]] recital</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Smith, p</span>
				<span class='text'>8</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;By the age of 15, after attending a concert by composer-pianist [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]], Copland decided to become a composer</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pollack|1999|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; After attempts to further his music study from a [[correspondence course]], Copland took formal lessons in [[harmony]], [[music theory|theory]], and [[Musical composition|composition]] from [[Rubin Goldmark]], a noted teacher and composer of American music (who had given [[George Gershwin]] three lessons)</span>
				<span class='text'>Goldmark gave the young Copland a solid foundation, especially in the Germanic tradition, as he stated later: &quot;This was a stroke of luck for me</span>
				<span class='text'>I was spared the floundering that so many musicians have suffered through incompetent teaching</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p</span>
				<span class='text'>3</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; But Copland also commented that the maestro had &quot;little sympathy for the advanced musical idioms of the day&quot; and his &quot;approved&quot; composers ended with [[Richard Strauss]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pollack|1999|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;Copland's graduation piece from his studies with Goldmark was a three-movement piano [[sonata]] in a [[Romantic music|Romantic style]]</span>
				<span class='text'>But he had also composed more original and daring pieces which he did not share with his teacher</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pollack|1999|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to regularly attending the [[Metropolitan Opera]] and the [[New York Symphony]], where he heard the standard classical repertory, Copland continued his musical development through an expanding circle of musical friends</span>
				<span class='text'>After graduating from high school, Copland played in dance bands</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pollack|1999|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing his musical education, he received further piano lessons from Victor Wittgenstein, who found his student to be &quot;quiet, shy, well-mannered, and gracious in accepting criticism</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p</span>
				<span class='text'>5,31</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Copland's fascination with the [[October Revolution|Russian Revolution]] and its promise for freeing the lower classes drew a rebuke from his father and uncles</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Smith, p</span>
				<span class='text'>30&quot;&gt;Smith, p</span>
				<span class='text'>0</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In spite of that, in his early adult life Copland would develop friendships with people with socialist and communist leanings</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pollack|1999|p=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;===Studying in Paris===[[File:Nadia Boulanger 1925</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Nadia Boulanger in 1925]]From 1917 to 1921, Copland composed juvenile works of short piano pieces and art songs</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollack, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>33–5&lt;/ref&gt; Copland's passion for the latest European music, plus glowing letters from his friend Aaron Schaffer, inspired him to go to Paris for further study</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Smith, p</span>
				<span class='text'>33&lt;/ref&gt; His father wanted him to go to college, but his mother's vote in the family conference allowed him to give Paris a try</span>
				<span class='text'>On arriving in France, he studied at the [[Fontainebleau School of Music]] with noted pianist and pedagogue [[Isidor Philipp]] and with Paul Vidal</span>
				<span class='text'>But finding Vidal too much like Goldmark, Copland switched to famed teacher [[Nadia Boulanger]], then aged thirty-four</span>
				<span class='text'>He had initial reservations: &quot;No one to my knowledge had ever before thought of studying with a woman</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p</span>
				<span class='text'>41&lt;/ref&gt; She interviewed him, and recalled later: &quot;One could tell his talent immediately</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>41&quot;&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>41&lt;/ref&gt;Boulanger had as many as forty students at once and employed a formal regimen that Copland had to follow, too</span>
				<span class='text'>Copland found her incisive mind much to his liking and stated: &quot;This intellectual Amazon is not only professor at the [[Conservatoire de Paris|Conservatoire]], is not only familiar with all music from Bach to Stravinsky, but is prepared for anything worse in the way of dissonance</span>
				<span class='text'>But make no mistake&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>A more charming womanly woman never lived</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>47&lt;/ref&gt; Though he planned on only one year abroad, he studied with her for three years, finding her eclectic approach inspired his own broad musical taste</span>
				<span class='text'>dding to the heady cultural atmosphere of the early 1920s in Paris was the presence of expatriate American writers [[Paul Bowles]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Sinclair Lewis]], [[Gertrude Stein]], and [[Ezra Pound]], as well as artists like [[Picasso]], [[Chagall]], and [[Amedeo Modigliani|Modigliani]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>51&lt;/ref&gt; Also influential on the new music were the French intellectuals [[Marcel Proust]], [[Paul Valéry]], [[Sartre]], and [[André Gide]], the latter cited by Copland as being his personal favorite and most read</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollack, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>53–4&lt;/ref&gt; Travels to Italy, Austria, and Germany rounded out Copland's musical education</span>
				<span class='text'>During his stay in Paris, Copland began writing musical critiques, the first on [[Gabriel Fauré]], which helped spread his fame and stature in the music community</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Smith, p</span>
				<span class='text'>62&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of wallowing in self-pity and self-destruction like many of the expatriate members of the [[Lost Generation]], Copland returned to America optimistic and enthusiastic about the future</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>55&lt;/ref&gt;===1925 to 1950===Upon returning to the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> Copland was determined to make his way as a full-time composer</span>
				<span class='text'>He rented a studio apartment on New York City's [[Upper West Side]] in the [[The Empire Hotel (New York City)|Empire Hotel]], which kept him close to Carnegie Hall and other musical venues and publishers</span>
				<span class='text'>He remained in that area for the next thirty years, later moving to Westchester County, New York</span>
				<span class='text'>Copland lived frugally and survived financially with help from two $2,500 [[Guggenheim Fellowship]]s—one in 1925 and one in 1926</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pollack|1999|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lecture-recitals, awards, appointments, and small commissions, plus some teaching, writing, and personal loans kept him afloat in the subsequent years through World War II</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>90&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Pollack|1999|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also important were wealthy patrons who supported the arts community during the Depression, underwriting performances, publication, and promotion of musical events and composers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>90&quot;/&gt;Copland's compositions in the early 1920s reflected the prevailing &quot;modernist&quot; attitude among intellectuals: that they were a small vanguard leading the way for the masses, who would only come to appreciate their efforts over time</span>
				<span class='text'>In this view, music and the other arts need be accessible to only a select cadre of the enlightened</span>
				<span class='text'>Toward this end, Copland formed the Young Composer's Group, modeled after France's [[Les Six|&quot;Six&quot;]], gathering together promising young composers, acting as their guiding spirit</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berger|first=Arthur|title=Aaron Copland|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;Soon after his return, Copland was introduced to the artistic circle of [[Alfred Stieglitz]] and met many of the leading artists of that time</span>
				<span class='text'>Stieglitz's conviction that the American artist should reflect &quot;the ideas of American Democracy&quot; influenced Copland and a whole generation of artists and photographers, including [[Paul Strand]], [[Edward Weston]], [[Ansel Adams]], [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], and [[Walker Evans]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pollack|1999|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evans' photographs inspired portions of Copland's opera ''The Tender Land''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pollack|1999|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;In his quest to take up Stieglitz's challenge, Copland had few established American contemporaries to emulate apart from [[Carl Ruggles]] and the reclusive [[Charles Ives]], although the 1920s were Golden Years for American popular music and jazz, with [[George Gershwin]], [[Bessie Smith]], and [[Louis Armstrong]] leading the way</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pollack|1999|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, however, Copland joined up with his younger contemporaries and formed a group termed the &quot;commando unit,&quot; which included [[Roger Sessions]], [[Roy Harris]], [[Virgil Thomson]], and [[Walter Piston]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pollack|1999|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; They collaborated in joint concerts showcasing their work to new audiences</span>
				<span class='text'>opland's relationship with the &quot;commando unit&quot; was one of both support and rivalry, and he played a key role in keeping them together</span>
				<span class='text'>The five young American composers helped promote each other and their works but also had testy exchanges, inflamed by the assertion of the press that Copland was the &quot;truly American&quot; composer</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pollack|1999|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Going beyond the five, Copland was generous with his time with nearly every American young composer he met during his life, later earning the title the &quot;Dean of American Music</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pollack|1999|pp=178, 215}}&lt;/ref&gt;Mounting troubles with the ''Symphonic Ode'' (1929) and ''Short Symphony'' (1933) caused him to rethink the paradigm of composing orchestral music for a select group, as it was a financially contradictory approach, particularly in the Depression</span>
				<span class='text'>In many ways, this shift mirrored the German idea of [[Gebrauchsmusik]] (&quot;music for use&quot;), as composers sought to create music that could serve a utilitarian as well as artistic purpose</span>
				<span class='text'>This approach encompassed two trends: first, music that students could easily learn, and second, music which would have wider appeal, such as incidental music for plays, movies, radio, etc</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Smith, p</span>
				<span class='text'>162&lt;/ref&gt; Copland undertook both goals, starting in the mid-1930s</span>
				<span class='text'>{listen| filename     = Aron_Copland_Appalachian_Spring_Opening_original_version_for_13_instruments</span>
				<span class='text'>gg| title        = Opening: Appalachian Spring, original version for 13 instruments| description  = Sample of the opening movement in Copland's ballet| format       = [[Ogg]]}}Perhaps motivated by the plight of children during the Depression, around 1935 Copland began to compose musical pieces for young audiences, in accordance with the first goal of American Gebrauchsmusik</span>
				<span class='text'>These works included piano pieces (''The Young Pioneers'') and an opera (''The Second Hurricane'')</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pollack|1999|p=303}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Carlos Chavez</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Carlos Chávez in 1937]]During the Depression years, Copland traveled extensively to Europe, Africa, and Mexico</span>
				<span class='text'>He formed an important friendship with Mexican composer [[Carlos Chávez]] and would return often to Mexico for working vacations conducting engagements</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pollack|1999|pp=178, 226}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his initial visit to Mexico, Copland began composing the first of his signature works, ''[[El Salón México]]'', which he completed four years later in 1936</span>
				<span class='text'>This and other incidental commissions fulfilled the second goal of American [[Gebrauchsmusik]], creating music of wide appeal</span>
				<span class='text'>uring this time, he composed (for radio broadcast) &quot;Prairie Journal,&quot; one of his first pieces to convey the landscape of the American West</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pollack|1999|p=310}}&lt;/ref&gt; Branching out into theater, Copland also played an important role providing musical advice and inspiration to [[Group Theatre (New York)|The Group Theater]]—[[Stella Adler]]'s and [[Lee Strasberg]]'s &quot;method&quot; acting school</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pollack|1999|p=258}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Group Theater followed Copland's musical agenda and focused on plays that illuminated the American experience</span>
				<span class='text'>After Hitler and Mussolini's attacks on Spain in 1936, leftist parties had united in a [[Popular Front]] against Fascism</span>
				<span class='text'>Many Group Theater members were influenced by [[Marxism]] and other progressive philosophies, and several had joined the Communist Party, including [[Elia Kazan]] and [[Clifford Odets]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pollack|1999|p=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copland also had contact later with other major American playwrights, including [[Thornton Wilder]], [[William Inge]], [[Arthur Miller]], and [[Edward Albee]], and considered projects with all of them</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pollack|1999|p=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1930s, Copland wrote incidental music for several plays, including [[Irwin Shaw]]'s &quot;Quiet City&quot; (1939), considered one of his most personal and poignant scores</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pollack|1999|p=331}}&lt;/ref&gt;In 1939, Copland completed his first two Hollywood film scores, for ''[[Of Mice and Men (1939 film)|Of Mice and Men]]'' and ''[[Our Town (1940 film)|Our Town]]'', and received sizable commissions</span>
				<span class='text'>In the same year, he composed the radio score &quot;John Henry&quot;, based on [[John Henry (folklore)|the folk ballad]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Smith, p</span>
				<span class='text'>169&quot;&gt;Smith, p</span>
				<span class='text'>169&lt;/ref&gt; But it wasn't until the worldwide market for classical recordings boomed after World War II that he achieved economic security</span>
				<span class='text'>Even after securing a comfortable income, he continued to write, teach, lecture, and, eventually, conduct</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pollack|1999|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;Demonstrating his broad range, Copland in the 1930s began composing music for ballet, including his highly successful ''[[Billy the Kid (ballet)|Billy the Kid]]'' (1939), the second of four ballets he scored (after ''Hear Ye! Hear Ye!'' (1934))</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Smith, p</span>
				<span class='text'>187&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[Vivian Perlis]], Eugene Loring said of the ballet, &quot;In our western states, there were still a few old-timers who remembered Billy</span>
				<span class='text'>One came backstage in San Francisco to tell us that it was all fine, except that Billy really shot left-handed!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Interview, Eugene Loring with Perlis, by telephone, 14 December 1981</span>
				<span class='text'>Loring died 30 August 1982</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Copland's ballet music established him as an authentic composer of American music much as Stravinsky's ballet scores connected the composer with Russian music</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Smith, p</span>
				<span class='text'>184&lt;/ref&gt; Copland's timing was excellent; he helped fill a vacuum for the American choreographers who needed suitable music to score their own nationalistic dance repertory</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Smith, p</span>
				<span class='text'>185&lt;/ref&gt;In keeping with the wartime period, Copland's &quot;Piano Sonata&quot; (1941) was a piece characterized as &quot;grim, nervous, elegiac, with pervasive bell-like tolling of alarm and mourning</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; It was later adapted to &quot;Day on Earth,&quot; a landmark American dance by Doris Humphrey</span>

				<span class='text'>182&lt;/ref&gt; Through royalties and with his great success from 1940 on, Copland amassed a multimillion-dollar fortune by the time of his death</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pollack|1999|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;The decade of the 1940s was arguably Copland's most productive, and it firmly established his worldwide fame</span>
				<span class='text'>His two ballet scores for ''[[Rodeo (Copland)|Rodeo]]'' (1942) and ''[[Appalachian Spring]]'' (1944) were huge successes</span>
				<span class='text'>His pieces ''[[Lincoln Portrait]]'' and ''[[Fanfare for the Common Man]]'' have become patriotic standards (See Popular works, below)</span>
				<span class='text'>Also important was the ''[[Symphony No</span>

				<span class='text'>Composed in a two-year period from 1944 to 1946, it became Copland's best-known symphony</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pollack|1999|pp=410, 418}}&lt;/ref&gt;In 1945, Copland contributed to ''Jubilee Variation'', a work commissioned by the Cincinnati Symphony in which ten American composers collaborated, but the piece is seldom heard in the concert hall</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Italy Fulbright Commission]] scholarship to study in Rome, which he did the following year</span>
				<span class='text'>Around this time, he also composed his ''Piano Quartet'', adopting Schoenberg's twelve-tone method of composition, and ''Old American Songs'' (1950), the first set of which was premiered by Peter Pears and Benjamin Britten, the second by [[William Warfield]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>467&lt;/ref&gt;Because of the political climate of that era, ''A Lincoln Portrait'' was withdrawn from the 1953 inaugural concert for President [[Dwight Eisenhower|Eisenhower]]</span>
				<span class='text'>That same year, Copland was called before [[Congress of the United States|Congress]], where he testified that he was never a communist</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>456&lt;/ref&gt;Despite the difficulties that his suspected Communist sympathies posed, Copland nonetheless traveled extensively during the 1950s and early 1960s, observing the [[avant-garde]] styles of Europe while experiencing the new school of Soviet music</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, he was rather taken with the work of [[Toru Takemitsu]] while in Japan and began a correspondence with him that would last over the next decade</span>
				<span class='text'>Copland wrote of the Japanese composer: &quot;He has the 'pure gold' touch, he chooses his notes carefully and meaningfully</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>464&lt;/ref&gt; Copland also gained exposure to the latest musical trends in Poland and Scandinavia</span>
				<span class='text'>In observing these new musical forms, Copland revised his text &quot;The New Music&quot; with comments on the styles that he encountered</span>
				<span class='text'>In particular, while Copland explained the importance of the work of [[John Cage]] and others (in his chapter titled &quot;The Music of Chance&quot;), he found that these radical trends in music which appealed to those &quot;who enjoy teetering on the edge of chaos&quot; were less likely to gain the appreciation of a wider audience &quot;who envisage art as a bulwark against the irrationality of man's nature</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; As he summarized: &quot;I've spent most of my life trying to get the right note in the right place</span>
				<span class='text'>Just throwing it open to chance seems to go against my natural instincts</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>465&lt;/ref&gt;In 1954, Copland received a commission from [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Oscar Hammerstein II|Oscar Hammerstein]] to create music for the opera ''[[The Tender Land]]'', based on [[James Agee]]'s ''[[Let Us Now Praise Famous Men]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Smith, p</span>
				<span class='text'>217&lt;/ref&gt; Copland had been wary of writing an opera, being especially aware of the pitfalls of that form, including weak libretti and demanding production values</span>

				<span class='text'>470&quot;&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>470&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Copland decided to try his hand at &quot;la forme fatale,&quot; especially as the 1950s were boom times for American playwrights, with [[Arthur Miller]], [[Clifford Odets]] and [[Thornton Wilder]] doing some of their best work</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>470&quot;/&gt; Originally two acts, ''The Tender Land'' was later expanded to three</span>
				<span class='text'>As Copland feared, critics found the libretto to be the opera's weakness, and he later stated: &quot;I admit that if I have one regret it is that I never did write a 'grand opera'</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>478&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of its flaws, the opera has established itself as one of the few American operas in the standard repertory</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1957, 1958, and 1976, Copland was the Music Director of the [[Ojai Music Festival]], a classical and contemporary music festival in [[Ojai, California]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Bernstein was considered the finest conductor of Copland's works and cites Copland's &quot;aesthetic, simplicity with originality&quot; as being his strongest and most influential traits</span>

				<span class='text'>289&lt;/ref&gt;For the occasion of the [[The Metropolitan Museum of Art Centennial|Metropolitan Museum of Art Centennial]], Copland composed ''Ceremonial Fanfare For Brass Ensemble'' to accompany the exhibition &quot;Masterpieces Of Fifty Centuries</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Later life===From the 1960s onward, Copland's activities turned more from composing to conducting</span>
				<span class='text'>Though not enamored with the prospect, he found himself without new ideas for composition, saying: &quot;It was exactly as if someone had simply turned off a faucet</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>516&lt;/ref&gt; Copland was a frequent guest conductor of orchestras in the U</span>

				<span class='text'>He made a series of recordings of his music, primarily for [[Columbia Records]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1960, [[RCA Victor]] released Copland's recordings with the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] of the orchestral suites from ''Appalachian Spring'' and ''The Tender Land''; these recordings were later reissued on CD, as were most of Copland's Columbia recordings (by Sony)</span>

				<span class='text'>Much of his large estate was bequeathed to the creation of the Aaron Copland Fund for Composers, which bestows over $600,000 per year to performing groups</span>

				<span class='text'>548&lt;/ref&gt;===Personal life===Deciding not to follow the example of his father, a solid Democrat, Copland never enrolled as a member of any political party, but he espoused a general progressive view and had strong ties with numerous colleagues and friends in the Popular Front, including Odets</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>presidential election, 1936|1936 presidential election]], at the height of his involvement with [[Group Theatre (New York)|The Group Theater]], and remained a committed opponent of militarism and the Cold War, which he regarded as having been instigated by the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>He condemned it as &quot;almost worse for art than the real thing&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>

				<span class='text'>Wallace]] on the Progressive Party ticket</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, he was later investigated by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] during the [[McCarthyism|Red scare]] of the 1950s and found himself [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]]</span>
				<span class='text'>opland was included on an FBI list of 151 artists thought to have Communist associations</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Joseph McCarthy]] and [[Roy Cohn]] questioned Copland about his lecturing abroad and his affiliations with various organizations and events, neglecting completely Copland's works which made a virtue of American values</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Senate Hearing 1267–1289&lt;/ref&gt;Given the nature of the hearings, Copland was asked to prepare explanations for his seemingly large involvement in explicitly communist and communist leaning organizations</span>

				<span class='text'>458&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, beginning in 1950, Copland, who had been appalled at Stalin's persecution of [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]] and other artists, began resigning from participation in leftist groups</span>
				<span class='text'>He decried the lack of artistic freedom in the Soviet Union, and in his 1954 Norton lecture he asserted that loss of freedom under Soviet Communism deprived artists of &quot;the immemorial right of the artist to be wrong</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollack 328&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to his compositions one of his earliest musical interests was with [[klezmer]] music</span>

				<span class='text'>Like many of his contemporaries he guarded his privacy, especially in regard to his homosexuality, providing very few written details about his private life</span>
				<span class='text'>However, he was one of the few composers of his stature to live openly and travel with his intimates, most of whom were talented, much younger men</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack&quot;/&gt; Kraft fathered a child to whom Copland later provided financial security, through a bequest from his estate</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack&quot;/&gt;==Composer=={{See also|List of compositions by Aaron Copland}}===Influences===Copland's earliest musical inclinations as a teenager ran toward [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]], [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]], [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] and the Russian composers</span>
				<span class='text'>Some of his preferences might also have been formed by the anti-German feelings during World War I, as later he studied German music</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>36&lt;/ref&gt; Copland's curiosity about the latest music from Debussy and [[Alexander Scriabin|Scriabin]] was frustrated by the fact that the scores of &quot;avant-garde&quot; works were expensive at that time and hard to come by</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Smith, p</span>
				<span class='text'>30&quot;/&gt; So he borrowed these works from a music library and studied them intensely</span>
				<span class='text'>Some of his earliest compositions were songs and piano pieces inspired by these European influences</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>41&quot;/&gt;Copland's teacher and mentor [[Nadia Boulanger]] became his most important influence</span>
				<span class='text'>In gratitude for the immense support and promotion on his behalf, he told her in 1950, &quot;I shall count our meeting the most important of my musical life&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Whatever I have accomplished is intimately associated in my mind with those early years, and with what you have since been as inspiration and example</span>

				<span class='text'>49&quot;&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>49&lt;/ref&gt; Of all her students, she listed Copland first</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>50&lt;/ref&gt; Copland especially admired Boulanger's total grasp of all classical music, and he was encouraged to experiment and develop a &quot;clarity of conception and elegance in proportion</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Following her model, he studied all periods of classical music and all forms—from madrigals to symphonies</span>
				<span class='text'>This breadth of vision led Copland to compose music for numerous settings—orchestra, opera, solo piano, small ensemble, art song, ballet, theater and film</span>
				<span class='text'>Boulanger particularly emphasized &quot;la grande ligne&quot; (the long line), &quot;a sense of forward motion&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>the feeling for inevitability, for the creating of an entire piece that could be thought of as a functioning entity</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>49&quot;/&gt;In discovering [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], Copland pointed out: &quot;[Bach has an] inexhaustible wealth of musical riches, which no music lover can afford to ignore&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>What strikes me most markedly about Bach's work is the marvelous rightness of it</span>
				<span class='text'>It is the rightness not merely of a single individual, but a whole musical epoch</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>59&lt;/ref&gt; Copland stated that an ideal music might combine [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s &quot;spontaneity and refinement&quot; with [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]]'s &quot;purity&quot; and Bach's &quot;profundity&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>60&lt;/ref&gt;Copland was excited to be so close to the new post-Impressionistic French music of [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]], [[Albert Roussel|Roussel]], and [[Erik Satie|Satie]], as well as [[Les six]], a group that included [[Darius Milhaud|Milhaud]], [[Francis Poulenc|Poulenc]], and [[Arthur Honegger|Honegger]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Anton Webern|Webern]], [[Alban Berg|Berg]], and [[Béla Bartók|Bartók]] also impressed him</span>
				<span class='text'>Copland was &quot;insatiable&quot; in seeking out the newest European music, whether in concerts, score reading or heated debate</span>
				<span class='text'>These &quot;moderns&quot; were discarding the old laws of composition and experimenting with new forms, harmonies and rhythms, and including the use of jazz and quarter-tone music</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Smith, p</span>
				<span class='text'>39&lt;/ref&gt; [[Serge Koussevitzky]] had just arrived in Paris and was adding to the ferment by conducting and promoting the new music of Russia and France</span>
				<span class='text'>Later he would conduct many Copland premieres in New York</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Smith, p</span>
				<span class='text'>63&lt;/ref&gt; Among the first performances that Copland attended was Milhaud's ''[[La création du monde]]'', which caused riots in Paris</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Smith, p</span>
				<span class='text'>50&lt;/ref&gt; Milhaud was Copland's inspiration for some of his earlier &quot;jazzy&quot; works</span>
				<span class='text'>He was also exposed to Schoenberg and admired his earlier atonal pieces, thinking Schoenberg's ''[[Pierrot Lunaire]]'' a landmark work comparable to Stravinsky's &quot;[[The Rite of Spring]]</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Copland even tried out Schoenberg's innovative twelve-tone system and adapted it to his style</span>

				<span class='text'>65&quot;&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>65&lt;/ref&gt;Above all others, Copland named Igor Stravinsky as his &quot;hero&quot; and his favorite 20th-century composer</span>

				<span class='text'>rg/story/217199-what-american-music/&lt;/ref&gt; As a publicly identified composer of iconic American music, Copland's claim that American composers are still in search for a certain freshness to composition—found in Stravinsky—show they continuing uncertainty of the American art music scene in the 1950s</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite using folk themes as a tool for signifying Americanness, Copland continued to find &quot;freshness&quot; in Stravinsky's work—especially in his usage of rhythm</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;wnyc</span>
				<span class='text'>rg&quot;/&gt; Copland was similarly but not quite as strongly impressed by [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s &quot;fresh, clean-cut, articulate style</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>71&lt;/ref&gt;Another inspiration for much of Copland's music was [[jazz]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Although familiar with jazz back in America—having listened to it and also played it in bands—he fully realized its potential while traveling in Austria: &quot;The impression of jazz one receives in a foreign country is totally unlike the impression of such music heard in one's own country&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>when I heard jazz played in Vienna, it was like hearing it for the first time</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith, p</span>
				<span class='text'>60&quot;/&gt; He also found that the distance from his native country helped him see the United States more clearly</span>
				<span class='text'>Beginning in 1923, he employed &quot;jazzy elements&quot; in his classical music, but by the late 1930s, he moved on to Latin and American folk tunes in his more successful pieces</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>120&quot;&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>120&lt;/ref&gt; His earlier works especially demonstrate the influence of jazz rhythmic, timbral and harmonic practices</span>
				<span class='text'>That influence is apparent in a few later works, such as the Clarinet Concerto commissioned by [[Benny Goodman]]</span>
				<span class='text'>During the late 1920s and 1930s, Copland sought out jazz at the Cotton Club and heard [[Duke Ellington]], [[Benny Carter]] and [[Bix Beiderbecke]], among others</span>
				<span class='text'>Of Duke Ellington among other jazz composers, Copland said he was &quot;the master of them all</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>116&lt;/ref&gt;Although Copland was intrigued by the idea of a &quot;jazz concerto&quot; and &quot;symphonic jazz,&quot; his Concerto for Piano and Orchestra did not succeed in that form as had those of Maurice Ravel and George Gershwin, who was praised by such eminent musical exiles as Schoenberg, Bartók, and Stravinsky (Gershwin had recently died at 38 and so was no longer a potential rival)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>120&quot;/&gt; Copland would go on to write extensively and deliver the Norton lectures about jazz in America, especially the [[big band]] sound (1930s) and cool [[West Coast jazz]] (1950s)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollack, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>116–117&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, enthusiastic as he was about jazz throughout his life, Copland also recognized its limitations: &lt;blockquote&gt;With the [Piano] Concerto I felt I had done all I could with the idiom, considering its limited emotional scope</span>
				<span class='text'>True, it was an easy way to be American in musical terms, but all American music could not possibly be confined to two dominant jazz moods – the blues and the snappy number</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Jazz played an important role for some of Copland's compositions</span>
				<span class='text'>What constituted as Jazz was contested by many musicians and scholars</span>
				<span class='text'>Copland believed that the essence of Jazz was rooted in rhythm</span>
				<span class='text'>Copland identified any sort of syncopation as metrical phenomenon</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kleppinger: On the Influence of Jazz Rhythm in the Music of Aaron Copland http://www</span>
				<span class='text'>stor</span>
				<span class='text'>rg/stable/3250557&lt;/ref&gt; He called ragtime Jazz' closest ancestor, while also citing the foxtrot rhythm—and later the usage of poly-rhythms as the basis for modern jazz</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kleppinger 76&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1950s,Copland had come to see the possibilities of Jazz less and less in his compositions, though the idea of syncopated rhythm would continue to feature prominently in many of his works</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough his early focus of jazz gave way to other influences, Copland continued to make use of jazz in more subtle ways in later works</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>120&quot;/&gt; But it was the synthesizing of all his influences and inclinations which create the &quot;Americanism&quot; of his music</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Smith, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>292–4&lt;/ref&gt; Copland pointed out in summarizing the American character of his music, &quot;the optimistic tone&quot;, &quot;his love of rather large canvases&quot;, &quot;a certain directness in expression of sentiment&quot;, and &quot;a certain songfulness&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>530&lt;/ref&gt; As he advanced in his career (by 1941), he said of himself and advised other composers: &lt;blockquote&gt;I no longer feel the need of seeking out conscious Americanisms [folksongs and folk rhythms]</span>
				<span class='text'>Because we live here and work here, we can be certain that when our music is mature it will also be American in quality</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/blockquote&gt; In contradiction to this statement, however, he continued to look for and employ folk material for several more years</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Smith, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>223–5&lt;/ref&gt;Copland's work from the late 1940s onward included experimentation with [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schönberg]]'s [[twelve-tone]] system, resulting in two major works, the ''Piano Quartet'' (1950) and the ''Piano Fantasy'' (1957)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>481&quot;&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>481&lt;/ref&gt;===Early work===Copland's earliest compositions before leaving for Paris were short works for piano and some [[art song]]s, inspired mostly by Liszt and Debussy</span>
				<span class='text'>He experimented with ambiguous beginnings and endings, rapid key changes, and the frequent use of tritones</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>41&quot;/&gt; His first published work was ''[[The Old Cat and the Young Mouse|The Cat and the Mouse]]''&amp;nbsp;(1920), a piano solo piece based on a fable by [[Jean de la Fontaine]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Smith, p</span>
				<span class='text'>51&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Three Moods'' (1921), Copland's final movement is entitled &quot;Jazzy&quot;, which he noted &quot;is based on two jazz melodies and ought to make the old professors sit up and take notice&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>44&lt;/ref&gt;One of Copland's first significant works upon returning from his studies in Paris was the [[necromancy|necromantic]] ballet ''Grohg''</span>
				<span class='text'>This ballet, suggested to Copland by the film ''[[Nosferatu]]'', a free adaptation of the [[Dracula]] tale, provided the source material for his later ''Dance Symphony''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>86&lt;/ref&gt; Originally intended as an orchestral exercise while he was studying in Paris, Copland completed it as a full orchestral score after returning to New York in 1925</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollack, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>81–82&lt;/ref&gt; It too had &quot;jazz elements&quot; as did many of Copland's works in the 1920s</span>
				<span class='text'>opland's ''[[Symphony for Organ and Orchestra (Copland)|Symphony for Organ and Orchestra]]'' (1924) brought him into contact with [[Serge Koussevitzky]], a conductor known as a champion of &quot;new music&quot;, and another figure who would prove to be influential in Copland's life, perhaps the second most important after Boulanger</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollack, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>121–122&lt;/ref&gt; Koussevitzky performed twelve Copland works during his tenure as conductor of the Boston Symphony</span>
				<span class='text'>Copland's relationship with Koussevitzky was apparently unique, as his interpretations of Copland's works reflected the particular admiration that the latter had for the young composer</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>123&lt;/ref&gt;  Copland's ''Music for the Theatre'' (1925) and the ''Piano Concerto'' (1926) were both composed for Koussevitzky</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>114&lt;/ref&gt;Visits to Europe in 1926 and 1927 brought him into contact with the most recent developments there, including Webern's ''Five Pieces for Orchestra'', which greatly impressed him</span>
				<span class='text'>In August 1927, while staying in Königstein, Copland wrote ''Poet's Song'', a setting of a text by [[E</span>
				<span class='text'>E</span>
				<span class='text'>Cummings]] and his first composition using Schoenberg's twelve-tone technique</span>
				<span class='text'>This was followed by the ''Symphonic Ode'' (1929) and the ''Piano Variations'' (1930), both of which rely on the exhaustive development of a single short motive</span>
				<span class='text'>This procedure, which provided Copland with more formal flexibility and a greater emotional range than in his earlier music, is similar to Schoenberg's idea of &quot;continuous variation&quot; and, according to Copland's own admission, was influenced by the twelve-tone method, though neither work actually uses a twelve-tone row</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollack, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;68, 138, 147</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Other major works of his first period include the ''[[Piano Variations (Copland)|Piano Variations]]'' (1930), and the ''Short Symphony'' (1933)</span>
				<span class='text'>However, this jazz-inspired period was relatively brief, as his style evolved toward the goal of writing more accessible works using folk sources</span>
				<span class='text'>==Popular works===Impressed with the success of Virgil Thomson's ''[[Four Saints in Three Acts]]'', Copland wrote ''[[El Salón México]]'' between 1932 and 1936, which met with a popular acclaim that contrasted the relative obscurity of most of his previous works</span>
				<span class='text'>It appears he intended it to be a popular favorite, as he wrote in 1955: &quot;It seems a long long time since anyone has written an ''[[España (Chabrier)|España]]'' or ''[[Boléro|Bolero]]''—the kind of brilliant orchestral piece that everyone loves</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Copland, p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;133</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Inspiration for this work came from Copland's vivid recollection of visiting the &quot;Salon Mexico&quot; dancehall where he witnessed a more intimate view of Mexico's nightlife</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;The Story Behind my El Salon Mexico http://www</span>
				<span class='text'>stor</span>
				<span class='text'>rg/stable/943608&lt;/ref&gt; For Copland, the biggest impact came, not from the music of the people dancing, but from the spirit of the environment</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;The Story Behind my El Salon Mexico&lt;/ref&gt; Copland said that he could literally feel the essence of the Mexican people in the dance hall</span>
				<span class='text'>This prompted him to write a piece celebrating the spirit of Mexico using Mexican Themes</span>
				<span class='text'>Copland derived freely from two collections of Mexican folk tunes, changing pitches and varying rhythms</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>299&lt;/ref&gt; The use of a folk tune with variations set in a symphonic context started a pattern he repeated in many of his most successful works right on through the 1940s</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>300&lt;/ref&gt;  This work also marked the return of jazz patterns to Copland's compositional style, though they appeared in a more subdued form than before and were no longer the centerpiece</span>
				<span class='text'>Chávez conducted the premiere, and ''[[El Salón México]]'' became an international hit, gaining Copland wide recognition</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>302&lt;/ref&gt;Copland achieved his first major success in ballet music with his groundbreaking score ''[[Billy the Kid (ballet)|Billy the Kid]]'' , based on a Walter Noble Burns novel, with choreography by Eugene Loring</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>317&lt;/ref&gt; The ballet was among the first to display an American music and dance vocabulary, adapting the &quot;strong technique and intense charm of Astaire&quot; and other American dancers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>315&lt;/ref&gt; It was distinctive in its use of [[polyrhythm]] and [[polyharmony]], particularly in the cowboy songs</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Smith, p</span>
				<span class='text'>189&lt;/ref&gt; The ballet premiered in New York in 1939, with Copland recalling &quot;I cannot remember another work of mine that was so unanimously received</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>323&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Martin (dance critic)|John Martin]] wrote, &quot;Aaron Copland has furnished an admirable score, warm and human, and with not a wasted note about it anywhere</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p</span>
				<span class='text'>188&lt;/ref&gt; It became a staple work of the [[American Ballet Theatre]], and Copland's twenty-minute suite from the ballet became part of the standard orchestral repertoire</span>
				<span class='text'>When asked how a Jewish New Yorker managed so well to capture the Old West, Copland answered &quot;It was just a feat of imagination</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>325&lt;/ref&gt;In the early 1940s, Copland produced two important works intended as national morale boosters</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[Fanfare for the Common Man]]'', scored for [[brass instrument|brass]] and percussion, was written in 1942 at the request of the conductor [[Eugene Aynsley Goossens|Eugene Goossens]], conductor of the [[Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It would later be used to open many Democratic National Conventions, and to add dignity to a wide range of other events</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>361&quot;&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>361&lt;/ref&gt; Even musical groups from [[Woody Herman]]'s jazz band to the [[Rolling Stones]] adapted the opening theme</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer]] recorded a &quot;[[progressive rock]]&quot; version of the composition in 1977</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>362&lt;/ref&gt; The [[fanfare]] was also used as the main theme of the fourth movement of Copland's ''[[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>3 (Copland)|Third Symphony]],'' where it first appears in a quiet, pastoral manner, then in the brassier form of the original</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>412&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Copland wrote ''[[A Lincoln Portrait]]'', a commission from conductor [[André Kostelanetz]], leading to a further strengthening of his association with American patriotic music</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>357&lt;/ref&gt; The work is famous for the spoken recitation of Lincoln's words, though the idea had been previously employed by [[John Alden Carpenter]]'s &quot;Song of Faith&quot; based on [[George Washington]]'s quotations</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>358&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Lincoln Portrait&quot; is often performed at national holiday celebrations</span>
				<span class='text'>Many Americans have performed the recitation, including politicians, actors, and musicians and Copland himself, with [[Henry Fonda]] doing the most notable recording</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>361&quot;/&gt;Continuing his string of successes, in 1942 Copland composed the ballet ''[[Rodeo (ballet)|Rodeo]],'' a tale of a ranch wedding, written around the same time as ''[[Lincoln Portrait]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>''Rodeo'' is another enduring composition for Copland and contains many recognizable folk tunes, well-blended with Copland's original music</span>
				<span class='text'>Notable in the final movement, is the striking &quot;Hoedown&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>This was a recreation of Appalachian fiddler W</span>
				<span class='text'>H</span>
				<span class='text'>Stepp's version of the square-dance tune &quot;Bonypart&quot; (&quot;Bonaparte's Retreat&quot;), which had been transcribed for piano by [[Ruth Crawford Seeger]] and published in Alan Lomax and Seeger's book, ''Our Singing Country'' (1941)</span>
				<span class='text'>For the &quot;Hoedown&quot; in ''Rodeo'' Copland borrowed note for note from Seeger's piano transcription of Stepp's tune</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Stepp's fiddle tune had been collected in 1937 by Alan and Elizabeth Lomax and published in ''Our Singing Country'' (1941)</span>
				<span class='text'>See Judith Tick's preface to John A</span>
				<span class='text'>and Alan Lomax and Ruth Crawford Seeger's, ''Our Singing Country Folk Songs and Ballads'' (Dover, 2000), p</span>
				<span class='text'>xvii</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This fragment (lifted from Ruth Crawford Seeger) is now one of the best-known compositions by any American composer, having been used numerous times in movies and on television, including commercials for the American beef industry</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Smith, p</span>
				<span class='text'>193&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Hoedown&quot; was given a rock arrangement by [[Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer]] in 1972</span>
				<span class='text'>The ballet, originally titled &quot;The Courting at Burnt Ranch&quot;, was choreographed by [[Agnes de Mille]], niece of film giant [[Cecil B</span>
				<span class='text'>DeMille]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>367&lt;/ref&gt;  It premiered at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] on October 16, 1942, with de Mille dancing the principal &quot;cowgirl&quot; role and the performance received a standing ovation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>372&lt;/ref&gt; A reduced score is still popular as an orchestral piece, especially at &quot;Pops&quot; concerts</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Martha Graham 1948</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|Martha Graham in 1948]]Copland was commissioned to write another ballet, ''[[Appalachian Spring]]'', originally written using thirteen instruments, which he ultimately arranged as a popular [[orchestral suite]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Grout and Palisca, p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;{{Page needed|date=September 2013}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  The commission for ''Appalachian Spring'' came from [[Martha Graham]], who had requested of Copland merely &quot;music for an American ballet&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Copland titled the piece &quot;Ballet for Martha&quot;, having no idea of how she would use it on stage but he had her in mind</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;When I wrote 'Appalachian Spring' I was thinking primarily about Martha and her unique choreographic style, which I knew well&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>And she's unquestionably very American: there's something prim and restrained, simple yet strong, about her which one tends to think of as American</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>388&lt;/ref&gt; Copland borrowed the flavor of [[Shaker]] songs and dances, and directly used the dance song [[Simple Gifts]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hall, p</span>
				<span class='text'>51&lt;/ref&gt; Graham took the score and created a ballet she called ''Appalachian Spring'' (from a poem by [[Hart Crane]] which had no connection with Shakers)</span>
				<span class='text'>It was an instant success, and the music later acquired the same name</span>
				<span class='text'>Copland was amused and delighted later in life when people would come up to him and say: &quot;Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Copland, when I see that ballet and when I hear your music I can see the Appalachians and just feel spring</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Copland had no particular setting in mind while writing the music, he just tried to give it an American flavor, and had no knowledge of the borrowed title, in which &quot;spring&quot; refers to a spring of water, not the season Spring</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>402&lt;/ref&gt;===Symphonic works===Copland composed three numbered symphonies, but applied the word &quot;symphony&quot; to more than just symphonies of typical structure</span>
				<span class='text'>He re-orchestrated his early three-movement Organ Symphony omitting the organ, calling the result his [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>1 (Copland)|First Symphony]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His fifteen-minute ''Short Symphony'' was the Second Symphony, though it also exists as the Sextet</span>
				<span class='text'>His ''Dance Symphony'' was hurriedly extracted from the earlier unproduced ballet ''Grohg'' to meet an [[RCA Records]] commission deadline</span>
				<span class='text'>he [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>3 (Copland)|Third Symphony]] is in the more traditional format (four movements; second movement, scherzo; third movement, adagio) and is his most famous symphony</span>
				<span class='text'>At forty minutes, it is his longest orchestral composition</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>410&quot;&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>410&lt;/ref&gt; He composed it with Koussevitzky's unique character in mind, &quot;I knew exactly the kind of music he enjoyed conducting and the sentiments he brought with it, and I knew the sound of his orchestra, so I had every reason to do my darnedest to write a symphony in the grand manner</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>410&quot;/&gt; Among the details of interest in the work is Copland's use of palindromic structure—whole movements as well as melodies end as they began</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>416&lt;/ref&gt; Completing the work after World War II was won by the Allies, he stated that the symphony was &quot;intended to reflect the euphoric spirit of the country at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>410&quot;/&gt; The work received generally strong acclaim</span>
				<span class='text'>Koussevitzky &quot;declared it simply the greatest American symphony ever written</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Arthur Berger stated that it achieved &quot;a kind of panorama of all the musical resources that have through the years formed his musical language</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; While [[Leonard Bernstein]] &quot;deemed it the epitome of a decades-long search by many composers for a distinctly American music</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>417&lt;/ref&gt; It is the best known, most performed, and most recorded American symphony of the 20th Century</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>418&lt;/ref&gt;===Later work===Copland's work in the late 1940s and 1950s included use of [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schönberg]]'s [[twelve-tone]] system, a development that he recognized as important, but which he did not fully embrace</span>
				<span class='text'>His first result was his &quot;Piano Quartet&quot; (1950)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>445&lt;/ref&gt; However, he found the atonality of serialized music to run counter to his desire to reach a wide audience</span>
				<span class='text'>So, in contrast to the Second Viennese School, Copland's use of the system emphasized the importance of the &quot;classicalizing principles&quot;, in order to prevent the material from falling into &quot;near-chaos&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>462&lt;/ref&gt; He began his first serial work, the &quot;Piano Fantasy,&quot; in 1951 to fulfill a commission from the young virtuoso pianist [[William Kapell]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The piece became one of his most challenging works, over which he labored until 1957</span>
				<span class='text'>During the work's development, in 1953, Kapell died in an aircraft crash</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>481&quot;/&gt; Critics lauded the &quot;Fantasy&quot; when it was finally premiered, calling the piece &quot;an outstanding addition to his own oeuvre and to contemporary piano literature&quot; and &quot;a tremendous achievement&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Jay Rosenfield stated, &quot;This is a new Copland to us, an artist advancing with strength and not building on the past alone</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pollack, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>484–5&lt;/ref&gt;Copland had approached dodecaphony with some initial skepticism</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he had been &quot;well aware that serial composition was the dominant method of composition&quot; after [[World War II]], he expressed doubts about it to Panamanian composer [[Roque Cordero]] at Tanglewood in 1946 and added in 1948, &quot;Now they have come up with the Schoenberg twelve-tone system, 'discovering' it as if it were something quite new</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Copland and Perlis|p=151}}{{sfn|Pollack|p=445}} While in Europe in 1949, he heard a number of serial works but did not admire much of it because &quot;so often it seemed that individuality was sacrificed to the method</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Copland and Perlis|p=151}} However, the music of French composer [[Pierre Boulez]] showed him that the technique could be separated from the &quot;old Wagnerian&quot; aesthetic with which he had associated it previously</span>
				<span class='text'>The late music of Austrian composer [[Anton Webern]] and twelve-tone pieces by Swiss composer [[Frank Martin (composer)|Frank Martin]] and Italian composer [[Luigi Dallapiccola]] only strengthened this opinion</span>
				<span class='text'>ventually, Copland came to the conclusion that composing along serial lines was &quot;like looking at a picture from a different point of view</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Copland and Perlis|p=151}} He explained in 1957, &quot;As I see it, twelve-tonism is nothing more than an angle of vision</span>
				<span class='text'>Like fugal treatment, it is a stimulus that enlivens musical thinking, especially when applied to a series of tones that lend themselves to that treatment</span>
				<span class='text'>It is a method, not a style; and therefore it solves no problems of musical expressivity</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Pollack|pp=445–6}} He began using dodecaphonism &quot;with the hope that it would freshen and enrich my [compositional] technique</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Copland and Perlis|p=151}}One attraction of serial composition, Copland said, &quot;was that I began to hear chords that I wouldn't have heard otherwise</span>
				<span class='text'>Heretofore, I had been thinking tonally, but this was a new way of moving tones about</span>
				<span class='text'>It freshened up one's technique and one's approach</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Copland|p=555}} He liked the fact that the practice forced him to &quot;unconventionalize his thinking with respect to chordal structure&quot; and freshened &quot;his melodic and figurational imagination</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Copland|p=xxxii}} It fulfilled Copland's need for &quot;more chords,&quot; as he phrased it to Bernstein and what Taruskin calls a renewal of his &quot;technical or stylistic resources</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Taruskin|p=116}} As he later maintained in an interview, Copland attempted &quot;to do my own thing using an extended language</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Copland|p=356}} Throughout his career, he had been open to incorporating different musical styles into his music, such as [[jazz]] and folk music</span>
				<span class='text'>Serialism was one more style to adapt and use in his own way</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Straus|p=58}}Serialism also allowed Copland a synthesis of serial and non-serial practices, a dichotomy that according to musicologist Joseph Straus had long concerned Copland and had been considered irreconcilable</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Straus|p=61}} Copland wrote that, to him, serialism pointed in two opposite directions, one &quot;toward the extreme of total organization with electronic applications&quot; and the other &quot;a gradual absorption into what had become a very ''freely interpreted tonalism'' [italics Copland]</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Straus|pp=61-2}} The path he said he chose was the latter one, which he said, when he described his ''Piano Fantasy'', allowed him to incorporate &quot;elements able to be associated with the twelve-tone method and also with music tonally conceived</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Straus|pp=61–2}}Copland maintained that he used the technique in much the same manner as Schoenberg, in that he thought first of a musical theme rather than picking the theme from a series of notes</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Copland|p=356}} Nevertheless, his actual use of the tone row did not follow standard practice</span>
				<span class='text'>Schoenberg generally structured his twelve-tone music around complete statements of the row in one of its four shapes—prime or original (forward), retrograde (reversed), inverted or retrograde and inverted</span>
				<span class='text'>Copland rarely states a complete row</span>
				<span class='text'>He includes the prime and reversed forms of the row at moments of structural importance comparable to the exposition of the two themes in [[sonata form]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Otherwise, he used parts of the row of between two and six notes to form melodies and harmonies, a practice not far removed from how he composed his tonal works</span>
				<span class='text'>By doing so, Copland took advantage of the potential for richly-dense harmonies, built on seconds and their inversions, that dodecaphony made available</span>
				<span class='text'>In the Piano Quartet, this allowed him, according to Pollack, to combine &quot;familiarly Coplandesque gestures and moods&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>with fresh ideas and feelings</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Pollack|pp=447–8}}Even after Copland started using 12-tone techniques, he did not stick to them exclusively but went back and forth between tonal and non-tonal compositions</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Straus|p=60}} Other late works include: &quot;Dance Panels&quot; (1959, ballet music), &quot;Something Wild&quot; (1961, his last film score, much of which would be later incorporated into his &quot;Music for a Great City&quot;), &quot;[[Connotations (Copland)|Connotations]]&quot; (1962, for the new Lincoln Center Philharmonic hall), &quot;Emblems&quot; (1964, for wind band), &quot;Night Thoughts&quot; (1972, for the [[Van Cliburn International Piano Competition]]), and &quot;Proclamation'&quot; (1982, his last work, started in 1973)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollack, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>487–515&lt;/ref&gt;==Film composer==By the 1930s, Hollywood began to beckon &quot;serious&quot; composers with promises of better films and higher pay</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>336&lt;/ref&gt; The reality, however, was that few found good projects</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Smith, p</span>
				<span class='text'>179&lt;/ref&gt; Copland sought to enter that arena, as both a challenge for his abilities as a composer and an opportunity to expand his reputation and audience for his more serious works</span>
				<span class='text'>Unlike the total attention he would hope to get from a concert-goer, Copland wrote that film music had to achieve a balance</span>
				<span class='text'>It should be &quot;secondary in importance to the story being told on the screen&quot; while notably adding to the dramatic and emotional content of the film—but without diverting the viewer's attention from the action</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>348&lt;/ref&gt;Upon arriving in Hollywood in 1937, he had high hopes: &quot;It is just a matter of finding a feature film that needs my kind of music</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>337&lt;/ref&gt; What he found, however, was the ongoing tendency of studios to edit and cut movie scores, which often subverted a composer's intentions</span>
				<span class='text'>No projects seemed suitable at first</span>
				<span class='text'>But his patience paid off two years later when Copland found a kindred spirit in director Lewis Milestone, who allowed Copland to supervise his own orchestration and who refrained from interfering with his work</span>
				<span class='text'>Copland composed three of his five film scores for Milestone</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>340&quot;&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>340&lt;/ref&gt;This collaboration resulted in the notable film ''[[Of Mice and Men (1939 film)|Of Mice and Men]]'' (1939), from the novel by [[John Steinbeck]], that earned Copland his first nomination for an Academy Award ( he actually received two nominations, one for &quot;best score&quot; and another for &quot;original score&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>343&quot;&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>343&lt;/ref&gt; He considered himself lucky with his first film score: &quot;Here was an American theme, by a great American writer, demanding appropriate music</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>340&quot;/&gt; Having accepted small sums for other projects in the past, especially to help out cash-strapped productions involving friends, this time Copland would capitalize on his efforts: &quot;I thought if I was to sell myself to the movies, I ought to sell myself good</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; From then on, he became one of Hollywood's highest paid film composers, earning as much as $15,000 per film</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>90&quot;/&gt;In a departure from other film scores of the time, Copland's work largely reflected his own style, instead of the usual borrowing from the late-Romantic period</span>
				<span class='text'>Many silent and early talking films used classical music themes directly, both in the credit sequences and during the action</span>
				<span class='text'>But with Copland, the film score's purpose was more comprehensive and subtle, setting the atmosphere of time and place, illustrating the thoughts of the actors, providing continuity and filler, and shaping the emotion and drama</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>349&quot;&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>349&lt;/ref&gt; He often avoided the full orchestra, and he rejected the common practice of using a [[leitmotiv]] to identify characters with their own personal themes</span>
				<span class='text'>He instead matched a theme to the action, while avoiding the underlining of every action with exaggerated emphasis</span>
				<span class='text'>nother technique Copland employed was to keep silent during intimate screen moments and only begin the music as a confirming motive toward the end of a scene</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>342&lt;/ref&gt; [[Virgil Thompson]] wrote that the score for ''Of Mice and Men'' established &quot;the most distinguished populist musical style yet created in America</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>343&quot;/&gt; Many composers who scored for western movies, particularly between 1940 and 1960, were influenced by Copland's style, though some also followed the &quot;Max Steiner&quot; approach, which was more bombastic and obvious</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>349&quot;/&gt; As a commentator on film scores, Copland singled out [[Bernard Herrmann]], [[Miklós Rózsa]], [[Alex North]] and [[Erich Wolfgang Korngold]] as innovative leaders in the field</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>350&lt;/ref&gt;Copland's score for ''[[The North Star (1943 film)|The North Star]]'' (1943) was nominated for an [[Academy Award]], and his score for William Wyler's [[1949 film]], ''[[The Heiress]]'' won the award</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Smith, p</span>
				<span class='text'>215&lt;/ref&gt; Several themes from his scores are incorporated in the suite ''Music for Movies</span>
				<span class='text'>'&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith, p</span>
				<span class='text'>202&quot;/&gt; His score for the film adaptation of [[John Steinbeck]]'s novel ''[[The Red Pony (Copland)|The Red Pony]]'' was arranged by commission of the [[Houston Symphony Orchestra]] as a suite for their performance in October 1948 and became widely popular</span>
				<span class='text'>His score for the 1961 [[independent film]] ''[[Something Wild (1961 film)|Something Wild]]'' was released in 1964 as ''Music For a Great City''</span>
				<span class='text'>Copland also composed scores for two documentary films, ''[[The City (1939 film)|The City]]'' (1939) and ''The Cummington Story'' (1945)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Smith, p</span>
				<span class='text'>201&quot;&gt;Smith, p</span>
				<span class='text'>201&lt;/ref&gt;When commenting on the effectiveness of film scores, Copland said: &quot;I'd love to be able to have audiences see a film with the music, then see it a second time with the music turned off, and then see it a third time with the music turned on</span>
				<span class='text'>Then, I think they'd get a much more specific idea of what the music does for a film</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hall, p</span>
				<span class='text'>41&lt;/ref&gt;==Critic, writer, and teacher==Copland had a large following of pupils—often mixing his personal life with them</span>
				<span class='text'>Of notable students, Leonard Bernstein and Victor Kraft were two with whom he continued having intimately personal relationships</span>
				<span class='text'>Bernstein would go on to champion Copland as one of the greatest American composers of all time while being one of the few people Copland opened up to</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack&quot;/&gt;Copland also wrote prolifically on the subject of music</span>
				<span class='text'>Across decades, Copland has published pieces on music criticism analysis on musical trends, and on his own compositions</span>
				<span class='text'>Starting with his first critiques in 1924, Copland began a long career as music critic, teacher, and observer, mostly of contemporary classical music</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Smith, p</span>
				<span class='text'>265&lt;/ref&gt; He was an avid lecturer and lecturer-performer</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote reviews of specific works, trends, composers, festivals, books about music, and recordings</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Smith, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>264–5&lt;/ref&gt; He took on a wide range of issues from the most general (&quot;Creativity&quot;) to the most practical (&quot;Composer Economics&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>Copland also wrote three books, &quot;What to Listen for in Music (1939)&quot;, &quot;Our New Music (1941)&quot;, and &quot;Music and Imagination&quot; (1952)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Smith, p</span>
				<span class='text'>264&lt;/ref&gt; He had a long list of notable students (see below)</span>
				<span class='text'>Copland put a good deal of time and energy into supporting young musicians, especially through his association with the [[Berkshire Music Center]] at Tanglewood, both as a guest conductor and teacher</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Smith, p</span>
				<span class='text'>285&lt;/ref&gt; In working with young composers, Copland thought it more important to focus on expressive content than on technical points</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Smith, p</span>
				<span class='text'>290&lt;/ref&gt;==Conductor==Copland studied conducting in Paris in 1921, but not until his involvement conducting his own Hollywood scores, did he undertake it except out of necessity</span>
				<span class='text'>On his international travels in the 1940s, however, he began to make appearances as a guest conductor, performing his own works</span>
				<span class='text'>By the 1950s, he was conducting the works of other composers as well</span>
				<span class='text'>From the 1960s on, he conducted far more than he composed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollack, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>534–5&lt;/ref&gt;A self-taught conductor, Copland developed a very personal style</span>
				<span class='text'>He occasionally asked friend [[Leonard Bernstein]] for advice</span>
				<span class='text'>Copland took an understated and unpretentious approach to conducting and modeled his style after other composer/conductors such as Stravinsky and Hindemith</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>536&quot;&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>536&lt;/ref&gt; Observers of Copland noted that he had &quot;none of the typical conductorial vanities&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>537&lt;/ref&gt; Though his friendly and modest persona, and his great enthusiasm, were appreciated by professional orchestra musicians, some criticized his beat as &quot;unsteady&quot; and his interpretations as &quot;unexciting&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>538&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his peers, like Koussevitzky, went even further, advising him to &quot;stay home and compose&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>533&lt;/ref&gt; Copland thoroughly enjoyed conducting but admitted that he did it in part because in the last seventeen years of his life he felt little inspiration to compose</span>
				<span class='text'>He was offered &quot;permanent&quot; conducting posts but preferred to operate as a guest conductor</span>
				<span class='text'>Nearly all of Copland's conducting appearances included his own works, which added to the intoxication of conducting</span>
				<span class='text'>As he stated, &quot;Conducting puts one in a very powerful position&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Best of all, it is a use of power for a good purpose</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; It also allowed him the freedom to travel which he always enjoyed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>535&quot;&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>535&lt;/ref&gt;Copland was a strong advocate for newer music and composers, and his programs always included heavy representation of [[20th-century music]] and lesser-known composers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>536&quot;/&gt; Performers and audiences generally greeted his conducting appearances as positive opportunities to hear his music as the composer intended, but sometimes found his efforts with other composers to be lacking</span>
				<span class='text'>From Copland's point of view, he found both the New York Philharmonic and the Boston Symphony Orchestra to be &quot;tough&quot; groups, resistant to newer music</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>539&quot;&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>539&lt;/ref&gt; Newton Mansfield, violinist with the New York Philharmonic, stated, &quot;The orchestra didn't take him too seriously</span>
				<span class='text'>It was like going out to a nice lunch</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>539&quot;/&gt; Copland also found resistance from European orchestras; however, he was warmly received and respected in England</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p</span>
				<span class='text'>540&lt;/ref&gt; Copland recorded nearly all his orchestral works with himself conducting</span>
