				<span class='text'>''Philosophical Forum''</span>
				<span class='text'>30 (4): 329-46&lt;/ref&gt; In the first division of the work, Heidegger attempted to turn away from &quot;[[ontic]]&quot; questions about beings to [[ontological]] questions about Being, and recover what he claimed was the most &quot;primordial&quot; and fundamental philosophical question: the question of [[Being]], of what it means for something to be</span>
				<span class='text'>Heidegger claimed that we must approach the question of Being through an inquiry into the being that has an understanding of Being, and asks the question about it, namely, Human being, which Heidegger called [[Dasein]] (&quot;being-there&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>Heidegger argued that Dasein is defined by Care, its practically engaged and concernful mode of [[Heideggerian terminology#Being-in-the-world|Being-in-the-world]], in opposition to [[Rationalist]] thinkers like [[René Descartes]] who located the essence of man in our thinking abilities</span>
				<span class='text'>For Heidegger thinking is thinking ''about'' things originally discovered in our everyday practical engagements</span>
				<span class='text'>The consequence of this is that our capacity to think cannot be the most central quality of our being because thinking is a reflecting upon this more original way of discovering the world</span>
				<span class='text'>In the second division, Heidegger argues that human being is even more fundamentally structured by its [[Temporality]], or its concern with, and relationship to [[time]], existing as a structurally open &quot;possibility-for-being</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He emphasized the importance of [[Authenticity (philosophy)|Authenticity]] in human existence, involving a truthful relationship to our [[thrownness]] into a world which we are  &quot;always already&quot; concerned with, and to our [[Heideggerian terminology#Being-toward-death|Being-towards-death]], the Finitude of the time and being we are given, and the closing down of our various possibilities for being through time</span>

				<span class='text'>quot; Heidegger's later work is especially notable for its important criticisms of [[technology]]'s instrumentalist understanding in the [[Western mystery tradition|Western tradition]] as &quot;[[enframing]],&quot; treating all of [[Nature]] as a &quot;standing reserve&quot; on call for human purposes</span>

				<span class='text'>Raised a [[Roman Catholic]], he was the son of the [[Sexton (office)|sexton]] of the village church that adhered to the [[First Vatican Council]] of 1870, which was observed mainly by the poorer class of Meßkirch</span>
				<span class='text'>His family could not afford to send him to university, so he entered a [[Jesuit]] [[seminary]], though he was turned away within weeks because of the health requirement and what the director and doctor of the seminary described as a [[psychosomatic]] heart condition</span>
				<span class='text'>Heidegger was short and sinewy, with dark piercing eyes</span>
				<span class='text'>He enjoyed outdoor pursuits, being especially proficient at skiing</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Studying theology at the [[Albert-Ludwigs-Universität|University of Freiburg]] while supported by the church on the understanding that he would defend their doctrine, Heidegger broke with Catholicism and switched his field of study to philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>He completed his doctoral thesis on [[psychologism]] in 1914, influenced by [[Neo-Thomism]] and [[Neo-Kantianism]], and in 1916 finished his ''[[venia legendi]]'' with a thesis on [[Duns Scotus]] influenced by [[Heinrich Rickert]] and [[Edmund Husserl]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In the two years following, he worked first as an unsalaried [[Privatdozent]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He served as a soldier during the final year of [[World War I]], working behind a desk and never leaving Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>During the 1930s, critics of Heidegger's espousal of a Nazi-style rhetoric of martial manliness noted the unheroic nature of his service in WW1</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Note, however, that it was discovered later that one of the two main sources used by Heidegger was not by Scotus, but by [[Thomas of Erfurt]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus Heidegger's 1916 doctoral thesis, ''Die Kategorien- und Bedeutungslehre des Duns Scotus'', should have been entitled, ''Die Kategorienlehre des Duns Scotus und die Bedeutungslehre des Thomas von Erfurt''</span>

				<span class='text'>Following on from [[Aristotle]], he began to develop in his lectures the main theme of his philosophy: the question of the sense of being</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Julian Young, Heidegger, Philosophy, Nazism (Cambridge University Press, 1997, page 3)&lt;/ref&gt;According to historian Richard J</span>
				<span class='text'>Evans, Heidegger was not only a member of the Nazi party, but was enthusiastic about participating</span>
				<span class='text'>He wanted to position himself as the philosopher of the party, but the highly abstract nature of his work and the opposition of [[Alfred Rosenberg]], who himself aspired to act in that position, limited Heidegger's role</span>
				<span class='text'>His resignation from the rectorate owed more to his frustration as an administrator than to any principled opposition to the Nazis</span>

				<span class='text'>=Philosophy=====Being, time, and ''Dasein''===Heidegger's philosophy is founded on the attempt to conjoin what he considers two fundamental insights: the first is his observation that, in the course of over 2,000 years of history, philosophy has attended to all the beings that can be found in the world (including the world itself), but has forgotten to ask what Being itself is</span>
				<span class='text'>Heidegger thought the presence of things for us is not their being, but merely them interpreted as equipment according to a particular system of meaning and purpose</span>
				<span class='text'>For instance, when a hammer is efficiently used to knock in nails, we cease to be aware of it</span>
				<span class='text'>This is termed &quot;ready to hand&quot;, and Heidegger considers it an authentic mode, saying that the given (&quot;past&quot;) has presence in an oversimplified way when reduced to possible future usefulness to us</span>
				<span class='text'>eidegger claimed philosophy and science since ancient Greece had reduced things to their presence, which was a superficial way of understanding them</span>
				<span class='text'>One crucial source of this insight was Heidegger's reading of [[Franz Brentano]]'s treatise on Aristotle's manifold uses of the word &quot;being&quot;, a work which provoked Heidegger to ask what kind of unity underlies this multiplicity of uses</span>
				<span class='text'>Heidegger opens his magnum opus, ''Being and Time'', with a citation from [[Plato]]'s ''[[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]]''&lt;ref&gt;For a study on Heidegger's reading of the ''Sophist'' and his less central interest in Plato's ''Timaeus'' and its conception of ''space'' qua ''khôra'': see: [[Nader El-Bizri]], &quot;''On kai khôra'': Situating Heidegger between the ''Sophist'' and the ''Timaeus''&quot;, ''Studia Phaenomenologica'', Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>IV, Issue 1–2 (2004), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>73–98</span>
				<span class='text'> This study is also closely connected with an investigation of Heidegger's later reflections on 'dwelling' as set in: [[Nader El-Bizri]], 'Being at Home Among Things: Heidegger’s Reflections on Dwelling', Environment, Space, Place 3 (2011), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>47–71</span>
				<span class='text'> Refer also to other aspects of this research under the section of 'Heidegger and Eastern Thought', and also the influence on architectural thinking in the main body of the text above&lt;/ref&gt; indicating that Western philosophy has neglected Being because it was considered obvious, rather than as worthy of question</span>
				<span class='text'>Heidegger's intuition about the question of Being is thus a historical argument, which in his later work becomes his concern with the &quot;history of Being&quot;, that is, the history of the forgetting of Being, which according to Heidegger requires that philosophy retrace its footsteps through a productive [[Heideggerian terminology|destruction]] of the history of philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>he second intuition animating Heidegger's philosophy derives from the influence of [[Edmund Husserl]], a philosopher largely uninterested in questions of philosophical history</span>
				<span class='text'>Rather, Husserl argued that all that philosophy could and should be is a description of experience (hence the phenomenological slogan, &quot;to the things themselves&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>But for Heidegger, this meant understanding that experience is [[world disclosure|always already situated in a world]] and in ways of being</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus Husserl's understanding that all consciousness is &quot;[[intentionality|intentional]]&quot; (in the sense that it is always intended ''toward'' something, and is always &quot;about&quot; something) is transformed in Heidegger's philosophy, becoming the thought that all experience is grounded in &quot;care&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>This is the basis of Heidegger's &quot;existential analytic&quot;, as he develops it in ''Being and Time''</span>
				<span class='text'>Heidegger argues that describing experience properly entails finding the being for whom such a description might matter</span>
				<span class='text'>Heidegger thus conducts his description of experience with reference to &quot;''[[Dasein]]''&quot;, the being for whom Being is a question</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;In everyday German, &quot;''Dasein''&quot; means &quot;existence</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; It is composed of &quot;''Da''&quot; (here/there) and &quot;''Sein''&quot; (being)</span>
				<span class='text'>''Dasein'' is transformed in Heidegger's usage from its everyday meaning to refer, rather, to that being that is ''there'' in its world, that is, the being for whom being matters</span>
				<span class='text'>In later publications Heidegger writes the term in hyphenated form as ''Da-sein'', thus emphasizing the distance from the word's ordinary usage</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In ''Being and Time'', Heidegger criticized the abstract and metaphysical character of traditional ways of grasping human existence as rational animal, person, man, soul, spirit, or subject</span>
				<span class='text'>''Dasein'', then, is not intended as a way of conducting a [[philosophical anthropology]], but is rather understood by Heidegger to be the condition of possibility for anything ''like'' a philosophical anthropology</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jacques Derrida describes this in the following terms: &quot;We can see then that Dasein, though ''not'' man, is nevertheless ''nothing other'' than man</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Jacques Derrida, &quot;The Ends of Man&quot;, ''Margins of Philosophy'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1982), p</span>
				<span class='text'>127</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; ''Dasein'', according to Heidegger, ''is'' care</span>
				<span class='text'>In the course of his existential analytic, Heidegger argues that ''Dasein'', who finds itself [[thrownness|thrown into the world]] (''Geworfenheit'') amidst things and with others, is thrown into its possibilities, including the possibility and inevitability of one's own mortality</span>
				<span class='text'>The need for ''Dasein'' to assume these possibilities, that is, the need to be responsible for one's own existence, is the basis of Heidegger's notions of authenticity and resoluteness—that is, of those specific possibilities for ''Dasein'' which depend on escaping the &quot;vulgar&quot; temporality of calculation and of public life</span>
				<span class='text'>he marriage of these two observations depends on the fact that each of them is essentially concerned with time</span>
				<span class='text'>That ''Dasein'' is thrown into an already existing world and thus into its mortal possibilities does not only mean that ''Dasein'' is an essentially temporal being; it also implies that the description of ''Dasein'' can only be carried out in terms inherited from the Western tradition itself</span>
				<span class='text'>For Heidegger, unlike for Husserl, philosophical terminology could not be divorced from the history of the use of that terminology, and thus genuine philosophy could not avoid confronting questions of language and meaning</span>
				<span class='text'>The existential analytic of ''Being and Time'' was thus always only a first step in Heidegger's philosophy, to be followed by the &quot;dismantling&quot; (''Destruktion'') of the history of philosophy, that is, a transformation of its language and meaning, that would have made of the existential analytic only a kind of &quot;limit case&quot; (in the sense in which special relativity is a limit case of general relativity)</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}That Heidegger did not write this second part of ''Being and Time'', and that the existential analytic was left behind in the course of Heidegger's subsequent writings on the history of being, might be interpreted as a failure to conjugate his account of ''individual'' experience with his account of the vicissitudes of the ''collective'' human adventure that he understands the Western philosophical tradition to be</span>
				<span class='text'>And this would in turn raise the question of whether this failure is due to a flaw in Heidegger's account of temporality, that is, of whether Heidegger was correct to oppose vulgar and authentic time</span>

				<span class='text'>fm?id=24212&lt;/ref&gt;Heidegger focuses less on the way in which the structures of being are revealed in everyday behavior, and more on the way in which behaviour itself depends on a prior &quot;openness to being</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The essence of being human is the maintenance of this openness</span>
				<span class='text'>Heidegger contrasts this openness to the &quot;will to power&quot; of the modern human subject, which is one way of forgetting this originary openness</span>
				<span class='text'>eidegger understands the commencement of the history of Western philosophy as a brief period of authentic openness to being, during the time of the [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratics]], especially [[Anaximander]], [[Heraclitus]], and [[Parmenides]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This was followed, according to Heidegger, by a long period increasingly dominated by the forgetting of this initial openness, a period which commences with [[Plato]], and which occurs in different ways throughout Western history</span>
				<span class='text'>wo recurring themes of Heidegger's later writings are poetry and technology</span>
				<span class='text'>Heidegger sees poetry and technology as two contrasting ways of &quot;revealing</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Poetry reveals being in the way in which, if it is genuine poetry, it commences something new</span>
				<span class='text'>Technology, on the other hand, when it gets going, inaugurates the world of the dichotomous subject and object, which modern philosophy commencing with Descartes also reveals</span>
				<span class='text'>But with ''modern'' technology a new stage of revealing is reached, in which the subject-object distinction is overcome even in the &quot;material&quot; world of technology</span>
				<span class='text'>The essence of modern technology is the conversion of the whole universe of beings into an undifferentiated &quot;standing reserve&quot; (''Bestand'') of energy available for any use to which humans choose to put it</span>
				<span class='text'>Heidegger described the essence of modern technology as ''[[Gestell]]'', or &quot;enframing</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Heidegger does not unequivocally condemn technology: while he acknowledges that modern technology contains grave dangers, Heidegger nevertheless also argues that it may constitute a chance for human beings to enter a new epoch in their relation to being</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite this, some commentators have insisted that an agrarian nostalgia permeates his later work</span>

				<span class='text'>Heidegger claimed to have revived the question of being, the question having been largely forgotten by the [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] tradition extending from [[Plato]] to [[Descartes]], a forgetfulness extending to the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and then to modern science and technology</span>
				<span class='text'>In pursuit of the retrieval of this question, Heidegger spent considerable time reflecting on [[Greek philosophy|ancient Greek thought]], in particular on Plato, [[Parmenides]], [[Heraclitus]], and Anaximander, as well as on the tragic playwright [[Sophocles]]</span>

				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}Of the influence of Dilthey, [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] writes the following: &quot;As far as Dilthey is concerned, we all know today what I have known for a long time: namely that it is a mistake to conclude on the basis of the citation in ''Being and Time'' that Dilthey was especially influential in the development of Heidegger's thinking in the mid-1920s</span>
				<span class='text'>This dating of the influence is much too late</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He adds that by the fall of 1923 it was plain that Heidegger felt &quot;the clear superiority of [[Paul Yorck von Wartenburg|Count Yorck]] over the famous scholar, Dilthey</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Gadamer nevertheless makes clear that Dilthey's influence was important in helping the youthful Heidegger &quot;in distancing himself from the systematic ideal of Neo-Kantianism, as Heidegger acknowledges in ''Being and Time''</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Georg Gadamer, &quot;Martin Heidegger's One Path&quot;, in Theodore Kisiel &amp; John van Buren (eds</span>
				<span class='text'>, ''Reading Heidegger from the Start: Essays in His Earliest Thought'' (Albany: SUNY Press, 1994), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>22–4</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Based on Heidegger's earliest lecture courses, in which Heidegger already engages Dilthey's thought prior to the period Gadamer mentions as &quot;too late&quot;, scholars as diverse as [[Theodore Kisiel]] and [[David Farrell Krell]] have argued for the importance of Diltheyan concepts and strategies in the formation of Heidegger's thought</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;In ''The Genesis of Heidegger's Being and Time'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1993), Theodor Kisiel designates the first version of the project that culminates in ''Being and Time'', &quot;the Dilthey draft&quot; (p</span>
				<span class='text'>313)</span>
				<span class='text'>David Farrell Krell comments in ''Daimon Life: Heidegger and Life-Philosophy'' (Bloomington &amp; Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, 1992) that &quot;Heidegger's project sprouts (in part, but in ''good'' part) from the soil of Dilthey's philosophy of factical-historical life&quot; (p</span>
				<span class='text'>35)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Even though Gadamer's interpretation of Heidegger has been questioned, there is little doubt that Heidegger seized upon Dilthey's concept of hermeneutics</span>
				<span class='text'>Heidegger's novel ideas about ontology required a ''gestalt'' formation, not merely a series of logical arguments, in order to demonstrate his fundamentally new paradigm of thinking, and the [[hermeneutic circle]] offered a new and powerful tool for the articulation and realization of these ideas</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}====Husserl====There is disagreement over the degree of influence that [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]] had on Heidegger's philosophical development, just as there is disagreement about the degree to which Heidegger's philosophy is grounded in phenomenology</span>
				<span class='text'>These disagreements centre upon how much of Husserlian phenomenology is contested by Heidegger, and how much this phenomenology in fact informs Heidegger's own understanding</span>
				<span class='text'>n the relation between the two figures, Gadamer wrote: &quot;When asked about phenomenology, Husserl was quite right to answer as he used to in the period directly after World War I: 'Phenomenology, that is me and Heidegger'</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Nevertheless, Gadamer noted that Heidegger was no patient collaborator with Husserl, and that Heidegger's &quot;rash ascent to the top, the incomparable fascination he aroused, and his stormy temperament surely must have made Husserl, the patient one, as suspicious of Heidegger as he always had been of [[Max Scheler]]'s volcanic fire</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Georg Gadamer, &quot;Martin Heidegger—75 Years&quot;, ''Heidegger's Ways'' (Albany: SUNY Press, 1994), p</span>
				<span class='text'>18</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Robert J</span>
				<span class='text'>Dostal understood the importance of Husserl to be profound:&lt;blockquote&gt;Heidegger himself, who is supposed to have broken with Husserl, bases his hermeneutics on an account of time that not only parallels Husserl's account in many ways but seems to have been arrived at through the same phenomenological method as was used by Husserl</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> The differences between Husserl and Heidegger are significant, but if we do not see how much it is the case that Husserlian phenomenology provides the framework for Heidegger's approach, we will not be able to appreciate the exact nature of Heidegger's project in ''Being and Time'' or why he left it unfinished</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Robert J</span>
				<span class='text'>Dostal, &quot;Time and Phenomenology in Husserl and Heidegger&quot;, in Charles Guignon (ed</span>

				<span class='text'>142</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Daniel O</span>
				<span class='text'>Dahlstrom saw Heidegger's presentation of his work as a departure from Husserl as unfairly misrepresenting Husserl's own work</span>
				<span class='text'>Dahlstrom concluded his consideration of the relation between Heidegger and Husserl as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;Heidegger's silence about the stark similarities between his account of temporality and Husserl's investigation of internal time-consciousness contributes to a ''misrepresentation'' of Husserl's account of intentionality</span>
				<span class='text'>Contrary to the criticisms Heidegger advances in his lectures, intentionality (and, by implication, the meaning of 'to be') in the final analysis is not construed by Husserl as sheer presence (be it the presence of a fact or object, act or event)</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet for all its &quot;dangerous closeness&quot; to what Heidegger understands by temporality, Husserl's account of internal time-consciousness does differ fundamentally</span>
				<span class='text'>In Husserl's account the structure of protentions is accorded neither the finitude nor the primacy that Heidegger claims are central to the original future of ecstatic-horizonal temporality</span>

				<span class='text'>244</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;====Kierkegaard====Heideggerians regarded [[Søren Kierkegaard]] as, by far, the greatest philosophical contributor to Heidegger's own existentialist concepts</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Dreyfus, Hubert</span>
				<span class='text'>''Being-in-the-world: A Commentary on Heidegger's Being and Time, Division I</span>
				<span class='text'>'  (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1991), Sec</span>
				<span class='text'>Appendix</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Heidegger's concepts of anxiety (''[[Angst]]'') and mortality draw on Kierkegaard and are indebted to the way in which the latter lays out the importance of our subjective relation to truth, our existence in the face of death, the temporality of existence, and the importance of passionate affirmation of one's individual [[being-in-the-world]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;A recent study touches specifically on the ontological aspects of angst from a Heideggerian standpoint and the nuances that distinguish it in a radical way from the take on ''anguish'' in Kierkegaard's thought, see: [[Nader El-Bizri]], ‘Variations ontologiques autour du concept d’angoisse chez Kierkegaard’, in ''Kierkegaard notre contemporain paradoxal'' (Beirut, 2013), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>83–95&lt;/ref&gt;====Hölderlin and Nietzsche====[[Friedrich Hölderlin]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] were both important influences on Heidegger,&lt;ref&gt;Historical Dictionary of Heidegger's Philosophy, By Frank Schalow, Alfred Denker&lt;/ref&gt; and many of his lecture courses were devoted to one or the other, especially in the 1930s and 1940s</span>
				<span class='text'>The lectures on Nietzsche focused on fragments posthumously published under the title ''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]]'', rather than on Nietzsche's published works</span>
				<span class='text'>Heidegger read ''The Will to Power'' as the culminating expression of Western metaphysics, and the lectures are a kind of dialogue between the two thinkers</span>
				<span class='text'>he fundamental differences between the philosophical delineations of Heidegger and [[Adorno]] can be found in their contrasting views of Hölderlin's poetical works and to a lesser extent in their divergent views on [[German romanticism]] in general</span>
				<span class='text'>For Heidegger, Hölderlin expressed the intuitive necessity of metaphysical concepts as a guide for ethical paradigms, devoid of reflection</span>
				<span class='text'>Adorno, on the other hand, pointed to the dialectic reflection of historical situations, the sociological interpretations of future outcomes, and therefore opposed the liberating principles of intuitive concepts because they negatively surpassed the perception of societal realities</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;This is also the case for the lecture courses devoted to the poetry of Friedrich Hölderlin, which became an increasingly central focus of Heidegger's work and thought</span>
				<span class='text'>Heidegger grants to Hölderlin a singular place within the history of being and the history of Germany, as a herald whose thought is yet to be &quot;heard&quot; in Germany or the West</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of Heidegger's works from the 1930s onwards include meditations on lines from Hölderlin's poetry, and several of the lecture courses are devoted to the reading of a single poem (see, for example, ''[[Hölderlin's Hymn &quot;The Ister&quot;]]'')</span>
				<span class='text'>==Heidegger and Eastern thought===Some writers on Heidegger's work see possibilities within it for dialogue with traditions of thought outside of Western philosophy, particularly East Asian thinking</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite perceived differences between Eastern and Western philosophy, some of Heidegger's later work, particularly &quot;A Dialogue on Language between a Japanese and an Inquirer&quot;, does show an interest in initiating such a dialogue</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Heidegger, &quot;A Dialogue on Language between a Japanese and an Inquirer&quot;, in ''On the Way to Language'' (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1971)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Heidegger himself had contact with a number of leading Japanese intellectuals, including members of the [[Kyoto School]], notably [[Hajime Tanabe]] and [[Kuki Shūzō]]</span>
				<span class='text'> It has also been claimed that a number of elements within Heidegger's thought bear a close parallel to Eastern philosophical ideas, particularly [[Zen Buddhism]] and [[Taoism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Reinhard May records Chang Chung-Yuan saying that &quot;Heidegger is the only Western Philosopher who not only intellectually understands but has intuitively grasped Taoist thought</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; May sees great influence of Taoism and Japanese scholars in Heidegger's work, although this influence is not acknowledged by the author</span>
				<span class='text'>He asserts: &quot;The investigation concludes that Heidegger’s work was significantly influenced by East Asian sources</span>
				<span class='text'>It can be shown, moreover, that in particular instances Heidegger even appropriated wholesale and almost verbatim major ideas from the German translations of Daoist and Zen Buddhist classics</span>
				<span class='text'>This clandestine textual appropriation of non-Western spirituality, the extent of which has gone undiscovered for so long, seems quite unparalleled, with far-reaching implications for our future interpretation of Heidegger’s work</span>

				<span class='text'>In the published version, Heidegger refers to the &quot;inner truth and greatness&quot; of the National Socialist movement (''die innere Wahrheit und Größe dieser Bewegung''), but he then adds a qualifying statement in parentheses: &quot;namely, the confrontation of planetary technology and modern humanity&quot; (''nämlich die Begegnung der planetarisch bestimmten Technik und des neuzeitlichen Menschen'')</span>
				<span class='text'>However, it subsequently transpired that this qualification had not been made during the original lecture, although Heidegger claimed that it had been</span>
				<span class='text'>This has led scholars to argue that Heidegger still supported the Nazi party in 1935 but that he did not want to admit this after the war, and so he attempted to silently correct his earlier statement</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; however, in public lectures, he seems to have continued to make ambiguous comments which, if they expressed criticism of the regime, did so only in the context of praising its ideals</span>
				<span class='text'>For instance, in a 1942 lecture, published posthumously, Heidegger said of recent German classics scholarship:&lt;blockquote&gt;In the majority of &quot;research results,&quot; the Greeks appear as pure National Socialists</span>
				<span class='text'>This overenthusiasm on the part of academics seems not even to notice that with such &quot;results&quot; it does National Socialism and its historical uniqueness no service at all, not that it needs this anyhow</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;An important witness to Heidegger's continued allegiance to National Socialism during the post-rectorship period is his former student [[Karl Löwith]], who met Heidegger in 1936 while Heidegger was visiting Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>In an account set down in 1940 (though not intended for publication), Löwith recalled that Heidegger wore a swastika pin to their meeting, though Heidegger knew that Löwith was Jewish</span>
				<span class='text'>Löwith also recalled that Heidegger &quot;left no doubt about his faith in [[Hitler]]&quot;, and stated that his support for National Socialism was in agreement with the essence of his philosophy</span>

				<span class='text'>Heidegger's former lover [[Arendt]] spoke on his behalf at this hearing, while [[Karl Jaspers|Jaspers]] spoke against him</span>
				<span class='text'>The result of the hearings was that Heidegger was forbidden to teach between 1945 and 1951</span>
				<span class='text'>One consequence of this teaching ban was that Heidegger began to engage far more in the French philosophical scene</span>

				<span class='text'>1 (Paris: Albin Michel, 2001)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In his postwar thinking, Heidegger distanced himself from Nazism, but his critical comments about Nazism seem &quot;scandalous&quot; to some since they tend to equate the Nazi war atrocities with other inhumane practices related to [[Rationalization (sociology)|rationalisation]] and [[industrialisation]], including the treatment of animals by [[factory farming]]</span>
				<span class='text'>For instance in a lecture delivered at Bremen in 1949, Heidegger said: &quot;Agriculture is now a motorized food industry, the same thing in its essence as the production of corpses in the gas chambers and the extermination camps, the same thing as blockades and the reduction of countries to famine, the same thing as the manufacture of hydrogen bombs</span>

				<span class='text'>Second, he admitted that he saw an &quot;awakening&quot; (''Aufbruch'') which might help to find a &quot;new national and social approach,&quot; but said that he changed his mind about this in 1934, largely prompted by the violence of the [[Night of the Long Knives]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n his interview Heidegger defended as [[double-speak]] his 1935 lecture describing the &quot;inner truth and greatness of this movement</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He affirmed that Nazi informants who observed his lectures would understand that by &quot;movement&quot; he meant National Socialism</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Heidegger asserted that his dedicated students would know this statement was no eulogy for the NSDAP</span>
				<span class='text'>Rather, he meant it as he expressed it in the parenthetical clarification later added to ''Introduction to Metaphysics'' (1953), namely, &quot;the confrontation of planetary technology and modern humanity</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;The Löwith account from 1936 has been cited to contradict the account given in the ''Der Spiegel'' interview in two ways: that he did not make any decisive break with National Socialism in 1934, and that Heidegger was willing to entertain more profound relations between his philosophy and political involvement</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''Der Spiegel'' interviewers did not bring up Heidegger's 1949 quotation comparing the industrialization of agriculture to the extermination camps</span>
				<span class='text'>In fact, the interviewers were not in possession of much of the evidence now known for Heidegger's Nazi sympathies</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;For critical readings of the interview (published in 1966 as &quot;Only a God Can Save Us,&quot; ''Der Spiegel''), see the &quot;Special Feature on Heidegger and Nazism&quot; in ''Critical Inquiry'' 15:2 (Winter 1989), particularly the contributions by [[Jürgen Habermas]] and [[Maurice Blanchot|Blanchot]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The issue includes partial translations of Derrida's ''Of Spirit'' and Lacoue-Labarthe's ''Of Spirit'' and ''Heidegger, Art, and Politics: the Fiction of the Political''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Influence and reception in France==Heidegger was one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century, and his ideas have penetrated into many areas, but in France there is a very long and particular history of reading and interpreting his work which in itself resulted in deepening the impact of his thought in Continental Philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'> His influence is clear on [[Jean Beaufret]], [[:fr:François Fédier|François Fédier]], [[Dominique Janicaud]], [[Jean-Luc Marion]], [[:fr:Jean-François Courtine|Jean-François Courtine]], etc</span>
				<span class='text'>-- one cannot even read [[Derrida]] or [[Levinas]] without taking into account their critiques of Heidegger that run deep at the basis of their thinking</span>
				<span class='text'>==Existentialism and pre-war influence===Heidegger's influence on French philosophy began in the 1930s, when ''Being and Time'', &quot;What is Metaphysics?&quot; and other Heideggerian texts were read by Jean-Paul Sartre and other existentialists, as well as by thinkers such as [[Alexandre Kojève]], [[Georges Bataille]] and [[Emmanuel Levinas]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;On the history of the French translation of Heidegger's &quot;What is Metaphysics?&quot;, and on its importance to the French intellectual scene, cf</span>
				<span class='text'>Denis Hollier, &quot;Plenty of Nothing&quot;, in Hollier (ed</span>
				<span class='text'>, ''A New History of French Literature'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts, Harvard University Press, 1989), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>894–900</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Because Heidegger's discussion of ontology (the study of being) is rooted in an analysis of the mode of existence of individual human beings (''Da-sein'', or there-being), his work has often been associated with existentialism</span>
				<span class='text'>The influence of Heidegger on Sartre's ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' is marked, but Heidegger felt that Sartre had misread his work, as he argued in later texts such as the &quot;Letter on Humanism'</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; In that text, intended for a French audience, Heidegger explained this misreading in the following terms:&lt;blockquote&gt;Sartre's key proposition about the priority of ''existentia'' over ''essentia''  [that is, Sartre's statement that &quot;existence precedes essence&quot;] does, however, justify using the name &quot;existentialism&quot; as an appropriate title for a philosophy of this sort</span>
				<span class='text'>But the basic tenet of &quot;existentialism&quot; has nothing at all in common with the statement from ''Being and Time'' [that &quot;the 'essence' of Dasein lies in its existence&quot;]—apart from the fact that in ''Being and Time'' no statement about the relation of ''essentia'' and ''existentia'' can yet be expressed, since there it is still a question of preparing something precursory</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Heidegger, &quot;Letter on 'Humanism'&quot;, ''Pathmarks'' (Cambridge &amp; New York: Cambridge University Press, 1998), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>250–1</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&quot;Letter on Humanism'&quot; is often seen as a direct response to Sartre's 1945 lecture [[Existentialism is a Humanism|&quot;Existentialism is a Humanism</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;]]  Aside from merely disputing readings of his own work, however, in &quot;Letter on Humanism,'&quot; Heidegger asserts that &quot;Every humanism is either grounded in a metaphysics or is itself made to be the ground of one</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;  Heidegger's largest issue with Sartre's existential humanism is that, while it does make a humanistic 'move' in privileging existence over essence, &quot;the reversal of a metaphysical statement remains a metaphysical statement</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; From this point onward in his thought, Heidegger attempted to think beyond metaphysics to a place where the articulation of the fundamental questions of ontology were fundamentally possible: only from this point can we restore (that is, re-give [redonner]) any possible meaning to the word &quot;humanism&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>==Post-war forays into France===After the war, Heidegger was banned from university teaching for a period on account of his activities as Rector of Freiburg University</span>
				<span class='text'>He developed a number of contacts in France, where his work continued to be taught, and a number of French students visited him at [[Todtnauberg]] (see, for example, [[Jean-François Lyotard]]'s brief account in ''Heidegger and &quot;the Jews&quot;'', which discusses a Franco-German conference held in Freiburg in 1947, one step toward bringing together French and German students)</span>
				<span class='text'>Heidegger subsequently made several visits to France, and made efforts to keep abreast of developments in French philosophy by way of correspondence with [[Jean Beaufret]], an early French translator of Heidegger, and with Lucien Braun</span>
				<span class='text'>==Derrida and deconstruction===[[Deconstruction]] came to Heidegger's attention in 1967 by way of Lucien Braun's recommendation of [[Jacques Derrida]]'s work ([[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] was present at an initial discussion and indicated to Heidegger that Derrida's work came to his attention by way of an assistant)</span>
				<span class='text'>Heidegger expressed interest in meeting Derrida personally after the latter sent him some of his work</span>
				<span class='text'>There was discussion of a meeting in 1972, but this failed to take place</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=March 2011}} Heidegger's interest in Derrida is said by Braun to have been considerable (as is evident in two letters, of September 29, 1967 and May 16, 1972, from Heidegger to Braun)</span>
				<span class='text'>Braun also brought to Heidegger's attention the work of [[Michel Foucault]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Foucault's relation to Heidegger is a matter of considerable difficulty; Foucault acknowledged Heidegger as a philosopher whom he read but never wrote about</span>
				<span class='text'>(For more on this see ''Penser à Strasbourg,'' Jacques Derrida, et al</span>
				<span class='text'> which includes reproductions of both letters and an account by Braun, &quot;À mi-chemin entre Heidegger et Derrida&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>errida attempted to displace the understanding of Heidegger's work that had been prevalent in France from the period of the ban against Heidegger teaching in German universities, which amounted to an almost wholesale rejection of the influence of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and existentialist terms</span>
				<span class='text'>In Derrida's view, deconstruction is a tradition inherited via Heidegger (the French term &quot;déconstruction&quot; is a term coined to translate Heidegger's use of the words &quot;Destruktion&quot;—literally &quot;destruction&quot;—and &quot;Abbau&quot;—more literally &quot;de-building&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Derrida, Sartre's interpretation of Dasein and other key Heideggerian concerns is overly psychologistic, anthropocentric, and misses the historicality central to ''Dasein'' in ''Being and Time''</span>
				<span class='text'>==The Farías debate===Derrida, Lacoue-Labarthe, and [[Jean-François Lyotard]], among others, all engaged in debate and disagreement about the relation between Heidegger's philosophy and his Nazi politics</span>
				<span class='text'>These debates included the question of whether it was possible to do without Heidegger's philosophy, a position which Derrida in particular rejected</span>
				<span class='text'>Forums where these debates took place include the proceedings of the first conference dedicated to Derrida's work, published as &quot;Les Fins de l'homme à partir du travail de Jacques Derrida: colloque de Cerisy, 23 juillet-2 août 1980&quot;, Derrida's &quot;Feu la cendre/cio' che resta del fuoco&quot;, and the studies on [[Paul Celan]] by Lacoue-Labarthe and Derrida which shortly preceded the detailed studies of Heidegger's politics published in and after 1987</span>
				<span class='text'>hen in 1987 [[Víctor Farías]] published his book ''Heidegger et le nazisme'', this debate was taken up by many others, some of whom were inclined to disparage so-called &quot;deconstructionists&quot; for their association with Heidegger's philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>Derrida and others not only continued to defend the importance of reading Heidegger, but attacked Farías on the grounds of poor scholarship and for what they saw as the sensationalism of his approach</span>
				<span class='text'>Not all scholars agreed with this negative assessment: [[Richard Rorty]], for example, declared that &quot;[Farías'] book includes more concrete information relevant to Heidegger's relations with the Nazis than anything else available, and it is an excellent antidote to the evasive apologetics that are still being published</span>

				<span class='text'>This is evident even from the title of Stiegler's multi-volume ''magnum opus'', ''La technique et le temps'' (volume one translated into English as ''[[Technics and Time, 1|Technics and Time, 1: The Fault of Epimetheus]]'')</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bernard Stiegler,'' Technics and Time, 1: The Fault of Epimetheus'' (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1998), part 2</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Stiegler offers an original reading of Heidegger, arguing that there can be no access to &quot;originary temporality&quot; other than via material, that is, technical, supports, and that Heidegger recognised this in the form of his account of world historicality, yet in the end suppressed that fact</span>
				<span class='text'>Stiegler understands the existential analytic of ''Being and Time'' as an account of psychic [[individuation]], and his later &quot;history of being&quot; as an account of collective individuation</span>
				<span class='text'>He understands many of the problems of Heidegger's philosophy and politics as the consequence of Heidegger's inability to integrate the two</span>
				<span class='text'>==Giorgio Agamben===Heidegger has been very influential on the work of Italian philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]]</span>

				<span class='text'>==Early criticisms===According to Husserl, ''Being and Time'' claimed to deal with ontology but only did so in the first few pages of the book</span>
				<span class='text'>Having nothing further to contribute to an ontology independent of human existence, Heidegger changed the topic to ''Dasein''</span>
				<span class='text'>Whereas Heidegger argued that the question of human existence is central to the pursuit of the question of being, Husserl criticized this as reducing phenomenology to &quot;philosophical anthropology&quot; and offering an abstract and incorrect portrait of the human being</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See Edmund Husserl, ''Psychological and transcendental phenomenology and the confrontation with Heidegger (1927–1931)'' (Dordrecht: Kluwer, 1997)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The [[Neo-Kantian]] [[Ernst Cassirer]] and Heidegger engaged in an influential debate located in [[Davos]] in 1929, concerning the significance of Kantian notions of freedom and rationality</span>
				<span class='text'>Whereas Cassirer defended the role of rationality in [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], Heidegger argued for the priority of the imagination</span>
				<span class='text'>Dilthey's student [[Georg Misch]] wrote the first extended critical appropriation of Heidegger in ''Lebensphilosophie und Phänomenologie</span>
				<span class='text'>Eine Auseinandersetzung der Diltheyschen Richtung mit Heidegger und Husserl'', Leipzig 1930 (3</span>
				<span class='text'>ed</span>
				<span class='text'>Stuttgart 1964)</span>
				<span class='text'>==Left-Hegelianism and critical theory===[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]-influenced Marxist thinkers, especially [[György Lukács]] and the [[Frankfurt School]], associated the style and content of Heidegger's thought with German irrationalism and criticized its political implications</span>
				<span class='text'>nitially members of the Frankfurt School were positively disposed to Heidegger, becoming more critical at the beginning of the 1930s</span>
				<span class='text'>Heidegger's student Herbert Marcuse became associated with the Frankfurt School</span>
				<span class='text'>Initially striving for a synthesis between Hegelian Marxism and Heidegger's phenomenology, Marcuse later rejected Heidegger's thought for its &quot;false concreteness&quot; and &quot;revolutionary conservativism</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; [[Theodor Adorno]] wrote an extended critique of the ideological character of Heidegger's early and later use of language in the ''Jargon of Authenticity''</span>
				<span class='text'>Contemporary social theorists associated with the Frankfurt School have remained largely critical of Heidegger's works and influence</span>
				<span class='text'>In particular, [[Jürgen Habermas]] admonishes the influence of Heidegger on recent French philosophy in his polemic against &quot;postmodernism&quot; in ''The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity'' (1985)</span>
				<span class='text'>However, recent work by philosopher and critical theorist [[Nikolas Kompridis]] tries to show that Heidegger's insights into [[world disclosure]] are badly misunderstood and mishandled by Habermas, and are of vital importance for critical theory, offering an important way of [[reflective disclosure|renewing that tradition]]</span>

				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt;===Reception by analytic and Anglo-American philosophy===Criticism of Heidegger's philosophy has also come from [[analytic philosophy]], beginning with [[logical positivism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In &quot;The Elimination of Metaphysics Through Logical Analysis of Language&quot; (1932), [[Rudolf Carnap]] accused Heidegger of offering an &quot;illusory&quot; ontology, criticizing him for committing the fallacy of [[Reification (fallacy)|reification]] and for wrongly dismissing the logical treatment of language which, according to Carnap, can only lead to writing &quot;nonsensical pseudo-propositions</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;The British logical positivist [[A</span>
				<span class='text'>J</span>
				<span class='text'>Ayer]] was strongly critical of Heidegger's philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>In Ayer's view, Heidegger proposed vast, overarching theories regarding existence, which are completely unverifiable through empirical demonstration and logical analysis</span>
				<span class='text'>For Ayer, this sort of philosophy was a poisonous strain in modern thought</span>
				<span class='text'>He considered Heidegger to be the worst example of such philosophy, which Ayer believed to be entirely useless</span>
				<span class='text'>[Bertrand Russell]] commented, expressing the sentiments of many mid-20th-century analytic philosophers, that:&lt;blockquote&gt;Highly eccentric in its terminology, his philosophy is extremely obscure</span>
				<span class='text'>One cannot help suspecting that language is here running riot</span>
				<span class='text'>An interesting point in his speculations is the insistence that nothingness is something positive</span>
				<span class='text'>As with much else in Existentialism, this is a psychological observation made to pass for logic</span>

				<span class='text'>303</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Roger Scruton]] stated that:  &quot;His major work ''Being and Time'' is formidably difficult—unless it is utter nonsense, in which case it is laughably easy</span>
				<span class='text'>I am not sure how to judge it, and have read no commentator who even begins to make sense of it&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>7</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The analytic tradition values clarity of expression</span>
				<span class='text'>Heidegger, however, has on occasion appeared to take an opposing view, stating for example:&lt;blockquote&gt;those in the crossing must in the end know what is mistaken by all urging for intelligibility: that every thinking of being, all philosophy, can ''never'' be confirmed by &quot;facts,&quot; i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> by beings</span>
				<span class='text'>Making itself intelligible is suicide for philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>Those who idolize &quot;facts&quot; never notice that their idols only shine in a borrowed light</span>
				<span class='text'>They are also meant not to notice this; for thereupon they would have to be at a loss and therefore useless</span>
				<span class='text'>But idolizers and idols are used wherever gods are in flight and so announce ''their'' nearness</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Apart from the charge of [[obscurantism]], other analytic philosophers considered the actual content of Heidegger's work to be either faulty and meaningless, vapid or uninteresting</span>

				<span class='text'>Some questions raised about Heidegger's philosophy include the priority of ontology, the status of animals, the nature of the religious, Heidegger's supposed neglect of ethics (Levinas), the body ([[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]]), sexual difference ([[Luce Irigaray]]), or space ([[Peter Sloterdijk]])</span>
				<span class='text'>evinas was deeply influenced by Heidegger, and yet became one of his fiercest critics, contrasting the infinity of the good beyond being with the immanence and totality of ontology</span>
