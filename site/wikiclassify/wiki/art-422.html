				<span class='text'>He spent much of his early life at [[Avignon]] and nearby [[Carpentras]], where his family moved to follow [[Pope Clement V]] who moved there in 1309 to begin the [[Avignon Papacy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He studied law at the [[University of Montpellier]] (1316–20) and [[Bologna]] (1320–23) with a lifelong friend and schoolmate called Guido Sette</span>
				<span class='text'>Because his father was in the profession of law he insisted that Petrarch and his brother study law also</span>
				<span class='text'>Petrarch however was primarily interested in writing and [[Latin literature]] and considered these seven years wasted</span>
				<span class='text'>Additionally he proclaimed that through legal manipulation his guardians robbed him of his small property inheritance in Florence, which only reinforced his dislike for the legal system</span>
				<span class='text'>He protested, &quot;I couldn't face making a merchandise of my mind&quot;, as he viewed the legal system as the art of selling justice</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bishop&quot;/&gt;Petrarch was a prolific letter writer and counted [[Boccaccio]] among his notable friends to whom he wrote often</span>
				<span class='text'>After the death of their parents, Petrarch and his brother Gherardo went back to [[Avignon]] in 1326, where he worked in numerous clerical offices</span>
				<span class='text'>This work gave him much time to devote to his writing</span>
				<span class='text'>With his first large scale work, ''[[Africa (Petrarch)|Africa]]'', an [[Epic poetry|epic]] in [[Latin]] about the great Roman general [[Scipio Africanus]], Petrarch emerged as a European celebrity</span>
				<span class='text'>On April 8, 1341, he became the first [[poet laureate]] since antiquity and was crowned by Roman ''Senatori'' [[Giordano Orsini (Senatore 1341)|Giordano Orsini]] and Orso dell'Anguillara on the holy grounds of [[Rome's Capitol]]</span>

				<span class='text'>It was no great feat, of course; but he was the first recorded [[Mountaineering|Alpinist]] of modern times, the first to climb a mountain merely for the delight of looking from its top</span>
				<span class='text'>(Or almost the first; for in a high pasture he met an old shepherd, who said that fifty years before he had attained the summit, and had got nothing from it save toil and repentance and torn clothing</span>

				<span class='text'>173&lt;/ref&gt;While Petrarch's poetry was set to music frequently after his death, especially by Italian [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]] composers of the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] in the 16th century, only one musical setting composed during Petrarch's lifetime survives</span>
				<span class='text'>This is ''Non al suo amante'' by [[Jacopo da Bologna]], written around 1350</span>
				<span class='text'>==Laura and poetry===On April 6, 1327,&lt;ref&gt;April 6, 1327 is often thought to be [[Good Friday]] based on poems 3 and 211 of Petrarch's ''[[Il Canzoniere]]'', but in fact that date fell on Monday in 1327</span>
				<span class='text'>The apparent explanation is that Petrarch was not referring to the variable date of Good Friday but to the date fixed by the death of Christ in absolute time, which at the time was thought to be April 6 (Mark Musa, ''Petrarch's Canzoniere'', Indiana University Press, 1996, p</span>
				<span class='text'>522)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; after Petrarch gave up his vocation as a priest, the sight of a woman called &quot;[[Laura (given name)|Laura]]&quot; in the church of Sainte-Claire d'[[Avignon]] awoke in him a lasting passion, celebrated in the ''Rime sparse'' (&quot;Scattered rhymes&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>Later, Renaissance poets who copied Petrarch's style named this collection of 366 poems ''[[Il Canzoniere]]'' (&quot;Song Book&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>Laura may have been [[Laura de Noves]], the wife of Count [[Hugues de Sade]] (an ancestor of the [[Marquis de Sade]])</span>
				<span class='text'>There is little definite information in Petrarch's work concerning Laura, except that she is lovely to look at, fair-haired, with a modest, dignified bearing</span>
				<span class='text'>Laura and Petrarch had little or no personal contact</span>
				<span class='text'>According to his &quot;Secretum&quot;, she refused him for the very proper reason that she was already married to another man</span>
				<span class='text'>He channeled his feelings into love poems that were exclamatory rather than persuasive, and wrote prose that showed his contempt for men who pursue women</span>
				<span class='text'> Upon her death in 1348, the poet found that his [[grief]] was as difficult to live with as was his former despair</span>
				<span class='text'> Later in his &quot;Letter to Posterity&quot;, Petrarch wrote: &quot;In my younger days I struggled constantly with an overwhelming but pure love affair – my only one, and I would have struggled with it longer had not premature death, bitter but salutary for me, extinguished the cooling flames</span>
				<span class='text'>I certainly wish I could say that I have always been entirely free from desires of the flesh, but I would be lying if I did&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Francesco Petrarca01</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|200px|&lt;center&gt;[[Laura de Noves]]]]While it is possible she was an idealized or pseudonymous character – particularly since the name &quot;Laura&quot; has a [[Linguistics|linguistic]] connection to the poetic &quot;laurels&quot; Petrarch coveted – Petrarch himself always denied it</span>
				<span class='text'>His frequent use of ''l'aura'' is also remarkable: for example, the line &quot;Erano i capei d'oro a ''l'aura'' sparsi&quot; may both mean &quot;her hair was all over Laura's body&quot;, and &quot;the wind (&quot;l'aura&quot;) blew through her hair&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>There is psychological realism in the description of Laura, although Petrarch draws heavily on conventionalised descriptions of love and lovers from [[troubadour]] songs and other literature of [[courtly love]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Her presence causes him unspeakable joy, but his unrequited love creates unendurable desires, inner conflicts between the ardent lover and the [[Christian mysticism|mystic Christian]], making it impossible to reconcile the two</span>
				<span class='text'>Petrarch's quest for love leads to hopelessness and irreconcilable anguish, as he expresses in the series of paradoxes in Rima 134 &quot;Pace non trovo, et non ò da far guerra;/e temo, et spero; et ardo, et son un ghiaccio&quot;: &quot;I find no peace, and yet I make no war:/and fear, and hope: and burn, and I am ice&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>tm#_Toc10863123&lt;/ref&gt;Laura is unreachable – the few physical descriptions are vague, almost impalpable as the love he pines for, and such is perhaps the power of his verse, which lives off the melodies it evokes against the fading, diaphanous image that is no more consistent than a ghost</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Francesco De Sanctis (critic)|Francesco De Sanctis]] remarks much the same thing in his ''Storia della letteratura italiana'', and contemporary critics agree on the powerful music of his verse</span>
				<span class='text'>Perhaps the poet was inspired by a famous singer he met in [[Veneto]] around 1350's</span>

				<span class='text'>Sensuality and passion are suggested rather by the rhythm and music that shape the vague contours of the lady</span>

				<span class='text'>]Petrarch's is a world apart from [[Dante]] and his ''[[Divina Commedia]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>In spite of the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] subject, the ''Commedia'' is deeply rooted in the cultural and social milieu of turn-of-the-century [[Florence]]: Dante's rise to power (1300) and exile (1302), his political passions call for a &quot;violent&quot; use of language, where he uses all the registers, from low and trivial to sublime and philosophical</span>
				<span class='text'>Petrarch confessed to Boccaccio that he had never read the ''Commedia'', remarks Contini, wondering whether this was true or Petrarch wanted to distance himself from Dante</span>
				<span class='text'>Dante's language evolves as he grows old, from the courtly love of his early stilnovistic ''Rime'' and ''Vita nuova'' to the ''Convivio'' and ''Divina Commedia'', where [[Beatrice Portinari|Beatrice]] is sanctified as the goddess of philosophy – the philosophy announced by the Donna Gentile at the death of Beatrice</span>

				<span class='text'>nsulaeuropea</span>
				<span class='text'>u/pulsoni/il_metodo_di_lavoro</span>
				<span class='text'>df&lt;/ref&gt;In contrast, Petrarch's thought and style are relatively uniform throughout his life – he spent much of it revising the songs and sonnets of the ''[[Il Canzoniere|Canzoniere]]'' rather than moving to new subjects or poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>Here, poetry alone provides a consolation for personal grief, much less philosophy or politics (as in Dante), for Petrarch fights within himself (sensuality versus [[mysticism]], profane versus [[Christian]] literature), not against anything outside of himself</span>
				<span class='text'>The strong moral and political convictions which had inspired Dante belong to the Middle Ages and the libertarian spirit of the [[Medieval commune|commune]]; Petrarch's moral dilemmas, his refusal to take a stand in politics, his reclusive life point to a different direction, or time</span>
				<span class='text'>The free commune, the place that had made Dante an eminent politician and scholar, was being dismantled: the ''signoria'' was taking its place</span>
				<span class='text'>Humanism and its spirit of empirical inquiry, however, were making progress – but the papacy (especially after Avignon) and the empire ([[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VII]], the last hope of the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|white Guelphs]], died near Siena in 1313) had lost much of their original prestige</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;http://petrarch</span>
				<span class='text'>oregon</span>
				<span class='text'>du/&lt;/ref&gt;Petrarch polished and perfected the sonnet form inherited from [[Giacomo da Lentini]] and which Dante widely used in his ''[[Vita nuova]]'' to popularise the new courtly love of the ''[[Dolce Stil Novo]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The tercet benefits from Dante's [[terza rima]] (compare the ''Divina Commedia''), the [[quatrain]]s prefer the ABBA-ABBA to the ABAB-ABAB scheme of the [[Sicily#Demographics|Sicilians]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The imperfect rhymes of ''u'' with closed ''o'' and ''i'' with closed ''e'' (inherited from Guittone's mistaken rendering of [[Sicilian School|Sicilian verse]]) are excluded, but the rhyme of open and closed ''o'' is kept</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally, Petrarch's [[enjambment]] creates longer semantic units by connecting one line to the following</span>
				<span class='text'>The vast majority (317) of Petrarch's 366 poems collected in the ''[[Canzoniere]]'' (dedicated to Laura) were ''sonnets'', and the [[Petrarchan sonnet]] still bears his name</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In his work ''[[Secretum (book)|Secretum meum]]'' he points out that [[secular]] achievements did not necessarily preclude an authentic relationship with [[God]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Petrarch argued instead that God had given humans their vast intellectual and creative potential to be used to their fullest</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He inspired humanist philosophy which led to the intellectual flowering of the Renaissance</span>
				<span class='text'>He believed in the immense moral and practical value of the study of ancient history and literature – that is, the study of human thought and action</span>
				<span class='text'>Petrarch was a devout Catholic and did not see a conflict between realizing humanity's potential and having [[religious faith]]</span>
				<span class='text'> highly introspective man, he shaped the nascent humanist movement a great deal because many of the internal conflicts and musings expressed in his writings were seized upon by Renaissance humanist philosophers and argued continually for the next 200 years</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, Petrarch struggled with the proper relation between the active and contemplative life, and tended to emphasize the importance of solitude and study</span>
				<span class='text'>In a clear disagreement with Dante, in 1346 Petrarch argued in his ''[[De vita solitaria]]'' that [[Pope Celestine V]]'s refusal of the papacy in 1294 was as a virtuous example of solitary life</span>
