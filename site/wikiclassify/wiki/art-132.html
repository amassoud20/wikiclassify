				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, he received accolades and state awards and served in the [[Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR]] (1947–1962) and the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]] (from 1962 until his death)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;!-- Paragraph 2: musical style --&gt;A [[polystylism|poly-stylist]], Shostakovich developed a hybrid voice, combining a variety of different musical techniques into his music</span>
				<span class='text'>Shostakovich's music is characterized by sharp contrasts, elements of the [[grotesque]], and ambivalent [[tonality]]; the composer was also heavily influenced by the [[neo-classical music|neo-classical]] style pioneered by [[Igor Stravinsky]], and (especially in his symphonies) by the [[Post-romanticism|post-Romanticism]] associated with [[Gustav Mahler]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;!-- Paragraph 3: overview of compositions --&gt;Shostakovich's orchestral works include 15 [[symphony|symphonies]] and six [[concerti]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His chamber output includes 15 [[string quartet]]s, a [[piano quintet]], two [[piano trio]]s, and two pieces for string octet</span>
				<span class='text'>His piano works include two solo [[sonata]]s, an early set of [[prelude (music)|preludes]], and a later set of [[24 Preludes and Fugues (Shostakovich)|24 preludes and fugues]]</span>

				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|right|Birthplace of Shostakovich (now School No</span>
				<span class='text'>267)</span>
				<span class='text'>Commemorative plaque at left]]Born at Podolskaya street in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], Shostakovich was the second of three children of Dmitri Boleslavovich Shostakovich and Sofiya Vasilievna Kokoulina</span>
				<span class='text'>Shostakovich's paternal grandfather, originally surnamed Szostakowicz, was of [[Poles|Polish]] [[Roman Catholic]] descent (his family roots trace to the region of the town of [[Vileyka]] in today's [[Belarus]]), but his immediate forebears came from [[Siberia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Laurel Fay (2000), ''Shostakovich: A Life'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>7&lt;/ref&gt; A Polish revolutionary in the [[January Uprising]] of 1863–4, Bolesław Szostakowicz would be exiled to [[Narym]] (near [[Tomsk]]) in 1866 in the crackdown that followed [[Dmitry Karakozov|Dmitri Karakozov]]'s assassination attempt on [[Alexander II of Russia|Tsar Alexander II]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Wilson4&gt;Elizabeth Wilson, ''Shostakovich: A Life Remembered'' (2006), p</span>
				<span class='text'>4&lt;/ref&gt; When his term of exile ended, Szostakowicz decided to remain in Siberia</span>
				<span class='text'>He eventually became a successful banker in [[Irkutsk]] and raised a large family</span>
				<span class='text'>His son, Dmitri Boleslavovich Shostakovich, the composer's father, was born in exile in Narim in 1875 and studied physics and mathematics in [[Saint Petersburg University]], graduating in 1899</span>
				<span class='text'>He then went to work as an engineer under [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] at the Bureau of Weights and Measures in Saint Petersburg</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1903, he married another Siberian transplant to the capital, Sofiya Vasilievna Kokoulina, one of six children born to a Russian Siberian native</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Wilson4/&gt;Their son, Dmitri Dmitriyevich Shostakovich, displayed significant musical talent after he began piano lessons with his mother at the age of nine</span>
				<span class='text'>On several occasions, he displayed a remarkable ability to remember what his mother had played at the previous lesson, and would get &quot;caught in the act&quot; of playing the previous lesson's music while pretending to read different music placed in front of him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Laurel Fay (2000), p</span>
				<span class='text'>9&lt;/ref&gt; In 1918, he wrote a funeral march in memory of two leaders of the [[Constitutional Democratic party|Kadet party]], murdered by [[Bolshevik]] sailors</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Laurel Fay (2000), p</span>
				<span class='text'>12&lt;/ref&gt;In 1919, at the age of thirteen, he was allowed to enter the [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory|Petrograd Conservatory]], then headed by [[Alexander Glazunov]], who monitored Shostakovich's progress closely and promoted him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Laurel Fay (2000), p</span>
				<span class='text'>17&lt;/ref&gt; Shostakovich studied piano with [[Leonid Nikolayev (pianist)|Leonid Nikolayev]] after a year in the class of Elena Rozanova, composition with [[Maximilian Steinberg]], and [[counterpoint]] and [[fugue]] with [[Nikolay Sokolov (composer)|Nikolay Sokolov]], with whom he became friends</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Laurel Fay (2000), p</span>
				<span class='text'>18&lt;/ref&gt; Shostakovich also attended [[Alexander Ossovsky]]'s history of music classes</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge Companion to Shostakovich, [[Cambridge Companions to Music]]'' by Pauline Fairclough (Editor), David Fanning (Editor)</span>
				<span class='text'>Cambridge University Press; 1 edition (17 November 2008) p</span>
				<span class='text'>3&lt;/ref&gt; Steinberg tried to guide Shostakovich in the path of the great Russian composers, but was disappointed to see him 'wasting' his talent and imitating [[Igor Stravinsky]] and [[Sergei Prokofiev]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also suffered for his perceived lack of political zeal, and initially failed his exam in [[Marxism|Marxist]] methodology in 1926</span>
				<span class='text'>His first major musical achievement was the [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>1 (Shostakovich)|First Symphony]] (premiered 1926), written as his graduation piece at the age of nineteen</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Dmitrij Dmitrijevič Šostakovič (Дми́трий Дми́триевич Шостако́вич)</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|Shostakovich in 1925]]=== Early career ===After graduation, Shostakovich initially embarked on a dual career as concert pianist and composer, but his dry style of playing was often unappreciated (his American biographer, Laurel Fay, comments on his &quot;emotional restraint&quot; and &quot;riveting rhythmic drive&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>He nevertheless won an &quot;honorable mention&quot; at the First [[International Chopin Piano Competition]] in Warsaw in 1927</span>
				<span class='text'>He explained the disappointment at the competition to suffering from appendicitis and the jury being all-Polish</span>
				<span class='text'>He later had his appendix removed in April 1927</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;David Fanning, &quot;Dmitry Shostakovich&quot;, second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (professor of music) |John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001) </span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; After the competition Shostakovich met the conductor [[Bruno Walter]], who was so impressed by the composer's [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>1 (Shostakovich)|First Symphony]] that he conducted it at its Berlin premiere later that year</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Leopold Stokowski]] was equally impressed and gave the work its U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>premiere the following year in Philadelphia and also made the work's first recording</span>
				<span class='text'>hereafter, Shostakovich concentrated on composition and soon limited his performances primarily to those of his own works</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1927 he wrote his [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>2 (Shostakovich)|Second Symphony]] (subtitled ''To October''), a patriotic piece with a great pro-Soviet choral finale</span>
				<span class='text'>Due to its [[avant-garde|experimental nature]], as with the subsequent [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>3 (Shostakovich)|Third Symphony]], the pieces were not critically acclaimed with the enthusiasm granted to the First</span>
				<span class='text'>he year 1927 also marked the beginning of Shostakovich's relationship with [[Ivan Sollertinsky]], who remained his closest friend until the latter's death in 1944</span>
				<span class='text'>Sollertinsky introduced the composer to the music of [[Gustav Mahler]], which had a strong influence on his music from the [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>4 (Shostakovich)|Fourth Symphony]] onwards</span>
				<span class='text'>hile writing the Second Symphony, Shostakovich also began work on his [[satire|satirical]] opera ''[[The Nose (opera)|The Nose]]'', based on the story by [[Nikolai Gogol|Gogol]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In June 1929, the opera was given a concert performance, against Shostakovich's own wishes, and was ferociously attacked by the [[Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians]] (RAPM)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wilson (2006): p</span>
				<span class='text'>84&lt;/ref&gt; Its stage premiere on 18 January 1930 opened to generally poor reviews and widespread incomprehension amongst musicians</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wilson (2006): p</span>
				<span class='text'>85&lt;/ref&gt;In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Shostakovich worked at [[Workers' Youth Theatre|TRAM]], a [[proletariat|proletarian]] youth theatre</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he did little work in this post, it shielded him from ideological attack</span>
				<span class='text'>Much of this period was spent writing his opera, ''[[Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District (opera)|Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District]]'', which was first performed in 1934</span>
				<span class='text'>It was immediately successful, on both popular and official levels</span>
				<span class='text'>It was described as &quot;the result of the general success of Socialist construction, of the correct policy of the Party&quot;, and as an opera that &quot;could have been written only by a Soviet composer brought up in the best tradition of Soviet culture&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumbnail|''Muddle instead of music'', article published on Pravda on 18 January 1936, harshly criticizing Shostakovich's Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk</span>
				<span class='text'>]In 1936, Shostakovich fell from official favour</span>
				<span class='text'>The year began with a series of attacks on him in ''[[Pravda]]'', in particular an article entitled, &quot;[[Muddle Instead of Music]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Shostakovich was away on a concert tour in [[Arkhangelsk]] when he heard news of the first ''Pravda'' article</span>
				<span class='text'>Two days before the article was published on the evening of 28 January,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Classical Music |url=http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>tml |title=When opera was a matter of life or death |publisher=Telegraph |date= 8 March 2004|accessdate=7 November 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; a friend had advised Shostakovich to attend the [[Bolshoi Theatre]] production of ''Lady Macbeth''</span>
				<span class='text'>When he arrived, he saw that [[Joseph Stalin]] and the [[Politburo]] were there</span>
				<span class='text'>In letters written to his friend [[Ivan Sollertinsky]], Shostakovich recounted the horror with which he watched as Stalin shuddered every time the brass and percussion played too loudly</span>
				<span class='text'>Equally horrifying was the way Stalin and his companions laughed at the love-making scene between Sergei and Katerina</span>
				<span class='text'>Eyewitness accounts testify that Shostakovich was &quot;white as a sheet&quot; when he went to take his bow after the third act</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Wilson, ''Shostakovich: A Life Remembered'' (Princeton, NJ: Princeton UP, 2006), 128–129&lt;/ref&gt;The article condemned ''Lady Macbeth'' as formalist, &quot;coarse, primitive and vulgar&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McBurney, p</span>
				<span class='text'>287</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, commissions began to fall off, and his income fell by about three quarters</span>
				<span class='text'>Even Soviet music critics who had praised the opera were forced to recant in print, saying they &quot;failed to detect the shortcomings of ''Lady Macbeth'' as pointed out by ''Pravda''&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>12 April 1936</span>
				<span class='text'>p</span>
				<span class='text'>X5</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the &quot;Muddle Instead of Music&quot; article, ''Pravda'' published another, &quot;Ballet Falsehood,&quot; that criticized Shostakovich’s ballet ''The Limpid Stream''</span>
				<span class='text'>Shostakovich did not expect this second article because the general public and press already accepted this music as &quot;democratic&quot;&amp;nbsp;– that is, tuneful and accessible</span>
				<span class='text'>However, ''Pravda'' criticized ''The Limpid Stream'' for incorrectly displaying peasant life on the collective farm</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''Shostakovich: A Life Remembered'', 130&lt;/ref&gt;More widely, 1936 marked the beginning of the [[Great Purge|Great Terror]], in which many of the composer's friends and relatives were imprisoned or killed</span>
				<span class='text'>These included his patron [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky|Marshal Tukhachevsky]] (shot months after his arrest); his brother-in-law [[Vsevolod Frederiks]] (a distinguished physicist, who was eventually released but died before he got home); his close friend [[Nikolai Zhilyayev (musicologist)|Nikolai Zhilyayev]] (a musicologist who had taught Tukhachevsky; shot shortly after his arrest); his mother-in-law, the astronomer Sofiya Mikhaylovna Varzar (sent to a camp in [[Karaganda]]); his friend the Marxist writer Galina Serebryakova (20 years in camps); his uncle Maxim Kostrykin (died); and his colleagues [[Boris Kornilov]] and [[Adrian Piotrovsky]] (executed)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wilson (2006): pp</span>
				<span class='text'>145–46&lt;/ref&gt; His only consolation in this period was the birth of his daughter Galina in 1936; his son [[Maxim Shostakovich|Maxim]] was born two years later</span>
				<span class='text'>=== Withdrawal of the Fourth Symphony ====The publication of the ''Pravda'' editorials coincided with the composition of Shostakovich's [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>4 (Shostakovich)|Fourth Symphony]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The work marked a great shift in style for the composer due to the substantial influence of [[Gustav Mahler]] and a number of Western-style elements</span>
				<span class='text'>The symphony gave Shostakovich compositional trouble, as he attempted to reform his style into a new idiom</span>
				<span class='text'>The composer was well into the work when the fatal articles appeared</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite this, Shostakovich continued to compose the symphony and planned a premiere at the end of 1936</span>
				<span class='text'>Rehearsals began that December, but after a number of rehearsals Shostakovich, for reasons still debated today, decided to withdraw the symphony from the public</span>
				<span class='text'>A number of his friends and colleagues, such as Isaak Glikman, have suggested that it was in fact an official ban which Shostakovich was persuaded to present as a voluntary withdrawal</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wilson (2006): pp</span>
				<span class='text'>143–44&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever the case, it seems possible that this action saved the composer's life: during this time Shostakovich feared for himself and his family</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet Shostakovich did not repudiate the work; it retained its designation as his Fourth Symphony</span>
				<span class='text'>A piano reduction was published in 1946, and the work was finally premiered in 1961, well after Stalin's death</span>
				<span class='text'>uring 1936 and 1937, in order to maintain as low a profile as possible between the Fourth and Fifth symphonies, Shostakovich mainly composed [[film music]], a genre favored by Stalin and lacking in dangerous personal expression</span>

				<span class='text'>''Testimony''</span>
				<span class='text'>New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1979: p</span>
				<span class='text'>9&lt;/ref&gt;==== &quot;A Soviet artist's creative response to just criticism&quot; ====The composer's response to his denunciation was the [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>5 (Shostakovich)|Fifth Symphony]] of 1937, which was musically more conservative than his earlier works</span>
				<span class='text'>Premiering on 21 November 1937 in Leningrad, it was a phenomenal success</span>
				<span class='text'>The Fifth drove many to tears and welling emotions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Volkov</span>
				<span class='text'>''Shostakovich and Stalin'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>50&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Shostakovich wrote in his supposed memoirs, ''[[Testimony (book)|Testimony]]'': &quot;I'll never believe that a man who understood nothing could feel the Fifth Symphony</span>
				<span class='text'>Of course they understood, they understood what was happening around them and they understood what the Fifth was about</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Volkov</span>
				<span class='text'>''Testimony'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>35&lt;/ref&gt;The success put Shostakovich in good standing once again</span>
				<span class='text'>Music critics and the authorities alike, including those who had earlier accused Shostakovich of formalism, claimed that he had learned from his mistakes and had become a true Soviet artist</span>
				<span class='text'>The composer [[Dmitry Kabalevsky]], who had been among those who disassociated himself from Shostakovich when the ''Pravda'' article was published, praised the Fifth Symphony and congratulated Shostakovich for &quot;not having given in to the seductive temptations of his previous 'erroneous' ways</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson (2006): p</span>
				<span class='text'>152&lt;/ref&gt;It was also at this time that Shostakovich composed the first of his [[string quartet]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>His [[Chamber music|chamber]] works allowed him to experiment and express ideas which would have been unacceptable in his more public symphonic pieces</span>
				<span class='text'>In September 1937, he began to teach composition at the Leningrad Conservatory, which provided some financial security but interfered with his own creative work</span>
				<span class='text'>== Second World War ===In 1939, before the [[Winter War|Soviet forces attempted to invade Finland]], the Party Secretary of Leningrad [[Andrei Zhdanov]] commissioned a celebratory piece from Shostakovich, entitled ''[[Suite on Finnish Themes]]'' to be performed as the marching bands of the [[Red Army]] would be parading through the Finnish capital [[Helsinki]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Winter War]] was a bitter experience for the Red Army, the parade never happened, and Shostakovich would never lay claim to the authorship of this work</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Edwards13&quot;&gt;[[#Edwards2006|Edwards 2006]], p</span>
				<span class='text'>98&lt;/ref&gt; It was not performed until 2001</span>

				<span class='text'>''The Leningrad Symphony conducted by Yevgeny Mravinsky'', 1980]]After the outbreak of [[Eastern Front (World War II)|war between the Soviet Union and Germany]] in 1941, Shostakovich initially remained in Leningrad</span>
				<span class='text'>He tried to enlist for the military but was turned away because of his poor eyesight</span>
				<span class='text'>To compensate, Shostakovich became a volunteer for the Leningrad Conservatory’s firefighter brigade and delivered a radio broadcast to the Soviet people ''{{Audio|ShostakovichRadio1941</span>
				<span class='text'>gg|listen}}''</span>
				<span class='text'>The photograph for which he posed was published in newspapers throughout the country</span>

				<span class='text'>171&lt;/ref&gt;But his greatest and most famous wartime contribution was the [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>7 (Shostakovich)|Seventh Symphony]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The composer wrote the first three movements in Leningrad and completed the work in [[Kuibyshev]] (now [[Samara, Russia|Samara]]) where he and his family had been evacuated</span>
				<span class='text'>Whether or not Shostakovich really conceived the idea of the symphony with the [[siege of Leningrad]] in mind, it was officially claimed as a representation of the people of Leningrad’s brave resistance to the German invaders and an authentic piece of patriotic art at a time when morale needed boosting</span>
				<span class='text'>The symphony was first premiered by the Bolshoi Theatre orchestra in Kuibyshev and was soon performed abroad in London and the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the most compelling performance was the [[Leningrad première of Shostakovich's Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>7|Leningrad premiere]] by the Radio Orchestra in the besieged city</span>
				<span class='text'>The orchestra had only fourteen musicians left, so the conductor Karl Eliasberg had to recruit anyone who could play a musical instrument to perform the symphony</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Blokker, ''Shostakovich: The Symphonies'',31&lt;/ref&gt;In spring 1943, the family moved to Moscow</span>
				<span class='text'>At the time of the [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>8 (Shostakovich)|Eighth Symphony]]'s premiere, the tide had turned for the Red Army</span>
				<span class='text'>Therefore, the public, and most importantly the authorities, wanted another triumphant piece from the composer</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, they got the Eighth Symphony, perhaps the ultimate in sombre and violent expression within Shostakovich's output</span>
				<span class='text'>In order to preserve the image of Shostakovich (a vital bridge to the people of the Union and to the West), the government assigned the name &quot;Stalingrad&quot; to the symphony, giving it the appearance of a mourning of the dead in the bloody [[Battle of Stalingrad]]</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the symphony did not escape criticism</span>
				<span class='text'>Shostakovich is reported to have said: &quot;When the Eighth was performed, it was openly declared counter-revolutionary and anti-Soviet</span>
				<span class='text'>They said, 'Why did Shostakovich write an optimistic symphony at the beginning of the war and a tragic one now? At the beginning we were retreating and now we're attacking, destroying the Fascists</span>
				<span class='text'>And Shostakovich is acting tragic, that means he's on the side of the fascists</span>

				<span class='text'>[[Israel Nestyev]] asked whether it was the right time for &quot;a light and amusing interlude between Shostakovich's significant creations, a temporary rejection of great, serious problems for the sake of playful, filigree-trimmed trifles</span>

				<span class='text'>152&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New York World-Telegram]] of 27 July 1946 was similarly dismissive: &quot;The Russian composer should not have expressed his feelings about the defeat of Nazism in such a childish manner&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Shostakovich continued to compose chamber music, notably his [[Piano Trio No</span>
				<span class='text'>2 (Shostakovich)|Second Piano Trio]] (Op</span>

				<span class='text'>Andrei Zhdanov, Chairman of the [[RSFSR Supreme Soviet]], accused Shostakovich and other composers (such as [[Sergei Prokofiev]] and [[Aram Khachaturian]]) for writing inappropriate and formalist music</span>
				<span class='text'>This was part of an ongoing anti-formalism campaign intended to root out all Western compositional influence as well as any perceived &quot;non-Russian&quot; output</span>
				<span class='text'>The conference resulted in the publication of the Central Committee’s Decree &quot;On V</span>
				<span class='text'>Muradeli’s opera ''The Great Friendship'',&quot; which was targeted towards all Soviet composers and demanded that they only write &quot;proletarian&quot; music, or music for the masses</span>

				<span class='text'>183</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The consequences of the decree for composers were harsh</span>
				<span class='text'>Shostakovich was among those who were dismissed from the Conservatoire altogether</span>
				<span class='text'>For Shostakovich, the loss of money was perhaps the largest blow</span>
				<span class='text'>Others still in the Conservatory experienced an atmosphere that was thick with suspicion</span>
				<span class='text'>No one wanted their work to be understood as formalist, so many resorted to accusing their colleagues of writing or performing anti-proletarian music</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''Shostakovich: A Life Remembered'', 252&lt;/ref&gt;In the next few years, he composed three categories of work: film music to pay the rent, official works aimed at securing official [[rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitation]], and serious works &quot;for the desk drawer&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The latter included the [[Violin Concerto No</span>
				<span class='text'>1 (Shostakovich)|Violin Concerto No</span>
				<span class='text'>1]] and the song cycle ''[[From Jewish Folk Poetry]]</span>
				<span class='text'>' The cycle was written at a time when the post-war [[anti-Semitic]] campaign was already under way, with widespread arrests including of I</span>
				<span class='text'>Dobrushin and Yiditsky, the compilers of the book from which Shostakovich took his texts</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wilson (2006): p</span>
				<span class='text'>69</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The restrictions on Shostakovich's music and living arrangements were eased in 1949, when Stalin decided that the Soviets needed to send artistic representatives to the Cultural and Scientific Congress for World Peace in [[New York City]], and that Shostakovich should be amongst them</span>
				<span class='text'>For Shostakovich, it was a humiliating experience culminating in a New York press conference where he was expected to read a prepared speech</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Nicolas Nabokov]], who was present in the audience, witnessed Shostakovich starting to read &quot;in a nervous and shaky voice&quot; before he had to break off &quot;and the speech was continued in English by a suave radio baritone&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>London: Hamish Hamilton, 1951: p</span>
				<span class='text'>204&lt;/ref&gt; Fully aware that Shostakovich was not free to speak his mind, Nabokov publicly asked the composer whether he supported the then recent denunciation of [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky's]] music in the Soviet Union</span>
				<span class='text'>Shostakovich, who was a great admirer of Stravinsky and had been influenced by his music, had no alternative but to answer in the affirmative</span>
				<span class='text'>Nabokov did not hesitate to publish that this demonstrated that Shostakovich was &quot;not a free man, but an obedient tool of his government</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Nabokov: p</span>
				<span class='text'>205&lt;/ref&gt; Shostakovich never forgave Nabokov for this public humiliation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wilson (2006): p</span>
				<span class='text'>274&lt;/ref&gt;  That same year Shostakovich was obliged to compose the [[cantata]] ''[[Song of the Forests]],'' which praised Stalin as the &quot;great gardener</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; In 1951 the composer was made a deputy to the [[Supreme Soviet of RSFSR]]</span>
				<span class='text'>talin's death in 1953 was the biggest step towards Shostakovich's rehabilitation as a creative artist, which was marked by his [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>10 (Shostakovich)|Tenth Symphony]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It features a number of [[musical quotations]] and codes (notably the [[DSCH (Dmitri Shostakovich)|DSCH]] and Elmira motifs, Elmira Nazirova being a pianist and composer who had studied under Shostakovich in the year prior to his dismissal from the Moscow Conservatoire),&lt;ref&gt;Wilson (2006): p</span>
				<span class='text'>304&lt;/ref&gt; the meaning of which is still debated, whilst the savage second movement, according to ''[[Testimony (book)|Testimony]]'', is intended as a musical portrait of Stalin himself</span>
				<span class='text'>The Symphony ranks alongside the Fifth and Seventh as one of his most popular works</span>
				<span class='text'>1953 also saw a stream of premieres of the &quot;desk drawer&quot; works</span>
				<span class='text'>uring the forties and fifties, Shostakovich had close relationships with two of his pupils: [[Galina Ustvolskaya]] and Elmira Nazirova</span>
				<span class='text'>In the background to all this remained Shostakovich's first, open marriage to Nina Varzar until her death in 1954</span>
				<span class='text'>He taught Ustvolskaya from 1937 to 1947</span>
				<span class='text'>The nature of their relationship is far from clear: [[Mstislav Rostropovich]] described it as &quot;tender&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Ustvolskaya rejected a proposal of marriage from him after Nina's death</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Fay (2000): p</span>
				<span class='text'>194&lt;/ref&gt; Shostakovich's daughter, Galina, recalled her father consulting her and Maxim about the possibility of Ustvolskaya becoming their stepmother</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Fay (2000): p</span>
				<span class='text'>194; Wilson (2006): p</span>
				<span class='text'>297&lt;/ref&gt; Ustvolskaya's friend, Viktor Suslin, said that she had been &quot;deeply disappointed&quot; in Shostakovich by the time of her graduation in 1947</span>
				<span class='text'>The relationship with Nazirova seems to have been one-sided, expressed largely through his letters to her, and can be dated to around 1953 to 1956</span>
				<span class='text'>He married his second wife, [[Komsomol]] activist Margarita Kainova, in 1956; the couple proved ill-matched, and divorced three years later</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1954, Shostakovich wrote the [[Festive Overture (Shostakovich)|Festive Overture, opus 96]], that was used as the theme music for the [[1980 Summer Olympics]]</span>

				<span class='text'>n 1959, Shostakovich appeared on stage in Moscow at the end of a concert performance of his Fifth Symphony, congratulating [[Leonard Bernstein]] and the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]] for their performance (part of a concert tour of the Soviet Union)</span>
				<span class='text'>Later that year, Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic recorded the symphony in Boston for [[Columbia Records]]</span>
				<span class='text'>== Joining the Party ===The year 1960 marked another turning point in Shostakovich's life: he joined the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The government wanted to appoint him General Secretary of the Composers' Union, but in order to hold that position he was required to attain Party membership</span>
				<span class='text'>It was understood that Nikita Khrushchev, the First Secretary of the Communist Party from 1958 to 1964, was looking for support from the leading ranks of the intelligentsia in an effort to create a better relationship with the Soviet Union’s artists</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''Shostakovich: A Life Remembered'', 373–380&lt;/ref&gt; This event has been interpreted variously as a show of commitment, a mark of cowardice, the result of political pressure, or as his free decision</span>
				<span class='text'>On the one hand, the [[Apparatchik|apparat]] was undoubtedly less repressive than it had been before Stalin's death</span>
				<span class='text'>On the other, his son recalled that the event reduced Shostakovich to tears,&lt;ref&gt;Ho and Feofanov, p</span>
				<span class='text'>390</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and he later told his wife Irina that he had been blackmailed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Manashir Yakubov, programme notes for the 1998 Shostakovich seasons at the [[Barbican Arts Centre|Barbican]], London)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; [[Lev Lebedinsky]] has said that the composer was suicidal</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wilson (1994), p</span>
				<span class='text'>340</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Once he joined the Party, several articles denouncing individualism in music were published in ''Pravda'' under his name, though he did not actually write them</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, in joining the party, Shostakovich was also committing himself to finally writing the homage to Lenin that he had promised before</span>
				<span class='text'>His [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>12 (Shostakovich)|Twelfth Symphony]], which portrays the Bolshevik Revolution and was completed in 1961, was dedicated to Vladimir Lenin and called &quot;The Year 1917</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ian MacDonald, ''The New Shostakovich'' (London:Plimlico, 2006), 247&lt;/ref&gt;  Around this time, his health also began to deteriorate</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|left|thumb|200px|Shostakovich in 1950]]Shostakovich's musical response to these personal crises was the [[String Quartet No</span>
				<span class='text'>8 (Shostakovich)|Eighth String Quartet]], composed in only three days</span>
				<span class='text'>He subtitled the piece, &quot;To the victims of fascism and war&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Blokker, ''Shostakovich: The Symphonies'', 37&lt;/ref&gt; ostensibly in memory of the Dresden fire bombing that took place in 1945</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet, like the Tenth Symphony, this quartet incorporates [[Musical quotation|quotations]] from several of his past works and his musical monogram: Shostakovich confessed to his friend Isaak Glikman &quot;I started thinking that if some day I die, nobody is likely to write a work in memory of me, so I had better write one myself</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Letter dated 19 July 1960, reprinted in Glikman: pp</span>
				<span class='text'>90–91&lt;/ref&gt; Several of Shostakovich's colleagues, including Natalya Vovsi-Mikhoels&lt;ref&gt;Wilson (2006): p</span>
				<span class='text'>263&lt;/ref&gt; and the cellist Valentin Berlinsky,&lt;ref&gt;Wilson (2006): p</span>
				<span class='text'>281&lt;/ref&gt; were also aware of the Eighth Quartet's biographical intent</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1962 he married for the third time, to Irina Supinskaya</span>
				<span class='text'>In a letter to Glikman, he wrote &quot;her only defect is that she is 27 years old</span>
				<span class='text'>In all other respects she is splendid: clever, cheerful, straightforward and very likeable</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Glikman: p</span>
				<span class='text'>102</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Galina Vishnevskaya]], who knew the Shostakoviches well, this marriage was a very happy one: &quot;It was with her that Dmitri Dmitriyevich finally came to know domestic peace</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Surely, she prolonged his life by several years</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Galina Vishnevskaya, ''Galina, A Russian Story'' p</span>
				<span class='text'>274</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  In November he made his only venture into conducting, conducting a couple of his own works in [[Nizhny Novgorod|Gorky]];&lt;ref&gt;Wilson (2006): pp</span>
				<span class='text'>426–27&lt;/ref&gt; otherwise he declined to conduct, citing nerves and ill health as his reasons</span>
				<span class='text'>hat year saw Shostakovich again turn to the subject of anti-Semitism in his [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>13 (Shostakovich)|Thirteenth Symphony]] (subtitled ''[[Babi Yar]]'')</span>
				<span class='text'>The symphony sets a number of poems by [[Yevgeny Yevtushenko]], the first of which commemorates a massacre of Ukrainian Jews during the Second World War</span>
				<span class='text'>Opinions are divided how great a risk this was: the poem had been published in Soviet media, and was not banned, but it remained controversial</span>
				<span class='text'>After the symphony's premiere, Yevtushenko was forced to add a stanza to his poem which said that Russians and Ukrainians had died alongside the Jews at Babi Yar</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1965 Shostakovich raised his voice in defense of poet [[Joseph Brodsky]], who was sentenced to five years of exile and hard labor</span>
				<span class='text'>Shostakovich co-signed protests together with Yevtushenko and fellow Soviet artists [[Kornei Chukovsky]], [[Anna Akhmatova]], [[Samuil Marshak]], and the French philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After the protests the sentence was commuted, and Brodsky returned to Leningrad</span>
				<span class='text'>== Later life ===In 1964 Shostakovich composed the music for the Russian film ''[[Hamlet (1964 film)|Hamlet]]'', which was favourably reviewed by the ''[[New York Times]]'': &quot;But the lack of this aural stimulation&amp;nbsp;– of Shakespeare's eloquent words&amp;nbsp;– is recompensed in some measure by a splendid and stirring musical score by Dmitri Shostakovich</span>
				<span class='text'>This has great dignity and depth, and at times an appropriate wildness or becoming levity&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Crowther, Bosley, in ''New York Times'', 15 September 1964</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In later life, Shostakovich suffered from chronic ill health, but he resisted giving up cigarettes and [[vodka]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Beginning in 1958 he suffered from a debilitating condition that particularly affected his right hand, eventually forcing him to give up piano playing; in 1965 it was diagnosed as [[poliomyelitis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also suffered [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]] the following year and again in 1971, and several falls in which he broke both his legs; in 1967 he wrote in a letter:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Target achieved so far: 75% (right leg broken, left leg broken, right hand defective)</span>
				<span class='text'>All I need to do now is wreck the left hand and then 100% of my extremities will be out of order</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Glikman p</span>
				<span class='text'>147</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;A preoccupation with his own mortality permeates Shostakovich's later works, among them the later quartets and the [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>14 (Shostakovich)|Fourteenth Symphony]] of 1969 (a song cycle based on a number of poems on the theme of death)</span>
				<span class='text'>This piece also finds Shostakovich at his most extreme with musical language, with twelve-tone themes and dense polyphony used throughout</span>
				<span class='text'>Shostakovich dedicated this score to his close friend [[Benjamin Britten]], who conducted its Western premiere at the 1970 [[Aldeburgh Festival]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>15 (Shostakovich)|Fifteenth Symphony]] of 1971 is, by contrast, melodic and retrospective in nature, quoting [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] and the composer's own Fourth Symphony</span>
				<span class='text'>hostakovich died of [[lung cancer]] on 9 August 1975 and after a civic funeral was interred in the [[Novodevichy Cemetery]], Moscow</span>
				<span class='text'>Even before his death he had been commemorated with the naming of the Shostakovich Peninsula on [[Alexander Island]], [[Antarctica]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Shostakovich himself left behind several recordings of his own piano works, while other noted interpreters of his music include his friends [[Emil Gilels]], [[Mstislav Rostropovich]], [[Tatiana Nikolayeva]], [[Maria Yudina]], [[David Oistrakh]], and members of the [[Beethoven Quartet]]</span>
				<span class='text'>is last work was his [[Viola Sonata (Shostakovich)|Viola Sonata]], which was first performed on 28 December 1975, four months after his death</span>
				<span class='text'>hostakovich's musical influence on later composers outside the former Soviet Union has been relatively slight, although [[Alfred Schnittke]] took up his eclecticism, and his contrasts between the dynamic and the static, and some of [[André Previn]]'s music shows clear links to Shostakovich's style of orchestration</span>
				<span class='text'>His influence can also be seen in some Nordic composers, such as [[Lars-Erik Larsson]]</span>

				<span class='text'>The symphonies are distributed fairly evenly throughout his career, while the quartets are concentrated towards the latter part</span>
				<span class='text'>Among the most popular are the [[Symphony No</span>

				<span class='text'>hostakovich's music shows the influence of many of the composers he most admired: [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] in his [[fugue]]s and [[passacaglia]]s; [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] in the late [[quartet]]s; [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]] in the symphonies and [[Alban Berg|Berg]] in his use of musical codes and [[Musical quotation|quotations]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Among Russian composers, he particularly admired [[Modest Mussorgsky]], whose operas ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris Godunov]]'' and ''[[Khovanshchina]]'' he [[Orchestration|re-orchestrated]]; Mussorgsky's influence is most prominent in the wintry scenes of ''Lady Macbeth'' and the [[Symphony No</span>

				<span class='text'>288, 290</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The influence of Russian church and folk music is very evident in his works for unaccompanied choir of the 1950s</span>
				<span class='text'>hostakovich's relationship with [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] was profoundly ambivalent; as he wrote to Glikman, &quot;Stravinsky the composer I worship</span>

				<span class='text'>(The meeting of the two composers was not very successful, however; observers commented on Shostakovich's extreme nervousness and Stravinsky's &quot;cruelty&quot; to him</span>

				<span class='text'>375–377</span>

				<span class='text'>88</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Key works of the earlier period are the [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>1 (Shostakovich)|First Symphony]], which combined the academicism of the conservatory with his progressive inclinations; ''[[The Nose (opera)|The Nose]]'' (&quot;The most uncompromisingly modernist of all his stage-works&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Grove p</span>
				<span class='text'>289</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;); ''[[Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District (opera)|Lady Macbeth]]</span>
				<span class='text'>' which precipitated the denunciation; and the [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>4 (Shostakovich)|Fourth Symphony]], described in Grove's Dictionary as &quot;a colossal synthesis of Shostakovich's musical development to date&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Grove p</span>
				<span class='text'>290</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The Fourth Symphony was also the first in which the influence of Mahler came to the fore, prefiguring the route Shostakovich was to take to secure his rehabilitation, while he himself admitted that the preceding two were his least successful</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Glikman p</span>
				<span class='text'>315</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In the years after 1936, Shostakovich's symphonic works were outwardly musically conservative, regardless of any subversive political content</span>
				<span class='text'>During this time he turned increasingly to [[chamber music|chamber]] works, a field that permitted the composer to explore different and often darker ideas without inviting external scrutiny</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See also Grove p</span>
				<span class='text'>294</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; While his chamber works were largely tonal, they gave Shostakovich an outlet for sombre reflection not welcomed in his more public works</span>
				<span class='text'>This is most apparent in the late chamber works, which portray what is described in Grove's Dictionary as a &quot;world of [[Purgatory|purgatorial]] numbness&quot;;&lt;ref name = &quot;wwadvp&quot;&gt;Grove p</span>
				<span class='text'>300</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; in some of these he included the use of [[tone row]]s, although he treated these as melodic themes rather than [[serialism|serially]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Vocal works are also a prominent feature of his late output, setting texts often concerned with love, death and art</span>
				<span class='text'>== Jewish themes ===Even before the Stalinist anti-Semitic campaigns in the late 1940s and early 1950s, Shostakovich showed an interest in Jewish themes</span>
				<span class='text'>He was intrigued by [[Jewish music]]’s &quot;ability to build a jolly melody on sad intonations&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''Shostakovich: A Life Remembered'', 268&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of works that included Jewish themes are the Fourth String Quartet (1949), the First Violin Concerto (1948), and the ''Four Monologues on Pushkin Poems'' (1952), as well as the Piano Trio in E minor (1944)</span>
				<span class='text'>He was further inspired to write with Jewish themes when he examined [[Moshe Beregovski|Moisei Beregovski]]’s thesis on the theme of Jewish folk music in 1946</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1948, Shostakovich acquired a book of Jewish folk songs, and from this he composed the song cycle ''From Jewish Poetry''</span>
				<span class='text'>He initially wrote eight songs that were meant to represent the hardships of being Jewish in the Soviet Union</span>
				<span class='text'>However in order to disguise this, Shostakovich ended up adding three more songs meant to demonstrate the great life Jews had under the Soviet regime</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite his efforts to hide the real meaning in the work, the [[Union of Composers]] refused to approve his music in 1949 under the pressure of the anti-Semitism that gripped the country</span>
				<span class='text'>''From Jewish Poetry'' could not be performed until after Stalin’s death in March 1953, along with all the other works that were forbidden</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''Shostakovich: A Life Remembered'', 267–269&lt;/ref&gt;=== Posthumous publications ===In 2004, the musicologist Olga Digonskaya discovered a trove of Shostakovich manuscripts at the Glinka State Central Museum of Musical Culture, Moscow</span>
				<span class='text'>In a cardboard file were some &quot;300 pages of musical sketches, pieces and scores&quot; in the hand of Shostakovich</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;A composer friend bribed Shostakovich's housemaid to regularly deliver the contents of Shostakovich's office waste bin to him, instead of taking it to the garbage</span>
				<span class='text'>Some of those cast-offs eventually found their way into the Glinka</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>The Glinka archive 'contained a huge number of pieces and compositions which were completely unknown or could be traced quite indirectly,' Digonskaya said</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=LATimes20111127/&gt;Among these were Shostakovich's piano and vocal sketches for a prologue to an opera, [[Orango (opera)|''Orango'' (1932)]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;=== Criticism ===According to Shostakovich scholar Gerard McBurney, opinion is divided on whether his music is &quot;of visionary power and originality, as some maintain, or, as others think, derivative, trashy, empty and second-hand&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McBurney, p</span>
				<span class='text'>283</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; [[William Walton]], his British contemporary, described him as &quot;the greatest composer of the 20th century&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''British Composers in Interview'' by R Murray Schafer (Faber 1960)&lt;/ref&gt; Musicologist [[David Fanning (musicologist)|David Fanning]] concludes in Grove's Dictionary that, &quot;Amid the conflicting pressures of official requirements, the mass suffering of his fellow countrymen, and his personal ideals of humanitarian and public service, he succeeded in forging a musical language of colossal emotional power</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Grove p</span>
				<span class='text'>280</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Some modern composers have been critical</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Pierre Boulez]] dismissed Shostakovich's music as &quot;the second, or even third [[Olive oil extraction#Traditional method: olive press|pressing]] of [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McBurney, p</span>
				<span class='text'>288</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The Romanian composer and [[Anton Webern|Webern]] disciple [[Philip Gershkovich]] called Shostakovich &quot;a&amp;nbsp;hack in a trance&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McBurney, p</span>
				<span class='text'>290</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  A related complaint is that Shostakovich's style is vulgar and strident: [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] wrote of ''[[Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District (opera)|Lady Macbeth]]'': &quot;brutally hammering&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>and monotonous&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McBurney, p</span>
				<span class='text'>286</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; English composer and musicologist [[Robin Holloway]] described his music as &quot;battleship-grey in melody and harmony, factory-functional in structure; in content all rhetoric and coercion</span>

				<span class='text'>For instance, he said in 1987:&lt;blockquote&gt;Shostakovich is in many ways a polar counter-force for Stravinsky</span>
				<span class='text'>[</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> When I have said that the 7th symphony of Shostakovich is a dull and unpleasant composition, people have responded: &quot;Yes, yes, but think of the background of that symphony</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Such an attitude does no good to anyone</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Salonen, Esa-Pekka &amp; Otonkoski, Lauri: ''Kirja – puhetta musiikitta'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>73</span>
				<span class='text'>Helsinki: Tammi</span>
				<span class='text'>ISBN 951-30-6599-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;However, Salonen has since performed and recorded several of Shostakovich's works, including the Piano Concertos Nos</span>
				<span class='text'>1 and 2 (1999), the Violin Concerto No</span>
				<span class='text'>1 (2010), the Prologue to &quot;Orango&quot; and the Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>4 (2012)</span>
				<span class='text'>t is certainly true that Shostakovich borrows extensively from the material and styles both of earlier composers and of [[popular music]]; the vulgarity of &quot;low&quot; music is a notable influence on this &quot;greatest of eclectics&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Haas, ''Shostakovich's Eighth: C minor Symphony against the Grain'' p</span>
				<span class='text'>125</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  McBurney traces this to the [[avant-garde]] artistic circles of the early Soviet period in which Shostakovich moved early in his career, and argues that these borrowings were a deliberate technique to allow him to create &quot;patterns of contrast, repetition, exaggeration&quot; that gave his music the large-scale structure it required</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McBurney&lt;/ref&gt;== Personality ==[[File:ShostakovichwithIvan Sollertinsky</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Shostakovich with close friend [[Ivan Sollertinsky]]]]Shostakovich was in many ways an obsessive man: according to his daughter he was &quot;obsessed with cleanliness&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ardov,''Memories of Shostakovich'' p</span>
				<span class='text'>139</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; he synchronised the clocks in his apartment; he regularly sent cards to himself to test how well the postal service was working</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Elizabeth Wilson (cellist)|Elizabeth Wilson]]'s ''Shostakovich: A Life Remembered'' (1994 edition) indexes 26 references to his nervousness</span>
				<span class='text'>Mikhail Druskin remembers that even as a young man the composer was &quot;fragile and nervously agile&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wilson (1994), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>41–45</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Yuri Lyubimov comments, &quot;The fact that he was more vulnerable and receptive than other people was no doubt an important feature of his genius&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wilson (1994), p</span>
				<span class='text'>183</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  In later life, [[Krzysztof Meyer]] recalled, &quot;his face was a bag of tics and grimaces&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wilson (1994), p</span>
				<span class='text'>462</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In his lighter moods, sport was one of his main recreations, although he preferred spectating or umpiring to participating (he was a qualified [[referee (association football)|football referee]])</span>
				<span class='text'>His favourite football club was [[Zenit Leningrad]], which he would watch regularly</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Mentioned in his personal correspondence (Shostakovich, tr</span>
				<span class='text'>Phillips (2001)), as well as other sources</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He also enjoyed playing [[card game]]s, particularly [[Solitaire|patience]]</span>
				<span class='text'>e was fond of [[satirical]] writers such as [[Gogol]], [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]] and [[Mikhail Zoshchenko]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The influence of the latter in particular is evident in his letters, which include wry parodies of Soviet [[acrolect|officialese]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Zoshchenko himself noted the contradictions in the composer's character: &quot;he is&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>frail, fragile, withdrawn, an infinitely direct, pure child&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>[but he is also] hard, acid, extremely intelligent, strong perhaps, despotic and not altogether good-natured (although cerebrally good-natured)&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Fay (2000): p</span>
				<span class='text'>121</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;He was diffident by nature: Flora Litvinova has said he was &quot;completely incapable of saying 'No' to anybody</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson (1994), p</span>
				<span class='text'>162</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  This meant he was easily persuaded to sign official statements, including a denunciation of [[Andrei Sakharov]] in 1973; on the other hand he was willing to try to help constituents in his capacities as chairman of the Composers' Union and Deputy to the Supreme Soviet</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Oleg Prokofiev]] commented that &quot;he tried to help so many people that&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>less and less attention was paid to his pleas</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson (1994): p</span>
				<span class='text'>40</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; When asked if he believed in God, Shostakovich said &quot;No, and I am very sorry about it</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Laurel Fay (2000), p</span>
				<span class='text'>263&lt;/ref&gt;== Orthodoxy and revisionism ==[[File:DSCH motif</span>
				<span class='text'>vg|thumb|Shostakovich represented himself in some works with the [[DSCH motif]], consisting of D-E{{flat}}-C-B</span>
				<span class='text'>]{{Main|Testimony (book)}}Shostakovich's response to official criticism and, what is more important, the question of whether he used music as a kind of covert dissidence is a matter of dispute</span>
				<span class='text'>He outwardly conformed to government policies and positions, reading speeches and putting his name to articles expressing the government line</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wilson (2006): pp</span>
				<span class='text'>369–70</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; But it is evident he disliked many aspects of the regime, as confirmed by his family, his letters to Isaak Glikman, and the satirical [[cantata]] &quot;[[Rayok (Shostakovich)|Rayok]]&quot;, which ridiculed the &quot;anti-formalist&quot; campaign and was kept hidden until after his death</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wilson (2006): p</span>
				<span class='text'>336&lt;/ref&gt; He was a close friend of [[Marshal of the Soviet Union]] [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]], who was executed in 1937 during the [[Great Purge]]</span>
				<span class='text'>t is also uncertain to what extent Shostakovich expressed his opposition to the state in his music</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] view was put forth by [[Solomon Volkov]] in the 1979 book ''[[Testimony (book)|Testimony]]'', which was claimed to be Shostakovich's memoirs dictated to Volkov</span>
				<span class='text'>The book alleged that many of the composer's works contained coded anti-government messages, that would place Shostakovich in a tradition of Russian artists outwitting censorship that goes back at least to the early 19th century poet [[Alexander Pushkin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It is known that he incorporated many [[Musical quotation|quotations]] and [[motif (music)|motifs]] in his work, most notably his [[musical cryptogram|signature]] [[DSCH motif|DSCH]] theme</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;This appears in several of his works, including the ''Pushkin Monologues'', Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>10, and String Quartets Nos 5, 8 &amp; 11</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; His longtime collaborator [[Yevgeny Mravinsky]] said that &quot;Shostakovich very often explained his intentions with very specific images and connotations</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson (1994), p</span>
				<span class='text'>139</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The revisionist perspective has subsequently been supported by his children, Maxim and Galina, and many Russian musicians</span>
				<span class='text'>Volkov has further argued, both in ''Testimony'' and in ''Shostakovich and Stalin'', that Shostakovich adopted the role of the ''[[yurodivy]]'' or [[holy fool]] in his relations with the government</span>
				<span class='text'>Other prominent revisionists are [[Ian MacDonald]], whose book ''The New Shostakovich'' put forward further revisionist interpretations of his music, and Elizabeth Wilson, whose ''Shostakovich: A Life Remembered'' provides testimony from many of the composer's acquaintances</span>
				<span class='text'>usicians and scholars including Laurel Fay&lt;ref&gt;Fay (2000), p</span>
				<span class='text'>4</span>
				<span class='text'> &quot;Whether ''Testimony'' faithfully reproduces Shostakovich's confidences </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>in a form and context he would have recognized and approved for publication remains doubtful</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet even were [its] claim to authenticity not in doubt, it would still furnish a poor source for the serious biographer</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Richard Taruskin]] contest the authenticity and debate the significance of ''Testimony'', alleging that Volkov compiled it from a combination of recycled articles, gossip, and possibly some information direct from the composer</span>
				<span class='text'>Fay documents these allegations in her 2002 article 'Volkov's ''Testimony'' reconsidered',&lt;ref&gt;Fay, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; showing that the only pages of the original ''Testimony'' manuscript that Shostakovich had signed and verified are word-for-word reproductions of earlier interviews given by the composer, none of which are controversial</span>
				<span class='text'>(Against this, it has been pointed out by Allan B</span>
				<span class='text'>Ho and Dmitry Feofanov that at least two of the signed pages contain controversial material: for instance, &quot;on the first page of chapter 3, where [Shostakovich] notes that the plaque that reads 'In this house lived [[Vsevolod Meyerhold|[Vsevolod] Meyerhold]]' should also say 'And in this house his wife was brutally murdered'</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;)&lt;ref&gt;Ho &amp; Feofanov, p</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|A Russian stamp in Shostakovich's memory]]In May 1958, during a visit to Paris, Shostakovich recorded his two piano concertos with [[André Cluytens]], as well as some short piano works</span>
				<span class='text'>These were issued by [[EMI]] on an LP, reissued by [[Seraphim Records]] on LP, and eventually digitally remastered and released on CD</span>
				<span class='text'>Shostakovich recorded the two concertos in stereo in Moscow for [[Melodiya]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Shostakovich also played the piano solos in recordings of the Cello Sonata, Op</span>
				<span class='text'>40 with cellist [[Daniil Shafran]] and also with [[Mstislav Rostropovich]]; the Violin Sonata, Op</span>
				<span class='text'>134, with violinist [[David Oistrakh]]; and the Piano Trio, Op</span>
				<span class='text'>67 with violinist David Oistrakh and cellist [[Miloš Sádlo]]</span>
				<span class='text'>There is also a short sound film of Shostakovich as soloist in a 1930s concert performance of the closing moments of his first piano concerto</span>
				<span class='text'>A colour film of Shostakovich supervising one of his operas, from his last year, was also made</span>

				<span class='text'>There was at least one recording of the cleaned up version, Katerina Ismailova that Shostakovich had made to satisfy Soviet censorship</span>
				<span class='text'>But when conductor Mstislav Rostropovich and his wife, soprano [[Galina Vishnevskaya]] were finally allowed to emigrate to the West, the composer begged them to record the full original score, which they did in 1979</span>
				<span class='text'>It features Vishnevskaya as Katerina, [[Nicolai Gedda]] as Sergei, Dimiter Petkov as Boris Ismailov and a brilliant supporting cast under Rostropovich's direction</span>
