				<span class='text'>He usually gave the year as 1900 when speaking in public (although he used 1901 on his Social Security and other papers filed with the government)</span>
				<span class='text'>Using [[Roman Catholic Church]] documents from when his grandmother took him to be baptized, New Orleans music researcher [[Tad Jones]] established Armstrong's actual date of birth as August 4, 1901</span>
				<span class='text'>With various other pieces of collaborative evidence, this date is now accepted by Armstrong scholars</span>
				<span class='text'>See also ''[[age fabrication]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Pops''', was an American [[jazz]] trumpeter, composer and singer who was one of the pivotal and most influential figures in jazz music</span>
				<span class='text'>His career spanned from the 1920s to the 1960s, covering many different eras of jazz</span>
				<span class='text'>oming to prominence in the 1920s as an &quot;inventive&quot; [[trumpet]] and [[cornet]] player, Armstrong was a foundational influence in jazz, shifting the focus of the music from collective improvisation to solo performance{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}</span>
				<span class='text'>With his instantly recognizable gravelly voice, Armstrong was also an influential singer, demonstrating great dexterity as an improviser, bending the lyrics and melody of a song for expressive purposes</span>
				<span class='text'>He was also skilled at [[scat singing]]</span>
				<span class='text'>enowned for his charismatic stage presence and voice almost as much as for his trumpet-playing, Armstrong's influence extends well beyond jazz music, and by the end of his career in the 1960s, he was widely regarded as a profound influence on popular music in general</span>
				<span class='text'>Armstrong was one of the first truly popular African-American entertainers to &quot;cross over&quot;, whose skin color was secondary to his music in an America that was extremely racially divided</span>
				<span class='text'>He rarely publicly politicized his race, often to the dismay of fellow African-Americans, but took a well-publicized stand for [[desegregation]] during the [[Little Rock Nine|Little Rock Crisis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His artistry and personality allowed him socially acceptable access to the upper echelons of American society which were highly restricted for [[Black people|black men]] of his era</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Armstrong was born into a poor family in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], and was the grandson of slaves</span>
				<span class='text'>He spent his youth in poverty, in a rough neighborhood known as &quot;the Battlefield&quot;, which was part of the [[Storyville, New Orleans|Storyville]] legal prostitution district</span>
				<span class='text'>His father, William Armstrong (1881–1922), abandoned the family when Louis was an infant and took up with another woman</span>
				<span class='text'>His mother, Mary &quot;Mayann&quot; Albert (1886–1927), then left Louis and his younger sister, Beatrice Armstrong Collins (1903–1987), in the care of his grandmother, Josephine Armstrong, and at times, his Uncle Isaac</span>
				<span class='text'>At five, he moved back to live with his mother and her relatives, and only saw his father in parades</span>
				<span class='text'>He attended the Fisk School for Boys, where he most likely had early exposure to music</span>
				<span class='text'>He brought in some money as a paperboy and also by finding discarded food and selling it to restaurants, but it was not enough to keep his mother from prostitution</span>
				<span class='text'>He hung out in dance halls close to home, where he observed everything from licentious dancing to the [[quadrille]]</span>
				<span class='text'>For extra money he also hauled coal to Storyville, and listened to the bands playing in the brothels and dance halls, especially Pete Lala's, where [[Joe &quot;King&quot; Oliver]] performed as well as other famous musicians who would drop in to [[jam session|jam]]</span>
				<span class='text'>fter dropping out of the Fisk School at age eleven, Armstrong joined a quartet of boys who sang in the streets for money</span>
				<span class='text'>He also started to get into trouble</span>
				<span class='text'>Cornet player [[Bunk Johnson]] said he taught Armstrong (then 11) to play by ear at Dago Tony's [[Honky tonk|Tonk]] in New Orleans,&lt;ref&gt;''Current Biography 1944'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>15–17</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; although in his later years Armstrong gave the credit to Oliver</span>
				<span class='text'>Armstrong hardly looked back at his youth as the worst of times but drew inspiration from it instead: &quot;Every time I close my eyes blowing that trumpet of mine—I look right in the heart of good old New Orleans</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; instilled discipline in and provided musical training to the otherwise self-taught Armstrong</span>
				<span class='text'>Eventually, Davis made Armstrong the band leader</span>
				<span class='text'>The home band played around New Orleans and the thirteen-year-old Louis began to draw attention by his cornet playing, starting him on a musical career</span>

				<span class='text'>78</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; At fourteen he was released from the home, living again with his father and new step-mother, Gertrude,  and then back with his mother and thus back to the streets and their temptations</span>
				<span class='text'>Armstrong got his first dance hall job at Henry Ponce's where [[Black Benny]] became his protector and guide</span>
				<span class='text'>He hauled coal by day and played his cornet at night</span>
				<span class='text'>e played in the city's frequent [[brass band]] parades and listened to older musicians every chance he got, learning from [[Bunk Johnson]], [[Buddy Petit]], [[Kid Ory]], and above all, [[Joe &quot;King&quot; Oliver]], who acted as a mentor and father figure to the young musician</span>
				<span class='text'>Later, he played in [[brass bands]] and [[riverboat]]s of New Orleans, and began traveling with the well-regarded band of [[Fate Marable]], which toured on a [[steamboat]] up and down the [[Mississippi River]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He described his time with Marable as &quot;going to the University,&quot; since it gave him a much wider experience working with written [[arrangement]]s</span>

				<span class='text'>At twenty, he could read music and started to be featured in extended trumpet solos, one of the first jazz men to do this, injecting his own personality and style into his solo turns</span>
				<span class='text'>He had learned how to create a unique sound and also started using singing and patter in his performances</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bergreen, 1997, p</span>
				<span class='text'>170</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, Armstrong joined the exodus to Chicago, where he had been invited by his mentor, Joe &quot;King&quot; Oliver, to join his Creole Jazz Band and where he could make a sufficient income so that he no longer needed to supplement his music with day labor jobs</span>
				<span class='text'>It was a boom time in Chicago and though race relations were poor, the city was teeming with jobs available also for [[black people]], who were making good wages in factories and had plenty to spend on entertainment</span>
				<span class='text'>liver's band was among the most influential jazz bands in Chicago in the early 1920s, at a time when Chicago was the center of the jazz universe</span>
				<span class='text'>Armstrong lived luxuriously in Chicago, in his own apartment with his own private bath (his first)</span>
				<span class='text'>Excited as he was to be in Chicago, he began his career-long pastime of writing nostalgic letters to friends in New Orleans</span>
				<span class='text'>As Armstrong's reputation grew, he was challenged to &quot;cutting contests&quot; by hornmen trying to displace the new phenomenon{{clarify|date=October 2015}}, who could blow two hundred high Cs in a row</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bergreen, 1997, p</span>
				<span class='text'>199</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Armstrong made his first recordings on the [[Gennett Records|Gennett]] and [[Okeh Records|Okeh]] labels (jazz records were starting to boom across the country), including taking some solos and breaks, while playing second cornet in Oliver's band in 1923</span>
				<span class='text'>At this time, he met [[Hoagy Carmichael]] (with whom he would collaborate later) who was introduced by friend [[Bix Beiderbecke]], who now had his own Chicago band</span>
				<span class='text'>rmstrong enjoyed working with Oliver, but Louis' second wife, pianist [[Lil Hardin Armstrong]], urged him to seek more prominent billing and develop his newer style away from the influence of Oliver</span>
				<span class='text'>Armstrong took the advice of his wife and left Oliver's band</span>
				<span class='text'>For a year Armstrong played in [[Fletcher Henderson]]'s band in New York on many recordings</span>
				<span class='text'>After playing in New York, Armstrong returned to Chicago, playing in large orchestras; there he created his most important early recordings</span>

				<span class='text'>Lil's influence eventually undermined Armstrong's relationship with his mentor, especially concerning his salary and additional moneys that Oliver held back from Armstrong and other band members</span>
				<span class='text'>Armstrong and Oliver parted amicably in 1924</span>
				<span class='text'>Shortly afterward, Armstrong received an invitation to go to New York City to play with the [[Fletcher Henderson]] Orchestra, the top African-American band of the time</span>
				<span class='text'>Armstrong switched to the trumpet to blend in better with the other musicians in his section</span>
				<span class='text'>His influence upon Henderson's [[tenor saxophone|tenor sax]] soloist, [[Coleman Hawkins]], can be judged by listening to the records made by the band during this period</span>
				<span class='text'>rmstrong quickly adapted to the more tightly controlled style of Henderson, playing trumpet and even experimenting with the trombone</span>
				<span class='text'>The other members quickly took up Armstrong's emotional, expressive pulse</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon his act included singing and telling tales of New Orleans characters, especially preachers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bergreen, 1997, p</span>
				<span class='text'>247</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The Henderson Orchestra was playing in prominent venues for white-only patrons, including the famed [[Roseland Ballroom]], featuring the arrangements of [[Don Redman]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Duke Ellington]]'s orchestra would go to Roseland to catch Armstrong's performances and young horn men around town tried in vain to outplay him, splitting their lips in their attempts</span>
				<span class='text'>uring this time, Armstrong made many recordings on the side, arranged by an old friend from New Orleans, pianist [[Clarence Williams (musician)|Clarence Williams]]; these included small jazz band sides with the Williams Blue Five (some of the most memorable pairing Armstrong with one of Armstrong's few rivals in fiery technique and ideas, [[Sidney Bechet]]) and a series of accompaniments with blues singers, including [[Bessie Smith]], [[Ma Rainey]], and [[Alberta Hunter]]</span>
				<span class='text'>rmstrong returned to Chicago in 1925 due mostly to the urging of his wife, who wanted to pump up Armstrong's career and income</span>
				<span class='text'>He was content in New York but later would concede that she was right and that the Henderson Orchestra was limiting his artistic growth</span>
				<span class='text'>In publicity, much to his chagrin, she billed him as &quot;the World's Greatest Trumpet Player&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>At first, he was actually a member of the Lil Hardin Armstrong Band and working for his wife</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bergreen, 1997, p</span>
				<span class='text'>260</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He began recording under his own name for Okeh with his famous [[Louis Armstrong and his Hot Five|Hot Five]] and [[Louis Armstrong and his Hot Seven|Hot Seven]] groups, producing hits such as &quot;[[Potato Head Blues]]&quot;, &quot;[[Muggles (recording)|Muggles]]&quot;, (a reference to [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], for which Armstrong had a lifelong fondness), and &quot;[[West End Blues]]&quot;, the music of which set the standard and the agenda for jazz for many years to come</span>
				<span class='text'>he group included [[Kid Ory]] (trombone), [[Johnny Dodds]] (clarinet), [[Johnny St</span>
				<span class='text'>Cyr]] (banjo), wife Lil on piano, and usually no drummer</span>
				<span class='text'>Armstrong's band leading style was easygoing, as St</span>
				<span class='text'>Cyr noted, &quot;One felt so relaxed working with him, and he was very broad-minded </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>always did his best to feature each individual</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bergreen, 1997, p</span>
				<span class='text'>274</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Among the most notable of the Hot Five and Seven records were &quot;Cornet Chop Suey,&quot; &quot;Struttin' With Some Barbecue,&quot; &quot;Hotter Than that&quot; and &quot;Potato Head Blues,&quot;, all featuring highly creative solos by Armstrong</span>
				<span class='text'>His recordings soon after with pianist [[Earl Hines|Earl &quot;Fatha&quot; Hines]] (most famously their 1928 &quot;Weatherbird&quot; duet) and Armstrong's trumpet introduction to and solo in &quot;West End Blues&quot; remain some of the most famous and influential improvisations in jazz history</span>
				<span class='text'>Armstrong was now free to develop his personal style as he wished, which included a heavy dose of effervescent jive, such as &quot;whip that thing, Miss Lil&quot; and &quot;Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Johnny Dodds, Aw, do that clarinet, boy!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bergreen, 1997, p</span>
				<span class='text'>264</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Armstrong also played with [[Erskine Tate]]'s Little Symphony, which played mostly at the Vendome Theatre</span>
				<span class='text'>They furnished music for silent movies and live shows, including jazz versions of classical music, such as &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot;, which gave Armstrong experience with longer forms of music and with hosting before a large audience</span>
				<span class='text'>He began to scat sing (improvised vocal jazz using nonsensical words) and was among the first to record it, on the Hot Five recording &quot;[[Heebie Jeebies (composition)|Heebie Jeebies]]&quot; in 1926</span>
				<span class='text'>The recording was so popular that the group became the most famous jazz band in the United States, even though they had not performed live to any great extent</span>
				<span class='text'>Young musicians across the country, black or white, were turned on by Armstrong's new type of jazz</span>

				<span class='text'>Armstrong's famous interpretation of Carmichael's &quot;[[Stardust (song)|Stardust]]&quot; became one of the most successful versions of this song ever recorded, showcasing Armstrong's unique vocal sound and style and his innovative approach to singing songs that had already become standards</span>
				<span class='text'>rmstrong's radical re-working of [[Sidney Arodin]] and Carmichael's &quot;[[Lazy River]]&quot; (recorded in 1931) encapsulated many features of his groundbreaking approach to melody and phrasing</span>
				<span class='text'>The song begins with a brief trumpet solo, then the main melody is introduced by sobbing horns, memorably punctuated by Armstrong's growling interjections at the end of each bar: &quot;Yeah! </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot;Uh-huh&quot; </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot;Sure&quot; </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Way down, way down</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; In the first verse, he ignores the notated melody entirely and sings as if playing a trumpet solo, pitching most of the first line on a single note and using strongly syncopated phrasing</span>
				<span class='text'>In the second stanza he breaks into an almost fully improvised melody, which then evolves into a classic passage of Armstrong &quot;[[scat singing]]&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>The uniquely gritty coloration of his voice became a musical archetype that was much imitated and endlessly impersonated</span>
				<span class='text'>His scat singing style was enriched by his matchless experience as a trumpet soloist</span>
				<span class='text'>His resonant, velvety lower-register tone and bubbling cadences on sides such as &quot;Lazy River&quot; exerted a huge influence on younger white singers such as Bing Crosby</span>
				<span class='text'>he [[Great Depression]] of the early 1930s was especially hard on the jazz scene</span>

				<span class='text'>The band drew the Hollywood crowd, which could still afford a lavish night life, while radio broadcasts from the club connected with younger audiences at home</span>
				<span class='text'>Bing Crosby and many other celebrities were regulars at the club</span>

				<span class='text'>Armstrong also began to experience problems with his fingers and lips, which were aggravated by his unorthodox playing style</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, he branched out, developing his vocal style and making his first theatrical appearances</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|Louis Armstrong in 1953]]During the 1940s, a widespread revival of interest in the traditional jazz of the 1920s made it possible for Armstrong to consider a return to the small-group musical style of his youth</span>
				<span class='text'>Following a highly successful small-group jazz concert at New York Town Hall on May 17, 1947, featuring Armstrong with trombonist/singer [[Jack Teagarden]], Armstrong's manager, Joe Glaser dissolved the Armstrong big band on August 13, 1947 and established a six-piece traditional jazz small group featuring Armstrong with (initially) Teagarden, [[Earl Hines]] and other top swing and Dixieland musicians, most of them ex-big band leaders</span>

				<span class='text'>He was the first jazz musician to appear on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, on February 21, 1949</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1948, he participated in the [[Nice Jazz Festival]], where [[Suzy Delair]] sang &quot;[[C'est si bon]]&quot;, by [[Henri Betti]] and [[André Hornez]], for the first time in public</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|Selmer trumpet, given as a gift by [[King George V]] of the United Kingdom to Louis Armstrong in 1933]]In his early years, Armstrong was best known for his virtuosity with the cornet and trumpet</span>
				<span class='text'>The most lauded recordings on which Armstrong plays trumpet include the [[Louis Armstrong Hot Five and Hot Seven Sessions|Hot Five and Hot Seven sessions]], as well as those of the [[Red Onion Jazz Babies]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Armstrong's improvisations, while unconventionally sophisticated for that era, were also subtle and highly melodic</span>
				<span class='text'>rior to Armstrong, most collective ensemble playing in jazz, along with its occasional solos, simply varied the melodies of the songs</span>
				<span class='text'>Armstrong was virtually the first to create significant variations based on the chord harmonies of the songs instead of merely on the melodies</span>
				<span class='text'>This opened a rich field for creation and improvisation, and significantly changed the music into a soloist's art form</span>
				<span class='text'>Often, Armstrong re-composed pop-tunes he played, simply with variations that made them more compelling to jazz listeners of the era</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time, however, his oeuvre includes many original melodies, creative leaps, and relaxed or driving rhythms</span>
				<span class='text'>Armstrong's playing technique, honed by constant practice, extended the range, tone and capabilities of the trumpet</span>
				<span class='text'>In his records, Armstrong almost single-handedly created the role of the jazz soloist, taking what had been essentially a collective folk music and turning it into an art form with tremendous possibilities for individual expression</span>
				<span class='text'>rmstrong was one of the first artists to use recordings of his performances to improve himself</span>
				<span class='text'>Armstrong was an avid audiophile</span>
				<span class='text'>He had a large collection of recordings, including reel-to-reel tapes, which he took on the road with him in a trunk during his later career</span>
				<span class='text'>He enjoyed listening to his own recordings, and comparing his performances musically</span>
				<span class='text'>In the den of his home, he had the latest audio equipment and would sometimes rehearse and record along with his older recordings or the radio</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Michael Cogswell, ''Louis Armstrong: The Offstage Story of Satchmo'' (Collector's Press, [[Portland, Oregon]], 2003) ISBN 1-888054-81-6 pp</span>
				<span class='text'>66–68</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;=== Vocal popularity ===As his music progressed and popularity grew, his singing also became very important</span>
				<span class='text'>Armstrong was not the first to record [[scat singing]], but he was masterful at it and helped popularize it with the first recording on which he scatted, &quot;[[Heebie Jeebies (composition)|Heebie Jeebies]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>At a recording session for [[Okeh Records]], when the sheet music supposedly fell on the floor and the music began before he could pick up the pages, Armstrong simply started singing nonsense syllables while Okeh president E</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Fearn, who was at the session, kept telling him to continue</span>
				<span class='text'>Armstrong did, thinking the track would be discarded, but that was the version that was pressed to disc, sold, and became an unexpected hit</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the story was thought to be apocryphal, Armstrong himself confirmed it in at least one interview as well as in his memoirs</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>tml |title=NPR's Jazz Profiles from NPR: Louis Armstrong: The Singer |publisher=National Public Radio |date= |accessdate=August 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a later recording, Armstrong also sang out &quot;I done forgot the words&quot; in the middle of recording &quot;I'm A Ding Dong Daddy From Dumas</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;Such records were hits and scat singing became a major part of his performances</span>
				<span class='text'>Long before this, however, Armstrong was playing around with his vocals, shortening and lengthening phrases, interjecting improvisations, using his voice as creatively as his trumpet</span>
				<span class='text'>==Composing===Armstrong was a gifted composer wrote more than fifty songs, which in a number of cases have become [[jazz standard]]s (e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> “Gully Low Blues,” “Potato Head Blues,” and “Swing That Music”)</span>
				<span class='text'>=== Colleagues and followers ===During his long career he played and sang with some of the most important instrumentalists and vocalists of the time; among them were [[Bing Crosby]], [[Duke Ellington]], [[Fletcher Henderson]], [[Earl Hines]], [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]], [[Bessie Smith]] and perhaps most famously [[Ella Fitzgerald]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His influence upon Crosby is particularly important with regard to the subsequent development of popular music: Crosby admired and copied Armstrong, as is evident on many of his early recordings, notably &quot;Just One More Chance&quot; (1931)</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''New Grove Dictionary of Jazz'' describes Crosby's debt to Armstrong in precise detail, although it does not acknowledge Armstrong by name:{{quote|Crosby</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>was important in introducing into the mainstream of popular singing an Afro-American concept of song as a lyrical extension of speech</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>His techniques—easing the weight of the breath on the vocal cords, passing into a [[head voice]] at a low register, using forward production to aid distinct [[enunciation]], singing on consonants (a practice of black singers), and making discreet use of [[appoggiatura]]s, [[mordent]]s, and [[slur (music)|slur]]s to emphasize the text—were emulated by nearly all later popular singers</span>
				<span class='text'>}Armstrong recorded two albums with Ella Fitzgerald: ''[[Ella and Louis]]'', and ''[[Ella and Louis Again]]'' for [[Verve Records]], with the sessions featuring the backing musicianship of the [[Oscar Peterson]] Trio and drummers [[Buddy Rich]] (on the first album), and [[Louie Bellson]] (on the second)</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Norman Granz]] then had the vision for Ella and Louis to record ''[[Porgy and Bess (Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong album)|Porgy and Bess]]'' which is the most famous and critically acclaimed version of the Gerswhin brothers' masterpiece</span>
				<span class='text'>is recordings for [[Columbia Records]], ''[[Louis Armstrong Plays W</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Handy]]'' (1954) and ''Satch Plays Fats'' (all [[Fats Waller]] tunes) (1955) were both being considered masterpieces, as well as moderately well selling</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1961 the All Stars participated in two albums - &quot;The Great Summit&quot; and &quot;The Great Reunion&quot; (now together as a single disc) with [[Duke Ellington]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The albums feature many of Ellington's most famous compositions (as well as two exclusive cuts) with Duke sitting in on piano</span>
				<span class='text'>His participation in [[Dave Brubeck]]'s high-concept jazz musical ''[[The Real Ambassadors]]'' (1963) was critically acclaimed, and features &quot;Summer Song,&quot; one of Armstrong's most popular vocal efforts</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Louis Armstrong and [[Grace Kelly]] on the set of ''High Society'', 1956]]The influence of Armstrong on the development of jazz is virtually immeasurable</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet, his irrepressible personality both as a performer, and as a public figure later in his career, was so strong that to some it sometimes overshadowed his contributions as a musician and singer</span>
				<span class='text'>s a virtuoso trumpet player, Armstrong had a unique tone and an extraordinary talent for melodic [[improvisation]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Through his playing, the trumpet emerged as a solo instrument in jazz and is used widely today</span>
				<span class='text'>Additionally, jazz itself was transformed from a collectively improvised folk music to a soloist's serious art form largely through his influence</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a masterful accompanist and ensemble player in addition to his extraordinary skills as a soloist</span>
				<span class='text'>With his innovations, he raised the bar musically for all who came after him</span>
				<span class='text'>hough Armstrong is widely recognized as a pioneer of [[scat singing]], [[Ethel Waters]] precedes his scatting on record in the 1930s according to [[Gary Giddins]] and others</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See ''Ken Burns' Jazz'' CD Set liner notes</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Billie Holiday and Frank Sinatra are just two singers who were greatly indebted to him</span>
				<span class='text'>Holiday said that she always wanted [[Bessie Smith]]'s 'big' sound and Armstrong's feeling in her singing</span>
				<span class='text'>Even special musicians like Duke Ellington have praised Armstrong through strong testimonials</span>
				<span class='text'>Duke Ellington said, &quot;If anybody was a master, it was Louis Armstrong</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; In 1950, [[Bing Crosby]], the most successful vocalist of the first half of the 20th century, said, &quot;He is the beginning and the end of music in America</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;In the summer of 2001, in commemoration of the centennial of Armstrong's birth, New Orleans's main airport was renamed [[Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 2002, the [[Louis Armstrong and his Hot Five|Louis Armstrong's Hot Five and Hot Seven]] recordings (1925–1928) were preserved in the United States National Recording Registry, a registry of [[recording]]s selected yearly by the [[National Recording Preservation Board]] for preservation in the [[National Recording Registry]] of the [[Library of Congress]]</span>
