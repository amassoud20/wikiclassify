				<span class='text'>At the outset of their experiments they regarded control as the unsolved third part of &quot;the flying problem&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>They believed sufficiently promising knowledge of the other two issues—wings and engines—already existed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Crouch 2003, p</span>
				<span class='text'>166</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The Wright brothers thus differed sharply from more experienced practitioners of the day, notably [[Clément Ader]], [[Hiram Maxim|Maxim]] and Langley who built powerful engines, attached them to airframes equipped with unproven control devices, and expected to take to the air with no previous flying experience</span>
				<span class='text'>Although agreeing with Lilienthal's idea of practice, the Wrights saw that his method of balance and control by shifting his body weight was inadequate</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tobin 2004, p</span>
				<span class='text'>53</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; They were determined to find something better</span>
				<span class='text'>n the basis of observation, Wilbur concluded that birds changed the angle of the ends of their wings to make their bodies roll right or left</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tobin 2004, p</span>
				<span class='text'>70</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The brothers decided this would also be a good way for a flying machine to turn—to &quot;bank&quot; or &quot;lean&quot; into the turn just like a bird—and just like a person riding a bicycle, an experience with which they were thoroughly familiar</span>
				<span class='text'>Equally important, they hoped this method would enable recovery when the wind tilted the machine to one side (lateral balance)</span>
				<span class='text'>They puzzled over how to achieve the same effect with man-made wings and eventually discovered [[wing-warping]] when Wilbur idly twisted a long inner-tube box at the bicycle shop</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tobin 2004, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>53–55</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Other aeronautical investigators regarded flight as if it were not so different from surface locomotion, except the surface would be elevated</span>
				<span class='text'>They thought in terms of a ship's rudder for steering, while the flying machine remained essentially level in the air, as did a train or an automobile or a ship at the surface</span>
				<span class='text'>The idea of deliberately leaning, or rolling, to one side seemed either undesirable or did not enter their thinking</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Crouch 2003, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>167–168</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Some of these other investigators, including Langley and Chanute, sought the elusive ideal of &quot;inherent stability&quot;, believing the pilot of a flying machine would not be able to react quickly enough to wind disturbances to use mechanical controls effectively</span>
				<span class='text'>The Wright brothers, on the other hand, wanted the pilot to have absolute control</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Crouch 2003, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>168–169</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; For that reason, their early designs made no concessions toward built-in stability (such as [[Dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral]] wings)</span>
				<span class='text'>They deliberately designed their 1903 first powered flyer with [[Dihedral (aircraft)#Anhedral|anhedral]] (drooping) wings, which are inherently unstable, but less susceptible to upset by gusty cross winds</span>

				<span class='text'>When the wings were warped, or twisted, one end of the wings produced more lift and the other end less lift</span>

				<span class='text'>The warping was controlled by four cords attached to the kite, which led to two sticks held by the kite flyer, who tilted them in opposite directions to twist the wings</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;]]Lilienthal had made &quot;whirling arm&quot; tests on only a few wing shapes, and the Wrights mistakenly assumed the data would apply to their wings, which had a different shape</span>
				<span class='text'>The Wrights took a huge step forward and made basic wind tunnel tests on 200 wings of many shapes and [[airfoil]] curves, followed by detailed tests on 38 of them</span>
				<span class='text'>The tests, according to biographer Fred Howard, &quot;were the most crucial and fruitful aeronautical experiments ever conducted in so short a time with so few materials and at so little expense&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Howard 1988, p</span>
				<span class='text'>72</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; An important discovery was the benefit of longer narrower wings: in aeronautical terms, wings with a larger [[aspect ratio]] (wingspan divided by [[Chord (aircraft)|chord]]—the wing's front-to-back dimension)</span>
				<span class='text'>Such shapes offered much better [[lift-to-drag ratio]] than the broader wings the brothers had tried so far</span>
				<span class='text'>ith this knowledge, and a more accurate Smeaton number, the Wrights designed their 1902 glider</span>
				<span class='text'>Using another crucial discovery from the wind tunnel, they made the airfoil flatter, reducing the camber (the depth of the wing's curvature divided by its chord)</span>
				<span class='text'>The 1901 wings had significantly greater curvature, a highly inefficient feature the Wrights copied directly from Lilienthal</span>
				<span class='text'>Fully confident in their new wind tunnel results, the Wrights discarded Lilienthal's data, now basing their designs on their own calculations</span>
				<span class='text'>ith characteristic caution, the brothers first flew the 1902 glider as an unmanned kite, as they had done with their two previous versions</span>
				<span class='text'>Rewarding their wind tunnel work, the glider produced the expected lift</span>
				<span class='text'>It also had a new structural feature: a fixed, rear vertical rudder, which the brothers hoped would eliminate turning problems</span>
				<span class='text'>y 1902 they realized that wing-warping created &quot;differential drag&quot; at the wingtips</span>
				<span class='text'>Greater lift at one end of the wing also increased drag, which slowed that end of the wing, making the glider swivel—or &quot;yaw&quot;—so the nose pointed away from the turn</span>
				<span class='text'>That was how the tailless 1901 glider behaved</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:1902 WrightBrosGlider</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|left|thumb|upright|Wilbur Wright pilots the [[1902 Wright Glider|1902 glider]] over the Kill Devil Hills, October 10, 1902</span>
				<span class='text'>The single rear rudder is steerable; it replaced the original fixed double rudder</span>
				<span class='text'>]The improved wing design enabled consistently longer glides, and the rear rudder prevented adverse yaw—so effectively that it introduced a new problem</span>
				<span class='text'>Sometimes when the pilot attempted to level off from a turn, the glider failed to respond to corrective wing-warping and persisted into a tighter turn</span>
				<span class='text'>The glider would slide toward the lower wing, which hit the ground, spinning the aircraft around</span>
				<span class='text'>The Wrights called this &quot;well digging&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>rville apparently visualized that the fixed rudder resisted the effect of corrective wing-warping when attempting to level off from a turn</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote in his diary that on the night of October 2, &quot;I studied out a new vertical rudder&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The brothers then decided to make the rear rudder movable to solve the problem</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Anderson 2004, p</span>
				<span class='text'>134</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; They hinged the rudder and connected it to the pilot's warping &quot;cradle&quot;, so a single movement by the pilot simultaneously controlled wing-warping and rudder deflection</span>
				<span class='text'>Tests while gliding proved that the trailing edge of the rudder should be turned away from whichever end of the wings had more drag (and lift) due to warping</span>
				<span class='text'>The opposing pressure produced by turning the rudder enabled corrective wing-warping to reliably restore level flight after a turn or a wind disturbance</span>
				<span class='text'>Furthermore, when the glider banked into a turn, rudder pressure overcame the effect of differential drag and pointed the nose of the aircraft in the direction of the turn, eliminating adverse yaw</span>
				<span class='text'>n short, the Wrights discovered the true purpose of the movable vertical rudder</span>
				<span class='text'>Its role was not to change the direction of flight (as a rudder does in sailing), but rather, to aim or align the aircraft correctly during banking turns and when leveling off from turns and wind disturbances</span>

				<span class='text'>]In 1904 the Wrights built the ''Flyer II''</span>
				<span class='text'>They decided to avoid the expense of travel and bringing supplies to the Outer Banks and set up an airfield at [[Huffman Prairie]], a cow pasture eight miles (13&amp;nbsp;km) northeast of Dayton</span>
				<span class='text'>They received permission to use the field rent-free from owner and bank president Torrance Huffman</span>
				<span class='text'>They invited reporters to their first flight attempt of the year on May 23, on the condition that no photographs be taken</span>
				<span class='text'>Engine troubles and slack winds prevented any flying, and they could manage only a very short hop a few days later with fewer reporters present</span>
				<span class='text'>Library of Congress historian Fred Howard noted some speculation that the brothers may have intentionally failed to fly in order to cause reporters to lose interest in their experiments</span>
				<span class='text'>Whether that is true is not known, but after their poor showing local newspapers virtually ignored them for the next year and a half</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Howard 1998, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>154–155</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The Wrights were glad to be free from the distraction of reporters</span>
				<span class='text'>The absence of newsmen also reduced the chance of competitors learning their methods</span>
				<span class='text'>After the Kitty Hawk powered flights, the Wrights made a decision to begin withdrawing from the bicycle business so they could concentrate on creating and marketing a practical airplane</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Crouch 2003, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>273–274</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This was financially risky, since they were neither wealthy nor government-funded (unlike other experimenters such as Ader, [[Hiram Stevens Maxim|Maxim]], Langley and [[Alberto Santos-Dumont]])</span>
				<span class='text'>The Wright brothers did not have the luxury of being able to give away their invention; it was to be their livelihood</span>

				<span class='text'>he Wrights scrapped the battered and much-repaired aircraft, but saved the engine, and in 1905 built a new airplane, the ''Flyer III''</span>

				<span class='text'>They also installed a separate control for the rear rudder instead of linking it to the wing-warping &quot;cradle&quot; as before</span>
				<span class='text'>Each of the three axes—pitch, roll and yaw—now had its own independent control</span>

				<span class='text'>Patent and Trademark Office]] archive&lt;/center&gt;]] The patent illustrates a non-powered flying machine—namely, the 1902 glider</span>
				<span class='text'>The patent's importance lies in its claim of a new and useful method of ''controlling'' a flying machine, powered or not</span>
				<span class='text'>The technique of wing-warping is described, but the patent explicitly states that other methods instead of wing-warping could be used for adjusting the outer portions of a machine's wings to different angles on the right and left sides to achieve lateral (roll) control</span>
				<span class='text'>The concept of varying the angle presented to the air near the wingtips, by any suitable method, is central to the patent</span>
				<span class='text'>The patent also describes the steerable rear vertical rudder and its innovative use in combination with wing-warping, enabling the airplane to make a ''coordinated turn'', a technique that prevents hazardous ''[[adverse yaw]]'', the problem Wilbur had when trying to turn the 1901 glider</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally, the patent describes the forward elevator, used for ascending and descending</span>
				<span class='text'>==Lawsuits begin===Attempting to circumvent the patent, Glenn Curtiss and other early aviators devised [[aileron]]s to emulate lateral control described in the patent and demonstrated by the Wrights in their public flights</span>

				<span class='text'>The Curtiss company appealed the decision</span>
				<span class='text'>rom 1910 until his death from [[typhoid fever]] in 1912, Wilbur took the leading role in the patent struggle, traveling incessantly to consult with lawyers and testify in what he felt was a moral cause, particularly against Curtiss, who was creating a large company to manufacture aircraft</span>
				<span class='text'>The Wrights' preoccupation with the legal issue stifled their work on new designs, and by 1911 Wright airplanes were considered inferior to those of European makers</span>
				<span class='text'>Indeed, aviation development in the U</span>

				<span class='text'>was suppressed to such an extent that when the U</span>
