				<span class='text'>Tito's leading role in liberating Yugoslavia not only greatly strengthened his position in his party and among the Yugoslav people, but also caused him to be more insistent that Yugoslavia had more room to follow its own interests than other Bloc leaders who had more reasons (and pressures) to recognize Soviet efforts in helping them liberate their own countries from Axis control</span>

				<span class='text'>ov]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the NSA failed to recognize that Tito was a native speaker of the very distinctive [[Kajkavian]] dialect of Zagorje, whose speakers have difficulty speaking the standard Serbo-Croatian language (based on [[Shtokavian dialect]]), both in respect of phonology and morphology</span>
				<span class='text'>The phonological values and common morphological mistakes made by Tito are based in the distinctive features of [[Kajkavian]] dialect as it is spoken in his homeland [[Zagorje]]</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Dedijer, Tito Speaks, 1953, p</span>
				<span class='text'>80</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Broz himself explains:&lt;blockquote&gt;It was a rule in the Party in those times not to use one's real name, in order to reduce the chances of exposure</span>
				<span class='text'>For instance, if someone working with me was arrested, and flogged into revealing my real name, the police would easily trace me</span>
				<span class='text'>But the police never knew the real person hiding behind an assumed name, such as I had in the Party</span>
				<span class='text'>Naturally, even the assumed names often had to be changed</span>
				<span class='text'>Even before going to prison I had taken the name of Gligorijević, and of Zagorac, meaning the 'man from Zagorje'</span>
				<span class='text'>I even signed a few newspaper articles with the second</span>
				<span class='text'>ow I had to take a new name</span>
				<span class='text'>I adopted first the name of Rudi, but another comrade had the same name and so I was obliged to change it, adopting the name Tito</span>
				<span class='text'>I hardly ever used Tito at first; I assumed it exclusively in 1938, when I began to sign articles with it</span>
				<span class='text'>Why did I take this name 'Tito' and has it special significance? I took it as I would have any other, because it occurred to me at the moment</span>
				<span class='text'>Apart from that, this name is quite frequent in my native district</span>
				<span class='text'>The best-known Zagorje writer of the late eighteenth century was called [[Tituš Brezovački|Tito Brezovački]]; his witty comedies are still given in the Croatian theatre after more than a hundred years</span>
				<span class='text'>The father of [[Ksaver Šandor Gjalski]], one of the greatest Croatian writers, was also called Tito</span>

				<span class='text'>21 decorations were from [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] itself, 18 having been awarded once, and the [[Order of the National Hero]] on three occasions</span>
				<span class='text'>Of the 98 international awards and decorations, 92 were received once, and three on two occasions ([[Order of the White Lion]], [[Order of Polonia Restituta|Polonia Restituta]], and [[Order of Karl Marx|Karl Marx]])</span>
				<span class='text'>The most notable awards included the French [[Legion of Honour]] and [[National Order of Merit (France)|National Order of Merit]], the British [[Order of the Bath]], the Soviet [[Order of Lenin]], the Japanese [[Order of the Chrysanthemum]], the German [[Federal Cross of Merit]], and the [[Order of Merit of the Italian Republic|Order of Merit of Italy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>he decorations were seldom displayed, however</span>
				<span class='text'>After the [[Tito–Stalin split]] of 1948 and his inauguration as president in 1953, Tito rarely wore his uniform except when present in a military function, and then (with rare exception) only wore his Yugoslav ribbons for obvious practical reasons</span>
				<span class='text'>The awards were displayed in full number only at his funeral in 1980</span>
