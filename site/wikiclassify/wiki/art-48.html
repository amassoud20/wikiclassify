				<span class='text'>Although Rodin is generally considered the progenitor of modern sculpture,&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, 16</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; he did not set out to rebel against the past</span>
				<span class='text'>He was schooled traditionally, took a craftsman-like approach to his work, and desired academic recognition,&lt;ref name=&quot;H76&quot;&gt;Hale, 76</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; although he was never accepted into Paris's foremost school of art</span>
				<span class='text'>culpturally, Rodin possessed a unique ability to model a complex, turbulent, deeply pocketed surface in [[clay]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of his most notable sculptures were roundly criticized during his lifetime</span>
				<span class='text'>They clashed with predominant figurative sculpture traditions, in which works were decorative, formulaic, or highly thematic</span>
				<span class='text'>Rodin's most original work departed from traditional themes of [[mythology]] and [[allegory]], modeled the human body with realism, and celebrated individual character and physicality</span>
				<span class='text'>Rodin was sensitive to the controversy surrounding his work, but refused to change his style</span>
				<span class='text'>Successive works brought increasing favor from the government and the artistic community</span>
				<span class='text'>rom the unexpected realism of his first major figure – inspired by his 1875 trip to Italy – to the unconventional memorials whose commissions he later sought, Rodin's reputation grew, such that he became the preeminent French sculptor of his time</span>
				<span class='text'>By 1900, he was a world-renowned artist</span>
				<span class='text'>Wealthy private clients sought Rodin's work after his [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|World's Fair]] exhibit, and he kept company with a variety of high-profile intellectuals and artists</span>
				<span class='text'>He married his lifelong companion, Rose Beuret, in the last year of both their lives</span>
				<span class='text'>His sculptures suffered a decline in popularity after his death in 1917, but within a few decades, his legacy solidified</span>
				<span class='text'>Rodin remains one of the few sculptors widely known outside the visual arts community</span>
				<span class='text'>=Biography=====Formative years===Rodin was born in 1840 into a working-class family in Paris, the second child of Marie Cheffer and Jean-Baptiste Rodin, who was a police department clerk</span>

				<span class='text'>Between ages 14 and 17, Rodin attended the ''Petite École'', a school specializing in art and mathematics, where he studied drawing and painting&lt;!--with Belloc--&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'>His drawing teacher, [[Horace Lecoq de Boisbaudran]], believed in first developing the personality of his students so that they observed with their own eyes and drew from their recollections</span>
				<span class='text'>Rodin still expressed appreciation for his teacher much later in life</span>

				<span class='text'>]In 1857, Rodin submitted a clay model of a companion to the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] in an attempt to win entrance; he did not succeed, and two further applications were also denied</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;nytobit&quot;/&gt; Given that entrance requirements at the ''Grande École'' were not particularly high,&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 40</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; the rejections were considerable setbacks</span>
				<span class='text'>Rodin's inability to gain entrance may have been due to the judges' [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] tastes, while Rodin had been schooled in light, 18th-century sculpture</span>
				<span class='text'>Leaving the ''Petite École'' in 1857, Rodin earned a living as a craftsman and ornamenter for most of the next two decades, producing decorative objects and architectural embellishments</span>
				<span class='text'>odin's sister Maria, two years his senior, died of [[peritonitis]] in a convent in 1862</span>
				<span class='text'>Her brother was anguished, and felt guilty because he had introduced Maria to an unfaithful suitor</span>
				<span class='text'>Turning away from art, Rodin briefly joined a Catholic order, the [[Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Saint [[Peter Julian Eymard]], founder and head of the congregation, recognized Rodin's talent and, sensing his lack of suitability for the order, encouraged Rodin to continue with his sculpture</span>
				<span class='text'>He returned to work as a decorator, while taking classes with animal sculptor [[Antoine-Louis Barye]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The teacher's attention to detail&amp;nbsp;– his finely rendered musculature of animals in motion&amp;nbsp;– significantly influenced Rodin</span>

				<span class='text'>307/3046338|jstor=3046338}}&lt;/ref&gt;In 1864, Rodin began to live with a young seamstress named Rose Beuret, with whom he would stay&amp;nbsp;– with ranging commitment&amp;nbsp;– for the rest of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>The couple had a son, Auguste-Eugène Beuret (1866–1934)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Date of death from Elsen, 206</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; That year, Rodin offered his first sculpture for exhibition, and entered the studio of [[Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse]], a successful mass producer of ''[[objets d'art]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Rodin worked as Carrier-Belleuse' chief assistant until 1870, designing roof decorations and staircase and doorway embellishments</span>
				<span class='text'>With the arrival of the [[Franco-Prussian War]], Rodin was called to serve in the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]], but his service was brief due to his [[near-sightedness]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jianou &amp; Goldscheider, 34</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Decorators' work had dwindled because of the war, yet Rodin needed to support his family; poverty was a continual difficulty for Rodin until about the age of 30</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;tabhhj&quot;&gt;Jianou &amp; Goldscheider, 35</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Carrier-Belleuse soon asked Rodin to join him in [[Belgium]], where they would work on ornamentation for [[Brussels Stock Exchange|Brussels' bourse]]</span>
				<span class='text'>odin planned to stay in Belgium a few months, but he spent the next six years out of France</span>
				<span class='text'>It was a pivotal time in his life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;tabhhj&quot;/&gt; He had acquired skill and experience as a craftsman, but no one had yet seen his art, which sat in his workshop, since he could not afford castings</span>
				<span class='text'>Though his relationship with Carrier-Belleuse deteriorated, Rodin found other employment in Brussels, displaying some works at salons, and his companion Rose soon joined him there</span>
				<span class='text'>Having saved enough money to travel, Rodin visited Italy for two months in 1875, where he was drawn to the work of [[Donatello]] and [[Michelangelo]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Their work had a profound effect on his artistic direction</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hale, 49–50</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Rodin said, &quot;It is [[Michelangelo]] who has freed me from academic sculpture</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Taillandier, 91</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Returning to Belgium, he began work on ''[[The Age of Bronze]]'', a life-size male figure whose realism brought Rodin attention but led to accusations of sculptural cheating</span>
				<span class='text'>==Artistic independence===Rose Beuret and Rodin returned to Paris in 1877, moving into a small flat on the [[Rive Gauche|Left Bank]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Misfortune surrounded Rodin: his mother, who had wanted to see her son marry, was dead, and his father was blind and senile, cared for by Rodin's sister-in-law, Aunt Thérèse</span>
				<span class='text'>Rodin's eleven-year-old son Auguste, possibly developmentally delayed, was also in the ever-helpful Thérèse's care</span>
				<span class='text'>Rodin had essentially abandoned his son for six years,&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 65</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and would have a very limited relationship with him throughout his life</span>
				<span class='text'>Father and son now joined the couple in their flat, with Rose as caretaker</span>
				<span class='text'>The charges of fakery surrounding ''The Age of Bronze'' continued</span>
				<span class='text'>Rodin increasingly sought more soothing female companionship in Paris, and Rose stayed in the background</span>
				<span class='text'>odin earned his living collaborating with more established sculptors on public commissions, primarily memorials and [[neo-baroque]] architectural pieces in the style of [[Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux|Carpeaux]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;j638&quot;&gt;Janson, 638</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In competitions for commissions he submitted models of [[Denis Diderot]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], and [[Lazare Carnot]], all to no avail</span>
				<span class='text'>On his own time, he worked on studies leading to the creation of his next important work, ''St</span>

				<span class='text'>]In 1880, Carrier-Belleuse&amp;nbsp;– now art director of the [[Sèvres]] national [[porcelain]] factory&amp;nbsp;– offered Rodin a part-time position as a designer</span>
				<span class='text'>The offer was in part a gesture of reconciliation, and Rodin accepted</span>
				<span class='text'>That part of Rodin which appreciated 18th-century tastes was aroused, and he immersed himself in designs for vases and table ornaments that brought the factory renown across Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hale, 70</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;[[File:The Thinker, Rodin</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|160px|Rodin's ''[[The Thinker]]'' (1879–1889) is among the most recognized works in all of sculpture</span>
				<span class='text'>]The artistic community appreciated his work in this vein, and Rodin was invited to [[Paris Salon]]s by such friends as writer [[Léon Cladel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>During his early appearances at these social events, Rodin seemed shy;&lt;ref name=&quot;H71&quot;&gt;Hale, 71</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; in his later years, as his fame grew, he displayed the loquaciousness and temperament for which he is better known</span>
				<span class='text'>French statesman [[Leon Gambetta]] expressed a desire to meet Rodin, and the sculptor impressed him when they met at a salon</span>
				<span class='text'>Gambetta spoke of Rodin in turn to several government ministers, likely including [[:fr:Edmond Turquet|Edmund Turquet]], the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Fine Arts, whom Rodin eventually met</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;H71&quot;/&gt;Rodin's relationship with Turquet was rewarding: through him, he won the 1880 commission to create a [[Portal (architecture)|portal]] for a planned museum of decorative arts</span>
				<span class='text'>Rodin dedicated much of the next four decades to his elaborate ''[[Gates of Hell]]'', an unfinished portal for a museum that was never built</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of the portal's figures became sculptures in themselves, including Rodin's most famous, ''[[The Thinker]]'' and ''[[The Kiss (Rodin sculpture)|The Kiss]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>With the museum commission came a free studio, granting Rodin a new level of artistic freedom</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon, he stopped working at the porcelain factory; his income came from private commissions</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1883, Rodin agreed to supervise a course for sculptor [[Alfred Boucher]] in his absence, where he met the 18-year-old [[Camille Claudel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The two formed a passionate but stormy relationship and influenced each other artistically</span>
				<span class='text'>Claudel inspired Rodin as a model for many of his figures, and she was a talented sculptor, assisting him on commissions</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough busy with ''The Gates of Hell'', Rodin won other commissions</span>
				<span class='text'>He pursued an opportunity to create a historical monument for the town of [[Calais]]</span>
				<span class='text'>For a monument to French author [[Honoré de Balzac]], Rodin was chosen in 1891</span>
				<span class='text'>His execution of both sculptures clashed with traditional tastes, and met with varying degrees of disapproval from the organizations that sponsored the commissions</span>
				<span class='text'>Still, Rodin was gaining support from diverse sources that propelled him toward fame</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1889, the Paris Salon invited Rodin to be a judge on its artistic jury</span>
				<span class='text'>Though Rodin's career was on the rise, Claudel and Beuret were becoming increasingly impatient with Rodin's &quot;double life&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Claudel and Rodin shared an [[wikt:atelier|atelier]] at a small old castle, but Rodin refused to relinquish his ties to Beuret, his loyal companion during the lean years, and mother of his son</span>
				<span class='text'>During one absence, Rodin wrote to Beuret, &quot;I think of how much you must have loved me to put up with my caprices</span>

				<span class='text'>1911]]In 1864, Rodin submitted his first sculpture for exhibition, ''The Man with the Broken Nose'', to the [[Paris Salon]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The subject was an elderly neighbourhood street porter</span>
				<span class='text'>The unconventional [[bronze]] piece was not a traditional [[bust (sculpture)|bust]], but instead the head was &quot;broken off&quot; at the neck, the nose was flattened and crooked, and the back of the head was absent, having fallen off the clay model in an accident</span>
				<span class='text'>The work emphasized texture and the emotional state of the subject; it illustrated the &quot;unfinishedness&quot; that would characterize many of Rodin's later sculptures</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Janson, 637</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The Salon rejected the piece</span>
				<span class='text'>==Early figures: the inspiration of Italy===In Brussels, Rodin created his first full-scale work, ''[[The Age of Bronze]]'', having returned from Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>Modeled by a Belgian soldier, the figure drew inspiration from Michelangelo's ''[[Dying Slave]]'', which Rodin had observed at the [[Louvre]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Attempting to combine Michelangelo's mastery of the human form with his own sense of human nature, Rodin studied his model from all angles, at rest and in motion; he mounted a ladder for additional perspective, and made clay models, which he studied by candlelight</span>
				<span class='text'>The result was a life-size, well-proportioned nude figure, posed unconventionally with his right hand atop his head, and his left arm held out at his side, forearm parallel to the body</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1877, the work debuted in Brussels and then was shown at the Paris Salon</span>
				<span class='text'>The statue's apparent lack of a theme was troubling to critics&amp;nbsp;– commemorating neither mythology nor a noble historical event&amp;nbsp;– and it is not clear whether Rodin intended a theme</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hale, 50</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He first titled the work ''The Vanquished'', in which form the left hand held a spear, but he removed the spear because it obstructed the torso from certain angles</span>
				<span class='text'>After two more intermediary titles, Rodin settled on ''The Age of Bronze'', suggesting the [[Bronze Age]], and in Rodin's words, &quot;man arising from nature&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;H51&quot;&gt;Hale, 51</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Later, however, Rodin said that he had had in mind &quot;just a simple piece of sculpture without reference to subject&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;H51&quot;/&gt;Its mastery of form, light, and shadow made the work look so realistic that Rodin was accused of ''surmoulage''&amp;nbsp;– having taken a cast from a living model</span>
				<span class='text'>Rodin vigorously denied the charges, writing to newspapers and having photographs taken of the model to prove how the sculpture differed</span>
				<span class='text'>He demanded an inquiry and was eventually exonerated by a committee of sculptors</span>
				<span class='text'>Leaving aside the false charges, the piece polarized critics</span>
				<span class='text'>It had barely won acceptance for display at the Paris Salon, and criticism likened it to &quot;a statue of a sleepwalker&quot; and called it &quot;an astonishingly accurate copy of a low type&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;H51&quot;/&gt; Others rallied to defend the piece and Rodin's integrity</span>
				<span class='text'>The government minister Turquet admired the piece, and ''The Age of Bronze'' was purchased by the state for 2,200 [[franc]]s&amp;nbsp;– what it had cost Rodin to have it cast in bronze</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;H51&quot;/&gt;[[File:St-John-the-Baptist-Preaching</span>

				<span class='text'>]A second male nude, ''[[Saint John the Baptist (Rodin)|St</span>
				<span class='text'>John the Baptist Preaching]]'', was completed in 1878</span>
				<span class='text'>Rodin sought to avoid another charge of ''surmoulage'' by making the statue larger than life: ''St</span>
				<span class='text'>John'' stands almost 6' 7&quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; (2&amp;nbsp;m)</span>
				<span class='text'>While ''The Age of Bronze'' is statically posed, ''St</span>
				<span class='text'>John'' gestures and seems to move toward the viewer</span>
				<span class='text'>The effect of walking is achieved despite the figure having both feet firmly on the ground&amp;nbsp;– a physical impossibility, and a technical achievement that was lost on most contemporary critics</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hale, 80</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Rodin chose this contradictory position to, in his words, &quot;display simultaneously</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>iews of an object which in fact can be seen only successively&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;H68&quot;&gt;Hale, 68</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Despite the title, ''St</span>
				<span class='text'>John the Baptist Preaching'' did not have an obviously religious theme</span>
				<span class='text'>The model, an Italian peasant who presented himself at Rodin's studio, possessed an idiosyncratic sense of movement that Rodin felt compelled to capture</span>
				<span class='text'>Rodin thought of [[John the Baptist]], and carried that association into the title of the work</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;H68&quot;/&gt; In 1880, Rodin submitted the sculpture to the Paris Salon</span>
				<span class='text'>Critics were still mostly dismissive of his work, but the piece finished third in the Salon's sculpture category</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;H68&quot;/&gt;Regardless of the immediate receptions of ''St</span>
				<span class='text'>John'' and ''The Age of Bronze'', Rodin had achieved a new degree of fame</span>

				<span class='text'>Commenting on Rodin's monument to Victor Hugo, ''[[The Times]]'' in 1909 expressed that &quot;there is some show of reason in the complaint that [Rodin's] conceptions are sometimes unsuited to his medium, and that in such cases they overstrain his vast technical powers&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Challenged in finding an appropriate representation of Balzac given the author's rotund physique, Rodin produced many studies: portraits, full-length figures in the nude, wearing a [[frock coat]], or in a [[robe]]&amp;nbsp;– a replica of which Rodin had requested</span>

				<span class='text'>Criticizing the work, Morey (1918) reflected, &quot;there may come a time, and doubtless will come a time, when it will not seem ''outre'' to represent a great novelist as a huge comic mask crowning a bathrobe, but even at the present day this statue impresses one as slang</span>

				<span class='text'>His sculpture emphasized the individual and the concreteness of flesh, and suggested emotion through detailed, textured surfaces, and the interplay of light and shadow</span>

				<span class='text'>His fragments&amp;nbsp;– perhaps lacking arms, legs, or a head&amp;nbsp;– took sculpture further from its traditional role of portraying likenesses, and into a realm where forms existed for their own sake</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hale, 69</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Notable examples are ''[[The Walking Man]]'', ''Meditation without Arms'', and ''Iris, Messenger of the Gods''</span>

				<span class='text'>&quot;Nothing, really, is more moving than the maddened beast, dying from unfulfilled desire and asking in vain for grace to quell its passion</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;alhadeff&quot;/&gt; [[Charles Baudelaire]] echoed those themes, and was among Rodin's favorite poets</span>
				<span class='text'>Rodin enjoyed music, especially the opera composer [[Gluck]], and wrote a book about [[List of cathedrals in France|French cathedrals]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He owned a work by the as-yet-unrecognized [[Vincent van Gogh|Van Gogh]], and admired the forgotten [[El Greco]]</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|A [[plaster]] of ''[[The Age of Bronze]]'']]Instead of copying traditional academic postures, Rodin preferred his models to move naturally around his studio (despite their nakedness)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;morey&quot;/&gt; The sculptor often made quick sketches in clay that were later fine-tuned, cast in plaster, and forged into bronze or carved in marble</span>
				<span class='text'>Rodin's focus was on the handling of clay</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Quoted in Jianou &amp; Goldscheider, 62</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;George Bernard Shaw sat for a portrait and gave an idea of Rodin's technique: &quot;While he worked, he achieved a number of miracles</span>
				<span class='text'>At the end of the first fifteen minutes, after having given a simple idea of the human form to the block of clay, he produced by the action of his thumb a bust so living that I would have taken it away with me to relieve the sculptor of any further work</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;He described the evolution of his bust over a month, passing through &quot;all the stages of art's evolution&quot;: first, a &quot;[[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] masterpiece&quot;, then &quot;[[Bernini]] intermingled&quot;, then an elegant [[Houdon]]</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;The hand of Rodin worked not as the hand of a sculptor works, but as the work of ''[[Elan Vital (term)|Elan Vital]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''Hand of God'' is his own hand</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;After he completed his work in clay, he employed highly skilled assistants to re-sculpt his compositions at larger sizes (including any of his large-scale monuments such as ''The Thinker''), to cast the clay compositions into plaster or bronze, and to carve his marbles</span>
				<span class='text'> Rodin's major innovation was to capitalize on such multi-staged processes of 19th century sculpture and their reliance on plaster casting</span>
				<span class='text'>ince clay deteriorates rapidly if not kept wet or fired into a terra-cotta, sculptors used plaster casts as a means of securing the composition they would make out of the fugitive material that is clay</span>
				<span class='text'> This was common practice amongst Rodin's contemporaries, and sculptors would exhibit plaster casts with the hopes that they would be commissioned to have the works made in a more permanent material</span>
				<span class='text'> Rodin, however, would have multiple plasters made and treat them as the raw material of sculpture, recombining their parts and figures into new compositions, and new names</span>
				<span class='text'>s Rodin's practice developed into the 1890s, he became more and more radical in his pursuit of fragmentation, the combination of figures at different scales, and the making of new compositions from his earlier work</span>
				<span class='text'> A prime example of this is the bold ''The Walking Man'' (1899–1900), which was exhibited as his major one-person show in 1900</span>
				<span class='text'> This is composed of two sculptures from the 1870s that Rodin found in his studio&amp;nbsp;– a broken and damaged torso that had fallen into neglect and the lower extremities of a statuette version of his 1878 ''St</span>
				<span class='text'>John the Baptist Preaching'' he was having re-sculpted at a reduced scale</span>
				<span class='text'>ithout finessing the join between upper and lower, between torso and legs, Rodin created a work that many sculptors at the time and subsequently have seen as one of his strongest and most singular works</span>
				<span class='text'> This is despite the fact that the object conveys two different styles, exhibits two different attitudes toward finish, and lacks any attempt to hide the arbitrary fusion of these two components</span>
				<span class='text'> It was the freedom and creativity with which Rodin used these practices&amp;nbsp;– along with his activation surfaces of sculptures through traces of his own touch and with his more open attitude toward bodily pose, sensual subject matter, and non-realistic surface&amp;nbsp;– that marked Rodin's re-making of traditional 19th century sculptural techniques into the prototype for modern sculpture</span>

				<span class='text'> Fortunately, he came to know [[Sarah Tyson Hallowell]] (1846–1924), a curator from Chicago who visited Paris to arrange exhibitions at the large Interstate Expositions of the 1870s and 1880s</span>
				<span class='text'>Hallowell was not only a curator but an adviser and a facilitator who was trusted by a number of prominent American collectors to suggest works for their collections, the most prominent of these being the Chicago hotelier [[Potter Palmer]] and his wife, [[Bertha Palmer]] (1849–1918)</span>
				<span class='text'>he next opportunity for Rodin in America was the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition|Chicago World's Fair]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;The Indefatigable Miss Hallowell, Page 6&lt;/ref&gt; Hallowell wanted to help promote Rodin's work and he suggested a solo exhibition, which she wrote him was ''beaucoup moins beau que l'original'' but impossible, outside the rules</span>
				<span class='text'> Instead, she suggested he send a number of works for her loan exhibition of French art from American collections and she told him she would list them as being part of an American collection</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Rodin: The Shape of Genius, Page 399&lt;/ref&gt; Rodin sent Hallowell three works, ''Cupid and Psyche'', ''Sphinx'' and ''Andromeda''</span>

				<span class='text'> However, the works he gave Hallowell to sell found no takers, but she soon brought the controversial Quaker-born financier [[Charles Yerkes]] (1837–1905) into the fold and he purchased two large marbles for his Chicago manse;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Documented Image, Page 97&quot;/&gt; Yerkes was likely the first American to own a Rodin sculpture</span>

				<span class='text'> In appreciation for her efforts at unlocking the American market, Rodin eventually presented Hallowell with a bronze, a marble and a terra cotta</span>
