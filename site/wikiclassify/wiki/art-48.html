				<span class='text'>The offer was in part a gesture of reconciliation and Rodin accepted</span>
				<span class='text'>That part of Rodin which appreciated 18th century tastes was aroused and he immersed himself in designs for vases and table ornaments that brought the factory renown across Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>ale 70</span>
				<span class='text'>The artistic community appreciated his work in this vein and Rodin was invited to s by such friends as writer </span>
				<span class='text'>During his early appearances at these social events Rodin seemed shy name H71Hale 71</span>
				<span class='text'> in his later years as his fame grew he displayed the loquaciousness and temperament for which he is better known</span>
				<span class='text'>French statesman  expressed a desire to meet Rodin and the sculptor impressed him when they met at a salon</span>

				<span class='text'>Rodin dedicated much of the next four decades to his elaborate  an unfinished portal for a museum that was never built</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of the portals figures became sculptures in themselves including Rodins most famous  and </span>
				<span class='text'>With the museum commission came a free studio granting Rodin a new level of artistic freedom</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon he stopped working at the porcelain factory his income came from private commissions</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1883 Rodin agreed to supervise a course for sculptor  in his absence where he met the 18 year old </span>
				<span class='text'>The two formed a passionate but stormy relationship and influenced each other artistically</span>
				<span class='text'>Claudel inspired Rodin as a model for many of his figures and she was a talented sculptor assisting him on commissions</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough busy with The Gates of Hell Rodin won other commissions</span>
				<span class='text'>He pursued an opportunity to create a historical monument for the town of </span>
				<span class='text'>For a monument to French author  Rodin was chosen in 1891</span>
				<span class='text'>His execution of both sculptures clashed with traditional tastes and met with varying degrees of disapproval from the organizations that sponsored the commissions</span>
				<span class='text'>Still Rodin was gaining support from diverse sources that propelled him toward fame</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1889 the Paris Salon invited Rodin to be a judge on its artistic jury</span>
				<span class='text'>Though Rodins career was on the rise Claudel and Beuret were becoming increasingly impatient with Rodins double life</span>
				<span class='text'>Claudel and Rodin shared an  at a small old castle but Rodin used to relinquish his ties to Beuret his loyal companion during the lean years and mother of his son</span>
				<span class='text'>During one absence Rodin wrote to Beuret I think of how much you must have loved me to put up with my caprices</span>

				<span class='text'>  Claudel and Rodin parted in 1898</span>
				<span class='text'> Claudel suffered a nervous breakdown several years later and was confined to an institution by her family until her death</span>
				<span class='text'>orksIn 1864 Rodin submitted his first sculpture for exhibition The Man with the Broken Nose to the </span>
				<span class='text'>The subject was an elderly neighbourhood street porter</span>
				<span class='text'>The unconventional  piece was not a traditional  but instead the head was broken off at the neck the nose was flattened and crooked and the back of the head was absent having fallen off the clay model in an accident</span>
				<span class='text'>The work emphasized texture and the emotional state of the subject it illustrated the unfinishedness that would characterize many of Rodins later sculptures</span>
				<span class='text'>anson 637</span>
				<span class='text'> The Salon rejected the piece</span>
				<span class='text'>n Brussels Rodin created his first full scale work  having returned from Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>Modeled by a Belgian soldier the figure drew inspiration from Michelangelos  which Rodin had observed at the </span>
				<span class='text'>Attempting to combine Michelangelos mastery of the human form with his own sense of human nature Rodin studied his model from all angles at rest and in motion he mounted a ladder for additional perspective and made clay models which he studied by candlelight</span>
				<span class='text'>The result was a life size well proportioned nude figure posed unconventionally with his right hand atop his head and his left arm held out at his side forearm parallel to the body</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1877 the work debuted in Brussels and then was shown at the Paris Salon</span>
				<span class='text'>The statues apparent lack of a theme was troubling to criticsampnbsp– commemorating neither mythology nor a noble historical eventampnbsp– and it is not clear whether Rodin intended a theme</span>
				<span class='text'>ale 50</span>
				<span class='text'> He first titled the work The Vanquished in which form the left hand held a spear but he removed the spear because it obstructed the torso from certain angles</span>

				<span class='text'> Later however Rodin said that he had had in mind just a simple piece of sculpture without erence to subject</span>
				<span class='text'>name H51 Its mastery of form light and shadow made the work look so realistic that Rodin was accused of surmoulageampnbsp– having taken a cast from a living model</span>
				<span class='text'>Rodin vigorously denied the charges writing to newspapers and having photographs taken of the model to prove how the sculpture differed</span>
				<span class='text'>He demanded an inquiry and was eventually exonerated by a committee of sculptors</span>
				<span class='text'>Leaving aside the false charges the piece polarized critics</span>
				<span class='text'>It had barely won acceptance for display at the Paris Salon and criticism likened it to a statue of a sleepwalker and called it an astonishingly accurate copy of a low type</span>
				<span class='text'>name H51  Others rallied to defend the piece and Rodins integrity</span>
				<span class='text'>The government minister Turquet admired the piece and The Age of Bronze was purchased by the state for 2200 sampnbsp– what it had cost Rodin to have it cast in bronze</span>
				<span class='text'>name H51 A second male nude  was completed in 1878</span>
				<span class='text'>Rodin sought to avoid another charge of surmoulage by making the statue larger than life St</span>

				<span class='text'>The model an Italian peasant who presented himself at Rodins studio possessed an idiosyncratic sense of movement that Rodin felt compelled to capture</span>

				<span class='text'>He pursued the commission interested in the medieval motif and patriotic theme</span>
				<span class='text'>The mayor of Calais was tempted to hire Rodin on the spot upon visiting his studio and soon the memorial was approved with Rodin as its architect</span>

				<span class='text'>One year into the commission the Calais committee was not impressed with Rodins progress</span>
				<span class='text'>Rodin indicated his willingness to end the project rather than change his design to meet the committees conservative expectations but Calais said to continue</span>

				<span class='text'> At ground level the figures positions lead the viewer around the work and subtly suggest their common movement forward</span>

				<span class='text'>George Bernard Shaw sat for a portrait and gave an idea of Rodins technique While he worked he achieved a number of miracles</span>
				<span class='text'>At the end of the first fifteen minutes after having given a simple idea of the human form to the block of clay he produced by the action of his thumb a bust so living that I would have taken it away with me to relieve the sculptor of any further work</span>
				<span class='text'>name ReferenceA He described the evolution of his bust over a month passing through all the stages of arts evolution first a  masterpiece then  intermingled then an elegant </span>
				<span class='text'>The hand of Rodin worked not as the hand of a sculptor works but as the work of </span>
				<span class='text'>The Hand of God is his own hand</span>
				<span class='text'>name ReferenceA After he completed his work in clay he employed highly skilled assistants to re sculpt his compositions at larger sizes including any of his large scale monuments such as The Thinker to cast the clay compositions into plaster or bronze and to carve his marbles</span>
				<span class='text'> Rodins major innovation was to capitalize on such multi staged processes of 19th century sculpture and their reliance on plaster casting</span>
				<span class='text'>ince clay deteriorates rapidly if not kept wet or fired into a terra cotta sculptors used plaster casts as a means of securing the composition they would make out of the fugitive material that is clay</span>
				<span class='text'> This was common practice amongst Rodins contemporaries and sculptors would exhibit plaster casts with the hopes that they would be commissioned to have the works made in a more permanent material</span>
				<span class='text'> Rodin however would have multiple plasters made and treat them as the raw material of sculpture recombining their parts and figures into new compositions and new names</span>
				<span class='text'>s Rodins practice developed into the 1890s he became more and more radical in his pursuit of fragmentation the combination of figures at different scales and the making of new compositions from his earlier work</span>
				<span class='text'> A prime example of this is the bold The Walking Man 1899–1900 which was exhibited as his major one person show in 1900</span>
				<span class='text'> This is composed of two sculptures from the 1870s that Rodin found in his studioampnbsp– a broken and damaged torso that had fallen into neglect and the lower extremities of a statuette version of his 1878 St</span>
				<span class='text'>John the Baptist Preaching he was having re sculpted at a reduced scale</span>
				<span class='text'>ithout finessing the join between upper and lower between torso and legs Rodin created a work that many sculptors at the time and subsequently have seen as one of his strongest and most singular works</span>
				<span class='text'> This is despite the fact that the object conveys two different styles exhibits two different attitudes toward finish and lacks any attempt to hide the arbitrary fusion of these two components</span>
				<span class='text'> It was the freedom and creativity with which Rodin used these practicesampnbsp– along with his activation surfaces of sculptures through traces of his own touch and with his more open attitude toward bodily pose sensual subject matter and non realistic surfaceampnbsp– that marked Rodins re making of traditional 19th century sculptural techniques into the prototype for modern sculpture</span>
				<span class='text'>ater years 1900–1917By 1900 Rodins artistic reputation was entrenched</span>
				<span class='text'>Gaining exposure from a pavilion of his artwork set up near the 1900  Exposition Universelle in Paris he received requests to make busts of prominent people internationally name bell  while his assistants at the atelier produced duplicates of his works</span>
				<span class='text'>His income from portrait commissions alone totalled probably 200000 francs a year</span>

				<span class='text'> As Rodins fame grew he attracted many followers including the German poet  and authors   and </span>
				<span class='text'>name apollo Rilke stayed with Rodin in 1905 and 1906 and did administrative work for him he would later write a laudatory  on the sculptor</span>

				<span class='text'>Rodin moved to the city in 1908 renting the main floor of the  an 18th century townhouse</span>
				<span class='text'>He left Beuret in Meudon and began an affair with the American born Duchesse de Choiseul</span>
				<span class='text'>name julius While Rodin was beginning to be accepted in France by the time of The Burghers of Calais he had not yet conquered the American market and because of his technique and the frankness of some of his work he did not have an easy time selling his work to American industrialists</span>
				<span class='text'> Fortunately he came to know  1846–1924 a curator from Chicago who visited Paris to arrange exhibitions at the large Interstate Expositions of the 1870s and 1880s</span>
				<span class='text'>Hallowell was not only a curator but an adviser and a facilitator who was trusted by a number of prominent American collectors to suggest works for their collections the most prominent of these being the Chicago hotelier  and his wife  1849–1918</span>

				<span class='text'>he Indefatigable Miss Hallowell Page 6  Hallowell wanted to help promote Rodins work and he suggested a solo exhibition which she wrote him was beaucoup moins beau que loriginal but impossible outside the rules</span>
				<span class='text'> Instead she suggested he send a number of works for her loan exhibition of French art from American collections and she told him she would list them as being part of an American collection</span>

				<span class='text'> In appreciation for her efforts at unlocking the American market Rodin eventually presented Hallowell with a bronze a marble and a terra cotta</span>
				<span class='text'>When Hallowell moved to Paris in 1893 she and Rodin continued their warm friendship and correspondence which lasted to the end of the sculptors life</span>
