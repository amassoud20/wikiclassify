				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Starting in the 160s, [[Germanic tribes]] and other nomadic people launched raids along the [[limes Germanicus|northern border]], particularly into [[Gaul]] and across the [[Danube#Human history|Danube]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This new impetus westwards was probably due to attacks from tribes further east</span>
				<span class='text'>A first invasion of the [[Chatti]] in the province of [[Germania Superior]] was repulsed in 162</span>
				<span class='text'>ar more dangerous was the invasion of 166, when the [[Marcomanni]] of Bohemia, clients of the Roman Empire since 19, crossed the Danube together with the [[Lombards]] and other Germanic tribes</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time, the Iranian [[Sarmatians]] attacked between the Danube and the [[Tisza|Theiss]] rivers</span>
				<span class='text'>ue to the situation in the East, only a [[punitive expedition]] could be launched in 167</span>
				<span class='text'>Both Marcus and Verus led the troops</span>
				<span class='text'>After the death of Verus (169), Marcus led personally the struggle against the Germanic tribes for the great part of his remaining life</span>
				<span class='text'>The Romans suffered at least two serious defeats by the [[Quadi]] and Marcomanni, who could cross the Alps, ravage ''Opitergium'' ([[Oderzo]]) and besiege [[Aquileia]], the main Roman city of north-east Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>t the same time the [[Costoboci]], coming from the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] area, invaded [[Moesia]], [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]] and Greece</span>
				<span class='text'>After a long struggle, Marcus Aurelius managed to push back the invaders</span>
				<span class='text'>Numerous members of Germanic tribes settled in frontier regions like [[Dacia]], [[Pannonia]], Germany and Italy itself</span>
				<span class='text'>This was not a new thing, but this time the numbers of settlers required the creation of two new frontier provinces on the left shore of the Danube, Sarmatia and [[Marcomannia]], including today's Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary</span>
				<span class='text'>Some Germanic tribes who settled in [[Ravenna]] revolted and managed to seize possession of the city</span>
				<span class='text'>For this reason, Marcus Aurelius decided not only against bringing more barbarians into Italy, but even banished those who had previously been brought there</span>

				<span class='text'>-5; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius''&lt;/ref&gt;The emperor's plans were, however, prevented by a revolt in East, led by Avidius Cassius, which was prompted by false news of the death of Marcus after an illness</span>
				<span class='text'>Of the eastern provinces, only [[Cappadocia]] and [[Bithynia]] did not side with the rebels</span>
				<span class='text'>When it became clear that Marcus Aurelius was still alive, Cassius' fortunes declined quickly and he was killed by his troops after only 100 days of power</span>
				<span class='text'>ogether with his wife Faustina, Marcus Aurelius toured the eastern provinces until 173</span>
				<span class='text'>He visited Athens, declaring himself a protector of philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>After a triumph in Rome, the following year he marched again to the Danubian frontier</span>
				<span class='text'>After a decisive victory in 178, the plan to annex [[Moravia]] and [[West Slovakia]]  seemed poised for success but was abandoned after Marcus Aurelius again fell ill in 180</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|Equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius, Rome]]Marcus Aurelius died on 17 March 180, in the city of Vindobona (modern [[Vienna]])</span>
				<span class='text'>He was immediately deified and his ashes were returned to [[Rome]], and rested in [[Hadrian]]'s [[mausoleum]] (modern [[Castel Sant'Angelo]]) until the [[Visigoth]] [[Sack of Rome (410)|sack of the city]] in 410</span>
				<span class='text'>His campaigns against Germans and Sarmatians were also commemorated by a [[Column of Marcus Aurelius|column]] and a [[temple of Marcus Aurelius|temple]] built in [[Rome]]</span>
				<span class='text'>arcus gave the succession to his son [[Commodus]], whom he had named Caesar in 166 and made co-emperor in 177</span>
				<span class='text'>This decision, putting an end to the series of &quot;adoptive emperors&quot;, was highly criticized by later historians since Commodus was a political and military outsider, as well as an extreme egotist with neurotic problems</span>
				<span class='text'>t the end of his history of Marcus' reign, Cassius Dio wrote an [[encomium]] to the emperor, and described the transition to Commodus, to Dio's own times, with sorrow</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;blockquote&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Marcus] did not meet with the good fortune that he deserved, for he was not strong in body and was involved in a multitude of troubles throughout practically his entire reign</span>
				<span class='text'>But for my part, I admire him all the more for this very reason, that amid unusual and extraordinary difficulties he both survived himself and preserved the empire</span>
				<span class='text'>Just one thing prevented him from being completely happy, namely, that after rearing and educating his son in the best possible way he was vastly disappointed in him</span>
				<span class='text'>This matter must be our next topic; for our history now descends from a kingdom of gold to one of iron and rust, as affairs did for the Romans of that day</span>
