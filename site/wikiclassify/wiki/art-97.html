				<span class='text'>  He retained poignant memories of childhood helped by an excellent memory of people and events which he used in his writing</span>

				<span class='text'> This period came to an end in June 1822 when John Dickens was recalled to Navy Pay Office headquarters at  and the family—minus Charles who stayed behind to finish his final term of work—moved to  in London</span>

				<span class='text'>To pay for his board and to help his family Dickens was forced to leave school and work ten hour days at Warrens  Warehouse on Hungerford Stairs near the present  where he earned six s a week pasting labels on pots of boot blacking</span>
				<span class='text'>The strenuous and often harsh working conditions made a lasting impression on Dickens and later influenced his fiction and essays becoming the foundation of his interest in the orm of socio economic and labour conditions the rigours of which he believed were unfairly borne by the poor</span>
				<span class='text'>He later wrote that he wondered how I could have been so easily cast away at such an age</span>
				<span class='text'>name Foster23  As he recalled to  from The Life of Charles DickensblockquoteThe blacking warehouse was the last house on the left hand side of the way at old Hungerford Stairs</span>
				<span class='text'>It was a crazy tumble down old house abutting of course on the river and literally overrun with rats</span>
				<span class='text'>Its wainscoted rooms and its rotten floors and staircase and the old grey rats swarming down in the cellars and the sound of their squeaking and scuffling coming up the stairs at all times and the dirt and decay of the place rise up visibly before me as if I were there again</span>
				<span class='text'>The counting house was on the first floor looking over the coal barges and the river</span>
				<span class='text'>There was a recess in it in which I was to sit and work</span>
				<span class='text'>My work was to cover the pots of paste blacking first with a piece of oil paper and then with a piece of blue paper to tie them round with a string and then to clip the paper close and neat all round until it looked as smart as a pot of ointment from an apothecarys shop</span>
				<span class='text'>When a certain number of grosses of pots had attained this pitch of perfection I was to paste on each a printed label and then go on again with more pots</span>
				<span class='text'>Two or three other boys were kept at similar duty down stairs on similar wages</span>
				<span class='text'>One of them came up in a ragged apron and a paper cap on the first Monday morning to show me the trick of using the string and tying the knot</span>
				<span class='text'>His name was Bob Fagin and I took the liberty of using his name long afterwards in Oliver Twist</span>

				<span class='text'>This influenced Dickenss view that a father should rule the family and a mother find her proper sphere inside the home I never afterwards forgot I never shall forget I never can forget that my mother was warm for my being sent back</span>
				<span class='text'>His mothers failure to request his return was a factor in his dissatisfied attitude towards women</span>

				<span class='text'> This education was to inform works such as  Dombey and Son and especially Bleak House—whose vivid portrayal of the machinations and bureaucracy of the legal system did much to enlighten the general public and served as a vehicle for dissemination of Dickenss own views regarding particularly the heavy burden on the poor who were forced by circumstances to go to law</span>

				<span class='text'> He persuaded a group of twenty five writers headed by  to sign a petition for him to take to Congress but the press were generally hostile to this saying that he should be grateful for his popularity and that it was mercenary to complain about his work being pirated</span>
				<span class='text'> The popularity he gained caused a shift in his self perception according to critic Kate Flint who writes the he found himself a cultural commodity and its circulation had passed out his control causing him to become interested in and delve into themes of public and personal personas in the next novels</span>

				<span class='text'>Of these A Christmas Carol was most popular and tapping into an old tradition did much to promote a renewed enthusiasm for the joys of Christmas in Britain and America</span>
				<span class='text'>  The seeds for the story became planted in Dickenss mind during a trip to Manchester to witness the conditions of the manufacturing workers there</span>
				<span class='text'>This along with scenes he had recently witnessed at the Field Lane  caused Dickens to resolve to strike a sledge hammer blow for the poor</span>
				<span class='text'>As the idea for the story took shape and the writing began in earnest Dickens became engrossed in the book</span>
				<span class='text'>He later wrote that as the tale unfolded he wept and laughed and wept again as he walked about the black streets of London fifteen or twenty miles many a night when all sober folks had gone to bed</span>
				<span class='text'> After living briefly in Italy 1844 Dickens travelled to Switzerland 1846 where he began work on Dombey and Son 1846–48</span>
				<span class='text'>This and David Copperfield 1849–50 mark a significant artistic break in Dickenss career as his novels became more serious in theme and more caully planned than his early works</span>
				<span class='text'>t about this time he was made aware of a large embezzlement at the firm where his brother Augustus worked John Chapman amp Co</span>
				<span class='text'>  It had been carried out by  a clerk who was on friendly terms with Dickens and who had acted as mentor to Augustus when he started work</span>
				<span class='text'> Powell was also an author and poet and knew many of the famous writers of the day</span>
				<span class='text'>After further fraudulent activities  Powell fled to New York and published a book called The Living Authors of England with a chapter on Charles Dickens who was not amused by what Powell had written</span>
				<span class='text'> One item that seemed to have annoyed him was the assertion that he had based the character of Paul Dombey  on Thomas Chapman one of the principal partners at John Chapman amp Co</span>
				<span class='text'> Dickens immediately fired off a letter to  editor of the New York literary magazine  saying that Powell was a forger and thief</span>
				<span class='text'> Clark published the letter in the  and several other papers picked up on the story</span>
				<span class='text'> Powell started proceedings to sue these publications and Clark was arrested</span>
				<span class='text'>Dickens realising that he had acted in haste contacted John Chapman amp Co</span>
				<span class='text'>to seek written confirmation of Powell’s guilt</span>
				<span class='text'> Dickens did receive a reply confirming Powells embezzlement but once the directors realised this information may have to be produced in court they used to make further disclosures</span>
				<span class='text'> Due to the difficulties of providing evidence in America to support his accusations Dickens eventually made a private settlement with Powell out of court</span>
				<span class='text'>PhilanthropyIn May 1846  heir to the Coutts banking fortune approached Dickens about setting up a home for the redemption of  of the working class</span>
				<span class='text'>Coutts envisioned a home that would replace the punitive regimes of existing institutions with a ormative environment conducive to education and proficiency in domestic household chores</span>
				<span class='text'>After initially resisting Dickens eventually founded the home named Urania Cottage in the Lime Grove section of  which he managed for ten years</span>

				<span class='text'>  It was here that he indulged in the amateur theatricals described in Forsters Life</span>

				<span class='text'>  Dickens whose philanthropy was well known was asked by his friend the hospitals founder  to preside over the appeal and he threw himself into the task heart and soul</span>
				<span class='text'>  Dickenss public readings secured sufficient funds for an endowment to put the hospital on a sound financial footing—one reading on 9 February 1858 alone raised £3000</span>

				<span class='text'>After separating from Catherine</span>
				<span class='text'> Dickens undertook a series of hugely popular and remunerative reading tours which together with his journalism were to absorb most of his creative energies for the next decade in which he was to write only two more novels</span>
				<span class='text'>  His first reading tour lasting from April 1858 to February 1859 consisted of 129 appearances in 49 different towns throughout England Scotland and Ireland</span>
				<span class='text'>  Dickenss continued fascination with the theatrical world was written into the theatre scenes in Nicholas Nickleby but more importantly he found an outlet in public readings</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1866 he undertook a series of public readings in England and Scotland with more the following year in England and Ireland</span>

				<span class='text'> the extent of the affair between the two remains speculative</span>
				<span class='text'>  In the 1930s Thomas Wright recounted that Ternan had unburdened herself with a Canon Benham and gave currency to rumours they had been lovers</span>

				<span class='text'>Second visit to the United StatesIn the late 1850s Dickens began to contemplate a second visit to the United States tempted by the money that he believed he could make by extending his reading tour there</span>
				<span class='text'>The outbreak of the Civil War in America in 1861 delayed his plans</span>
				<span class='text'>Over two years after the war Dickens set sail from  on 9 November 1867 for his second American reading tour</span>

				<span class='text'> After Dickens had regained sufficient strength he arranged with medical approval for a final series of readings to partially make up to his sponsors what they had lost due to his illness</span>

				<span class='text'>  His last words were On the ground in response to his sister in law Georginas request that he lie down</span>
				<span class='text'> On Sunday 19 June 1870 five days after Dickens was buried in the Abbey Dean  delivered a memorial elegy lauding the genial and loving humorist whom we now mourn for showing by his own example that even in dealing with the darkest scenes and the most degraded characters genius could still be clean and mirth could be innocent</span>
				<span class='text'>Pointing to the fresh flowers that adorned the novelists grave Stanley assured those present that the spot would thenceforth be a sacred one with both the New World and the Old as that of the representative of literature not of this island only but of all who speak our English tongue</span>
				<span class='text'> In his will drafted more than a year before his death Dickens left the care of his £80000 estate to his longtime colleague John Forster and his best and truest friend Georgina Hogarth who along with Dickenss two sons also received a tax free sum of £8000 about £800000 in present terms</span>

				<span class='text'>Literary styleDickens perred the style of the 18th century picaresque novels that he found in abundance on his fathers shelves</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Ackroyd other than these perhaps the most important literary influence on him was derived from the fables of The Arabian Nights</span>

				<span class='text'> Satire flourishing in his gift for caricature is his forte</span>
				<span class='text'>An early reviewer compared him to  for his keen practical sense of the ludicrous side of life though his acclaimed mastery of varieties of class idiom may in fact mirror the conventions of contemporary popular theatre</span>
				<span class='text'>  Dickens worked intensively on developing arresting names for his characters that would reverberate with associations for his readers and assist the development of motifs in the storyline giving what one critic calls an allegorical impetus to the novels meanings</span>
				<span class='text'>name Mee2010   To cite one of numerous examples the name Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Murdstone in David Copperfield conjures up twin allusions to murder and stony coldness</span>
				<span class='text'>  His literary style is also a mixture of  and </span>
				<span class='text'>His satires of British aristocratic snobbery—he calls one character the Noble Refrigerator—are often popular</span>
				<span class='text'>Comparing orphans to stocks and shares people to tug boats or dinner party guests to furniture are just some of Dickenss acclaimed flights of fancy</span>
				<span class='text'>he author worked closely with his illustrators supplying them with a summary of the work at the outset and thus ensuring that his characters and settings were exactly how he envisioned them</span>
				<span class='text'>He briefed the illustrator on plans for each months instalment so that work could begin before he wrote them</span>

				<span class='text'> Dickenss biographer  regards him as the greatest creator of character in English fiction after </span>
				<span class='text'> Dickensian  are amongst the most memorable in English literature especially so because of their typically whimsical names</span>
				<span class='text'>The likes of                   and  are so well known as to be part and parcel of British culture and in some cases have passed into ordinary language a scrooge for example is a miser</span>
				<span class='text'>is characters were often so memorable that they took on a life of their own outside his books</span>
				<span class='text'>Gamp became a slang expression for an umbrella from the character Mrs Gamp and Pickwickian Pecksniffian and Gradgrind all entered dictionaries due to Dickenss original portraits of such characters who were respectively  hypocritical and vapidly factual</span>
				<span class='text'>Many were drawn from real life Mrs Nickleby is based on his mother though she didnt recognise herself in the portrait</span>
				<span class='text'> just as Mr Micawber is constructed from aspects of his fathers rhetorical exuberance</span>
				<span class='text'> Harold Skimpole in Bleak House is based on  his wifes dwarfish chiropodist recognised herself in Miss Mowcher in David Copperfield</span>
				<span class='text'> </span>
				<span class='text'> Perhaps Dickenss impressions on his meeting with Hans Christian Andersen informed the delineation of Uriah Heep</span>
				<span class='text'>  maintained that we remodel our psychological geography when we read Dickens as he produces characters who exist not in detail not accurately or exactly but abundantly in a cluster of wild yet extraordinarily revealing remarks</span>
				<span class='text'> One character vividly drawn throughout his novels is London itself</span>
				<span class='text'>From the s on the outskirts of the city to the lower reaches of the  all aspects of the capital are described over the course of his body of work</span>
				<span class='text'>uthors frequently draw their portraits of characters from people they have known in real life</span>
				<span class='text'>David Copperfield is regarded by many as a veiled autobiography of Dickens</span>
				<span class='text'>The scenes of interminable court cases and legal arguments in Bleak House lect Dickenss experiences as a law clerk and court reporter and in particular his direct experience of the laws procedural delay during 1844 when he sued publishers in Chancery for breach of copyright</span>
				<span class='text'>  Dickenss father was sent to prison for debt and this became a common theme in many of his books with the detailed depiction of life in the Marshalsea prison in Little Dorrit resulting from Dickenss own experiences of the institution</span>
				<span class='text'>  Lucy Stroughill a childhood sweetheart may have affected several of Dickenss portraits of girls such as Little Emly in David Copperfield and Lucie Manette in A Tale of Two Cities</span>
				<span class='text'>  Dickens may have drawn on his childhood experiences but he was also ashamed of them and would not reveal that this was where he gathered his realistic accounts of squalor</span>
				<span class='text'>Very few knew the details of his early life until six years after his death when John Forster published a biography on which Dickens had collaborated</span>
				<span class='text'>Though Skimpole brutally sends up Leigh Hunt some critics have detected in his portrait features of Dickenss own character which he sought to exorcise by self parody</span>
				<span class='text'> Most of Dickenss major novels were first written in monthly or weekly instalments in journals such as Master Humphreys Clock and Household Words later reprinted in book form</span>
				<span class='text'>These instalments made the stories affordable and accessible and the series of regular  made each new episode widely anticipated</span>
				<span class='text'>When The Old Curiosity Shop was being serialised American fans waited at the docks in New York shouting out to the crew of an incoming ship Is little Nell dead</span>
				<span class='text'> Part of Dickenss great talent was to incorporate this episodic writing style but still end up with a coherent novel at the end</span>
				<span class='text'>nother important impact of Dickenss episodic writing style resulted from his exposure to the opinions of his readers and friends</span>
				<span class='text'>His friend Forster had a significant hand in reviewing his drafts an influence that went beyond matters of punctuation</span>
				<span class='text'>He toned down melodramatic and sensationalist exaggerations cut long passages such as the episode of Quilps drowning in The Old Curiosity Shop and made suggestions about plot and character</span>
				<span class='text'>It was he who suggested that Charley Bates should be redeemed in Oliver Twist</span>
				<span class='text'>Dickens had not thought of killing Little Nell and it was Forster who advised him to entertain this possibility as necessary to his conception of the heroine</span>
				<span class='text'> Dickens serialisation of his novels was not uncriticised by other authors</span>
				<span class='text'>In s novel  there is a comment by Captain Nares investigating an abandoned ship  See They were writing up the log said Nares pointing to the ink bottle</span>
				<span class='text'>Caught napping as usual</span>
				<span class='text'>I wonder if there ever was a captain yet that lost a ship with his log book up to date He generally has about a month to fill up on a clean break like Charles Dickens and his serial novels</span>

				<span class='text'>He was a fierce critic of the poverty and  of  society</span>
				<span class='text'>In a New York address he expressed his belief that Virtue shows quite as well in rags and patches as she does in purple and fine linen</span>
				<span class='text'>  Dickenss second novel Oliver Twist 1839 shocked readers with its images of poverty and crime it challenged middle class polemics about criminals making impossible any pretence to ignorance about what poverty entailed</span>
				<span class='text'> </span>
				<span class='text'>Dickens is often described as using idealised characters and highly sentimental scenes to contrast with his s and the ugly social truths he reveals</span>
				<span class='text'>The story of Nell Trent in The Old Curiosity Shop 1841 was received as extraordinarily moving by contemporary readers but viewed as ludicrously sentimental by </span>
				<span class='text'>You would need to have a heart of stone he declared in one of his famous witticisms not to laugh at the death of little Nell</span>
				<span class='text'>In conversation with </span>
				<span class='text'>  stated It is not the death of little Nell but the life of little Nell that I object to arguing that the maudlin effect of his description of her life owed much to the gregarious nature of Dickenss grief his despotic use of peoples feelings to move them to tears in works like this</span>
				<span class='text'> The question as to whether Dickens belongs to the tradition of the  is debatable</span>
				<span class='text'>Valerie Purton in her recent Dickens and the Sentimental Tradition sees him continuing aspects of this tradition and argues that his sentimental scenes and characters are as crucial to the overall power of the novels as his darker or comic figures and scenes and that Dombey and Son is  </span>

				<span class='text'> The Encyclopædia Britannica online comments that despite patches of emotional excess such as the reported death of Tiny Tim in A Christmas Carol 1843 Dickens cannot really be termed a sentimental novelist</span>
				<span class='text'>In Oliver Twist Dickens provides readers with an idealised portrait of a boy so inherently and unrealistically good that his values are never subverted by either brutal orphanages or coerced involvement in a gang of young </span>
				<span class='text'>While later novels also centre on idealised characters Esther Summerson in Bleak House and Amy Dorrit in Little Dorrit this idealism serves only to highlight Dickenss goal of poignant social commentary</span>
				<span class='text'>Dickenss fiction lecting what he believed to be true of his own life makes frequent use of coincidence either for comic effect or to emphasise the idea of providence</span>
				<span class='text'>  Oliver Twist turns out to be the lost nephew of the upper class family that randomly rescues him from the dangers of the pickpocket group</span>
				<span class='text'>Such coincidences are a staple of 18th century picaresque novels such as Henry Fieldings  which Dickens enjoyed reading as a youth</span>

				<span class='text'> and remains one of the best known and most read of English authors</span>
				<span class='text'>His works have never gone   and have been adapted continually for the screen since the invention of cinema</span>

				<span class='text'> According to the historian  the current state of the observance of Christmas is largely the result of a mid Victorian revival of the holiday spearheaded by A Christmas Carol</span>
				<span class='text'>Dickens catalysed the emerging Christmas as a family centred festival of generosity in contrast to the dwindling community based and church centred observations as new middle class expectations arose</span>
				<span class='text'>  Its archetypal figures Scrooge Tiny Tim the Christmas ghosts entered into Western cultural consciousness</span>
				<span class='text'>A prominent phrase from the tale  was popularised following the appearance of the story</span>

				<span class='text'>name Callow2009  At a time when Britain was the major economic and political power of the world Dickens highlighted the life of the forgotten poor and disadvantaged within society</span>
				<span class='text'>Through his journalism he campaigned on specific issues—such as  and the —but his fiction probably demonstrated its greatest prowess in changing public opinion in regard to class inequalities</span>
				<span class='text'>He often depicted the exploitation and oppression of the poor and condemned the public officials and institutions that not only allowed such abuses to exist but flourished as a result</span>
				<span class='text'>His most strident indictment of this condition is in Hard Times 1854 Dickenss only novel length treatment of the industrial working class</span>
				<span class='text'>In this work he uses vitriol and satire to illustrate how this marginalised social stratum was termed Hands by the factory owners that is not really people but rather only appendages of the machines they operated</span>
