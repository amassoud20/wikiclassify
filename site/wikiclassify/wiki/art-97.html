				<span class='text'>He created some of the world's best-known fictional characters and is regarded as the greatest novelist of the [[Victorian era]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{harvnb|Black|2007|p=735}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime, and by the twentieth century critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius</span>
				<span class='text'>His novels and short stories enjoy lasting popularity</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mazzeno|2008|p=76}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterton|2005|pp=100–126}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Born in [[Portsmouth]], Dickens left school to work in a factory when his father was incarcerated in a [[debtors' prison]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite his lack of formal education, he edited a weekly journal for 20 years, wrote 15 novels, five novellas, hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles, lectured and performed extensively, was an indefatigable letter writer, and campaigned vigorously for children's rights, education, and other social reforms</span>
				<span class='text'>ickens's literary success began with the 1836 serial publication of ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Within a few years he had become an international literary celebrity, famous for his humour, satire, and keen observation of character and society</span>
				<span class='text'>His novels, most published in monthly or weekly instalments, pioneered the [[serial (literature)|serial]] publication of narrative fiction, which became the dominant Victorian mode for novel publication</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The instalment format allowed Dickens to evaluate his audience's reaction, and he often modified his plot and character development based on such feedback</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Lodge 2002 118&quot;/&gt; For example, when his wife's [[chiropodist]] expressed distress at the way Miss Mowcher in ''[[David Copperfield]]'' seemed to reflect her disabilities, Dickens improved the character with positive features</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ziegler|2007|pp=46–47}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; His plots were carefully constructed, and he often wove elements from topical events into his narratives</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stone|1987|pp=267–268}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Masses of the illiterate poor chipped in [[Halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|ha'pennies]] to have each new monthly episode read to them, opening up and inspiring a new class of readers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hauser|1999|p=116}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Dickens was regarded as the literary colossus of his age</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cain|2008|p=1}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; His 1843 novella, ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', remains popular and continues to inspire adaptations in every artistic genre</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[Oliver Twist]]'' and ''[[Great Expectations]]'' are also frequently adapted, and, like many of his novels, evoke images of early Victorian London</span>
				<span class='text'>His 1859 novel, ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'', set in London and Paris, is his best-known work of historical fiction</span>
				<span class='text'>Dickens's creative genius has been praised by fellow writers—from [[Leo Tolstoy]] to [[George Orwell]] and [[G</span>
				<span class='text'>K</span>
				<span class='text'>Chesterton]]—for its [[Realism (arts)|realism]], comedy, prose style, unique characterisations, and [[Child labour#Historical|social criticism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>On the other hand, [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Henry James]], and [[Virginia Woolf]] complained of a lack of psychological depth, loose writing, and a vein of saccharine sentimentalism</span>
				<span class='text'>The term ''Dickensian'' is used to describe something that is reminiscent of Dickens and his writings, such as poor social conditions or comically repulsive characters</span>

				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt;]]Charles John Huffam Dickens was born on 7 February 1812, at 1 Mile End Terrace (now 393 Commercial Road), [[Landport]] in [[Portsea Island]] ([[Portsmouth]]), the second of eight children of [[John Dickens]] (1785–1851) and [[Elizabeth Dickens]] (née Barrow; 1789–1863)</span>
				<span class='text'>His father was a clerk in the Navy Pay Office and was temporarily stationed in the district</span>
				<span class='text'>He asked Christopher Huffam,&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1999&quot;&gt;West, Gilian</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Huffam and Son</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; rigger to His Majesty's Navy, gentleman, and head of an established firm, to act as godfather to Charles</span>
				<span class='text'>Huffam is thought to be the inspiration for Paul Dombey, the owner of a shipping company in Dickens's eponymous ''[[Dombey and Son]]'' (1848)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1999&quot;/&gt;In January 1815 John Dickens was called back to London, and the family moved to Norfolk Street, [[Fitzrovia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Charles Dickens and the Great Theatre of the World, Simon Callow, p</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt; When Charles was four, they relocated to [[Sheerness]], and thence to [[Chatham, Medway|Chatham]], Kent, where he spent his formative years until the age of 11</span>
				<span class='text'>His early life seems to have been idyllic, though he thought himself a &quot;very small and not-over-particularly-taken-care-of boy&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Forster|2006|p=13}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Charles spent time outdoors but also read voraciously, including the [[picaresque novel]]s of [[Tobias Smollett]] and [[Henry Fielding]], as well as ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' and ''[[Gil Blas]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>He read and reread ''[[The Arabian Nights]]'' and the Collected Farces of [[Elizabeth Inchbald]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Simon Callow, Charles Dickens and the Great Theatre of the World, p</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt; He retained poignant memories of childhood, helped by an excellent memory of people and events, which he used in his writing</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|pp=22–24:29–30}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; His father's brief work as a clerk in the Navy Pay Office afforded him a few years of private education, first at a [[dame school]], and then at a school run by William Giles, a [[English Dissenters|dissenter]], in Chatham</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=41}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Dickens-at-the-Blacking-Warehouse</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;]]This period came to an end in June 1822, when John Dickens was recalled to Navy Pay Office headquarters at [[Somerset House]], and the family—minus Charles, who stayed behind to finish his final term of work—moved to [[Camden Town]] in London</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Simon Callow, p</span>
				<span class='text'>3&lt;/ref&gt; The family had left Kent amidst rapidly mounting debts, and, living beyond his means,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=76}}:'recklessly improvident'</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; John Dickens was forced by his creditors into the [[Marshalsea]] [[debtors' prison]] in [[Southwark]], London in 1824</span>
				<span class='text'>His wife and youngest children joined him there, as was the practice at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>Charles, then 12 years old, boarded with Elizabeth Roylance, a family friend, at 112 College Place, Camden Town</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pope-Hennessy|1945|p=11}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Roylance was &quot;a reduced [impoverished] old lady, long known to our family&quot;, whom Dickens later immortalised, &quot;with a few alterations and embellishments&quot;, as &quot;Mrs</span>
				<span class='text'>Pipchin&quot; in ''Dombey and Son''</span>
				<span class='text'>Later, he lived in a back-attic in the house of an agent for the [[Insolvency|Insolvent Court]], Archibald Russell, &quot;a fat, good-natured, kind old gentleman</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>with a quiet old wife&quot; and lame son, in [[Lant Street]] in Southwark</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Forster|2006|p=27}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; They provided the inspiration for the Garlands in ''[[The Old Curiosity Shop]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=76}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;On Sundays—with his sister Frances, free from her studies at the [[Royal Academy of Music]]—he spent the day at the Marshalsea</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|1972|p=53}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Dickens later used the prison as a setting in ''[[Little Dorrit]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>To pay for his board and to help his family, Dickens was forced to leave school and work ten-hour days at Warren's [[shoe polish|Blacking]] Warehouse, on Hungerford Stairs, near the present [[Charing Cross railway station]], where he earned six [[shilling]]s a week pasting labels on pots of boot blacking</span>
				<span class='text'>The strenuous and often harsh working conditions made a lasting impression on Dickens and later influenced his fiction and essays, becoming the foundation of his interest in the reform of socio-economic and labour conditions, the rigours of which he believed were unfairly borne by the poor</span>
				<span class='text'>He later wrote that he wondered &quot;how I could have been so easily cast away at such an age&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Foster23/&gt; As he recalled to [[John Forster (biographer)|John Forster]] (from ''The Life of Charles Dickens''):&lt;blockquote&gt;The blacking-warehouse was the last house on the left-hand side of the way, at old Hungerford Stairs</span>
				<span class='text'>It was a crazy, tumble-down old house, abutting of course on the river, and literally overrun with rats</span>
				<span class='text'>Its wainscoted rooms, and its rotten floors and staircase, and the old grey rats swarming down in the cellars, and the sound of their squeaking and scuffling coming up the stairs at all times, and the dirt and decay of the place, rise up visibly before me, as if I were there again</span>
				<span class='text'>The counting-house was on the first floor, looking over the coal-barges and the river</span>
				<span class='text'>There was a recess in it, in which I was to sit and work</span>
				<span class='text'>My work was to cover the pots of paste-blacking; first with a piece of oil-paper, and then with a piece of blue paper; to tie them round with a string; and then to clip the paper close and neat, all round, until it looked as smart as a pot of ointment from an apothecary's shop</span>
				<span class='text'>When a certain number of grosses of pots had attained this pitch of perfection, I was to paste on each a printed label, and then go on again with more pots</span>
				<span class='text'>Two or three other boys were kept at similar duty down-stairs on similar wages</span>
				<span class='text'>One of them came up, in a ragged apron and a paper cap, on the first Monday morning, to show me the trick of using the string and tying the knot</span>
				<span class='text'>His name was Bob Fagin; and I took the liberty of using his name, long afterwards, in Oliver Twist</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Foster23&gt;{{harvnb|Forster|2006|pp=23–24}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;When the warehouse was moved to Chandos Street in the smart, busy district of [[Covent Garden]] the boys worked in a room in which the window gave onto the street and little audiences gathered and watched them at work—in Dickens biographer [[Simon Callow]]'s estimation, the public display was &quot;a new refinement added to his misery&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Callow, p</span>
				<span class='text'>5&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Courtyard of the former Marshalsea prison, 1897 (2)</span>
				<span class='text'>ng|upright|thumb|The [[Marshalsea]] around 1897, after it had closed]]A few months after his imprisonment, John Dickens's paternal grandmother, Elizabeth Dickens, died and bequeathed him £450</span>
				<span class='text'>On the expectation of this legacy, Dickens was released from prison</span>
				<span class='text'>Under the [[Act of Parliament|Insolvent Debtors Act]], Dickens arranged for payment of his creditors, and he and his family left Marshalsea,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schlicke|1999|p=157}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- not for the bequest --&gt; for the home of Mrs Roylance</span>
				<span class='text'>harles's mother, Elizabeth Dickens, did not immediately support his removal from the boot-blacking warehouse</span>
				<span class='text'>This influenced Dickens's view that a father should rule the family, and a mother find her proper sphere inside the home: &quot;I never afterwards forgot, I never shall forget, I never can forget, that my mother was warm for my being sent back&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>His mother's failure to request his return was a factor in his dissatisfied attitude towards women</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|1972|p=58}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Righteous indignation stemming from his own situation and the conditions under which [[working class|working-class]] people lived became major themes of his works, and it was this unhappy period in his youth to which he alluded in his favourite, and most [[autobiographical novel|autobiographical, novel]], ''[[David Copperfield]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cain|2008|p=91}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; &quot;I had no advice, no counsel, no encouragement, no consolation, no assistance, no support, of any kind, from anyone, that I can call to mind, as I hope to go to heaven!&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Wilson61&quot;/&gt;Dickens was eventually sent to the Wellington House Academy in [[Camden Town]], where he remained until March 1827, having spent about two years there</span>
				<span class='text'>He did not consider it to be a good school: &quot;Much of the haphazard, desultory teaching, poor discipline punctuated by the headmaster's sadistic brutality, the seedy ushers and general run-down atmosphere, are embodied in Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Creakle's Establishment in ''David Copperfield''</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Wilson61&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|1972|p=61}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Dickens worked at the law office of Ellis and Blackmore, attorneys, of Holborn Court, [[Gray's Inn]], as a junior [[law clerk|clerk]] from May 1827 to November 1828</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a gifted mimic and impersonated those around him: clients, lawyers, and clerks</span>
				<span class='text'>He went to theatres obsessively—he claimed that for at least three years he went to the theatre every single day</span>
				<span class='text'>His favourite actor was [[Charles Mathews]], and Dickens learnt his ''monopolylogues'', (farces in which Mathews played every character), by heart</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Callow, p</span>
				<span class='text'>4, 36&lt;/ref&gt; Then, having learned [[Thomas Gurney (shorthand writer)|Gurney's]] system of shorthand in his spare time, he left to become a freelance reporter</span>
				<span class='text'>A distant relative, Thomas Charlton, was a freelance reporter at [[Doctors' Commons]], and Dickens was able to share his box there to report the legal proceedings for nearly four years</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pope-Hennessy|1945|p=18}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|1972|p=64}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This education was to inform works such as ''[[Nicholas Nickleby]]'', ''Dombey and Son'', and especially ''Bleak House''—whose vivid portrayal of the machinations and bureaucracy of the legal system did much to enlighten the general public and served as a vehicle for dissemination of Dickens's own views regarding, particularly, the heavy burden on the poor who were forced by circumstances to &quot;go to law&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1830, Dickens met his first love, Maria Beadnell, thought to have been the model for the character Dora in ''David Copperfield''</span>
				<span class='text'>Maria's parents disapproved of the courtship and ended the relationship by sending her to school in Paris</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davis|1998|p=23}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Journalism and early novels==In 1832, at age 20, Dickens was energetic and increasingly self-confident</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Callow, p</span>
				<span class='text'>8&lt;/ref&gt; He enjoyed mimicry and popular entertainment, lacked a clear, specific sense of what he wanted to become, and yet knew he wanted fame</span>
				<span class='text'>Drawn to the theatre—he became an early member of the [[Garrick Club|Garrick]]&lt;ref&gt;Claire Tomalin, The Invisible Woman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt;—he landed an acting audition at Covent Garden, where the manager [[George Bartley (comedian)|George Bartley]] and the actor [[Charles Kemble]] were to see him</span>
				<span class='text'>Dickens prepared meticulously and decided to imitate the comedian Charles Mathews, but ultimately he missed the audition because of a cold</span>
				<span class='text'>Before another opportunity arose, he had set out on his career as a writer</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Claire Tomalin, the Invisible Woman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>6&lt;/ref&gt; In 1833 he submitted his first story, &quot;A Dinner at Poplar Walk&quot;, to the London periodical ''[[Monthly Magazine]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>He rented rooms at [[Furnival's Inn]] and worked as a political journalist, reporting on [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliamentary]] debates, and he travelled across Britain to cover election campaigns for the ''[[Morning Chronicle]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>His journalism, in the form of sketches in periodicals, formed his first collection of pieces, published in 1836: ''[[Sketches by Boz]]''—Boz being a family nickname he employed as a pseudonym for some years</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|pp= 174–176}}</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Dickens apparently adopted it from the nickname &quot;Moses&quot;, which he had given to his youngest brother [[Augustus Dickens]], after a character in Oliver Goldsmith's ''[[The Vicar of Wakefield]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>When pronounced by anyone with a head cold, &quot;Moses&quot; became &quot;Boses&quot;—later shortened to ''Boz''</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Dickens's own name was considered &quot;queer&quot; by a contemporary critic, who wrote in 1849: &quot;Mr Dickens, as if in revenge for his own queer name, does bestow still queerer ones upon his fictitious creations</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He contributed to and edited journals throughout his literary career</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;Patten(2001)16ff&quot;/&gt; In January 1835 the ''Morning Chronicle'' launched an evening edition, under the editorship of the ''Chronicle'''s music critic, [[George Hogarth]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Hogarth invited Dickens to contribute ''Street Sketches'' and Dickens became a regular visitor to his Fulham house, excited by Hogarth's friendship with a hero of his, [[Walter Scott]], and enjoying the company of Hogarth's three daughters—Georgina, Mary, and nineteen-year-old Catherine</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|left|Catherine Hogarth Dickens by [[Samuel Lawrence]] (1838)]]Dickens made rapid progress both professionally and socially</span>
				<span class='text'>He began a friendship with [[William Harrison Ainsworth]], the author of the highwayman novel ''[[Rookwood (novel)|Rookwood]]'' (1834), whose bachelor salon in [[Harrow Road]] had become the meeting place for a set that included [[Daniel Maclise]], [[Benjamin Disraeli]], [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]], and [[George Cruikshank]]</span>

				<span class='text'> Powell was also an author and poet and knew many of the famous writers of the day</span>
				<span class='text'>After further fraudulent activities,  Powell fled to New York and published a book called ''The Living Authors of England'' with a chapter on Charles Dickens, who was not amused by what Powell had written</span>
				<span class='text'> One item that seemed to have annoyed him was the assertion that he had based the character of Paul Dombey (''[[Dombey and Son]]''), on Thomas Chapman, one of the principal partners at John Chapman &amp; Co</span>
				<span class='text'> Dickens immediately fired off a letter to [[Lewis Gaylord Clark]], editor of the New York literary magazine ''[[The Knickerbocker]]'', saying that Powell was a forger and thief</span>
				<span class='text'> Clark published the letter in the ''[[New-York Tribune]]'' and several other papers picked up on the story</span>

				<span class='text'>]On 8 June 1870, Dickens suffered another stroke at his home after a full day's work on ''Edwin Drood''</span>
				<span class='text'>He never regained consciousness, and the next day, five years to the day after the Staplehurst rail crash, he died at Gad's Hill Place</span>

				<span class='text'>quot; Pointing to the fresh flowers that adorned the novelist's grave, Stanley assured those present that &quot;the spot would thenceforth be a sacred one with both the New World and the Old, as that of the representative of literature, not of this island only, but of all who speak our English tongue</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Dickens worked intensively on developing arresting names for his characters that would reverberate with associations for his readers, and assist the development of motifs in the storyline, giving what one critic calls an &quot;allegorical impetus&quot; to the novels' meanings</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; His literary style is also a mixture of [[fantasy]] and [[realism (arts)|realism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His satires of British aristocratic snobbery—he calls one character the &quot;Noble Refrigerator&quot;—are often popular</span>
				<span class='text'>Comparing orphans to stocks and shares, people to tug boats, or dinner-party guests to furniture are just some of Dickens's acclaimed flights of fancy</span>

				<span class='text'>Micawber]], [[Abel Magwitch]], [[Quilp|Daniel Quilp]], [[Samuel Pickwick]], [[Wackford Squeers]], and [[Uriah Heep]] are so well known as to be part and parcel of British culture, and in some cases have passed into ordinary language: a ''scrooge'', for example, is a miser</span>

				<span class='text'>''David Copperfield'' is regarded by many as a veiled autobiography of Dickens</span>
				<span class='text'>The scenes of interminable court cases and legal arguments in ''Bleak House'' reflect Dickens's experiences as a law clerk and court reporter, and in particular his direct experience of the law's procedural delay during 1844 when he sued publishers in Chancery for breach of copyright</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Polloczek|1999|p=133}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Dickens's father was sent to prison for debt, and this became a common theme in many of his books, with the detailed depiction of life in the Marshalsea prison in ''Little Dorrit'' resulting from Dickens's own experiences of the institution</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Lucy Stroughill, a childhood sweetheart, may have affected several of Dickens's portraits of girls such as Little Em'ly in ''David Copperfield'' and Lucie Manette in ''A Tale of Two Cities</span>

				<span class='text'>group=&quot;nb&quot;}} Dickens may have drawn on his childhood experiences, but he was also ashamed of them and would not reveal that this was where he gathered his realistic accounts of squalor</span>
				<span class='text'>Very few knew the details of his early life until six years after his death, when John Forster published a biography on which Dickens had collaborated</span>
				<span class='text'>Though Skimpole brutally sends up Leigh Hunt, some critics have detected in his portrait features of Dickens's own character, which he sought to exorcise by self-parody</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=653}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Episodic writing===Most of Dickens's major novels were first written in monthly or weekly instalments in journals such as ''Master Humphrey's Clock'' and ''Household Words'', later reprinted in book form</span>
				<span class='text'>These instalments made the stories affordable and accessible, and the series of regular [[cliffhanger|cliff-hangers]] made each new episode widely anticipated</span>
				<span class='text'>When ''The Old Curiosity Shop'' was being serialised, American fans waited at the docks in New York, shouting out to the crew of an incoming ship, &quot;Is little Nell dead?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Glancy|1999|p=34}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Part of Dickens's great talent was to incorporate this episodic writing style but still end up with a coherent novel at the end</span>

				<span class='text'>quot; Wood engraving from ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'', 7 December 1867]]Another important impact of Dickens's episodic writing style resulted from his exposure to the opinions of his readers and friends</span>
				<span class='text'>His friend Forster had a significant hand in reviewing his drafts, an influence that went beyond matters of punctuation</span>
				<span class='text'>He toned down melodramatic and sensationalist exaggerations, cut long passages (such as the episode of Quilp's drowning in ''The Old Curiosity Shop''), and made suggestions about plot and character</span>
				<span class='text'>It was he who suggested that Charley Bates should be redeemed in ''Oliver Twist''</span>
				<span class='text'>Dickens had not thought of killing Little Nell, and it was Forster who advised him to entertain this possibility as necessary to his conception of the heroine</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|1983|pp=166–169}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Dicken's serialisation of his novels was not uncriticised by other authors</span>
				<span class='text'>In [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s novel &quot;[[The Wrecker (Stevenson novel)|The Wrecker]]&quot;, there is a comment by Captain Nares, investigating an abandoned ship:  &quot;See! They were writing up the log,&quot; said Nares, pointing to the ink-bottle</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Caught napping, as usual</span>
				<span class='text'>I wonder if there ever was a captain yet that lost a ship with his log-book up to date? He generally has about a month to fill up on a clean break, like Charles Dickens and his serial novels</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;===Social commentary===Dickens's novels were, among other things, works of [[social commentary]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a fierce critic of the poverty and [[social stratification]] of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] society</span>
				<span class='text'>In a New York address, he expressed his belief that &quot;Virtue shows quite as well in rags and patches as she does in purple and fine linen&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=345}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Dickens's second novel, ''Oliver Twist'' (1839), shocked readers with its images of poverty and crime: it challenged middle class polemics about criminals, making impossible any pretence to ignorance about what poverty entailed</span>

				<span class='text'>The story of Nell Trent in ''The Old Curiosity Shop'' (1841) was received as extraordinarily moving by contemporary readers but viewed as ludicrously sentimental by [[Oscar Wilde]]</span>

				<span class='text'>While later novels also centre on idealised characters (Esther Summerson in ''Bleak House'' and Amy Dorrit in ''Little Dorrit''), this idealism serves only to highlight Dickens's goal of poignant social commentary</span>
				<span class='text'>Dickens's fiction, reflecting what he believed to be true of his own life, makes frequent use of coincidence, either for comic effect or to emphasise the idea of providence</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marlow|1994|pp=149–150}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Oliver Twist turns out to be the lost nephew of the upper-class family that randomly rescues him from the dangers of the pickpocket group</span>
				<span class='text'>Such coincidences are a staple of 18th-century picaresque novels, such as Henry Fielding's ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]],'' which Dickens enjoyed reading as a youth</span>

				<span class='text'>Leo Tolstoy, G</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;''A Christmas Carol'' is most likely his best-known story, with frequent new adaptations</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; According to the historian [[Ronald Hutton]], the current state of the observance of Christmas is largely the result of a mid-Victorian revival of the holiday spearheaded by ''A Christmas Carol''</span>
				<span class='text'>Dickens catalysed the emerging Christmas as a family-centred festival of generosity, in contrast to the dwindling community-based and church-centred observations, as new middle-class expectations arose</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hutton|2001|p=188}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Its archetypal figures (Scrooge, Tiny Tim, the Christmas ghosts) entered into Western cultural consciousness</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The term Scrooge became a synonym for miser,&lt;!-- already stated above --&gt; and his dismissive exclamation [[Humbug|'Bah! Humbug!']] likewise gained currency as an idiom</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|[[Bleak House, Broadstairs|Bleak House]] in [[Broadstairs]], Kent, where Dickens wrote some of his novels]]At a time when Britain was the major economic and political power of the world, Dickens highlighted the life of the forgotten poor and disadvantaged within society</span>
				<span class='text'>Through his journalism he campaigned on specific issues—such as [[sanitation]] and the [[workhouse]]—but his fiction probably demonstrated its greatest prowess in changing public opinion in regard to class inequalities</span>
				<span class='text'>He often depicted the exploitation and oppression of the poor and condemned the public officials and institutions that not only allowed such abuses to exist, but flourished as a result</span>
				<span class='text'>His most strident indictment of this condition is in ''Hard Times'' (1854), Dickens's only novel-length treatment of the industrial working class</span>
				<span class='text'>In this work, he uses vitriol and satire to illustrate how this marginalised social stratum was termed &quot;Hands&quot; by the factory owners; that is, not really &quot;people&quot; but rather only appendages of the machines they operated</span>
				<span class='text'>His writings inspired others, in particular journalists and political figures, to address such problems of class oppression</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, the prison scenes in ''The Pickwick Papers'' are claimed to have been influential in having the [[Fleet Prison]] shut down</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Karl Marx]] asserted that Dickens &quot;issued to the world more political and social truths than have been uttered by all the professional politicians, publicists and moralists put together&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;KucichSadoff&quot; /&gt; The exceptional popularity of Dickens's novels, even those with socially oppositional themes (''Bleak House'', 1853; ''Little Dorrit'', 1857; ''Our Mutual Friend'', 1865), not only underscored his almost preternatural ability to create compelling storylines and unforgettable characters, but also ensured that the Victorian public confronted issues of social justice that had commonly been ignored</span>
				<span class='text'>It has been argued that his technique of flooding his narratives with an 'unruly superfluity of material' that, in the gradual dénouement, yields up an unsuspected order, influenced the organisation of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''</span>
