				<span class='text'>For $150 in gold, he acquired a [[handcar]] and the services of three Mexicans, whom he disarmed</span>
				<span class='text'>MacArthur and his party located five engines in Alvarado, two of which were only [[switcher]]s, but the other three locomotives were exactly what was required</span>
				<span class='text'>On the way back to Veracruz, his party was set upon by five armed men</span>
				<span class='text'>The party made a run for it and outdistanced all but two of the armed men, whom MacArthur shot</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon after, they were attacked by a group of about fifteen horsemen</span>
				<span class='text'>MacArthur took three bullet holes in his clothes but was unharmed</span>

				<span class='text'>A multi-pronged approach was employed to solve this problem</span>
				<span class='text'>Disassembled [[landing craft]] were shipped to Australia, where they were assembled in Cairns</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Casey|1959|pp=31–33}} The range of these small landing craft was to be greatly extended by the [[Amphibious warfare ship|landing ships]] of the [[VII Amphibious Force]], which began arriving in late 1942, and formed part of the newly formed [[Seventh Fleet]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Morison|1950|pp=130–132}} Since the Seventh Fleet had no aircraft carriers, the range of naval operations was limited by that of the fighter aircraft of the [[Fifth Air Force]]</span>

				<span class='text'>As a result, &quot;it became obvious that any military offensive in the South-West Pacific in 1943 would have to be carried out mainly by the Australian Army</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Dexter|1961|p=12}} The offensive began with the [[landing at Lae]] by the [[9th Division (Australia)|Australian 9th Division]] on 4 September 1943</span>

				<span class='text'>Here, the offensive bogged down, partly because MacArthur had based his decision to assault Finschhafen on Willoughby's assessment that there were only 350 Japanese defenders at Finschhafen, when in fact there were nearly 5,000</span>

				<span class='text'>Although they were out of range of the Fifth Air Force's fighters based in the Ramu Valley, the timing of the operation allowed the aircraft carriers of Nimitz's [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]] to provide air support</span>

				<span class='text'>Because the Japanese were not expecting an attack, the garrison was weak, and Allied casualties were correspondingly light</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Mossman|Stark|1991|pp=236–253}}In 1960, the mayor of Norfolk, Virginia, had proposed using funds raised by public contribution to remodel the old Norfolk courthouse as a memorial to General MacArthur and as a repository for his papers, decorations, and mementos he had accepted</span>
				<span class='text'>Restored and remodeled, the building contains nine museum galleries whose contents reflect the general's 50 years of military service</span>
				<span class='text'>At the heart of the memorial is a rotunda</span>
				<span class='text'>In its center lies a sunken circular crypt with two marble sarcophagi, one for MacArthur,{{sfn|Mossman|Stark|1991|p=253}} the other for Jean, who continued to live in the Waldorf Towers until her own death in 2000</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;JeanObit&quot; /&gt;===Legacy===MacArthur has quite a controversial legacy</span>
				<span class='text'>In the Philippines in 1942, he suffered a defeat that [[Gavin Long]] described as &quot;the greatest in the history of American foreign wars</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Long|1969|p=226}} His broad concept of the role of the soldier as encompassing civil affairs, quelling riots and low-level conflict, was passed over by the majority of officers who had fought in Europe during World War II, and afterwards saw the Army's role as fighting the Soviet Union</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Frank|2007|p=168}} Unlike them, in his victories in New Guinea in 1944, the Philippines in 1945 and Korea in 1950, he fought outnumbered, and relied on maneuver and firepower for success</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Long|1969|p=227}} It was his relief that had the greatest impact, as it cast a long shadow over American civil-military relations for decades</span>
				<span class='text'>When Lyndon Johnson met with General [[William Westmoreland]] in Honolulu in 1966, he told him: &quot;General, I have a lot riding on you</span>
				<span class='text'>I hope you don't pull a MacArthur on me</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Danner|1993|pp=14–15}} MacArthur's relief &quot;left a lasting current of popular sentiment that in matters of war and peace, the military really knows best,&quot; a philosophy which became known as &quot;MacArthurism</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MacArthurism&quot; /&gt;MacArthur remains a controversial and enigmatic figure</span>
				<span class='text'>He has been portrayed as a reactionary, although he was in many respects ahead of his time</span>
				<span class='text'>He championed a progressive approach to the reconstruction of Japanese society, arguing that all occupations ultimately ended badly for the occupier and the occupied</span>
				<span class='text'>He was often out of step with his contemporaries, such as in 1941 when he contended that Nazi Germany could not defeat the Soviet Union, when he argued that North Korea and China were no mere Soviet puppets, and throughout his career in his insistence that the future lay in the Far East</span>
				<span class='text'>This implicitly rejected White American contemporary notions of their own racial superiority</span>
				<span class='text'>He always treated Filipino and Japanese leaders with respect as equals</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time, his Victorian sensibilities recoiled at leveling Manila with aerial bombing, an attitude the hardened World War II generation regarded as old fashioned</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Frank|2007|pp=167–174}} When asked about MacArthur, Blamey once said that &quot;The best and the worst things you hear about him are both true</span>
