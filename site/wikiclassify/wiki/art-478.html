				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|''[[A Legend of Montrose]]'', illustration from the 1872 edition]]Although Scott had attained world-wide celebrity through his poetry, he soon tried his hand at documenting his researches into the oral tradition of the Scottish Borders in prose fiction—stories and novels—at the time still considered aesthetically inferior to poetry (above all to such classical [[genre]]s as the epic or poetic tragedy) as a [[Mimesis|mimetic]] vehicle for portraying historical events</span>
				<span class='text'>In an innovative and astute action, he wrote and published his [[debut novel|first novel]], ''[[Waverley (novel)|Waverley]]'', anonymously in 1814</span>
				<span class='text'>It was a tale of the [[Jacobite rising]] of 1745</span>
				<span class='text'>Its English protagonist, Edward Waverley, like [[Don Quixote]] a great reader of romances, has been brought up by his Tory uncle, who is sympathetic to [[Jacobitism]], although Edward's own father is a Whig</span>
				<span class='text'>The youthful Waverley obtains a commission in the Whig army and is posted in [[Dundee]]</span>
				<span class='text'>On leave, he meets his uncle's friend, the Jacobite Baron Bradwardine and is attracted to the Baron's daughter Rose</span>
				<span class='text'>On a visit to the Highlands, Edward overstays his leave and is arrested and charged with desertion but is rescued by the Highland chieftain Fergus MacIvor and his mesmerizing sister Flora, whose devotion to the Stuart cause, &quot;as it exceeded her brother's in fanaticism, excelled it also in purity&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'> Through Flora, Waverley meets [[Charles Edward Stuart|Bonnie Prince Charlie]], and under her influence goes over to the Jacobite side and takes part in the [[Battle of Prestonpans]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He escapes retribution, however, after saving the life of a Whig colonel during the battle</span>
				<span class='text'>Waverley (whose surname name reflects his divided loyalties) eventually decides to lead a peaceful life of establishment respectability under the [[House of Hanover]] rather than live as a proscribed rebel</span>
				<span class='text'>He chooses to marry the beautiful Rose Bradwardine, rather than cast his lot with the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] Flora MacIvor, who, after the failure of the '45 rising, retires to a French convent</span>
				<span class='text'>here followed a succession of novels over the next five years, each with a Scottish historical setting</span>
				<span class='text'>Mindful of his reputation as a poet, Scott maintained the anonymity he had begun with ''Waverley'',  publishing the novels under the name &quot;Author of Waverley&quot; or as &quot;Tales of</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot; with no author</span>
				<span class='text'>Among those familiar with his poetry, his identity became an open secret, but Scott persisted in maintaining the façade, perhaps because he thought his old-fashioned father would disapprove of his engaging in such a trivial pursuit as novel writing</span>
				<span class='text'>During this time Scott became known by the nickname &quot;The Wizard of the North&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1815 he was given the honour of dining with [[George IV of Great Britain|George, Prince Regent]], who wanted to meet the &quot;Author of Waverley&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>]Scott's 1819 series ''[[Tales of my Landlord]]'' is sometimes considered a subset of the ''Waverley'' novels and was intended to illustrate aspects of Scottish regional life</span>
				<span class='text'>Among the best known is ''[[The Bride of Lammermoor]]'', a fictionalized version of an actual incident in the history of the [[James Dalrymple, 1st Viscount of Stair#Biography|Dalrymple]] family that took place in the [[Lammermuir Hills]] in 1669</span>
				<span class='text'>In the novel, Lucie Ashton and the nobly born but now dispossessed and impoverished Edgar Ravenswood exchange vows</span>
				<span class='text'>But the Ravenswoods and the wealthy Ashtons, who now own the former Ravenswood lands, are enemies, and Lucie's mother forces her daughter to break her engagement to Edgar and marry the wealthy Sir Arthur Bucklaw</span>
				<span class='text'>Lucie falls into a depression and on their wedding night stabs the bridegroom, succumbs to insanity, and dies</span>

				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt; Scott's background as a lawyer also informed his perspective, for at the time of the novel, which takes place before the [[Act of Union of 1707]], English law did not apply in Scotland, and afterwards Scotland has continued to have its own [[Scots law]] as a hybrid legal system</span>
				<span class='text'>A recent critic, who is a legal as well as a literary scholar, argues that ''Old Mortality'' not only reflects the dispute between Stuart's [[absolute monarchy]] and the jurisdiction of the courts, but also invokes a foundational moment in British sovereignty, namely, the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1679|Habeas Corpus Act]] (also known as the [[Habeas corpus|Great Writ]]), passed by the [[English Parliament]] in 1679</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See Amy Witherbee, in  &quot;Habeas Corpus: British Imaginations of Power in Walter Scott's ''Old Mortality''&quot;, ''New Literary History'' 39 (2008): 355–67, writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;By the 1670s, conﬂicts between religious dissidents and the Stuart Crown had given way to a Crown policy of seizing and imprisoning opponents without recourse to the courts</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1679, this policy of using extrajudicial imprisonments to quell rebellion ﬁnally provoked the English Parliament to pass the Act of Habeas Corpus in England</span>
				<span class='text'>Usually translated as “produce the body,” habeas corpus could be invoked by any subject to require that the king or his agents produce the body of a prisoner for adjudication before the courts</span>
				<span class='text'>In its barest terms the Great Writ protected a subject from indeﬁnite terms of imprisonment, from imprisonment outside the kingdom, or from imprisonment without cause</span>
				<span class='text'>It did so by asserting the jurisdiction of the courts as superior to the executive powers of the king</span>
				<span class='text'>The Act was thus part of a long debate within the three kingdoms about the relationship of king to law and vice versa</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Oblique reference to the origin of ''Habeas corpus'' underlies Scott's next novel, ''[[Ivanhoe]]'', set during the era of the creation of the [[Magna Carta]], which political conservatives like Walter Scott and [[Edmund Burke]] regarded as rooted in immemorial British custom and precedent</span>
				<span class='text'>'[[Ivanhoe]]'' (1819), set in 12th-century England, marked a move away from Scott's focus on the local history of Scotland</span>
				<span class='text'>Based partly on [[David Hume|Hume's]] ''[[The History of England (Hume)|History of England]]'' and the ballad cycle of [[Robin Hood]], ''Ivanhoe'' was quickly translated into many languages and inspired countless imitations and theatrical adaptations</span>
				<span class='text'>''Ivanhoe'' depicts the cruel tyranny of the Norman overlords ([[Norman Yoke]])  over the impoverished Saxon populace of England, with two of the main characters, Rowena and Locksley ([[Robin Hood]]), representing the dispossessed Saxon aristocracy</span>
				<span class='text'>When the protagonists are captured and imprisoned by a Norman baron, Scott interrupts the story to exclaim:{{bq|1=It is grievous to think that those valiant barons, to whose stand against the crown the liberties of England were indebted for their existence, should themselves have been such dreadful oppressors, and capable of excesses contrary not only to the laws of England, but to those of nature and humanity</span>
				<span class='text'>But, alas&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>iction itself can hardly reach the dark reality of the horrors of the period</span>
				<span class='text'>(Chapter 24</span>
				<span class='text'>3)}}The institution of the [[Magna Carta]], which happens outside the time frame of the story, is portrayed as a progressive (incremental) reform, but also as a step towards the recovery of a lost golden age of liberty endemic to England and the English system</span>
				<span class='text'>Scott puts a derisive prophecy in the mouth of the jester Wamba:{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Norman saw on English oak</span>
				<span class='text'>n English neck a Norman yoke;Norman spoon to English dish,And England ruled as Normans wish;Blithe world in England never will be more,Till England's rid of all the four</span>
				<span class='text'>(''Ivanhoe'', Ch</span>
				<span class='text'>xxvii)&lt;/poem&gt;}}Although on the surface an entertaining escapist romance, alert contemporary readers would have quickly recognised the political subtext of ''Ivanhoe'', which appeared immediately after the English Parliament, fearful of French-style revolution in the aftermath of [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]], had passed the [[Habeas Corpus Suspension Act 1817|Habeas Corpus Suspension acts of 1817 and 1818]] and other extremely repressive measures, and when traditional English Charter rights versus revolutionary human rights was a topic of discussion</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Witherbee (2008), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>363–64</span>
				<span class='text'>Habeas corpus had been suspended in the mid-1790s at the time of the French Revolution by [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]], who had called the French declaration of human rights &quot;monstrous&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Widely publicised trials for sedition took place in Edinburgh (1793) and in London (1794) [[John Thelwall]] and two others were charged with treason</span>
				<span class='text'>The Scottish defendants received harsh sentences whereas the English ones were acquitted</span>
				<span class='text'>According to historian [http://ageofrevolution</span>

				<span class='text'>tml Anne Stott]: &quot;The difference between the English and Scottish trials reflects the different legal systems</span>
				<span class='text'>Ironically, the acquittals made the loyalist case—that England was a country where a man could have a fair trial</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt;''Ivanhoe'' was also remarkable in its sympathetic portrayal of Jewish characters: Rebecca, considered by many critics the book's real heroine, does not in the end get to marry Ivanhoe, whom she loves, but Scott allows her to remain faithful to her own religion, rather than having her convert to Christianity</span>
				<span class='text'>Likewise, her father, Isaac of York, a Jewish moneylender, is shown as a victim rather than a villain</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''Ivanhoe'', which is one of Scott's Waverley novels, religious and sectarian fanatics are the villains, while the [[eponym]]ous hero is a bystander who must weigh the evidence and decide where to take a stand</span>
				<span class='text'>Scott's positive portrayal of Judaism, which reflects his humanity and concern for religious toleration, also coincided with a contemporary movement for the [[Emancipation of the Jews in England]]</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright]]Although he continued to be extremely popular and widely read, both at home and abroad,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;…it would be difficult to name, from among both modern and ancient works, many read more widely and with greater pleasure than the historical novels of … Walter Scott</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; – [[Alessandro Manzoni]], ''On the Historical Novel''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Scott's critical reputation declined in the last half of the 19th century as serious writers turned from romanticism to realism, and Scott began to be regarded as an author suitable for children</span>
				<span class='text'>This trend accelerated in the 20th century</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, in his classic study  ''[[Aspects of the Novel]]'' (1927), [[E</span>
				<span class='text'>M</span>
				<span class='text'>Forster]] harshly criticized Scott's clumsy and slapdash writing style, &quot;flat&quot; characters, and thin plots</span>
				<span class='text'>In contrast, the novels of Scott's contemporary [[Jane Austen]], once appreciated only by the discerning few (including, as it happened, Sir Walter Scott himself) rose steadily in critical esteem, though Austen, as a female writer, was still faulted for her narrow (&quot;feminine&quot;) choice of subject matter, which, unlike Scott, avoided the grand historical themes traditionally viewed as masculine</span>
				<span class='text'>evertheless, Scott's importance as an innovator continued to be recognized</span>
				<span class='text'>He was acclaimed as the inventor of the genre of the modern [[historical novel]] (which others trace to [[Jane Porter]], whose work in the genre predates Scott's) and the inspiration for enormous numbers of imitators and genre writers both in Britain and on the European continent</span>
				<span class='text'>In the cultural sphere, Scott's Waverley novels played a significant part in the movement (begun with [[James Macpherson]]'s ''[[Ossian]]'' cycle) in rehabilitating the public perception of the [[Scottish Highlands]] and its culture, which had been formally suppressed as barbaric, and viewed in the southern mind as a breeding ground of hill bandits, religious fanaticism, and [[Jacobitism|Jacobite rebellions]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Scott served as chairman of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] and was also a member of the [[Royal Celtic Society]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His own contribution to the reinvention of Scottish culture was enormous, even though his re-creations of the customs of the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] were fanciful at times, despite his extensive travels around his native country</span>
				<span class='text'>It is a testament to Scott's contribution in creating a unified identity for Scotland that Edinburgh's central railway station, opened in 1854 by the [[North British Railway]], is called [[Edinburgh Waverley railway station|Waverley]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The fact that Scott was a [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowland]] [[Church of Scotland|Presbyterian]], rather than a Gaelic-speaking Catholic Highlander, made him more acceptable to a conservative English reading public</span>
				<span class='text'>Scott's novels were certainly influential in the making of the Victorian craze for all things Scottish among British royalty, who were anxious to claim legitimacy through their rather attenuated historical connection with the royal house of Stuart</span>
				<span class='text'>t the time Scott wrote, Scotland was poised to move away from an era of socially divisive clan warfare to a modern world of literacy and industrial capitalism</span>
				<span class='text'>Through the medium of Scott's novels, the violent religious and political conflicts of the country's recent past could be seen as belonging to history—which Scott defined, as the subtitle of ''Waverley'' (&quot;'Tis Sixty Years Since&quot;) indicates, as something that happened at least 60 years ago</span>
				<span class='text'>Scott's advocacy of objectivity and moderation and his strong repudiation of political violence on either side also had a strong, though unspoken, contemporary resonance in an era when many conservative English speakers lived in mortal fear of a revolution in the French style on British soil</span>
				<span class='text'>Scott's orchestration of [[Visit of King George IV to Scotland|King George IV's visit to Scotland]], in 1822, was a pivotal event intended to inspire a view of his home country that, in his view, accentuated the positive aspects of the past while allowing the age of quasi-medieval blood-letting to be put to rest, while envisioning a more useful, peaceful future</span>
				<span class='text'>fter Scott's work had been essentially unstudied for many decades, a small revival of critical interest began in the 1970s and 1980s</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Postmodern]] tastes favoured discontinuous narratives and the introduction of the &quot;first person&quot;, yet they were more favourable to Scott's work than Modernist tastes</span>
				<span class='text'>[[F</span>
				<span class='text'>R</span>
				<span class='text'>Leavis]] had disdained Scott, seeing him as a thoroughly bad novelist and a thoroughly bad influence (''[[The Great Tradition]]'' [1948]); Marilyn Butler, however, offered a political reading of the fiction of the period that found a great deal of genuine interest in his work (''Romantics, Revolutionaries, and Reactionaries'' [1981])</span>
				<span class='text'>Scott is now seen as an important innovator and a key figure in the development of Scottish and world literature</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1826, there was outrage in Scotland at the attempt of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] to prevent the production of banknotes of less than five pounds</span>
				<span class='text'>Scott wrote a series of letters to the ''Edinburgh Weekly Journal'' under the pseudonym &quot;''[[Malachi Malagrowther]]''&quot; for retaining the right of Scottish banks to issue their own banknotes</span>
				<span class='text'>This provoked such a response that the Government was forced to relent and allow the Scottish banks to continue printing pound notes</span>
				<span class='text'>This campaign is commemorated by his continued appearance on the front of all notes issued by the [[Bank of Scotland]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The image on the 2007 series of banknotes is based on the portrait by [[Henry Raeburn]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  The effect was not always as intended</span>
				<span class='text'>In his 1996 memoirs labor lawyer [[Victor Rabinowitz]] recalled:&lt;blockquote&gt;When I was nine or ten years old, the assigned reading in the class was “[[The Man without a Country]]&quot;, a short story by [[Edward Everett Hale]]</span>
				<span class='text'>At its climax there appeared a poem by Sir Walter Scott, which we were obliged to memorize</span>
				<span class='text'>I can still recite it:&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Breathes there the man with soul so dead,Who never to himself hath said,&quot;This is my own, my native land&quot;?Whose heart hath n’er within him burnedAs home his footsteps he hath turned</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>If such there be, go mark him well</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>he wretch, concentrated all in self,</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>oubly dying shall go downTo the vile dust from whence he sprung,Unwept, unhonor’d, and unsung</span>
				<span class='text'>—&quot;[[The Lay of the Last Minstrel]]&quot; (1805)&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;This poem troubled me a great deal</span>
				<span class='text'>My father never intended to return to his native land [of Lithuania]</span>
				<span class='text'>I didn’t know exactly what a “dead soul” was, but</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> was sure my father didn’t have one</span>
				<span class='text'>The last two lines</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>tated that my father was to go down into the vile dust from which he sprung</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>he poem never caused me to think less of my father, whom I loved and respected, but I quickly grew to despise and, in a sense, fear the thought advanced by the poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>What was all this nonsense about a “native land”? Why was it better than any other land? And why should I have to memorize such a nasty verse</span>
				<span class='text'>So I pondered at the age of ten</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Victor Rabinowitz, ''Unrepentant Leftist: A Lawyer’s Memoir'' (Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1996), ISBN 978-0-252-02253-1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Scott's ''Ivanhoe'' continued to be required reading for many American high school students until the end of the 1950s</span>
				<span class='text'>==References to Scott in literature by other authors===In [[Charles Baudelaire]]'s ''[[La Fanfarlo]]'' (1847), poet Samuel Cramer says of Scott:{{quote|Oh that tedious author, a dusty exhumer of chronicles! A fastidious mass of descriptions of bric-a-brac&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>and castoff things of every sort, armor, tableware, furniture, gothic inns, and melodramatic castles where lifeless mannequins stalk about, dressed in leotards</span>
				<span class='text'>}In the novella, however, Cramer proves as deluded a romantic as any hero in one of Scott's novels</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See Francis S</span>
				<span class='text'>Heck, “Baudelaire's La Fanfarlo: An Example of Romantic Irony”, ''The French Review'' 49: 3 (1976): 328–36</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In [[Anne Brontë]]'s ''[[The Tenant of Wildfell Hall]]'' (1848) the narrator, Gilbert Markham, brings an elegantly bound copy of ''[[Marmion (poem)|Marmion]]'' as a present to the independent &quot;tenant of Wildfell Hall&quot; (Helen Graham) whom he is courting, and is mortified when she insists on paying for it</span>
				<span class='text'>n a speech delivered at Salem, Massachusetts, on January 6, 1860, to raise money for the families of the executed abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] and his followers, [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] calls Brown an example of true chivalry, which consists not in noble birth but in helping the weak and defenseless and declares that  &quot;Walter Scott would have delighted to draw his picture and trace his adventurous career&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt;In his 1870 memoir, ''Army Life in a Black Regiment'', New England abolitionist [[Thomas Wentworth Higginson]] (later editor of [[Emily Dickinson]]), described how he wrote down and preserved Negro spirituals or &quot;shouts&quot; while serving an a colonel in the [[First South Carolina Volunteers]], the first authorized Union Army regiment recruited from freedmen during the Civil War (memorialized in the 1989 film [[Glory (1989 film)|''Glory'']])</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote that he was &quot;a faithful student of the Scottish ballads, and had always envied Sir Walter the delight of tracing them out amid their own heather, and of writing them down piecemeal from the lips of aged crones&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to his daughter [[Eleanor Marx|Eleanor]], Scott was &quot;an author to whom [[Karl Marx]] again and again returned, whom he admired and knew as well as he did Balzac and Fielding&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In his 1883 ''[[Life on the Mississippi]]'', [[Mark Twain]] satirized the impact of Scott's writings, declaring (with humorous hyperbole) that Scott &quot;had so large a hand in making Southern character, as it existed before the [[American Civil War| [American Civil] war]]&quot;, that he is &quot;in great measure responsible for the war&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Twain also targeted Scott in ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'', where he names a sinking boat the &quot;Walter Scott&quot; (1884); and, in ''[[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]]'' (1889), the main character repeatedly utters &quot;great Scott&quot; as an oath; by the end of the book, however, he has become absorbed in the world of knights in armor, reflecting Twain's ambivalence on the topic</span>
				<span class='text'>he idyllic Cape Cod retreat of suffragists Verena Tarrant  and Olive Chancellor in Henry James' ''[[The Bostonians]]'' (1886) is called Marmion, evoking what James considered the Quixotic idealism of these social reformers</span>
				<span class='text'>n ''[[To the Lighthouse]]'' by [[Virginia Woolf]], Mrs</span>
				<span class='text'>Ramsey glances at her husband:{{quote|He was reading something that moved him very much&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>He was tossing the pages over</span>
				<span class='text'>He was acting it – perhaps he was thinking himself the person in the book</span>
				<span class='text'>She wondered what book it was</span>
				<span class='text'>Oh, it was one of old Sir Walter’s she saw, adjusting the shade of her lamp so that the light fell on her knitting</span>
				<span class='text'>For Charles Tansley had been saying (she looked up as if she expected to hear the crash of books on the floor above) that people don’t read Scott any more</span>
				<span class='text'>Then her husband thought, “That’s what they’ll say of me;” so he went and got one of those books&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>[Scott's] feeling for straight forward simple things, these fishermen, the poor old crazed creature in Mucklebackit’s cottage [in ''[[The Antiquary]]''] made him feel so vigorous, so relieved of something that he felt roused and triumphant and could not choke back his tears&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>It fortified him</span>
				<span class='text'>He clean forgot all the little rubs and digs of the evening&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>and his being so irritable with his wife and so touchy and minding when they passed his books over as if they didn’t exist at all</span>
				<span class='text'>Raising the book a little to hide his face, he let them fall and shook his head from side to side and forgot himself completely (but not one or two reflections about morality and French novels and English novels and Scott’s hands being tied but his view perhaps being as true as the other view), forgot his own bothers and failures completely in poor Steenie’s drowning and Mucklebackit’s sorrow (that was Scott at his best) and the astonishing delight and feeling of vigor that it gave him</span>
				<span class='text'>Well, let them improve upon that, he thought as he finished the chapter&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>The whole of life did not consist in going to bed with a woman, he thought, returning to Scott and Balzac, to the English novel and the French novel</span>
				<span class='text'>}In 1951, science-fiction author [[Isaac Asimov]] wrote ''[[Breeds There a Man</span>
				<span class='text'></span>

				<span class='text'>n ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'' (1960), the protagonist's brother is made to read Walter Scott's book ''[[Ivanhoe]]'' to the ailing Mrs</span>
				<span class='text'>Henry Lafayette Dubose, and he refers to the author as &quot;Sir Walter Scout&quot;, in reference to his own sister's nickname</span>
