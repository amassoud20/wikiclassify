				<span class='text'>His mother divorced Nero and married [[Augustus|Octavian]], later known as Augustus, in 39 BC, making him a [[step-son]] of Octavian</span>

				<span class='text'>The subsequent emperors after Tiberius would continue this blended dynasty of both families for the following thirty years; historians have named it the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In relations to the other emperors of this dynasty, Tiberius was the stepson of [[Augustus]], grand-uncle of [[Caligula]], paternal uncle of [[Claudius]], and great-grand uncle of [[Nero]]</span>

				<span class='text'>tml#6 6]&lt;/ref&gt; In 29&amp;nbsp;BC, both he and his brother Drusus rode in the triumphal chariot along with their adoptive father Octavian in celebration of the [[Battle of Actium|defeat of Antony and Cleopatra at Actium]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-tiberius-6&quot; /&gt;In 23&amp;nbsp;BC Emperor Augustus became gravely ill and his possible death threatened to plunge the Roman world into chaos again</span>
				<span class='text'>Historians generally agree that it is during this time that the question of Augustus' heir became most acute, and while Augustus had seemed to indicate that [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] and [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus (Julio-Claudian dynasty)|Marcellus]] would carry on his position in the event of his death, the ambiguity of succession became Augustus' chief problem</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[#Southern|Southern]], pp</span>
				<span class='text'>119‚Äì120</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In response, a series of potential heirs seem to have been selected, among them Tiberius and his brother Drusus</span>
				<span class='text'>In 24&amp;nbsp;BC at the age of seventeen Tiberius entered politics under Augustus' direction, receiving the position of [[quaestor]],&lt;ref name=&quot;paterculus-roman-history-ii-94&quot;&gt;Velleius Paterculus, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope</span>

				<span class='text'>tml#8 8]&lt;/ref&gt; and it is presumably here that his interest in Greek [[rhetoric]] began</span>
				<span class='text'>In 20&amp;nbsp;BC, Tiberius was sent East under [[Marcus Agrippa]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[#Levick|Levick]], p</span>
				<span class='text'>24</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The [[Parthians]] had captured the standards of the [[Roman legion|legions]] under the command of [[Marcus Crassus|Marcus Licinius Crassus]] (53&amp;nbsp;BC) (at the [[Battle of Carrhae]]), Decidius Saxa (40&amp;nbsp;BC), and [[Marc Antony]] (36&amp;nbsp;BC)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-tiberius-9&quot; /&gt;After a year of negotiation, Tiberius led a sizable force into [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]], presumably with the goal of establishing it as a Roman client-state and ending the threat it posed on the Roman-Parthian border</span>
				<span class='text'>Augustus was able to reach a compromise whereby the standards were returned, and Armenia remained a neutral territory between the two powers</span>

				<span class='text'>While Drusus focused his forces in [[Gallia Narbonensis]] and along the German frontier, Tiberius combated the tribes in the [[Alps]] and within [[Transalpine Gaul]], [[Conquest of the Alps|conquering Raetia]]</span>

				<span class='text'>At Augustus‚Äô request in 11 BC, Tiberius divorced Vipsania and married [[Julia the Elder]], Augustus' daughter and Agrippa's widow</span>

				<span class='text'>20</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Tiberius continued to be elevated by Augustus, and after Agrippa's death and his brother Drusus' death in 9&amp;nbsp;BC, seemed the clear candidate for succession</span>
				<span class='text'>As such, in 12&amp;nbsp;BC he received military commissions in [[Pannonia]] and [[Germania]]; both areas highly volatile and of key importance to Augustan policy</span>

				<span class='text'>Setting out northwest from [[Carnuntum]] on the Danube with four legions, Tiberius passed through [[Quadi]] territory in order to invade the Marcomanni from the east</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|250px|Remnants of Tiberius' villa at [[Sperlonga]], on the coast midway between Rome and Naples]]In 6&amp;nbsp;BC, on the verge of accepting command in the East and becoming the second most powerful man in Rome, Tiberius suddenly announced his withdrawal from politics and retired to [[Rhodes]]</span>

				<span class='text'>23‚Äî24</span>

				<span class='text'>tml#10 10]&lt;/ref&gt; Historians have speculated a connection with the fact that Augustus had adopted Julia's sons by Agrippa [[Gaius Caesar|Gaius]] and [[Lucius Caesar|Lucius]], and seemed to be moving them along the same political path that both Tiberius and Drusus had trodden</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[#Levick|Levick]], pp</span>
				<span class='text'>29</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Tiberius's move thus seemed to be an interim solution: he would hold power only until his stepsons would come of age, and then be swept aside</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;cassius-dio-rhistory-lv-9&quot; /&gt; Indeed, [[Tacitus]] calls it Tiberius' ''intima causa'', his innermost reason for departing for Rhodes, and seems to ascribe the entire move to a hatred of Julia and a longing for Vipsania</span>

				<span class='text'>3]]&lt;/ref&gt; Tiberius had found himself married to a woman he loathed, who publicly humiliated him with nighttime escapades in the Forum, and forbidden to see the woman he had loved</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=sag26 /&gt;Whatever Tiberius's motives, the withdrawal was almost disastrous for Augustus's succession plans</span>
				<span class='text'>Gaius and Lucius were still in their early teens, and Augustus, now 57 years old, had no immediate successor</span>
				<span class='text'>There was no longer a guarantee of a peaceful transfer of power after Augustus's death, nor a guarantee that his family, and therefore his family's allies, would continue to hold power should the position of ''[[princeps]]'' survive</span>

				<span class='text'>26</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Somewhat apocryphal stories tell of Augustus pleading with Tiberius to stay, even going so far as to stage a serious illness</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;sag26&quot; /&gt; Tiberius's response was to anchor off the shore of [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]] until word came that Augustus had survived, then sailing straightway for Rhodes</span>

				<span class='text'>28</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;=== Heir to Augustus ===With Tiberius's departure, succession rested solely on Augustus' two young grandsons, Lucius and Gaius Caesar</span>
				<span class='text'>The situation became more precarious in AD&amp;nbsp;2 with the death of Lucius</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;cassiusdio-lix-1&quot; /&gt; &lt;!--It could be argued that Tiberius‚Äôs downfall was not his abuse of power but his refusal to use it</span>
				<span class='text'>His withdrawn nature, especially in comparison with Augustus's openness, immediately made him a disliked figure</span>
				<span class='text'>The Senate had been functioning under the directorship of the Principate for almost 50 years; most Senators had gained their position and hoped to advance further by courting Imperial favor</span>
				<span class='text'>Tiberius's attempt to restore some share of administration to the Senate thus met with failure; the Senate no longer knew how to rule independent of the Princeps</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite his excellence as a military commander and his long experience in affairs of state, Tiberius seemed uninterested in the role of Emperor, and his rule and his reputation suffered</span>
				<span class='text'>The administration of the Imperial sector of the government increased during this time, but how much this is due to direct action by Tiberius rather than his freedmen advisers cannot be determined</span>
				<span class='text'>In the end, Tiberius perhaps is a model of how power can be abused by its lack of use</span>
				<span class='text'>-&gt;Tiberius' heir Caligula not only spent Tiberius' fortune of 2,700,000,000 [[sesterces]] but would also begin the chain of events which would bring about the downfall of the Julio-Claudian dynasty in &lt;small&gt;AD&lt;/small&gt; 68</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Caligula would kill [[Tiberius Gemellus]] and [[Antonia Minor]] before being killed by his own personal guard</span>
				<span class='text'>Tiberius' nephew [[Claudius]] succeeded Caligula and executed Caligula's sister [[Livilla (sister of Caligula)|Julia Livilla]] and in turn would be murdered by Livilla's sister [[Agrippina the Younger]] after they married and her son was of an age to become emperor</span>
				<span class='text'>Agrippina would be executed by her son [[Nero]], who would later commit suicide in 68 AD with no heirs to succeed him</span>

				<span class='text'>tml#61 61]&lt;/ref&gt;==== Publius Cornelius Tacitus ===={{See also|Tacitus}}The most detailed account of this period is handed down to us by [[Tacitus]], whose ''[[Annals]]'' dedicate the first six books entirely to the reign of Tiberius</span>
				<span class='text'>Tacitus was a Roman senator, born during the reign of [[Nero]] in 56 AD, and consul suffect in AD 97</span>
				<span class='text'>His text is largely based on the ''[[acta senatus]]'' (the minutes of the session of the Senate) and the ''[[acta diurna populi Romani]]'' (a collection of the acts of the government and news of the court and capital), as well as speeches by Tiberius himself, and the histories of contemporaries such as [[Cluvius Rufus]], [[Fabius Rusticus]] and [[Pliny the Elder]] (all of which are lost)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-annals-iv-6&quot; /&gt;Tacitus' narrative emphasizes both political and psychological motivation</span>
				<span class='text'>The characterisation of Tiberius throughout the first six books is mostly negative, and gradually worsens as his rule declines, identifying a clear breaking point with the death of [[Drusus]] in 23 AD</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-annals-iv-6&quot; /&gt;The rule of Julio-Claudians is generally described as unjust and 'criminal' by Tacitus</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'', [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#6|I</span>
				<span class='text'>]]&lt;/ref&gt; Even at the outset of his reign, he seems to ascribe many of Tiberius' virtues merely to hypocrisy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-annals-vi-51&quot; /&gt;Another major recurring theme concerns the balance of power between the Senate and the Emperors, [[political corruption|corruption]], and the growing [[tyranny]] among the governing classes of Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>A substantial amount of his account on Tiberius is therefore devoted to the treason trials and persecutions following the revival of the ''maiestas'' law under Augustus</span>

				<span class='text'>9‚Äì51]], [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 3#66|III</span>
				<span class='text'>6‚Äì69]]&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, Tacitus' opinion on Tiberius is best illustrated by his conclusion of the sixth book:{{quote|His character too had its distinct periods</span>
				<span class='text'>It was a bright time in his life and reputation, while under Augustus he was a private citizen or held high offices; a time of reserve and crafty assumption of virtue, as long as Germanicus and Drusus were alive</span>
				<span class='text'>Again, while his mother lived, he was a compound of good and evil; he was infamous for his cruelty, though he veiled his debaucheries, while he loved or feared Sejanus</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally, he plunged into every wickedness and disgrace, when fear and shame being cast off, he simply indulged his own inclinations</span>
