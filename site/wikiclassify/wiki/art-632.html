				<span class='text'>Born in [[Saint-Cloud]], [[Hauts-de-Seine]], he dominated the sport in the late 1960s</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a triple Olympic champion, winning the three alpine events at the [[Alpine skiing at the 1968 Winter Olympics|1968 Winter Olympics]], becoming the most successful athlete there</span>
				<span class='text'>He also won the first two [[FIS Alpine Ski World Cup|World Cup]] titles, in [[1967 Alpine Skiing World Cup|1967]] and [[1968 Alpine Skiing World Cup|1968]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Early life==Killy was born in [[Saint-Cloud]], a suburb of [[Paris, France|Paris]], during the [[Nazi]] occupation of [[World War II]], but was brought up in [[Val-d'Isère]] in the [[Alps]], where his family had relocated in 1945 following the war</span>
				<span class='text'>His father, Robert, was a former [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] [[Fighter pilot|pilot]] for the [[Free French]], and opened a ski shop in the [[Savoie]] village, and would later operate a hotel</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1950, his mother Madeline abandoned the family for another man, leaving Robert to raise Jean-Claude, age 7, his older sister (France), and their infant brother (Mic)</span>
				<span class='text'>Jean-Claude was sent to boarding school in Chambéry, {{convert|80|mi|km|-1}} down the valley, but he despised being shut up in a classroom</span>

				<span class='text'>His father allowed him to drop out at age 15, and he made the French national junior team a year later</span>
				<span class='text'>As a young racer, Killy was fast, but did not usually complete his races, and the early 1960s were not entirely successful for him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=si1990/&gt;In December 1961, at age 18, Killy won his first international race, a giant slalom</span>
				<span class='text'>The event took place in his home village of Val-d'Isere</span>
				<span class='text'>Killy had started 39th, a position that should have been a severe disadvantage</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=si1990/&gt;The French coach picked Killy for the [[Giant Slalom skiing|giant slalom]] in the [[FIS Alpine World Ski Championships 1962|1962 World Championships]] in [[Chamonix]], France, 50 miles (80&amp;nbsp;km) away in the shadow of [[Mont Blanc]]</span>
				<span class='text'>But Killy, unaware of his selection, was still attempting to qualify for the [[downhill]] event in northeastern [[Italy]] at [[Cortina d'Ampezzo]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Only three weeks before the world championships, he skied in his typical reckless style</span>
				<span class='text'>About two hundred yards (180 m) from the finish, Killy hit a stretch of ice in a compression and went down, rose immediately, then crossed the finish on just one ski—and the fastest time</span>
				<span class='text'>Unfortunately, his other leg was broken, and he watched the [[FIS Alpine World Ski Championships|1962 World Championships]] on crutches</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=si1990/&gt;Two years later, at age 20, Killy was entered in all three of the men's events at the [[Alpine skiing at the 1964 Winter Olympics|1964 Olympics]], because his coach wanted to prepare him for [[Alpine skiing at the 1968 Winter Olympics|1968]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Unfortunately, Killy was plagued by recurrences of amoebic [[dysentery]] and [[hepatitis]], ailments that he had contracted in 1962 during a summer of compulsory service with the [[French Army]] in [[Algeria]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His form was definitely off, and he fell a few yards after the start of the downhill, lost a binding in the slalom, and finished fifth in the giant slalom, in which he had been the heavy favorite</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=si1990/&gt; Yet a few weeks later, he dominated a giant slalom race at Garmisch-Partenkirchen, in Bavaria, counting for the prestigious Arlberg-Kandahar events, the oldest 'Classic' in the sport</span>
				<span class='text'>A year later, he also triumphed at another major competition, the slalom of the Hahnenkamm races at Kitzbühel that he clinched three times in a row until 1967</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough the first half of the decade was a relative disappointment, Killy began to strongly improve his results afterwards to become one of the best technical ski racers</span>
				<span class='text'>In August 1966, the Frenchman, nicknamed 'Toutoune' by some of his colleagues and friends, scored his first win in a [[Downhill skiing|downhill]] race against an international field at the [[FIS Alpine World Ski Championships 1966|1966 World Championships]] in [[Portillo, Chile|Portillo]], [[Chile]], and also took gold in the [[Alpine skiing combined|combined]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Killy was peaking as the first [[FIS Alpine Ski World Cup|World Cup]] season was launched in January [[1967 Alpine Skiing World Cup|1967]], with the [[Alpine skiing at the 1968 Winter Olympics|1968 Winter Olympics]] in France only a year away</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/small&gt;Killy was the first [[FIS Alpine Ski World Cup|World Cup]] champion in [[1967 Alpine Skiing World Cup|1967]], winning 12 of 17 races to easily take the overall title</span>
				<span class='text'>He also won the season standings in each of the three &quot;Classic&quot; alpine disciplines; he won all five of the downhill races and four of the five giant slalom races</span>
				<span class='text'>he following year, Killy won the [[Triple Crown of Alpine Skiing]] with a sweep of all three Olympic gold medals ([[Downhill skiing|downhill]], [[Giant Slalom skiing|giant slalom]], and [[Slalom skiing|slalom]]) [[Olympic Games scandals and controversies#1968 Winter Olympics|in controversial circumstances]] at the [[Alpine skiing at the 1968 Winter Olympics|1968 Winter Olympics]] in [[Grenoble]], France</span>
				<span class='text'>By finishing first in all races, he also captured the FIS [[Alpine World Ski Championships|world championship]] title in the [[Alpine skiing combined|combined]] event</span>
				<span class='text'>illy wasn't just faster than the other skiers, he was smarter</span>
				<span class='text'>Electrical timing by Omega was accurate to one-hundredth of a second</span>
				<span class='text'>The starting official counted aloud, &quot;3-2-1-Go&quot; and the skier's boot moved forward to push a pivoting rod aside and start the timer</span>
				<span class='text'>Everyone knew that the closer they got to the bar, the less distance they would travel</span>
				<span class='text'>Killy, however, relied on enormous upper-body strength and outwitted his opponents</span>
				<span class='text'>Rather than crowd as close as possible to the bar, Killy knew that he was allowed a 6-second window to push it aside</span>
				<span class='text'>When the official began counting, he could trip the lever any time he chose from the beginning of the &quot;3-&quot; call and up to 3 seconds after the &quot;Go&quot; signal</span>
				<span class='text'>Therefore, he rose backward, raised his body completely off the ground with his arms and poles, pulled his feet backwards, and propelled himself forward</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead of beginning from a standing start right at the bar, as everyone else did, he hit the bar while already moving forward, giving himself a slight edge</span>
				<span class='text'>This spectacular start certainly helped him to beat his teammate Guy Perillat by a few hundredths in the Olympic downhill despite ruining the wax covering the base of his skis moving over a plate of icy snow an hour prior to his start</span>
				<span class='text'>ith the Olympic events included (for the only time) in the World Cup standings, Killy easily defended his title in [[1968 Alpine Skiing World Cup|1968]] as the overall champion, placing first in the giant slalom and second in the downhill and slalom season standings</span>
				<span class='text'>He retired following the 1968 season, and moved to [[Geneva]], Switzerland, in 1969</span>
