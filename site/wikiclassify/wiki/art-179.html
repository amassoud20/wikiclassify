				<span class='text'>A [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democrat]], he won a record four [[United States presidential election|presidential elections]] and dominated his party for many years as a central figure in world events during the mid-20th century, leading the United States during a time of [[Great Depression|worldwide economic depression]] and [[World War II|total war]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His program for relief, recovery and reform, known as the [[New Deal]], involved a great expansion of the role of the federal government in the economy</span>
				<span class='text'>As a dominant leader of the Democratic Party, he built the [[New Deal Coalition]] that brought together and united labor unions, big city machines, white ethnics, African Americans, and rural white Southerners in support of the party</span>
				<span class='text'>The Coalition significantly realigned American politics after 1932, creating the [[Fifth Party System]] and defining [[Modern liberalism in the United States|American liberalism]] throughout the middle third of the 20th century</span>
				<span class='text'>oosevelt was born in 1882, to [[Roosevelt family|an old, prominent Dutch family from Dutchess County, New York]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He attended the elite educational institutions of [[Groton School]] and [[Harvard College]]</span>
				<span class='text'>At age 23, in 1905, he married [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], with whom he had six children</span>
				<span class='text'>He entered politics in 1910, serving in the [[New York State Senate]], and then as [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]] under President [[Woodrow Wilson]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1920, Roosevelt ran for vice president with presidential candidate [[James M</span>
				<span class='text'>Cox]], but the [[United States presidential election, 1920|Cox/Roosevelt ticket lost]] to the Republican ticket of [[Warren Harding]] and [[Calvin Coolidge]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Roosevelt was [[Franklin D</span>
				<span class='text'>Roosevelt's paralytic illness|stricken with debilitating polio]] in 1921, which cost him the use of his legs and put his future political career in jeopardy, but he attempted to recover from the illness, and founded the [[Warm Springs Historic District|treatment center]] for people with polio in [[Warm Springs, Georgia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After returning to political life by placing [[Alfred E</span>
				<span class='text'>Smith]]'s name into nomination at the [[1924 Democratic National Convention]], Roosevelt, at Smith's behest, successfully ran for Governor of New York in 1928</span>
				<span class='text'>In office from 1929 to 1932, he served as a reform governor promoting the enactment of programs to combat the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] besetting the United States at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1932, in the depths of the Great Depression, Roosevelt successfully defeated incumbent Republican president [[Herbert Hoover]] to win the [[United States presidential election, 1932|presidency of the United States]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Having been energized by his personal victory over his [[polio]], FDR relied on his persistent optimism and activism to renew the national spirit</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[#Siracusa|Siracusa]], p</span>
				<span class='text'>22</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In [[First 100 days of Franklin D</span>
				<span class='text'>Roosevelt's presidency|his first hundred days]] in office, which began March&amp;nbsp;4, 1933, Roosevelt spearheaded unprecedented major legislation and issued a profusion of executive orders that instituted the New Deal—a variety of programs designed to produce relief (government jobs for the unemployed), recovery (economic growth), and reform (through regulation of Wall Street, banks and transportation)</span>
				<span class='text'>He created numerous programs to support the unemployed and farmers, and to encourage labor union growth while more closely regulating business and high finance</span>
				<span class='text'>The repeal of [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] in 1933 added to his popularity, helping him win re-election by a landslide in 1936</span>
				<span class='text'>The economy improved rapidly from 1933 to 1937, but then relapsed into a deep recession in 1937–38</span>
				<span class='text'>The bipartisan [[Conservative Coalition]] that formed in 1937 prevented his [[Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937|packing the Supreme Court]], and blocked almost all proposals for major liberal legislation (except the minimum wage, which did pass)</span>
				<span class='text'>When the war began and unemployment ended, conservatives in Congress repealed the two major relief programs, the WPA and CCC</span>
				<span class='text'>However, they kept most of the regulations on business</span>
				<span class='text'>Along with several smaller programs, major surviving programs include the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]], the Wagner Act, the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] and [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]]</span>
				<span class='text'>s World War II loomed after 1938, with the Japanese invasion of China and the aggression of Nazi Germany, Roosevelt gave strong diplomatic and financial support to China and the United Kingdom, while remaining officially neutral</span>
				<span class='text'>His goal was to make America the &quot;[[Arsenal of Democracy]]&quot;, which would supply munitions to the Allies</span>
				<span class='text'>In March&amp;nbsp;1941, Roosevelt, with Congressional approval, provided [[Lend-Lease]] aid to Britain and China</span>
				<span class='text'>Following the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December&amp;nbsp;7, 1941, which he called &quot;[[Infamy Speech|a date which will live in infamy]]&quot;, Roosevelt sought and obtained the quick approval, on December 8, of the United States Congress to declare war on Japan and, a few days later, on Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>Assisted by his top aide [[Harry Hopkins]], and with very strong national support, he worked closely with British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] and Chinese Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-Shek]] in leading the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] against [[Nazi Germany]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Fascist Italy]] and [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]] in [[World War II]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He supervised the mobilization of the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>economy to support the war effort, and also ordered the [[Japanese American internment|internment]] of 100,000 [[Japanese American]] civilians</span>
				<span class='text'>As an active military leader, Roosevelt implemented a war strategy on two fronts that ended in the defeat of the [[Axis Powers]] and the development of the world's first [[nuclear bomb]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His work also influenced the later creation of the [[United Nations]] and [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods]]</span>
				<span class='text'>During the war, unemployment dropped to 2%, relief programs largely ended, and the industrial economy grew rapidly to new heights as millions of people moved to wartime factory jobs or entered military service</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Roosevelt's health seriously declined during the war years, and he died three months into his fourth term</span>

				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Burns | 1956 | p = 34}}Taking his seat on January&amp;nbsp;1, 1911, Roosevelt immediately became the leader of a group of &quot;Insurgents&quot; who opposed the [[bossism]] of the [[Tammany Hall|Tammany]] [[Political machine|machine]] dominating the state Democratic Party</span>

				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Burns | 1956 | p = 40}}{{Sfn | Gunther | 1950 | pp = 203–5}} Roosevelt soon became a popular figure among New York Democrats, though he had not as yet become an eloquent speaker</span>
