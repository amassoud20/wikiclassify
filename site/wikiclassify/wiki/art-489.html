				<span class='text'>The name &quot;Khurram&quot; was chosen for the young prince by his grandfather, [[Akbar|Emperor Akbar]], with whom the young prince shared a close relationship</span>

				<span class='text'>Given the politically uncertain times immediately preceding Akbar's death, Khurram was in a fair amount of physical danger of harm by political opponents of his father and his conduct at this time can be understood to be a precursor bravery that he would later be known for</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=March 2015}}In 1605, his father succeeded to the throne, after crushing a rebellion by [[Khusrau Mirza|Prince Khausrau]] – Khurram remained distant from the court politics and intrigues in the immediate aftermath of that event, which was apparently a conscious decision on [[Jahangir|Jahangir's]] part</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1614, commanding an army numbering around 200,000, Khurram began the offensive against the Rajput kingdom</span>
				<span class='text'>After a year of the harsh [[war of attrition]], Maharana Amar Singh II surrendered to the Mughal forces with the condition that Ruler of Mewar is not required to attend Mughal Durbar and became a [[vassal state]] of the Mughal Empire</span>

				<span class='text'>His successes in these conflicts led to Jahangir granting him the title of '''Shah Jahan''' ({{lang-fa|King of the World}}) and raised his military rank and allowed him a special throne in his [[Durbar (court)|Durbar]], an unprecedented honour for a prince, thus further solidifying his status as crown prince</span>

				<span class='text'>]Inheritance of power and wealth in the Mughal empire was not determined through [[primogeniture]], but by princely sons competing to achieve military successes and consolidating their power at court</span>
				<span class='text'>This often led to rebellions and wars of succession</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, a complex political climate surrounded the Mughal court in Khurram's formative years</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1611 his father married Nur Jahan, the widowed daughter of an Persian noble</span>

				<span class='text'>ourt intrigues, however, including Nur Jahan's decision to have her daughter from her first marriage wed Prince Khurram's youngest brother [[Shahryar (Mughal prince)|Shahzada Shahryar]] and her support for his claim to the throne led to much internal division</span>

				<span class='text'>She ordered Prince Khurram to march for Kandahar, but he refused</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nath|1990|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=December 2015}} Prince Khurram feared that in his absence Nur Jahan would attempt to poison his father against him and convince Jahangir to name Shahryar the heir in his place</span>
				<span class='text'>This fear brought Prince Khurram to rebel against his father rather than fight against the Persians</span>
