				<span class='text'>Robert's owner ([[Charles Catton the younger|Charles Catton, Jr</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Freedom=={{Slavery}}The state of New York began, in 1799, to legislate the abolition of slavery, although the process of emancipating New York slaves was not complete until July 4, 1827</span>
				<span class='text'>Dumont had promised to grant Truth her freedom a year before the state emancipation, &quot;if she would do well and be faithful</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; However, he changed his mind, claiming a hand injury had made her less productive</span>
				<span class='text'>She was infuriated but continued working, spinning 100 pounds of wool, to satisfy her sense of obligation to him</span>
				<span class='text'>ate in 1826, Truth escaped to freedom with her infant daughter, Sophia</span>
				<span class='text'>She had to leave her other children behind because they were not legally freed in the emancipation order until they had served as bound servants into their twenties</span>

				<span class='text'>Isaac offered to buy her services for the remainder of the year (until the state's emancipation took effect), which Dumont accepted for $20</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;WiH&quot;/&gt; She lived there until the New York State Emancipation Act was approved a year later</span>
				<span class='text'>ruth learned that her son Peter, then five years old, had been sold illegally by Dumont to an owner in Alabama</span>
				<span class='text'>With the help of the Van Wagenens, she took the issue to court and in 1828, after months of legal proceedings, she got back her son, who had been abused by his new owner</span>

				<span class='text'>In it, Truth's speech pattern had characteristics of Southern slaves, and the speech included sentences and phrases that Robinson didn't report</span>
				<span class='text'>Gage's version of the speech became the historic standard, and is known as &quot;Ain't I a Woman?&quot; because that question was repeated four times</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1853, she spoke at a [[Women's suffrage|suffragist]] &quot;mob convention&quot; at the [[Broadway Tabernacle]] in New York City; that year she also met [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Mabee/&gt; Sojourner, like other public speakers, often adapted her speeches to how the audience was responding to her</span>
				<span class='text'>In her speech, Sojourner speaks out for women's rights</span>
				<span class='text'>She incorporates religious references in her speech, particularly the story of [[Esther]]</span>
				<span class='text'>She then goes on to say that, just as women in scripture, women today are fighting for their rights</span>

				<span class='text'>Sojourner was received with loud cheers instead of hisses, now that she had a better-formed reputation established</span>
				<span class='text'>''The Call'' had advertised her name as one of the main convention speakers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Montgomery/&gt; For the first part of her speech, she spoke mainly about the rights of black women</span>
				<span class='text'>Sojourner argued that because the push for equal rights had led to black men winning new rights, now was the best time to give black women the rights they deserve too</span>
				<span class='text'>Throughout her speech she kept stressing that &quot;we should keep things going while things are stirring&quot; and fears that once the fight for colored rights settles down, it would take a long time to warm people back up to the idea of colored women's having equal rights</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Montgomery/&gt;In the second sessions of Sojourner's speech, she utilized a story from the Bible to help strengthen her argument for equal rights for women</span>
				<span class='text'>She ended her argument by accusing men of being self-centered, saying, &quot;man is so selfish that he has got women's rights and his own too, and yet he won't give women their rights</span>
				<span class='text'>He keeps them all to himself</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; For the final session of Sojourner's speech, the center of her attention was mainly on women's right to vote</span>
				<span class='text'>Sojourner told her audience that she owned her own house, as did other women, and must therefore pay taxes</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, they were still unable to vote because they were women</span>
				<span class='text'>Black women who were slaves were made to do hard manual work, such as building roads</span>
				<span class='text'>Sojourner argues that if these women were able to perform such tasks, then they should be allowed to vote because surely voting is easier than building roads</span>

				<span class='text'>She goes on to retell how her masters were not good to her, about how she was whipped for not understanding English, and how she would question God why he had not made her masters be good to her</span>
				<span class='text'>Sojourner admits to the audience that she had once hated white people, but she says once she met her final master, Jesus, she was filled with love for everyone</span>
				<span class='text'>Once slaves were emancipated, she tells the crowd she knew her prayers had been answered</span>
				<span class='text'>hat last part of Sojourner's speech brings in her main focus</span>
				<span class='text'>Some freed slaves were living on government aid at that time, paid for by taxpayers</span>
				<span class='text'>Sojourner announces that this is not any better for those colored people than it is for the members of her audience</span>
