				<span class='text'>Hardy on the Trinity Controversy and Russell's personal life===In 1941, [[G</span>
				<span class='text'>H</span>
				<span class='text'>Hardy]] wrote a 61-page pamphlet titled ''Bertrand Russell and Trinity''—published later as a book by Cambridge University Press with a foreword by [[C</span>
				<span class='text'>D</span>
				<span class='text'>Broad]]—in which he gave an authoritative account about Russell's 1916 dismissal from Trinity College, explaining that a reconciliation between the college and Russell had later taken place and gave details about Russell's personal life</span>
				<span class='text'>Hardy writes that Russell's dismissal had created a scandal since the vast majority of the Fellows of the College opposed the decision</span>
				<span class='text'>The ensuing pressure from the Fellows induced the Council to reinstate Russell</span>
				<span class='text'>In January 1920, it was announced that Russell had accepted the reinstatement offer from Trinity and would begin lecturing from October</span>
				<span class='text'>In July 1920, Russell applied for a one year leave of absence; this was approved</span>
				<span class='text'>He spent the year giving lectures in [[China]] and [[Japan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In January 1921, it was announced by Trinity that Russell had resigned and his resignation had been accepted</span>
				<span class='text'>This resignation, Hardy explains, was completely voluntary and was not the result of another altercation</span>
				<span class='text'>he reason for the resignation, according to Hardy, was that Russell was going through a tumultuous time in his personal life with a divorce and subsequent remarriage</span>
				<span class='text'>Russell contemplated asking Trinity for another one year leave of absence but decided against it, since this would have been an 'unusual application' and the situation had the potential to snowball into another controversy</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Russell did the right thing, in Hardy's opinion, the reputation of the College suffered due to Russell's resignation since the 'world of learning' knew about Russell's altercation with Trinity but not that the rift had healed</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1925, Russell was asked by the Council of Trinity College to give the ''Tarner Lectures'' on the Philosophy of the Sciences; these would later be the basis for one of Russell's best received books according to Hardy: ''The Analysis of Matter'', published in 1927</span>

				<span class='text'>Many understood Russell's comments to mean that Russell approved of a [[first strike]] in a war with the USSR, including [[Nigel Lawson]], who was present when Russell spoke of such matters</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;letters&quot; /&gt;However, just after the atomic bombs exploded over [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]], Russell wrote letters, and published articles in newspapers from 1945 to 1948, stating clearly that it was morally justified and better to go to war against the USSR using atomic bombs while the USA possessed them and before the USSR did</span>
				<span class='text'>After the USSR carried out [[List of nuclear weapons tests of the Soviet Union|its nuclear bomb tests]], Russell changed his position and advocated for the total abolition of atomic weapons</span>

				<span class='text'> He wrote a great many letters to world leaders during this period</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1956, immediately before and during the [[Suez Crisis]], Russell expressed his opposition to what he viewed as European imperialism in the [[Middle East]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He viewed the crisis as another reminder of what he saw as a pressing need for a more effective mechanism for international governance, and to restrict national sovereignty to places such as the [[Suez Canal]] area &quot;where general interest is involved&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time the Suez Crisis was taking place, the world was also captivated by the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] and the subsequent crushing of the revolt by intervening Soviet forces</span>
				<span class='text'>Russell attracted criticism for speaking out fervently against the Suez war while ignoring Soviet repression in Hungary, to which he responded that he did not criticise the Soviets &quot;because there was no need</span>
				<span class='text'>Most of the so-called Western World was fulminating&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he later feigned a lack of concern, at the time he was disgusted by the brutal Soviet response, and on 16 November 1956, he expressed approval for a declaration of support for Hungarian scholars which [[Michael Polanyi]] had cabled to the Soviet embassy in London twelve days previously, shortly after Soviet troops had already entered Budapest</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell'' (Psychology Press, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;In November 1957 Russell wrote an article addressing US President [[Dwight D</span>
				<span class='text'>Eisenhower]] and Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]], urging a summit to consider &quot;the conditions of co-existence&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Khrushchev responded that peace could indeed be served by such a meeting</span>
				<span class='text'>In January 1958 Russell elaborated his views in ''[[The Observer]]'', proposing a cessation of all nuclear-weapons production, with Britain taking the first step by unilaterally suspending its own nuclear-weapons program if necessary, and with Germany &quot;freed from all alien armed forces and pledged to neutrality in any conflict between East and West&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>US Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]] replied for Eisenhower</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=ref1&gt;''Yours Faithfully, Bertrand Russell'' (pp</span>
				<span class='text'>212–213)&lt;/ref&gt;Russell was asked by ''[[The New Republic]]'', a liberal American magazine, to elaborate his views on world peace</span>
				<span class='text'>He suggested that all nuclear-weapons testing and constant flights by planes armed with nuclear weapons be halted immediately, and negotiations be opened for the destruction of all [[Thermonuclear weapon|hydrogen bombs]], with the number of conventional nuclear devices limited to ensure a balance of power</span>
				<span class='text'>He proposed that Germany be reunified and accept the [[Oder-Neisse line]] as its border, and that a neutral zone be established in [[Central Europe]], consisting at the minimum of Germany, [[Poland]], [[Hungary]], and [[Czechoslovakia]], with each of these countries being free of foreign troops and influence, and prohibited from forming alliances with countries outside the zone</span>
				<span class='text'>In the Middle East, Russell suggested that the West avoid opposing [[Arab nationalism]], and proposed the creation of a United Nations peacekeeping force to guard [[Israel]]'s frontiers to ensure that Israel was protected from aggression and prevented from committing it</span>
				<span class='text'>He also suggested Western recognition of the [[China|People's Republic of China]], and that it be admitted to the UN with a permanent seat on the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=ref1/&gt;He was in contact with [[Lionel Rogosin]] while the latter was filming his anti-war film ''[[Good Times, Wonderful Times]]'' in the 1960s</span>
				<span class='text'>He became a hero to many of the youthful members of the [[New Left]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In early 1963, in particular, Russell became increasingly vocal in his disapproval of the [[Vietnam War]], and felt that the US government's policies there were near-[[genocide|genocidal]]</span>
