				<span class='text'>His mother was Florence Augusta Lewis, {{née}} Hamilton (1862–1908), known as Flora, the daughter of a [[Church of Ireland]] (Anglican) priest</span>
				<span class='text'>He had an elder brother, [[Warren Lewis|Warren Hamilton Lewis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>When he was four, his dog Jacksie was killed by a car, and he announced that his name was now Jacksie</span>
				<span class='text'>At first, he would answer to no other name, but later accepted Jack, the name by which he was known to friends and family for the rest of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>When he was seven, his family moved into &quot;Little Lea&quot;, the family home of his childhood, in the [[Strandtown]] area of East Belfast</span>
				<span class='text'>s a boy, Lewis was fascinated with [[anthropomorphic]] animals; he fell in love with [[Beatrix Potter]]'s stories and often wrote and illustrated his own animal stories</span>
				<span class='text'>He and his brother Warnie created the world of [[Boxen (C</span>

				<span class='text'>Lewis loved to read</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/poem&gt;|source=—''[[Surprised by Joy]]''}}Lewis was schooled by private tutors before being sent to the [[Wynyard School]] in [[Watford]], Hertfordshire, in 1908, just after his mother's death from cancer</span>
				<span class='text'>Lewis's brother had enrolled there three years previously</span>
				<span class='text'>The school was closed not long afterwards due to a lack of pupils; the headmaster Robert &quot;Oldie&quot; Capron was soon after committed to a psychiatric hospital</span>
				<span class='text'> Lewis then attended [[Campbell College]] in the east of Belfast about a mile from his home, but he left after a few months due to respiratory problems</span>
				<span class='text'>He was then sent to the health-resort town of [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]], Worcestershire, where he attended the preparatory school Cherbourg House, which Lewis calls &quot;Chartres&quot; in his autobiography</span>
				<span class='text'>It was during this time that Lewis abandoned his childhood Christian faith and became an atheist, becoming interested in mythology and the occult</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lewis|1966b|p=56}} In September 1913, Lewis enrolled at [[Malvern College]], where he remained until the following June</span>
				<span class='text'>He found the school socially competitive</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lewis|1966a|p=107}} After leaving Malvern, he studied privately with [[William T</span>
				<span class='text'>Kirkpatrick]], his father's old tutor and former headmaster of [[Lurgan College]]</span>
				<span class='text'>s a teenager, Lewis was wonder-struck by the songs and legends of what he called ''Northernness'', the ancient literature of Scandinavia preserved in the [[Icelandic sagas]]</span>
				<span class='text'>These legends intensified an inner longing he later called &quot;joy&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He also grew to love nature; its beauty reminded him of the stories of the North, and the stories of the North reminded him of the beauties of nature</span>
				<span class='text'>His teenage writings moved away from the tales of Boxen, and he began using different art forms, including [[epic poetry]] and opera, to try to capture his new-found interest in [[Norse mythology]] and the natural world</span>
				<span class='text'>Studying with Kirkpatrick (&quot;The Great Knock&quot;, as Lewis afterwards called him) instilled in him a love of [[Greek literature]] and mythology and sharpened his debate and reasoning skills</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1916, Lewis was awarded a scholarship at [[University College, Oxford]]</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lewis|1993|p=93}}Various critics have suggested that it was Lewis's dismay over sectarian conflict in his native Belfast which led him to eventually adopt such an ecumenical brand of Christianity</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Wilson|1991|p=xi}}  As one critic has said, Lewis &quot;repeatedly extolled the virtues of all branches of the Christian faith, emphasising a need for unity among Christians around what the Catholic writer {{nowrap|[[G</span>

				<span class='text'>Maureen Moore, Paddy's sister, said that the two made a mutual pact{{sfn|Edwards|2007|p=133}} that if either died during the war, the survivor would take care of both their families</span>
				<span class='text'>Paddy was killed in action in 1918 and Lewis kept his promise</span>
				<span class='text'> Paddy had earlier introduced Lewis to his mother, Jane King Moore, and a friendship quickly sprang up between Lewis, who was eighteen when they met, and Jane, who was forty-five</span>
				<span class='text'>The friendship with Moore was particularly important to Lewis while he was recovering from his wounds in hospital, as his father did not visit him</span>
				<span class='text'>ewis lived with and cared for Moore until she was hospitalised in the late 1940s</span>
				<span class='text'>He routinely introduced her as his mother, and referred to her as such in letters</span>
				<span class='text'>Lewis' own mother had died when he was a child, and his father was distant, demanding, and eccentric, and he developed a deeply affectionate friendship with Moore</span>
				<span class='text'>peculation regarding their relationship re-surfaced with the 1990 publication of [[A</span>
				<span class='text'>N</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilson]]'s biography of Lewis</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilson (who never met Lewis) attempted to make a case for their having been lovers for a time</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilson's biography was not the first to address the question of Lewis's relationship with Moore</span>
				<span class='text'>[[George Sayer]] knew Lewis for 29 years, and he had sought to shed light on the relationship during the period of 14 years prior to Lewis's conversion to Christianity</span>
				<span class='text'>In his biography ''Jack: A Life of C</span>
				<span class='text'>S</span>
				<span class='text'>Lewis'', he wrote:{{quote |Were they lovers? [[Owen Barfield]], who knew Jack well in the 1920s, once said that he thought the likelihood was &quot;fifty-fifty</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Although she was twenty-six years older than Jack, she was still a handsome woman, and he was certainly infatuated with her</span>
				<span class='text'>But it seems very odd, if they were lovers, that he would call her &quot;mother</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; We know, too, that they did not share the same bedroom</span>

				<span class='text'>In addition to Christian themes, Lewis also borrows characters from [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]], as well as traditional British and Irish fairy tales</span>
				<span class='text'>===Other works====Lewis wrote several works on [[Heaven]] and [[Hell]]</span>
				<span class='text'>One of these, ''[[The Great Divorce]]'', is a short novella in which a few residents of Hell take a bus ride to Heaven, where they are met by people who dwell there</span>

				<span class='text'>Lewis's last novel was ''[[Till We Have Faces]]'', which he thought of as his most mature and masterly work of fiction but which was never a popular success</span>
				<span class='text'>It is a retelling of the myth of [[Cupid and Psyche]] from the unusual perspective of Psyche's sister</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;it seems unlikely that he felt as irretrievably crushed as some of his acquaintances have made out; the episode is probably an inflated legend, in the same category as the affair of [[Wittgenstein's Poker]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Certainly Anscombe herself believed that Lewis's argument, though flawed, was getting at something very important; she thought that this came out more in the improved version of it that Lewis presented in a subsequent edition of ''Miracles''&amp;nbsp;– though that version also had 'much to criticize in it'</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;Lewis also wrote an autobiography titled ''Surprised by Joy'', which places special emphasis on his own conversion</span>
				<span class='text'>(It was written before he met his wife, Joy Gresham; the title of the book came from the first line of a poem by [[William Wordsworth]]</span>
				<span class='text'> His essays and public speeches on Christian belief, many of which were collected in ''[[God in the Dock]]'' and ''[[The Weight of Glory and Other Addresses]]'', remain popular today</span>
				<span class='text'>is most famous works, the ''Chronicles of Narnia'', contain many strong Christian messages and are often considered [[allegory]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Lewis, an expert on the subject of allegory, maintained that the books were not allegory, and preferred to call the Christian aspects of them &quot;[[supposition]]al&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>As Lewis wrote in a letter to a Mrs</span>
				<span class='text'>Hook in December 1958:&lt;blockquote&gt;If [[Aslan]] represented the immaterial Deity in the same way in which Giant Despair &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;a character in ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; represents despair, he would be an allegorical figure</span>
				<span class='text'>In reality, he is an invention giving an imaginary answer to the question, 'What might Christ become like, if there really were a world like [[Narnia (world)|Narnia]] and He chose to be incarnate and die and rise again in that world as He actually has done in ours?' This is not allegory at all</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Martindale|Root|1990|pp=}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;====&quot;Trilemma&quot;===={{Main|Lewis's trilemma}}In a much-cited passage from ''Mere Christianity'', Lewis challenged the view that Jesus was a great moral teacher but not God</span>
				<span class='text'>He argued that Jesus made several implicit claims to divinity, which would logically exclude that claim</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;blockquote&gt;I am trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him: 'I'm ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don't accept his claim to be God</span>
				<span class='text'> That is the one thing we must not say</span>
				<span class='text'>A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher</span>
				<span class='text'>He would either be a lunatic&amp;nbsp;– on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg&amp;nbsp;– or else he would be the Devil of Hell</span>
				<span class='text'>You must make your choice</span>
				<span class='text'>Either this man was, and is, the [[Son of God]], or else a madman or something worse</span>
				<span class='text'>You can shut him up for a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God, but let us not come with any patronising nonsense about his being a great human teacher</span>
				<span class='text'>He has not left that open to us</span>
				<span class='text'>He did not intend to</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lewis|1997|p=43}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;Lewis did not invent this argument, but developed and popularized it&amp;nbsp;– although it is sometimes referred to as &quot;[[Lewis's trilemma]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>It has been used by Christian apologist [[Josh McDowell]] in his book ''More Than a Carpenter'' {{Harvard citation|McDowell|2001}}</span>
				<span class='text'>It has been widely repeated in Christian apologetic literature, but largely ignored by professional theologians and biblical scholars</span>

				<span class='text'>om/books?id=hn1gaNlri1cC&amp;pg=PA266 266&quot; /&gt;====Universal morality====One of the main theses in Lewis's apologia is that there is a common morality known throughout humanity</span>
				<span class='text'>In the first five chapters of ''Mere Christianity'' Lewis discusses the idea that people have a standard of behaviour to which they expect people to adhere</span>
				<span class='text'>This standard has been called Universal Morality or [[Natural Law]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Lewis claims that people all over the earth know what this law is and when they break it</span>
				<span class='text'>He goes on to claim that there must be someone or something behind such a universal set of principles</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lindskoog|2001|p=144}}&lt;blockquote&gt;These then are the two points that I wanted to make</span>
				<span class='text'>First, that human beings, all over the earth, have this curious idea that they ought to behave in a certain way, and cannot really get rid of it</span>
				<span class='text'>Secondly, that they do not in fact behave in that way</span>
				<span class='text'>They know the Law of Nature; they break it</span>
				<span class='text'>These two facts are the foundation of all clear thinking about ourselves and the universe we live in</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lewis|1997|p=21}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;Lewis also portrays Universal Morality in his works of fiction</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''The Chronicles of Narnia'' he describes Universal Morality as the &quot;deep magic&quot; which everyone knew</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lindskoog|2001|p=146}}In the second chapter of ''Mere Christianity'' Lewis recognises that &quot;many people find it difficult to understand what this Law of Human Nature&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>is&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>And he responds first to the idea &quot;that the Moral Law is simply our herd instinct&quot; and second to the idea &quot;that the Moral Law is simply a social convention&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>In responding to the second idea Lewis notes that people often complain that one set of moral ideas is better than another, but that this actually argues for there existing some &quot;Real Morality&quot; to which they are comparing other moralities</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally he notes that sometimes differences in moral codes are exaggerated by people who confuse differences in beliefs about morality with differences in beliefs about facts:{{quote |I have met people who exaggerate the differences, because they have not distinguished between differences of morality and differences of belief about facts</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, one man said to me, &quot;Three hundred years ago people in England were putting witches to death</span>
				<span class='text'>Was that what you call the Rule of Human Nature or Right Conduct?&quot; But surely the reason we do not execute witches is that we do not believe there are such things</span>
				<span class='text'>If we did&amp;nbsp;– if we really thought that there were people going about who had sold themselves to the devil and received supernatural powers from him in return and were using these powers to kill their neighbours or drive them mad or bring bad weather, surely we would all agree that if anyone deserved the death penalty, then these filthy [[quisling]]s did</span>
				<span class='text'>There is no difference of moral principle here: the difference is simply about matter of fact</span>
				<span class='text'>It may be a great advance in knowledge not to believe in witches: there is no moral advance in not executing them when you do not think they are there</span>
				<span class='text'>You would not call a man humane for ceasing to set mousetraps if he did so because he believed there were no mice in the house</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lewis|1997|p=26}}}}Lewis also had fairly progressive views on the topic of &quot;animal morality&quot;, in particular the suffering of animals, as is evidenced by several of his essays: most notably, ''On Vivisection''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Irish Anti-Vivisection Society | accessdate =2 August 2009 | url = http://www</span>
