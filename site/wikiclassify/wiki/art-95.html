				<span class='text'>The manuscript was eventually published in 1977 though Lewis scholar  doubts its authenticity</span>
				<span class='text'>The Chronicles of Narnia is a series of seven fantasy novels for children and is considered a classic of childrens literature</span>

				<span class='text'>It has been adapted several times complete or in part for radio television stage and </span>

				<span class='text'>In addition to Christian themes Lewis also borrows characters from  and  as well as traditional British and Irish fairy tales</span>
				<span class='text'>Lewis wrote several works on  and </span>
				<span class='text'>One of these  is a short novella in which a few residents of Hell take a bus ride to Heaven where they are met by people who dwell there</span>

				<span class='text'>This work deliberately echoes two other more famous works with a similar theme the  of  and Bunyans </span>

				<span class='text'>Both were published under the pen name Clive Hamilton</span>

				<span class='text'>Lewis is also regarded by many as one of the most influential  of his time in addition to his career as an English professor and an author of fiction</span>
				<span class='text'> was voted best book of the twentieth century by  in 2000</span>
				<span class='text'> He has been called The Apostle to the Skeptics due to his approach to religious belief as a sceptic and his following conversion</span>

				<span class='text'>Mere Christianity  and  were all concerned to one degree or another with uting popular objections to Christianity such as the question How could a good God allow pain to exist in the world He also became a popular lecturer and broadcaster and some of his writing originated as scripts for radio talks or lectures including much of Mere Christianity</span>

				<span class='text'>Certainly Anscombe herself believed that Lewiss argument though flawed was getting at something very important she thought that this came out more in the improved version of it that Lewis presented in a subsequent edition of Miraclesampnbsp– though that version also had much to criticize in it</span>
				<span class='text'>ewis also wrote an autobiography titled Surprised by Joy which places special emphasis on his own conversion</span>
				<span class='text'>It was written before he met his wife Joy Gresham the title of the book came from the first line of a poem by </span>

				<span class='text'>is most famous works the Chronicles of Narnia contain many strong Christian messages and are often considered </span>
				<span class='text'>Lewis an expert on the subject of allegory maintained that the books were not allegory and perred to call the Christian aspects of them al</span>
				<span class='text'>As Lewis wrote in a letter to a Mrs</span>
				<span class='text'>Hook in December 1958blockquoteIf  represented the immaterial Deity in the same way in which Giant Despair nowiki nowikia character in nowiki nowiki represents despair he would be an allegorical figure</span>
				<span class='text'>In reality he is an invention giving an imaginary answer to the question What might Christ become like if there really were a world like  and He chose to be incarnate and die and rise again in that world as He actually has done in ours This is not allegory at all</span>
				<span class='text'>blockquote In a much cited passage from Mere Christianity Lewis challenged the view that Jesus was a great moral teacher but not God</span>
				<span class='text'>He argued that Jesus made several implicit claims to divinity which would logically exclude that claim</span>
				<span class='text'>lockquoteI am trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him Im ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher but I dont accept his claim to be God</span>
				<span class='text'>That is the one thing we must not say</span>
				<span class='text'>A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher</span>
				<span class='text'>He would either be a lunaticampnbsp– on the level with the man who says he is a poached eggampnbsp– or else he would be the Devil of Hell</span>
				<span class='text'>You must make your choice</span>
				<span class='text'>Either this man was and is the  or else a madman or something worse</span>
				<span class='text'>You can shut him up for a fool you can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God but let us not come with any patronising nonsense about his being a great human teacher</span>
				<span class='text'>He has not left that open to us</span>
				<span class='text'>He did not intend to</span>
				<span class='text'>blockquoteLewis did not invent this argument but developed and popularized itampnbsp– although it is sometimes erred to as </span>
				<span class='text'>It has been used by Christian apologist  in his book More Than a Carpenter </span>
				<span class='text'>It has been widely repeated in Christian apologetic literature but largely ignored by professional theologians and biblical scholars</span>
				<span class='text'>Lewiss Christian apologetics and this argument in particular have been criticised</span>
				<span class='text'>Philosopher John Beversluis described Lewiss arguments as textually careless and theologically unreliable  and this particular argument as logically unsound and an example of </span>
				<span class='text'> Theologian  argues that New Testament scholars do not now support the view that Jesus claimed to be God</span>
				<span class='text'> New Testament scholar  criticises Lewis for failing to recognise the significance of Jesus Jewish identity and settingampnbsp– an oversight which at best drastically short circuits the argument and which lays Lewis open to criticism that his argument doesnt work as history and it backfires dangerously when historical critics question his reading of the gospels although he believes this doesnt undermine the eventual claim</span>
				<span class='text'>Lewis used a similar argument in  when  advises the young heroes that their sisters claims of a magical world must logically be taken as either lies madness or truth</span>

				<span class='text'>oogle</span>
				<span class='text'>om booksid hn1gaNlri1cCamppg PA266 266   One of the main theses in Lewiss apologia is that there is a common morality known throughout humanity</span>
				<span class='text'>In the first five chapters of Mere Christianity Lewis discusses the idea that people have a standard of behaviour to which they expect people to adhere</span>
				<span class='text'>This standard has been called Universal Morality or </span>
				<span class='text'>Lewis claims that people all over the earth know what this law is and when they break it</span>
				<span class='text'>He goes on to claim that there must be someone or something behind such a universal set of principles</span>
				<span class='text'>lockquoteThese then are the two points that I wanted to make</span>
				<span class='text'>First that human beings all over the earth have this curious idea that they ought to behave in a certain way and cannot really get rid of it</span>
				<span class='text'>Secondly that they do not in fact behave in that way</span>
				<span class='text'>They know the Law of Nature they break it</span>
				<span class='text'>These two facts are the foundation of all clear thinking about ourselves and the universe we live in</span>
				<span class='text'>blockquoteLewis also portrays Universal Morality in his works of fiction</span>
				<span class='text'>In The Chronicles of Narnia he describes Universal Morality as the deep magic which everyone knew</span>
				<span class='text'>n the second chapter of Mere Christianity Lewis recognises that many people find it difficult to understand what this Law of Human Natureampnbsp</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>is</span>
				<span class='text'>And he responds first to the idea that the Moral Law is simply our herd instinct and second to the idea that the Moral Law is simply a social convention</span>
				<span class='text'>In responding to the second idea Lewis notes that people often complain that one set of moral ideas is better than another but that this actually argues for there existing some Real Morality to which they are comparing other moralities</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally he notes that sometimes differences in moral codes are exaggerated by people who confuse differences in beliefs about morality with differences in beliefs about factsLewis also had fairly progressive views on the topic of animal morality in particular the suffering of animals as is evidenced by several of his essays most notably On Vivisection  and On the Pains of Animals</span>
