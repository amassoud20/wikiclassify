				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lee|2003|p=3}}Lee's parents separated when he was four and divorced two years later</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lee|2003|p=21}} After enrolling in Miss Fisher's Academy in Territet, he played his first role, as [[Rumpelstiltskin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lee|2003|p=22}} They then returned to London, where Lee attended Wagner's private school in [[Queen's Gate]] and his mother married Harcourt George St-Croix Rose, a banker and uncle of [[Ian Fleming]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lee|2003|p=22-23}} Fleming, author of the [[James Bond]] novels, thus became Lee's step-cousin</span>
				<span class='text'>The family moved to [[Fulham]], living next door to the actor [[Eric Maturin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lee|2003|p=23}} One night, he was introduced to [[Felix Yusupov|Prince Yusupov]] and [[Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia|Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich]], the assassins of [[Grigori Rasputin]], whom Lee was to play many years later</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lee|2003|p=24}}When Lee was nine, he was sent to [[Summer Fields School]], a preparatory school in Oxford whose pupils often later attended [[Eton College|Eton]]</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lee|2003|p=44}} He was a &quot;passable&quot; [[Rackets (sport)|racquets]] player and fencer and a competent cricketer but did not do well at the other sports played: hockey, football, rugby and boxing</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lee|2003|p=45}} He disliked the parades and weapons training and would always &quot;play dead&quot; as soon as possible during mock battles</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lee|2003|p=46-47}} Lee was frequently [[School corporal punishment|beaten]] at school, including once at Wellington for &quot;being beaten too often&quot;, though he accepted them as &quot;logical and therefore acceptable&quot; punishments for knowingly breaking the rules</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lee|2003|p=47}} At age 17 and with one year left at Wellington, the summer term of 1939 was his last</span>
				<span class='text'>His step-father had gone bankrupt, owing £25,000</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lee|2003|p=48}}His mother separated from Rose, and Lee had to get a job, his sister already working as a secretary for the Church of England Pensions Board</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lee|2003|p=50}} With most employers on or preparing to go on summer holidays, there were no immediate opportunities for Lee and so he was sent to the [[French Riviera]], where his sister was on holiday with friends</span>

				<span class='text'>After a fortnight, they returned home</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lee|2003|p=60}} Lee returned to work at [[United States Lines]] and found his work more satisfying, feeling that he was contributing</span>

				<span class='text'>Realising that he had no inclination to follow his father into the Army, Lee decided to join up while he still had some choice of service, and volunteered for the [[Royal Air Force]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lee|2003|p=65}}Lee reported to [[RAF Uxbridge]] for training and was then posted to the Initial Training Wing at [[Paignton]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lee|2003|p=67-68}} After he had passed his exams in Liverpool, the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan]] meant that he travelled on the ''[[MV Reina del Pacifico|Reina del Pacifico]]'' to South Africa, then to his posting at Hillside, at [[Bulawayo]] in [[Southern Rhodesia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lee|2003|p=70-71}} Training with [[de Havilland Tiger Moth]]s, Lee was having his penultimate training session before his first solo flight when he suffered from headaches and blurred vision</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lee|2003|p=72-73}} Lee was devastated and the death of a fellow trainee from Summer Fields only made him more despondent</span>
				<span class='text'>His appeals were fruitless and he was left with nothing to do</span>
