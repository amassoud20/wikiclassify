				<span class='text'>pg|''The Prophet Jeremiah'' (1511)&lt;/gallery&gt;===Figure compositions===Michelangelo's relief of the ''[[Battle of the Centaurs (Michelangelo)|Battle of the Centaurs]]'', created while he was still a youth associated with the Medici Academy, is an unusually complex relief in that it shows a great number of figures involved in a vigorous struggle</span>
				<span class='text'> Such a complex disarray of figures was rare in Florentine art, where it would usually only be found in images showing either the [[Massacre of the Innocents]] or the Torments of Hell</span>
				<span class='text'>The relief treatment, in which some of the figures are boldly projecting, may indicate Michelangelo's familiarity with Roman [[sarcophagus]] reliefs from the collection of Lorenzo Medici, and similar marble panels created by [[Nicola Pisano|Nicola]] and [[Giovanni Pisano]], and with the figurative compositions on [[Ghiberti]]'s [[Florence Baptistery#Lorenzo Ghiberti|Baptistry Doors]]</span>
				<span class='text'>he composition of the ''[[Battle of Cascina]]'', is known in its entirety only from copies, as the original cartoon, according to Vasari, was so admired that it deteriorated and was eventually in pieces</span>
				<span class='text'>It reflects the earlier relief in the energy and diversity of the figures, with many different postures, and many being viewed from the back, as they turn toward the approaching enemy and prepare for battle</span>
				<span class='text'>n ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The Last Judgment]]'' it is said that Michelangelo drew inspiration from a fresco by [[Melozzo da Forli]] in Rome's [[Santi Apostoli]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Melozzo had depicted figures from different angles, as if they were floating in the Heaven and seen from below</span>
				<span class='text'>Melozzo's majestic figure of Christ, with windblown cloak, demonstrates a degree of foreshortening of the figure that had also been employed by [[Andrea Mantegna]], but was not usual in the frescos of Florentine painters</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''The Last Judgement'' Michelangelo had the opportunity to depict, on an unprecedented scale, figures in the action of either rising heavenward or falling and being dragged down</span>
				<span class='text'>n the two frescos of the Pauline Chapel, the ''[[The Crucifixion of St</span>
				<span class='text'>Peter (Michelangelo)|The Crucifixion of St</span>
				<span class='text'>Peter]]'' and the ''[[The Conversion of Saul (Michelangelo)|The Conversion of Saul]]'', Michelangelo has used the various groups of figures to convey a complex narrative</span>
				<span class='text'>In the ''Crucifixion of Peter'' soldiers busy themselves about their assigned duty of digging a post hole and raising the cross while various people look on and discuss the events</span>
				<span class='text'>A group of horrified women cluster in the foreground, while another group of Christians is led by a tall man to witness the events</span>
				<span class='text'>In the right foreground, Michelangelo walks out of the painting with an expression of disillusionment</span>

				<span class='text'>At the same church, Giulio de' Medici (later Pope Clement VII) commissioned him to design the [[Medici Chapel]] and the tombs of Giuliano and Lorenzo Medici</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Goldscheider&lt;/ref&gt;  Pope Clement also commissioned the Laurentian Library, for which Michelangelo also designed the extraordinary vestibule with columns recessed into niches, and a staircase that appears to spill out of the library like a flow of lava, according to Pevsner, ''</span>

				<span class='text'>'&lt;ref&gt;Nikolaus Pevsner, ''An Outline of European Architecture'', Pelican, 1964&lt;/ref&gt;In 1546 Michelangelo produced the highly complex ovoid design for the pavement of the [[Campidoglio]] and began designing an upper storey for the [[Farnese Palace]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1547 he took on the job of completing St Peter's Basilica, begun to a design by [[Bramante]], and with several intermediate designs by several architects</span>
				<span class='text'>Michelangelo returned to Bramante's design, retaining the basic form and concepts by simplifying and strengthening the design to create a more dynamic and unified whole</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Gardner&quot;&gt;Gardner&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the late 16th-century engraving depicts the dome as having a hemispherical profile,  the dome of Michelangelo's model is somewhat ovoid and the final product, as completed by [[Giacomo della Porta]] is more so</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/gallery&gt;===Death===In his old age, Michelangelo created a number of ''Pietàs'' in which he apparently reflects upon mortality</span>
				<span class='text'>They are heralded by the ''Victory'', perhaps created for the tomb of Pope Julius II but left unfinished</span>
				<span class='text'>In this group, the youthful victor overcomes an older hooded figure, with the features of Michelangelo</span>
				<span class='text'>he ''Pietà of Vittoria Colonna'' is a chalk drawing of a type described as &quot;presentation drawings&quot;, as they might be given as a gift by an artist, and were not necessarily studies towards a painted work</span>
				<span class='text'>In this image, Mary's upraise arms and upraised hands are indicative of her prophetic role</span>
				<span class='text'>The frontal aspect is reminiscent of [[Masaccio]]'s fresco of the [[Holy Trinity]] in the [[Basilica of Santa Maria Novella]], Florence</span>
				<span class='text'>n the ''Florentine Pietà'', Michelangelo again depicts himself, this time as the aged [[Nicodemus]] lowering the body of Jesus from the cross into the arms of Mary his mother and Mary Magdalene</span>
				<span class='text'>Michelangelo smashed the left arm and leg of the figure of Jesus</span>
				<span class='text'>His pupil [[Tiberio Calcagni]] repaired the arm and drilled a hole in which to fix a replacement leg</span>
				<span class='text'>He also worked on the figure of Mary Magdalene</span>
				<span class='text'>robably Michelangelo's last sculpture, the ''[[Rondanini Pietà]]'' could never be completed because Michelangelo carved it away until there was insufficient stone</span>
				<span class='text'>The legs and a detached arm remain from a previous stage of the work</span>
				<span class='text'>As it remains, the sculpture has an abstracted quality, in keeping with 20th-century concepts of sculpture</span>

				<span class='text'> Although their names are often cited together, Michelangelo was younger than Leonardo by 23 years, and older than Raphael by eight</span>
				<span class='text'> Because of his reclusive nature, he had little to do with either artist and outlived both of them by more than forty years</span>
				<span class='text'>Michelangelo took few sculpture students</span>
				<span class='text'>He employed [[Francesco Granacci]], who was his fellow pupil at the Medici Academy, and became one of several assistants on the Sistine Chapel ceiling</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Goldscheider12/&gt; Michelangelo appears to have used assistants mainly for the more manual tasks of preparing surfaces and grinding colours</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite this, his works were to have a great influence on painters, sculptors and architects for many generations to come</span>
				<span class='text'>hile Michelangelo's ''David'' is the most famous male nude of all time and destined to be reproduced in order to grace cities around the world, some of his other works have had perhaps even greater impact on the course of art</span>
				<span class='text'>The twisting forms and tensions of the ''Victory'', the ''Bruges Madonna'' and the ''Medici Madonna'' make them the heralds of the [[Mannerism|Mannerist art]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The unfinished giants for the tomb of Pope Julius II had profound effect on late-19th- and 20th-century sculptors such as [[Rodin]] and [[Henry Moore]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ichelangelo's foyer of the Laurentian Library was one of the earliest buildings to utilise Classical forms in a plastic and expressive manner</span>
				<span class='text'> This dynamic quality was later to find its major expression in Michelangelo's centrally planned St Peter's, with its [[giant order]], its rippling cornice and its upward-launching pointed dome</span>
				<span class='text'> The dome of St Peter's was to influence the building of churches for many centuries, including [[Sant'Andrea della Valle]] in Rome and [[St Paul's Cathedral]], London, as well as the civic domes of many public buildings and the state capitals across America</span>
				<span class='text'>rtists who were directly influenced by Michelangelo include Raphael, who imitated Michelangelo's prophets in two of his works, including his depiction of the great master in the [[School of Athens]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Other artists, such as [[Pontormo]], drew on the writhing forms of the ''Last Judgement'' and the frescoes of the Capella Paolina</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=December 2013}}The Sistine Chapel ceiling was a work of unprecedented grandeur, both for its architectonic forms, to be imitated by many Baroque ceiling painters,  and also for the wealth of its inventiveness in the study of figures</span>
