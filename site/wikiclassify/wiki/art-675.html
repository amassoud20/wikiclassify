				<span class='text'>In the 1950s Olivier was an independent actor-manager, but his stage career was in the doldrums until he joined the ''avant garde'' [[English Stage Company]] in 1957 to play the title role in ''[[The Entertainer (play)|The Entertainer]]'', a part he later played [[The Entertainer (film)|on film]]</span>

				<span class='text'>The National Theatre's largest auditorium is named in his honour, and he is commemorated in the [[Laurence Olivier Awards]], given annually by the [[Society of London Theatre]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was married three times, to the actresses [[Jill Esmond]] from 1930 to 1940, [[Vivien Leigh]] from 1940 to 1960, and [[Joan Plowright]] from 1961 until his death</span>
				<span class='text'>=Life and career=====Family background and early life (1907–24)===Olivier was born in [[Dorking]], Surrey, the youngest of the three children of the Revd Gerard Kerr Olivier (1869–1939) and his wife Agnes Louise, ''née'' Crookenden (1871–1920)</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Billington|2004}} Their elder children were Sybille (1901–89) and Gerard Dacres &quot;Dickie&quot; (1904–58)</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Holden|1988|p=12}} His great-great-grandfather was of French [[Huguenot]] descent, and Olivier came from a long line of Protestant clergymen</span>
				<span class='text'>{efn|Gerard's father Henry Arnold Olivier (1826–1912) was a priest who had eight children, his other sons all achieving success in secular spheres: [[Sydney Olivier, 1st Baron Olivier|Sydney]] became [[List of Governors of Jamaica|Governor of Jamaica]] and later [[Secretary of State for India]], [[Herbert Arnould Olivier|Herbert]] was a successful portrait painter, and Henry (1850–1935) had a military career, ending as a [[colonel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Holden|1988|p=11}}}} Gerard Olivier had begun a career as a schoolmaster, but in his thirties he discovered a strong religious vocation and was ordained as a priest of the [[Church of England]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Darlington|1968|p=13}} He  practised extremely [[high church]], [[Ritualist]] Christianity and liked to be addressed as &quot;Father Olivier&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>This made him unacceptable to most Anglican congregations,{{sfn|Darlington|1968|p=13}} and the only church posts he was offered were temporary, usually deputising for regular incumbents in their absence</span>
				<span class='text'>This meant a nomadic existence, and for Laurence's first few years, he never lived in one place long enough to make friends</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Beckett|2005|p=2}}In 1912, when Olivier was five, his father secured a permanent appointment as assistant priest at [[St Saviour's, Pimlico]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He held the post for six years, and a stable family life was at last possible</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Holden|1988|p=14}} Olivier was devoted to his mother, but not to his father, whom he found a cold and remote parent</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Beckett|2005|p=6}} Nevertheless, he learned a great deal of the art of performing from him</span>
				<span class='text'>As a young man Gerard Olivier had considered a stage career and was a dramatic and effective preacher</span>
				<span class='text'>Olivier wrote that his father knew &quot;when to drop the voice, when to bellow about the perils of hellfire, when to slip in a gag, when suddenly to wax sentimental&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>The quick changes of mood and manner absorbed me, and I have never forgotten them</span>

				<span class='text'>His elder brother was already a pupil, and Olivier gradually settled in, though he felt himself to be something of an outsider</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Holden|1988|pp=17–18}} The church's style of worship was (and remains) [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholic]], with emphasis on ritual, vestments and incense</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Findlater|1971|p=207}}{{sfn|Beckett|2005|p=9}} He later won praise in other schoolboy productions, as Maria in ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' (1918) and Katherine in ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' (1922)</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Kiernan|1981|p=20}}From All Saints, Olivier went on to [[St Edward's School, Oxford]], from 1920 to 1924</span>
				<span class='text'>He made little mark until his final year, when he played Puck in the school's production of ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''; his performance was a tour de force that won him popularity among his fellow pupils</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Holden|1988|p=26}}{{efn|Olivier had not been especially popular until then and noted in his diary at the time that he played &quot;very well, to everyone's disgust&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Barker|1984|p=15}}}} In January 1924, his brother left England to work in India as a rubber planter</span>
				<span class='text'>Olivier missed him greatly and asked his father how soon he could follow</span>
				<span class='text'>He recalled in his memoirs that his father replied, &quot;Don't be such a fool, you're not going to India, you're going on the stage</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Olivier|1994|p=15}}{{efn|Olivier said that he was surprised and moved that his father, who until then he had thought did not care about him, had devoted considerable thought to his son's future</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bragg|1989|p=38}}}}===Early acting career (1924–29)===In 1924 Gerard Olivier, a habitually frugal man, told his son that not only must he gain admission to the [[Central School of Speech and Drama|Central School of Speech Training and Dramatic Art]], but he must also gain a scholarship with a bursary to cover his tuition fees and living expenses</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Holden|1988|p=29}} Olivier's sister had been a student there and was a favourite of [[Elsie Fogerty]], the founder and principal of the school</span>
				<span class='text'>Olivier later speculated that it was on the strength of this that Fogerty agreed to award him the bursary</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Billington|2004}}{{sfn|Munn|2007|p=23}} By his own admission, he was not a very conscientious student, but Fogerty liked him and later said that he and Ashcroft stood out among her many pupils</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Holden|1988|p=32}} On leaving the school after a year, Olivier gained work with small touring companies before being taken on in 1925 by Sybil Thorndike and her husband, [[Lewis Casson]], as a bit-part player, understudy and assistant stage manager for their London company</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Beckett|2005|pp=18–19}} He modelled his performing style on that of [[Gerald du Maurier]], of whom he said, &quot;He seemed to mutter on stage but had such perfect technique</span>
				<span class='text'>When I started I was so busy doing a du Maurier that no one ever heard a word I said</span>
				<span class='text'>The Shakespearean actors one saw were terrible hams like [[Frank Benson (actor)|Frank Benson]]</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Mortimer|1984|p=61}} His concern to speak naturally and avoid what he called &quot;singing&quot; Shakespeare's verse was the cause of much frustration in his early career, with critics regularly decrying his delivery</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bragg|1989|p=59}}In 1926, on Thorndike's recommendation, Olivier joined the [[Birmingham Repertory Theatre|Birmingham Repertory Company]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Jackson|2013|p=67}} His biographer [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]] describes the Birmingham company as &quot;Olivier's university&quot;, where in his second year he was given the chance to play a wide range of important roles, including Tony Lumpkin in ''[[She Stoops to Conquer]]'', the title role in ''[[Uncle Vanya]]'', and Parolles in ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Holden|1988|p=455}} Billington adds that the engagement led to &quot;a lifelong friendship with his fellow actor [[Ralph Richardson]] that was to have a decisive effect on the British theatre</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Billington|2004}}While playing the juvenile lead in ''Bird in Hand'' at the [[Royalty Theatre]] in June 1928, Olivier began a relationship with [[Jill Esmond]], the daughter of the actors [[Henry V</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Munn|2007|p=28}} Olivier later recounted that he thought &quot;she would most certainly do excellent well for a wife&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Coleman|2006|p=32}} He was offered the part in the [[West End theatre|West End]] production the following year, but turned it down in favour of the more glamorous role of [[Beau Geste]] in a stage adaptation of [[P</span>

				<span class='text'>Wren]]'s 1929 novel of the same name</span>
				<span class='text'>''Journey's End'' became a long-running success; ''Beau Geste'' failed</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Billington|2004}} ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'' commented, &quot;Mr</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Guard: Beau Geste&quot; /&gt; For the rest of 1929 Olivier appeared in seven plays, all of which were short-lived</span>
				<span class='text'>Billington ascribes this failure rate to poor choices by Olivier rather than mere bad luck</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Billington|2004}}{{efn|Gielgud and Olivier himself later considered that not being in the nearly two-year run of ''Journey's End''{{sfn|Gaye|1967|p=1533}} helped Olivier's career</span>
				<span class='text'>Gielgud wrote in the 1970s, &quot;Olivier made his name in three plays that failed with the public—''Beau Geste'', ''The Circle of Chalk'' with [[Anna May Wong]], and ''The Rats of Norway'' by Keith Winter</span>
				<span class='text'>In all three plays he got superb notices personally, so that in a curious way it made his career to be in failures</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Gielgud|1979|p=219}} Olivier said much the same to Bragg in the 1980s</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bragg|1989|p=45}}}}===Rising star (1930–35)===In 1930, with his impending marriage in mind, Olivier earned some extra money with small roles in two films</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Olivier|1994|pp=81–82}} In April he travelled to Berlin to film the English-language version of ''[[The Temporary Widow]]'', a crime comedy with [[Lilian Harvey]],{{efn|A German-language version was also filmed, in which Olivier did not appear</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tanitch|1985|p=36}}}} and in May he spent four nights working on another comedy, ''[[Too Many Crooks (1930 film)|Too Many Crooks]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Coleman|2006|pp=38–39}} During work on the latter film, for which he was paid £60,{{efn|The £60 salary in 1930 is approximately £3,300 in 2015</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Olivier|1994|pp=81–82}} Olivier did not enjoy working in film, which he dismissed as &quot;this anaemic little medium which could not stand great acting&quot;,{{sfn|Bragg|1989|p=65}} but financially it was much more rewarding than his theatre work</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Munn|2007|p=38}}Olivier and Esmond married on 25 July 1930 at All Saints, Margaret Street,{{sfn|Coleman|2006|p=42}} although within weeks both realised they had erred</span>
				<span class='text'>Olivier later recorded that the marriage was &quot;a pretty crass mistake</span>

				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Olivier|1994|p=77}}}} Olivier later recounted that following the wedding he did not keep a diary for ten years and never followed religious practices again, although he considered those facts to be &quot;mere coincidence&quot;, unconnected to the nuptials</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Olivier|1994|p=89}}In 1930 [[Noël Coward]] cast Olivier as Victor Prynne in his new play ''[[Private Lives]]'', which opened at the new [[Phoenix Theatre (London)|Phoenix Theatre]] in London in September</span>
				<span class='text'>Coward and [[Gertrude Lawrence]] played the lead roles, Elyot Chase and Amanda Prynne</span>
				<span class='text'>Victor is a secondary character, along with Sybil Chase; the author called them &quot;extra puppets, lightly wooden ninepins, only to be repeatedly knocked down and stood up again&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lesley|1976|p=136}} To make them credible spouses for Amanda and Elyot, Coward was determined that two outstandingly attractive performers should play the parts</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lesley|1976|p=137}} Olivier played Victor in the West End and then on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]; [[Adrianne Allen]] was Sybil in London, but could not go to New York, where the part was taken by Esmond</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Castle|1972|p=115}} In addition to giving the 23-year-old Olivier his first successful West End role, Coward became something of a mentor</span>
				<span class='text'>In the late 1960s Olivier told [[Sheridan Morley]]:{{quote|He gave me a sense of balance, of right and wrong</span>

				<span class='text'>He told Tynan this was because he was influenced as a young man by [[Douglas Fairbanks]], [[Ramon Navarro]] and John Barrymore in films, and Barrymore on stage as Hamlet: &quot;tremendously athletic</span>
				<span class='text'>I admired that greatly, all of us did</span>
				<span class='text'>… One thought of oneself, idiotically, skinny as I was, as a sort of Tarzan</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tynan-interview&quot;/&gt;{{efn|Billington cites one of the best known instances of Olivier's physicality: &quot;a sense of daring [which] showed itself, physically, in such feats as his famous headlong deathfall off a 12-foot-high platform in ''Coriolanus'' (Olivier was 52 at the time)</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian-25-anniv&quot;/&gt;}}  According to Morley, Gielgud was widely considered &quot;the best actor in the world from the neck up and Olivier from the neck down</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Morley|2001|p=123}} Olivier described the contrast thus: &quot;I've always thought that we were the reverses of the same coin{{space}}</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tynan-interview&quot;/&gt;Together with Richardson and Gielgud, Olivier was internationally recognised as one of the &quot;great trinity of theatrical knights&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;strachan&quot;/&gt; who dominated the British stage during the middle and later decades of the 20th century</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;heilpern&quot;/&gt; In an obituary tribute in ''The Times'', Bernard Levin wrote, &quot;What we have lost with Laurence Olivier is ''glory''</span>
				<span class='text'>He reflected it in his greatest roles; indeed he walked clad in it—you could practically see it glowing around him like a nimbus</span>
				<span class='text'>{space}}</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>no one will ever play the roles he played as he played them; no one will replace the splendour that he gave his native land with his genius</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;levin-obit-times&quot;/&gt; Billington commented:{{quote|[Olivier] elevated the art of acting in the twentieth century&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>principally by the overwhelming force of his example</span>
				<span class='text'>Like Garrick, Kean, and Irving before him, he lent glamour and excitement to acting so that, in any theatre in the world, an Olivier night raised the level of expectation and sent spectators out into the darkness a little more aware of themselves and having experienced a transcendent touch of ecstasy</span>
				<span class='text'>That, in the end, was the true measure of his greatness</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Billington|2004}}}}After Olivier's death, Gielgud reflected, &quot;He followed in the theatrical tradition of Kean and Irving</span>
				<span class='text'>He respected tradition in the theatre, but he also took great delight in breaking tradition, which is what made him so unique</span>
				<span class='text'>He was gifted, brilliant, and one of the great controversial figures of our time in theatre, which is a virtue and not a vice at all</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Munn|2007|p=269}}Olivier said in 1963 that he believed he was born to be an actor,{{sfn|Holden|1988|p=7}} but his colleague [[Peter Ustinov]] disagreed; he commented that although Olivier's great contemporaries were clearly predestined for the stage, &quot;Larry could have been a notable ambassador, a considerable minister, a redoubtable cleric</span>
				<span class='text'>At his worst, he would have acted the parts more ably than they are usually lived</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Ustinov|1978|p=279}} The director David Ayliff agreed that acting did not come instinctively to Olivier as it did to his great rivals</span>
				<span class='text'>He observed, &quot;Ralph was a natural actor, he couldn't stop being a perfect actor; Olivier did it through sheer hard work and determination</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayliff interview&quot; /&gt; The American actor [[William Redfield (actor)|William Redfield]] had a similar view:{{quote|Ironically enough, Laurence Olivier is less gifted than Marlon Brando</span>
				<span class='text'>He is even less gifted than Richard Burton, Paul Scofield, Ralph Richardson and John Gielgud</span>
				<span class='text'>But he is still the definitive actor of the twentieth century</span>
				<span class='text'>Why? Because he wanted to be</span>
				<span class='text'>His achievements are due to dedication, scholarship, practice, determination and courage</span>
				<span class='text'>He is the bravest actor of our time</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Darlington|1968|p=91}}|}}In comparing Olivier and the other leading actors of his generation, Ustinov wrote, &quot;It is of course vain to talk of who is and who is not the greatest actor</span>
				<span class='text'>There is simply no such thing as a greatest actor, or painter or composer&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Ustinov|1978|p=200}} Nonetheless, some colleagues, particularly film actors such as [[Spencer Tracy]], [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Lauren Bacall]], came to regard Olivier as the finest of his peers</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bacall|2006|pages=214–215}} Peter Hall, though acknowledging Olivier as the head of the theatrical profession,{{sfn|Hall|1984|p=xi}} thought Richardson the greater actor</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;walker&quot;/&gt; Others, such as the critic [[Michael Coveney]], awarded the palm to Gielgud</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;coveney-on-gielgud&quot;/&gt; Olivier's claim to theatrical greatness lay not only in his acting, but as, in Hall's words, &quot;the supreme man of the theatre of our time&quot;,{{sfn|Hall|1984|p=ix}} pioneering Britain's National Theatre</span>
