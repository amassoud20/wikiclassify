				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|align=right|Sketch of a Zulu warrior]]As Shaka became more respected by his people, he was able to spread his ideas with greater ease</span>
				<span class='text'>Because of his background as a soldier, Shaka taught the Zulus that the most effective way of becoming powerful quickly was by conquering and controlling other tribes</span>
				<span class='text'>His teachings greatly influenced the social outlook of the Zulu people</span>
				<span class='text'>The Zulu tribe soon developed a &quot;warrior&quot; mindset, which Shaka turned to his advantage</span>
				<span class='text'>haka's hegemony was primarily based on military might, smashing rivals and incorporating scattered remnants into his own army</span>
				<span class='text'>He supplemented this with a mixture of diplomacy and patronage, incorporating friendly chieftains, including Zihlandlo of the Mkhize, Jobe of the Sithole, and Mathubane of the Thuli</span>
				<span class='text'>These peoples were never defeated in battle by the Zulu; they did not have to be</span>
				<span class='text'>Shaka won them over by subtler tactics, such as [[patronage]] and reward</span>
				<span class='text'>As for the ruling Qwabe, they began re-inventing their genealogies to give the impression that Qwabe and Zulu were closely related in the past</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} In this way a greater sense of cohesion was created, though it never became complete, as subsequent civil wars attest</span>
				<span class='text'>haka still recognised [[Dingiswayo]] and his larger [[Mtetwa Paramountcy|Mthethwa]] clan as overlord after he returned to the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] but, some years later, Dingiswayo was ambushed by Zwide's amaNdwandwe and killed</span>
				<span class='text'>There is no evidence to suggest that Shaka betrayed Dingiswayo</span>
				<span class='text'>Indeed, the core Zulu had to retreat before several Ndwandwe incursions; the Ndwandwe was clearly the most aggressive grouping in the sub-region</span>
				<span class='text'>haka was able to form an alliance with the leaderless Mthethwa clan and was able to establish himself amongst the Qwabe, after Phakathwayo was overthrown with relative ease</span>
				<span class='text'>With Qwabe, Hlubi and Mkhize support, Shaka was finally able to summon a force capable of resisting the Ndwandwe (of the Nxumalo clan)</span>
				<span class='text'>Historian Donald Morris states that Shaka's first major battle against [[Zwide kaLanga|Zwide]], of the [[Ndwandwe]], was the [[Battle of Gqokli Hill]], on the Mfolozi river</span>
				<span class='text'>Shaka's troops maintained a strong position on the crest of the hill</span>
				<span class='text'>A frontal assault by their opponents failed to dislodge them and Shaka sealed the victory by sending his reserve forces in a sweep around the hill to attack the enemy's rear</span>
				<span class='text'>Losses were high overall but the efficiency of the new Shakan innovations was proved</span>
				<span class='text'>It is probable that, over time, the Zulu were able to hone and improve their encirclement tactics</span>

				<span class='text'>Shaka then led a fresh reserve some {{convert|70|mi}} to the royal [[kraal]] of Zwide, ruler of the Ndwandwe, and destroyed it</span>
				<span class='text'>Zwide himself escaped with a handful of followers before falling foul of a chieftainess named Mjanji, ruler of a baBelu clan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Old Soldiers |title=The Rise and Fall of Shaka |first=Dennis |last=Bishop |volume=6 |number=2 |page=61 |url=http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>Zwide's general [[Soshangane]] (of the [[Shangaan]]) moved north towards what is now Mozambique to inflict further damage on less resistant foes and take advantage of slaving opportunities, obliging Portuguese traders to give tribute</span>
				<span class='text'>Shaka later had to contend again with Zwide's son [[Sikhunyane]] in 1826</span>
				<span class='text'>haka granted permission to Europeans to enter Zulu territory on rare occasions</span>
				<span class='text'>In the mid-1820s [[Henry Francis Fynn]] provided medical treatment to the king after an assassination attempt by a rival tribe member hidden in a crowd (see [[Nathaniel Isaacs|account of Nathaniel Isaacs]])</span>
				<span class='text'>{clarify|reason=What's the source? Why see Nathaniel Isaacs article? It says nothing about this event</span>
				<span class='text'>date=September 2014}} To show his gratitude, Shaka permitted European settlers to enter and operate in the Zulu kingdom</span>
				<span class='text'>This would open the door for future British incursions into the Zulu kingdom that were not so peaceful</span>
				<span class='text'>Shaka observed several demonstrations of European technology and knowledge, but held that the Zulu way was superior to that of the foreigners</span>

				<span class='text'>While the British colonialists considered his regime to be a future threat, allegations that European traders wished him dead are problematic given that Shaka had granted concessions to Europeans prior to his death, including the right to settle at [[Port Natal]] (now [[Durban]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Shaka had made enough enemies among his own people to hasten his demise</span>
				<span class='text'>It came relatively quickly after the death of his mother Nandi in October 1827, and the devastation caused by Shaka's subsequent erratic behavior</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Donald Morris, Shaka ordered that no crops should be planted during the following year of mourning, no milk (the basis of the Zulu diet at the time) was to be used, and any woman who became pregnant was to be killed along with her husband</span>
				<span class='text'>At least 7,000 people who were deemed to be insufficiently grief-stricken were executed, although the killing was not restricted to humans: cows were slaughtered so that their calves would know what losing a mother felt like</span>

				<span class='text'>It was all the conspirators needed—they being Shaka's half-brothers, Dingane and Mhlangana, and an [[InDuna|iNduna]] called Mbopa</span>
				<span class='text'>A diversion was created by Mbopa, and Dingane and Mhlangana struck the fatal blows</span>

				<span class='text'>haka's half-brother Dingane assumed power and embarked on an extensive purge of pro-Shaka elements and chieftains, running over several years, in order to secure his position</span>
				<span class='text'>The initial problem Dingane faced was maintaining the loyalty of the Zulu fighting regiments or amabutho</span>
				<span class='text'>He addressed this by allowing them to marry and set up a homestead (this was forbidden during Shaka's rule), and they also received cattle from Dingane</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=WashSpears /&gt;{{Rp|17–69}}]]Some older histories have doubted the military and social innovations customarily attributed to Shaka, denying them outright, or attributing them variously to European influences</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=WashSpears /&gt;{{Rp|17–69}} More modern researchers argue that such explanations fall short, and that the general Zulu culture, which included other tribes and clans, contained a number of practices that Shaka could have drawn on to fulfill his objectives, whether in raiding, conquest or hegemony</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=WashSpears /&gt;{{Rp|17–69}} Some of these practices are shown below</span>
				<span class='text'>==Weapons changes===Shaka is often said to have been dissatisfied with the long throwing &quot;[[assegai]]&quot;, and credited with introducing a new variant of the weapon: the &quot;[[iklwa]]&quot;, a short stabbing spear with a long, sword-like spearhead</span>
				<span class='text'>hough Shaka probably did not invent the iklwa, according to Zulu scholar John Laband, the leader did insist that his warriors train with the weapon, which gave them a &quot;terrifying advantage over opponents who clung to the traditional practice of throwing their spears and avoiding hand-to-hand conflict&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Laband, John 1997&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Laband |first=John |date=1997 |title=The Rise and Fall of the Zulu Nation |publisher=Arms &amp; Armour |isbn=978-1854094216}}&lt;/ref&gt; The throwing spear was not discarded but used as an initial missile weapon before close contact with the enemy, when the shorter stabbing spear was used in hand-to-hand combat</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=WashSpears /&gt;{{Rp|17–69}}Shaka is also supposed to have introduced a larger, heavier [[shield]] made of cowhide and to have taught each warrior how to use the shield's left side to hook the enemy's shield to the right, exposing his [[rib]]s for a fatal spear stab</span>
				<span class='text'>In Shaka's time, these cowhide shields were supplied by the king, and remained the king's property</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Laband, John 1997&quot;/&gt; Different coloured shields distinguished different amabutho within Shaka's army</span>
				<span class='text'>Some had black shields, others used white shields with black spots, some had white shields with brown spots, while others used pure brown or white shields</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Laband, John 1997&quot;/&gt;===Mobility of the army===The story that sandals were discarded to toughen the feet of Zulu warriors has been noted in various military accounts such as ''The Washing of the Spears'', ''Like Lions They Fought'' and ''Anatomy of the Zulu Army''</span>
				<span class='text'>Implementation was typically blunt</span>
				<span class='text'>Those who objected to going without sandals were simply killed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=WashSpears /&gt;{{Rp|51}} Shaka drilled his troops frequently, forced marches sometimes covering more than {{convert|50|mi}} a day in a fast trot over hot, rocky terrain</span>

				<span class='text'>Edgerton, 1989, ''Like Lions they Fought'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>39&lt;/ref&gt; He also drilled the troops to carry out encirclement tactics</span>
				<span class='text'>istorian John Laband dismisses these stories as myth</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;What are we to make, then, of [European trader Henry Francis] Fynn's statement that once the Zulu army reached hard and stony ground in 1826, Shaka ordered sandals of ox-hide to be made for himself?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Laband, John 1997&quot;/&gt;The idea of a {{convert|50|mi}} march in a single day is also dismissed as ridiculous</span>
				<span class='text'>Laband further claims that even though these stories have been repeated by &quot;astonished and admiring white commentators&quot;, the Zulu army covered &quot;no more than {{convert|19|km}} a day, and usually went only about {{convert|14|km}}&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Laband, John 1997&quot;/&gt; Furthermore, Zulus under Shaka sometimes advanced more slowly</span>
				<span class='text'>They spent two whole days recuperating in one instance, and on another they rested for a day and two nights before pursuing their enemy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Laband, John 1997&quot;/&gt; Several other historians of the Zulu, and the Zulu military system however, affirm the mobility rate of up to 50 miles per day</span>

				<span class='text'>It is sometimes held that such support was used more for very light forces designed to extract tribute in cattle and slaves from neighbouring groups</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, the concept of &quot;light&quot; forces is questionable</span>
				<span class='text'>The fast-moving Zulu raiding party or &quot;ibutho lempi&quot; on a mission invariably traveled light, driving cattle as provisions on the hoof, and were not weighed down with heavy weapons and supply packs</span>
				<span class='text'>The herdboy logistic structure was deployed in support of these relatively short-term operations, and was easily adaptable to large or small expeditions</span>

				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=July 2015}}==Shaka as borrower not innovator==Some scholars{{who|date=July 2015}} hold that popular depictions of Shaka as a suddenly appearing genius creating innovation are overstated, and that to the contrary, Shaka was a borrower and imitator of indigenous methods, customs and even ruler-lineages already in place</span>
				<span class='text'>They also argue that Shaka's line was relatively short-lived and receives undue attention, compared to other, longer established lines and rulers in the region</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=July 2015}}::&quot;It seems much more likely that Shaka, seeking to build the power of a previously insignificant chiefdom, drew on an existing heritage of statecraft known to his immediate neighbors</span>
				<span class='text'>Soga implied as much when he used genealogical evidence to argue that the Zulu were an upstart group inferior in dignity and distinction to established chiefdoms in their region, for example, the Hlubi, Ndwandwe, and Dlamini lines</span>
				<span class='text'>3 Using different informants and genealogical charts,Bryant arrived at similar conclusions</span>
				<span class='text'>The Zulu line-&quot;a royal house of doubtful pedigree&quot;-was very short in comparison to the Langene, Ndwandwe, Swazi, and Hlubi lines</span>
				<span class='text'>4{{citation needed|reason=needs cite for this quote which is apparentlym by this footnote, taken from somewhere else</span>
				<span class='text'>Is there a copyvio?|date=July 2015}} Using his standard formula of eighteen years per reign, Bryant calculated that the Swazi, Ndwandwe, and Hlubi lines could be traced back to the beginning of the fifteenth century, while the eponymous chief Zulu had died at the beginning of the eighteenth century</span>
				<span class='text'>haka's triumphs did not succeed in obliterating or diminishing the memories of his better-born rivals</span>
				<span class='text'>The hypothesis that several states of a new kind arose about the same time does not take account of the contrast between the short line of Shaka and the long pedigrees of his most important opponents-especially the coalition grouped around his deadly enemy Zwide (d</span>
				<span class='text'>1822)</span>
				<span class='text'>The founders of the states which Omer-Cooper called &quot;Zulu-type states,&quot; including the Ndebele, the Gasa, the Ngoni, and the Swazi had all been closely associated with Zwide</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead of hypothesizing that they all chose to imitate Shaka, it is easier to imagine that he modeled his state on theirs</span>
				<span class='text'>And as they stemmed from ancient families it is entirely possible that states of that type existed in a more remote past</span>
				<span class='text'>Soga and Bryant related each of them to a larger grouping they called Mho</span>
