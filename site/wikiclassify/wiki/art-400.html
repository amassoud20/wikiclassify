				<span class='text'>Following the earlier advice of Mission Control, they undocked, but found that the roll increased dramatically to the point where they were turning about once per second, which meant the problem was in their Gemini's attitude control</span>

				<span class='text'>]The objective of ''Apollo&amp;nbsp;11'' was to land safely rather than to touch down with precision on a particular spot</span>
				<span class='text'>Three minutes into the lunar descent burn, Armstrong noted that craters were passing about two seconds too early, which meant the ''Eagle'' would probably touch down beyond the planned landing zone by several miles</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Andrew |title=Moon Dust |publisher=[[Bloomsbury]] |date=2006 |isbn=0-7475-6369-1 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the ''Eagle'''s landing [[radar]] acquired the surface, several computer error alarms appeared</span>
				<span class='text'>The first was a code [[Jack Garman#1202|1202]] alarm, and even with their extensive training, neither Armstrong nor Aldrin was aware of what this code meant</span>
				<span class='text'>They promptly received word from [[capsule communicator|CAPCOM]] [[Charles Duke]] in Houston that the alarms were not a concern; the 1202 and 1201 alarms were caused by an [[Computer multitasking|executive overflow]] in the [[Apollo Guidance Computer|lunar module computer]]</span>
				<span class='text'>As described by Buzz Aldrin in the documentary ''[[In the Shadow of the Moon (film)|In the Shadow of the Moon]]'', the overflow condition was caused by his own counter-checklist choice of leaving the docking radar on during the landing process, so the computer had to process unnecessary radar data and did not have enough time to execute all tasks, dropping lower-priority ones</span>
				<span class='text'>Aldrin stated that he did so with the objective of facilitating re-docking with the CM should an abort become necessary, not realizing that it would cause the overflow condition</span>
				<span class='text'>hen Armstrong noticed they were heading towards a landing area which he believed was unsafe, he took over manual control of the LM, and attempted to find an area which seemed safer, taking longer than expected, and longer than most simulations had taken</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Upon landing, Aldrin and Armstrong believed they had about 40&amp;nbsp;seconds worth of fuel left, including the 20&amp;nbsp;seconds worth of fuel which had to be saved in the event of an abort</span>
