				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=April 2014}}Waller ultimately became one of the most popular performers of his era, finding critical and commercial success in his homeland and in Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>He was also a prolific songwriter and many songs he wrote or co-wrote are still popular, such as &quot;[[Honeysuckle Rose (song)|Honeysuckle Rose]]&quot;, &quot;[[Ain't Misbehavin' (song)|Ain't Misbehavin']]&quot; and &quot;[[Squeeze Me]]&quot;</span>
