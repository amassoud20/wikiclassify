				<span class='text'>In fact, his plays are the main source of information about him</span>
				<span class='text'>It was conventional in [[Old Comedy]] for the [[Greek chorus|Chorus]] to speak on behalf of the author during an address called the '[[Aristophanes#Parabasis|parabasis]]' and thus some biographical facts can be found there</span>
				<span class='text'>However, these facts relate almost entirely to his career as a dramatist and the plays contain few clear and unambiguous clues about his personal beliefs or his private life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Greek Comedy and Ideology'' David Konstan, Oxford University Press US 1995, page 6&lt;/ref&gt; He was a comic ''poet'' in an age when it was conventional for a poet to assume the role of 'teacher' ([[Theatre director#The director in theatre history|didaskalos]]), and though this specifically referred to his training of the Chorus in rehearsal, it also covered his relationship with the audience as a commentator on significant issues</span>

				<span class='text'>He caricatured leading figures in the arts (notably [[Euripides]], whose influence on his own work however he once begrudgingly acknowledged),&lt;ref name=&quot;Barrett 2003 p</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;&gt;Barrett (2003) p</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt; in politics (especially the populist [[Cleon]]), and in philosophy/religion (where Socrates was the most obvious target)</span>
				<span class='text'>Such caricatures seem to imply that Aristophanes was an old-fashioned conservative, yet that view of him leads to contradictions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Greek Society'' Antony Andrewes, [[Pelican Books]], 1981, pages 247-48&lt;/ref&gt;It has been argued that Aristophanes produced plays mainly to entertain the audience and to win prestigious competitions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds'' A</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Sommerstein (ed), [[Penguin Books]] 1975, page9, footnote&lt;/ref&gt; His plays were written for production at the great dramatic festivals of Athens, the [[Lenaia]] and [[City Dionysia]], where they were judged and awarded prizes in competition with the works of other comic dramatists</span>
				<span class='text'>An elaborate series of lotteries, designed to prevent prejudice and corruption, reduced the voting judges at the City Dionysia to just five in number</span>
				<span class='text'>These judges probably reflected the mood of the audiences&lt;ref&gt;Barrett (1964) p</span>
				<span class='text'>6&lt;/ref&gt; yet there is much uncertainty about the composition of those audiences</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barrett (1964) p</span>
				<span class='text'>5&lt;/ref&gt; The theatres were certainly huge, with seating for at least 10&amp;nbsp;000 at the Theatre of Dionysus</span>
				<span class='text'>The day's program at the City Dionysia for example was crowded, with three tragedies and a '[[satyr]]' play ahead of a comedy, but it is possible that many of the poorer citizens (typically the main supporters of [[demagogues]] like Cleon) occupied the festival holiday with other pursuits</span>
				<span class='text'>The conservative views expressed in the plays might therefore reflect the attitudes of the dominant group in an unrepresentative audience</span>
				<span class='text'>The production process might also have influenced the views expressed in the plays</span>
				<span class='text'>Throughout most of Aristophanes' career, the Chorus was essential to a play's success and it was recruited and funded by a ''[[choregus]]'', a wealthy citizen appointed to the task by one of the [[archon]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>A choregus could regard his personal expenditure on the Chorus as a civic duty and a public honour, but Aristophanes showed in ''[[The Knights]]'' that wealthy citizens might regard civic responsibilities as punishment imposed on them by demagogues and populists like Cleon</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>eldart (eds), Oxford Classical Texts, ''The Knights'' lines 911-25&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the political conservatism of the plays may reflect the views of the wealthiest section of Athenian society, on whose generosity all dramatists depended for putting on their plays</span>

				<span class='text'>His plays often express pride in the achievement of the older generation (the [[Greco-Persian Wars#Battle of Marathon|victors at Marathon]])&lt;ref&gt;''Wasps'' 1075-1101 [http://el</span>

				<span class='text'>The plays are particularly scathing in criticism of war profiteers, among whom populists such as Cleon figure prominently</span>
				<span class='text'>By the time his last play was produced (around 386 BC) Athens had been defeated in war, its empire had been dismantled and it had undergone a transformation from being the political to the intellectual centre of Greece</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds'' A</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>ommerstein (ed), Penguin Books 1975, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>13-14&lt;/ref&gt; Aristophanes was part of this transformation and he shared in the intellectual fashions of the period&amp;nbsp;— the structure of his plays evolves from Old Comedy until, in his last surviving play, ''[[Plutus (play)|Wealth II]]'', it more closely resembles [[Ancient Greek comedy#New Comedy (nea)|New Comedy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>However it is uncertain whether he led or merely responded to changes in audience expectations</span>

				<span class='text'>He won first prize there with his next play, ''The Babylonians'' (also now lost)</span>
				<span class='text'>It was usual for foreign dignitaries to attend the City Dionysia, and ''The Babylonians'' caused some embarrassment for the Athenian authorities since it depicted the cities of the [[Athenian League]] as slaves grinding at a mill</span>

				<span class='text'>The details of the trial are unrecorded but, speaking through the hero of his third play ''[[The Acharnians]]'' (staged at the [[Lenaia]], where there were few or no foreign dignitaries), the poet carefully distinguishes between the ''polis'' and the real targets of his acerbic wit:{{lang|grc|::ἡμῶν γὰρ ἄνδρες, κοὐχὶ τὴν πόλιν λέγω,::μέμνησθε τοῦθ᾽ ὅτι οὐχὶ τὴν πόλιν λέγω,::ἀλλ᾽ ἀνδράρια μοχθηρά, παρακεκομμένα</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Aristophanes repeatedly savages Cleon in his later plays</span>
				<span class='text'>But these satirical diatribes appear to have had no effect on Cleon's political career&amp;nbsp;— a few weeks after the performance of ''The Knights'' - a play full of anti-Cleon jokes - Cleon was elected to the prestigious board of ten generals</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barrett (2003) p</span>
				<span class='text'>4&lt;/ref&gt; Cleon also seems to have had no real power to limit or control Aristophanes: the caricatures of him continued up to and even beyond his death</span>
				<span class='text'>n the absence of clear biographical facts about Aristophanes, scholars make educated guesses based on interpretation of the language in the plays</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Inscriptiones Graecae|Inscriptions]] and summaries or comments by Hellenistic and Byzantine scholars can also provide useful clues</span>
				<span class='text'>We know however from a combination of these sources,&lt;ref&gt;D</span>
				<span class='text'>elsh, ''IG ii&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 2343, Philonides and Aristophanes' Banqueters'', Classical Quarterly 33 (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; and especially from comments in ''The Knights''&lt;ref&gt;''Knights 512-14&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Clouds'',&lt;ref&gt;''Clouds'' 530-33&lt;/ref&gt; that Aristophanes' first three plays were not directed by him&amp;nbsp;— they were instead directed by Callistratus and Philoneides,&lt;ref&gt;Ian Storey, General Introduction, in ''Clouds, Wasps, Birds By Aristophanes'', [[Peter Meineck]] (translator), [[Hackett Publishing]] 1998, page xiii&lt;/ref&gt; an arrangement that seemed to suit Aristophanes since he appears to have used these same directors in many later plays as well (Philoneides for example later directed ''The Frogs'' and he was also credited, perhaps wrongly, with directing ''The Wasps''</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;ref&gt;MacDowell (1971) p</span>
				<span class='text'>24&lt;/ref&gt; Aristophanes's use of directors complicates our reliance on the plays as sources of biographical information because apparent self-references might have been made with reference to his directors instead</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus for example a statement by the chorus in ''The Acharnians''&lt;ref&gt;''The Acharnians'' [http://el</span>

				<span class='text'>rg/wiki/%CE%91%CF%87%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%BD%CE%B5%CE%AF%CF%82 Wikisource original Greek] lines 652-54&lt;/ref&gt; seems to indicate that the 'poet' had a close, personal association with the island of [[Aegina]], yet the terms 'poet' (''poietes'') and 'director' (''didaskalos'') are often interchangeable as dramatic poets usually directed their own plays and therefore the reference in the play could be either to Aristophanes or Callistratus</span>
				<span class='text'>Similarly, the hero in ''The Acharnians'' complains about Cleon &quot;dragging me into court&quot; over &quot;last year's play&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Acharnians'' [http://el</span>

				<span class='text'>0&lt;/ref&gt; He appears to have modelled his approach to language on that of Euripides in particular, so much so that the comic dramatist [[Cratinus]] labelled him a 'Euripidaristophanist' addicted to hair-splitting niceties</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Barrett 2003 p</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;/&gt;A full appreciation of Aristophanes' plays requires an understanding of the poetic forms he employed with virtuoso skill, and of their different rhythms and associations</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;MacDowell (1978) p</span>
				<span class='text'>1&lt;/ref&gt; There were three broad poetic forms: iambic dialogue, tetrameter verses and lyrics:&lt;ref&gt;Barrett (2003) pp</span>
				<span class='text'>-8&lt;/ref&gt;* '''Iambic dialogue''': Aristophanes achieves an effect resembling natural speech through the use of the [[iambic trimeter]] (corresponding to the effects achieved by English poets such as Shakespeare using iambic pentameters)</span>
				<span class='text'>His realistic use of the metre&lt;ref name=&quot;Other Plays' 2003, page 27&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacDowell (1978) p</span>
				<span class='text'>6&lt;/ref&gt; makes it ideal for both dialogue and soliloquy, as for instance in the prologue, before the arrival of the Chorus, when the audience is introduced to the main issues in the plot</span>
				<span class='text'>''The Acharnians'' opens with these three lines by the hero, Dikaiopolis (rendered here in English as iambic pentameters):::How many are the things that vex my heart!::Pleasures are few, so very few&amp;nbsp;— just four -::But stressful things are manysandthousandsandheaps!&lt;ref&gt;Original Greek, Wikisource ''The Acharnians'' [http://el</span>

				<span class='text'>The use of invented [[compound words]] is another comic device frequently found in the plays</span>

				<span class='text'>Anapestic rhythms are naturally jaunty (as in many [[Limerick (poetry)|limerick]]s) and trochaic metre is suited to rapid delivery (the word 'trochee' is in fact derived from ''trechein'', 'to run', as demonstrated for example by choruses who enter at speed, often in aggressive mood)&lt;ref&gt;L</span>

				<span class='text'>7&lt;/ref&gt; Aristophanes often varies them through use of complex syntax and substituted metres, adapting the rhythms to the requirements of serious argument</span>
				<span class='text'>In an anapestic passage in ''The Frogs'', for instance, the character Aeschylus presents a view of poetry that is supposed to be serious but which leads to a comic interruption by the god, Dionysus:::'''AES</span>

				<span class='text'>Such subtle variations in rhythm are common in the plays, allowing for serious points to be made while still whetting the audience's appetite for the next joke</span>
				<span class='text'> '''Lyrics''': Almost nothing is known about the music that accompanied Greek lyrics, and the metre is often so varied and complex that it is difficult for modern readers or audiences to get a feel for the intended effects, yet Aristophanes still impresses with the charm and simplicity of his lyrics</span>

				<span class='text'>==Rhetoric===It is widely believed that Aristophanes condemned rhetoric on both moral and political grounds</span>
				<span class='text'>He states, “a speaker trained in the new rhetoric may use his talents to deceive the jury and bewilder his opponents so thoroughly that the trial loses all semblance of fairness”&lt;ref name=&quot;Murphy, Charles T 1938&quot;&gt;Murphy, Charles T</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'>He is speaking to the “art” of flattery, and evidence points towards the fact that many of Aristophanes’ plays were actually created with the intent to attack the view of rhetoric</span>
				<span class='text'>The most noticeable attack can be seen in his play Banqueters, in which two brothers from different educational backgrounds argue over which education is better</span>
				<span class='text'>One brother comes from a background of “old-fashioned” education while the other brother appears to be a product of the sophistic education &lt;ref name=&quot;Murphy, Charles T 1938&quot;/&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'>          The chorus was mainly used by Aristophanes as a defense against rhetoric and would often talk about topics such as the civic duty of those who were educated in classical teachings</span>
				<span class='text'>In Aristophanes’ opinion it was the job of those educated adults to protect the public from the deception and to stand as a beacon of light for those who were more gullible than others</span>
				<span class='text'>One of the main reasons why Aristophanes was so against the sophists came into existence from the requirements listed by the leaders of the organization</span>
				<span class='text'>Money was essential, which meant that roughly all of the pupils studying with the sophists came from upper-class backgrounds and excluded the rest of the polis</span>
				<span class='text'>Aristophanes believed that education and knowledge was a public service and that anything that excluded willing minds was nothing but an abomination</span>

				<span class='text'>or convenience, Old Comedy, as represented by Aristophanes' early plays, is analysed below in terms of three broad characteristics&amp;nbsp;— topicality, festivity and complexity</span>
				<span class='text'>Dramatic structure contributes to the complexity of Aristophanes' plays</span>
				<span class='text'>However, it is associated with poetic rhythms and meters that have little relevance to English translations and it is therefore treated in a separate section</span>
				<span class='text'>==Topicality===Old Comedy's emphasis on real personalities and local issues makes the plays difficult to appreciate today without the aid of scholarly commentaries&amp;nbsp;— see for example articles on ''[[The Knights]]'', ''[[The Wasps]]'' and ''[[Peace (play)|Peace]]'' for lists of topical references</span>
				<span class='text'>The topicality of the plays had unique consequences for both the writing and the production of the plays in ancient Athens</span>
				<span class='text'> '''Individual masks''': All actors in [[classical Athens]] wore masks, but whereas in tragedy and New Comedy these identified stereotypical characters, in Old Comedy the masks were often caricatures of real people</span>
				<span class='text'>Perhaps Socrates attracted a lot of attention in Old Comedy because his face lent itself easily to caricature by mask-makers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, Clouds'' A</span>
				<span class='text'>Sommerstein, Penguin Classics 1975, page 31&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Knights'' we are told that the mask makers were too afraid to make a caricature of Cleon (there represented as a Paphlagonian slave) but we are assured that the audience is clever enough to identify him anyway</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Knights'' lines 230-33&lt;/ref&gt;* '''The real scene of action''': Since Old Comedy makes numerous references to people in the audience, the theatre itself was the real scene of action and theatrical illusion was treated as something of a joke</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''The Acharnians'', for example, The [[Pnyx]] is just a few steps from the hero's front door, and in ''Peace'' Olympia is separated from Athens by a few moments' supposed flight on a dung beetle</span>
				<span class='text'>The audience is sometimes drawn or even dragged into the action</span>
				<span class='text'>When the hero in ''Peace'' returns to Athens from his flight to Olympia, he tells the audience that they looked like rascals when seen from the heavens, and seen up close they look even worse</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Peace'' 821-23&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Acharnians'' the hero confronts the [[Archon|archon basileus]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Acharnians'' [http://el</span>

				<span class='text'> '''Self-mocking theatre''': Frequent parodying of tragedy is an aspect of Old Comedy that modern audiences find difficult to understand</span>
				<span class='text'>But the Lenaia and City Dionysia included performances of both comedies and tragedies, and thus references to tragedy were highly topical and immediately relevant to the original audience</span>

				<span class='text'>Griffin and O</span>
				<span class='text'>Murray (eds), Oxford University Press 1986, page 176&lt;/ref&gt; The comic dramatist also poked fun at comic poets and he even ridiculed himself</span>
				<span class='text'>It is possible, as indicated earlier, that Aristophanes mocked his own baldness</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''The Clouds'', the Chorus compares him to an unwed, young mother&lt;ref&gt;''Clouds'' lines 528-33&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''The Acharnians'' the Chorus mockingly depicts him as Athens' greatest weapon in the war against Sparta</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Acharnians'' lines 646-51&lt;/ref&gt;* '''Political theatre''': The Lenaia and City Dionysus were state-sponsored, religious festivals, and though the latter was the more prestigious of the two, both were occasions for official pomp and circumstance</span>
				<span class='text'>The ceremonies for the Lenaia were overseen by the [[archon basileus]] and by officials of the [[Eleusinian mysteries]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The City Dionysia was overseen by the [[Archon|archon eponymous]] and the priest of Dionysus</span>
				<span class='text'>Opening ceremonies for the City Dionysia featured, in addition to the ceremonial arrival of the god, a parade in full armour of the sons of warriors who died fighting for the polis and, until the end of the Peloponnesian War, a presentation of annual tribute from subject states</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes:Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds'' A</span>
				<span class='text'>ommerstein, Penguin Classics 1973, pages 18-19&lt;/ref&gt; Religious and political issues were topics that could hardly be ignored in such a setting and the plays often treat them quite seriously</span>
				<span class='text'>Even jokes can be serious when the topic is politics&amp;nbsp;— especially in wartime</span>
				<span class='text'>The butts of the most savage jokes are opportunists who prey on the gullibility of their fellow citizens, including oracle-mongers,&lt;ref&gt;e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>''Knights'' lines 997-1095; ''Birds'' lines 959-91&lt;/ref&gt; the exponents of new religious practices,&lt;ref&gt;e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>''Clouds'' lines 263-66, ''Frogs'' lines 891-94&lt;/ref&gt; war-profiteers and political fanatics</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''The Acharnians'', for example, [[Lamachus]] is represented as a crazed militarist whose preparations for war are hilariously compared to the hero's preparations for a dinner party</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Acharnians'' lines 1097-1142 lines&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cleon]] emerges from numerous similes and metaphors in ''The Knights'' as a protean form of comic evil, clinging to political power by every possible means for as long as he can, yet the play also includes simple hymns invoking Poseidon and Athena,&lt;ref&gt;''Knights'' lines 551-64 and 581-594&lt;/ref&gt; and it ends with visions of a miraculously transformed Demos (i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>the morally reformed citizenry of Athens)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Knights'' lines 1321-38&lt;/ref&gt; Imaginative visions of a return to peaceful activities resulting from peace with Sparta,&lt;ref&gt;e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>''Peace'' lines 551-97&lt;/ref&gt; and a plea for leniency for citizens suspected of complicity in an oligarchic revolt&lt;ref&gt;''Frogs'' lines 686-705&lt;/ref&gt; are other examples of a serious purpose behind the plays</span>
				<span class='text'> '''Teasing and taunting''': A festival audience presented the comic dramatist with a wide range of targets, not just political or religious ones&amp;nbsp;— anyone known to the audience could be mocked for any reason, such as diseases, physical deformities, ugliness, family misfortunes, bad manners, perversions, dishonesty, cowardice in battle, and clumsiness</span>

				<span class='text'>Dover (ed), Oxford University Press 1970, pages XIII-XIV&lt;/ref&gt; Foreigners, a conspicuous presence in imperial Athens, particularly at the City Dionysia, often appear in the plays comically mispronouncing Attic words&amp;nbsp;— these include Spartans (''Lysistrata''), Scythians (''Thesmophoriazusae''), Persians, Boeotians and Megarians (''The Acharnians'')</span>
				<span class='text'>==Festivity===The Lenaia and City Dionysia were religious festivals, but they resembled a gala rather than a church service</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Dover, Oxford University Press 1970, page XV&lt;/ref&gt;* '''Dirty jokes''': A relaxation in standards of behaviour was permitted and the holiday spirit included bawdy irreverence towards both men and gods</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;&quot;Greek Drama&quot; Peter Levi in ''The Oxford History of the Classical World'', Oxford University Press 1986, page 175&lt;/ref&gt; Old Comedy is rich in obscenities and the crude jokes are often very detailed and difficult to understand without expert commentary, as when the Chorus in ''The Acharnians'' places a curse on Antimachus,&lt;ref&gt;[http://el</span>

				<span class='text'>rg/wiki/%CE%91%CF%87%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%BD%CE%B5%CE%AF%CF%82 ''The Acharnians'' Wikisource original Greek lines 1164-73]&lt;/ref&gt; a choregus accused of niggardly conduct, wishing upon him a night-time mugging as he returns home from some drunken party and envisioning him, as he stoops down to pick up a rock in the darkness, accidentally picking up a fresh turd instead</span>
				<span class='text'>He is then envisioned hurling the turd at his attacker, missing and accidentally hitting Cratinus, a lyric poet not admired by Aristophanes</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds'' A</span>
				<span class='text'>Sommerstein, Penguin Classics, pages 243-4, notes 69,80,81&lt;/ref&gt; This was particularly funny because the curse was sung (or chanted) in choreographed style by a Chorus of 24 grown men who were otherwise known to the audience as respectable citizens</span>
				<span class='text'> '''The musical extravaganza''': The Chorus was vital to the success of a play in Old Comedy long after it had lost its relevance for tragedy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: The Frogs and Other Plays'' David Barrett, Penguin Classics 1964, pages 14-15&lt;/ref&gt; Technically, the competition in the dramatic festivals was not between poets but between choruses</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds'' A</span>
				<span class='text'>Sommerstein, Penguin Classics, page 23&lt;/ref&gt; In fact eight of Aristophanes' eleven surviving plays are named after the Chorus</span>
				<span class='text'>In Aristophanes' time, the Chorus in tragedy was relatively small (twelve members) and its role had been reduced to that of an awkwardly placed commentator, but in Old Comedy the Chorus was large (numbering 24), it was actively involved in the plot, its entry into the action was frequently spectacular, its movements were practised with military precision and sometimes it was involved in choreographed skirmishes with the actors</span>

				<span class='text'>rg/wiki/%CE%A3%CF%86%CE%AE%CE%BA%CE%B5%CF%82 Wikisource original Greek]&lt;/ref&gt;  The expenditure on costumes, training and maintenance of a Chorus was considerable,&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: The Frogs and Other Plays'' David Barrett, Penguin Classics 1964, page 9&lt;/ref&gt; and perhaps many people in the original audience enjoyed comedy mainly for the spectacle and music</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: Wasps'' Douglas MacDowell (ed), Oxford University Press 1978, page 14-15&lt;/ref&gt; The chorus gradually lost its significance as New Comedy began to develop</span>
				<span class='text'> '''Obvious costumes''': Consistent with the holiday spirit, much of the humour in Old Comedy is slapstick buffoonery and dirty jokes that do not require the audience's careful attention, often relying on visual cues</span>
				<span class='text'>Actors playing male roles appear to have worn tights over grotesque padding, with a prodigious, leather phallus barely concealed by a short tunic</span>
				<span class='text'>Female characters were played by men but were easily recognized in long, saffron tunics</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds'' A</span>
				<span class='text'>Sommerstein, Penguin Classics, page 29&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the visual cues are deliberately confused for comic effect, as in ''The Frogs'', where Dionysus arrives on stage in a saffron tunic, the buskin boots of a tragic actor and a lion skin cloak that usually characterized [[Heracles]] - an absurd outfit that provokes the character Heracles (as no doubt it provoked the audience) to guffaws of helpless mirth</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Frogs'' lines 45-47&lt;/ref&gt;* '''The farcical anti-climax''': The holiday spirit might also have been responsible for an aspect of the comic plot that can seem bewildering to modern audiences</span>
				<span class='text'>The major confrontation (''agon'') between the 'good' and 'bad' characters in a play is often resolved decisively in favour of the former long before the end of the play</span>
				<span class='text'>The rest of the play deals with farcical consequences in a succession of loosely connected scenes</span>
				<span class='text'>The farcical anti-climax has been explained in a variety of ways, depending on the particular play</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''The Wasps'', for instance, it has been thought to indicate a gradual change in the main character's perspective as the lessons of the agon are slowly absorbed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: Wasps'' Douglas MacDowell, Oxford University Press 1978, page 7&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Acharnians'', it has been explained in terms of a unifying theme that underlies the episodes, demonstrating the practical benefits that come with wisdom</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds'' A</span>
				<span class='text'>Sommerstein, Penguin Classics, pages 33-34&lt;/ref&gt; But the early release of dramatic tension is consistent with the holiday meanings in Old Comedy&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes' Old-and-new Comedy'' Kenneth J</span>
				<span class='text'>eckford, UNC Press 1987, page 15&lt;/ref&gt; and it allows the audience to relax in uncomplicated enjoyment of the spectacle, the music, jokes and celebrations that characterize the remainder of the play</span>
				<span class='text'>The celebration of the hero's victory often concludes in a sexual conquest and sometimes it takes the form of a wedding, thus providing the action with a joyous sense of closure</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: The Frogs and Other Plays'' David Barrett, Penguin Classics 1964, pages 13-14&lt;/ref&gt;===Complexity===The development of New Comedy involved a trend towards more realistic plots, a simpler dramatic structure and a softer tone</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes'' D</span>
				<span class='text'>Slavitt and P</span>
				<span class='text'>Bovie (eds), University of Pennsylvania Press 1999, page XIII&lt;/ref&gt; Old Comedy was the comedy of a vigorously democratic polis at the height of its power and it gave Aristophanes the freedom to explore the limits of humour, even to the point of undermining the humour itself</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes and the Definition of Comedy'' M</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>ilk, Oxford University Press 2002, page 418&lt;/ref&gt;* '''Inclusive comedy''': Old Comedy provided a variety of entertainments for a diverse audience</span>
				<span class='text'>It accommodated a serious purpose, light entertainment, hauntingly beautiful lyrics, the buffoonery of puns and invented words, obscenities, disciplined verse, wildly absurd plots and a formal, dramatic structure</span>
				<span class='text'> '''Fantasy and absurdity''': Fantasy in Old Comedy is unrestricted and impossibilities are ignored</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: Clouds'' K</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>over, Oxford University Press 1970, page XIII&lt;/ref&gt; Situations are developed logically to absurd conclusions, an approach to humour that is echoed for instance in the works of [[Lewis Carroll]] and [[Eugène Ionesco]] (the [[Theatre of the Absurd]])</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: Wasps'' Douglas MacDowell, Oxford University Press 1978, page 12&lt;/ref&gt; The crazy costume worn by Dionysus in ''The Frogs'' is typical of an absurd result obtained on logical grounds&amp;nbsp;— he wears a woman's saffron-coloured tunic because effeminacy is an aspect of his divinity, buskin boots because he is interested in reviving the art of tragedy, and a lion skin cape because, like Heracles, his mission leads him into [[Hades]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Absurdities develop logically from initial premises in a plot</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''The Knights'' for instance, Cleon's corrupt service to the people of Athens is originally depicted as a household relationship in which the slave dupes his master</span>
				<span class='text'>The introduction of a rival, who is not a member of the household, leads to an absurd shift in the metaphor, so that Cleon and his rival become [[Pederasty in ancient Greece#Terminology|erastai]] competing for the affections of an [[eromenos]], hawkers of oracles competing for the attention of a credulous public, athletes in a race for approval and orators competing for the popular vote</span>
				<span class='text'> '''The resourceful hero''': In Aristophanic comedy, the hero is an independent-minded and self-reliant individual</span>
				<span class='text'>He has something of the ingenuity of Homer's [[Odysseus]] and much of the shrewdness of the farmer idealized in [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Works and Days]]'', subjected to corrupt leaders and unreliable neighbours</span>
				<span class='text'>Typically he devises a complicated and highly fanciful escape from an intolerable situation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Clouds'' Peter Meineck (translator) and Ian Storey (Introduction), Hackett Publishing 2000, page VIII&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Dikaiopolis in ''The Acharnians'' contrives a ''private'' peace treaty with the Spartans; Bdelucleon in ''The Wasps'' turns his own house into a private law court in order to keep his jury-addicted father safely at home; Trygaeus in ''Peace'' flies to Olympus on a giant dung beetle to obtain an end to the Peloponnesian War; Pisthetairus in ''Birds'' sets off to establish his own colony and becomes instead the ruler of the bird kingdom and a rival to the gods</span>
				<span class='text'> '''The resourceful cast''': The numerous surprising developments in an Aristophanic plot, the changes in scene, and the farcical comings and goings of minor characters towards the end of a play, were managed according to theatrical convention with only three principal actors (a fourth actor, often the leader of the chorus, was permitted to deliver short speeches)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: The Frogs and other Plays'' David Barrett (ed), Penguin Classics 1964, page 17&lt;/ref&gt; Songs and addresses to the audience by the Chorus gave the actors hardly enough time off-stage to draw breath and to prepare for changes in scene</span>
				<span class='text'> '''Complex structure''': The action of an Aristophanic play obeyed a crazy logic of its own and yet it always unfolded within a formal, dramatic structure that was repeated with minor variations from one play to another</span>
				<span class='text'>The different, structural elements are associated with different poetic meters and rhythms and these are generally lost in English translations</span>
				<span class='text'>==Dramatic structure===The structural elements of a typical Aristophanic plot can be summarized as follows:* '''prologue''' - an introductory scene with a dialogue and/or soliloquy addressed to the audience, expressed in [[iambic trimeter]] and explaining the situation that is to be resolved in the play;* '''parodos''' - the arrival of the chorus, dancing and singing, sometimes followed by a choreographed skirmish with one or more actors, often expressed in long lines of tetrameters;* '''symmetrical scenes''' - passages featuring songs and declaimed verses in long lines of tetrameters, arranged symmetrically in two sections such that each half resembles the other in meter and line length; the agon and parabasis can be considered specific instances of symmetrical scenes:** '''parabasis''' - verses through which the Chorus addresses the audience directly, firstly in the middle of the play and again near the end (see the section below [[Aristophanes#Parabasis|Parabasis]]);** '''agon''' - a formal debate that decides the outcome of the play, typically in anapestic tetrameter, though iambs are sometimes used to delineate inferior arguments;&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes:Wasps'' D</span>
				<span class='text'>MacDowell (ed</span>
				<span class='text'>, Oxford University Press 1971, page 207 note 546-630&lt;/ref&gt;* '''episodes''' - sections of dialogue in iambic trimeter, often in a succession of scenes featuring minor characters towards the end of a play;* '''songs''' ('strophes'/'antistrophes' or 'odes'/'antodes') - often in symmetrical pairs where each half has the same meter and number of lines as the other, used as transitions between other structural elements, or between scenes while actors change costume, and often commenting on the action;* '''exodus''' - the departure of the Chorus and the actors, in song and dance celebrating the hero's victory and sometimes celebrating a symbolic marriage</span>
				<span class='text'>he rules of competition did not prevent a playwright arranging and adjusting these elements to suit his particular needs</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds'' A</span>
				<span class='text'>Sommerstein, Penguin Classics 1975, page 27&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Acharnians'' and ''Peace'', for example, there is no formal agon whereas in ''The Clouds'' there are two agons</span>
				<span class='text'>===Parabasis====The parabasis is an address to the audience by the chorus or chorus leader while the actors leave or have left the stage</span>
				<span class='text'>In this role, the chorus is sometimes out of character, as the author's voice, and sometimes in character, although these capacities are often difficult to distinguish</span>
				<span class='text'>Generally the parabasis occurs somewhere in the middle of a play and often there is a second parabasis towards the end</span>
				<span class='text'>The elements of a parabasis have been defined and named by scholars but it is probable that Aristophanes' own understanding was less formal</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: Wasps'' Dougles MacDowell, Oxford University Press 1978, page 261&lt;/ref&gt; The selection of elements can vary from play to play and it varies considerably within plays between first and second parabasis</span>
				<span class='text'>The early plays (''The Acharnians'' to ''The Birds'') are fairly uniform in their approach however and the following elements of a parabasis can be found within them</span>
				<span class='text'> '''kommation''': This is a brief prelude, comprising short lines and often including a valediction to the departing actors, such as {{lang|grc|ἴτε χαίροντες}} (Go rejoicing!)</span>
				<span class='text'> '''parabasis proper''': This is usually a defense of the author's work and it includes criticism of the audience's attitude</span>
				<span class='text'>It is declaimed in long lines of 'anapestic tetrameters'</span>
				<span class='text'>Aristophanes himself refers to the parabasis proper only as 'anapests'</span>
				<span class='text'> '''pnigos''': Sometimes known as 'a choker', it comprises a few short lines appended to the parabasis proper as a kind of rapid patter (it has been suggested that some of the effects achieved in a pnigos can be heard in &quot;The Lord Chancellor's Nightmare Song&quot;, in act 2 of Gilbert and Sullivan's ''Iolanthe'')</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Aristophanes Wasps Douglas MacDowell 1978, page 27&quot;&gt;''Aristophanes Wasps'' Douglas MacDowell (ed), Oxford University Press 1978, page 27&lt;/ref&gt;* '''epirrhematic syzygies''': These are symmetrical scenes that mirror each other in meter and number of lines</span>
				<span class='text'>They form part of the first parabasis and they often comprise the entire second parabasis</span>
				<span class='text'>They are characterized by the following elements:** ''strophe'' or ''ode'': These are lyrics in a variety of meters, sung by the Chorus in the first parabasis as an invocation to the gods and as a comic interlude in the second parabasis</span>
				<span class='text'>* ''epirrhema'': These are usually long lines of trochaic tetrameters</span>
				<span class='text'>Broadly political in their significance, they were probably spoken by the leader of the Chorus in character</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: Clouds'' K</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Dover (ed), Oxford University Press 1970, page 126&lt;/ref&gt;** ''antistrophe'' or ''antode'': These are songs that mirror the strophe/ode in meter, length and function</span>
				<span class='text'>* ''antepirrhema''</span>
				<span class='text'>This is another declaimed passage and it mirrors the epirrhema in meter, length and function</span>
				<span class='text'>'[[The Wasps]]'' is thought to offer the best example of a conventional approach&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes:Wasps'' Douglas M</span>
				<span class='text'>acDowell, Oxford University Press 1978, note 1283 page 298&lt;/ref&gt; and the elements of a parabasis can be identified and located in that play as follows</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes Wasps'' Douglas MacDowell (ed), Oxford University Press 1978, pages 298-99&lt;/ref&gt;However, there are several variations from the ideal even within the early plays</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, the parabasis proper in ''The Clouds'' (lines 518-62) is composed in eupolidean meter rather than in anapests&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes:Clouds'' K</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>over, Oxford University Press 1970, page 119 note 518-62&lt;/ref&gt; and the second parabasis includes a kommation but it lacks strophe, antistrophe and antepirrhema (''The Clouds'' lines 1113-30)</span>

				<span class='text'>rg/wiki/%CE%91%CF%87%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%BD%CE%B5%CE%AF%CF%82#970 Wikisource]&lt;/ref&gt; can be considered a hybrid parabasis/song (i</span>

				<span class='text'>]The tragic dramatists, [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]], died near the end of the Peloponnesian War and the art of tragedy thereafter ceased to develop, yet comedy did continue to evolve after the defeat of Athens and it is possible that it did so because, in Aristophanes, it had a master craftsman who lived long enough to help usher it into a new age</span>

				<span class='text'>th Century AD), one of Aristophanes's last plays, ''Aioliskon'', had neither a parabasis nor any choral lyrics (making it a type of Middle Comedy), while ''Kolakos'' anticipated all the elements of New Comedy, including a rape and a recognition scene</span>

				<span class='text'>Knox (eds), Cambridge University Press (1985), page 400&lt;/ref&gt; Aristophanes seems to have had some appreciation of his formative role in the development of comedy, as indicated by his comment in ''Clouds'' that his audience would be judged by other times according to its reception of his plays</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Clouds'' lines 560-62&lt;/ref&gt; ''Clouds'' was awarded third (i</span>

				<span class='text'>over, Oxford University Press 1970, pages XXIX-XXX&lt;/ref&gt; The circulation of his plays in manuscript extended their influence beyond the original audience, over whom in fact they seem to have had little or no practical influence: they did not affect the career of [[Cleon]], they failed to persuade the Athenians to pursue an honourable peace with Sparta and it is not clear that they were instrumental in the trial and execution of Socrates, whose death probably resulted from public animosity towards the philosopher's disgraced associates (such as [[Alcibiades]]),&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: Clouds'' K</span>

				<span class='text'>It is possible that Plato sent copies of the plays to Dionysius of Syracuse so that he might learn about Athenian life and government</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Clouds'' Peter Meineck (translator) and Ian Storey (Introduction), Hackett Publishing 2000, page X&lt;/ref&gt;Latin translations of the plays by [[Andreas Divus]] (Venice 1528) were circulated widely throughout Europe in the Renaissance and these were soon followed by translations and adaptations in modern languages</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Jean Racine|Racine]], for example, drew ''Les Plaideurs'' (1668) from ''The Wasps''</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Goethe]] (who turned to Aristophanes for a warmer and more vivid form of comedy than he could derive from readings of Terence and Plautus) adapted a short play ''Die Vögel'' from ''The Birds'' for performance in Weimar</span>
				<span class='text'>Aristophanes has appealed to both conservatives and radicals in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries&amp;nbsp;— Anatoly Lunacharsky, first Commissar of Enlightenment for the USSR in 1917, declared that the ancient dramatist would have a permanent place in proletarian theatre and yet conservative, Prussian intellectuals interpreted Aristophanes as a satirical opponent of social reform</span>

				<span class='text'>Michael Walton (eds), Cambridge University Press 2007, page 109&lt;/ref&gt;The plays have a significance that goes beyond their artistic function, as historical documents that open the window on life and politics in [[classical Athens]], in which respect they are perhaps as important as the writings of [[Thucydides]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The artistic influence of the plays is immeasurable</span>
				<span class='text'>They have contributed to the history of European theatre and that history in turn shapes our understanding of the plays</span>

				<span class='text'>==Literature===* The [[Romanticism|romantic]] poet, [[Percy Shelley]], wrote a comic, lyrical drama (''Swellfoot the Tyrrant'') in imitation of Aristophanes' play ''The Frogs'' after he was reminded of the Chorus in that play by a herd of pigs passing to market under the window of his lodgings in San Giuliano, Italy</span>
