				<span class='text'>5  The theatres were certainly huge with seating for at least 10ampnbsp000 at the Theatre of Dionysus</span>
				<span class='text'>The days program at the City Dionysia for example was crowded with three tragedies and a  play ahead of a comedy but it is possible that many of the poorer citizens typically the main supporters of  like Cleon occupied the festival holiday with other pursuits</span>
				<span class='text'>The conservative views expressed in the plays might theore lect the attitudes of the dominant group in an unrepresentative audience</span>
				<span class='text'>The production process might also have influenced the views expressed in the plays</span>
				<span class='text'>Throughout most of Aristophanes career the Chorus was essential to a plays success and it was recruited and funded by a  a wealthy citizen appointed to the task by one of the s</span>
				<span class='text'>A choregus could regard his personal expenditure on the Chorus as a civic duty and a public honour but Aristophanes showed in  that wealthy citizens might regard civic responsibilities as punishment imposed on them by demagogues and populists like Cleon</span>

				<span class='text'>or convenience Old Comedy as represented by Aristophanes early plays is analysed below in terms of three broad characteristicsampnbsp— topicality festivity and complexity</span>
				<span class='text'>Dramatic structure contributes to the complexity of Aristophanes plays</span>
				<span class='text'>However it is associated with poetic rhythms and meters that have little relevance to English translations and it is theore treated in a separate section</span>
				<span class='text'>ld Comedys emphasis on real personalities and local issues makes the plays difficult to appreciate today without the aid of scholarly commentariesampnbsp— see for example articles on   and  for lists of topical erences</span>
				<span class='text'>The topicality of the plays had unique consequences for both the writing and the production of the plays in ancient Athens</span>
				<span class='text'>Individual masks All actors in  wore masks but whereas in tragedy and New Comedy these identified stereotypical characters in Old Comedy the masks were often caricatures of real people</span>
				<span class='text'>Perhaps Socrates attracted a lot of attention in Old Comedy because his face lent itself easily to caricature by mask makers</span>
				<span class='text'>ristophanes Lysistrata The Acharnians Clouds A</span>
				<span class='text'>Sommerstein Penguin Classics 1975 page 31  In The Knights we are told that the mask makers were too afraid to make a caricature of Cleon there represented as a Paphlagonian slave but we are assured that the audience is clever enough to identify him anyway</span>
				<span class='text'>nights lines 230 33  The real scene of action Since Old Comedy makes numerous erences to people in the audience the theatre itself was the real scene of action and theatrical illusion was treated as something of a joke</span>

				<span class='text'>Self mocking theatre Frequent parodying of tragedy is an aspect of Old Comedy that modern audiences find difficult to understand</span>
				<span class='text'>But the Lenaia and City Dionysia included performances of both comedies and tragedies and thus erences to tragedy were highly topical and immediately relevant to the original audience</span>

				<span class='text'>ristophanes The Frogs and other Plays David Barrett ed Penguin Classics 1964 page 17  Songs and addresses to the audience by the Chorus gave the actors hardly enough time off stage to draw breath and to prepare for changes in scene</span>
				<span class='text'>Complex structure The action of an Aristophanic play obeyed a crazy logic of its own and yet it always unfolded within a formal dramatic structure that was repeated with minor variations from one play to another</span>
				<span class='text'>The different structural elements are associated with different poetic meters and rhythms and these are generally lost in English translations</span>
				<span class='text'>he structural elements of a typical Aristophanic plot can be summarized as follows prologue   an introductory scene with a dialogue and or soliloquy addressed to the audience expressed in  and explaining the situation that is to be resolved in the play parodos   the arrival of the chorus dancing and singing sometimes followed by a choreographed skirmish with one or more actors often expressed in long lines of tetrameters symmetrical scenes   passages featuring songs and declaimed verses in long lines of tetrameters arranged symmetrically in two sections such that each half resembles the other in meter and line length the agon and parabasis can be considered specific instances of symmetrical scenes parabasis   verses through which the Chorus addresses the audience directly firstly in the middle of the play and again near the end see the section below  agon   a formal debate that decides the outcome of the play typically in anapestic tetrameter though iambs are sometimes used to delineate inferior argumentsAristophanesWasps D</span>

				<span class='text'>he rules of competition did not prevent a playwright arranging and adjusting these elements to suit his particular needs</span>
				<span class='text'>ristophanes Lysistrata The Acharnians The Clouds A</span>
				<span class='text'>Sommerstein Penguin Classics 1975 page 27  In The Acharnians and Peace for example there is no formal agon whereas in The Clouds there are two agons</span>
				<span class='text'>The parabasis is an address to the audience by the chorus or chorus leader while the actors leave or have left the stage</span>
				<span class='text'>In this role the chorus is sometimes out of character as the authors voice and sometimes in character although these capacities are often difficult to distinguish</span>
				<span class='text'>Generally the parabasis occurs somewhere in the middle of a play and often there is a second parabasis towards the end</span>
				<span class='text'>The elements of a parabasis have been defined and named by scholars but it is probable that Aristophanes own understanding was less formal</span>
				<span class='text'>ristophanes Wasps Dougles MacDowell Oxford University Press 1978 page 261  The selection of elements can vary from play to play and it varies considerably within plays between first and second parabasis</span>
				<span class='text'>The early plays The Acharnians to The Birds are fairly uniform in their approach however and the following elements of a parabasis can be found within them</span>
				<span class='text'>kommation This is a brief prelude comprising short lines and often including a valediction to the departing actors such as  Go rejoicing</span>
				<span class='text'>parabasis proper This is usually a defense of the authors work and it includes criticism of the audiences attitude</span>
				<span class='text'>It is declaimed in long lines of anapestic tetrameters</span>
				<span class='text'>Aristophanes himself ers to the parabasis proper only as anapests</span>
				<span class='text'>pnigos Sometimes known as a choker it comprises a few short lines appended to the parabasis proper as a kind of rapid patter it has been suggested that some of the effects achieved in a pnigos can be heard in The Lord Chancellors Nightmare Song in act 2 of Gilbert and Sullivans Iolanthe</span>

				<span class='text'>They are characterized by the following elements strophe or ode These are lyrics in a variety of meters sung by the Chorus in the first parabasis as an invocation to the gods and as a comic interlude in the second parabasis</span>
