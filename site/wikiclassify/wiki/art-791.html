				<span class='text'>arsons developed a general theory for the study of society called [[action theory (sociology)|action theory]], based on the methodological principle of [[Voluntarism (action)|voluntarism]] and the [[epistemological]] principle of [[Analytic philosophy|analytical]] [[Philosophical realism|realism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The theory attempted to establish a balance between two major methodological traditions: the utilitarian-positivist and [[Hermeneutics|hermeneutic]]-idealistic traditions</span>
				<span class='text'>For Parsons, voluntarism established a third alternative between these two</span>
				<span class='text'>More than a theory of society, Parsons presented a theory of social evolution and a concrete interpretation of the &quot;drives&quot; and directions of world history</span>
				<span class='text'>arsons analyzed the work of [[Émile Durkheim]] and [[Vilfredo Pareto]] and evaluated their contributions through the paradigm of voluntaristic action</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons was also largely responsible for introducing and interpreting [[Max Weber]]'s work to American audiences</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he was generally considered a major structuralist functionalist scholar, in an article late in life, Parsons explicitly wrote that the term &quot;functional&quot; or &quot;[[structural functionalist]]&quot; were inappropriate ways to describe the character of his theory</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, &quot;The Present Status of &quot;Structural-Functional&quot; Theory in Sociology</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; In Talcott Parsons, ''Social Systems and The Evolution of Action Theory'' New York: The Free Press, 1975</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons generally agreed with Kingsley Davis' assessment that functional analysis cannot be regarded as an appropriate characterization for any special method or any specific school</span>
				<span class='text'>It is a &quot;technique,&quot; which is far too universal to embody such implications</span>
				<span class='text'>See Kingsley Davis, &quot;The Myth of Functional Aanalysis as a Special Method in Sociology and Anthropology</span>

				<span class='text'>o</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>1959</span>
				<span class='text'>pp</span>
				<span class='text'>757–772</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; For Parsons, &quot;structural functionalism&quot; was a particular stage in the methodological development of the social science, and &quot;functionalism&quot; was a universal method; neither term was a name for any specific school</span>
				<span class='text'>In the same way, the concept &quot;grand theory&quot; is a derogatory term, which Parsons himself never used</span>
				<span class='text'>=Biography==Talcott Parsons was born December 13, 1902 in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was the son of Edward Smith Parsons (1863–1943) and Mary Augusta Ingersoll (1863–1949)</span>
				<span class='text'>His father had attended [[Yale Divinity School]] and was ordained as a [[Congregationalist]] minister, serving first as a minister for a pioneer community in [[Greeley, Colorado]]</span>
				<span class='text'>At the time of Parsons' birth Edward S</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons was a professor in English at [[Colorado College]] and vice-president of the college</span>
				<span class='text'>uring his Congregational ministry in Greeley, Edward S</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons had become sympathetic to the social gospel movement; yet, at the same time, he tended to view this question from a higher theological position and he was hostile to [[socialism]] as a sheer ideology</span>

				<span class='text'>Parsons, &quot;A Christian Critique of Socialism</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; ''Andover Review'' XI</span>
				<span class='text'>1889</span>
				<span class='text'>pp</span>
				<span class='text'>597–611</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Also both Edward S</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons and his son Talcott would be familiar with the theology of [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The father would later become the president of [[Marietta College]] in Ohio</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons' family is one of the oldest families in American history; his ancestors were some of the first to arrive from England in the first half of the 17th century</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Charles Parsons (2004)</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Some remarks on Talcott Parsons’s family&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>In: ''Journal The American Sociologist''</span>
				<span class='text'>Vol 35, Nr 3, Sept 2004</span>
				<span class='text'>pp</span>
				<span class='text'>4–22</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The family's heritage consisted of two separate and independently developed Parsons lines, which both went back to the early days of America and indeed deeper into British history</span>
				<span class='text'>On the father's side the family could be traced back to the Parsons of [[York, Maine]]</span>
				<span class='text'>On the mother's side, the Ingersoll line was connected with [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]] and from Edwards on there would be a new independent Parsons line because his eldest daughter Sarah married Elihu Parsons on June 11, 1750</span>
				<span class='text'>==Studies: Amherst College===As an undergraduate, Parsons studied biology, sociology and philosophy at [[Amherst College]] and received his B</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>in 1924</span>
				<span class='text'>Amherst College had become the Parsons' family college by tradition; his father and his uncle Frank had attended it, as had his older brother</span>
				<span class='text'>Initially Parsons was attracted to a career in medicine, inspired in this direction by his older brother Charles Edward Parsons, so he studied a great deal of biology and spent a summer working at the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution|Oceanographic Institution]] at [[Woods Hole, Massachusetts]]</span>
				<span class='text'>arsons' biology teachers while at Amherst were [[Otto C</span>
				<span class='text'>Glaser]] and Henry Plough</span>
				<span class='text'>Gently mocked as &quot;Little Talcott, the gilded cherub&quot;, Parsons became one of the student leaders at Amherst</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons also took courses with Walton Hamilton and the philosopher [[Clarence Edwin Ayres]], both known as &quot;institutional economists&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>They exposed him to literature by [[Thorstein Veblen]], [[John Dewey]], and [[William Graham Sumner]], among others</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons also took a course with George Brown in the philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]], and a course in modern German philosophy with Otto Manthey-Zorn, who was a great Kant interpreter</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons showed from early on a great interest in the topic of [[philosophy]], which most likely was an echo of his father's great interest in [[theology]] in the tradition of which he had been profoundly socialized, a position that contrasted with his teachers' view</span>
				<span class='text'>wo term papers Parsons wrote as a student for Clarence E</span>
				<span class='text'>Ayres' class in Philosophy III at Amherst have survived</span>
				<span class='text'>These are referred to as the Amherst Papers and have been of strong interest to Parsons scholars</span>
				<span class='text'>The first is written on December 19, 1922, and is called &quot;The Theory of Human Behavior in its Individual and Social Aspects</span>

				<span class='text'>'&lt;/ref&gt; The Amherst Papers also reveal that Parsons did not agree with his institutionalist teachers, since he writes in the Amherst papers that technological development and moral progress are two structurally independent empirical processes</span>
				<span class='text'>==Studies: London School of Economics===After Amherst, he studied at the [[London School of Economics]] for a year, where he was exposed to the work of [[R</span>
				<span class='text'>H</span>
				<span class='text'>Tawney]], [[Bronisław Malinowski]], and [[Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse]]</span>
				<span class='text'>During his days at LSE he made friends with [[E</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Evans-Pritchard]], [[Meyer Fortes]] and Raymonth Firth, who all participated in the Malinowski seminar and in addition, he made a close personal friendship with Arthur and [[Eveline M</span>
				<span class='text'>Burns|Eveline Burns]]</span>
				<span class='text'>hile studying at LSE he met a young American girl in the students common room by the name of Helen Bancroft Walker whom he married on April 30, 1927</span>
				<span class='text'>The couple had three children, Anne, Charles and Susan and eventually four grandchildren</span>
				<span class='text'>Walker's father was born in Canada but had moved to the Boston area and had become a naturalized American citizen</span>
				<span class='text'>==Studies: University of Heidelberg===Parsons went on to the [[Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg|University of Heidelberg]], where he received his Ph</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>in sociology and economics</span>
				<span class='text'>During his time in Heidelberg, he worked with [[Alfred Weber]] ([[Max Weber]]'s brother), [[Edgar Salin]] (who was his dissertation adviser) Emil Lederer, and [[Karl Mannheim]] and in addition he was examined in Immanuel Kant's &quot;Critique of pure Reason&quot; by the philosopher [[Karl Jaspers]]</span>

				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt; At Heidelberg Parsons was also examed by Willy Andreas in the French Revolution</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons wrote his Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>phil</span>
				<span class='text'>thesis on ''The Concept of Capitalism in the Recent German Literature'' with his main focus on the work of [[Werner Sombart]] and [[Max Weber]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It was clear from his discussion that he rejected Sombart's quasi-idealistic views and was in favor of Weber's attempt to strike a balance between &quot;[[historicism]]&quot;, &quot;[[idealism]]&quot; and a [[Neo-Kantian]] approach</span>
				<span class='text'>he most crucial encounter for Parsons at Heidelberg was his encounter with the work of [[Max Weber]], who he never had heard about before he arrived</span>
				<span class='text'>Weber became tremendously important for Parsons because given his upbringing with a liberal yet strongly religious father, the question of the role of culture and religion in the basic processes of world history had been a persistent puzzle in his mind</span>
				<span class='text'>Weber was the first scholar who truly provided Parsons with a compelling theoretical &quot;answer&quot; to this question and Parsons became absorbed in the reading of Weber to the utmost extent</span>
				<span class='text'>arsons decided among other things that he would like to translate Weber's work into English and approached [[Marianne Weber]], Max Weber's wife in this regard and he would eventually translate several of Weber's works into English</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; During his time in Heidelberg Parsons was invited by Marianne Weber to &quot;sociological teas,&quot; which were study group meetings Marianne held in the library room of her and Max Weber's old apartment</span>
				<span class='text'>One scholar Parsons met at Heidelberg who shared his enthusiasm for Weber was Alexander von Schelting</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons later wrote a review article on von Schelting's book on Weber</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, &quot;Review of Max Webers Wissenschaftslehre, by Alexander von Schelting,&quot; ''American Sociological Review'' vol</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>1936: 675–81</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Generally, Parsons read extensively in religious literature, especially works focusing on the sociology of religion</span>
				<span class='text'>One scholar who became especially important for Parsons in this regard was Ernst D</span>
				<span class='text'>Troeltsch (1865–1923)</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons also read widely on the topic of [[Calvinism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His reading included the work of Emile Doumerque,&lt;ref&gt;Emile Doumerque, ''Jean Calvin: Les hommes et les choses de son temps,'' 7 volumes</span>
				<span class='text'>Lausanne, 1899–1927</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Eugéne Choisy and Henri Hauser</span>
				<span class='text'>==Instructor at Harvard Department of Economics, 1927===In 1927, after a year teaching at Amherst (1926–27), Parsons entered Harvard as an instructor in the Department of Economics,&lt;ref&gt;Edward S</span>
				<span class='text'>Mason, &quot;The Harvard Department of Economics from the Beginning to World War II</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'' 97</span>
				<span class='text'>1982</span>
				<span class='text'>pp</span>
				<span class='text'>383–433</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; where he followed F</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Taussig's lectures on [[Alfred Marshall]] and became friends with the economist historian [[Edwin Gay]], who was the founder of [[Harvard Business School]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons also became a close associate of [[Joseph Schumpeter]] and followed his course on &quot;General Economics&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons was generally at odds with some of the trends in Harvard's Economics department which in those days went in a highly technical, mathematical direction, and Parsons looked for other options at Harvard and gave courses in &quot;Social Ethics&quot; and in the &quot;Sociology of Religion</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Although Parsons entered Harvard through the Economics Department, he never aimed at becoming an economist; all his activities and his basic intellectual interest propelled him toward [[Sociology]], although no Sociology Department existed in the first years at the time at Harvard</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Harvard was in these years working toward establishing a Sociology Department and Parsons positioned himself in various ways through writing and teaching obligations so he was ready to join a Sociology Department, when it finally was established</span>
				<span class='text'>In contrast to legend Parsons was never &quot;forced&quot; out of the Economics Department, his exit was voluntary and a deliberate decision</span>
				<span class='text'>==Harvard's first Sociology Department, 1931===The chance for a shift to [[sociology]] came in 1931, when Harvard's first Sociology Department was created under the Russian scholar [[Pitirim Sorokin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Sorokin, who had fled the Russian Revolution and had emigrated from Russia to the United States in 1923, was given the opportunity to establish the department</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons became one of the new department's two instructors, along with Carl Joslyn</span>
				<span class='text'>During this period Parsons established close ties with [[biochemist]] and sociologist [[Lawrence Joseph Henderson]], who took personal interest in Parsons' career at Harvard</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons became part of L</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Henderson's famous [[Vilfredo Pareto]] study group in which some of the most important intellectuals at Harvard participated, including [[Crane Brinton]], [[George C</span>
				<span class='text'>Homans]], and [[Charles P</span>
				<span class='text'>Curtis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons wrote an article on Pareto's theory&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, &quot;Pareto's Central Analytical Scheme</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; In Talcott Parsons, ''The Early Essays'' Edited C</span>
				<span class='text'>Camic</span>
				<span class='text'>Chicago: [[University of Chicago Press]], 1991</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and later explained that he had adopted the concept of &quot;social system&quot; from his reading of Pareto</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons also made strong connections with two other influential intellectuals with whom he corresponded for years; one was economist [[Frank H</span>
				<span class='text'>Knight]] and the other was Chester I</span>
				<span class='text'>Barnard, one of US's most dynamic business-men at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>The relationship between Parsons and Sorokin quickly ran sour</span>
				<span class='text'>A pattern of personal tensions was aggravated by Sorokin's deep dislike for American civilization, which he regarded as a sensate culture in decline</span>
				<span class='text'>Sorokin's writings became increasingly anti-scientistic in his later years, widening the gulf between his work and Parsons', and turning the increasingly positivisitic American sociology community against him</span>
				<span class='text'>Sorokin also tended to belittle all other sociology tendencies than his own writings and by 1934 the perception of Sorokin at Harvard had already turned quite negative</span>
				<span class='text'>ome of Parsons' students in the first years of the new department of Sociology were people like Robin Williams Jr</span>
				<span class='text'> [[Robert K</span>
				<span class='text'>Merton]], Kingsley Davis, Wilbert Moore, Edward C</span>
				<span class='text'>Devereux, Logan Wilson, Nicholas Demereth, John Riley, Jr</span>
				<span class='text'>and Mathilda White Riley</span>
				<span class='text'>Later cohorts of students, included among others Harry Johnson, Bernard Barber, Marion Levy and [[Jesse R</span>
				<span class='text'>Pitts]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons established, at the students' request, a little informal study group which met year after year in Adams house</span>
				<span class='text'>Toward the end of Parsons' career, the German systems theorist [[Niklas Luhmann]] also attended his lectures</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1932 Parsons bought his famous farmhouse in [[New Hampshire]] for $2</span>
				<span class='text'>00</span>
				<span class='text'>The farmhouse was located in a wooden area near the small town of [[Acworth, New Hampshire|Acworth]], although Parsons often in his writing referred to it as &quot;the farmhouse in [[Alstead, New Hampshire|Alstead]]</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The farmhouse was not big and impressive; indeed, it was a very humble structure with almost no modern utilities</span>
				<span class='text'>The farmhouse became central to Parsons' life, and many of his most important works were written in the peace and quiet at the farmhouse</span>
				<span class='text'>n the spring of 1933, Susan Kingsbury, a pioneer of women's rights in America, wrote to Parsons and offered him a position at [[Bryn Mawr College|Bryn Mawr]]; however, Parsons declined the offer because, as he wrote to Kingsbury, &quot;neither salary nor rank is really definitely above what I enjoy here</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In the academic year of 1939-40 Talcott Parsons and [[Joseph Schumpeter]] conducted an informal faculty seminar at Harvard, which met in Emerson Hall and discussed the concept of [[rationality]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Among the participants in the seminary were D</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>McGranahan, Abram Bergson, [[Wassily Leontief]], [[Gottfried Haberler]], and [[Paul Sweezy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Schumpeter contributed with the essay &quot;Rationality in Economics&quot; to the seminar, while Parsons submitted the paper &quot;The Role of Rationality in Social Action&quot; for a general discussion</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See, Robert Loring Allen, ''Opening Doors: The Life and Work of Joseph Schumpeter Vol 2: America</span>

				<span class='text'>p</span>
				<span class='text'>98</span>
				<span class='text'>An edited version of Schumpeter's paper to the seminary was published in ''Zeitschrift für die gesamte Staatswissenschaft</span>

				<span class='text'>no</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>December 1984: 577–93</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Schumpeter suggested that he and Parsons write or edit a book together on the topic of rationality but the project never materialized</span>
				<span class='text'>==Neoclassical economics versus institutionalists===In the prevailing discussion between [[neoclassical economics]] and the [[institutional economics|institutionalists]], which was one of the conflicts that prevailed within the field of economics in the 1920s and early 1930s, Parsons attempted to walk a very fine line</span>
				<span class='text'>Put briefly, he was very critical about neo-classical theory and this was an attitude that prevailed all the way through his life and is reflected in his critique of [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Gary Becker]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was opposed to the utilitarian bias within the neo-classical approach, not in the sense that he discredited everything the neoclassical economists said, but to the effect that he could not embrace them fully</span>
				<span class='text'>However, he agreed generally (or at least up to a point) on their theoretical and methodological style of approach (which should be discriminated from its substance)</span>
				<span class='text'>For the same reasons (and for several other reasons in addition) he was unable to accept the institutionalist solution</span>
				<span class='text'>In an interview late in life Parsons recalled his conversation with [[Joseph Schumpeter]] about the institutionalist methodological position, the following way: &quot;An economist like Schumpeter, by contrast, would absolutely have none of that</span>
				<span class='text'>I remember talking to him about the problem and </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>I think Schumpeter was right</span>
				<span class='text'>If economics had gone that way [like the institutionalists] it would have had to become a primarily empirical discipline, largely descriptive, and without theoretical focus</span>
				<span class='text'>That's the way the 'institutionalists' went, and of course Mitchell ([[Wesley Mitchell]]) was affiliated with that movement</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Second period in Germany and the fight against Nazism===Parsons revisited Germany in the summer of 1930 and became a direct eye-witness to the feverish atmosphere in [[Weimar Republic|Weimar Germany]] during which the [[Nazi Party]] rose to power</span>
				<span class='text'>In the following period Parsons received constant reports about the rise of [[Nazism]] through his friend [[Edward Y</span>
				<span class='text'>Hartshorne]] who was travelling in Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons began in the late 1930s to warn the American public about the Nazi threat; this was not an easy task since US in those days was predominantly isolationist</span>
				<span class='text'>ne of the first articles Parsons wrote in this regard was entitled: &quot;New Dark Age Seen If Nazis Should Win</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Parsons became one of the key initiators of the Harvard Defense Committee, an organization aimed at rallying the American public against the Nazis</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons' voice would sound again and again over Boston's local radio-stations as a part of this campaign</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons also spoke against Nazism during a dramatic meeting at Harvard campus which was disturbed by isolationist activists</span>
				<span class='text'>To fight [[isolationism]] early in World War II was a very difficult task since polls showed that 91 percent of the population was unwilling to go to war for the allied cause</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Together with graduate student [[Charles O</span>
				<span class='text'>Porter]], Parsons would rally graduate students at Harvard for the war effort</span>
				<span class='text'>(Porter would later become a US Congressman for Oregon elected on a Democratic ticket</span>
				<span class='text'> During the War Parsons conducted a special study group at Harvard, which analyzed what its members considered the causes of Nazism and where leading experts on the topic participated</span>
				<span class='text'>==1940s: The Second World War and the Harvard School of Overseas Administration===In the spring of 1941 a discussion group on Japan began to meet at Harvard</span>
				<span class='text'>The group's five core members were Talcott Parsons, [[John K</span>
				<span class='text'>Fairbank]], [[Edwin O</span>
				<span class='text'>Reischauer]], William M</span>
				<span class='text'>McGovern and [[Marion Levy, Jr</span>
				<span class='text'>]</span>
				<span class='text'>A few others would also occasionally join the group including Ai-Li Sung (Ai-Li Sung Chin) and Edward Y</span>
				<span class='text'>Hartshorne</span>
				<span class='text'>The group rose out of a strong desire to understand [[Japan]] whose power in the East had grown tremendously (while at the same time allied with Nazi Germany since November 1936) but as Levy frankly admit &quot;Reischauer was the only one who knew anything about Japan</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Parsons, however, was eager to learn more about Japan and was &quot;concerned with general implications</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Shortly after the Japanese attack on [[Pearl Harbor]], Parsons wrote in a letter to [[Arthur Upham Pope]] (1881–1969) that the importance of studies of Japan certainly had intensified</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; but this initiative never materialized because of lack of funding</span>
				<span class='text'>In early 1942 Parsons approached Hartshorne, who had joined the Psychology Division of the Office of the Coordinator of Information (COI) in Washington, DC to interest his agency in the research project but without result</span>
				<span class='text'>In February 1943, Parsons became the deputy director of Harvard School of Overseas administration, a school which educated administrators to &quot;run&quot; the occupied territories in Germany and the Pacific</span>
				<span class='text'>The task of finding relevant literature on both Europe and Asia for the Harvard School of Oversea administration (ASOA) was mind-boggling and occupied a fair amount of Parsons' time</span>
				<span class='text'>One scholar Parsons came to know in his period was [[Karl August Wittfogel]] with whom he discussed [[Max Weber]] and whom he asked to lecture at the ASOA</span>
				<span class='text'>On the issue of China, which also was taught at the school, Parsons received fundamental information from Chinese scholar Ai-Li Sung Chin and her husband Robert Chin</span>
				<span class='text'>Another Chinese scholar Parsons worked closely with during the ASOA period was Hsiao-Tung Fei (also written: Fei Xiaotong) (1910–2005) who had studied at the London School of Economics and who was an expert on the social structure of the Chinese village</span>
				<span class='text'>==1940s: Intellectual exchange with Schutz, Voegelin, Dodd and other debates===Parsons met [[Alfred Schutz]] (Schütz) during the rationality seminar, which he conducted jointly together with Joseph Schumpeter at Harvard in the spring of 1940</span>
				<span class='text'>Schutz has been close to [[Edmund Husserl]] and was deeply embedded in his phenomenological philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Alfred Schutz's phenomenology is not a simple &quot;copy&quot; of Husserl yet it is still pretty close; how close is a debated issues</span>

				<span class='text'>December 1984</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Schutz who had been born in Vienna and had moved to the US in 1939, had for years worked on the project of developing a [[Phenomenological Sociology|phenomenological sociology]] primarily based on an attempt to find some fixpoint between Husserl's method and Weber's sociology</span>

				<span class='text'>' Northwestern University Press, 1967</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Parsons had asked Schutz to give a presentation at the rationality seminar, which he did on April 13, 1940, and Parsons and Schutz had lunched together afterward</span>
				<span class='text'>Schutz was fascinated with Parsons' theory, which he regarded as the state-of-the-art of social theory and he had written an evaluation of Parsons' theory which he kindly asked Parsons to comment on</span>
				<span class='text'>This led to a short but intensive correspondence, which generally revealed that the gap between Schutz's sociologized phenomenology and Parsons concept of voluntaristic action was far too great</span>

				<span class='text'> ''The Correspondence between Alfred Schutz and Talcott Parsons: The Theory of Social Action</span>
				<span class='text'>' Bloomington and London: Indiana University Press, 1978 (German version, 1977)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; From Parsons' point of view Schutz's position was too speculative and subjectivist of nature and he felt that Schutz was essentially a philosopher, who tended to reduce social processes to the articulation of a Lebenswelt consciousness, while for Parsons the defining edge of human life was action as a catalyst for historical change</span>
				<span class='text'>For Parsons it was essential that sociology as a science should pay strong attention to the subjective element of action but it should never become completely absorbed in it, since the purpose of a science was to explain causal relationships, whether by covering laws or by other types of explanatory devices</span>
				<span class='text'>Schutz's basic argument was that sociology cannot ground itself and that [[epistemology]] was not a luxury but a necessity for the social scientist</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons agreed but stressed the pragmatic need to demarcate science and philosophy and insisted moreover that the grounding of a conceptual scheme for empirical theory construction cannot aim at absolute solutions but need to take a sensible stock-taking of the epistemological balance at each point in time</span>
				<span class='text'>However, there is no doubt that the two men shared many basic assumptions about the nature of social theory, which has kept the debate simmering ever since</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Parsons had probably met Voegelin during 1938-39 when Voegelin held a temporary instructor appointment at Harvard</span>
				<span class='text'>The bouncing point for their conversation was Parsons´' manuscript on anti-Semitism and other materials Parsons had sent to Voegelin</span>
				<span class='text'>The discussion touched on the nature of [[capitalism]], the rise of the West and the origin of [[Nazism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The key to this discussion was the implication of Max Weber's interpretation of the [[Protestant ethic]]s and the impact of [[Calvinism]] on modern history</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the two scholars agreed on many fundamental characteristics about Calvinism, their understanding of its historical impact was quite different</span>
				<span class='text'>Generally, Voegelin regarded Calvinism as essentially a dangerous totalitarian [[ideology]]; Parsons argued that these features of [[Calvinism]] was temporary and that the functional implications of its long-term, emerging [[value-system]] had revolutionary and by no means simply &quot;negative&quot; impact on the general rise of the institutions of modernity</span>
				<span class='text'>The two scholars also discussed Parsons' debate with [[Alfred Schutz]] (Schütz) and especially why Parsons had ended his encounter with Schutz</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons found that Schutz rather than attempting to build social science theory tended to get consumed in philosophical detours</span>
				<span class='text'>In this regard Parsons wrote to Voegelin: &quot;Possibly one of my troubles in my discussion with Schuetz lies in the fact that by cultural heritage I am a Calvinist</span>
				<span class='text'>I do not want to be a philosopher – I shy away from the philosophical problems underlying my scientific work</span>
				<span class='text'>By the same token I don't think he wants to be a scientist as I understand the term until he has settled all the underlying philosophical difficulties</span>
				<span class='text'>If the physicists of the 17th century had been Schuetzes there might well have been no Newtonian system</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Parsons acknowledge Dodd's contribution to be an exceedingly formidable work but at the same time he argued against its premises as a general paradigm for the [[social sciences]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons generally argued that Dodd's &quot;S-theory,&quot; which included the so-called &quot;social distance&quot; scheme of Bogardus, was unable to construct a sufficiently sensitive and systematized theoretical matrix, compared with the &quot;traditional&quot; approach, which has developed around the lines of [[Max Weber]], [[Vilfredo Pareto]], Émile Durkheim, [[Sigmund Freud]], [[W</span>
				<span class='text'>I</span>
				<span class='text'>Thomas|William Isaac Thomas]], and other important agents of an action-system approach with a more clear dialogue with the cultural and motivational dimensions of human interaction</span>
				<span class='text'>n April 1944, Parsons participated in the conference &quot;On Germany after the war,&quot; which was a conference of psychoanalytical oriented psychiatrists and a few social scientists with the aim of analyzing the causes of [[Nazism]] and to discuss the principles for the coming occupation</span>

				<span class='text'>Kubie's reductionism</span>
				<span class='text'>Lawrence S</span>
				<span class='text'>Kubie was a psychoanalyst who strongly argued that the German national character was completely &quot;destructive&quot; and that it would be necessary for a special agency of the United Nation to control the German educational system directly</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons and many others at the conference were strongly opposed to Kubie's idea</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons argued that such an enterprise certainly would fail and he suggested that Kubie was viewing the question of German's reorientation &quot;too exclusively in psychiatric terms</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Parsons was also against the [[Morgenthau plan]], which was aired in September 1944</span>

				<span class='text'>They investigated ethnic and racial tensions in the [[Boston]] area between students from [[Radcliffe College]] and [[Wellesley College]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This study was a reaction to the upsurge of [[antisemitism]] in the Boston area, which began in late 1943 and continued into 1944</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; At the end of November 1946, the Social Research Council (SSRC) asked Parsons to write a comprehensive report of the topic of how the social sciences could contribute to the understanding of the modern world</span>

				<span class='text'>Parsons' report in form of a large memorandum called &quot;Social Science: A Basic National Resource&quot; became available in July 1948 and remains a powerful historical statement about how Talcott Parsons saw the role of the modern [[Social Sciences]]</span>

				<span class='text'>==Against Communism===Parsons' fight against [[Communism]] was a natural extension of his fight against [[fascism]] in the 1930s and 1940s</span>
				<span class='text'>For Parsons, communism and fascism were two aspects of the same problem; they both represented what Parsons in his discussion in his article &quot;A Tentative Outline of American Values&quot; (posthum, 1989)&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, &quot;A Tentative Outline of American Values&quot; in Roland Robertson &amp; [[Bryan S</span>

				<span class='text'> ''Talcott Parsons: Theorist of Modernity</span>
				<span class='text'>'London: Sage Publication, 1991</span>
				<span class='text'>The article &quot;A Tentative Outline of the American Value System&quot; was written in 1959 or 1960 and can be seen as a kind of prelude of Parsons' long-term interest in writing a major work about American Society, which at the same time was an attempt to facilitate the theoretical fundament of the concept of the &quot;societal community,&quot; which represented the I-factor (the integrative function) of the social system and which extreme importance lied in the fact that Parsons in a sense regarded it as the epi-center (or the logical &quot;starting-point&quot;) of the general process of differentiation in (and of) society</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; called collectivistic types of &quot;empirical finalism,&quot; which he believed was a secular &quot;mirror&quot; of religious types of &quot;salvationalism</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; In contrast, Parsons highlighted that American values generally were based on the principle of &quot;instrumental activism,&quot; which he believed was the outcome of [[Puritanism]] as a historical process</span>
				<span class='text'>It representing what Parsons called &quot;[[Asceticism|worldly asceticism]]&quot; and in that capacity, it represented the absolute opposite principle of empirical finalism</span>
				<span class='text'>It is also in this light one shall understand Parsons' statement late in life that the greatest threat to Mankind was that of &quot;[[fundamentalism]]&quot; in whatever form</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; By the term &quot;empirical finalism&quot; Parsons implied the type of claim assessed by cultural and ideological actors about the correct or &quot;final&quot; ends of particular patterns of value-orientation in the actual historical world (such as the notion of &quot;a truly just society&quot;) which was absolutist and &quot;indisputable&quot; in its manner of declaration and in its function as a belief system</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, the Jacobins behavior during the French Revolution would be a typical example of &quot;empirical finalism</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Parsons' rejection of communist and fascist totalitarianism was both theoretically and intellectually an integral part of his theory of world history, where Parsons tended to regard the European Reformation as the most crucial event in &quot;modern&quot; world history and where he like Max Weber&lt;ref&gt;Max Weber, ''The Protestant Ethics and the Spirit of Capitalism'' Roxbury Publishing Company, 2002</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; tended to highlight the crucial impact of Calvinist religiosity in the socio-political and socio-economic processes, which followed;&lt;ref&gt;Jens Kaalhauge Nielsen, &quot;Are there Cultural Limits to Inclusion?

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===American exceptionalism===Parsons defended the notion of [[American exceptionalism]], and argued that because of a variety of historical circumstances, the impact of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] had reached a certain intensity in the [[history of Great Britain]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Puritan, essentially Calvinist, value-patterns had become institutionalized within the internal situation there</span>
				<span class='text'>The outcome was that Puritan radicalism was reflected in the religious radicalism of the Puritan sects, in the poetry of [[John Milton]], in the [[English Civil War]] and in the process coming to a head in the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688</span>
				<span class='text'>It was the radical fling of [[Puritan revolution]] which provided settlers in early seventeenth-century [[colonial America]], and the Puritans who settled in America represented the radical wing with regard to ideals of individuality, [[egalitarianism]], skepticism toward state power and the zeal of the religious calling</span>
				<span class='text'>These settlers established something unique in the world, under the religious zeal of Calvinist values</span>
				<span class='text'>herefore, a new kind of nation was born, the character of which became clear by the time of the [[American Revolution]] and in the [[United States Constitution|American constitution]] of 1787,&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, ''American Society: A Theory of Societal Community</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The [[French Revolution]] was an attempt to copy the American model, but it was essentially a process that failed</span>
				<span class='text'>Although America has changed in its social composition since 1787, it preserves, Parsons maintained, the basic revolutionary Calvinist value-pattern</span>
				<span class='text'>This development has been further revealed in the pluralist and highly individualized America with its thick, network-oriented [[civil society]], which is of crucial importance to America's success, and these factors have provided the United States with its historical lead in the industrialized process</span>
				<span class='text'>his momentum, Parsons maintained, has continued to place the United States in the leading position in the world, but as a historical process and not in &quot;the nature of things&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons viewed the &quot;highly special feature of the modern Western social world&quot; as &quot;dependent on the peculiar circumstances of its history, and not the necessary universal result of social development as a whole</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; he did not believe in the past as a lost &quot;golden age,&quot; but rather maintained that modernity generally had improved the conditions of Man, admittedly often in troublesome and painful ways, yet in sum mankind's condition has generally progressed</span>
				<span class='text'>In this way he had faith in Man, not naively but still believing in human beings' potentials</span>
				<span class='text'>When asked at the Brown seminary in 1973, whether he was optimistic about the future, he answered, &quot;Oh, I think I'm basically optimistic about the human prospects in the long run</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Parsons pointed out that he was student at [[Heidelberg]] at the height of the vogue of [[Oswald Spengler]], the author of ''Der Untergang des Abenlandes'' &quot;and he didn't give the West more than 50 years of continuing vitality after the time he wrote </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Well, its more than 50 years later now, and I don't think the West has just simply declined</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Harvard Department of Social Relations, 1946===At Harvard, Parsons was instrumental in forming the [[Harvard Department of Social Relations|Department of Social Relations]], an interdisciplinary venture among sociology, anthropology, and psychology</span>
				<span class='text'>The new department was officially created in January 1946 with Talcott Parsons as the chairman and with prominent figures at the faculty such as Samuel Stouffer, [[Clyde Kluckhohn]], [[Henry Murray]] and [[Gordon Allport]]</span>
				<span class='text'>An appointment for Hartshorne was considered but came to a bloody end, when Hartshorne was killed in Germany by an unknown gunman while driving on the highway</span>
				<span class='text'>His position went instead to [[George C</span>
				<span class='text'>Homans]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The new department was galvanized by Parsons' idea of creating a theoretical and institutional base for a unified social science</span>
				<span class='text'>During this period Parsons also became strongly interested in systems theory and cybernetics and began to adopt their basic ideas and concepts to the realm of social science, especially the work of [[Norbert Wiener]] (1894–1964) had his attention</span>
				<span class='text'>ome of the students who arrived at the Department of Social Relations in the years after the Second World War were: David Aberle, Gardner Lindzey, [[Harold Garfinkel]], [[David G</span>
				<span class='text'>Hays]], Benton Johnson, Marian Johnson, Kaspar Naegele, James Olds, Albert Cohen, Norman Birnbaum, Jackson Toby, [[Robert Bellah]], Joseph Kahl, [[Joseph Berger (sociologist)|Joseph Berger]], Morris Zelditch, [[Renee Fox]], Tom O'Dea, [[Ezra Vogel]], [[Clifford Geertz]], Joseph Elder, Theodore Mills, Mark Field and Francis Sutton</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Renee Fox]], who arrived at Harvard in 1949, would become a very close, personal friend of the Parsons family</span>
				<span class='text'>Joseph Berger, who also arrived at Harvard in 1949, after finishing his B</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>from [[Brooklyn College]], would become Parsons' research assistant in the year 1952-53 and would get involved in Parsons' research projects with Robert F</span>
				<span class='text'>Bales</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to Parsons' own account, it was during his conversations with [[Elton Mayo]] (1880–1949) that he realized it was necessary for him to take a serious look at the work of Freud</span>
				<span class='text'>In the fall of 1938 Parsons began to offer a series of non-credit evening courses on [[Sigmund Freud]]</span>
				<span class='text'>As time passed, Parsons developed a strong interest in [[psychoanalysis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He volunteered to participate in non-therapeutic training at the Boston Psychoanalytic Institute, where he began a didactic analysis with Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Grete Bibring in September 1946</span>
				<span class='text'>Insight into psychoanalysis is significantly reflected in his later work, especially reflected in ''The Social System'' and in his general writing on psychological issues and on the theory of socialization</span>
				<span class='text'>This influence was also to some extent apparent in his empirical analysis of fascism during the war</span>
				<span class='text'>Beside the work of Freud, also [[Wolfgang Köhler]]'s study of the mentality of apes and [[Kurt Koffka]]'s ideas of [[Gestalt Psychology]] had Parsons attention</span>
				<span class='text'>==''The Social System'' and ''Toward a General Theory of Action''===During the late 1940s and early 1950s Parsons worked very hard on producing some major theoretical statements</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1951 Parsons published two major theoretical works, ''The Social System''&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, ''The Social System</span>
				<span class='text'>' New York: The Free Press, 1951</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and ''Toward a General Theory of Action</span>
				<span class='text'>'&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons &amp; Edward Shils (eds</span>
				<span class='text'> ''Toward a General Theory of Action</span>
				<span class='text'>' Cambridge, Mass</span>
				<span class='text'> [[Harvard University Press]], 1951</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The latter work which was coauthored with [[Edward Tolman]], Edward Shils and several others, was the outcome of the so-called Carnegie Seminar, which had taken place in the period of September 1949 and January 1950</span>
				<span class='text'>''The Social System'' represented Parsons first major attempt to present his basic outline of a general theory of society, since ''[[The Structure of Social Action]]'' (1937) can be regarded as the work, where he discussed the basic methodological and meta-theoretical principles for such a theory</span>
				<span class='text'>The Social system attempted to present a general social system theory build systematically from it most basic premises and hence, it featured the idea of an interaction situation based on need-dispositions and facilitated through the basic concepts of cognitive, cathectic and evaluative orientation</span>
				<span class='text'>By the same token the work also became known for the place, where Parsons introduced his famous pattern variables, which in reality represented choices distributed along a Gemeinschaft versus Gesellschaft axis</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the way Parsons' thought about the outline of the social system went through a rapid series of re-editing processes in the following years although the basic core remained</span>
				<span class='text'>During the early 1950s the idea of the AGIL model took stepwise place in Parsons mind</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Parsons the key idea to the AGIL scheme was sparked during Parsons' work with Robert F</span>
				<span class='text'>Bales on the study of motivational processes in small groups</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, Robert F</span>
				<span class='text'>Bales &amp; Edward A</span>
				<span class='text'>Shils (eds</span>
				<span class='text'> ''Working Papers in The Theory of Action</span>
				<span class='text'>' New York: The Free Press, 1953</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Parsons carried this idea into the major work he coauthored with his student [[Neil Smelser]], which was published in 1956 with the title ''Economy and Society,''&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons &amp; Neil J</span>
				<span class='text'>Smelser, ''Economy and Society</span>
				<span class='text'>' London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1956</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; where the first rudimentary model of the AGIL scheme was presented</span>
				<span class='text'>The AGIL scheme reorganized the basic concepts of the pattern variables in a new way and presented the solution within a system-theoretical approach using the idea of a cybernetic hierarchy as an organizing principle</span>
				<span class='text'>The real innovation in the AGIL model was the concept of the &quot;latent function&quot; or the pattern maintenance function, which became the crucial key to the whole cybernetic hierarchy</span>
				<span class='text'>uring this theoretical development Parsons showed a persistent interest in [[symbol]]ism</span>
				<span class='text'>An important statement in this regard was Parsons' article &quot;The theory of symbolism in relation to action</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, &quot;The theory of symbolism in relation to action</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; In Talcott Parsons, Robert F</span>

				<span class='text'>Shils, ''Working Papers in the Theory of Action</span>
				<span class='text'>' New York: The Free Press, 1953</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This article was stimulated by a series of informal discussion group meetings, which Parsons and several other colleagues in the spring of 1951 had conducted with philosopher and semiotician [[Charles W</span>
				<span class='text'>Morris]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Charles W</span>
				<span class='text'>Morris, ''Signs, Language and Behavior</span>
				<span class='text'>' New York: Prentice-Hall, 1946</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Parsons interest in symbolism went hand in hand with his interest in Freud's theory and the paper &quot;The Superego and the Theory of Social Systems,&quot; written in May 1951, for the meeting of the American Psychiatric Association can be regarded as a main statement of his own Freud interpretation&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, &quot;The Superego and the Theory of Social Systems</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; In Talcott Parsons, Robert F</span>
				<span class='text'>Bales &amp; Edward A</span>
				<span class='text'>Shils, ''Working Papers in the Theory of Action</span>
				<span class='text'>' New York: The Free Press, 1953</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; but also as a statement how Parsons tried to use Freud's pattern of symbolization as a way to structure the theory of social system and eventually a way in which to codify the cybernetic hierarchy of the AGIL system within the parameter of a system of symbolic differentiation</span>
				<span class='text'>His discussion of [[Sigmund Freud]] also contains several layers of criticism, which reveal that Parsons use of Freud is selective rather than orthodox</span>
				<span class='text'>Especially he highlights in his critique of Freud that &quot;Freud introduced an unreal separation between the superego and the ego</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;===Subscriber to system-theory, early 1950s===Parsons was an early subscriber to system-theory</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons had from early on been fascinated by the writing of [[Walter B</span>
				<span class='text'>Cannon]] and his concept of homeostasis,&lt;ref&gt;Walter B</span>
				<span class='text'>Cannon, ''The Wisdom of the Body</span>
				<span class='text'>' New York: Norton, 1932</span>

				<span class='text'>' New York: Dover, 1957</span>
				<span class='text'>First published in French in 1865</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; His interest in system-theory had been further stimulated through his contract with L</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Henderson</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons called the concept of &quot;system&quot; for an indispensable master concept in the work of building theoretical paradigms for the social sciences</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; From 1952 to 1957 Parsons participated in an ongoing Conference on System Theory under the chairmanship of Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Roy R</span>
				<span class='text'>Grinker, Sr</span>
				<span class='text'>Roy Grinker]] in Chicago</span>
				<span class='text'>During these conferences Parsons came into contact with several prominent intellectuals of the time and he was particularly impressed by the ideas of social insect biologist [[Alfred Emerson]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons was especially compelled by Emerson's idea that in the sociocultural world, the functional equivalent of the gene was that of the &quot;symbol</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Parsons also participated in two of the meetings of the famous [[Macy conferences]] on [[system theory]] (and on issues which today is classified as [[cognitive science]]), which took place in New York in the period from 1946–1953 and include scientists like [[John von Neumann]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons read widely in system theory at the time and read especially some of the works by [[Norbert Wiener]]&lt;ref&gt;Norbert Wiener, ''Cybernetics: Or the Control and Communication in Man and the Machine</span>
				<span class='text'>'Cambridge, Mass: MIT Press, 1948</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; who also were part of the core participants in the Macy Conferences</span>
				<span class='text'>Around the same time Parsons also benefited from conversations with political scientist [[Karl Deutsch]] over the concept of system theory</span>
				<span class='text'>In one conference, the Fourth Conference of the problems of [[consciousness]], taking place in March 1953 at Princeton and sponsored by the Macy Foundation, Parsons would give a presentation on &quot;Conscious and Symbolic Processes&quot; and embark in an intensive group discussion which included exchange with child psychologist [[Jean Piaget]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Among the other participants in the Conference were Mary A</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Brazier, [[Frieda Fromm-Reichmann]], [[Nathaniel Kleitman]], [[Margaret Mead]] and [[Gregory Zilboorg]]</span>
				<span class='text'>During the Conference Parsons would defend the thesis that [[consciousness]] was essentially a social action phenomenon and not primarily a &quot;biological&quot; one</span>
				<span class='text'>During the conference Parsons criticized [[Jean Piaget]] for not sufficiently separating cultural factors from a physiologistic concept of &quot;energy</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;===The McCarthy era, 1952===During the McCarthy era, on April 1, 1952, [[J</span>
				<span class='text'>Edgar Hoover]] received a personal letter from an informant who reported on Communist activities at Harvard</span>
				<span class='text'>During a later interview the informant claimed that &quot;Professor Talcott Parsons </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>was probably the leader of an inner group&quot; of Communist sympathizers at Harvard</span>
				<span class='text'>The informant reported that the old department under Sorokin had been conservative and consisted of &quot;loyal Americans of good character,&quot; but that the new department of Social Relation had turned into a decisive left wing place as a result of &quot;Parsons' manipulations and machinations</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Based on this evidence Hoover granted on October 27, 1952, Boston FBI authorization to initiate a security-type investigation on Parsons</span>
				<span class='text'>In February 1954, Parsons' colleague Samuel Stouffer wrote to Parsons, who was located in England and informed him that he, Stouffer, had been denied access to classified documents and a part of the stated reason was that Stouffer knew Communists, including Talcott Parsons &quot;who was a member of the Communist Party</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Samuel Stouffer to Talcott Parsons, February 5, 1954</span>
				<span class='text'>Talcott Parsons Collection</span>
				<span class='text'>Harvard University Archives</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Parsons immediately wrote an [[affidavit]] in defense of Stouffer, where he also defended himself against the charges</span>
				<span class='text'>In the affidavit Parsons wrote, &quot;This allegation is so preposterous that I cannot understand how any reasonable person could come to the conclusion that I was a member of the Communist Party or ever had been</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Affidavit of February 23, 1954, from Talcott Parsons: Before the Eastern Industrial Personnel Security Board: Matter of Samuel Stouffer</span>

				<span class='text'>Harvard University Archives</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In a personal letter to Stouffer, Parsons wrote, &quot;I will fight for you against this evil with everything there is in me: I am in it with you to the death</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The charges against Parsons resulted in Parsons being unable to participate in a UNESCO conference and it was not until January 1955 that he was acquitted of the charges</span>
				<span class='text'>ince the late 1930s Parsons had continued to show great interest in [[psychology]] and in [[psychoanalysis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In the academic year of 1955-56, he taught a seminar at [[Boston Psychoanalytic Society and Institute]] entitled &quot;Sociology and Psychoanalysis</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; In 1956, he published a major work entitled ''Family, Socialization and Interaction Process''&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons et al</span>
				<span class='text'> ''Family, Socialization and Interaction Process</span>
				<span class='text'>' London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1956</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; which explored the way in which psychology (and psychoanalysis) bounce into the theories of [[motivation]] and [[socialization]], as well into the question of kinship, which for Parsons established the fundamental axis for that subsystem he later would call &quot;the social community</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; This work contained articles written by Parsons alone as well as articles written in collaboration with [[Robert F</span>
				<span class='text'>Bales]], [[James Olds]], [[Morris Zelditch, Jr</span>
				<span class='text'>], and [[Philip E</span>
				<span class='text'>Slater]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The work included a theory of [[Personality psychology|personality]] as well as studies of role-differentiation</span>
				<span class='text'>The strongest intellectual stimuli in this period, Parsons most likely got from brain-researcher [[James Olds]], who was one of the founders of [[neuroscience]] and Olds' book from 1955 on the question of learning and motivation is strongly influenced from his conversations with Parsons</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;James Olds, ''The Growth and Structure of Motives</span>
				<span class='text'>' Glencoe, Illinois: The Free Press, 1955</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Some of the ideas in the book Parsons had submitted in an intellectual brain-storm in an informal &quot;work group,&quot; which he had organized which consisted in part of [[Joseph Berger (sociologist)|Joseph Berger]], William Caudill, Frank E</span>
				<span class='text'>Jones, Kaspar D</span>
				<span class='text'>Naegele, Theodore M</span>
				<span class='text'>Mills and Bengt G</span>

				<span class='text'>In addition professor Albert J</span>
				<span class='text'>Reiss from the Vanderbilt University had submitted his critical commentary</span>
				<span class='text'>During the mid-1950s, Parsons also had extensive discussions with Olds about the motivational structure of psychosomatic problems and Parsons' concept of psychosomatic problems at the time was strongly influence by readings and direct conversations with [[Franz Alexander]] (a psychoanalyst (originally associated with Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute) who was a pioneer of psychosomatic medicine), [[Roy R</span>

				<span class='text'>In his correspondence with Bourricaud, Parsons insisted that he did not necessarily treat values as the only let alone &quot;the primary empirical reference point&quot; of the action system, since so many other factors was involved in the actual historical pattern of an action situation</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Center of Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, 1957-58===Parsons spent the year 1957-58 at the center of Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in [[Palo Alto, California]] where he, for the first time in his life, met [[Kenneth Burke]] whose flamboyant, explosive temperament made a great impression on Parsons</span>
				<span class='text'>The two men became close friends</span>

				<span class='text'>527–537</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Parsons explained in a letter the impression Burke had left on him: &quot;The big thing to me is that Burke more than anyone else has helped me to fill a major gap in my own theoretical interests, in the field of the analysis of expressive symbolism</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;Another scholar Parsons met while at the Center for Advanced Studies in the Behavioral Sciences at Palo Alto was [[Alfred L</span>
				<span class='text'>Kroeber]] who at the time was the &quot;dean of American anthropologists</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Kroeber who had received his Ph</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>at Columbia and who had worked with the Arapaho Indians, was about 81 years old when he met Parsons</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons had the greatest admiration of Kroeber and called him &quot;my favorite elder statesman</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; While in Palo Alto, Kroeber suggested to Parsons that they wrote a joint statement together, which purpose it was to clarify the distinction between cultural and social systems, which in those day was the subject of endless debates</span>
				<span class='text'>In October 1958, Parsons and Kroeber published their joint statement in a small article, which became highly influential</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Alfred L</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Parsons and Kroeber declared in the article that it was important to keep a clear distinction between the two concepts and to avoid a methodology by which the one would be reduced to the other</span>
				<span class='text'>==Discussion of Parsons' writings, late 1950s===During the academic year of 1955-56, a group of faculty members at [[Cornell University]] met regularly and discussed Parsons' writings</span>
				<span class='text'>In the next academic year a series of seven widely attended public seminars followed culminating in a session at which Parsons himself answered his critics</span>
				<span class='text'>The discussions in these seminars was summed up in a joined publication edited by Max Black entitled ''The Social Theories of Talcott Parsons: A Critical Examination'' and included an essay by Parsons called &quot;The point of view of the author</span>

				<span class='text'>The contributions converted many angles including personality theory, organizational theory and various methodological discussions</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons' essay is particularly notable because it, together with another essay published in 1960 and called &quot;Pattern Variables Revisited,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, &quot;Pattern Variables Revisited: A Response to Robert Dubin</span>

				<span class='text'>The essay also included although in meta-theoretical terms a criticism of the theoretical foundations for the so-called &quot;[[conflict theory]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>tarting from the late 1950s and culminating during the student rebellion in the 1960s and its aftermath, Parsons' theory was criticized by some scholars and intellectuals of the left, claiming that  Parsons' theory was:# inherently conservative, if not reactionary</span>
				<span class='text'>Gouldner went so far as claiming that Parsons had been an opponent of the New Deal</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons' theory was further regarded as# unable to reflect social change, human suffering, poverty, deprivation and conflict</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Theda Skocpol]] was of the belief that Apartheid system in South Africa was the ultimate proof that Parsons' theory was &quot;wrong</span>

				<span class='text'>p</span>
				<span class='text'>ii</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; At the same time,# Parsons' idea of the individual was seen as &quot;oversocialized,&quot; &quot;repressive,&quot; or subjugated in normative &quot;conformity&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'> In addition, [[Jürgen Habermas]]&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Habermas, &quot;Talcott Parsons: Problems of Theory Construction</span>

				<span class='text'>1981</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and countless others were of the belief that Parsons' system-theory and his action-theory was inherently opposed, indeed, hostile to each other and that Parsons' system theory was especially &quot;mechanical,&quot; &quot;positivistic,&quot; &quot;anti-individualistic,&quot; &quot;anti-voluntaristic&quot; &quot;de-humanizing&quot; by the sheer nature of its intrinsic theoretical context</span>
				<span class='text'>By the same token,# Parsons' evolutionary theory was regarded as &quot;uni-linear,&quot; &quot;mechanical,&quot; &quot;biologistic,&quot; and nothing but an ode to world-system status-qua or simply an ill-concealed instruction manual for &quot;the capitalist nation-state</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He discussed the Kennedy election widely in his correspondence at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons was especially interested in the symbolic implications involved in the fact of Kennedy's [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] background for the implications for United States as an integral community</span>
				<span class='text'>(It was the first and so far only time a Catholic became President of the United States</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Parsons who described himself as a &quot;Stevenson Democrat,&quot; was especially enthusiastic about that his favored politician [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] had been appointed [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons had persistently voted for Stevenson in both of the years he had run for election and was greatly disappointed that Stevenson twice was rejected by the American voters</span>
				<span class='text'>n the early 1960s it became obvious that Parsons' ideas had a great impact on much of the theories of [[modernization]] at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>His influence was very extensive yet at the same time the concrete adoption of his theory was often quite selective, half-hearted, superficial and at times utterly confused</span>
				<span class='text'>In this way, many of the modernization theorists never used the full power of Parsons theory but concentrated on some formalist formula, which often was taken out of context with the deeper meaning by which Parsons originally had introduced them</span>
				<span class='text'>Nonetheless, works such as [[Gabriel A</span>
				<span class='text'>Almond]] and [[James Smoot Coleman|James S</span>

				<span class='text'>Pye]], [[Sidney Verba]] and [[Chalmers Johnson]] among others were importantly influenced by Talcott Parsons in some way or another</span>
				<span class='text'>Indeed, it was the intensive influence of Parsons ideas in [[Political sociology]], which originally made a scholar like William Buxton interested in Parsons work</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a scholar like [[David Easton]] would claim that in the history of [[Political Science]], the two scholars who had made any serious attempt to construct a general theory for Political Science on the issue of political support were himself and Talcott Parsons</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The correspondence would continue when Bellah in the early fall of 1960 went to Japan in order to study Japanese religion and ideology</span>

				<span class='text'>is a first rate and fit beautifully with the broad position I have taken</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; [[Perry Miller]] (1905–1963) was a literary Harvard historian whose books such as ''The New England Mind''&lt;ref&gt;Perry Miller, ''The New England Mind: The Seventeenth Century</span>
				<span class='text'>' Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1983</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; established new standards for the writing of American cultural and religious history</span>
				<span class='text'>Miller remain one of Parsons most favoured historians throughout his life</span>
				<span class='text'>Indeed, [[religion]] had always a special place in Parsons heart, although his son in an interview maintained that he didn't really think that his father was &quot;religious</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Throughout his life Parsons interacted with a broad range of intellectuals and others who took a deep interest in religious belief systems, doctrines and institutions</span>
				<span class='text'>One notable person among these people whom Parsons interacted with in this regard was Maria Augusta Neal who was a Catholic sister of [[Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur|Notre Dame de Namur]], who would send Parsons countless of her manuscripts and invite him to Conferences and intellectual events in the [[Catholic Church]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Maria Augusta Neal received her Ph</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>from Harvard under Parsons supervision in 1963 and would eventually became professor (then Chair) of sociology at [[Emmanuel College (Massachusetts)|Emmanuel College]] in Boston</span>
				<span class='text'>Maria Augusta Neal was very enthusiastic about the [[Second Vatican Council]] and became known for the [[National Sisters Survey]], which aimed at improving women's position in the Catholic Church</span>

				<span class='text'>Also reprinted in Talcott Parsons, ''Social Structure and Personality</span>
				<span class='text'>' New York: [[Free Press (publisher)|The Free Press]], 1964</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Parsons and White's article was a critical discussion of [[David Riesman]]'s ''[[The Lonely Crowd]],''&lt;ref&gt;David Riesman, [[Nathan Glazer]] and [[Reuel Denney]], ''The Lonely Crowd</span>
				<span class='text'>' New Haven: [[Yale University Press]], 1950</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; which had been published a decade earlier and which had turned into an unexpected bestseller reaching 1 million sold copies in 1977</span>
				<span class='text'>Riesman was a prominent member of the American academic left influenced by [[Erich Fromm]] and the [[Frankfurt School]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In reality, Riesman's book was an academic attempt to give credit to the concept of &quot;[[mass society]]&quot; and especially to the idea of an America suffocated in social conformity</span>
				<span class='text'>Riesman had essentially argued that at the emerging of highly advanced [[capitalism]], the America basic value-system and its socializing roles had change from an &quot;inner-directed&quot; toward an &quot;other-directed&quot; pattern of value-orientation</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons and White challenged Riesman's idea and argued that there had been no change away from an inner-directed personality structure</span>
				<span class='text'>While noticing that Riesman's &quot;other-directness&quot; look like a caricature of [[Charles Cooley|Cooley]]'s [[looking-glass self]],&lt;ref&gt;Charles H</span>

				<span class='text'>183–184</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; they argued that the framework of &quot;[[New institutional economics|institutional individualism]]&quot; as the basic code-structure of America's normative system had essentially not changed</span>
				<span class='text'>What had happen, however, was that the industrialized process and its increased pattern of societal differentiation had changed the family's generalized symbolic function in society and had allowed for a greater permissiveness in the way the child related to his parents</span>
				<span class='text'>This, however, Parsons and White argued, was not the prelude to greater &quot;otherdirectness&quot; but a more complicated way by which inner-directed pattern situated itself in the social environment</span>
				<span class='text'>==Political power and the concept of Influence, 1963===1963 became a notable year in Parsons's theoretical development because it was the year when he published two important articles; one on [[political power]]&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, &quot;On the Concept of Political Power</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' 107 (1963)</span>
				<span class='text'>Reprinted in Talcott Parsons, ''Politics and Social Structure</span>
				<span class='text'>' New York: Free Press, 1969</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and one on the concept of [[Social influence|influence]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, &quot;On the Concept of Influence</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; ''Public Opinion Quarterly'' Spring 1963</span>
				<span class='text'>Reprinted in Talcott Parsons, ''Sociological Theory and Modern Society</span>
				<span class='text'>' New York: The Free Press, 1967</span>
				<span class='text'>Also published in Talcott Parsons, ''Politics and Social Structure</span>
				<span class='text'>' New York: The Free Press, 1969</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The two articles represented Parsons's first published attempt to work out the idea of Generalized Symbolic Media as an integral part of the exchange processes within the AGIL system</span>
				<span class='text'>This was a theoretical development, which Parsons had worked on ever since the publication of ''Economy and Society'' (1956)</span>
				<span class='text'>The prime model for the generalized symbolic media was [[money]] and Parsons was reflecting on the question whether the functional characteristics of money represented an exclusive uniqueness of the economic system or whether it was possible to identify other generalized symbolic media in other subsystems as well</span>
				<span class='text'>Although each medium had unique characteristics, Parsons claimed that power (for the [[political system]]) and [[Social influence|influence]] (for the societal community) had institutional functions, which essentially was structurally similar to the general systemic function of money</span>
				<span class='text'>Utilizing [[Roman Jakobson]]'s idea of &quot;code&quot; and &quot;message,&quot; Parsons divided the components of the media into a question of value-principle versus coordination standards for the &quot;code-structure&quot; and the question of factor versus product control within those social process which carried the &quot;message&quot; components</span>
				<span class='text'>In this way, while &quot;utility&quot; could be regarded as the value-principle for the [[economy]] (medium: money), &quot;effectiveness&quot; was the value-principle for the [[political system]] (medium: [[political power]]) and [[social solidarity|solidarity]] for the societal community (medium: [[Social influence|influence]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons would eventually chose the concept of value-commitment as the generalized symbolic medium for the fiduciary system with [[integrity]] as the value-principle</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Also, among the scholars on whom Parsons and Nelson would share internal commentaries was the work of [[Jürgen Habermas]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ark Gould was educated at [[Reed College]] in [[Portland, Oregon]], at the time a center for political radicalism</span>
				<span class='text'>At Reed, Gould's theoretical interest was sparked by Professor Howard Jolly's exegesis of Parsons</span>
				<span class='text'>Gould decided that he wanted to study with Parsons and arrived at Harvard in the fall of 1967 and entered Parsons' office, at their first meeting, with hair down to his shoulders, with a wild beard and dressed in the colorful manners of the late sixties</span>
				<span class='text'>Gould would become Parsons' research assistant by the summer of 1968</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons was opposed to the [[Vietnam War]], yet he was disturbed by what he considered the anti-intellectual tendency in the student rebellion, where serious debate often was substituted by handy slogans by [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Mao Zedong|Mao]] and [[Fidel Castro]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Gould, who was thrown out by the state police from University Hall (at Harvard) early in the morning on April 10, 1969, often had heated discussions with Parsons about politics and society in Parsons' office, yet as Gould insisted these dialogues were always theoretically fruitful</span>
				<span class='text'>==1960s: Toward a concept of the societal community: Ethnicity, kinship and diffuse solidarity===Talcott Parsons had for years corresponded with his former graduate student [[David M</span>
				<span class='text'>Schneider]] who had taught at the [[University of California Berkeley]] before he in 1960 accepted a position as professor in Anthropology at the [[University of Chicago]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Schneider had received his Ph</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>at Harvard in Social Anthropology in 1949 and had become a leading expert in the American kinship system</span>
				<span class='text'>Schneider had in 1968 published ''American Kinship: A cultural account,''&lt;ref&gt;David M</span>
				<span class='text'>Schneider, ''American Kinship: A Cultural Account'' Englewood Cliffs, N</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> Prentice-Hall, 1968</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; which became a classic within the field and he had sent Parsons a copy of the copy-edited manuscript before publication</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons was highly appreciative of Schneider's work and Schneider became in many ways a crucial bouncing-point for Parsons' own attempt to understand the fundamental elements of the American kinship system, which for him was a key to understand the factor of [[ethnicity]] and especially to build up the theoretical foundation of his concept of the societal community, which by the beginning of the early 1970s had begun to become a strong priority in the number of theoretical projects, which occupied his intellectual life</span>
				<span class='text'>Among other things Parsons borrowed the term &quot;diffuse enduring solidarity&quot; from Schneider as a major concept for his own considerations regarding the theoretical construction of the concept of the societal community</span>
				<span class='text'>In the spring of 1968 Parsons and Schneider discussed [[Clifford Geertz]]'s article on religion as a cultural system&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Geertz, &quot;Religion as a cultural system&quot; in Clifford Geertz, ''The Interpretation of Cultures</span>
				<span class='text'>' New York: Basic Books, 1973</span>
				<span class='text'>pp</span>
				<span class='text'>87–125</span>
				<span class='text'>Originally published in 1966</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; in regard to which Parsons wrote a review article</span>

				<span class='text'> ''The Religious Situation, 1968</span>
				<span class='text'>' Boston: Beason,1968</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Parsons, who was a close friend of Geertz, was puzzled over Geertz's article</span>
				<span class='text'>In a letter to David Schneider, Parsons spoke about &quot;the rather sharp strictures on what he (Geertz) calls the extremely narrow intellectual tradition with special reference to Weber, but also to Durkheim</span>
				<span class='text'>My basic point is in this respect, he greatly overstated his case seeming to argue that this intellectual tradition was by now irrelevant</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; David Schneider wrote back to Parsons, &quot;So much, so often, as I read Cliff's stuff I cannot get a clear consistent picture of just what the religious system consist in instead only how it is said to work</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In a letter of July 1968 to Gene Tanke of the University of California Press, Parsons offers a critical note on the state of psychoanalytical theory and writes: &quot;The use of psychoanalytical theory in interpretation of social and historical subject matter is somewhat hazardous enterprise, and a good deal of nonsense has been written in the name of such attempts</span>

				<span class='text'>Talcott Parsons Collection</span>
				<span class='text'>Harvard University Archives</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Around 1969, Parsons was approached by the prestigious ''Encyclopedia of the History of Idea'' about writing an entrance in the encyclopedia on the topic of the &quot;Sociology of Knowledge</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Parsons accepted and wrote one of his most powerful essays entitled &quot;The Sociology of Knowledge and the History of Ideas&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, &quot;The Sociology of Knowledge and the History of Ideas</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; In Helmut Staubmann (ed</span>
				<span class='text'>''Action Theory: Methodological Studies</span>
				<span class='text'>' LIT Verlag, Wien, 2006</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; during the period of 1969–1970</span>
				<span class='text'>In this essay Parsons discussed how the [[Sociology of knowledge]] as a modern intellectual discipline had emerged from the dynamics of [[European intellectual history]] reaching a kind of cutting point in the philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]] and further explored by [[Hegel]] yet reaching its first &quot;classical&quot; formulation in the writing of [[Karl Mannheim]],&lt;ref&gt;Karl Mannheim, ''Ideology and Utopia</span>
				<span class='text'>' New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1936 [1929]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; whose brilliance Parsons acknowledged yet also found himself in opposition to, since Mannheim never betrayed [[German historicism]], whose antipositivistic epistemology was largely rejected in the more positivistic world of American social science</span>
				<span class='text'>For various reasons the editors of the encyclopedia turned down Parsons essay since it didn't fit the general format of their volume, so Parsons essay was not published before 2006</span>

				<span class='text'>' LIT verlag, Wien 2006</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Parsons had several conversations with [[Daniel Bell]] on a &quot;[[Post-industrial society]]&quot;, some of which were conducted over lunch at William James Hall</span>
				<span class='text'>After reading an early version of Bell's [[masterpiece|magnum opus]], &quot;The Coming of the Post-Industrial Society&quot;, Parsons wrote a letter to Daniel Bell dated November 30, 1971, where he offered his criticism</span>
				<span class='text'>Among his many critical points, Parsons stressed especially that Bell's discussion of technology tended to &quot;separate off culture&quot; and treat these two categories &quot;as what I would call culture minus the cognitive component</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;Parsons's interest in the role of ethnicity and religion in the genesis of social solidarity within the local community heavily influenced another of his early 1960s graduate students, [[Edward Laumann]]</span>
				<span class='text'>As a student, Laumann was interested in the role of social network structure in shaping community-level solidarity</span>
				<span class='text'>Combining Parsons's interest in the role of ethnicity in shaping local community solidarity with [[W</span>
				<span class='text'>Lloyd Warner]]'s structural approach to social class, Laumann argued that ethnicity, religion, and perceived social class together play a large role in structuring community social networks</span>

				<span class='text'>quot; ''American Journal of Sociology'' 81:1304–1338</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Laumann's work found that community networks are highly partitioned along lines of ethnicity, religion, and occupational social status</span>
				<span class='text'>It also highlighted the tension individuals experience between their preference to associate with people who are like them ([[homophily]]) and the simultaneous desire to affiliate with higher-status others</span>
				<span class='text'>Later, at the beginning of his career at the [[University of Chicago]], Laumann would argue that how these impulses are resolved by individuals forms the basis of corporate or competitive [[class consciousness]] within a given community</span>

				<span class='text'>quot; ''Connections'' 27:65-90</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In addition to demonstrating how community solidarity can be conceptualized as a [[social network]], and the role of ethnicity, religion, and class in shaping such networks, Laumann's dissertation became one of the first examples of the use of population-based surveys in the collection of [[social network analysis|social network]] data, and thus a precursor to decades of egocentric social network analysis</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Linton C</span>
				<span class='text'>''The Development of Social Network Analysis</span>
				<span class='text'>' Vancouver: Empirical Press, 2004</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Parsons thus played an important role in shaping social network analysis's early interest in homophily, and the use of egocentric network data to assess group- and community-level social network structures</span>
				<span class='text'>==Early 1970s: System-theoretical considerations about biological and social systems===In his later years Parsons became increasingly interested in working out the higher conceptual parameters of the human condition, which in part led him toward rethinking questions of cultural and social evolution and the &quot;nature&quot; of telic systems, the latter which he especially discussed with [[Robert Bellah]], Victor Lidz, Reene Fox, Willy de Craemer and others</span>
				<span class='text'>As a part of this pattern, Parsons became increasingly interested in clarifying the relationship between biological and social theory</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons was the initiator of the first Daedalus conference on &quot;Some Relations between biological and social theory&quot; sponsored by the American Academy of Arts and Science</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons wrote a memorandum dated September 16, 1971, where he spelled out the intellectual framework for the conference</span>
				<span class='text'>As Parsons explained in the memo, the basic goal of the conference was to establish a conceptual fundament for a theory of [[living systems]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The first conference was held on January 7, 1972</span>
				<span class='text'>Among the participants beside Parsons and Victor Lidz were [[Ernst Mayr]], [[Seymour Kety]], [[Gerald Holton]], [[A</span>
				<span class='text'>Hunter Dupree]], and [[William Kurtz Wimsatt, Jr</span>
				<span class='text'>William Wimsatt]]</span>
				<span class='text'>A second Daedalus Conference on Living Systems was held on March 1–2, 1974, and included [[Edward O</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilson]], who at the time was about to publish his famous work on [[sociobiology]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Other new participants were John T</span>
				<span class='text'>Bonner, [[Karl H</span>
				<span class='text'>Pribram]], Eric Lennenberg and [[Stephen J</span>
				<span class='text'>Gould]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==Early 1970s===Parsons began in the fall of 1972 to conduct a seminar on &quot;Law and Sociology&quot; with [[Lon L</span>
				<span class='text'>Fuller]] who was well known for his work ''The Morality of Law'' (1964)</span>
				<span class='text'>The seminar and his conversations with Fuller stimulated Parsons to write one of this most influential articles &quot;Law as an Intellectual Stepchild</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, &quot;Law as an Intellectual Stepchild&quot; ''Sociological Inquiry'' Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>7</span>
				<span class='text'>Nos 3-4, 1977</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In this article Parsons discusses among other things [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]]'s ''Law in Modern Society'' (1976)</span>
				<span class='text'>Another indication of Parsons interest in law is reflected in his students, hence Parsons' student [[John Akula]] writes his dissertation in Sociology on the topic ''Law and the Development of Citizenship'' (1973)</span>
				<span class='text'>In September 1972 Parsons participates in a Conference in Salzburg on &quot;The Social Consequences of Modernization in Socialist Countries</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Among the other participants in this conference is [[Alex Inkeles]], Ezra Vogel, and [[Ralf Dahrendorf]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1972 Parsons wrote two review articles, where he discussed the work of [[Reinhard Bendix]], which provides a clear statement on Parsons' approach to the study of [[Max Weber]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Bendix was an emigrant scholar who had become well known for his Weber-interpretations</span>
				<span class='text'>In the first review article, Parsons analyzed Bendix's work entitled ''Embattled Reason</span>
				<span class='text'>'&lt;ref&gt;Reinhard Bendix, ''Embattled Reason: Essays on Social Knowledge</span>
				<span class='text'>' New York: Oxford University Press, 1970</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Parsons basically praised the work's attempt to defend the basic values of [[cognitive rationality]], a defense Parsons unconditionally shared and he agree with Bendix that the question of cognitive rationality was primarily a cultural issue and not a category, which could be reduced from biologial, economic and social factors</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Parsons did have problems with the way Bendix had proceed with his task and he especially felt that Bendix had misrepresented the work of [[Freud]] and [[Durkheim]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons found that the real reason behind this case of misrepresentation lied in the way Bendix tended to conceive the question of systematic theorizing under the concept of &quot;reductionism</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, ''Review essay: Embattled Reason: Essays on Social Knowledge, by Reinhard Bendix</span>

				<span class='text'>pp</span>
				<span class='text'>66-768</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Parsons further found that Bendix approach suffered from a &quot;conspicuous hostility&quot; toward the idea of [[evolution]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It was true Parsons assessed that [[Max Weber]] rejected the one-linear evolutionary approaches of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Herbert Spencer]] but it didn't follow that Weber rejected the question of evolution as a generalized question</span>
				<span class='text'>In his second review article, which was a commentary of [[Reinhard Bendix]] and [[Guenther Roth]], ''Scholarship and Partisanship: Essays on Max Weber,''&lt;ref&gt;Reinhard Bendix and Guenther Roth, ''Scholarship and Partisanship: Essays on Max Weber</span>
				<span class='text'>' University of California Press, 1970</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Parsons continued his line of criticism</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons was especially concerned with a statement by Bendix, where Bendix claimed that Weber was a subscriber to [[Karl Marx]]'s notion that ideas were &quot;the epiphenomena of the organization of production</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Parsons strongly rejected this assessment</span>
				<span class='text'>As he said: &quot;I should contend that certainly the intellectual &quot;mature&quot; Weber never was an &quot;hypothetical&quot; Marxist</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, &quot;Review of Scholarship and Partisanship: Essays on Max Weber, by Reinhard Bendix and Guenther Roth</span>

				<span class='text'>200–203</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Somewhere behind these attitudes of Bendix, Parsons detected a discomport on Bendix behalf to move out of an &quot;idiographic&quot; mode of theorizing</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1973 Parsons published ''The American University,'' which he had coauthored together with Gerald M</span>
				<span class='text'>Platt</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons and Gerald M</span>
				<span class='text'>Platt, ''The American University</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The idea had originally emerged then Martin Meyerson and Stephen Graubard of the American Academy of the Art and Sciences in 1969 asked Parsons to undertake a monographic study of the American University System</span>
				<span class='text'>The work on the book went on for years and was first finished in June 1972</span>
				<span class='text'>From the theoretical point of view the book had several functions, one important one was to substantiate Parsons' concept of the educational revolution, which was a crucial component in his theory of the rise of the modern world</span>
				<span class='text'>What was equally intellectually compelling, however, was undoubtedly Parsons' discussion of &quot;the cognitive complex&quot;, which aimed at explaining how cognitive rationality and learning operated as an interpenetrative zone on the level of the general action-system in society</span>
				<span class='text'>In retrospect the categories of &quot;the cognitive complex&quot; serve as a theoretical foundation for an understanding of what has been called the modern knowledge-based society</span>
				<span class='text'>==Retired from Harvard, 1973===He retired from Harvard in 1973, but continued his writing, teaching and other activities in the same rapid pace as before</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons also continued his extensive correspondence with a wide group of colleagues and intellectuals</span>
				<span class='text'>He taught at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[Brown University]], [[Rutgers University]], the [[University of Chicago]] and the [[University of California at Berkeley]]</span>
				<span class='text'>At Parsons' retirement banquet held on May 18, 1973, Robert K</span>
				<span class='text'>Merton was asked to preside, while John Riley, Bernard Barber, Jesse Pitts, Neil J</span>
				<span class='text'>Smelser and John Akula were asked to share their experiences of the man with the audience</span>
				<span class='text'>ne scholar who became important in Parsons' later years was professor [[Martin U</span>
				<span class='text'>Martel]] of [[Brown University]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Martel and Parsons made contact in the early 1970s, the occasion was a discussion of an article, which Martel had written about Talcott Parsons' work</span>

				<span class='text'>Shields</span>
				<span class='text'>In February–May 1974, Parsons also gave the Culver lectures at Brown and spoke on the issue &quot;The Evolution of Society</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; These lectures as well as the seminars were videotaped</span>
				<span class='text'>ate in life Parsons began to work out a new level of the AGIL model, which he called &quot;A Paradigm of the Human Condition</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, &quot;A Paradigm of the Human Condition&quot; in Talcott Parsons, ''Action Theory and the Human Condition</span>
				<span class='text'>' New York: Free Press, 1978</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This new level of the AGIL model crystallized in the summer of 1974 and the ideas of the new paradigm he worked out with a variety of people but especially with Victor Lidz, Renee Fox and Harold Bershady</span>
				<span class='text'>The new meta-paradigm featured the environment of the general action system, which include the physical system, the biological system and what Parsons called the telic system; the latter system represented the sphere of ultimate values in a sheer metaphysical sense</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons also worked toward a more comprehensive understanding of the code-structure of social systems&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, &quot;Action, Symbols and Cybernetic Control</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; in Ino Rossi (ed</span>
				<span class='text'> ''Structural Sociology</span>
				<span class='text'>' New York: [[Columbia University Press]], 1982</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and on the logic of the cybernetic pattern of control facilitating the AGIL model, where he among many things worked out a bulk of notes, he called &quot;Thoughts on the linking of systems&quot; and another memo he called &quot;money and time</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Parsons had during his lifetime worked intensively with questions of [[medical sociology]], the medical profession, [[psychiatry]], psychosomatic problems and related issues with the questions of [[health]] and [[illness]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Most of all Parsons had become known for his concept of &quot;the [[Sick role]]</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; This field of social research was an issue, which Parsons constantly developed through elaboration and self-criticism</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons participated at the World Congress of Sociology in Toronto in August 1974, where he presented a paper called &quot;The sick role revisited: a response to critics and an updating in terms of the theory of action,&quot; which was published under a slightly different title in 1975</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In his essay Parsons highlighted that his concept of &quot;sick role&quot; never was meant to confine this category to &quot;deviant behavior,&quot; although as he stated it: &quot;its negative valuation should not be forgotten</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; It was also important to keep a certain focus on the &quot;motivatedness&quot; of illness, since there always is a factor of unconscious motivation in the therapeutic aspects of the sick role</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The Covenant&quot; Bellah refers to the sermon delivered by [[John Winthrop]] (1587–1649) to this flock on board his ship 'Arbella' on the evening of the landing in [[Massachusetts Bay]] in the year 1630</span>
				<span class='text'>In his sermon Winthrop declared that the Puritan colonists emigrating to the New World was part of a special pact (Covenant) with God to create a holy community</span>
				<span class='text'>Winthrop used the phrases: &quot;For we must consider that we shall be a city on the hill</span>
				<span class='text'>The eyes of all people are upon us</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Parsons disagreed strongly with Bellah's analysis in ''The Broken Covenant'' and insisted that &quot;the covenant&quot; was not broken</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons later used a major part of his influential article, &quot;Law as an Intellectual Stepchild&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, &quot;Law as an intellectual stepchild&quot; in Harry M</span>
				<span class='text'>Johnson (ed</span>
				<span class='text'> ''System and Legal Process'' San Francisco, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; to discuss Bellah's position in ''The Broken Covenant</span>
				<span class='text'>' Parsons found that Bellah unduly trivialized the discussion of the tension and problems involved in questions of individual interests and collective interests on the level of total society by reducing them to the concept of &quot;capitalism</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Parsons find that Bellah in his characterization of the negative aspects of American society is compelled by a charismatic-based optimalism and he declared that Bellah's position in ''The Broken Covenant'' is that of [[moral absolutism]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Parsons regarded symbolic interactionism and the theory of [[George Herbert Mead]] as valuable contributions to action theory specifying certain aspects of the theory of the personality of the individual</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons, however, criticized the symbolic interactionism of [[Herbert Blumer]], since in Blumer's theory there is no end to the openness of action</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons regarded Blumer as the mirror image of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]&lt;ref&gt;Claude Lévi-Strauss, ''Structural Anthropology</span>
				<span class='text'>' Garden City, New York, 1963</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; who tended to stress the quasi-determined nature of macro-structural systems</span>
				<span class='text'>Action theory, Parsons maintained, represented a middle ground between these two extremes</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1976 Parsons was asked to contribute to a volume celebrating the eightieth years birthday of [[Jean Piaget]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons contributed with an essay called &quot;A few considerations on the place of rationality in Modern Culture and Society</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Parsons characterized Piaget as the most eminent contributor to cognitive theory in the 20th century</span>
				<span class='text'>However, in his article, he also argued that the future study of [[cognition]] had to go beyond its narrow encounter with [[psychology]] and aim at a higher understanding of how cognition as a human intellectual force was entangled in the processes of social and cultural institutionalization</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; he generally praised the herculean task behind Miller's work but he criticized Miller for getting caught in the effort of hierarchize concrete systems while underplaying the importance of structural categories in [[theory building]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons was also concerned about Miller's lack of any clear-cut discrimination between cultural and non-cultural systems</span>

				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=August 2010}}==Work=={{Sociology}}Parsons produced a general theoretical system for the analysis of [[society]], which he called 'theory of action' based on the methodological and epistemological principle of &quot;analytical realism&quot; and on the ontological assumption of &quot;voluntaristic action</span>

				<span class='text'>' New York: McGraw-Hill, 1937</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Parsons concept of analytical realism can be regarded as a kind of compromise between [[nominalist]] and [[philosophical realism|realist]] views on the nature of reality and human knowledge</span>

				<span class='text'>27</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Parsons assesses that we (as scientists and humans) relate to objective reality but only through a particular encounter of such reality, and that our general intellectual understanding is only feasible through conceptual schemes and theories</span>
				<span class='text'>Our interaction with objective reality on an intellectual level should always be understood as an approach</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons often explicated the meaning of analytical realism by quoting a statement by L</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Henderson: &quot;A fact is a statement about experience in terms of a conceptual scheme</span>

				<span class='text'>p</span>
				<span class='text'>27</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Generally, Parsons maintained that his inspiration regarding analytical realism had been [[Lawrence Joseph Henderson]] and [[A</span>

				<span class='text'>Chapter 5</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; although it is possible the idea originated much earlier</span>
				<span class='text'>It is important in this regard that Parsons' &quot;analytical realism&quot; insist on the reference to an objective reality since Parsons at several occasions highlighted that his concept of &quot;analytical realism&quot; was importantly different from the &quot;fictionalism&quot; of Hans Vaihiger (Hans Vaihinger)</span>

				<span class='text'>New York: Barnes &amp; Noble, 1952</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; As Parsons specifies this: &quot;We must start with the assertion that all knowledge which purports to be valid in anything like the scientific sense presumes both the reality of object known and of a knower</span>
				<span class='text'>I think we can go beyond that and say that there must be a community of knowers who are able to communicate with each other</span>
				<span class='text'>Without such a presupposition it would seem difficult to avoid the pitfall of solipsism</span>
				<span class='text'>The so-called natural sciences do not, however, impute the &quot;status of knowing subjects&quot; to the objects with which they deal</span>

				<span class='text'>52</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===The Structure of Social Action===''[[The Structure of Social Action]]'' (SSA), Parsons' most famous work, took form piece by piece</span>
				<span class='text'>Its central figure was Weber, and the other key figures in the discussion were added little by little as the central idea took form</span>
				<span class='text'>One important work that helped Parsons' central argument in SSA was when in 1932 he unexpectedly found [[Élie Halévy]], ''La Formation du Radicalisme Philosophique'', (1901–1904) a three-volume work, which he read in French</span>
				<span class='text'>About Halévy work, Parsons explained, &quot;Well, Halévy was just a different world </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>and helped me to really get in to many clarifications of the assumptions distinctive to the main line of [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian thought]]; assumptions about the 'natural identity of interest', and so on</span>
				<span class='text'>I still think it is one of the true masterpieces in intellectual history</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin U</span>
				<span class='text'>Martel 1975&quot;/&gt; Parsons first achieved significant recognition with the publication of ''The Structure of Social Action'' (1937), his first grand synthesis, combining the ideas of Durkheim, [[Max Weber]], and [[Vilfredo Pareto|Pareto]], among others</span>
				<span class='text'>==Parsons' action theory===Parsons' action theory can be characterized as an attempt to maintain the scientific rigour of positivism, while acknowledging the necessity of the &quot;subjective dimension&quot; of human action incorporated in hermeneutic types of sociological theories</span>
				<span class='text'>It is cardinal in Parsons' general theoretical and methodological view that human action must be understood in conjunction with the motivational component of the human act</span>
				<span class='text'>In this way social science must consider the question of ends, purpose and ideals in its analysis of human action</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons' strong reaction to behavioristic theory as well as to sheer materialistic approaches derives from the attempt of these theoretical positions to eliminate ends, purpose and ideals as factors of analysis</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons already in his college student term-papers at Amherst criticized attempts to reduce human life to psychological, biological or materialist forces</span>
				<span class='text'>What was essential in human life, Parsons maintained, was how the factor of [[culture]] was codified</span>
				<span class='text'>Culture, however, was to Parsons an independent variable in that it could not be &quot;deducted&quot; from any other factor of the social system</span>
				<span class='text'>This methodological intention is given the most elaborate presentation in ''The Structure of Social Action,'' which was Parsons' first basic discussion of the methodological foundation of the social sciences</span>
				<span class='text'>Some of the themes reaching a high point in ''The Structure of Social Action'' were presented in a compelling essay published two years earlier with the title: &quot;The Place of Ultimate Values in Sociological Theory</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, &quot;The Place of Ultimate Values in Sociological Theory</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; In Talcott Parsons, ''The Early Essays</span>
				<span class='text'>' Edited by Charles Camic</span>
				<span class='text'>Chicago &amp; London: The University of Chicago, 1991</span>
				<span class='text'>(The essay is originally published in 1935)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Relations to cybernetics and system theory===Parsons developed his ideas during a period when [[systems theory]] and [[cybernetics]] were very much on the front burner of social and behavioral science</span>
				<span class='text'>In using systems thinking, he postulated that the relevant systems treated in social and behavioral science were &quot;open,&quot; meaning that they were embedded in an environment consisting of other systems</span>
				<span class='text'>For social and behavioral science, the largest system is &quot;the action system,&quot; consisting of interrelated behaviors of human beings, embedded in a physical-organic environment</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;A good summary of the &quot;action frame of reference&quot; as it developed over time is found in Leonard Mayhew's introduction to his anthology of Parsons' major essays: Mayhew, Leonard (1982) &quot;Introduction&quot; in Talcott Parsons, ''Talcott Parsons on institutions and social evolution'', pp: 1–62</span>
				<span class='text'>Chicago: University of Chicago Press</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;As Parsons developed his theory it became increasingly bound to the fields of cybernetics and system theory, but also to [[Alfred E</span>

				<span class='text'>Brill, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; On the meta-theoretical level Parson attempted to balance psychologist phenomenology and idealism on the one hand and pure types of what Parsons called the utilitarian-positivistic complex, on the other hand</span>
				<span class='text'>The theory includes a general theory of [[social evolution]] and a concrete interpretation of the major drives of world-history</span>
				<span class='text'>In Parsons' theory of history and evolution, the constitutive-cognitive symbolization of the cybernetic hierarchy of action-systemic levels has in principle the same function as genetic information in DNA's control of biological evolution, except this factor of meta-systemic control does not &quot;determine&quot; any outcome, but rather defines the orientational boundaries of the real pathfinder, which is action itself</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons compares also the constitutive level of society with Noam Chomsky's concept of &quot;deep structure</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; As Parsons writes, &quot;The deep structures do not as such articulate any sentences which could convey coherent meaning</span>
				<span class='text'>The surface structures constitute the level at which this occurs</span>
				<span class='text'>The connecting link between them is a set of rules of transformation, to use Chomsky's own phase</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===A unified concept of social science===Parsons' theory reflects a vision of a unified concept of [[social science]] and indeed, of [[living systems]]&lt;ref&gt;Parsons discusses the concept of living systems many places in the last phase of his life both in publications as well in his correspondence with Hunter A</span>
				<span class='text'>Dupree, Victor Lidz, Martin U</span>
				<span class='text'>Martel and others</span>
				<span class='text'>One important discussion of Living System is in the following: Talcott Parsons, &quot;Concrete Systems and &quot;Abstracted&quot; Systems: Review article of Living Systems by James Grier Miller</span>

				<span class='text'>696–705</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; in general</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons' approach differs in essence from Niklas Luhmann's theory because Parsons rejects the idea that systems can be autopoietic short of the actual action-system of individual actors</span>
				<span class='text'>Systems have immanent capacities but only as an outcome of the institutionalized processes of action-systems, which in the final analysis consists of the historical effort of individual actors</span>
				<span class='text'>While [[Niklas Luhmann]] became caught up in sheer systemic immanence, Parsons insisted that the question of autocatalytic and homeostatic processes on the one hand, and the question about the actor as the ultimate &quot;first mover&quot; on the other, was not mutually exclusive</span>
				<span class='text'>Homeostatic processes might be ''necessary'' if and when they occur but action is ''necessitating</span>
				<span class='text'>'It is only within this perspective of the ultimate reference in action that Parsons' dictum that higher order cybernetic systems during the course of history will tend to control social forms organized on the lower levels of the cybernetic hierarchy, should be understood</span>
				<span class='text'>For Parsons the highest levels of the cybernetic hierarchy as far as the general action level is concerned is what Parsons calls the constitutive part of the Cultural system (the L of the L)</span>
				<span class='text'>However, within the interactional processes of the system specially attention should be made to the cultural-expressivistic axis (the L-G line in the AGIL)</span>
				<span class='text'>By the term &quot;constitutive,&quot; Parsons generally referred to very highly codified cultural values especially religious elements (but other interpretation of the term &quot;constitutive&quot; is possible)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;The complete structure of Parsons AGIL system was scattered around in dozen of his works and not presented in any handy form anywhere</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the most elementary key elements was presented in chapter 2 in Talcott Parsons and Gerald M</span>
				<span class='text'>Platt, ''The American University'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1973</span>
				<span class='text'>In order to understand the AGIL system one needs to understand that it functions (in a sense) on three major levels: The highest level is the paradigm of the human condition, the next mediative level is what he calls the general action-system and the third level is the social system</span>
				<span class='text'>(All three levels are active in any empirical social object at any time)</span>
				<span class='text'>Another important point is that Parsons in a sense operates with two cultural systems; since there is the cultural system of the general action level and there is the so-called fiduciary system as the L-function of the social system</span>
				<span class='text'>Common sense associates both systems with the idea of &quot;culture</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; However, Parsons' separation of &quot;culture&quot; into these two distinct levels of conceptual analysis is fundamental</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Cultural systems Parsons maintained had an independent status from that of the normative and orientational pattern of the social system; the one system cannot be reduced to the other</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, the question of the &quot;cultural capital&quot; of a social system as a sheer historical entity (that is, in its function as a &quot;fiduciary system&quot;), is not identical with the higher cultural values of that system; that is, the cultural system is embodied with a meta-structural logic there cannot be reduced to any given social system or cannot be viewed as a materialist (or behavioralist) deduction from the &quot;necessities&quot; of the social system (or from the &quot;necessities&quot; of its economy)</span>

				<span class='text'>quot; Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association, Atlanta, 2003</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Within this context, culture would have an independent power of transition, not only as factors of actual socio-cultural units (like Western civilization or China) but also in the way original cultural bases would tend to &quot;universalize&quot; through interpenetration and spread over large numbers of social systems as with classical Greece and Israel, where the original social bases had died but where the cultural system survived as an independently &quot;working&quot; cultural pattern, as in the case of Greek philosophy or in the case of Christianity as a modified derivation from its original seed-bed in ancient Israel</span>

				<span class='text'>' Prentice-Hall, Inc</span>
				<span class='text'> Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, 1966</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Parsons and Habermas===The difference between Parsons and [[Jürgen Habermas]] lies essentially in how Habermas uses Parsons' theory to establish the basic propositions of his own</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Habermas, ''The Theory of Communicative Action'' Volume 2</span>
				<span class='text'>''Lifeworld and System: A Critique of Functionalist Reason</span>
				<span class='text'>' Boston: Beacon, 1987</span>
				<span class='text'>(Original, Suhrkamp Verlag, Frankfurt am Main, 1981)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Habermas takes the division between Parsons' separation between the &quot;outer&quot; and the &quot;inner&quot; dimensions of the social system and labels them &quot;system&quot; (outer dimension (A-G)) and &quot;lifeworld&quot; (inner dimension (I-L))</span>
				<span class='text'>The problem with this model from Parsons' point of view is a) that conflict within the social system can in reality emerge from any relational point and not simply from the system-lifeworld dichotomy, and b) by relating the system-lifeworld model to some kind of &quot;liberation&quot;-epic, Habermas produces the Utopian notion that the potentiality of conflict within the social system has some kind of &quot;final solution,&quot; which produces a misleading concept of the nature of systemic conflict</span>
				<span class='text'>==General theory===It is important to highlight that Parsons discriminates between two &quot;meanings&quot; or modes of the term &quot;general theory</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; For some purposes he speaks about general theory as those aspects of theoretical concerns for the field of the social sciences, where the focus is on the most &quot;constitutive&quot; elements of cognitive concern for the basic theoretical systematization of a given field</span>
				<span class='text'>Within these concerns Parsons would include the basic conceptual scheme for the given field, including its highest order of theoretical relations and naturally also the necessary specification of this system's axiomatic, epistemological and methodological foundations from the point of view of logical implications</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;These issues was generally those issues Parsons would discuss in his first major work: Talcott Parsons, ''The Structure of Social Action</span>
				<span class='text'>' New York: McGraw-Hill, 1937</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For another discussion of these questions, see, Rainer C</span>
				<span class='text'>Baum and Victor Lidz, &quot;Introduction to Meta-Theory&quot; In Jan Loubser et al</span>
				<span class='text'>(eds</span>
				<span class='text'> ''Explorations in General Theory in the Social Science: Essays in Honor of Talcott Parsons</span>
				<span class='text'>' New York: The Free Press, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; All these elements would signify the quest for a general theory on the highest level of theoretical concern</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the term general theory also referred to a more fully operational system, which was a system, where the implications of the conceptual scheme was &quot;spelled out&quot; on lower levels of cognitive structuralization, that is, levels standing closer to a perceived &quot;empirical object</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; In his speech to the American Sociological Society in 1947, he spoke of five of such levels</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, &quot;The Prospects of Sociological Theory</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; (1948)</span>
				<span class='text'>In Talcott Parsons, ''Essays in Sociological Theory</span>
				<span class='text'>' New York: The Free Press, 1954</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; These levels were the following:# The General Theory level, which primarily took form as a theory of social systems</span>
				<span class='text'> The theory of motivation of social behavior, which especially addressed questions of the dynamics of the social system and which naturally presupposed theories of motivation, personality and socialization</span>
				<span class='text'> The theoretical bases of systematic comparative analysis of social structure, which for example would involve a study of concrete cultures in concrete systems on various levels of generalization</span>
				<span class='text'> Special theories around particular empirical problem areas</span>
				<span class='text'> The &quot;fitting&quot; of these theories to specific empirical research techniques, such as statistics, survey techniques and so on</span>
				<span class='text'>uring his life Parsons would work on developing all five fields of theoretical concerns but he would pay special attention to the development on the highest &quot;constitutive&quot; level, since the rest of the building would stand or fall on the solidity of the highest level</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;For one discussion of these effort see Jan J</span>
				<span class='text'>Loubser, &quot;General Introduction&quot; in Jan Loubser et al</span>
				<span class='text'>(eds</span>
				<span class='text'> ''Explorations in General Theory in the Social Science: Essays in Honor of Talcott Parsons</span>
				<span class='text'>' New York: The Free Press, 1976</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Contrary to prevailing myths Parsons never thought that modern societies exist in some kind of perfect harmony with their norms or that most modern societies necessary were characterized by some high level of consensus or a &quot;happy&quot; institutional integration</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons highlighted two things in this regard</span>
				<span class='text'>a) It is almost logically impossible that there can be any &quot;perfect fit&quot; or perfect consensus situation in the basic normative structure of complex modern societies because the basic value-pattern of modern societies are generally differentiated in such a way so some of the basic normative categories will exist in inherent conflict with each other if not actually, then at least potentially</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, both freedom and equality is generally viewed as fundamental and in a sense non-negotiable values of modern societies</span>
				<span class='text'>Each represents a kind of ultimate imperative about what the higher values of humanity is all about</span>
				<span class='text'>However, as Parsons emphasizes there does not exist any simple answer to the priority of freedom versus equality or any simple solution to how they possibly can be mediated if at all</span>
				<span class='text'>Therefore, all modern societies are faced with the inherent conflict prevailing between these two values of which there is no &quot;eternal solution&quot; as such</span>
				<span class='text'>For this reason alone, there cannot exist any perfect match between motivational pattern, normative solutions and the prevailing value-pattern in any modern society</span>
				<span class='text'>Parsons would also maintain that the never-ending &quot;dispute&quot; between &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; had something to do with the fact that they both defend ultimately &quot;justified&quot; human values (or ideals), which each on their own terms are indispensable as values but these fundamental values will always exist in an endless conflictual position to each other</span>
				<span class='text'>b) As a general token Parsons always maintained that the integration of normative pattern in society always is problematic and the level of integration reached are in principle always far from harmonious and perfect</span>
				<span class='text'>If some &quot;harmonious pattern&quot; does emerge, then it is related to specific historical circumstances, it is not a general law of the social systems</span>
				<span class='text'>==AGIL paradigm===The heuristic scheme Parsons used to analyze systems and subsystems is called the &quot;[[AGIL Paradigm]]&quot;, &quot;AGIL scheme&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;P</span>
				<span class='text'>McNeill, C</span>
				<span class='text'>Townley, ''Fundamentals of Sociology,'' (Hutchinson Educational, 1981)&lt;/ref&gt; To survive or maintain equilibrium with respect to its environment, any system must to some degree adapt to that environment (Adaptation), attain its goals (Goal Attainment), integrate its components (Integration), and maintain its latent pattern (Latency Pattern Maintenance), a sort of cultural template</span>
				<span class='text'>These concepts can be abbreviated as AGIL</span>
				<span class='text'>These are called the system's functional imperatives</span>
				<span class='text'>It is important to understand that Parsons AGIL model is an analytical scheme for the sake of theoretical &quot;production,&quot; it is not any simple &quot;copy&quot; or any direct historical &quot;summary&quot; of empirical reality</span>
				<span class='text'>Also the scheme itself doesn't explain &quot;anything&quot; as little as the periodical table in the natural sciences explains anything in and by itself</span>
				<span class='text'>The AGIL scheme is a tool for explanations and no better than the quality of those theories and explanation by which it is processed</span>
				<span class='text'>n the case of the analysis of a social action system, the [[AGIL Paradigm]], according to Parsons, yields four interrelated and interpenetrating subsystems: the behavioral systems of its members (A), the personality systems of those members (G), the social system (as such) (I) and the cultural system of that society (L)</span>
				<span class='text'>To analyze a society as a social system (the I subsystem of action), people are posited to enact roles associated with positions</span>
				<span class='text'>These positions and roles become differentiated to some extent and in a modern society are associated with things such as occupational, political, judicial and educational roles</span>
				<span class='text'>onsidering the interrelation of these specialized roles, as well as functionally differentiated collectivities (e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> firms, political parties), the society can be analyzed as a complex system of interrelated functional subsystems, namely:The pure AGIL model for all living systems:* (A) Adaptation</span>
				<span class='text'> (G) Goal Attainment</span>
				<span class='text'> (I) Integration</span>
				<span class='text'> (L) Pattern maintenance</span>
				<span class='text'>(L stand for &quot;Latent function&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>he Social system level:* The economy — social adaptation to its action and non-action environmental systems* The polity — collective goal attainment* The societal community — the integration of its diverse social components* The fiduciary system — processes that function to reproduce historical culture in its &quot;direct&quot; social embeddedness</span>
				<span class='text'>he General Action Level:* The behavioral organism (or system)</span>
				<span class='text'>(In later version, the foci for generalized &quot;intelligence</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'> The personality system</span>
				<span class='text'> The social system</span>
				<span class='text'> The cultural system</span>
				<span class='text'>(See cultural level)</span>
				<span class='text'>he cultural level:* Cognitive symbolization</span>
				<span class='text'> Expressive symbolization</span>
				<span class='text'> Evaluative symbolization</span>
				<span class='text'>(Sometimes called: moral-evaluative symbolization)</span>
				<span class='text'> Constitutive symbolization</span>
				<span class='text'>he Generalized Symbolic media:Social System level:* (A) Economic system: Money</span>
				<span class='text'> (G) Political system: Political power</span>
				<span class='text'> (I) The Societal Community: Influence</span>
				<span class='text'> (L) The Fiduciary system (cultural tradition): Value-commitment</span>
				<span class='text'>arsons elaborated upon the idea that each of these systems also developed some specialized symbolic mechanisms of interaction analogous to money in the economy, e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>, influence in the social community</span>
				<span class='text'>Various processes of &quot;interchange&quot; among the subsystems of the social system were postulated</span>
				<span class='text'>arsons' use of social systems analysis based on the AGIL scheme was established in his work ''Economy and Society'' (with N</span>
				<span class='text'>Smelser, 1956) and has prevailed in all his work ever since</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the AGIL system does only exist in a &quot;rudimentary&quot; form in the beginning and is then gradually elaborated and expanded in the decades which followed</span>
				<span class='text'>A brief introduction to Parsons' AGIL scheme can be found in chapter 2 of ''The American University'' (with G</span>
				<span class='text'>Platt, 1973)</span>
				<span class='text'>There is, however, no single place in Parsons writing where the total AGIL system is visually displayed or explained—the complete system have to be reconstructed from multiple places in his writing</span>
				<span class='text'>The system displayed in &quot;The American University&quot; is only the most basic elements and should not be mistaken for the whole system</span>
				<span class='text'>==Social evolutionism===Parsons contributed to the field of [[social evolutionism]] and [[neoevolutionism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He divided evolution into four sub-processes:# differentiation, which creates functional subsystems of the main system, as discussed above;# adaptation, where those systems evolve into more efficient versions;# inclusion of elements previously excluded from the given systems; # generalization of values, increasing the legitimization of the increasingly complex system</span>
				<span class='text'>urthermore, Parsons explored these sub-processes within three stages of evolution:# primitive,# archaic and# modernParsons viewed [[Western culture|Western civilisation]] as the pinnacle of modern societies, and out of all western cultures he declared the United States as the most dynamically developed</span>
				<span class='text'>arsons' late work focused on a new theoretical synthesis around four functions common (he claimed) to all systems of action—from the behavioral to the cultural, and a set of symbolic media that enable communication across them</span>
				<span class='text'>His attempt to structure the world of action according to a scheme that focused on order was unacceptable for American sociologists, who were at that time retreating from the grand pretensions of the 1960s to a more empirical, grounded approach</span>
				<span class='text'>==Pattern variables===Parsons asserted that there were not two dimensions to societies: instrumental and expressive</span>
				<span class='text'>By this he meant that there are qualitative differences between kinds of social interaction</span>
				<span class='text'>e observed that people can have personalized and formally detached relationships based on the roles that they play</span>
				<span class='text'>The characteristics that were associated with each kind of interaction he called the ''pattern variables''</span>
				<span class='text'>n interaction can be characterized by one identifier of each contrastive pair:* affectivity - affective neutrality* self-orientation - collectivity-orientation* universalism - particularism* ascription - achievement* specificity - diffusity===Influences===For many years Parsons was the best-known sociologist in the [[United States]], and indeed one of the most influential and most controversial sociologists in the world</span>
				<span class='text'>His work was very influential well into the 1960s, particularly in the [[United States]], until it met with extensive criticism and was generally dismissed by the 1970s</span>
				<span class='text'>Currently, interest in Parsons is increasing worldwide</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite the traditional view that Parsons' theories are unsatisfactory if not inaccessible, prominent attempts to revive Parsonian thinking have been made by Parsonsian sociologists and social scientists like [[Jeffrey Alexander]], [[Bryan S</span>
				<span class='text'>Turner (sociologist)|Bryan S</span>

				<span class='text'>Nichols, and Jens Kaalhauge Nielsen have been most prominent</span>
				<span class='text'>The key centers of Parsons interest today beside the US are Germany, Japan, Italy, and the United Kingdom</span>
				<span class='text'>arsons had a seminal influence and early mentorship of many American and international scholars among them [[Ralf Dahrendorf]], [[Alain Touraine]], [[Niklas Luhmann]] and [[Jürgen Habermas]]</span>
