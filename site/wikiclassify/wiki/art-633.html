				<span class='text'>] 985 or 995&amp;nbsp;– 12 November 1035), more commonly known as '''Canute''', was a king of [[Denmark]], [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Norway]] and parts of [[Sweden]], together often referred to as the Anglo-Scandinavian or [[North Sea Empire]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After his death, the deaths of his heirs within a decade, and the [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066, his legacy was largely lost to history</span>
				<span class='text'>The medieval historian [[Norman F</span>
				<span class='text'>Cantor|Norman Cantor]] has made the statement that he was &quot;the most effective king in Anglo-Saxon history&quot;, although Cnut himself was Danish not British or [[Anglo-Saxon]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cantor, ''The Civilisation of the Middle Ages'', 1995:166</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Cnut's name is popularly invoked in the context of the legendary story of ''[[King Canute and the waves]]'', but usually misrepresenting Cnut (Canute) as a deluded monarch believing he had supernatural powers, when the original story in fact relates the opposite and portrays a wise king</span>
				<span class='text'>nut's father was [[Sweyn Forkbeard]], King of Denmark (which gave Cnut the [[patronym]] ''Sweynsson'', Old Norse ''Sveinsson'')</span>
				<span class='text'>The identity of his mother is uncertain, although medieval tradition makes her a daughter of [[Mieszko I]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;mother&quot;/&gt;As a Danish prince, Cnut won the throne of England in 1016 in the wake of [[Viking Age#Northwestern Europe|centuries of Viking activity in northwestern Europe]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His accession to the Danish throne in 1018 brought the crowns of England and Denmark together</span>
				<span class='text'>Cnut maintained his power by uniting Danes and English under cultural bonds of wealth and custom, rather than by sheer brutality</span>
				<span class='text'>After a decade of conflict with opponents in [[Scandinavia]], Cnut claimed the crown of Norway in [[Trondheim]] in 1028</span>
				<span class='text'>The Swedish city [[Sigtuna]] was held by Cnut</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He had coins struck there that called him king, but there is no narrative record of his occupation</span>
				<span class='text'>he kingship of England lent the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] an important link to the maritime zone between the islands of [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]], where Cnut, like his father before him, had a strong interest and wielded much influence among the [[Norse-Gaels]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Cnut's possession of England's [[diocese]]s and the continental Diocese of Denmark&amp;nbsp;– with a claim laid upon it by the [[Holy Roman Empire]]'s [[Archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen]]—was a source of great leverage within the [[Catholic Church#Middle Ages|Catholic Church]], gaining notable concessions from [[Pope Benedict VIII]] and his successor [[John XIX]], such as one on the price of the [[pallium]] of his bishops</span>
				<span class='text'>Cnut also gained concessions on the tolls his people had to pay on the way to [[Rome]] from other magnates of medieval [[Christendom]], at the coronation of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After his 1026 victory against Norway and Sweden, and on his way to Rome for this coronation, Cnut, in a letter written for the benefit of his subjects, stated himself &quot;King of all England and Denmark and the Norwegians and of some of the Swedes&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;==Birth and kingship==[[File:Cnut lands</span>
				<span class='text'>vg|thumb|North Sea Empire of Cnut the Great, ca 1030]]Cnut was a son of the Danish Prince [[Sweyn Forkbeard]], who was the son and heir to King Harald Bluetooth from a line of Scandinavian rulers central to the unification of Denmark</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Trow, ''Cnut'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>30–31</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Neither the place nor the date of his birth are known</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Harthacnut I of Denmark|Harthacnut]] was the semi-legendary founder of the Danish royal house at the beginning of the 10th century, and his son, [[Gorm the Old]], was the first in the official line (the 'Old' in his name being to this effect)</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Harald Bluetooth]], Gorm's son and Cnut's grandfather, was the Danish king at the time of the [[Christianization of Scandinavia#Denmark|Christianisation of Denmark]], the first Scandinavian king to accept Christianity</span>
				<span class='text'>Cnut was two years old when his grandfather, Harald Bluetooth, died, and his father, Sweyn Forkbeard, assumed the throne</span>
				<span class='text'>{anchor|Mother}}The ''[[Thietmar of Merseburg#Thietmar's Chronicle|Chronicon]]'' of [[Thietmar of Merseburg]] and the ''[[Encomium Emmae]]''  report Cnut's mother as having been a daughter of [[Mieszko I of Poland]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[Old Norse literature|Norse]] sources of the [[High Middle Ages]], most prominently ''[[Heimskringla]]'' by [[Snorri Sturluson]], also give a Polish princess as Cnut's mother, whom they call [[Gunhild of Wenden|Gunhild]] and a daughter of ''[[Burislav]]'', the king of ''[[Wends|Vindland]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Snorri, ''Heimskringla'', ''The History of Olav Trygvason'', ch</span>
				<span class='text'>34, p</span>
				<span class='text'>141&lt;/ref&gt;Since in the [[Saga|Norse sagas]] the ''king of Vindland'' is always ''Burislav'', this is reconcilable with the assumption that her father was Mieszko (not his son [[Bolesław I Chrobry|Bolesław]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Adam of Bremen in ''[[Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum]]'' is unique in equating Cnut's mother (for whom he also produces no name) with the former queen of [[Kingdom of Sweden|Sweden]], wife of [[Eric the Victorious]] and by this marriage mother of [[Olof Skötkonung]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Adam of Bremen, ''History of the Archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen'', Book II, ch</span>
				<span class='text'>37; see also Book II, ch</span>
				<span class='text'>33, Scholion 25&lt;/ref&gt;To complicate the matter, ''Heimskringla'' and other Sagas also have Sweyn marrying Eric's widow, but she is distinctly another person in these texts, by name of ''[[Sigrid the Haughty]]'', whom Sweyn only marries after ''Gunhild'', the Slavic princess who bore Cnut, has died</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Snorri, ''Heimskringla'', ''The History of Olav Trygvason'', ch</span>
				<span class='text'>91, p</span>
				<span class='text'>184&lt;/ref&gt;Different theories regarding the number and ancestry of Sweyn's wives (or wife) have been brought forward (see [[Sigrid the Haughty]] and [[Gunhild of Wenden|Gunhild]])</span>
				<span class='text'>But since Adam is the only source to equate the identity of Cnut's and Olof Skötkonung's mother, this is often seen as an error of Adam, and it is often assumed that Sweyn had two wives, the first being Cnut's mother, and the second being the former Queen of Sweden</span>
				<span class='text'>nut's brother [[Harald II of Denmark|Harald]] was the first born and [[crown prince]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ome hint of Cnut's childhood can be found in the ''[[Flateyjarbók]]'', a 13th-century source, stating at one point that Cnut was taught his soldiery by the chieftain [[Thorkell the Tall]],&lt;ref&gt;Trow, ''Cnut'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>44</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; brother to [[Sigvaldi Strut-Haraldsson|Sigurd]], [[Jarl (title)|Jarl]] of mythical [[Jomsborg]], and the legendary [[Jomvikings|Joms]], at their [[Viking]] stronghold on the island of [[Wolin|Wollin]], off the coast of [[Pomerania]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His date of birth, like his mother's name, is unknown</span>
				<span class='text'>Contemporary works such as the ''[[Thietmar of Merseburg#Thietmar's Chronicle|Chronicon]]'' and the ''[[Encomium Emmae]]'', do not mention it</span>
				<span class='text'>Even so, in a ''[[Knútsdrápa (Óttarr svarti)|Knútsdrápa]]'' by the [[skald]] [[Óttarr svarti]], there is a statement that Cnut was &quot;of no great age&quot; when he first went to war</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Douglas, ''English Historical Documents'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>335–336&lt;/ref&gt; It also mentions a battle identifiable with Sweyn Forkbeard's invasion of England and attack on the city of [[Norwich]], in 1003/04, after the [[St</span>
				<span class='text'>Brice's Day massacre]] of Danes by the English, in 1002</span>
				<span class='text'>If it is the case that Cnut was part of this, his birthdate may be near 990, or even 980</span>
				<span class='text'>If not, and the skald's poetic verse envisages another assault, such as Forkbeard's conquest of England in 1013/14, it may even suggest a birth date nearer 1000</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lawson, ''Cnut'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>160</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; There is a passage of the Encomiast's (as the author of the ''Encomium Emmae'' is known) with a reference to the force Cnut led in his English conquest of 1015/16</span>
				<span class='text'>Here ([[Cnut the Great#Conquest of England|see below]]) it says all the Vikings were of &quot;mature age&quot; under Cnut &quot;the king&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>171&lt;/ref&gt; However, the English nobility took a different view, and the [[Witenagemot]] recalled Aethelred from Normandy</span>
				<span class='text'>The restored king swiftly led an army against Cnut, who fled with his army to Denmark, along the way mutilating the hostages they had taken and abandoning them on the beach at [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Sawyer, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>171&quot;/&gt; Harald is thought to have offered Cnut command of his forces for another invasion of England, on the condition he did not continue to press his claim</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Sawyer, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>171&quot;/&gt; In any case, Cnut was able to assemble a large fleet with which to launch another invasion</span>

				<span class='text'>She had been sent away by their father after the death of the Swedish king [[Eric the Victorious]] in 995, and his marriage to [[Sigrid the Haughty]], the Swedish [[queen mother]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Eiríkr's participation in the invasion left his son Hakon to rule Norway, with Svein</span>

				<span class='text'>At this point Eadric Streona went over to Edmund,&lt;ref&gt;''Anglo-Saxon Chronicles'', pp</span>

				<span class='text'>In the ensuing struggle, Eadric Streona, whose return to the English side had perhaps only been a ruse, withdrew his forces from the fray, bringing about a decisive English defeat</span>

				<span class='text'>With Edmund dead, Cnut was quick to eliminate any prospective challenge from the survivors of the Wessex dynasty</span>
				<span class='text'>The first year of his reign was marked by the executions of a number of English noblemen whom he considered suspect</span>

				<span class='text'>n 1018, having collected a [[Danegeld]] amounting to the colossal sum of £72,000 levied nationwide, with an additional £10,500 extracted from London, Cnut paid off his army and sent most of them home</span>
				<span class='text'>He retained 40 ships and their crews as a standing force in England</span>

				<span class='text'>The officials responsible for these provinces were designated [[earl]]s, a title of Scandinavian origin already in localised use in England, which now everywhere replaced that of ealdorman</span>
				<span class='text'>Wessex was initially kept under Cnut's personal control, while Northumbria went to [[Erik of Hlathir]], [[East Anglia]] to [[Thorkell the Tall]], and Mercia remained in the hands of [[Eadric Streona]]</span>

				<span class='text'>[[Bernicia]], the northern part of Northumbria, was theoretically part of Erik and Siward's earldom, but throughout Cnut's reign it effectively remained under the control of the English dynasty based at [[Bamburgh]], which had dominated the area at least since the early 10th century</span>
				<span class='text'>They served as junior Earls of Bernicia under the titular authority of the Earl of Northumbria</span>
				<span class='text'>By the 1030s Cnut's direct administration of Wessex had come to an end, with the establishment of an earldom under [[Godwin, Earl of Wessex|Godwin]], an Englishman from a powerful [[Sussex]] family</span>
				<span class='text'>In general, after initial reliance on his Scandinavian followers in the first years of his reign, Cnut allowed those Anglo-Saxon families of the existing English nobility who had earned his trust to assume rulership of his Earldoms</span>

				<span class='text'>]Cnut was generally remembered as a wise and successful king of England, although this view may in part be attributable to his good treatment of the Church, keeper of the historic record</span>
				<span class='text'>Accordingly, we hear of him, even today, as a religious man ([[Cnut the Great#Ruler of the waves|see below]]), despite the fact that he was in an arguably [[sin]]ful relationship, with two wives, and the harsh treatment he dealt his fellow Christian opponents</span>

				<span class='text'>198&lt;/ref&gt; His campaigns abroad meant the tables of Viking supremacy were stacked in favour of the English, turning the prows of the longships towards Scandinavia</span>

				<span class='text'>It seems there were Danes in opposition to him, and an attack he carried out on the [[Wends]] of [[Pomerania]] may have had something to do with this</span>

				<span class='text'>The banishment of Thorkell the Tall in 1021 may be seen in relation to the attack on the Wends for the death of [[Olof Skötkonung]] in 1022, and the succession to the Swedish throne of his son, [[Anund Jacob of Sweden|Anund Jacob]], bringing Sweden into alliance with Norway</span>

				<span class='text'>hen [[Olaf II of Norway|Olaf Haraldsson]] and Anund Jakob took advantage of Cnut's commitment to England and began to launch attacks against Denmark, Ulf gave the freemen cause to accept Harthacnut, still a child, as king</span>
				<span class='text'>This was a ruse on Ulf's part since his role as caretaker of Harthacnut gave him the reign of the kingdom</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon news of these events, Cnut set sail for Denmark to restore himself and to deal with Ulf, who then got back in line</span>
				<span class='text'>In a battle known as the [[Battle of the Helgeå]], Cnut and his men fought the Norwegians and Swedes at the mouth of the river Helgea, probably in 1026, and the apparent victory left Cnut as the dominant leader in Scandinavia</span>
				<span class='text'>Ulf the usurper's realignment and participation in the battle did not, in the end, earn him Cnut's forgiveness</span>
				<span class='text'>Some sources state that the brothers-in-law were playing [[chess]] at a banquet in [[Roskilde]] when an argument arose between them, and the next day, [[Christmas]] 1026, one of Cnut's [[housecarl]]s killed the jarl with his blessing, in Trinity Church, the predecessor to [[Roskilde Cathedral]]</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;/&gt;{{clarify|date=June 2013}}==Relations with the Church==Cnut's actions as a Viking conqueror and his ruthless treatment of the overthrown dynasty had made him uneasy with the Church</span>
				<span class='text'>He was already a Christian before he was king—being named ''Lambert'' at his baptism&lt;ref&gt;Adam of Bremen, ''Gesta Daenorum'', scholium 37, p</span>
				<span class='text'>112</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, ''Cnut'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>121&lt;/ref&gt;—although the [[Christianization of Scandinavia]] was not at all complete</span>
				<span class='text'>His open relationship with a [[Concubinage|concubine]], [[Ælfgifu of Northampton]], his [[History of marriage in Great Britain and Ireland|handfast]] wife, whom he kept as his northern queen when he wed [[Emma of Normandy]] (confusingly also Ælfgifu in Old English), who was kept in the south with an estate in [[Exeter]], was another conflict with church doctrine</span>
				<span class='text'>In an effort to reconcile himself with his churchmen, Cnut repaired all the English churches and monasteries that were victims of Viking plunder and refilled their coffers</span>
				<span class='text'>He also built new churches and was an earnest patron of monastic communities</span>
				<span class='text'>His homeland of Denmark was a Christian nation on the rise, and the desire to enhance the religion was still fresh</span>
				<span class='text'>As an example, the first stone church recorded to have been built in Scandinavia was in [[Roskilde]], c</span>
				<span class='text'>1027, and its patron was Cnut's sister Estrid</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Olsen, ''Christianity &amp; Churches'', in Roesdahl &amp; Wilson (eds) ''From Viking to Crusader&amp;nbsp;– The Scandinavians &amp; Europe 800–1200''&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Canute and Ælfgifu</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|250px|Angels crown Cnut as he and Ælfgifu present a large gold cross to [[Hyde Abbey]]</span>
				<span class='text'>]It is difficult to ascertain whether Cnut's attitude towards the Church derived from deep religious devotion or was merely a means to reinforce his regime's hold on the people</span>
				<span class='text'>There is evidence of respect for the Viking religion in his praise poetry, which he was happy enough for his ''skalds'' to embellish in [[Norse mythology]], while other Viking leaders were insistent on the rigid observation of the Christian line, like [[Olaf II of Norway|St Olaf]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Trow, ''Cnut'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>29&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet he also displays the desire for a respectable Christian nationhood within Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1018, some sources suggest he was at Canterbury on the return of its Archbishop [[Lyfing (Archbishop of Canterbury)|Lyfing]] from Rome, to receive letters of exhortation from the Pope</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lawson, ''Cnut'', P</span>
				<span class='text'>6&lt;/ref&gt; If this chronology is correct, he probably went from Canterbury to the Witan at Oxford, with Archbishop [[Wulfstan II|Wulfstan]] of York in attendance, to record the event</span>

				<span class='text'>7&quot;&gt;Lawson, ''Cnut'', P</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lawson, ''Cnut'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>39–147&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly held land was given, along with exemption from taxes as well as [[relic]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Canterbury Cathedral|Christ Church]] was probably given rights at the important port of Sandwich as well as tax exemption, with confirmation in the placement of their charters on the altar,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lawson, Cnut, P</span>

				<span class='text'>26&lt;/ref&gt; was given to it</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Old Minster, Winchester|Old Minster]] was the recipient of a [[shrine]] for the relics of [[Birinus|St Birinus]] and the probable confirmation of its privileges</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Lawson, Cnut, p</span>
				<span class='text'>42&quot;/&gt; The monastery at Evesham, with its Abbot Ælfweard purportedly a relative of the king through Ælfgifu the Lady (probably Ælfgifu of Northampton, rather than Queen Emma, also known as Ælfgifu), got the relics of [[Wigstan of Mercia|St Wigstan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lawson, ''Cnut'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>43&lt;/ref&gt; Cnut's generosity towards his subjects, which his skalds called ''destroying treasure'',&lt;ref&gt;Trow, ''Cnut'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>28&lt;/ref&gt; was of course popular with the English</span>
				<span class='text'>Still, it is important to remember that not all Englishmen were in his favour, and the burden of taxation was widely felt</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lawson, ''Cnut'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>47&lt;/ref&gt; His attitude towards London's see was clearly not benign</span>
				<span class='text'>The monasteries at [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]] and [[Glastonbury]] were apparently not on good terms either</span>
				<span class='text'>Other gifts were also given to his neighbours</span>
				<span class='text'>Among these were a gift to [[Chartres]], of which its bishop wrote, &quot;When we saw the gift that you sent us, we were amazed at your knowledge as well as your faith&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>since you, whom we had heard to be a pagan prince, we now know to be not only a Christian, but also a most generous donor to God's churches and servants&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Lawson, Cnut, p</span>
				<span class='text'>42&quot;/&gt; He is known to have sent a [[psalter]] and [[sacramentary]] made in [[Peterborough]], famous for its [[Illuminated manuscript|illustrations]], to [[Cologne]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Lawson, Cnut, p</span>
				<span class='text'>46&quot;&gt;Lawson, ''Cnut'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>46&lt;/ref&gt; and a book written in gold, among other gifts, to [[William V, Duke of Aquitaine|William the Great]] of [[Aquitaine]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Lawson, Cnut, p</span>
				<span class='text'>46&quot;/&gt; This golden book was apparently to support Aquitanian claims of [[Saint Martial|St Martial]], patron saint of Aquitaine, as an [[Apostle (Christian)|apostle]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lawson, ''Cnut'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>44&lt;/ref&gt; Of some consequence, its recipient was an avid [[artisan]], [[Scholarly method|scholar]], and devout Christian, and the [[Abbey of Saint Martial, Limoges|Abbey of Saint-Martial]] was a great [[library]] and [[scriptorium]], second only to the one at [[Cluny]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It is probable that Cnut's gifts were well beyond anything we can now prove</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Lawson, Cnut, p</span>
				<span class='text'>46&quot;/&gt;Cnut's journey to Rome in 1027 is another sign of his dedication to the Christian religion</span>
				<span class='text'>It may be that he went to attend the coronation of Conrad II in order to improve relations between the two powers, yet he had previously made a vow to seek the favour of St Peter, the keeper of the keys to the heavenly kingdom</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lawson, ''Cnut'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>45&lt;/ref&gt; While in Rome, Cnut made an agreement with the Pope to reduce the fees paid by the English archbishops to receive their pallium</span>
				<span class='text'>He also arranged that travellers from his realm should pay reduced or no tolls, and that they should be safeguarded on their way to and from Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>Some evidence exists for a second journey in 1030</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Trow, ''Cnut'', p</span>

				<span class='text'>=Family tree=={{Cnut the Great family tree}}==Cnut's ''skalds''==The Old Norse catalogue of [[skald]]s known as ''[[Skáldatal]]'' lists eight skalds who were active at Cnut's court</span>
				<span class='text'>Four of them, namely [[Sigvatr Þórðarson]], [[Óttarr svarti]], [[Þórarinn loftunga]] and [[Hallvarðr Háreksblesi|Hallvarðr háreksblesi]], composed verses in honour of Cnut which have survived in some form, while no such thing is apparent from the four other skalds [[Bersi Skáldtorfuson|Bersi Torfuson]], [[Arnórr jarlaskáld|Arnórr Þórðarson jarlaskáld]] (known from other works), Steinn Skaptason and Óðarkeptr (unknown)</span>
				<span class='text'>It was these skalds who first referred to his greatness with emphasis on his generosity to the church and military achievements</span>
				<span class='text'>The principal works for Cnut are the three ''[[Knútsdrápa|Knútsdrápur]]'' by [[Sigvatr Þórðarson]], [[Óttarr svarti]] and [[Hallvarðr Háreksblesi|Hallvarðr háreksblesi]], and the ''Höfuðlausn'' and ''[[Tøgdrápa]]'' by [[Þórarinn loftunga]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Cnut also features in two other contemporary skaldic poems, namely [[Þórðr Kolbeinsson]]'s ''Eiríksdrápa'' and the anonymous ''[[Liðsmannaflokkr]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>nut's skalds emphasise the parallelism between Cnut's rule of his earthly kingdom and God's rule of Heaven</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lawson, ''Cnut'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>126&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly apparent in their refrains</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus the refrain of Þórarinn's ''Höfuðlausn'' translates to &quot;Cnut protects the land as the guardian of Byzantium [God] [does] Heaven&quot; and the refrain of Hallvarðr's ''Knútsdrápa'' translates to &quot;Cnut protects the land as the Lord of all [does] the splendid hall of the mountains [Heaven]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Frank 1999:116</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Despite the Christian message, the poets also make use of traditional pagan references and this is particularly true of Hallvarðr</span>
				<span class='text'>As an example, one of his half-stanzas translates to &quot;The Freyr of the noise of weapons [warrior] has also cast under him Norway; the battle-server [warrior] diminishes the hunger of the [[valcyrie]]'s hawks [ravens]</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Frank 1999:120</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The skald here refers to Cnut as &quot;Freyr of battle&quot;, a [[kenning]] using the name of the pagan god [[Freyr]]</span>
				<span class='text'>References of this sort were avoided by poets composing for the contemporary kings of Norway but Cnut seems to have had a more relaxed attitude towards pagan literary allusions</span>
