				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=56: &quot;Hard to see why Mimi wanted John, as she had always said she didn't want children&quot;}} His aunt purchased volumes of short stories for him, and his uncle, a dairyman at his family's farm, bought him a mouth organ and engaged him in solving {{linktext|crossword}} puzzles</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=45}} As Mimi was sceptical of his claim that he would be famous one day, she hoped he would grow bored with music, often telling him, &quot;The guitar's all very well, John, but you'll never make a living out of it&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Named after Quarry Bank High School, the group was established by him in September 1956</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=738}} By the summer of 1957, the Quarrymen played a &quot;spirited set of songs&quot; made up of half skiffle and half [[rock and roll]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=95}} Lennon first met Paul McCartney at the Quarrymen's second performance, held in Woolton on 6 July at the St</span>
				<span class='text'>Peter's Church garden fête, after which he asked McCartney to join the band</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=93–99}}McCartney says that Aunt Mimi &quot;was very aware that John's friends were lower class&quot;, and would often patronise him when he arrived to visit Lennon</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Miles|1997|p=44}} According to Paul's brother Mike, McCartney's father was also disapproving, declaring Lennon would get his son &quot;into trouble&quot;,{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=32}} although he later allowed the fledgling band to rehearse in the McCartneys' front room at [[20 Forthlin Road|20{{nbsp}}Forthlin Road]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=38–39}}{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=47}} During this time, the 18-year-old Lennon wrote his first song, &quot;[[Hello Little Girl]]&quot;, a UK top 10 hit for [[The Fourmost]] nearly five years later</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=337–338}}McCartney suggested his friend [[George Harrison]] as the lead guitarist</span>

				<span class='text'>Like the other band members, Lennon was introduced to [[Preludin]] while in Hamburg,{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=66–67}} and regularly took the drug, as well as [[amphetamines]], as a stimulant during their long, overnight performances</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=57}}[[Brian Epstein]], the Beatles' manager from 1962, had no prior experience of artist management, but had a strong influence on their early dress code and attitude on stage</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=67}} Lennon initially resisted his attempts to encourage the band to present a professional appearance, but eventually complied, saying, &quot;I'll wear a bloody balloon if somebody's going to pay me&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Frankel|2007}} McCartney took over on bass after Sutcliffe decided to stay in Hamburg, and drummer [[Ringo Starr]] replaced Best, completing the four-piece line-up that would endure until the group's break-up in 1970</span>
				<span class='text'>The band's first single, &quot;[[Love Me Do]]&quot;, was released in October 1962 and reached No</span>

				<span class='text'>They recorded their debut album, ''[[Please Please Me]]'', in under 10 hours on 11 February 1963,{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=721}} a day when Lennon was suffering the effects of a cold,{{sfn|Lewisohn |1988|pp=24–26: &quot;Twist and Shout, which had to be recorded last because John Lennon had a particularly bad cold&quot;}} which is evident in the vocal on the last song to be recorded that day, &quot;[[Twist and Shout]]&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>His marriage began just as [[Beatlemania in the United Kingdom|Beatlemania]] took hold across the UK</span>
				<span class='text'>He performed on the evening of his wedding day, and would continue to do so almost daily from then on</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=493–495}} Epstein, fearing that fans would be alienated by the idea of a married Beatle, asked the Lennons to keep their marriage secret</span>
				<span class='text'>Julian was born on 8 April 1963; Lennon was on tour at the time and did not see his son until three days later</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=113}}Cynthia attributed the start of the marriage breakdown to LSD, and as a result, she felt that he slowly lost interest in her</span>

				<span class='text'>Epstein was homosexual</span>
				<span class='text'>According to biographer [[Philip Norman (author)|Philip Norman]], one of his reasons for wanting to manage the group was that he was physically attracted to Lennon</span>
				<span class='text'>Almost as soon as Julian was born, Lennon went on holiday to Spain with Epstein, leading to speculation about their relationship</span>
				<span class='text'>Questioned about it later, Lennon said, &quot;Well, it was almost a love affair, but not quite</span>
				<span class='text'>It was never consummated</span>
				<span class='text'>But it was a pretty intense relationship</span>
				<span class='text'>It was my first experience with a homosexual that I was conscious was homosexual</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=232}} Soon after their return from Spain, at McCartney's twenty-first birthday party in June 1963, Lennon physically attacked Cavern Club MC [[Bob Wooler]] for saying &quot;How was your honeymoon, John?&quot; The MC, known for his wordplay and affectionate but cutting remarks, was making a joke,{{sfn|Harry|2000a|pp=1165, 1169}} but ten months had passed since Lennon's marriage, and the honeymoon, deferred, was still two months in the future</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lennon|2005|pp=94, 119–120}} To Lennon, who was intoxicated with alcohol at the time, the matter was simple: &quot;He called me a [[queer]] so I battered his bloody ribs in&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=1169}}Lennon delighted in mocking Epstein for his homosexuality and for the fact that he was Jewish</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|150px|[[Julian Lennon]] at the unveiling of the [[John Lennon Peace Monument]] in Liverpool, October 2010]]Lennon's first son, Julian, was born as his commitments with the Beatles intensified [[Beatlemania in the United Kingdom|at the height of Beatlemania]] during his marriage to Cynthia</span>
				<span class='text'>Lennon was touring with the Beatles when Julian was born on 8 April 1963</span>
				<span class='text'>Julian's birth, like his mother Cynthia's marriage to Lennon, was kept secret because Epstein was convinced public knowledge of such things would threaten the Beatles' commercial success</span>
				<span class='text'>Julian recalls how some four years later, as a small child in [[Weybridge]], &quot;I was trundled home from school and came walking up with one of my watercolour paintings</span>
				<span class='text'>It was just a bunch of stars and this blonde girl I knew at school</span>
				<span class='text'>And Dad said, 'What's this?' I said, 'It's Lucy in the sky with diamonds</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=517}} Lennon used it as the title of a [[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds|Beatles song]], and though it was later reported to have been derived from the initials [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], Lennon insisted, &quot;It's not an acid song</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=574}} McCartney corroborated Lennon's explanation that Julian innocently came up with the name</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=574}} Lennon was distant from Julian, who felt closer to McCartney than to his father</span>
				<span class='text'>During a car journey to visit Cynthia and Julian during Lennon's divorce, McCartney composed a song, &quot;Hey Jules&quot;, to comfort him</span>
				<span class='text'>It would evolve into the Beatles song &quot;[[Hey Jude]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Lennon later said, &quot;That's his best song</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=341}}Lennon's relationship with Julian was already strained, and after Lennon and Ono's 1971 move to New York, Julian would not see his father again until 1973</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Pang|2008|loc=back cover}} With Pang's encouragement, it was arranged for him (and his mother) to visit Lennon in Los Angeles, where they went to [[Disneyland]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lennon|2005|pp=252–255}} Julian started to see his father regularly, and Lennon gave him a drumming part on a ''[[Walls and Bridges]]'' track</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=258}} He bought Julian a [[Gibson Les Paul]] guitar and other instruments, and encouraged his interest in music by demonstrating guitar chord techniques</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Times Online|2009}}In a ''Playboy'' interview with David Sheff shortly before his death, Lennon said, &quot;Sean was a planned child, and therein lies the difference</span>

				<span class='text'>According to the first, told by the Lennons, on 9 November 1966 Lennon went to the [[Indica Gallery]] in London, where Ono was preparing her conceptual art exhibit, and they were introduced by gallery owner [[John Dunbar (artist)|John Dunbar]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=682}} Lennon was intrigued by Ono's &quot;Hammer A Nail&quot;: patrons hammered a nail into a wooden board, creating the art piece</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the exhibition had not yet begun, Lennon wanted to hammer a nail into the clean board, but Ono stopped him</span>
				<span class='text'>Dunbar asked her, &quot;Don't you know who this is? He's a millionaire! He might buy it</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Ono had supposedly not heard of the Beatles, but relented on condition that Lennon pay her five [[wikt:shilling|shillings]], to which Lennon replied, &quot;I'll give you an imaginary five shillings and hammer an imaginary nail in</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Sheff|1981}} The second version, told by McCartney, is that in late 1965, Ono was in London compiling original musical scores for a book [[John Cage]] was working on, ''[[Notations]]'', but McCartney declined to give her any of his own manuscripts for the book, suggesting that Lennon might oblige</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Miles|1997|p=272}}Ono began visiting and telephoning Lennon's home and, when his wife asked for an explanation, Lennon explained that Ono was only trying to obtain money for her &quot;avant-garde bullshit&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=276}} They often combined advocacy with performance art, as in their &quot;[[Bagism]]&quot;, first introduced during a Vienna press conference</span>
