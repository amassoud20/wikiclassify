				<span class='text'>The first settled line-up consisted of [[Brian Jones]] (guitar, harmonica), [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]] (piano), [[Mick Jagger]] (lead vocals, harmonica), [[Keith Richards]] (guitar), [[Bill Wyman]] (bass) and [[Charlie Watts]] (drums)</span>
				<span class='text'>Stewart was removed from the official line-up in 1963 but continued as an occasional pianist until his death in 1985</span>
				<span class='text'>Jones departed the band less than a month prior to his death in 1969, having already been replaced by [[Mick Taylor]], who remained until 1975</span>
				<span class='text'>Subsequently, [[Ronnie Wood]] has been on guitar in tandem with Richards</span>
				<span class='text'>Following Wyman's departure in 1993, [[Darryl Jones]] has been the main bassist</span>
				<span class='text'>Other notable keyboardists for the band have included [[Nicky Hopkins]], active from 1967 to 1982; [[Billy Preston]] through the mid 1970s (most prominent on ''[[Black and Blue]]'') and [[Chuck Leavell]], active since 1982</span>
				<span class='text'>The band was first led by Jones but after teaming as the band's songwriters, Jagger and Richards assumed ''[[De facto standard|de facto]]'' leadership</span>
				<span class='text'>he Rolling Stones were in the vanguard of the [[British Invasion]] of bands that became popular in the US in 1964–65</span>
				<span class='text'>At first noted for their longish hair as much as their music, the band are identified with the youthful and rebellious [[counterculture of the 1960s]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Critic Sean Egan states that within a year of the release of their 1964 debut album, they &quot;were being perceived by the youth of Britain and then the world as representatives of opposition to an old, cruel order — the antidote to a class-bound, authoritarian culture</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; They were instrumental in making blues a major part of rock and roll and of changing the international focus of blues culture to the original type blues typified by [[Chess Records]] artists such as [[Muddy Waters]]—writer of &quot;[[Rollin' Stone]]&quot;, after which the band is named</span>
				<span class='text'>After a short period of musical experimentation that culminated with the polarising and largely [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] album ''[[Their Satanic Majesties Request]]'' (1967), the group returned to its bluesy roots with ''[[Beggars' Banquet]]'' (1968) which—along with its follow-ups, ''[[Let It Bleed]]'' (1969), ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'' (1971) and ''[[Exile on Main St</span>
				<span class='text'>]'' (1972)—is generally considered to be the band's best work and are considered the Rolling Stones' &quot;Golden Age&quot;</span>
