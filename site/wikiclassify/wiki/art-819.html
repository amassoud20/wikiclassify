				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''Ivan Ivanovich Bering'''&lt;ref name=&quot;armstrong161&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Armstrong|1982|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Denmark|Danish]] born explorer in Russian service, and an officer in the [[Russian Navy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He is known for his two explorations of the north-eastern coast of the Asian continent and from there the western coast on the North American continent</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Bering Strait]], the [[Bering Sea]], [[Bering Island]], the [[Bering Glacier]] and the [[Bering Land Bridge]] have since all been (posthumously) named in his honour</span>
				<span class='text'>aking to the seas at the age of 18, Bering travelled extensively over the next eight years, as well as taking naval training at Amsterdam</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1704, he enrolled with the rapidly expanding Russian navy of [[Peter the Great]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After serving with the navy in significant but non-combat roles during the [[Great Northern War]], Bering resigned in 1724 to avoid the continuing embarrassment of his low rank to Anna, his wife of eleven years</span>
				<span class='text'>Having obtained a promotion on his retirement to the level of first captain, Bering kept this rank when he decided to rejoin the Russian navy later the same year</span>
				<span class='text'>He was selected by Peter to captain the first Kamchatka expedition, an expedition set to sail north from Russian outposts on the [[Kamchatka peninsula]], probably with the greatest emphasis on mapping the new areas visited (and particularly establishing if Asia and America shared a land border)</span>
				<span class='text'>Bering departed St</span>
				<span class='text'>Petersburg in February 1725 at the head of a 34-man expedition, aided by the expertise of lieutenants [[Martin Spangberg]] and [[Aleksei Chirikov]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The party took on men as it headed towards [[Okhotsk]], encountering many difficulties (most notably a lack of food) before they arrived in the settlement</span>
				<span class='text'>From there, they sailed to the Kamchatka peninsula, preparing new ships there and sailing north (repeating a little documented journey of [[Semyon Dezhnyov]] eighty years previously)</span>
				<span class='text'>In August 1728, Bering decided that they had sufficient evidence that there was clear sea between Asia and America, which he did not sight during the trip</span>
				<span class='text'>For the  first expedition, Bering was rewarded with money, prestige, and a promotion to the noble rank of ''captain commander''</span>
				<span class='text'>He immediately started preparations for a second trip</span>
				<span class='text'>aving returned to Okhotsk with a much larger, better prepared, and much more ambitious expedition, Bering set off for an expedition towards [[North America]] in 1741</span>
				<span class='text'>While doing so, the expedition spotted [[Mount Saint Elias]], and sailed past [[Kodiak Island]]</span>
				<span class='text'>A storm separated the ships, but Bering sighted the southern coast of [[Alaska]], and a landing was made at [[Kayak Island]] or in the vicinity</span>
				<span class='text'>Adverse conditions forced Bering to return, and he discovered some of the [[Aleutian Islands]] on his way back</span>
				<span class='text'>One of the sailors died and was buried on one of these islands, and the group was named after him (as the [[Shumagin Islands]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Bering himself became too ill to command his ship, which was at last driven to seek refuge on an uninhabited island in the [[Commander Islands]] group (''Komandorskiye Ostrova'') in the southwest [[Bering Sea]]</span>
				<span class='text'> On 19 December 1741 Vitus Bering died on the island, which was given the name [[Bering Island]] after him, near the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]], reportedly from [[scurvy]] (although this has been contested&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot; name=&quot;1991-expedition not scurvy&quot;&gt;The 1991 Russian-Danish expedition that exhumed Bering's remains also analyzed teeth and bones and concluded that he did not die from scurvy</span>
				<span class='text'>Based on analyses made in Moscow and on Steller's original report, heart failure was the likely cause of death {{harv|Frost|2003}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;), along with 28 men of his company</span>
				<span class='text'>=Biography=====Early life===Vitus Bering was born in the port town of [[Horsens]] in Denmark to Anne Pedderdatter and her husband Jonas Svendsen (a &quot;customs inspector and churchwarden&quot;), being baptised in the [[Lutheran church]] there on 5 August 1681</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;frost19&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Frost|2003|pp=19–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was named after a maternal great-uncle, Vitus Pedersen Bering, who had been a chronicler in the royal court, and was not long deceased at the time of Vitus Jonassen Bering's birth</span>
				<span class='text'>The family enjoyed reasonable financial security, with two of Vitus' elder half-brothers both attending the [[University of Copenhagen]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Vitus, however, did not, and instead signed on at age 15 as a ship's boy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;frost19&quot;/&gt; Between 1696 and 1704, Bering travelled the seas, reaching India and the [[Dutch East Indies]], whilst also finding time to complete naval officer training in Amsterdam</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;frost19&quot;/&gt; He would also claim later (and, it seems, not without some supporting evidence) to have served on Danish whalers in the North Atlantic, visiting European colonies in the Caribbean and on the eastern seaboard of North America</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;frost29&quot;/&gt; It was in Amsterdam, however, that in 1704 and under the guidance of Norwegian-born Russian admiral [[Cornelius Cruys]], Bering enlisted with the Russian navy, taking the rank of sub-lieutenant</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;frost19&quot;/&gt; He would be repeatedly promoted in [[Peter the Great]]'s rapidly evolving navy, reaching the [[History of Russian military ranks#Ranks of the Imperial Russian Navy|rank of second captain]] by 1720</span>
				<span class='text'>In that time, it appears he was not involved in any sea battles, but commanded several vessels in potentially dangerous missions, including the transport of a ship from the [[Azov Sea]] on Russia's southern coast to the Baltic on her northern coast</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;frost19&quot;/&gt; His work in the latter stages of the [[Great Northern War]] (ending in 1721), for example, was dominated by [[lightering]] duties</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;frost26&quot;/&gt;On 8 October 1713, Bering married Anna Christina Pülse; the ceremony took place in the Lutheran church at [[Vyborg]], only recently annexed from Sweden</span>
				<span class='text'>Over the next 18 years, they had 9 children, of which 4 survived childhood</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;frost26&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Frost|2003|pp=26–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time with the Russian navy&amp;nbsp;– particularly as part of the Great Northern War&amp;nbsp;– he was unable to spend much time with Anna, who was approximately eleven years Bering's junior and the daughter of a Swedish merchant</span>
				<span class='text'>At the war's conclusion in 1721, Bering was not promoted like many of his contemporaries</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;frost26&quot;/&gt; The omission proved particularly embarrassing when, in 1724, Anna's younger sister Eufemia upstaged her by marrying Thomas Saunders, already a rear-admiral despite a much shorter period of service</span>
				<span class='text'>In order to save face, the 42-year-old Bering decided to retire from the navy, securing two months' pay and a notional promotion to first captain</span>
				<span class='text'>Shortly after, the family&amp;nbsp;– Bering, his wife Anna, and two young sons&amp;nbsp;– moved out of St</span>
				<span class='text'>Petersburg to live with Anna's family in Vyborg</span>
				<span class='text'>After a period of joblessness lasting five months, however, Bering (keenly aware of his dependents), decided to reapply to the Admiralty</span>
				<span class='text'>He was accepted for a renewed period of active service the same day</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;frost26&quot;/&gt; By 2 October 1724, Bering (retaining the rank of first captain he had secured earlier in the year) was back on the sea, commanding the ninety-gun ''Lesnoe''</span>
				<span class='text'>The Tsar would soon have a new command for him, however</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;frost29&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Frost|2003|pp=29–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;===First Kamchatka expedition==={{main|First Kamchatka Expedition}}====St</span>
				<span class='text'>Petersburg to Okhotsk====On 29 December 1725 &lt;small&gt;&amp;#91;[[Old Style and New Style dates|N</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>] 9 January 1725]&lt;/small&gt;, [[Peter I of Russia]] asked Bering to command a voyage east, probably to map the lands (and possibly seas) between Russia's eastern boundary and the North America continent</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;frost30&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Frost|2003|pp=30–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preparations for the trip had begun some years before, but with his health rapidly deteriorating, the Tsar had ordered that the process be hurried, and it was with this backdrop that Bering (with his knowledge of both the Indian Ocean and the eastern seaboard of North America, good personal skills and experience in transporting goods) was selected ahead of the experienced cartographer K</span>
				<span class='text'>P</span>
				<span class='text'>von Verd</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;frost30&quot;/&gt; His lieutenants for the journey, which would become known as the ''First Kamchatka Expedition'', were the hardened fellow Dane [[Martin Spangberg]] and the well-educated but relatively inexperienced Russian [[Aleksei Chirikov]], a respected naval instructor</span>
				<span class='text'>They would receive annual salaries of some 180 [[rouble]]s during the trip; Bering would be paid 480</span>
				<span class='text'>The final papers from Peter before his death on 28 January made it clear to Bering that he should proceed to the [[Kamchatka peninsula]], build one or two ships there, and, keeping the land on his left, sail northwards until the land turned westwards, making it clear that there existed sea between Asia and North America</span>
				<span class='text'>Instructions were left on how to proceed if North America was sighted during the voyage, which was scheduled to last three years</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;frost30&quot;/&gt; The natural route to Kamchatka was along tributaries of the [[Lena River|Lena]]; but after the [[Treaty of Nerchinsk]] (1689) this looked politically infeasible</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, Bering's party, it was decided, would travel over land and river from St</span>
				<span class='text'>Petersburg to [[Okhotsk]], a small port town on Russia's eastern coast, and then by sea from Okhotsk to the Kamchatka peninsula, where they could start their voyage of exploration</span>
				<span class='text'>On 24 January, Chirikov departed with 26 of the 34-strong expedition along the well-travelled roads to [[Vologda]], {{convert|411|miles|km}} to the east</span>
				<span class='text'>Having waited for the necessary paperwork to be completed, Bering and the remaining members of the expedition followed on 6 February</span>
				<span class='text'>Bering was supplied with what few maps Peter had managed to commission in the preceding years</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;frost30&quot;/&gt;[[File:Vitus Bering</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|left|180px|thumb|A portrait once believed to be of Vitus Bering (according to more recent data, it is likely his uncle's portrait)&lt;ref name=&quot;1991 expedition&quot; group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;In 1991 a Russian-Danish expedition found Bering's burial site</span>
				<span class='text'>Analysis of Bering's skull also showed that Bering could not have had such a round face, as is depicted in most pictures</span>
				<span class='text'>The analysis showed a man of strong stature and a more angular face</span>
				<span class='text'>The portrait most frequently attributed to Bering may possibly be the writer '''Vitus Pedersen Bering''', who was Bering's uncle</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;]]Both parties used horse-drawn sledges and made good time over the first legs of the journey</span>
				<span class='text'>On 14 February they were reunited in Vologda, and, now travelling together, headed eastwards across the [[Ural mountains]], arriving in the small city of [[Tobolsk]] (one of the main stopping points of the journey) on 16 March</span>
				<span class='text'>They had already travelled over 1750 miles</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;frost30&quot;/&gt; At Tobolsk, Bering took on more men to help the party through the more difficult journey ahead</span>
				<span class='text'>He asked for 24 more from the garrison, before upping the request to 54 after hearing that the ship the party required at Okhotsk (the ''Vostok'') would need significant manpower to repair</span>
				<span class='text'>In the end, the governor could spare only 39, but it still represented a significant expansion in numbers for the party</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, Bering wanted 60 carpenters and 7 blacksmiths; the governor responded that half of these would have to be taken on later, at [[Yeniseysk]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After some delays preparing equipment and funds, on 14 May the now much enlarged party left Tobolsk, heading along the [[Irtysh River|Irtysh]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The journey ahead to the next major stopping point [[Yakutsk]], was well-worn, but rarely by groups as large as Bering's, who had the additional difficulty of needing to take on more men as the journey progressed</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, the party ran behind schedule, reaching [[Surgut]] on 30 May and [[Makovsk]] in late June before entering Yeniseysk, where the additional men could be taken on; Bering would later claim that &quot;few were suitable&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>In any case, the party left Yeniseysk on 12 August, desperately needing to make up lost time</span>
				<span class='text'>On 26 September they arrived at [[Ilimsk]], just three days before the river froze over</span>
				<span class='text'>After the party had completed an eighty-mile trek to [[Ust-Kut]], a town on the Lena where they could spend the winter, Bering travelled on to the town of [[Irkutsk]] both to get a sense of the conditions and to seek advice on how best to get their large party across the mountains separating Yakutsk (their next stop) to Okhotsk on the coast</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;frost41&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Frost|2003|pp=41–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;After leaving Ust-Kut when the river ice melted in the spring of 1726, the party rapidly travelled down the River Lena, reaching Yakutsk in the first half of June</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite the need for hurry and men being sent in advance, the governor was slow to grant them the resources they needed, prompting threats from Bering</span>
				<span class='text'>On 7 July, Spangberg left with a detachment of 209 men and much of the cargo; on 27 July apprentice shipbuilder Fyodor Kozlov led a small party to reach Okhotsk ahead of Spangberg, both to prepare food supplies and to start work repairing the ''Vostok'' and building a new ship (the ''Fortuna'') needed to carry the party across the bay from Okhotsk to the Kamchatka peninsula</span>
				<span class='text'>Bering himself left on 16 August, whilst it was decided that Chirikov would follow the next spring with fresh supplies of flour</span>
				<span class='text'>The journeys were as difficult as Bering had worried they would be</span>
				<span class='text'>Both men and horses died, whilst other men (46 from Bering's party alone) deserted with their horses and portions of the supplies as they struggled to build roads across difficult marshland and river terrain</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;frost41&quot;/&gt; If Bering's party (which reached Okhotsk in October) fared badly, however, Spangberg's fared far worse</span>
				<span class='text'>His heavily loaded boats could be tugged at no more than one mile a day&amp;nbsp;– and they had some 685 miles to cover</span>
				<span class='text'>When the rivers froze, the cargo was transferred to sleds and the expedition continued, enduring blizzards and waist-high snow</span>
				<span class='text'>Even provisions left by Bering at [[Yudoma Cross]] could not fend off starvation</span>
				<span class='text'>On 6 January 1727 Spangberg and two other men, who had together formed an advance party carrying the most vital items for the expedition, reached Okhotsk; ten days later sixty others joined them, although many were ill</span>
				<span class='text'>Parties sent by Bering back along the trail from Okhotsk rescued seven men and much of the cargo that had been left behind</span>
				<span class='text'>Okhotsk's inhabitants described the winter as the worst they could recall; Bering seized flour from the local villagers to ensure that his party too could take advantage of their stocks and consequently the whole village soon faced the threat of starvation</span>
				<span class='text'>The explorer later reported how it was only the arrival of an advance party of Chirikov's division in June with 27&amp;nbsp;tons of flour that ensured his party (by then diminished in numbers) could be fed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;frost44&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Frost|2003|pp=44–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;====Okhotsk to Kamchatka and beyond====The ''Vostok'' was readied and the ''Fortuna'' built at a rapid pace, with the first party (48 men commanded by Spangberg and comprising those required to start work on the ships that would have to be built in Kamchatka itself as soon as possible) leaving in June 1727</span>
				<span class='text'>Chirikov himself arrived in Okhotsk soon after, bringing further supplies of food</span>
				<span class='text'>He had had a relatively easy trip, losing none of his men and only 17 of the 140 horses he had set out with</span>
				<span class='text'>On 22 August, the remainder of the party sailed for Kamchatka</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;frost44&quot;/&gt; Had the route been charted, they should have sailed around the peninsula and made port on its eastern coast; instead, they landed on the west and made a gruelling trip from the settlement of Bolsheretsk in the South-West, north to the [[Upper Kamchatka Post]] and then east along the [[Kamchatka River]] to the [[Lower Kamchatka Post]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This Spangberg's party did before the river froze; next, a party led by Bering completed this final stint of approximately 580 miles over land without the benefit of the river; and finally, in the spring of 1728, the last party to leave Bolsheretsk, headed by Chirikov, reached the Lower Kamchatka Post</span>
				<span class='text'>The outpost was six thousand miles from St</span>
				<span class='text'>Petersburg and the journey itself (the first time &quot;so many [had] gone so far&quot;) had taken some three years</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;frost44&quot;/&gt; The lack of immediate food available to Spangberg's advance party slowed their progress, which hastened dramatically after Bering's and Chirikov's group arrived with provisions</span>
				<span class='text'>As a consequence, the ship they constructed (named the ''Archangel Gabriel'') was ready to be launched as soon as 9 June 1728 from its construction point upriver at [[Ushka]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It was then fully rigged and provisioned by 9 July, and on 13 July set sail downstream, anchoring offshore that evening</span>
				<span class='text'>On 14 July, Bering's party began their first exploration, hugging the coast in not a northerly direction (as they had expected) but a north-easterly one</span>
				<span class='text'>The ship's log records a variety of landmarks spotted (including [[St</span>
				<span class='text'>Lawrence Island]]) many of which the expedition took the opportunity to name</span>
				<span class='text'>Translation problems hindered the exploration attempt, however, as Bering was unable to discuss the local geography with locals he encountered</span>
				<span class='text'>Sailing further north, Bering entered for the first time the strait that would later bear his name</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;frost48&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Frost|2003|pp=48–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;Reaching a cape (which Chirikov named [[Cape Chukotsky]]), the land turned westwards, and Bering asked his two lieutenants on 13 August 1728 whether or not they could reasonably claim it was turning westwards for good: that is to say, whether they had proven that Asia and America were separate land masses</span>
				<span class='text'>The rapidly advancing ice prompted Bering to make the controversial decision not to deviate from his remit: the ship would sail for a few more days, but then turn back</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;frost48&quot;/&gt; The expedition was neither at the most easterly point of Asia (as Bering had supposed) nor had it succeed in discovering the Alaskan coast of America, which on a good day would have been visible to the east</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;armstrong161&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;frost48&quot;/&gt; As promised, on 16 August, Bering turned the ''Gabriel'' around, heading back towards Kamchatka</span>
				<span class='text'>Not before a storm forced hasty repairs, the ship was back at the mouth of the Kamchatka River, fifty days after it had left</span>
				<span class='text'>The mission was at its conclusion, but the party still needed to make it back to St</span>
				<span class='text'>Petersburg to document the voyage (thus avoiding the fate of [[Semyon Dezhnyov]] who, unbeknownst to Bering, had made a similar expedition eighty years previously)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;frost56&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Frost|2003|pp=56–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 1729, the ''Fortuna'', which had sailed round the Kamchatka Peninsula to bring supplies to the Lower Kamchatka Post, now returned to Bolsheretsk; and shortly after, so did the ''Gabriel''</span>
				<span class='text'>The delay was caused by a four-day journey Bering had embarked upon directly eastwards in search of North America, to no avail</span>
				<span class='text'>By July 1729 the two vessels were back at Okhotsk, where they were moored alongside the ''Vostok''; the party, no longer needing to carry shipbuilding materials made good time on the return journey from Okhotsk, and by 28 February 1730 Bering was back in the Russian capital</span>
				<span class='text'>In December 1731 he would be awarded 1000 roubles and promoted to captain-commander, his first noble rank (Spangberg and Chirikov were similarly promoted to captain)</span>
				<span class='text'>It had been a long and expensive expedition, costing 15 men and souring relations between Russia and her native peoples: but it had provided useful new (though not perfect) insights into the geography of Eastern Siberia, and presented useful evidence that Asia and North America were separated by sea</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;frost56&quot;/&gt; Bering had not, however, proved the separation beyond doubt</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;armstrong161&quot;/&gt;===Second Kamchatka expedition and death=======Preparations====[[File:1966 CPA 3446</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb | right | 250px| 1966 Soviet postage stamp depicting Bering's second voyage and the discovery of the Commander Islands]]Bering soon proposed a second Kamchatka expedition, much more ambitious than the first and with an explicit aim of sailing east in search of North America</span>
				<span class='text'>The political situation in the Russian Empire was difficult, however, and this meant delays</span>
				<span class='text'>In the interim, the Berings enjoyed their new-found status and wealth: there was a new house and a new social circle for the newly ennobled Berings</span>
				<span class='text'>Bering also made a bequest to the poor of Horsens, had two children with Anna and even attempted to establish his familial coat of arms</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;frost63&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Frost|2003|pp=63–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal, when it was accepted, would a significant affair, which involved 600 people from the outset and several hundred added along the way</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Egerton (2008)&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Egerton|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Bering seems to have been primarily interested in landing in North America, he recognised the importance of secondary objectives: the list of which expanded rapidly under the guidance of planners [[Nikolai Fedorovich Golovin]] (head of the [[Admiralty Board (Russian Empire)|Admiralty]]); [[Ivan Kirilov]], a highly ranked politician with an interest in geography, and [[Andrey Osterman]], a close adviser of the new Empress, [[Anna of Russia|Anna Ivanovna]]</span>
				<span class='text'>As Bering waited for Anna to solidify her grip on the throne, he and Kirilov worked to find a new, more dependable administrator to run Okhotsk and to begin work on improving the roads between Yakutsk and the coastal settlement</span>
				<span class='text'>Their choice for the post of administrator, made remotely, was [[Grigory Skornyakov-Pisarev]]; possibly the least bad candidate, he would nevertheless turn out to be a poor choice</span>
				<span class='text'>In any case, Skornyakov-Pisarev was ordered in 1731 to proceed to Okhotsk, with directions to expand it into a proper port</span>
				<span class='text'>He did not leave for Okhotsk for another four years, by which time Bering's own expedition (in time for which Okhotsk was supposed to have been prepared) was not far off</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;frost63&quot;/&gt;In 1732, however, Bering was still at the planning stage in Moscow, having taken a short leave of absence for St</span>
				<span class='text'>Petersburg</span>
				<span class='text'>The better positioned Kirilov oversaw developments, eyeing up not only the chance of discovering North America, but of mapping the whole Arctic coast, finding a good route south to Japan, landing on the [[Shantar Islands]] and even making contact with Spanish America</span>
				<span class='text'>On 12 June the Senate approved resources to fund an academic contingent for the expedition, and three academics&amp;nbsp;– [[Johann Georg Gmelin]] (a natural historian), [[Louis De l’Isle de la Croyère]] (an astronomer), and [[Gerhard Friedrich Müller]] (an anthropologist)&amp;nbsp;– were selected by the [[Academy of Sciences]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Owen Brazil]], a Moscow native but of Irish descent, was selected as the expedition's quartermaster and was placed in charge of packaging and storing supplies, such as fudge, sausages and biscuits</span>
				<span class='text'>Bering was wary of this expansion in the proposed size of the whole expedition, given the food shortages experienced on the first voyage</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;frost63&quot;/&gt; Proposals were made to transports goods or men to Kamchatka by sea via [[Cape Horn]], but these were not approved</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;frost63&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;debenham421&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Debenham|1941|p=421}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other than a broad oversight role, Bering's personal instructions from the Admiralty were surprisingly simple</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;armstrong161&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;frost63&quot;/&gt; Given on 16 October 1732, they amounted only to recreating his first expedition, but with the added task of heading east and finding North America (a feat which had in fact just been completed by [[Mikhail Gvozdev]],&lt;ref name=&quot;armstrong163&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Armstrong|1982|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this was not known at the time&lt;ref name=&quot;frost63&quot;/&gt;)</span>
				<span class='text'>The suggestion was made that Bering share more of his command with the Chirikov, suggesting that the 51-year-old Bering was slowly being edged out</span>
				<span class='text'>Elsewhere, instructions were sent ahead to Yakutsk, Irkutsk and Okhotsk to aid Bering's second expedition&amp;nbsp;– and thus, the naivety of the first expedition in assuming compliance was repeated</span>
				<span class='text'>Further follies included plans to send ships north along the rivers [[Ob River|Ob]] and [[Lena River|Lena]] towards the Arctic</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;frost63&quot;/&gt;====St</span>
				<span class='text'>Petersburg to Kamchatka====Spangberg left St</span>
				<span class='text'>Petersburg in February 1733 with the first (small) detachment of the second expedition, bound for Okhotsk</span>
				<span class='text'>Chirikov followed on 18 April with the main contingent (initially 500 people and eventually swelling to approximately 3000 after labourers were added)</span>
				<span class='text'>Following them, on 29 April Bering followed with Anna and their two youngest children&amp;nbsp;– their two eldest, both sons, were left with friends in [[Reval]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The academic contingent, including the three professors, left in August</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon catching the main party, Bering and Chirikov led the group eastwards, descending on Tobolsk for the winter</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;frost74&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Frost|2003|pp=74–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arrival of such a large party with such great demands&amp;nbsp;– and so soon after Spangberg had made similar demands&amp;nbsp;– put a strain on the town</span>
				<span class='text'>Bering and a small advance party left Tobolsk in later February, stopping at Irkutsk to pick up gifts for the native tribes they would later encounter; it arrived at Yakustsk in August 1734</span>
				<span class='text'>The main grouping, now under Chirikov's command left Tobolsk in May 1734, but  had a more difficult trek and one which required harsh discipline be imposed to prevent desertions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;frost74&quot;/&gt; Nonetheless, it arrived in Yakutsk in June 1735</span>
				<span class='text'>Whilst Spangberg headed east to Okhotsk, Bering waited in Yakutsk, preparing two ships on the Lena (one would be captained by [[Vasili Pronchishchev]] and the other first by [[Peter Lassenius]] and later by [[Dmitry Laptev]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Both were to sail northwards, and over the coming years to chart the Arctic coastline and to test whether it was navigable</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, Bering soon found he was quickly bogged down in Yakutsk; two parties sent east to find a better route to the [[Okhotsk Sea]] were both failures (the second coming far closer than it realised), and yet this was information the expedition desperately needed</span>
				<span class='text'>Bering decided to prepare a similar land route to the one he had used on the first expedition instead, constructing huts along the route in advance</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;frost74&quot;/&gt; It was work, however, that was still unfinished even by the summer of 1737, such were the delays</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;frost84&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Frost|2003|pp=84–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;At Okhotsk things were little better; it was &quot;ill-suited to be a permanent port&quot;, and Skornyakov-Pisarev was slow to construct the buildings needed</span>
				<span class='text'>Spangberg was, however, able to ready the ships the expedition needed</span>
				<span class='text'>By the end of 1737 the ''Gabriel'' had been refitted; additionally, two new ships, the ''Archangel Michael'' and the ''Nadezhda'', had been constructed and were rapidly readied for a voyage to Japan, a country with which Russia had never had contact</span>
				<span class='text'>The same year, Bering took up residence in Okhotsk</span>
				<span class='text'>It was the fifth year of the expedition, and the original costings now looked naive compared to the true costs of the trip</span>
				<span class='text'>The additional costs (300,000 roubles compared to the 12,000 budgeted) brought poverty to the whole region</span>
				<span class='text'>On 29 June 1738, Spangberg set off for the [[Kuril Islands]] with the three ships he had prepared</span>
				<span class='text'>After he had left there were further delays, probably due to a lack of natural resources</span>
				<span class='text'>Over the next three years, Bering himself was criticised on an increasingly regular basis (his salary had already been halved in 1737 when the originally planned four years ran out); the delays also caused friction between Bering, Chirikov (who felt unduly constrained) and Spangberg (who felt Bering was too weak in his dealings with the local peoples)</span>
				<span class='text'>The two key figures who had been so useful to Bering in St</span>
				<span class='text'>Petersburg back in the early 1730s (Saunders and Kirilov) were now dead, and there were occasional moves to either terminate the expedition or to replace Bering</span>
				<span class='text'>Meanwhile, a fourth ship, the ''Bolsheretsk'' was constructed and Spangberg (having identified some 30 Kuril Islands on his first trip) led the four ships on a second voyage, which saw the first Russians land in Japan</span>
				<span class='text'>In August 1740, with the main, America-bound expedition almost ready, Anna Bering returned to St</span>
				<span class='text'>Petersburg with her and Vitus' younger children</span>
				<span class='text'>Bering would never see his wife again</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;frost84&quot;/&gt; Those without places on a ship also began the long journey home</span>
				<span class='text'>As they left, a messenger arrived; the admiralty was demanding a progress update</span>
				<span class='text'>Bering delayed, promising a partial report from Spangberg and a fuller report later</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb| right | 250px|The grave of Vitus Bering on Bering island]]With time now of the essence, the ''Okhotsk'' (a new construction) left for Bolsheretsk, arriving there in mid-September</span>
				<span class='text'>Another new ship, the ''St</span>
				<span class='text'>Peter'' (''Sviatoi Piotr''), captained by Bering, also left</span>
				<span class='text'>It was accompanied by its sister creation the ''St</span>
				<span class='text'>Paul'' (''Sviatoi Pavel'') and the ''Nadezhda''</span>
				<span class='text'>Delayed by the ''Nadezhda''{{'}} hitting a sand bank&amp;nbsp;– and then being beaten by a storm, such that it was forced to stay at Bolsheretsk&amp;nbsp;– the two other ships arrived in their destination, [[Avacha Bay]] in south-eastern Kamchatka, on 6 October</span>
				<span class='text'>Several buildings had been constructed there on Bering's orders the year before, and now the explorer was able to found the port of [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky]] in the bay</span>
				<span class='text'>Over the winter, Bering recruited for the trip ahead naturalist [[Georg Steller]] and completed the report he had promised to send</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time, however, the murder of several Russians under Bering's command by native tribesmen prompted him to send armed men to the north, with orders not to use force if it could be avoided</span>
				<span class='text'>Apparently it could not, because the detachment killed several native Koryaks in the settlement of [[Utkolotsk]] and enslaved the remainder, bringing them back south</span>
				<span class='text'>Steller was horrified to see the Koryaks tortured in search of the murderers</span>
				<span class='text'>His ethical complaints, like Chirikov's more practical ones before him, were suppressed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;frost112&quot;/&gt; From Petropavlovsk, Bering led his expedition towards [[North America]]</span>
				<span class='text'>he expedition spotted the volcano [[Mount Saint Elias]] on 16 July 1741, where it briefly landed</span>
				<span class='text'>His objective complete, ill and exhausted, Bering turned ship and headed back towards port</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;armstrong161&quot;/&gt; The return journey then included the discovery of [[Kodiak Island]]</span>
				<span class='text'>A storm separated the ships, but Bering sighted the southern coast of [[Alaska]], and a landing was made at [[Kayak Island]] or in the vicinity</span>
				<span class='text'>Under the command of [[Aleksei Chirikov]], the second ship discovered the shores of northwest America ([[Aleksander Archipelago]] of present-day Alaska)</span>
				<span class='text'>Steller ensured the voyage recorded the wildlife it encountered, discovering and describing several species of plant and animal native to the North Pacific and North America during the expedition (including the [[Steller sea cow]] and [[Steller's jay]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Bering himself was forced by adverse conditions to return, and he discovered some of the [[Aleutian Islands]] on his way back</span>
				<span class='text'>One of the sailors died and was buried on one of these islands, and the group was named after him (as the [[Shumagin Islands]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Suffering from [[scurvy]] like many of his crew, Bering steadily became too ill to command the ship, passing control to [[Sven Waxell]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frost|2003|pp=237–245}}&lt;/ref&gt; Storms however meant that the crew of ''Saint Peter'' was soon driven to refuge on an uninhabited island in the [[Commander Islands]] group (''Komandorskiye Ostrova'') in the south-west [[Bering Sea]]</span>
				<span class='text'>On 8 December 1741 Vitus Bering died on the uninhabited island near the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]], which was later given the name [[Bering Island]] in his honour</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;armstrong161&quot;/&gt; Like 28 men of his company, Bering's death was commonly assumed to have been the result of [[scurvy]] (although this has since been contested&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot; name=&quot;1991-expedition not scurvy&quot;/&gt;); certainly, it had afflicted him in the final months</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frost|2003|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The situation was still dire for Bering's expedition (now headed by Waxell), many of them, including Waxell, were still ill and the ''Saint Peter'' was in poor condition</span>
				<span class='text'>By April 1742 the party had ascertained that they were on an island</span>
				<span class='text'>They decided to construct a new vessel from the remnants of the ship in order to return home</span>
				<span class='text'>By August it was ready, successfully reaching Avacha Bay later in the month</span>
				<span class='text'>There, the party discovered that Chirikov had led a rescue mission during 1741 that came within miles of the stranded group</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frost|2003|pp=246–269}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of 77 men aboard ''Sv</span>
				<span class='text'>Piotr'', only 46 survived the hardships of the expedition, which claimed its last victim just one day before coming into home port</span>
				<span class='text'>Its builder, Starodubtsev, returned home with government awards and later built several other seaworthy ships</span>
				<span class='text'>ssessing the scale of Bering's achievements is difficult, given that he was neither the first Russian to sight North America (that having been completed by Gvozdev during the 1730s), nor the first Russian to pass through the strait which now bears his name (an honour which goes to the relatively unknown 17th-century expedition of [[Semyon Dezhnev]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Reports from his second voyage were jealously guarded by the Russian administration, preventing Bering's story from being retold in full for at least a century after his death</span>
				<span class='text'>Nonetheless, Bering's achievements, both as an individual explorer and as a leader of the second expedition are regarded as substantial</span>
				<span class='text'>Consequently, Bering's name has since been used for the [[Bering Strait]] (named by Captain [[James Cook]] despite knowledge of Dezhnev's earlier expedition), the [[Bering Sea]], [[Bering Island]], [[Bering Glacier]] and the [[Bering Land Bridge]]</span>
