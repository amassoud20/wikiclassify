				<span class='text'>Due to slave unrest in the Caribbean, in 1789 he sold part of his plantation in Saint-Domingue and purchased a 284-acre farm called [[Mill Grove]], 20 miles from [[Philadelphia]], to diversify his investments</span>

				<span class='text'>3–4&lt;/ref&gt;From his earliest days, Audubon had an affinity for birds</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, 2004, p</span>

				<span class='text'>He called my attention to their show of pleasure or sense of danger, their perfect forms and splendid attire</span>

				<span class='text'>3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In France during the chaotic years of the [[French Revolution]] and its aftermath, the younger Audubon grew up to be a handsome and gregarious man</span>
				<span class='text'>He played flute and violin, and learned to ride, [[fencing|fence]], and dance</span>

				<span class='text'>5&lt;/ref&gt; A great walker, he loved roaming in the woods, often returning with natural curiosities, including birds' eggs and nests, of which he made crude drawings</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Streshinsky, 1993, p</span>
				<span class='text'>14&lt;/ref&gt; His father planned to make a seaman of his son</span>
				<span class='text'>At twelve, Audubon went to military school and became a cabin boy</span>
				<span class='text'>He quickly found out that he was susceptible to seasickness and not fond of mathematics or navigation</span>
				<span class='text'>After failing the officer's qualification test, Audubon ended his incipient naval career</span>
				<span class='text'>He was cheerfully back on solid ground and exploring the fields again, focusing on birds</span>

				<span class='text'>Jean Audubon and Claude Rozier arranged a business partnership for their sons to pursue in Pennsylvania</span>
				<span class='text'>It was based on Claude Rozier's buying half of Jean Audubon's share of a plantation in Haiti, and lending money to the partnership as secured by half interest in lead mining at Audubon's property of Mill Grove</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rhodes, 2004, p</span>
				<span class='text'>5&quot;/&gt; Studying his surroundings, Audubon quickly learned the ornithologist's rule, which he wrote down as, &quot;The nature of the place—whether high or low, moist or dry, whether sloping north or south, or bearing tall trees or low shrubs—generally gives hint as to its inhabitants</span>

				<span class='text'>He was nursed and recovered at Fatland Ford, with Lucy at his side</span>
				<span class='text'>isking conscription in France, Audubon returned in 1805 to see his father and ask permission to marry</span>
				<span class='text'>He also needed to discuss family business plans</span>

				<span class='text'>39&lt;/ref&gt; Although his return ship was overtaken by an English [[privateer]], Audubon and his hidden gold coins survived the encounter</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, 2004, p</span>
				<span class='text'>32&lt;/ref&gt;Audubon resumed his bird studies and created his own nature museum, perhaps inspired by the great museum of natural history created by [[Charles Willson Peale]] in Philadelphia</span>
				<span class='text'>Peale's bird exhibits were considered scientifically advanced</span>
				<span class='text'>Audubon's room was brimming with birds' eggs, stuffed raccoons and opossums, fish, snakes, and other creatures</span>
				<span class='text'>He had become proficient at specimen preparation and taxidermy</span>
				<span class='text'>eeming the mining venture too risky, with his father's approval Audubon sold part of the Mill Grove farm, including the house and mine</span>

				<span class='text'>He and his small family took over an abandoned log cabin</span>
				<span class='text'>In the fields and forests, Audubon wore typical frontier clothes and moccasins, having &quot;a ball pouch, a buffalo horn filled with gunpowder, a butcher knife, and a tomahawk on his belt</span>

				<span class='text'>I thought he had suddenly foundered, and, speaking to him, was on point of dismounting and leading him, when he all of a sudden fell a-groaning pieteously, hung his head, spread out his forelegs, as if to save himself from falling, and stood stock still, continuing to groan</span>
				<span class='text'>I thought my horse was about to die, and would have sprung from his back had a minute more elapsed; but as that instant all the shrubs and trees began to move from their very roots, the ground rose and fell in successive furrows, like the ruffled water of a lake, and I became bewildered in my ideas, as I too plainly discovered, that all this awful commotion was the result of an earthquake</span>
				<span class='text'>I had never witnessed anything of the kind before, although like every person, I knew earthquakes by description</span>
				<span class='text'>But what is description compared to reality! Who can tell the sensations which I experienced when I found myself rocking, as it were, upon my horse, and with him moving to and fro like a child in a cradle, with the most imminent danger around me</span>

				<span class='text'>He often portrayed them as if caught in motion, especially feeding or hunting</span>
				<span class='text'>This was in stark contrast to the stiff representations of birds by his contemporaries, such as [[Alexander Wilson]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Audubon based his paintings on his extensive field observations</span>

				<span class='text'>163&lt;/ref&gt; He employed multiple layers of watercoloring, and sometimes used [[gouache]]</span>
				<span class='text'>All species were drawn life size which accounts for the contorted poses of the larger birds as Audubon strove to fit them within the page size</span>
				<span class='text'>Smaller species were usually placed on branches with berries, fruit, and flowers</span>
				<span class='text'>He used several birds in a drawing to present all views of anatomy and wings</span>
				<span class='text'>Larger birds were often placed in their ground habitat or perching on stumps</span>
				<span class='text'>At times, as with woodpeckers, he combined several species on one page to offer contrasting features</span>
				<span class='text'>He frequently depicted the birds' nests and eggs, and occasionally natural predators, such as snakes</span>
				<span class='text'>He usually illustrated male and female variations, and sometimes juveniles</span>
				<span class='text'>In later drawings, Audubon used assistants to render the habitat for him</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition to faithful renderings of anatomy, Audubon also employed carefully constructed composition, drama, and slightly exaggerated poses to achieve artistic as well as scientific effects</span>
