				<span class='text'>Millers determination to deal with the eternal themes of life death and human purpose is one of his most prominent themes across his works</span>

				<span class='text'> In  – originally entitled “The Inside of His Head” – Miller brilliantly solves the problem of revealing his main character’s inner discord rendering Willy Loman as solid as the society in which he tries to sell himself</span>
				<span class='text'>Indeed many critics believe that Miller has never surpassed his achievement in this play which stands as his breakthrough work distinguished by an extremely long Broadway run by many revivals and by many theater awards including the Pulitzer Prize in 1949</span>

				<span class='text'>illy Loman desperately wants to believe that he has succeeded that he is “well liked” as a great salesman a fine father and a devoted husband</span>
				<span class='text'>That he has not really attracted the admiration and popularity at which he has aimed is evident however in the weariness that belabors him from the beginning of the play</span>

				<span class='text'>Not only does Joe Keller fail to recognize his social responsibility but also he allows his business partner to take the blame and serve the prison term for the crime</span>
				<span class='text'>Gradually events combine to strip Keller of his rationalizations</span>
