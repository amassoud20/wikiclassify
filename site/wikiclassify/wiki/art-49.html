				<span class='text'>He thought himself a writer of social plays with a strong emphasis on moral problems in American society and often questioned psychological causes of behavior</span>
				<span class='text'>He also built on the realist tradition of Henrik Ibsen in his exploration of the individual’s conflict with society but also borrowed Symbolist and expressionist techniques from Bertolt Brecht and others</span>
				<span class='text'>Some critics attempt to interpret his work from either an exclusively political or an exclusively psychological standpoint but fail to pierce the social veil that Miller creates in his work</span>

				<span class='text'>143&lt;/ref&gt;===Themes=======All American Family====While Miller comes under criticism for his reputation, most critics note him as a dramatist of the family</span>
				<span class='text'>One of his greatest strengths is his penetrating insight into familial relationships</span>

				<span class='text'>From Literature Resource Center&lt;/ref&gt; Often, Miller positions his characters are living in service of their family</span>
				<span class='text'>The conventions of the family play, such as patterns, setting, and style of representation were set canonically by [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[Tennessee Williams]], and Miller</span>
				<span class='text'>In these plays, white men are privileged with their family and social responsibility; typically, these men are lower class</span>
				<span class='text'>Miller maintained that family relationships and families must be immersed in social context</span>

				<span class='text'>77–88&lt;/ref&gt;====Social responsibility====Arthur Miller is known for the consciousness of the characters in his play</span>
				<span class='text'>In his plays, he confronts a level of banality with the roller coaster of guilt and responsibility</span>
				<span class='text'>Some strong examples of characters who portray this struggle between their conscious and their social responsibility are Joe Keller in [[All My Sons]] and John Proctor in [[The Crucible]]</span>

				<span class='text'>34-60&lt;/ref&gt; Miller often creates consequences for characters who ignore or violate their social responsibilities</span>
				<span class='text'>===Life, death, and human purpose====Miller's determination to deal with the eternal themes of life, death and human purpose is one of his most prominent themes across his works</span>
				<span class='text'>This theme spans from Willy Lowman's dedication to providing for his family and his inherent belief that his death would leave a legacy, to John Proctor's willingness to die to preserve his name</span>
				<span class='text'>Mostly all of Miller's protagonists struggle with the mark they leave on life and what it means to die</span>

				<span class='text'>617 pp</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Characters=======Willy Loman====In [[Death of a Salesman]] – originally entitled “The Inside of His Head” – Miller brilliantly solves the problem of revealing his main character’s inner discord, rendering Willy Loman as solid as the society in which he tries to sell himself</span>
				<span class='text'>Indeed, many critics believe that Miller has never surpassed his achievement in this play, which stands as his breakthrough work, distinguished by an extremely long Broadway run, by many revivals, and by many theater awards, including the Pulitzer Prize in 1949</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Rollyson, Carl 2003, p1-12&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Miller, The Pulitzer Prices, pulitzerprize</span>
				<span class='text'>rg&lt;/ref&gt; Death of a Salesman seems destined to remain an American classic and a standard text in American classrooms</span>
				<span class='text'>illy Loman desperately wants to believe that he has succeeded, that he is “well liked” as a great salesman, a fine father, and a devoted husband</span>
				<span class='text'>That he has not really attracted the admiration and popularity at which he has aimed is evident, however, in the weariness that belabors him from the beginning of the play</span>
				<span class='text'>Nearing retirement he suffers a drastic decrease in sales work, a dissatisfying marriage, and a turbulent relationship with his sons which inexorably leads to his suicide with the justification that the insurance will finally provide for his family</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Rollyson, Carl 2003, p1-12&quot;/&gt;====Eddie Carbone====Eddie Carbone is the central character in [[A View From The Bridge]] and is not positioned as the protagonist or the antogonist</span>
				<span class='text'>He is a longshoreman who lives with his wife, Beatrice, and his 17-year-old niece, Catherine</span>
				<span class='text'>When his family from Italy, Rodolpho and Marco, migrate illegally and begin to live with him, the small world that he operates in is disrupted</span>
				<span class='text'>Eddie becomes conflicted and ultimately self-destructive over his sexual attraction to his niece and her involvement with one of his Italian tenants</span>
				<span class='text'>His character arc culminates as he becomes an informer to the immigration authorities which leads to a confrontation with one of his tenants</span>
				<span class='text'>Marco labels him as an informer and Eddie perceives this as a permanent blemish on his good name</span>
				<span class='text'>This confrontation ultimately leads to his death, leaving Eddie as one of Miller's examples of tragic figures</span>

				<span class='text'>He is a faithful farmer who lives by a strict moral code that he violates by succumbing to an affair with a young girl, Abigail, who serves in his home</span>
				<span class='text'>After rejecting her, Abigail spitefully accuses John's wife of witchcraft, involving him in a string of affairs that challenge his beliefs and convictions</span>
				<span class='text'>In his attempts to save his wife, he is convicted of witchcraft as well, and will only be acquitted if he confesses to his crime and signs his name to a piece of paper</span>

				<span class='text'>258–64&lt;/ref&gt;====Joe Keller====Critics have long admired the playwright’s suspenseful handling of the Keller family’s burden in the play [[All My Sons]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The critical character in this work is Joe Keller, who permitted defective parts to remain in warplanes that subsequently crash</span>
				<span class='text'>Not only does Joe Keller fail to recognize his social responsibility, but also he allows his business partner to take the blame and serve the prison term for the crime</span>
				<span class='text'>Gradually, events combine to strip Keller of his rationalizations</span>
				<span class='text'>He argues that he never believed that the cracked engine heads would be installed and that he never admitted his mistake because it would have driven him out of business at the age of sixty-one, when he would not have another chance to “make something” for his family, his highest priority</span>
				<span class='text'>Joe's irresponsibility is exposed through his son's questioning of his very humanity</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Rollyson, Carl 2003, p1-12&quot;/&gt; Joe's suicide results from the tremendous guilt and self-awareness that arises during the play</span>
				<span class='text'>This reversal from staunchly defensive over his honorable need to protect his family to discovering his social responsibility had some critics claiming that this was a theatrical trick</span>
