				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Encyclopædia Britannica Online|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;Huxley's [[1860 Oxford evolution debate|famous debate in 1860]] with [[Samuel Wilberforce]] was a key moment in the wider acceptance of [[evolution]] and in his own career</span>
				<span class='text'>Huxley had been planning to leave [[Oxford]] on the previous day, but, after an encounter with [[Robert Chambers (journalist)|Robert Chambers]], the author of ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation|Vestiges]]'', he changed his mind and decided to join the debate</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilberforce was coached by [[Richard Owen]], against whom Huxley also debated about whether humans were closely related to apes</span>
				<span class='text'>uxley was slow to accept some of Darwin's ideas, such as [[gradualism]], and was undecided about [[natural selection]], but despite this he was wholehearted in his public support of Darwin</span>
				<span class='text'>Instrumental in developing scientific [[education]] in Britain, he fought against the more extreme versions of religious tradition</span>
				<span class='text'>riginally coining the term in 1869, Huxley elaborated on '[[agnosticism]]' in 1889 to frame the nature of claims in terms of what is knowable and what is not</span>
				<span class='text'>Huxley states, &quot;[[Agnosticism]], in fact, is not a creed, but a method, the essence of which lies in the rigorus{{sic}} application of a single principle</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>the fundamental axiom of modern science</span>

				<span class='text'>In matters of the intellect, follow your reason as far as it will take you, without regard to any other consideration</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Biography=====Early life===Thomas Henry Huxley was born in [[Ealing]], then a village in [[Middlesex]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was the second youngest of eight children of George Huxley and Rachel Withers</span>
				<span class='text'>Like some other British scientists of the nineteenth century such as [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], Huxley was brought up in a literate middle-class family which had fallen on hard times</span>
				<span class='text'>His father was a mathematics teacher at Ealing School until it closed,&lt;ref&gt;Bibby, amongst others, queried this account, which owes its origin to Leonard Huxley's biography (1900)</span>

				<span class='text'>3–4&lt;/ref&gt; putting the family into financial difficulties</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, Thomas left school at age 10, after only two years of formal schooling</span>
				<span class='text'>espite this unenviable start, Huxley was determined to educate himself</span>
				<span class='text'>He became one of the great [[autodidacticism|autodidact]]s of the nineteenth century</span>
				<span class='text'>At first he read [[Thomas Carlyle]], [[James Hutton]]'s ''Geology'', and [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|Hamilton]]'s ''Logic''</span>
				<span class='text'>In his teens he taught himself [[German language|German]], eventually becoming fluent and used by [[Charles Darwin]] as a translator of scientific material in German</span>
				<span class='text'>He learned [[Latin language|Latin]],  and enough [[Greek language|Greek]] to read Aristotle in the original</span>
				<span class='text'>[Image:Young Huxley RN</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Huxley, aged 21]]Later on, as a young adult, he made himself an expert, first on [[invertebrates]], and later on [[vertebrates]], all self-taught</span>
				<span class='text'>He was skilled in drawing and did many of the illustrations for his publications on marine invertebrates</span>
				<span class='text'>In his later debates and writing on science and religion his grasp of theology was better than most of his clerical opponents</span>
				<span class='text'>Huxley, a boy who left school at ten, became one of the most knowledgeable men in Britain</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{Harvnb|Huxley|1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;He was apprenticed for short periods to several medical practitioners: at 13 to his brother-in-law John Cooke in Coventry, who passed him on to Thomas Chandler, notable for his experiments using [[animal magnetism|mesmerism]] for medical purposes</span>
				<span class='text'>Chandler's practice was in London's [[Rotherhithe]] amidst the squalor endured by the [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]]ian poor</span>
				<span class='text'>Here Thomas would have seen poverty, crime and rampant disease at its worst</span>

				<span class='text'>105, 421</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Next, another brother-in-law took him on: John Salt, his eldest sister's husband</span>
				<span class='text'>Now 16, Huxley entered Sydenham College (behind [[University College Hospital]]), a cut-price anatomy school whose founder, [[Marshall Hall (physiologist)|Marshall Hall]], discovered the [[reflex arc]]</span>
				<span class='text'>All this time Huxley continued his programme of reading, which more than made up for his lack of formal schooling</span>
				<span class='text'> year later, buoyed by excellent results and a silver medal prize in the [[Society of Apothecaries|Apothecaries']] yearly competition, Huxley was admitted to study at [[Charing Cross Hospital]], where he obtained a small scholarship</span>
				<span class='text'>At Charing Cross, he was taught by [[Thomas Wharton Jones]], Professor of Ophthalmic Medicine and Surgery at [[University College London]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Jones had been [[Robert Knox]]'s assistant when Knox bought cadavers from [[Burke and Hare]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;The cut-price anatomy schools and Robert Knox are well treated in Desmond's account of materialist medical dissidents of the 1820s and 30s: Desmond A</span>

				<span class='text'>Chicago</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The young Wharton Jones, who acted as go-between, was exonerated of crime, but thought it best to leave Scotland</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a fine teacher, up-to-date in physiology and also an ophthalmic surgeon</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1845, under Wharton Jones' guidance, Huxley published his first scientific paper demonstrating the existence of a hitherto unrecognised layer in the inner sheath of hairs, a layer that has been known since as [[Huxley's layer]]</span>
				<span class='text'>No doubt remembering this, and of course knowing his merit, later in life Huxley organised a pension for his old tutor</span>
				<span class='text'>t twenty he passed his First M</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>examination at the [[University of London]], winning the gold medal for [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]]</span>
				<span class='text'>However, he did not present himself for the final (Second M</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> exams and consequently did not qualify with a university degree</span>
				<span class='text'>His apprenticeships and exam results formed a sufficient basis for his application to the Royal Navy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;===Voyage of the ''Rattlesnake''===Aged 20, Huxley was too young to apply to the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]] for a licence to practise, yet he was 'deep in debt'</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1994|}} p</span>
				<span class='text'>35&lt;/ref&gt; So, at a friend's suggestion, he applied for an appointment in the [[Royal Navy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He had references on character and certificates showing the time spent on his apprenticeship and on requirements such as dissection and pharmacy</span>
				<span class='text'>Sir William Burnett, the Physician General of the Navy, interviewed him and arranged for the College of Surgeons to test his competence (by means of a ''[[Oral exam|viva voce]]'')&lt;!-- viva voce links to a disambiguation page, but the best Wikipedia choice might be [[Thesis#Thesis examinations]] which would confuse reader even more (&quot;often an oral examination&quot; - it's always oral); the wiktionary link alternative is worse in it makes the reader think of a dental procedure</span>
				<span class='text'>Leave this ambiguous for now, until a UK-specific explanation arises</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;HMS ''Rattlesnake''&lt;br /&gt;by the ship's artist [[Oswald Brierly]]]]Finally Huxley was made [[surgery|Assistant Surgeon]] ('surgeon's mate') to [[HMS Rattlesnake (1822)|HMS ''Rattlesnake'']], about to start for a voyage of discovery and surveying to New Guinea and Australia</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''Rattlesnake'' left England on 3 December 1846 and, once they had arrived in the southern hemisphere, Huxley devoted his time to the study of marine invertebrates</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huxley|1935}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began to send details of his discoveries back to England, where publication was arranged by [[Edward Forbes]] FRS (who had also been a pupil of Knox)</span>
				<span class='text'>Both before and after the voyage Forbes was something of a mentor to Huxley</span>
				<span class='text'>uxley's paper &quot;On the anatomy and the affinities of the family of Medusae&quot; was published in 1849 by the [[Royal Society]] in its ''Philosophical Transactions''</span>
				<span class='text'>Huxley united the Hydroid and Sertularian polyps with the Medusae to form a class to which he subsequently gave the name of ''[[Hydrozoa]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The connection he made was that all the members of the class consisted of two cell layers, enclosing a central cavity or stomach</span>
				<span class='text'>This is characteristic of the [[phylum]] now called the ''[[Cnidaria]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>He compared this feature to the serous and mucous structures of embryos of higher animals</span>
				<span class='text'>When at last he got a grant from the Royal Society for the printing of plates, Huxley was able to summarise this work in ''The Oceanic Hydrozoa'', published by the [[Ray Society]] in 1859</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Di Gregorio|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huxley|1859}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:Australian woman by Thomas Henry Huxley</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|&lt;center&gt; Australian woman: &lt;br /&gt;Pencil drawing by Huxley]]The value of Huxley's work was recognised and, on returning to England in 1850, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society</span>
				<span class='text'>In the following year, at the age of twenty-six, he not only received the Royal Society Medal but was also elected to the Council</span>
				<span class='text'>He met [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]] and [[John Tyndall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tyndall|1896|Ref=CITEREFTyndall1896|}} pp</span>
				<span class='text'>7, 9, 66, 71</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; who remained his lifelong friends</span>
				<span class='text'>The Admiralty retained him as a nominal assistant-surgeon, so he might work on the specimens he collected and the observations he made during the voyage of the ''Rattlesnake''</span>
				<span class='text'>He solved the problem of ''[[Appendicularia]]'', whose place in the animal kingdom [[Johannes Peter Müller]] had found himself wholly unable to assign</span>
				<span class='text'>It and the [[Ascidiacea|Ascidians]] are both, as Huxley showed, [[tunicates]], today regarded as a sister group to the vertebrates in the phylum ''[[Chordata]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>He wrote up the voyage in the standard Victorian two volume format</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacGillivray|1852}}&lt;/ref&gt;===Later life===Huxley effectively resigned from the navy (by refusing to return to active service) and, in July 1854, he became Professor of Natural History at the [[Royal School of Mines]] and naturalist to the [[British Geological Survey]] in the following year</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, he was Fullerian Professor at the [[Royal Institution]] 1855–58 and 1865–67; Hunterian Professor at the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]] 1863–69; President of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] 1869–1870; President of the [[Royal Society]] 1883–85; Inspector of Fisheries 1881–85; and President of the [[Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom|Marine Biological Association]] 1884–1890</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;The thirty-one years during which Huxley occupied the chair of natural history at the Royal School of Mines included work on vertebrate palaeontology and on many projects to advance the place of science in British life</span>
				<span class='text'>Huxley retired in 1885, after a bout of depressive illness which started in 1884</span>
				<span class='text'>He resigned the Presidency of the Royal Society in mid-term, the Inspectorship of Fisheries, and his chair (as soon as he decently could) and took six month's leave</span>
				<span class='text'>His pension was a fairly handsome £1500 a year</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1890, he moved from London to [[Eastbourne]] where he edited the nine volumes of his ''Collected Essays''</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1894 he heard of [[Eugene Dubois]]' discovery in Java of the remains of ''Pithecanthropus erectus'' (now known as ''[[Homo erectus]]'')</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally, in 1895, he died of a heart attack (after contracting influenza and pneumonia), and was buried in North London at [[East Finchley Cemetery|St Marylebone]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This small family plot had been purchased upon the death of his beloved youngest son Noel, who died of scarlet fever in 1860; Huxley's wife Henrietta Anne née Heathorn and son Noel are also buried there</span>
				<span class='text'>No invitations were sent out, but two hundred people turned up for the ceremony; they included [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Hooker]], [[William Henry Flower|Flower]], [[Mulford B</span>
				<span class='text'>Foster|Foster]], [[Edwin Lankester|Lankester]], [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]] and, apparently, [[Henry James]]</span>

				<span class='text'>thel Huxley (1866–1941) married artist John Collier (widower of sister) in 1889</span>
				<span class='text'>===Public duties and awards====From 1870 onwards, Huxley was to some extent drawn away from scientific research by the claims of public duty</span>
				<span class='text'>He served on eight [[Royal Commission]]s, from 1862 to 1884</span>
				<span class='text'>From 1871 to 1880 he was a Secretary of the [[Royal Society]] and from 1883–85 he was President</span>
				<span class='text'>He was President of the [[Geological Society]] from 1868 to 1870</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1870, he was President of the [[British Association]] at Liverpool and, in the same year was elected a member of the newly constituted [[London School Board]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was President of the [[Quekett Microscopical Club]] from 1877 to 1879</span>
				<span class='text'>He was the leading person amongst those who reformed the Royal Society, persuaded government about science, and established scientific education in British schools and universities</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;{{Harvnb|Bibby|1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before him, science was mostly a gentleman's occupation; after him, science was a profession</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1997|Huxley in perspective}} p</span>
				<span class='text'>235&lt;/ref&gt;He was awarded the highest honours then open to British men of science</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Royal Society]], who had elected him as Fellow when he was 25 (1851), awarded him the [[Royal Medal]] the next year (1852), a year before Charles Darwin got the same award</span>
				<span class='text'>He was the youngest biologist to receive such recognition</span>
				<span class='text'>Then later in life came the [[Copley Medal]] in 1888 and the [[Darwin Medal]] in 1894; the [[Geological Society]] awarded him the [[Wollaston Medal]] in 1876; the [[Linnean Society]] awarded him the [[Linnean Medal]] in 1890</span>
				<span class='text'>There were many other elections and appointments to eminent scientific bodies; these and his many academic awards are listed in the ''Life and Letters''</span>
				<span class='text'>He turned down many other appointments, notably the Linacre chair in zoology at Oxford and the Mastership of [[University College, Oxford]]</span>

				<span class='text'>The loss of [[Francis Maitland Balfour|Francis Balfour]] in 1882, climbing the Alps just after he was appointed to a chair at Cambridge, was a tragedy</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;====Vertebrate palaeontology====The first half of Huxley's career as a palaeontologist is marked by a rather strange predilection for 'persistent types', in which he seemed to argue that evolutionary advancement (in the sense of major new groups of animals and plants) was rare or absent in the [[Phanerozoic]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In the same vein, he tended to push the origin of major groups such as birds and mammals back into the [[Palaeozoic]] era, and to claim that no order of plants had ever gone extinct</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Huxley was wrong to pitch the loss of [[order (biology)|orders]] in the Phanerozoic as low as 7%, and he did not estimate the number of new orders which evolved</span>
				<span class='text'>Persistent types sat rather uncomfortably next to Darwin's more fluid ideas; despite his intelligence, it took Huxley a surprisingly long time to appreciate some of the implications of evolution</span>
				<span class='text'>However, gradually Huxley moved away from this conservative style of thinking as his understanding of palaeontology, and the discipline itself, developed</span>
				<span class='text'>uxley's detailed anatomical work was, as always, first-rate and productive</span>
				<span class='text'>His work on [[fossil fish]] shows his distinctive approach: whereas pre-Darwinian naturalists collected, identified and classified, Huxley worked mainly to reveal the evolutionary relationships between groups</span>

				<span class='text'>Funded by his uncle [[George Peabody]], Marsh had made some remarkable discoveries:the huge [[Cretaceous]] aquatic bird ''[[Hesperornis]]'', and the dinosaur footprints along the [[Connecticut River]] were worth the trip by themselves, but the horse fossils were really special</span>

				<span class='text'>By looking at their teeth he could see that, as the size grew larger and the toes reduced, the teeth changed from those of a browser to those of a grazer</span>
				<span class='text'>All such changes could be explained by a general alteration in habitat from forest to grassland</span>
				<span class='text'>And, we now know, that is what did happen over large areas of North America from the [[Eocene]] to the [[Pleistocene]]: the ultimate causative agent was global temperature reduction (see [[Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum]])</span>
				<span class='text'>The modern account of the [[evolution of the horse]] has many other members, and the overall appearance of the tree of descent is more like a bush than a straight line</span>
				<span class='text'>he horse series also strongly suggested that the process was gradual, and that the origin of the modern horse lay in North America, not in Eurasia</span>
				<span class='text'>If so, then something must have happened to horses in North America, since none were there when Europeans arrived</span>
				<span class='text'>The experience was enough for Huxley to give credence to Darwin's gradualism, and to introduce the story of the horse into his lecture series</span>

				<span class='text'>Huxley had also rejected [[Jean-Baptiste de Monet, Chevalier de Lamarck|Lamarck's]] theory of transmutation, on the basis that there was insufficient evidence to support it</span>
				<span class='text'>All this scepticism was brought together in a lecture to the Royal Institution,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huxley|1855|}} p82–85&lt;/ref&gt; which made Darwin anxious enough to set about an effort to change young Huxley's mind</span>
				<span class='text'>It was the kind of thing Darwin did with his closest scientific friends, but he must have had some particular intuition about Huxley, who was from all accounts a most impressive person even as a young man</span>

				<span class='text'>He never conclusively made up his mind about it, though he did admit it was a hypothesis which was a good working basis</span>
				<span class='text'>ogically speaking, the prior question was whether evolution had taken place at all</span>
				<span class='text'>It is to this question that much of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' was devoted</span>
				<span class='text'>Its publication in 1859 completely convinced Huxley of evolution and it was this and no doubt his admiration of Darwin's way of amassing and using evidence that formed the basis of his support for Darwin in the debates that followed the book's publication</span>
				<span class='text'>uxley's support started with his anonymous favourable review of the ''Origin'' in the ''Times'' for 26 December 1859,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huxley|1893-94a|}} pp</span>

				<span class='text'>===Natural selection====Huxley was certainly not slavish in his dealings with Darwin</span>
				<span class='text'>As shown in every biography, they had quite different and rather complementary characters</span>
				<span class='text'>Important also, Darwin was a field naturalist, but Huxley was an anatomist, so there was a difference in their experience of nature</span>
				<span class='text'>Lastly, Darwin's views on science were different from Huxley's views</span>
				<span class='text'>For Darwin, natural selection was the best way to explain evolution because it explained a huge range of natural history facts and observations: it solved problems</span>
				<span class='text'>Huxley, on the other hand, was an empiricist who trusted what he could see, and some things are not easily seen</span>
				<span class='text'>With this in mind, one can appreciate the debate between them, Darwin writing his letters, Huxley never going quite so far as to say he thought Darwin was right</span>
				<span class='text'>uxley's reservations on natural selection were of the type &quot;until selection and breeding can be seen to give rise to varieties which are infertile with each other, natural selection cannot be proved&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cronin|1991|}} p397&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for this doubt was that comparative anatomy could address the question of descent, ''but not the question of mechanism''</span>

				<span class='text'>tml &quot;Thomas Huxley&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;==The X Club=={{Main|X Club}}In November 1864 Huxley succeeded in launching a dining club, the [[X Club]], like-minded people working to advance the cause of science; not surprisingly, the club consisted of most of his closest friends</span>
				<span class='text'>There were nine members, who decided at their first meeting that there should be no more</span>
				<span class='text'>The members were: Huxley, [[John Tyndall]], [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|J</span>
				<span class='text'>D</span>
				<span class='text'>Hooker]], [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|John Lubbock]] (banker, biologist and neighbour of Darwin), [[Herbert Spencer]] (social philosopher and sub-editor of the Economist), [[William Spottiswoode]] (mathematician and the Queen's Printer), [[Thomas Archer Hirst|Thomas Hirst]] (Professor of Physics at University College London), [[Edward Frankland]] (the new Professor of Chemistry at the Royal Institution) and [[George Busk]], zoologist and palaeontologist (formerly surgeon for [[HMS Dreadnought (1801)|HMS ''Dreadnought'']])</span>
				<span class='text'>All except Spencer were [[Fellows of the Royal Society]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Tyndall was a particularly close friend; for many years they met regularly and discussed issues of the day</span>
				<span class='text'>On more than one occasion Huxley joined Tyndall in the latter's trips into the Alps and helped with his investigations in [[glaciology]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huxley|1857|}} p241&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tyndall|1896|Ref=CITEREFTyndall1896|}} pp</span>

				<span class='text'>241&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tyndall|1857|}} p327–346&lt;/ref&gt;There were also some quite significant X-Club satellites such as [[William Henry Flower|William Flower]] and [[George Rolleston]], (Huxley protegés), and liberal clergyman [[Arthur Penrhyn Stanley|Arthur Stanley]], the Dean of Westminster</span>
				<span class='text'>Guests such as [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] were entertained from time to time</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jensen|1970|}} pp</span>
				<span class='text'>63–72&lt;/ref&gt;They would dine early on first Thursdays at a hotel, planning what to do; high on the agenda was to change the way the Royal Society Council did business</span>
				<span class='text'>It was no coincidence that the Council met later that same evening</span>
				<span class='text'>First item for the Xs was to get the [[Copley Medal]] for Darwin, which they managed after quite a struggle</span>
				<span class='text'>he next step was to acquire a journal to spread their ideas</span>
				<span class='text'>This was the weekly ''Reader'', which they bought, revamped and redirected</span>
				<span class='text'>Huxley had already become part-owner of the ''[[Natural History Review]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1994|}} pp</span>
				<span class='text'>284, 289–290</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; bolstered by the support of Lubbock, Rolleston, Busk and Carpenter (X-clubbers and satellites)</span>
				<span class='text'>The journal was switched to pro-Darwinian lines and relaunched in January 1861</span>
				<span class='text'>After a stream of good articles the ''NHR'' failed after four years; but it had helped at a critical time for the establishment of evolution</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''Reader'' also failed, despite its broader appeal which included art and literature as well as science</span>
				<span class='text'>The periodical market was quite crowded at the time, but most probably the critical factor was Huxley's time; he was simply over-committed, and could not afford to hire full-time editors</span>
				<span class='text'>This occurred often in his life: Huxley took on too many ventures, and was not so astute as Darwin at getting others to do work for him</span>
				<span class='text'>owever, the experience gained with the ''Reader'' was put to good use when the X Club put their weight behind the founding of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 1869</span>
				<span class='text'>This time no mistakes were made: above all there was a permanent editor (though not full-time), [[Joseph Norman Lockyer|Norman Lockyer]], who served until 1919, a year before his death</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1925, to celebrate his centenary, ''Nature'' issued a supplement devoted to Huxley</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barr|1997|}} p1&lt;/ref&gt;The peak of the X Club's influence was from 1873–85 as Hooker, Spottiswoode and Huxley were [[List of Presidents of the Royal Society|Presidents of the Royal Society]] in succession</span>
				<span class='text'>Spencer resigned in 1889 after a dispute with Huxley over state support for science</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1997|}} p191&lt;/ref&gt; After 1892 it was just an excuse for the surviving members to meet</span>
				<span class='text'>Hooker died in 1911, and Lubbock (now [[Baron Avebury|Lord Avebury]]) was the last surviving member</span>
				<span class='text'>uxley was also an active member of the [[Metaphysical Society]], which ran from 1869–80</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Irvine|1955}} Chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt; It was formed around a nucleus of clergy and expanded to include all kinds of opinions</span>
				<span class='text'>Tyndall and Huxley later joined [[The Club (Literary Club)|The Club]] (founded by [[Samuel Johnson|Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Johnson]]) when they could be sure that Owen would not turn up</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1997|}} p123&lt;/ref&gt;==Educational influence==When Huxley himself was young there were virtually no degrees in British universities in the biological sciences and few courses</span>
				<span class='text'>Most biologists of his day were either self-taught, or took medical degrees</span>
				<span class='text'>When he retired there were established chairs in biological disciplines in most universities, and a broad consensus on the curricula to be followed</span>
				<span class='text'>Huxley was the single most influential person in this transformation</span>
				<span class='text'>==School of Mines and Zoology===In the early 1870s the Royal School of Mines moved to new quarters in South Kensington; ultimately it would become one of the constituent parts of Imperial College London</span>
				<span class='text'>The move gave Huxley the chance to give more prominence to laboratory work in biology teaching, an idea suggested by practice in German universities</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; In the main, the method was based on the use of carefully chosen types, and depended on the dissection of anatomy, supplemented by microscopy, museum specimens and some elementary physiology at the hands of Foster</span>
				<span class='text'>he typical day would start with Huxley lecturing at 9am, followed by a program of laboratory work supervised by his demonstrators</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Osborn|1924}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley's demonstrators were picked men—all became leaders of biology in Britain in later life, spreading Huxley's ideas as well as their own</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Michael Foster (physiologist)|Michael Foster]] became Professor of Physiology at Cambridge; [[Ray Lankester|E</span>
				<span class='text'>Ray Lankester]] became Jodrell Professor of Zoology at University College London (1875–91), Professor of Comparative Anatomy at Oxford (1891–98) and Director of the Natural History Museum (1898–1907); S</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Vines became Professor of Botany at Cambridge; [[William Turner Thiselton-Dyer|W</span>

				<span class='text'>William Flower, Conservator to the Hunterian Museum, and THH's assistant in many dissections, became Sir [[William Henry Flower|William Flower]], Hunterian Professor of Comparative Anatomy and, later, Director of the Natural History Museum</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; It's a remarkable list of disciples, especially when contrasted with Owen who, in a longer professional life than Huxley, left no disciples at all</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;No one fact tells so strongly against Owen</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>as that he has never reared one pupil or follower&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Charles Darwin to Asa Gray 1860 in {{Harvnb|Darwin|Seward|1903|}} p153&lt;/ref&gt;Huxley's courses for students were so much narrower than the man himself that many were bewildered by the contrast: &quot;The teaching of zoology by use of selected animal types has come in for much criticism&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lester|1995|}} p67&lt;/ref&gt; Looking back in 1914 to his time as a student, Sir [[Arthur Shipley]] said &quot;[Although] Darwin's later works all dealt with living organisms, yet our obsession was with the dead, with bodies preserved, and cut into the most refined slices&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wollaston|1921|}} p102&lt;/ref&gt; E</span>
				<span class='text'> MacBride said &quot;Huxley</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>would persist in looking at animals as material structures and not as living, active beings; in a word</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>he was a necrologist</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacBride|1934|}} p65&lt;/ref&gt;  To put it simply, Huxley preferred to teach what he had actually seen with his own eyes</span>
				<span class='text'>[Image:Huxley5</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|Photograph of Huxley (c</span>
				<span class='text'>1890)]]This largely [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] program of [[comparative anatomy]] remained at the core of most biological education for a hundred years until the advent of cell and molecular biology and interest in evolutionary ecology forced a fundamental rethink</span>
				<span class='text'>It is an interesting fact that the methods of the field naturalists who led the way in developing the theory of evolution ([[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], [[Alfred Russel Wallace|Wallace]], [[Fritz Müller]], [[Henry Walter Bates|Henry Bates]]) were scarcely represented at all in Huxley's program</span>
				<span class='text'>Ecological investigation of life in its environment was virtually non-existent, and theory, evolutionary or otherwise, was at a discount</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Michael Ruse]] finds no mention of evolution or Darwinism in any of the exams set by Huxley, and confirms the lecture content based on two complete sets of lecture notes</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ruse|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;Since Darwin, Wallace and Bates did not hold teaching posts at any stage of their adult careers (and Műller never returned from Brazil) the imbalance in Huxley's program went uncorrected</span>
				<span class='text'>It is surely strange that Huxley's courses did not contain an account of the evidence collected by those naturalists of life in the tropics; evidence which they had found so convincing, and which caused their views on evolution by natural selection to be so similar</span>
				<span class='text'>Desmond suggests that &quot;[biology] had to be simple, synthetic and assimilable [because] it was to train teachers and had no other heuristic function&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1997|}} p273, note 20&lt;/ref&gt; That must be part of the reason; indeed it does help to explain the stultifying nature of much school biology</span>
				<span class='text'>But zoology as taught at all levels became far too much the product of one man</span>
				<span class='text'>uxley was comfortable with comparative anatomy, at which he was the greatest master of the day</span>
				<span class='text'>He was not an all-round naturalist like Darwin, who had shown clearly enough how to weave together detailed factual information and subtle arguments across the vast web of life</span>
				<span class='text'>Huxley chose, in his teaching (and to some extent in his research) to take a more straightforward course, concentrating on his personal strengths</span>
				<span class='text'>==Schools and the Bible===Huxley was also a major influence in the direction taken by British schools: in November 1870 he was voted onto the [[London School Board]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1997|}} p19–20&lt;/ref&gt; In primary schooling, he advocated a wide range of disciplines, similar to what is taught today: reading, writing, arithmetic, art, science, music, etc</span>
				<span class='text'>In secondary education he recommended two years of basic liberal studies followed by two years of some upper-division work, focusing on a more specific area of study</span>
				<span class='text'>A practical example of the latter is his famous 1868 lecture ''[[On a Piece of Chalk]]'' which was first published as an essay in ''Macmillan's Magazine'' in London later that year</span>

				<span class='text'>uxley supported the reading of the Bible in schools</span>
				<span class='text'>This may seem out of step with his agnostic convictions, but he believed that the Bible's significant moral teachings and superb use of language were relevant to English life</span>

				<span class='text'>Vigorous debate took place on such points, and the debates were minuted in detail</span>
				<span class='text'>Huxley said &quot;I will never be a party to enabling the State to sweep the children of this country into denominational schools&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;School Board Chronicle vol 2, p326&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bibby 1959 p=155&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bibby|1959|}} p155&lt;/ref&gt; The Act of Parliament which founded board schools permitted the reading of the Bible, but did not permit any denominational doctrine to be taught</span>
				<span class='text'>t may be right to see Huxley's life and work as contributing to the secularisation of British society which gradually occurred over the following century</span>
				<span class='text'>Ernst Mayr said &quot;It can hardly be doubted that [biology] has helped to undermine traditional beliefs and value systems&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mayr|1982|}} p80&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;— and Huxley more than anyone else was responsible for this trend in Britain</span>
				<span class='text'>Some modern [[Christian apologists]] consider Huxley the father of [[antitheism]], though he himself maintained that he was an agnostic, not an atheist</span>
				<span class='text'>He was, however, a lifelong and determined opponent of almost all [[organised religion]] throughout his life, especially the &quot;Roman Church</span>

				<span class='text'>60&lt;/ref&gt; In the same line of thought, in an article in ''[[Popular Science]]'', Huxley used the expression &quot;the so-called Christianity of Catholicism,&quot; explaining: &quot;I say 'so-called' not by way of offense, but as a protest against the monstruous assumption that Catholic Christianity is explicitly or implictly contained in any trust-worthy record of the teaching of [[Jesus of Nazareth]]</span>

				<span class='text'>==Adult education===Huxley's interest in education went still further than school and university classrooms; he made a great effort to reach interested adults of all kinds: after all, he himself was largely self-educated</span>
				<span class='text'>There were his lecture courses for working men, many of which were published afterwards, and there was the use he made of journalism, partly to earn money but mostly to reach out to the literate public</span>
				<span class='text'>For most of his adult life he wrote for periodicals—the ''[[Westminster Review]]'', the ''Saturday Review'', the ''Reader'', the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'', ''Macmillan's Magazine'', the ''Contemporary Review''</span>

				<span class='text'>Huxley thought, and said, that the men who attended were as good as any country squire</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1994}} Chapter 19&lt;/ref&gt;The technique of printing his more popular lectures in periodicals which were sold to the general public was extremely effective</span>
				<span class='text'>A good example was ''The physical basis of life'', a lecture given in Edinburgh on 8 November 1868</span>
				<span class='text'>Its theme&amp;nbsp;— that vital action is nothing more than &quot;the result of the molecular forces of the [[protoplasm]] which displays it&quot;&amp;nbsp;— shocked the audience, though that was nothing compared to the uproar when it was published in the ''[[Fortnightly Review]]'' for February 1869</span>
				<span class='text'>John Morley, the editor, said &quot;No article that had appeared in any periodical for a generation had caused such a sensation&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morley|1917}} p90&lt;/ref&gt; The issue was reprinted seven times and [[protoplasm]] became a household word; ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' added 'Professor Protoplasm' to his other soubriquets</span>
				<span class='text'>he topic had been stimulated by Huxley seeing the [[cytoplasmic streaming]] in plant cells, which is indeed a sensational sight</span>
				<span class='text'>For these audiences Huxley's claim that this activity should not be explained by words such as vitality, but by the working of its constituent chemicals, was surprising and shocking</span>
				<span class='text'>Today we would perhaps emphasise the extraordinary structural arrangement of those chemicals as the key to understanding what cells do, but little of that was known in the nineteenth century</span>
				<span class='text'>hen the Archbishop of York thought this 'new philosophy' was based on [[Auguste Comte]]'s [[positivism]], Huxley corrected him: &quot;Comte's philosophy [is just] Catholicism minus Christianity&quot; (Huxley 1893 vol 1 of Collected Essays ''Methods &amp; Results'' 156)</span>
				<span class='text'>A later version was &quot;[positivism is] sheer Popery with M</span>

				<span class='text'>In {{Harvnb|Barr|1997|}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a start, Huxley dismisses religion as a source of [[moral authority]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Next, he believes the mental characteristics of man are as much a product of evolution as the physical aspects</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, our emotions, our intellect, our tendency to prefer living in groups and spend resources on raising our young are part and parcel of our evolution, and therefore [[Heredity|inherit]]ed</span>
				<span class='text'>espite this, the ''details'' of our values and ethics are not inherited: they are partly determined by our culture, and partly chosen by ourselves</span>
				<span class='text'>Morality and duty are often at war with natural instincts; ethics cannot be derived from the ''struggle for existence''</span>
				<span class='text'>It is therefore our responsibility to make ethical choices (see [[Ethics]] and [[Evolutionary ethics]])</span>
				<span class='text'>This seems to put Huxley as a [[Free will#Compatibilism|compatibilist]] in the [[Free will|Free Will]] vs [[Determinism]] debate</span>
				<span class='text'>In this argument Huxley is diametrically opposed to his old friend [[Herbert Spencer]]</span>
