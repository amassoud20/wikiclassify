				<span class='text'>tm&lt;/ref&gt; Plato's influence on [[Christian thought]] is often thought to be mediated by his major influence on [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine of Hippo]], one of the most important [[Christian philosophy|philosophers]] and [[theologians]] in the [[history of Christianity]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lato was the innovator of the [[dialogue]] and [[dialectic]] forms in philosophy, which originate with him</span>
				<span class='text'>Plato appears to have been the founder of Western [[political philosophy]], with his [[Plato's Republic|''Republic'']], and [[Plato's Laws|''Laws'']] among other dialogues, providing some of the earliest extant treatments of political questions from a philosophical perspective</span>
				<span class='text'>Plato's own most decisive philosophical influences are usually thought to have been Socrates, [[Parmenides]], [[Heraclitus]] and [[Pythagoras]], although few of his predecessors' works remain extant and much of what we know about these figures today derives from Plato himself</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;quote=&quot;Though influenced primarily by Socrates, to the extent that Socrates is usually the main character in many of Plato's writings, he was also influenced by Heraclitus, Parmenides, and the Pythagoreans&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>du/plato/&lt;/ref&gt;The ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' describes Plato as &quot;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>ne of the most dazzling writers in the Western literary tradition and one of the most penetrating, wide-ranging, and influential authors in the [[history of philosophy]]</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>He was not the first thinker or writer to whom the word “philosopher” should be applied</span>
				<span class='text'>But he was so self-conscious about how philosophy should be conceived, and what its scope and ambitions properly are, and he so transformed the intellectual currents with which he grappled, that the subject of philosophy, as it is often conceived—a rigorous and systematic examination of [[ethical]], [[political]], [[metaphysical]], and [[epistemological]] issues, armed with a distinctive method—can be called his invention</span>
				<span class='text'>Few other authors in the history of Western philosophy approximate him in depth and range: perhaps only Aristotle (who studied with him), [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] would be generally agreed to be of the same rank</span>

				<span class='text'>The philosopher came from one of the wealthiest and most politically active families in&amp;nbsp;Athens</span>
				<span class='text'>Ancient sources describe him as a bright though modest boy who excelled in his studies</span>
				<span class='text'>His father contributed all which was necessary to give to his son a good education, and, therefore, Plato must have been instructed in grammar, music, gymnastics and philosophy by some of the most distinguished teachers of his era</span>
				<span class='text'>===Birth and family====The exact time and place of Plato's birth are unknown, but it is certain that he belonged to an aristocratic and influential family</span>
				<span class='text'>Based on ancient sources, most modern scholars believe that he was born in Athens or [[Aegina]]{{Ref label|C|c|none}} between 429 and 423 BCE</span>
				<span class='text'>{Ref label|A|a|none}} His father was [[Ariston (Athenian)|Ariston]]</span>
				<span class='text'>According to a disputed tradition, reported by [[Diogenes Laertius]], Ariston traced his descent from the [[king of Athens]], [[Codrus]], and the king of [[Messenia]], [[Melanthus]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;LaI&quot;&gt;Diogenes Laertius, ''Life of Plato'', I&lt;/ref&gt; Perictione was sister of [[Charmides]] and niece of [[Critias]], both prominent figures of the [[Thirty Tyrants]], the brief [[oligarchy|oligarchic]] [[regime]], which followed on the collapse of Athens at the end of the [[Peloponnesian War]] (404–403 BCE)</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Some have held that                            Glaucon and Adeimantus were uncles of Plato, but Zeller decides for the                            usual view that they were brothers</span>

				<span class='text'> 1]&lt;/ref&gt;The traditional date of Plato's birth (428/427) is based on a dubious interpretation of Diogenes Laertius, who says, &quot;When [Socrates] was gone, [Plato] joined Cratylus the Heracleitean and Hermogenes, who philosophized in the manner of Parmenides</span>
				<span class='text'>Then, at twenty-eight, Hermodorus says, [Plato] went to Euclides in Megara</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; As Debra Nails argues, &quot;The text itself gives no reason to infer that Plato left immediately for Megara and implies the very opposite</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Nails|2002|p=247}} In his ''[[Seventh Letter (Plato)|Seventh Letter]]'', Plato notes that his coming of age coincided with the taking of power by the Thirty, remarking, &quot;But a youth under the age of twenty made himself a laughingstock if he attempted to enter the political arena</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Thus, Nails dates Plato's birth to 424/423</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Nails|2002|p=246}}According to some accounts, Ariston tried to force his attentions on Perictione, but failed in his purpose; then the [[Twelve Olympians|god]] [[Apollo]] appeared to him in a vision, and as a result, Ariston left Perictione unmolested</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''[[De Divinatione]]'', I, 36&lt;/ref&gt;Ariston appears to have died in Plato's childhood, although the precise dating of his death is difficult</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Guthrie|1986|p=11}} These and other references suggest a considerable amount of family pride and enable us to reconstruct Plato's [[family tree]]</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Kahn|2004|p=186}}====Name====According to [[Diogenes Laërtius]], the philosopher was named ''Aristocles'' (Ἀριστοκλῆς) after his grandfather</span>
				<span class='text'>It was common in Athenian society for boys to be named after grandfathers (or fathers)</span>
				<span class='text'>But there is only one inscriptional record of an Aristocles, an early Archon of Athens in 605/4 BCE</span>
				<span class='text'>There is no record of a line from Aristocles to Plato's father, Ariston</span>
				<span class='text'>However, if Plato was not named after an ancestor named Plato (there is no record of one), then the origin of his renaming as ''Plato'' becomes a conundrum</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The sources of Diogenes account for this fact by claiming that his [[wrestling]] coach, Ariston of Argos, dubbed him ''Platon'', meaning &quot;broad,&quot; on account of his robust figure&lt;ref name=&quot;LaIV&quot;&gt;Diogenes Laertius, ''Life of Plato'', IV&lt;/ref&gt; or that Plato derived his name from the breadth (πλατύτης, ''platytēs'') of his eloquence, or else because he was very wide (πλατύς, ''platýs'') across the forehead</span>

				<span class='text'>Another scholar, however, claims that &quot;there is good reason for not dismissing [the idea that Aristocles was Plato's given name] as a mere invention of his biographers&quot;, noting how prevalent that account is in our sources</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|Plato and [[Socrates]] in a medieval depiction]]The precise relationship between Plato and Socrates remains an area of contention among scholars</span>
				<span class='text'>Plato makes it clear in his [[Apology (Plato)|''Apology of Socrates'']], that he was a devoted young follower of Socrates</span>
				<span class='text'>In that dialogue, Socrates is presented as mentioning Plato by name as one of those youths close enough to him to have been corrupted, if he were in fact guilty of corrupting the youth, and questioning why their fathers and brothers did not step forward to testify against him if he was indeed guilty of such a crime (33d-34a)</span>
				<span class='text'>Later, Plato is mentioned along with Crito, Critobolus, and Apollodorus as offering to pay a fine of 30 minas on Socrates' behalf, in lieu of the death penalty proposed by Meletus (38b)</span>
				<span class='text'>In the ''[[Phaedo]]'', the title character lists those who were in attendance at the prison on Socrates' last day, explaining Plato's absence by saying, &quot;Plato was ill</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; (''Phaedo'' 59b)Plato never speaks in his own voice in his dialogues</span>
				<span class='text'>In the [[Second Letter (Plato)|''Second Letter'']], it says, &quot;no writing of Plato exists or ever will exist, but those now said to be his are those of a Socrates become beautiful and new&quot; (341c); if the Letter is Plato's, the final qualification seems to call into question the dialogues' historical fidelity</span>
				<span class='text'>In any case, [[Xenophon]] and [[Aristophanes]] seem to present a somewhat different portrait of Socrates from the one Plato paints</span>
				<span class='text'>Some have called attention to the problem of taking Plato's Socrates to be his mouthpiece, given Socrates' reputation for irony and the dramatic nature of the dialogue form</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Strauss|1964|pp=50–51}}Aristotle attributes a different doctrine with respect to the [[Theory of forms|Ideas]] to Plato and Socrates (''Metaphysics'' 987b1–11)</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Dillon|2003|pp=1–3}}{{sfn|Press|2000|p=1}}Throughout his later life, Plato became entangled with the politics of the city of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]]</span>

				<span class='text'>After Dionysius's death, according to [[Seventh Letter (Plato)|Plato's ''Seventh Letter'']], Dion requested Plato return to Syracuse to tutor [[Dionysius II of Syracuse|Dionysius II]] and guide him to become a philosopher king</span>
				<span class='text'>Dionysius II seemed to accept Plato's teachings, but he became suspicious of Dion, his uncle</span>
				<span class='text'>Dionysius expelled Dion and kept Plato against his will</span>
				<span class='text'>Eventually Plato left Syracuse</span>
				<span class='text'>Dion would return to overthrow Dionysius and ruled Syracuse for a short time before being usurped by [[Calippus of Syracuse|Calippus]], a fellow disciple of Plato</span>

				<span class='text'>Plato holds his ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' and gestures to the heavens, representing his belief in [[The Forms]]]]===Recurrent themes===Plato often discusses the father-son relationship and the question of whether a father's interest in his sons has much to do with how well his sons turn out</span>
				<span class='text'>In ancient Athens, a boy was socially located by his family identity, and Plato often refers to his characters in terms of their paternal and fraternal relationships</span>
				<span class='text'>Socrates was not a family man, and saw himself as the son of his mother, who was apparently a midwife</span>
				<span class='text'>A divine fatalist, Socrates mocks men who spent exorbitant fees on tutors and trainers for their sons, and repeatedly ventures the idea that good character is a gift from the gods</span>
				<span class='text'>Crito reminds Socrates that orphans are at the mercy of chance, but Socrates is unconcerned</span>
				<span class='text'>In the ''Theaetetus'', he is found recruiting as a disciple a young man whose inheritance has been squandered</span>
				<span class='text'>Socrates twice compares the relationship of the older man and his boy lover to the father-son relationship (''Lysis'' 213a, ''Republic'' 3</span>
				<span class='text'>03b), and in the ''Phaedo'', Socrates' disciples, towards whom he displays more concern than his biological sons, say they will feel &quot;fatherless&quot; when he is gone</span>
				<span class='text'>n several of Plato's dialogues, Socrates promulgates the idea that [[knowledge]] is a matter of recollection, and not of learning, observation, or study</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Baird &amp; Kaufmann|2008}} He maintains this view somewhat at his own expense, because in many dialogues, Socrates complains of his forgetfulness</span>
				<span class='text'>Socrates is often found arguing that knowledge is not empirical, and that it comes from divine insight</span>
				<span class='text'>In many middle period dialogues, such as the ''Phaedo'', ''Republic'' and ''Phaedrus'' Plato advocates a belief in the immortality of the soul, and several dialogues end with long speeches imagining the [[afterlife]]</span>
				<span class='text'>More than one dialogue contrasts knowledge and opinion, perception and [[reality]], [[nature]] and custom, and body and soul</span>
				<span class='text'>everal dialogues tackle questions about art: Socrates says that poetry is inspired by the [[muses]], and is not rational</span>
				<span class='text'>He speaks approvingly of this, and other forms of divine madness (drunkenness, eroticism, and dreaming) in the ''[[Phaedrus (Plato)|Phaedrus]] ''(265a–c), and yet in the ''[[Republic (Plato)|''Republic'']]'' wants to outlaw Homer's great poetry, and laughter as well</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''[[Ion (dialogue)|Ion]]'', Socrates gives no hint of the disapproval of Homer that he expresses in the ''Republic''</span>
				<span class='text'>The dialogue ''Ion'' suggests that [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' functioned in the ancient Greek world as the Bible does today in the modern Christian world: as divinely inspired literature that can provide moral guidance, if only it can be properly interpreted</span>
				<span class='text'>ocrates and his company of disputants had something to say on many subjects, including politics and art, religion and science, justice and medicine, virtue and vice, crime and punishment, pleasure and pain, rhetoric and rhapsody, human nature and sexuality, as well as love and wisdom</span>
				<span class='text'>==Metaphysics==={{Main|Platonic realism}}&lt;!-- Socrates is a character in Plato's dialogues! --&gt;&quot;Platonism&quot; is a term coined by scholars to refer to the intellectual consequences of denying, as Plato's Socrates often does, the reality of the material world</span>
				<span class='text'>In several dialogues, most notably the ''Republic'', Socrates inverts the common man's intuition about what is knowable and what is real</span>
				<span class='text'>While most people take the objects of their senses to be real if anything is, Socrates is contemptuous of people who think that something has to be graspable in the hands to be real</span>
				<span class='text'>In the ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'', he says such people are ''eu amousoi'' (εὖ ἄμουσοι), an expression that means literally, &quot;happily without the muses&quot; (''Theaetetus'' 156a)</span>
				<span class='text'>In other words, such people live without the divine inspiration that gives him, and people like him, access to higher insights about reality</span>
				<span class='text'>ocrates's idea that reality is unavailable to those who use their senses is what puts him at odds with the common man, and with common sense</span>
				<span class='text'>Socrates says that he who sees with his eyes is blind, and this idea is most famously captured in his [[allegory of the cave]], and more explicitly in his description of [[the divided line of Plato|the divided line]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The allegory of the cave (begins ''Republic'' 7</span>
				<span class='text'>14a) is a paradoxical analogy wherein Socrates argues that the invisible world is the most intelligible (&quot;noeton&quot;) and that the visible world (&quot;(h)oraton&quot;) is the least knowable, and the most obscure</span>
				<span class='text'>ocrates says in the ''Republic'' that people who take the sun-lit world of the senses to be good and real are living pitifully in a den of evil and ignorance</span>
				<span class='text'>Socrates admits that few climb out of the den, or cave of ignorance, and those who do, not only have a terrible struggle to attain the heights, but when they go back down for a visit or to help other people up, they find themselves objects of scorn and ridicule</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to Socrates, physical objects and physical events are &quot;shadows&quot; of their ideal or perfect forms, and exist only to the extent that they instantiate the perfect versions of themselves</span>
				<span class='text'>Just as shadows are temporary, inconsequential epiphenomena produced by physical objects, physical objects are themselves fleeting phenomena caused by more substantial causes, the ideals of which they are mere instances</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, Socrates thinks that perfect justice exists (although it is not clear where) and his own trial would be a cheap copy of it</span>
				<span class='text'>he allegory of the cave (often said by scholars to represent Plato's own epistemology and metaphysics) is intimately connected to his political ideology (often said to also be Plato's own), that only people who have climbed out of the cave and cast their eyes on a vision of goodness are fit to rule</span>
				<span class='text'>Socrates claims that the enlightened men of society must be forced from their divine contemplations and be compelled to run the city according to their lofty insights</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus is born the idea of the &quot;[[philosopher king|philosopher-king]]&quot;, the wise person who accepts the power thrust upon him by the people who are wise enough to choose a good master</span>
				<span class='text'>This is the main thesis of Socrates in the ''Republic'', that the most wisdom the masses can muster is the wise choice of a ruler</span>
				<span class='text'>==Theory of Forms==={{Main|Theory of Forms}}The theory of Forms (or theory of Ideas) typically refers to the belief that the material world as it seems to us is not the real world, but only an &quot;image&quot; or &quot;copy&quot; of the real world</span>
				<span class='text'>In some of Plato's dialogues, this is expressed by Socrates, who spoke of forms in formulating [[Platonic realism|a solution]] to the [[problem of universals]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The forms, according to Socrates, are [[archetype]]s or [[Abstraction|abstract]] representations of the many [[Type (metaphysics)|types]] of things, and [[property (metaphysics)|properties]] we feel and see around us, that can only be perceived by reason ({{lang-el|λογική}})</span>
				<span class='text'>(That is, they are [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]]</span>
				<span class='text'> In other words, Socrates was able to recognize two worlds: the apparent world, which constantly changes, and an unchanging and unseen world of forms, which may be the cause of what is apparent</span>
				<span class='text'>==Epistemology==={{Main| Platonic epistemology}}Many have interpreted Plato as stating—even having been the first to write—that [[knowledge]] is [[justified true belief]], an influential view that informed future developments in epistemology</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Fine|2003|p=5}} This interpretation is partly based on a reading of the ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'' wherein Plato argues that knowledge is distinguished from mere true belief by the knower having an &quot;account&quot; of the object of her or his true belief ({{citeplato|Theaetetus|201c–d}})</span>
				<span class='text'>And this theory may again be seen in the ''Meno'', where it is suggested that true belief can be raised to the level of knowledge if it is bound with an account as to the question of &quot;why&quot; the object of the true belief is so ({{citeplato|Meno|97d–98a}})</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|McDowell|1973|p=230}} Many years later, [[Edmund Gettier]] famously demonstrated the problems of the justified true belief account of knowledge</span>
				<span class='text'>That the modern theory of justified true belief as knowledge which Gettier addresses is equivalent to Plato's is accepted by some scholars but rejected by others</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Fine|1979|p=366}} Plato himself also identified problems with the ''justified true belief'' definition in the ''Theaetetus'', concluding that justification (or an &quot;account&quot;) would require knowledge of ''differentness'', meaning that the definition of knowledge is [[circular reasoning|circular]] ({{citeplato|Theaetetus|210a–b}})</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|McDowell|1973|p=256}}Later in the ''[[Meno (Plato)#Dialogue with Meno's slave|Meno]]'', Socrates uses a geometrical example to expound Plato's view that knowledge in this latter sense is acquired by [[Anamnesis (philosophy)|recollection]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Socrates elicits a fact concerning a geometrical construction from a slave boy, who could not have otherwise known the fact (due to the slave boy's lack of education)</span>
				<span class='text'>The knowledge must be present, Socrates concludes, in an eternal, non-experiential form</span>
				<span class='text'>n other dialogues, the ''[[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]]'', ''[[Statesman (dialogue)|Statesman]]'', ''[[Republic (dialogue)|Republic]]'', and the ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]'', Plato himself associates knowledge with the apprehension of unchanging Forms and their relationships to one another (which he calls &quot;expertise&quot; in [[Dialectic]]), including through the processes of ''collection'' and ''division''</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Taylor|2011|pp=176–187}} More explicitly, Plato himself argues in the ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' that knowledge is always proportionate to the realm from which it is gained</span>
				<span class='text'>In other words, if one derives one's account of something experientially, because the world of sense is in flux, the views therein attained will be mere opinions</span>
				<span class='text'>And opinions are characterized by a lack of necessity and stability</span>
				<span class='text'>On the other hand, if one derives one's account of something by way of the non-sensible forms, because these forms are unchanging, so too is the account derived from them</span>
				<span class='text'>That apprehension of forms is required for knowledge may be taken to cohere with Plato's theory in the ''Theaetetus'' and ''Meno''</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lee|2011|p=432}} Indeed, the apprehension of Forms may be at the base of the &quot;account&quot; required for justification, in that it offers [[Foundationalism|foundational]] knowledge which itself needs no account, thereby avoiding an [[infinite regression]]</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|''Papirus Oxyrhynchus'', with fragment of Plato's ''Republic'']]Plato's philosophical views had many societal implications, especially on the idea of an ideal [[State (polity)|state]] or government</span>
				<span class='text'>There is some discrepancy between his early and later views</span>
				<span class='text'>Some of the most famous doctrines are contained in the ''Republic'' during his middle period, as well as in the ''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]'' and the ''Statesman''</span>
				<span class='text'>However, because Plato wrote dialogues, it is assumed that Socrates is often speaking for Plato</span>
				<span class='text'>This assumption may not be true in all cases</span>
				<span class='text'>lato, through the words of Socrates, asserts that societies have a tripartite class structure corresponding to the appetite/spirit/reason structure of the individual soul</span>
				<span class='text'>The appetite/spirit/reason are analogous to the castes of society</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Blössner|2007|pp=345–349}}* ''Productive'' (Workers) — the labourers, carpenters, plumbers, masons, merchants, farmers, ranchers, etc</span>
				<span class='text'>These correspond to the &quot;appetite&quot; part of the soul</span>
				<span class='text'> ''Protective'' (Warriors or Guardians) — those who are adventurous, strong and brave; in the armed forces</span>
				<span class='text'>These correspond to the &quot;spirit&quot; part of the soul</span>
				<span class='text'> ''Governing'' (Rulers or Philosopher Kings) — those who are intelligent, rational, self-controlled, in love with wisdom, well suited to make decisions for the community</span>
				<span class='text'>These correspond to the &quot;reason&quot; part of the soul and are very few</span>
				<span class='text'>n the [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]], Plato locates the parts of the soul within the human body: Reason is located in the head, spirit in the top third of the [[torso]], and the appetite in the middle third of the torso, down to the [[navel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Plato, {{citeplato|Timaeus|44d}} &amp; {{citeplaton|Timaeus|70}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Dorter|2006|p=360}}According to this model, the principles of [[Athenian democracy]] (as it existed in his day) are rejected as only a few are fit to rule</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead of rhetoric and persuasion, Plato says reason and wisdom should govern</span>
				<span class='text'>As Plato puts it:: &quot;Until philosophers rule as kings or those who are now called kings and leading men genuinely and adequately philosophise, that is, until political power and philosophy entirely coincide, while the many natures who at present pursue either one exclusively are forcibly prevented from doing so, cities will have no rest from evils,</span>

				<span class='text'>nor, I think, will the human race</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; (''Republic'' 473c-d)[[File:Plato i sin akademi, av Carl Johan Wahlbom (ur Svenska Familj-Journalen)</span>
				<span class='text'>ng|thumb|Plato in his academy, drawing after a painting by Swedish painter Carl Johan Wahlbom]]Plato describes these &quot;philosopher kings&quot; as &quot;those who love the sight of truth&quot; (''Republic'' 475c) and supports the idea with the analogy of a captain and his ship or a doctor and his medicine</span>
				<span class='text'>According to him, sailing and health are not things that everyone is qualified to practice by nature</span>
				<span class='text'>A large part of the ''Republic'' then addresses how the educational system should be set up to produce these philosopher kings</span>
				<span class='text'>owever, it must be taken into account that the ideal city outlined in the ''Republic'' is qualified by Socrates as the ideal ''luxurious'' city, examined to determine how it is that injustice and justice grow in a city (''Republic'' 372e)</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Socrates, the &quot;true&quot; and &quot;healthy&quot; city is instead the one first outlined in book II of the ''Republic'', 369c–372d, containing farmers, craftsmen, merchants, and wage-earners, but lacking the guardian class of philosopher-kings as well as delicacies such as &quot;perfumed oils, incense, prostitutes, and pastries&quot;, in addition to paintings, gold, ivory, couches, a multitude of occupations such as poets and hunters, and war</span>
				<span class='text'>n addition, the ideal city is used as an image to illuminate the state of one's soul, or the [[Free will|will]], [[reason]], and [[Interpersonal attraction|desire]]s combined in the human body</span>
				<span class='text'>Socrates is attempting to make an image of a rightly ordered human, and then later goes on to describe the different kinds of humans that can be observed, from tyrants to lovers of money in various kinds of cities</span>
				<span class='text'>The ideal city is not promoted, but only used to magnify the different kinds of individual humans and the state of their soul</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the [[philosopher king]] image was used by many after Plato to justify their personal political beliefs</span>
				<span class='text'>The philosophic soul according to Socrates has reason, will, and desires united in virtuous harmony</span>
				<span class='text'>A philosopher has the [[moderate]] love for [[wisdom]] and the [[courage]] to act according to wisdom</span>
				<span class='text'>Wisdom is [[knowledge]] about the [[Goodness and value theory|Good]] or the right relations between all that [[Existence|exist]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>herein it concerns states and rulers, Plato has made interesting arguments</span>
				<span class='text'>For instance he asks which is better—a bad democracy or a country reigned by a tyrant</span>
				<span class='text'>He argues that it is better to be ruled by a bad tyrant, than be a bad democracy (since here all the people are now responsible for such actions, rather than one individual committing many bad deeds</span>
				<span class='text'> This is emphasised within the ''Republic'' as Plato describes the event of mutiny on board a ship</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Plato, {{citeplato|Republic|488}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plato suggests the ship's crew to be in line with the democratic rule of many and the captain, although inhibited through ailments, the tyrant</span>
				<span class='text'>Plato's description of this event is parallel to that of democracy within the state and the inherent problems that arise</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to Plato, a state made up of different kinds of souls will, overall, decline from an [[aristocracy]] (rule by the best) to a [[timocracy]] (rule by the honorable), then to an [[oligarchy]] (rule by the few), then to a [[democracy]] (rule by the people), and finally to [[tyranny]] (rule by one person, rule by a tyrant)</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Blössner|2007|p=350}} Aristocracy is the form of government (''politeia'') advocated in Plato's''Republic''</span>
				<span class='text'>This regime is ruled by a philosopher king, and thus is grounded on wisdom and reason</span>
				<span class='text'>The aristocratic state, and the man whose nature corresponds to it, are the objects of Plato's analyses throughout much of the ''Republic'', as opposed to the other four types of states/men, who are discussed later in his work</span>
				<span class='text'>In Book VIII, Plato states in order the other four imperfect societies with a description of the state's structure and individual character</span>
				<span class='text'>In timocracy the ruling class is made up primarily of those with a warrior-like character</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{citeplato|Republic|550b}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his description, Plato has [[Sparta]] in mind</span>
				<span class='text'>Oligarchy is made up of a society in which wealth is the criterion of merit and the wealthy are in control</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{citeplato|Republic|554a}}&lt;/ref&gt; In democracy, the state bears resemblance to ancient Athens with traits such as equality of political opportunity and freedom for the individual to do as he likes</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{citeplato|Republic|561a–b}}&lt;/ref&gt; Democracy then degenerates into tyranny from the conflict of rich and poor</span>
				<span class='text'>It is characterized by an undisciplined society existing in chaos, where the tyrant rises as popular champion leading to the formation of his private army and the growth of oppression</span>

				<span class='text'>Many modern books on Plato seem to diminish its importance; nevertheless, the first important witness who mentions its existence is Aristotle, who in his ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' (209 b) writes: &quot;It is true, indeed, that the account he gives there [i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>in ''Timaeus''] of the participant is different from what he says in his so-called ''unwritten teachings'' (ἄγραφα δόγματα)</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The term &quot;ἄγραφα δόγματα&quot; literally means ''unwritten doctrines'' and it stands for the most fundamental metaphysical teaching of Plato, which he disclosed only orally, and some say only to his most trusted fellows, and which he may have kept secret from the public</span>
				<span class='text'>The importance of the unwritten doctrines does not seem to have been seriously questioned before the 19th century</span>
				<span class='text'> reason for not revealing it to everyone is partially discussed in ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'' (276 c) where Plato criticizes the written transmission of knowledge as faulty, favoring instead the spoken [[logos]]: &quot;he who has knowledge of the just and the good and beautiful </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>will not, when in earnest, write them in ink, sowing them through a pen with words, which cannot defend themselves by argument and cannot teach the truth effectually</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The same argument is repeated in Plato's ''[[Seventh Letter (Plato)|Seventh Letter]]'' (344 c): &quot;every serious man in dealing with really serious subjects carefully avoids writing</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; In the same letter he writes (341 c): &quot;I can certainly declare concerning all these writers who claim to know the subjects that I seriously study </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>there does not exist, nor will there ever exist, any treatise of mine dealing therewith</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Such secrecy is necessary in order not &quot;to expose them to unseemly and degrading treatment&quot; (344 d)</span>
				<span class='text'>t is, however, said that Plato once disclosed this knowledge to the public in his lecture ''On the Good'' (Περὶ τἀγαθοῦ), in which the Good (τὸ ἀγαθόν) is identified with the One (the Unity, τὸ ἕν), the fundamental ontological principle</span>
				<span class='text'>The content of this lecture has been transmitted by several witnesses</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Aristoxenus]] describes the event in the following words: &quot;Each came expecting to learn something about the things that are generally considered good for men, such as wealth, good health, physical strength, and altogether a kind of wonderful happiness</span>
				<span class='text'>But when the mathematical demonstrations came, including numbers, geometrical figures and astronomy, and finally the statement Good is One seemed to them, I imagine, utterly unexpected and strange; hence some belittled the matter, while others rejected it</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Their account is in full agreement with Aristotle's description of Plato's metaphysical doctrine</span>

				<span class='text'>&quot;From this account it is clear that he only employed two causes: that of the essence, and the material cause; for the Forms are the cause of the essence in everything else, and the One is the cause of it in the Forms</span>
				<span class='text'>He also tells us what the material substrate is of which the Forms are predicated in the case of sensible things, and the One in that of the Forms - that it is this the duality (the Dyad, ἡ δυάς), the Great and Small (τὸ μέγα καὶ τὸ μικρόν)</span>
				<span class='text'>Further, he assigned to these two elements respectively the causation of good and of evil&quot; (988 a)</span>
				<span class='text'>he most important aspect of this interpretation of Plato's metaphysics is the continuity between his teaching and the neoplatonic interpretation of [[Plotinus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Plotinus]] describes this in the last part of his final [[Enneads|Ennead]] (VI, 9) entitled ''On the Good, or the One'' (Περὶ τἀγαθοῦ ἢ τοῦ ἑνός)</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; which has been considered erroneous by many but may in fact have been directly influenced by oral transmission of Plato's doctrine</span>
				<span class='text'>A modern scholar who recognized the importance of the unwritten doctrine of Plato was [[Heinrich Gomperz]] who described it in his speech during the 7th [[International Congress of Philosophy]] in 1930</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Gomperz|1931}} All the sources related to the ἄγραφα δόγματα have been collected by Konrad Gaiser and published as ''Testimonia Platonica''</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Dialectic===The role of [[dialectic]] in Plato's thought is contested but there are two main interpretations: a type of reasoning and a method of intuition</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Blackburn|1996|p=104}} Simon Blackburn adopts the first, saying that Plato's dialectic is &quot;the process of eliciting the truth by means of questions aimed at opening out what is already implicitly known, or at exposing the contradictions and muddles of an opponent's position</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Blackburn|1996|p=104}} A similar interpretation has been put forth by Louis Hartz, who suggests that elements of the dialectic are borrowed from [[Hegel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hartz, Louis</span>
				<span class='text'>1984</span>
				<span class='text'>''A Synthesis of World History''</span>
				<span class='text'>Zurich: Humanity Press&lt;/ref&gt; According to this view, opposing arguments improve upon each other, and prevailing opinion is shaped by the synthesis of many conflicting ideas over time</span>
				<span class='text'>Each new idea exposes a flaw in the accepted model, and the epistemological substance of the debate continually approaches the truth</span>
				<span class='text'>Hartz's is a teleological interpretation at the core, in which philosophers will ultimately exhaust the available body of knowledge and thus reach &quot;the end of history</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Karl Popper, on the other hand, claims that dialectic is the art of intuition for &quot;visualising the divine originals, the Forms or Ideas, of unveiling the Great Mystery behind the common man's everyday world of appearances</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Popper|1962|p=133}}==Dialogues{{Anchor|Works|Plato's dialogues}}=={{see also|Stephanus pagination}}Thirty-five dialogues and thirteen letters (the [[Epistles (Plato)|''Epistles'']]) have traditionally been ascribed to Plato, though modern scholarship doubts the authenticity of at least some of these</span>
				<span class='text'>Plato's writings have been published in several fashions; this has led to several conventions regarding the naming and referencing of Plato's texts</span>
				<span class='text'>he usual system for making unique references to sections of the text by Plato derives from a 16th-century edition of Plato's works by [[Henri Estienne|Henricus Stephanus]]</span>

				<span class='text'>==Composition of the dialogues===No one knows the exact order Plato's dialogues were written in, nor the extent to which some might have been later revised and rewritten</span>
				<span class='text'>A significant distinction of the early Plato and the later Plato has been offered by scholars such as E</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Dodds and has been summarized by Harold Bloom in his book titled ''Agon'': &quot;E</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Dodds is the classical scholar whose writings most illuminated the Hellenic descent (in) ''The Greeks and the Irrational'' [</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> In his chapter on Plato and the Irrational Soul [</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> Dodds traces Plato's spiritual evolution from the pure rationalist of the ''Protagoras'' to the transcendental psychologist, influenced by the Pythagoreans and Orphics, of the later works culminating in the ''Laws''</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Bloom|1982|p=5}}[[Lewis Campbell (classicist)|Lewis Campbell]] was the first{{sfn|Burnet|1928b|p=9}} to make exhaustive use of [[stylometry]] to prove objectively that the ''Critias'', ''Timaeus'', ''Laws'', ''Philebus'', ''Sophist'', and ''Statesman'' were all clustered together as a group, while the ''Parmenides'', ''Phaedrus'', ''Republic'', and ''Theaetetus'' belong to a separate group, which must be earlier (given Aristotle's statement in his ''Politics''&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Politics'' [http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>7)</span>
				<span class='text'>What is remarkable about Campbell's conclusions is that, in spite of all the stylometric studies that have been conducted since his time, perhaps the only chronological fact about Plato's works that can now be said to be ''proven'' by stylometry is the fact that ''Critias'', ''Timaeus'', ''Laws'', ''Philebus'', ''Sophist'', and ''Statesman'' are the latest of Plato's dialogues, the others earlier</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Cooper|1997|p=xiv}}Increasingly in the most recent Plato scholarship, writers are skeptical of the notion that the order of Plato's writings can be established with any precision,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kraut|2013}}; {{harvnb|Schofield|2002}}; and {{harvnb|Rowe|2006}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; though Plato's works are still often characterized as falling at least roughly into three groups</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[#{{harvid|Brickhouse|Smith}}|Brickhouse &amp; Smith]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The following represents one relatively common such division</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; It should, however, be kept in mind that many of the positions in the ordering are still highly disputed, and also that the very notion that Plato's dialogues can or should be &quot;ordered&quot; is by no means universally accepted</span>
				<span class='text'>mong those who classify the dialogues into periods of composition, Socrates figures in all of the &quot;early dialogues&quot; and they are considered the most faithful representations of the historical Socrates</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Dodds|2004}} They include ''The Apology of Socrates'', ''Charmides'', ''Crito'', ''Euthyphro'', ''Ion'', ''Laches'', ''Lesser Hippias'', ''Lysis'', ''Menexenus'', and ''Protagoras'' (often considered one of the last of the &quot;early dialogues&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>Three dialogues are often considered &quot;transitional&quot; or &quot;pre-middle&quot;: ''Euthydemus'', ''Gorgias'', and ''Meno''</span>
				<span class='text'>hereas those classified as &quot;early dialogues&quot; often conclude in [[aporia]], the so-called &quot;middle dialogues&quot; provide more clearly stated positive teachings that are often ascribed to Plato such as the theory of Forms</span>
				<span class='text'>These dialogues include ''Cratylus'', ''Phaedo'', ''Phaedrus'', ''Republic'', ''Symposium'', ''Parmenides'', and ''Theaetetus''</span>
				<span class='text'>Proponents of dividing the dialogues into periods often consider the ''Parmenides'' and ''Theaetetus'' to come late in this period and be transitional to the next, as they seem to treat the theory of Forms critically (''Parmenides'') or only indirectly (''Theaetetus'')</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Brandwood|1990|p=251}} Ritter's stylometric analysis places ''Phaedrus'' as probably after ''Theaetetus'' and ''Parmenides'',{{sfn|Brandwood|1990|p=77}} although it does not relate to the theory of Forms in the same way</span>
				<span class='text'>The first book of the ''Republic'' is often thought to have been written significantly earlier than the rest of the work, although possibly having undergone revisions when the later books were attached to it</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Brandwood|1990|p=251}}The remaining dialogues are classified as &quot;late&quot; and are generally agreed to be difficult and challenging pieces of philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>This grouping is the only one proven by stylometric analysis</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Cooper|1997|p=xiv}} While looked to for Plato's &quot;mature&quot; answers to the questions posed by his earlier works, those answers are difficult to discern</span>
				<span class='text'>Some scholars{{sfn|Dodds|2004}} indicate that the theory of Forms is absent from the late dialogues, its having been refuted in the ''Parmenides'', but there isn't total consensus that the ''Parmenides'' actually refutes the theory of Forms</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Meinwald|1991}} The so-called &quot;late dialogues&quot; include ''Critias'', ''Laws'', ''Philebus'', ''Sophist'', ''Statesman'', and ''Timaeus''</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Dodds|2004}}===Narration of the dialogues===Plato never presents himself as a participant in any of the dialogues, and with the exception of the ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'', there is no suggestion that he heard any of the dialogues firsthand</span>
				<span class='text'>Some dialogues have no narrator but have a pure &quot;dramatic&quot; form (examples: ''[[Meno]]'', ''[[Gorgias (dialogue)|Gorgias]]'', ''[[Phaedrus (Plato)|Phaedrus]]'', ''[[Crito]]'', ''[[Euthyphro]]''), some dialogues are narrated by Socrates, wherein he speaks in first person (examples: ''[[Lysis (dialogue)|Lysis]]'', ''[[Charmides (dialogue)|Charmides]]'', ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'')</span>
				<span class='text'>One dialogue, ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]'', begins in dramatic form but quickly proceeds to Socrates' narration of a conversation he had previously with the sophist for whom the dialogue is named; this narration continues uninterrupted till the dialogue's end</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|[[Symposium (Plato)|Plato's Symposium]] ([[Anselm Feuerbach]], 1873)]]Two dialogues ''Phaedo'' and ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'' also begin in dramatic form but then proceed to virtually uninterrupted narration by followers of Socrates</span>
				<span class='text'>''Phaedo'', an account of Socrates' final conversation and hemlock drinking, is narrated by Phaedo to Echecrates in a foreign city not long after the execution took place</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;&quot;The time is not long after the death of Socrates; for the Pythagoreans [Echecrates &amp; co</span>
				<span class='text'> have not heard any details yet&quot; ({{harvnb|Burnet|1911|p=5}})</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The ''Symposium'' is narrated by Apollodorus, a Socratic disciple, apparently to Glaucon</span>
				<span class='text'>Apollodorus assures his listener that he is recounting the story, which took place when he himself was an infant, not from his own memory, but as remembered by Aristodemus, who told him the story years ago</span>
				<span class='text'>he ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'' is a peculiar case: a dialogue in dramatic form embedded within another dialogue in dramatic form</span>
				<span class='text'>In the beginning of the ''Theaetetus'' (142c-143b), [[Euclid of Megara|Euclides]] says that he compiled the conversation from notes he took based on what Socrates told him of his conversation with the title character</span>
				<span class='text'>The rest of the ''Theaetetus'' is presented as a &quot;book&quot; written in dramatic form and read by one of Euclides' slaves (143c)</span>
				<span class='text'>Some scholars take this as an indication that Plato had by this date wearied of the narrated form</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Burnet|1928a|loc=§177}} With the exception of the ''Theaetetus'', Plato gives no explicit indication as to how these orally transmitted conversations came to be written down</span>
				<span class='text'>==Trial of Socrates==={{Main|Trial of Socrates}}The trial of Socrates is the central, unifying event of the great Platonic dialogues</span>
				<span class='text'>Because of this, Plato's ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'' is perhaps the most often read of the dialogues</span>
				<span class='text'>In the ''Apology'', Socrates tries to dismiss rumors that he is a [[sophism|sophist]] and defends himself against charges of disbelief in the gods and corruption of the young</span>
				<span class='text'>Socrates insists that long-standing slander will be the real cause of his demise, and says the legal charges are essentially false</span>
				<span class='text'>Socrates famously denies being wise, and explains how his life as a philosopher was launched by the [[Oracle at Delphi]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He says that his quest to resolve the riddle of the oracle put him at odds with his fellow man, and that this is the reason he has been mistaken for a menace to the city-state of Athens</span>
				<span class='text'>f Plato's important dialogues do not refer to Socrates' execution explicitly, they allude to it, or use characters or themes that play a part in it</span>
				<span class='text'>Five dialogues foreshadow the trial: In the ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'' (210d) and the ''[[Euthyphro]]'' (2a–b) Socrates tells people that he is about to face corruption charges</span>
				<span class='text'>In the ''[[Meno]]'' (94e–95a), one of the men who brings legal charges against Socrates, [[Anytus]], warns him about the trouble he may get into if he does not stop criticizing important people</span>
				<span class='text'>In the ''[[Gorgias]]'', Socrates says that his trial will be like a doctor prosecuted by a cook who asks a jury of children to choose between the doctor's bitter medicine and the cook's tasty treats (521e–522a)</span>
				<span class='text'>In the ''[[Republic]]'' (7</span>
				<span class='text'>17e), Socrates explains why an enlightened man (presumably himself) will stumble in a courtroom situation</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''Apology'' is Socrates' defense speech, and the ''[[Crito]]'' and ''Phaedo'' take place in prison after the conviction</span>
				<span class='text'>In the ''[[Protagoras]]'', Socrates is a guest at the home of [[Callias III|Callias]], son of [[Hipponicus]], a man whom Socrates disparages in the ''Apology'' as having wasted a great amount of money on sophists' fees</span>
				<span class='text'>==Unity and diversity of the dialogues===Two other important dialogues, the ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'' and the ''[[Phaedrus (Plato)|Phaedrus]]'', are linked to the main storyline by characters</span>
				<span class='text'>In the ''Apology'' (19b, c), Socrates says [[Aristophanes]] slandered him in a comic play, and blames him for causing his bad reputation, and ultimately, his death</span>
				<span class='text'>In the ''Symposium'', the two of them are drinking together with other friends</span>
				<span class='text'>The character Phaedrus is linked to the main story line by character (Phaedrus is also a participant in the ''Symposium'' and the ''Protagoras'') and by theme (the philosopher as divine emissary, etc</span>
				<span class='text'> The ''Protagoras'' is also strongly linked to the ''Symposium'' by characters: all of the formal speakers at the ''Symposium'' (with the exception of Aristophanes) are present at the home of Callias in that dialogue</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Charmides]] and his guardian [[Critias]] are present for the discussion in the ''Protagoras''</span>
				<span class='text'>Examples of characters crossing between dialogues can be further multiplied</span>

				<span class='text'>It is believed that Plethon passed a copy of the Dialogues to [[Cosimo de' Medici]] when in 1438 the [[Council of Ferrara]], called to unify the Greek and Latin Churches, was adjourned to Florence, where Plethon then lectured on the relation and differences of Plato and Aristotle, and fired Cosimo with his enthusiasm;{{sfn|Lackner|2001|p=21}} Cosimo would supply [[Marsilio Ficino]] with Plato's text for translation to Latin</span>
				<span class='text'>During the early Islamic era, [[Iran|Persian]] and Arab scholars translated much of Plato into Arabic and wrote [[Close reading|commentaries]] and interpretations on Plato's, Aristotle's and other Platonist philosophers' works (see [[Al-Farabi]], [[Avicenna]], [[Averroes]], [[Hunayn ibn Ishaq]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of these comments on Plato were translated from Arabic into Latin and as such influenced Medieval scholastic philosophers</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;During the [[Renaissance]], with the general resurgence of interest in classical civilization, knowledge of Plato's philosophy would become widespread again in the West</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of the greatest early modern scientists and artists who broke with [[Scholasticism]] and fostered the flowering of the Renaissance, with the support of the Plato-inspired [[Lorenzo de' Medici|Lorenzo]] (grandson of Cosimo), saw Plato's philosophy as the basis for progress in the arts and sciences</span>
				<span class='text'>His political views, too, were well-received: the vision of wise philosopher-kings of the ''Republic'' matched the views set out in works such as [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]]'s ''[[The Prince]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>More problematic was Plato's belief in [[metempsychosis]], transmigration of the soul, as well as his ethical views (on [[polyamory]] and [[euthanasia]] in particular), which did not match those of Christianity</span>
				<span class='text'>It was Plethon's student [[Basilios Bessarion|Bessarion]] who reconciled Plato with Christian theology, arguing that Plato's views were only ideals, unattainable due to the [[fall of man]]</span>

				<span class='text'>tml}}&lt;/ref&gt;By the 19th century, Plato's reputation was restored, and at least on par with Aristotle's</span>
				<span class='text'>Notable Western philosophers have continued to draw upon Plato's work since that time</span>
				<span class='text'>Plato's influence has been especially strong in mathematics and the sciences</span>
				<span class='text'>He helped to distinguish between [[pure mathematics|pure]] and [[applied mathematics]] by widening the gap between &quot;arithmetic&quot;, now called [[number theory]] and &quot;logistic&quot;, now called [[arithmetic]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He regarded &quot;logistic&quot; as appropriate for business men and men of war who &quot;must learn the art of numbers or he will not know how to array his troops,&quot; while &quot;arithmetic&quot; was appropriate for philosophers &quot;because he has to arise out of the sea of change and lay hold of true being</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyer|1991|p=86}}: 'Plato is important in the history of mathematics largely for his role as inspirer and director of others, and perhaps to him is due the sharp distinction in ancient Greece between arithmetic (in the sense of the theory of numbers) and logistic (the technique of computation)</span>
				<span class='text'>Plato regarded logistic as appropriate for the businessman and for the man of war, who &quot;must learn the art of numbers or he will not know how to array his troops</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The philosopher, on the other hand, must be an arithmetician &quot;because he has to arise out of the sea of change and lay hold of true being</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;'&lt;/ref&gt; Plato's resurgence further inspired some of the greatest advances in logic since Aristotle, primarily through [[Gottlob Frege]] and his followers [[Kurt Gödel]], [[Alonzo Church]], and [[Alfred Tarski]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Albert Einstein]] suggested that the scientist who takes philosophy seriously would have to avoid systematization and take on many different roles, and possibly appear as a Platonist or Pythagorean, in that such a one would have &quot;the viewpoint of logical simplicity as an indispensable and effective tool of his research</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Einstein|1949|pp=683–684}}Many recent philosophers have diverged from what some would describe as the [[ontology|ontological]] models and [[moral]] ideals characteristic of traditional Platonism</span>
				<span class='text'>A number of these postmodern philosophers have thus appeared to disparage Platonism from more or less informed perspectives</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] notoriously attacked Plato's &quot;idea of the good itself&quot; along with many fundamentals of Christian morality, which he interpreted as &quot;Platonism for the masses&quot; in one of his most important works, ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]] ''(1886)</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Martin Heidegger]] argued against Plato's alleged obfuscation of ''[[Being]] ''in his incomplete tome, ''[[Being and Time]]'' (1927), and the philosopher of science [[Karl Popper]] argued in ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'' (1945) that Plato's alleged proposal for a [[utopia]]n political regime in the ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' was prototypically [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The political philosopher and professor [[Leo Strauss]] is considered by some as the prime thinker involved in the recovery of Platonic thought in its more political, and less metaphysical, form</span>
				<span class='text'>Strauss' political approach was in part inspired by the appropriation of Plato and Aristotle by medieval [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish]] and [[Islamic philosophy|Islamic]] [[political philosophy|political philosophers]], especially [[Maimonides]] and [[Al-Farabi]], as opposed to the Christian metaphysical tradition that developed from [[Neoplatonism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Deeply influenced by Nietzsche and Heidegger, Strauss nonetheless rejects their condemnation of Plato and looks to the dialogues for a solution to what all three latter day thinkers acknowledge as 'the crisis of the West</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Nails|2006|p=1}} According to [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] Plato died at the age of 81 on the same day he was born</span>

				<span class='text'>'' {{Note label|C|c|none}} Diogenes Laertius mentions that Plato &quot;was born, according to some writers, in Aegina in the house of Phidiades the son of Thales&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Diogenes mentions as one of his sources the ''Universal History'' of [[Favorinus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Favorinus, Ariston, Plato's family, and his family were sent by Athens to settle as [[cleruchy|cleruch]]s (colonists retaining their Athenian citizenship), on the island of Aegina, from which they were expelled by the Spartans after Plato's birth there</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;LaIII&quot;&gt;Diogenes Laertius, ''Life of Plato'', III&lt;/ref&gt; Nails points out, however, that there is no record of any Spartan expulsion of Athenians from Aegina between 431–411 BCE</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Nails|2002|p=54}} On the other hand, at the [[Peace of Nicias]], Aegina was silently left under Athens' control, and it was not until the summer of 411 that the Spartans overran the island</span>

				<span class='text'>2]]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Nails concludes that &quot;perhaps Ariston was a cleruch, perhaps he went to Aegina in 431, and perhaps Plato was born on Aegina, but none of this enables a precise dating of Ariston's death (or Plato's birth)</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Nails|2002|p=54}} Aegina is regarded as Plato's place of birth by Suda as well</span>
