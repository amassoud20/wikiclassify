				<span class='text'>esey was born in [[La Junta, Colorado]] and grew up in [[Springfield, Oregon]], graduating from the [[University of Oregon]] in 1957</span>
				<span class='text'>He began writing ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (novel)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'' in 1960 following the completion of a graduate fellowship in creative writing at [[Stanford University]]; the novel was an immediate commercial and critical success when published two years later</span>
				<span class='text'>Subsequently, he moved to nearby [[La Honda, California]] and began hosting [[happenings]] with former colleagues from Stanford, miscellaneous bohemian &amp; literary figures (most notably [[Neal Cassady]]), and other friends under the imprimateur of the [[Merry Pranksters]]; these parties, known as [[Acid Tests]], integrated the consumption of [[LSD]] with multimedia performances</span>
				<span class='text'>He mentored the [[Grateful Dead]] (the ''de facto'' &quot;house band&quot; of the Acid Tests) throughout their incipience and continued to exert a profound influence upon the group throughout their long career</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[Sometimes a Great Notion]]''—an epic account of the vicissitudes of an Oregon logging family that aspired to the [[modernist]] grandeur of [[William Faulkner]]'s [[Yoknapatawpha]] saga—was a commercial success that polarized critics and readers upon its release in 1964, although Kesey regarded the novel as his magnum opus</span>

				<span class='text'>He claimed never to have seen the movie because of a dispute over the $20,000 he was initially paid for the film rights</span>
				<span class='text'>Kesey loathed the fact that, unlike the book, the film was not narrated by the Chief Bromden character, and he disagreed with Jack Nicholson's being cast as Randle McMurphy (he wanted [[Gene Hackman]])</span>

				<span class='text'>In an interview after arriving in New York, Kesey is quoted as saying, &quot;The sense of communication in this country has damn near atrophied</span>
