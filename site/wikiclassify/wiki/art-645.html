				<span class='text'>She died when he was ten months old,{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} possibly from a [[brain tumor]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Gable's father refused to raise him as a Catholic, provoking scorn and criticism from his mother's side of the family</span>
				<span class='text'>The dispute was resolved when his father's family agreed to allow Gable to spend time with his uncle, Charles Hershelman, and his wife on their farm in [[Vernon Township, Crawford County, Pennsylvania|Vernon Township, Pennsylvania]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=December 2014}}In April 1903 Gable's father married Jennie Dunlap (1874–1924), whose family came from the small neighboring town of [[Hopedale, Ohio|Hopedale]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Will's marriage to Jennie produced no half brothers or sisters for Clark</span>
				<span class='text'>Gable was a tall, shy child with a loud voice</span>
				<span class='text'>After his father purchased some land and built a house, the new family settled in</span>
				<span class='text'>Jennie played the piano and gave her stepson lessons at home; later he took up brass instruments</span>
				<span class='text'>She raised Gable to be well-dressed and well-groomed; he stood out from the other kids</span>
				<span class='text'>Gable was very mechanically inclined and loved to strip down and repair cars with his father</span>
				<span class='text'>At thirteen he was the only boy in the men's town band</span>
				<span class='text'>Even though his father insisted on Gable doing &quot;manly&quot; things, like hunting and hard physical work, Gable loved language</span>
				<span class='text'>Among trusted company, he would recite Shakespeare, particularly the sonnets</span>
				<span class='text'>Will Gable did agree to buy a seventy-two volume set of ''The World's Greatest Literature'' to improve his son's education, but claimed he never saw his son use it</span>

				<span class='text'>He had trouble settling down in the area</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|&quot;The Wife Gable Forgot&quot;]]At seventeen, Clark Gable was inspired to be an actor after seeing the play ''The Bird of Paradise'', but he was not able to make a real start until he turned 21 and inherited some money</span>
				<span class='text'>By then his stepmother Jennie had died and his father moved to [[Tulsa]] to go back to the oil business</span>
				<span class='text'>He toured in stock companies as well as working the oil fields and as a horse manager</span>
				<span class='text'>Gable found work with several second-class theater companies and thus made his way across the Midwest to [[Seaside, Oregon]], working as a logger and to [[Portland, Oregon]], where he then took work as a necktie salesman in the [[Meier &amp; Frank]] department store</span>
				<span class='text'>While there he met [[Laura Hope Crews]], a stage and film actress, who encouraged him to return to the stage and into another theater company</span>
				<span class='text'>Many years later Crews would play Aunt Pittypat in ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone With the Wind]]'' (1939)</span>
				<span class='text'>is acting coach was a theater manager in Portland named [[Josephine Dillon]], who was 17 years his senior</span>
				<span class='text'>She paid to have his teeth repaired and his hair styled</span>
				<span class='text'>She guided him in building up his chronically undernourished body, and taught him better body control and posture</span>
				<span class='text'>She spent considerable time training his naturally high-pitched voice, which Gable slowly managed to lower, and to gain better resonance and tone</span>
				<span class='text'>As his speech habits improved, Gable's facial expressions became more natural and convincing</span>
				<span class='text'>After the long period of rigorous training, Dillon eventually considered him ready to attempt a film career</span>

				<span class='text'>He appeared as an extra in Fox's ''[[The Johnstown Flood (1926 film)|The Johnstown Flood]]'' (1926) and, by coincidence, 17-year-old [[Carole Lombard]] also appeared as an extra in the film, although they were not in the same scene</span>
				<span class='text'>Gable also appeared as a bit player in a series of shorts</span>
				<span class='text'>owever, he was not offered any major roles in Hollywood and so he returned to the stage</span>
				<span class='text'>He became lifelong friends with [[Lionel Barrymore]], who in spite of his bawling Gable out for amateurish acting initially, urged Gable to pursue a career on stage</span>

				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|Mary Astor and Clark Gable in ''Red Dust'', 1932]]In 1930, after his impressive appearance as the seething and desperate character Killer Mears in the Los Angeles stage production of ''The Last Mile'', Gable was offered a contract with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His first role in a sound picture was as the unshaven villain in a low-budget [[William Boyd (actor)|William Boyd]] [[Western (genre)|western]] called ''[[The Painted Desert]]'' (1931)</span>
				<span class='text'>He received a lot of [[fan mail]] as a result of his powerful voice and appearance; the studio took notice</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1930, Gable and Josephine Dillon were divorced</span>
				<span class='text'>A few days later, he married [[Texas]] socialite Maria Franklin Prentiss Lucas Langham, nicknamed &quot;Rhea&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>After moving to [[California]], they were married again in 1931, possibly due to differences in state legal requirements</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;His ears are too big and he looks like an ape&quot;, said executive [[Darryl F</span>
				<span class='text'>Zanuck]], then at [[Warner Bros</span>
				<span class='text'>], about Clark Gable after testing him for the lead in the studio's gangster drama ''[[Little Caesar (film)|Little Caesar]]'' (1931)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;TCM&quot; /&gt; The same year, in ''[[Night Nurse (1931 film)|Night Nurse]]'', Gable played a villainous chauffeur who was gradually starving two adorable little girls to death, then knocked [[Barbara Stanwyck]]'s character unconscious with his fist, a supporting role originally slated for [[James Cagney]] until the release of ''[[The Public Enemy]]'' abruptly made Cagney a [[leading man]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After several failed screen tests for Barrymore and Zanuck, Gable was signed in 1930 by MGM's [[Irving Thalberg]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He became a client of well-connected agent Minna Wallis, sister of producer [[Hal Wallis]] and a very close friend of [[Norma Shearer]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Gable's timing in arriving in Hollywood was excellent, as MGM was looking to expand its stable of male stars and he fitted the bill</span>
				<span class='text'>Gable first worked mainly in supporting roles, often as the villain</span>
				<span class='text'>He made two pictures in 1931 with [[Wallace Beery]], a supporting role in ''[[The Secret Six]]'', then with his part increasing in size to almost match Beery's in the naval aviation film ''[[Hell Divers]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>MGM's publicity manager [[Howard Strickling]] developed Gable's studio image, playing up his he-man experiences and his 'lumberjack in evening clothes' persona</span>

				<span class='text'>[[Joan Crawford]] asked for him as her co-star in ''[[Dance, Fools, Dance]]'' (1931)</span>
				<span class='text'>He built his fame and public visibility in such movies as ''[[A Free Soul]]'' (1931), in which he played a gangster who shoved the character played by Norma Shearer (Gable never played a supporting role again)</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote &quot;A star in the making has been made, one that, to our reckoning, will outdraw every other star</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Never have we seen audiences work themselves into such enthusiasm as when Clark Gable walks on the screen&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;H17&quot; /&gt; He followed that with ''[[Susan Lenox (Her Fall and Rise)]]'' (1931) with [[Greta Garbo]], and ''[[Possessed (1931 film)|Possessed]]'' (1931), in which he and Crawford (then married to [[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr</span>
				<span class='text'>]) steamed up the screen</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Adela Rogers St</span>

				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=November 2012}}Gable was considered for the role of ''[[Tarzan the Ape Man (1932 film)|Tarzan the Ape Man]]'' but lost out to [[Johnny Weissmuller]]'s more imposing physique and superior swimming prowess</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Gable's unshaven lovemaking with [[bra]]less [[Jean Harlow]] in ''[[Red Dust]]'' (1932) soon made him MGM's most important male star</span>
				<span class='text'>After the hit ''[[Hold Your Man]]'' (1933), MGM recognized the goldmine of the Gable-Harlow pairing, putting them in two more films, ''[[China Seas (1935 film)|China Seas]]'' (1935; with Gable and Harlow billed above [[Wallace Beery]]) and ''[[Wife vs</span>
				<span class='text'>Secretary]]'' (1936) with [[Myrna Loy]] and [[James Stewart]]</span>
				<span class='text'>An enormously popular combination, on-screen and off-screen, Gable and Harlow made six films together, the most notable being ''[[Red Dust]]'' (1932) and ''[[Saratoga (1937 film)|Saratoga]]'' (1937)</span>
				<span class='text'>Harlow died during production of ''Saratoga''</span>

				<span class='text'> Despite being onscreen for only seventeen minutes, the appearance immediately catapulted Tracy, whose career had floundered for years despite delivering superb performances in quality films, into major stardom in the wake of the picture becoming the year's biggest box office attraction</span>
				<span class='text'> ''[[Test Pilot (film)|Test Pilot]]'' (1938) gave Tracy a larger supporting part as the agonizing friend of Gable's glamorous pilot while ''[[Boom Town (film)|Boom Town]]'' (1940) depicted an epic rivalry between Gable and Tracy's characters over [[Claudette Colbert]] and their oil businesses</span>
				<span class='text'> Each pairing was a box office phenomenon</span>
				<span class='text'> MGM had teamed Tracy with Gable every two years until Tracy finally insisted upon a [[Billing (filmmaking)|star billing]] clause in his contract, ending any further Gable-Tracy collaborations</span>

				<span class='text'>They met while filming 1932's ''[[No Man of Her Own (1932 film)|No Man of Her Own]]'', when Lombard was still married to actor [[William Powell]], but their romance did not take off until 1936</span>
				<span class='text'>They became reacquainted at a party and soon were inseparable, cited in fan magazines and tabloids as an official couple</span>
				<span class='text'>Gable thrived being around Lombard's youthful, charming, and frank personality, once stating, &quot;You can trust that little screwball with your life or your hopes or your weaknesses, and she wouldn't even know how to think about letting you down</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;H130&quot; /&gt; Lombard, for her part, seemed to gain personal stability and a contented home life that she had previously lacked</span>
				<span class='text'>She taught herself how to hunt and fish and accompanied Gable on trips with his hunting companions</span>
				<span class='text'>ut Gable, who was still legally married, prolonged a lengthy and expensive divorce from his second wife Rhea Langham</span>
				<span class='text'>His salary from ''Gone with the Wind'' enabled him to reach a divorce settlement with Langham, however, on March 7, 1939</span>
				<span class='text'>On March 29, during a production break on ''Gone with the Wind'', Gable and Lombard were married in [[Kingman, Arizona]], honeymooning in the nearby mining town of [[Oatman, Arizona|Oatman]]</span>

				<span class='text'>She had just finished her 57th movie, ''[[To Be or Not to Be (1942 film)|To Be or Not to Be]]'', and was on her way home from a successful [[war bond]] selling tour when the flight's [[DC-3]] airliner crashed into a mountain near [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], killing all 22 passengers aboard, including 15 servicemen en route to training in California</span>
				<span class='text'>Gable flew to the crash site to claim the bodies of his wife, mother-in-law, and Winkler, who had been the best man at Gable's and Lombard's wedding</span>

				<span class='text'>A month later he returned to the studio to work with [[Lana Turner]] in the movie ''[[Somewhere I'll Find You]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Having lost twenty pounds since the tragedy, it was evident that Gable was emotionally and physically devastated by it</span>
				<span class='text'>But Turner stated that Gable remained a professional for the duration of filming</span>

				<span class='text'>His class of about 2,600 fellow students (of which he ranked about 700th in class standing) selected Gable as its graduation speaker, at which General Arnold presented the cadets with their commissions</span>
				<span class='text'>Arnold then informed Gable of his special assignment: to make a recruiting film in combat with the [[Eighth Air Force]] to recruit aerial gunners</span>
				<span class='text'>Gable and McIntyre were immediately sent to Flexible Gunnery School at [[Tyndall Air Force Base|Tyndall Field, Florida]], followed by a photography course at [[Fort George Wright]], [[Washington State University|Washington State]] and promoted to [[US First Lieutenant|first lieutenants]] upon its completion</span>

				<span class='text'>During one of the missions, Gable's aircraft was damaged by flak and attacked by fighters, which knocked out one of the engines and shot up the stabilizer</span>
				<span class='text'>In the raid on Germany, one crewman was killed and two others were wounded, and flak went through Gable's boot and narrowly missed his head</span>
				<span class='text'>When word of this reached MGM, studio executives began to badger the Army Air Forces to reassign its most valuable screen actor to noncombat duty</span>
				<span class='text'>In November 1943, Gable returned to the United States to edit his film, only to find that the personnel shortage of aerial gunners had already been rectified</span>
				<span class='text'>He was allowed to complete the film anyway, joining the [[First Motion Picture Unit]] in [[Hollywood, California]]</span>

				<span class='text'>He hoped for another combat assignment but, when the [[Normandy landings|invasion of Normandy]] came and went in June without any further orders, Gable was relieved from active duty as a major on June 12, 1944 at his request, since he was over-age for combat</span>

				<span class='text'>He introduced his golf caddie [[Robert Wagner]] to MGM casting</span>
				<span class='text'>Gable's first movie after [[World War II]] was ''[[Adventure (1945 film)|Adventure]]'' (1945), with his ill-matched co-star [[Greer Garson]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It was a critical and commercial failure despite the famous teaser tagline &quot;Gable's back and Garson's got him&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>fter Joan Crawford's third divorce, she and Gable resumed their affair and lived together for a brief time</span>
				<span class='text'>Gable was acclaimed for his performance in ''[[The Hucksters]]'' (1947), a satire of post-war Madison Avenue corruption and immorality</span>
				<span class='text'>A very public and brief romance with [[Paulette Goddard]] occurred after that</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1949, Gable married [[Sylvia Ashley]], a British divorcée and the widow of [[Douglas Fairbanks]]</span>

				<span class='text'>His first two films in this new situation were ''[[Soldier of Fortune (1955 film)|Soldier of Fortune]]'' and ''[[The Tall Men (film)|The Tall Men]]'' (both 1955), which were profitable, although only modest successes</span>

				<span class='text'>ISBN 978-0-399-11542-4&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Niven]] states that Gable, a close friend, was extremely supportive after the sudden, accidental death of Niven's first wife, Primula (Primmie) in 1946</span>
				<span class='text'>Primmie had supported Gable emotionally after Carole Lombard's death four years earlier: Niven recounts Gable kneeling at Primmie's feet and sobbing while she held and consoled him</span>
				<span class='text'>Niven also states that [[Arthur Miller]], the author of ''The Misfits'', had described Gable as &quot;the man who did not know how to hate&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>able has been criticized for altering critical aspects of a script when he felt that the script would not fit in with his image</span>

				<span class='text'>ISBN 978-0-15-603169-1</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; also states that Wallach's most dramatic scene in ''The Misfits'' was cut from the movie after it had been filmed over several takes</span>
				<span class='text'>This scene depicts Wallach's character (who secretly loves the character played by Marilyn Monroe), being emotionally crushed when he visits her, hoping to propose to her, and instead sees her with Gable's character</span>
				<span class='text'>Both Gable and Monroe are offscreen, and Wallach's heartbreak is indicated by his dropping the rose bouquet he had brought for her</span>
				<span class='text'>Gable ordered the scene removed because he felt that his character would never steal a woman from another man</span>
				<span class='text'>Wallach, however, refrains from criticizing Gable, noting that he was professional and considerate in his behavior</span>
				<span class='text'>= Filmography =={{Main|Clark Gable filmography}}Gable is known to have appeared as an extra in 13 films between 1924 and 1930</span>
				<span class='text'>He then appeared in a total of 67 theatrically released motion pictures, as himself in 17 &quot;short subject&quot; films, and he narrated and appeared in a World War II [[propaganda]] film entitled ''[[Combat America]]'', produced by the United States Army Air Forces</span>
				<span class='text'>= In popular culture ==[[Warner Bros</span>
				<span class='text'>] cartoons sometimes caricatured Gable</span>
				<span class='text'>Examples include ''[[Have You Got Any Castles?]]'' (in which his [[face]] appears seven times inside the novel ''[[The House of the Seven Gables]]''), ''[[The Coo-Coo Nut Grove]]'' (in which his ears flap on their own), ''[[Hollywood Steps Out]]'' (in which he follows an enigmatic woman), and ''[[Cats Don't Dance]]'' in which he appears on a billboard promotion for ''Gone With The Wind''</span>
				<span class='text'>he 2003 album ''[[Give Up]]'' by electronic music group [[The Postal Service]] includes a song titled &quot;Clark Gable&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The song's narrator says he wants love like something in the movies, and includes the lyrics &quot;I kissed you in a style Clark Gable would have admired, I thought it classic&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>n the film ''[[Broadway Melody of 1938]]'', [[Judy Garland]] (aged 15) sings &quot;[[You Made Me Love You (I Didn't Want to Do It)|You Made Me Love You]]&quot; while looking at a composite picture of Gable</span>
				<span class='text'>The opening lines are: &quot;Dear Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Gable, I am writing this to you, and I hope that you will read it so you'll know, my heart beats like a hammer, and I stutter and I stammer, every time I see you at the picture show, I guess I'm just another fan of yours, and I thought I'd write and tell you so</span>
				<span class='text'>You made me love you, I didn't want to do it, I didn't want to do it</span>

				<span class='text'>n the film ''[[Captain Ron]]'', the Harvey boat was said to be owned by Clark Gable</span>
				<span class='text'>[Bugs Bunny]]'s nonchalant carrot-chewing standing position, as explained by [[Chuck Jones]], [[Friz Freleng]], and [[Bob Clampett]], originated in a scene in the film ''[[It Happened One Night]]'', in which Clark Gable's character leans against a fence, eating carrots rapidly and talking with his mouth full to [[Claudette Colbert]]'s character</span>
				<span class='text'>This scene was well known while the film was popular, and viewers at the time likely recognized Bugs Bunny's behavior as satire</span>
				<span class='text'>able was mentioned along with [[Cary Grant]] and [[Tyrone Power]] by [[Etta Candy]] in a 1977 Hollywood-themed episode of ''[[Wonder Woman (TV series)|Wonder Woman]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>able is mentioned in the lyrics, &quot;Between our quests we sequin vests/And impersonate Clark Gable,&quot; in the musical number, &quot;Knights of the Round Table,&quot; from ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>able has been portrayed in films by [[James Brolin]] in ''[[Gable and Lombard]]'' (1976), [[Larry Pennell]] in ''[[Marilyn: The Untold Story]]'' (1980), [[Edward Winter (actor)|Edward Winter]] in ''[[Moviola: The Scarlett O'Hara War]]'' (1980), Boyd Holister in ''[[Grace Kelly]]'' (1983), [[Gary Wayne]] in ''[[Malice in Wonderland (1985 film)|Malice in Wonderland]]'' (1985), Gene Daily in ''[[The Rocketeer]]'' (1991), Bruce Hughes and Shayne Greenman in ''[[Blonde (film)|Blonde]]'' (2001), Charles Unwin in ''[[Lucy (2003 film)|Lucy]]'' (2003), and Kyle MacLachlan in &quot;Touch of Pink&quot; (2004)</span>

				<span class='text'>n the ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' episode &quot;[[The City on the Edge of Forever]],&quot; Edith Keeler suggests that she and [[James T</span>
