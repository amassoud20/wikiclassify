				<span class='text'>gg|Oda Nobunaga}}|June 23, 1534&amp;nbsp;– June 21, 1582}} was a powerful [[daimyo]] of [[Japan]] in the late 16th century who attempted to unify Japan during the late [[Sengoku period]]</span>
				<span class='text'>he goal of national unification and a return to the comparative political stability of the earlier [[Muromachi period]] was widely shared by the multitude of autonomous daimyo during the Sengoku period</span>
				<span class='text'>Oda Nobunaga however, was the first for which this goal seemed attainable</span>
				<span class='text'>Nobunaga had gained control over most of [[Honshu]] (see map below), before his death during the 1582 [[Honnō-ji incident]], a coup attempt executed by Nobunaga's vassal, [[Akechi Mitsuhide]]</span>
				<span class='text'> It is not certain if Nobunaga was killed in the attack or if he committed [[seppuku]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The motivation of Mitsuhide's betrayal was never revealed to anyone who survived the incident, and has been a subject of debate and conjecture ever since the incident</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berry|first1=Mary Elizabeth|title=Hideyoshi|date=1982|publisher=The Council on East Asian Studies, Harvard University|location=Cambridge and London|isbn=0-674-39026-1|pages=41-43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the incident, [[Akechi Mitsuhide]] declared himself master over Nobunaga's domains, but was quickly defeated by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], who regained control of and greatly expanded the Oda holdings</span>
				<span class='text'> Oda Nobunaga's successful subjugation of much of [[Honshu]] enabled the later successes of his allies [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] and [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] toward the goal of national unification by subjugating local [[daimyo]] under a hereditary [[shogunate]], which would ultimately be accomplished in 1603 when [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] was granted the title of [[shogun]] by [[Emperor Go-Yōzei|Go-Yōzei-tennō]] following the successful [[Battle of Sekigahara|Sekigahara Campaign]] of 1600</span>
				<span class='text'>The nature of the succession of power through the three daimyō is reflected in the Japanese idiom: &quot;Nobunaga pounds the national rice cake, Hideyoshi kneads it, and in the end Ieyasu sits down and eats it</span>

				<span class='text'>} Tale 3 - ''His Extraordinary Appearance''&lt;/ref&gt; This convinced many Oda retainers of Nobunaga's mediocrity and lack of discipline</span>
				<span class='text'>Alienated, they then began to side with his soft-spoken and well-mannered brother, [[Oda Nobuyuki|Nobuyuki]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Hirate Masahide]], a valuable mentor and retainer to Nobunaga, was ashamed by Nobunaga's behavior and performed ''[[seppuku]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>This had a huge effect on Nobunaga, who later built a temple to honor Masahide</span>
				<span class='text'>==Succession dispute===Though Nobunaga was Nobuhide's legitimate successor, the [[Oda clan]] was divided into many factions, and the clan was technically under the control of Owari's ''[[shugo]]'', [[Shiba Yoshimune]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Oda Nobutomo]], the deceased Nobuhide's brother and deputy to the ''shugo'', used the weak Yoshimune as his puppet and challenged Nobunaga's place as Owari's new ruler</span>
				<span class='text'>Nobutomo murdered Yoshimune when it was discovered that he supported and attempted to aid Nobunaga</span>
				<span class='text'>obunaga persuaded Oda Nobumitsu, a younger brother of Nobuhide, to join his side and, with Nobumitsu's help, slew Nobutomo in [[Kiyosu Castle]], which later became Nobunaga's place of residence for over ten years</span>
				<span class='text'>Taking advantage of the position of Shiba Yoshikane, Yoshimune's son, as the rightful ''shugo'', Nobunaga forged an alliance with the [[Imagawa clan]] of [[Suruga Province]] and the [[Kira clan]] of [[Mikawa Province]], as both clans had the same ''shugo'' and would have no excuse to decline</span>
				<span class='text'>This also ensured that the Imagawa clan would have to stop attacking Owari's borders</span>
				<span class='text'>hough Nobuyuki and his supporters were still at large, Nobunaga brought an army to [[Mino Province]] to aid [[Saitō Dōsan]] after Dōsan's son, [[Saitō Yoshitatsu]], turned against him</span>
				<span class='text'>The campaign failed, as Dōsan was killed, and Yoshitatsu became the new master of Mino in 1556</span>
				<span class='text'>==Elimination of Nobuyuki===A few months later Nobuyuki, with support from [[Shibata Katsuie]] and [[Hayashi Hidesada]], rebelled against Nobunaga</span>
				<span class='text'>The conspirators were defeated at the [[Battle of Inō]], but were pardoned after the intervention of [[Tsuchida Gozen]], the birth mother of Nobunaga and Nobuyuki</span>
				<span class='text'>The next year, Nobuyuki again planned to rebel</span>
				<span class='text'>Nobunaga was informed of this by Shibata Katsuie, then faked illness to get close to Nobuyuki and assassinated him in Kiyosu Castle</span>
				<span class='text'>y 1559, Nobunaga had eliminated all opposition within the clan and [[Owari Province]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He continued to use Shiba Yoshikane as a pretext to make peace with other daimyo, though it was later discovered that Yoshikane had secretly corresponded with the Kira and Imagawa clans, attempting to oust Nobunaga and restore the [[Shiba clan]]'s place</span>
				<span class='text'>Nobunaga eventually cast him out, voiding alliances created in the Shiba clan's name</span>

				<span class='text'>The [[Matsudaira clan]] of [[Mikawa Province]] also joined Yoshimoto's forces</span>
				<span class='text'>Against this, the Oda clan could rally an army of only 3,000,&lt;ref&gt;Weston, Mark</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and the forces needed to be split up to defend various border forts</span>
				<span class='text'>Under such circumstances, Nobunaga was said to have performed his favorite Atsumori dance at Kiyosu Castle, before riding off with only a few attendants to pray</span>
				<span class='text'>Due to the sheer imbalance in the forces available to the two clans the night before, [[Shibata Katsuie]] had tried in vain to change Nobunaga's mind about a frontal attack; he kept reminding Nobunaga of the joint army's lack of manpower compared to Imagawa's numerous soldiers</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} [[Hayashi Hidesada]], the remaining advisor from Nobuhide's days, even argued for surrender without fighting, using the same reasoning as Katsuie</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}Nobunaga's scouts reported that Yoshimoto was resting at the narrow gorge of Dengaku-hazama, ideal for a surprise attack, and that the Imagawa army were celebrating their victories while Yoshimoto viewed the heads</span>
				<span class='text'>Nobunaga moved towards Imagawa's camp, and set up a position some distance away</span>
				<span class='text'>An array of flags and dummy troops made of straw and spare helmets gave the impression of a large host, while the real Oda army hurried round in a rapid march to get behind Yoshimoto's camp</span>
				<span class='text'>The heat gave way to a terrific thunderstorm</span>
				<span class='text'>As the Imagawa samurai sheltered from the rain Nobunaga deployed his troops, and when the storm ceased they charged down upon the enemy in the gorge, so suddenly that Yoshimoto thought a brawl had broken out among his men, only realizing it was an attack when two samurai charged up</span>
				<span class='text'>One aimed a spear at him, which Yoshimoto deflected with his sword, but the second swung his blade and [[Decapitation|cut off]] Imagawa's head</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1561, an alliance was forged between Oda Nobunaga and Matsudaira Motoyasu (who would become Tokugawa Ieyasu), despite the decades-old hostility between the two clans</span>
				<span class='text'>Tradition dates this battle as the first time that Nobunaga noticed the talents of the [[sandal-bearer]] who would eventually become Toyotomi Hideyoshi</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|Statue of Oda Nobunaga at [[Kiyosu Castle]]]]In Mino, Saitō Yoshitatsu died suddenly of illness in 1561, and was succeeded by his son, [[Saitō Tatsuoki]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Tatsuoki, however, was young and much less effective as a ruler and military strategist compared to his father and grandfather</span>
				<span class='text'>Taking advantage of this situation, Nobunaga moved his base to Komaki Castle and started his campaign in Mino</span>
				<span class='text'>By convincing Saitō retainers to abandon their incompetent and foolish master, Nobunaga weakened the [[Saitō clan]] significantly, eventually mounting a final attack in 1567</span>
				<span class='text'>Nobunaga [[Siege of Inabayama Castle|captured Inabayama Castle]] and sent Tatsuoki into exile</span>
				<span class='text'>fter taking possession of the castle, Nobunaga changed the name of both [[Gifu Castle|the castle]] and the surrounding town to [[Gifu, Gifu|Gifu]]</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1564, Nobunaga had his sister, [[Oichi]], marry [[Azai Nagamasa]], a daimyo in northern [[Ōmi Province]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This would later help pave the way to Kyoto</span>
				<span class='text'>==Campaign in Kyoto===In 1568, [[Ashikaga Yoshiaki]] went to Gifu to ask Nobunaga to start a campaign toward Kyoto</span>
				<span class='text'>Yoshiaki was the brother of the murdered thirteenth shogun of the Ashikaga shogunate, [[Ashikaga Yoshiteru|Yoshiteru]], and wanted revenge against the killers who had already set up a puppet shogun, [[Ashikaga Yoshihide]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Nobunaga agreed to install Yoshiaki as the new shogun and, grasping the opportunity to enter Kyoto, started his campaign</span>
				<span class='text'>An obstacle in southern Ōmi Province, however, was the [[Rokkaku clan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Led by Rokkaku Yoshikata, the clan refused to recognize Yoshiaki as shogun and was ready to go to war</span>
				<span class='text'>In response, Nobunaga launched a rapid attack, driving the Rokkaku clan out of their castles</span>
				<span class='text'>ithin a short amount of time, Nobunaga had reached Kyoto and driven the [[Miyoshi clan]] out of the city</span>
				<span class='text'>Yoshiaki was made the 15th shogun of the Ashikaga shogunate</span>

				<span class='text'>Yoshiaki, however, was not pleased about being a puppet and secretly corresponded with various daimyo, forging an anti-Nobunaga alliance</span>
				<span class='text'>=Campaign against Rival Daimyo=====Battle of Anegawa==={{Main|Battle of Anegawa}}The Asakura clan was particularly disdainful of the Oda clan's increasing power because, historically, the Oda clan had been subordinate to the Asakura clan</span>
				<span class='text'>Furthermore, [[Asakura Yoshikage]] had also protected Ashikaga Yoshiaki, but had not been willing to march toward Kyoto</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, the Asakura clan also despised Nobunaga the most for his success</span>
				<span class='text'>hen Nobunaga launched a campaign into the Asakura clan's domain, Azai Nagamasa, to whom Oichi was married, broke the alliance with Oda to honor the Azai-Asakura alliance which had lasted for generations</span>
				<span class='text'>With the help of [[Ikkō-ikki|Ikko rebels]], the anti-Nobunaga alliance sprang into full force, taking a heavy toll on the Oda clan</span>
				<span class='text'>At the [[Battle of Anegawa]], Tokugawa Ieyasu joined forces with Nobunaga and defeated the combined forces of the Asakura and Azai clans</span>
				<span class='text'>he [[Enryaku-ji]] monastery on [[Mt</span>
				<span class='text'>Hiei]], with its ''[[sōhei]]'' (warrior monks) of the [[Tendai]] school who aided the anti-Nobunaga group by helping Azai-Asakura alliance, was an issue for Nobunaga since the monastery was so close to his base of power</span>
				<span class='text'>Nobunaga attacked Enryaku-ji and razed it in 1571, killing between 3,000 and 4,000 men, women and children in the process</span>
				<span class='text'>The temple was  admired as a significant cultural symbol at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>{{Citation needed|date = May 2015}}===Siege of Nagashima and Ishiyama Hongan-ji===During the siege of [[Nagashima]], Nobunaga suffered tremendous losses, including the death of a couple of his brothers, to the [[Ikkō-ikki]] resistance, a coalition of peasant farmers, monks, [[Shinto]] priests, and local nobles that opposed samurai rule</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Siege of Nagashima|The siege]] finally ended when Nobunaga surrounded the enemy complex and set fire to it, killing tens of thousands of non-combatants, including women and children</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=October 2015}} He later succeeded in taking their main stronghold at [[Ishiyama Hongan-ji]] after an 11-year siege that ended with its surrender</span>
				<span class='text'>==Battle of Nagashino==={{Main|Battle of Nagashino}}One of the strongest rulers in the anti-Nobunaga alliance was [[Takeda Shingen]], in spite of his generally peaceful relationship and a nominal alliance with the Oda clan</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1572, at the urgings of the shogun, Shingen decided to make a drive for the capital starting with invading Tokugawa territory</span>
				<span class='text'>Tied down on the Western front, Nobunaga sent lackluster aid to Ieyasu, who suffered defeat at the [[Battle of Mikatagahara]] in 1573</span>
				<span class='text'>However, after the battle, Tokugawa's forces launched night raids and convinced Takeda of an imminent counter-attack, thus saving the vulnerable Tokugawa with the bluff</span>
				<span class='text'>This would play a pivotal role in Tokugawa's philosophy of strategic patience in his campaigns with Oda Nobunaga</span>
				<span class='text'>Shortly thereafter, the Takeda forces retreated after Shingen died of illness in 1573</span>
				<span class='text'>This was a relief for Nobunaga because he could now focus on Yoshiaki, who had openly declared hostility more than once, despite the imperial court's intervention</span>
				<span class='text'>Nobunaga was able to defeat Yoshiaki's forces and send him into exile, bringing the Ashikaga shogunate to an end in the same year</span>
				<span class='text'>lso in 1573, Nobunaga successfully destroyed the Asakura and Azai clans, leading Azai Nagamasa to send Oichi back to Nobunaga and commit suicide</span>
				<span class='text'>With Nagashima's destruction in 1574, the only threat to Nobunaga was the [[Takeda clan]], now led by [[Takeda Katsuyori]]</span>
				<span class='text'>t the decisive [[Battle of Nagashino]], the combined forces of Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu devastated the Takeda clan with the strategic use of [[arquebuse]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>Nobunaga compensated for the arquebus' slow reloading time by arranging the arquebusiers in three lines</span>
				<span class='text'>After each line fired, it would duck and reload as the next line fired</span>
				<span class='text'>The bullets were able to pierce the Takeda cavalry armor, who were pushed back and killed by incoming fire</span>
				<span class='text'>From there, Nobunaga continued his expansion, sending [[Shibata Katsuie]] and [[Maeda Toshiie]] to the north and [[Akechi Mitsuhide]] to [[Tamba Province]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==Surrender of Ishiyama Hongan-ji===In 1574 Nobunaga accepted the title of ''[[kuge]]'' (court noble), then in 1577 he was given the title of Minister of the Right (''Udaijin''), the third highest position in the Imperial court</span>

				<span class='text'>As a result, in 1577, Hashiba Hideyoshi was ordered to expand west to confront the Mori clan</span>

				<span class='text'>Following his conquest of neighboring forces, the two sides clashed during the [[Battle of Tedorigawa]] which resulted in a decisive Uesugi victory</span>
				<span class='text'>It was around this time that Uesugi forces began preparations to march on Kyoto</span>
				<span class='text'>ue to his defeat, Nobunaga's expansion in Noto, Kaga, and Etchū Province area stagnated</span>
				<span class='text'>But Kenshin, who prepared to move his armies again after the battle, died from a possible cerebral hemorrhage before moving them</span>

				<span class='text'>Led by [[Mōri Terumoto]], reinforcements arrived outside Takamatsu Castle, and the two sides came to a standstill</span>
				<span class='text'>Hideyoshi asked for reinforcements from Nobunaga</span>
				<span class='text'>t has often been argued that Hideyoshi had no need for reinforcements, but asked Nobunaga anyway for various reasons</span>
				<span class='text'>Most believe that Hideyoshi, envied and hated by fellow generals for his swift rise from a lowly footman to a top general under Oda Nobunaga, wanted to give the credit for taking Takamatsu to Nobunaga so as to humble himself in front of other Oda vassals</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=June 2012}}In any case, Nobunaga ordered [[Niwa Nagahide]] to prepare for an invasion of [[Shikoku]], and [[Akechi Mitsuhide]] to assist Hideyoshi</span>
				<span class='text'>En route to [[Chūgoku region]], Nobunaga stayed at [[Honnō-ji]], a temple in Kyoto</span>

				<span class='text'>At Honnō-ji, Nobunaga's small entourage was soon overwhelmed and as the Akechi troops closed in on the burning temple where Nobunaga had been residing, he decided to commit [[seppuku]] in one of the inner rooms</span>

				<span class='text'> At Honnō-ji, only his young page, [[Mori Ranmaru]], remained at his master's side; he was still in his teens</span>
				<span class='text'>Ranmaru's loyalty and devotion to his lord were widely known and praised during the Edo period</span>
				<span class='text'>He attended to Nobunaga as he sought a moment of peace to carry out his last act, then Ranmaru likewise killed himself in the same way</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=July 2012}}The cause of Mitsuhide's &quot;betrayal&quot; is controversial</span>
				<span class='text'>It has been proposed that Mitsuhide may have heard a rumor that Nobunaga would transfer Mitsuhide's fief to the page, Mori Ranmaru, with whom Nobunaga is alleged to have been in a ritualized homosexual relationship, a form of patronage, known as ''[[shudō]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Koike |first= Togoro |title= Koshoku monogatari|year=1963|publisher=Kamakura insatsu|pages=184–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other motives include revenge for Nobunaga's numerous insults and derisive treatment of Mitsuhide, or Mitsuhide's jealousy as Nobunaga had shown greater favor toward another vassal, Hashiba Hideyoshi</span>
				<span class='text'>Another possible motive is for revenge as Akechi Mitsuhide's mother (or perhaps aunt) was killed because Nobunaga had gone against a peace treaty that he had previously agreed to</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1579, Nobunaga captured Yakami Castle from Hatano Hideharu by promising Hideharu peace terms</span>
				<span class='text'>This accomplished Mitsuhide's goal, although Nobunaga betrayed the peace agreement and had Hideharu executed</span>
				<span class='text'>According to several stories, this displeased the Hatano family, and a short while later several of Hideharu's retainers murdered Akechi Mitsuhide's mother (or aunt)</span>
				<span class='text'>The situation was fueled through several public insults Nobunaga had directed at Mitsuhide that even drew the attention of some Western observers</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Mitsuhide's actual motive for attacking Nobunaga at Honnō-ji is not known</span>
				<span class='text'>ust eleven days after the coup at Honnō temple, Mitsuhide was killed at the [[Battle of Yamazaki]] and his army was defeated by Hashiba Hideyoshi, who eventually became heir to Nobunaga's legacy</span>
				<span class='text'>He is more widely known as Toyotomi Hideyoshi</span>
				<span class='text'>At the time of Nobunaga's death, he was in control of more than half of the provinces in Japan, the majority of which were in the Kyoto region</span>
				<span class='text'>=Nobunaga, Hideyoshi, and Ieyasu==Hideyoshi was brought up from a nameless peasant to be one of Nobunaga's top generals</span>
				<span class='text'>When he became a grand minister in 1586, he created a law that the [[samurai]] caste became codified as permanent and heritable, and that non-samurai were forbidden to carry weapons, thereby ending the social mobility of Japan from which he himself had benefited</span>
				<span class='text'>He was even said to divert rivers to flood enemy villages and clans</span>
				<span class='text'>These restrictions lasted until the dissolution of the [[Edo Shogunate]] by the [[Meiji Restoration]] revolutionaries</span>
				<span class='text'>Hideyoshi secured his claim as the rightful successor of Nobunaga by defeating Akechi Mitsuhide within a month of Nobunaga's death</span>
				<span class='text'>t is important to note that the distinction between samurai and non-samurai was so obscure that during the 16th century, most male adults in any social class (even small farmers) belonged to at least one military organization of their own and served in wars before and during Hideyoshi's rule</span>
				<span class='text'>It can be said that an &quot;all against all&quot; situation continued for a century</span>
				<span class='text'>The authorized samurai families after the 17th century were those that chose to follow Nobunaga, Hideyoshi and Ieyasu</span>
				<span class='text'>Large battles occurred during the change between regimes and a number of defeated samurai were destroyed, became [[ronin]] or were absorbed into the general populace</span>
				<span class='text'>eyasu had shared his childhood with Nobunaga as a hostage of the Oda clan</span>
				<span class='text'>Though there were a number of battles between him and the Oda clan, Ieyasu eventually switched sides and became one of Nobunaga's strongest allies</span>
				<span class='text'>=Policies==Militarily, Nobunaga changed the way war was fought in Japan</span>
				<span class='text'>He developed, implemented, and expanded the use of long [[Pike (weapon)|pike]]s, [[firearm]]s and [[castle]] fortifications in accordance with the expanded mass battles of the period</span>
				<span class='text'>The firearms that were introduced by the Portuguese had allowed the establishment of firearm brigades in the army</span>
				<span class='text'>Once the two important musket factories in Sakai City and Omi province were conquered, it gave Nobunaga superior firepower over his enemies</span>
				<span class='text'>Nobunaga also instituted a specialized warrior class system and appointed his retainers and subjects to positions based on ability, not wholly based on name, rank, or family relationship as in prior periods</span>
				<span class='text'>Retainers were also given land on the basis of rice output, not land size</span>
				<span class='text'>Nobunaga's organizational system in particular was later used and extensively developed by his ally Tokugawa Ieyasu in the forming of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] in [[Edo]]</span>
				<span class='text'>obunaga's dominance and brilliance was not restricted to the battlefield, for he also was a keen businessman and understood the principles of [[microeconomics]] and [[macroeconomic]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>First, in order to modernize the economy from an agricultural base to a manufacture and service base, castle towns were developed as the center and basis of local economies</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}  Roads were also made within his domain between castle towns to not only facilitate [[trade]], but also to move armies great distances in short timespans</span>
				<span class='text'>[[International trade]] was also expanded beyond China and the [[Korean peninsula]], while ''[[Nanban trade|nanban]]'' (southern barbarian) trade with Europe, the Philippines, [[Thailand|Siam]], and Indonesia was also started</span>
				<span class='text'>obunaga also instituted {{nihongo|''rakuichi rakuza''|楽市楽座}} policies as a way to stimulate business and the overall economy through the use of a free market system</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;map&quot;/&gt; These policies abolished and prohibited [[Monopoly|monopolies]] and opened once closed and privileged unions, associations and [[guild]]s, which he saw as impediments to commerce</span>
				<span class='text'>Even though these policies provided a major boost to the economy, it was still heavily dependent on daimyos' support</span>
				<span class='text'>Copies of his original proclamations can be found in Entoku-ji in the city of [[Gifu, Gifu|Gifu]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He also developed [[tax exemption]]s and established laws to regulate and ease the borrowing of debt</span>
				<span class='text'>=Culture==As Nobunaga conquered Japan and amassed a great amount of wealth, he progressively supported the [[arts]] for which he always had an interest, but which he later and gradually more importantly used as a display of his power and prestige</span>
				<span class='text'>He built extensive gardens and castles which were themselves great works of art</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Azuchi Castle]] on the shores of [[Lake Biwa]] is said to have been the greatest castle in the [[history of Japan]], covered with gold and statues on the outside and decorated with standing screen, sliding door, wall, and ceiling paintings made by his subject [[Kanō Eitoku]] on the inside</span>
				<span class='text'>During this time, Nobunaga's subject and tea master [[Sen no Rikyū]] established the [[Japanese tea ceremony]] which Nobunaga popularized and used originally as a way to talk politics and business</span>
				<span class='text'>The beginnings of modern [[kabuki]] were started and later fully developed in the early [[Edo period]]</span>
				<span class='text'>dditionally, Nobunaga was very interested in European culture which was still very new to Japan</span>
				<span class='text'>He collected pieces of Western art as well as arms and armor, and he is considered to be among the first Japanese people in recorded history to wear European clothes</span>
				<span class='text'>He also became the patron of the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionaries in Japan and supported the establishment of the first Christian church in Kyoto in 1576,&lt;ref name=&quot;shun&quot;&gt;[http://www</span>
