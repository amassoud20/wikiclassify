				<span class='text'>A key figure in the 17th century [[scientific revolution]], he is best known for his [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|laws of planetary motion]], based on his works ''[[Astronomia nova]]'', ''[[Harmonices Mundi]]'', and ''[[Epitome of Copernican Astronomy]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>These works also provided one of the foundations for [[Isaac Newton]]'s theory of [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|universal gravitation]]</span>
				<span class='text'>uring his career, Kepler was a mathematics teacher at a [[seminary]] school in [[Graz]], [[Habsburg Austria|Austria]], where he became an associate of [[Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg|Prince Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Later he became an assistant to astronomer [[Tycho Brahe]], and eventually the imperial mathematician to [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Rudolf II]] and his two successors [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Matthias]] and [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was also a mathematics teacher in [[Linz]], Austria, and an adviser to [[Albrecht von Wallenstein|General Wallenstein]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Additionally, he did fundamental work in the field of [[optics]], invented an improved version of the [[refracting telescope]] (the [[Keplerian Telescope]]), and mentioned the [[Telescope|telescopic]] discoveries of his contemporary [[Galileo Galilei]]</span>
				<span class='text'>epler lived in an era when there was no clear distinction between astronomy and astrology, but there was a strong division between astronomy (a branch of [[quadrivium|mathematics]] within the [[liberal arts]]) and [[physics]] (a branch of [[natural philosophy]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Kepler also incorporated religious arguments and reasoning into his work, motivated by the religious conviction and belief that God had created the world according to an intelligible plan that is accessible through the natural light of [[reason]]</span>

				<span class='text'>if|thumb|left|250px|The [[Great Comet of 1577]], which Kepler witnessed as a child, attracted the attention of astronomers across Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>]Johannes Kepler was born on December 27, the feast day of St</span>
				<span class='text'>[[John the Evangelist]], 1571, at the [[Free Imperial City]] of [[Weil der Stadt]] (now part of the [[Stuttgart Region]] in the German state of [[Baden-Württemberg]], 30&amp;nbsp;km west of Stuttgart's center)</span>
				<span class='text'>His grandfather, Sebald Kepler, had been Lord Mayor of that town but, by the time Johannes was born, he had two brothers and one sister and the Kepler family fortune was in decline</span>
				<span class='text'>His father, Heinrich Kepler, earned a precarious living as a [[mercenary]], and he left the family when Johannes was five years old</span>
				<span class='text'>He was believed to have died in the [[Eighty Years' War]] in the Netherlands</span>
				<span class='text'>His mother [[Katharina Guldenmann]], an inn-keeper's daughter, was a [[healer (alternative medicine)|healer]] and [[herbalist]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Born prematurely, Johannes claimed to have been weak and sickly as a child</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, he often impressed travelers at his grandfather's inn with his phenomenal mathematical faculty</span>

				<span class='text'>At age six, he observed the [[Great Comet of 1577]], writing that he &quot;was taken by [his] mother to a high place to look at it</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name = Koestler234/&gt; At age nine, he observed another astronomical event, a [[lunar eclipse]] in 1580, recording that he remembered being &quot;called outdoors&quot; to see it and that the [[moon]] &quot;appeared quite red&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Despite his desire to become a minister, near the end of his studies Kepler was recommended for a position as teacher of mathematics and astronomy at the Protestant school in Graz</span>
				<span class='text'>He accepted the position in April 1594, at the age of 23</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;== Graz (1594–1600) ===== ''Mysterium Cosmographicum'' ===[[Image:Kepler-solar-system-1</span>
				<span class='text'>ng|thumb|right|Kepler's [[Platonic solid]] model of the [[Solar system]] from ''Mysterium Cosmographicum'' (1596)]]Johannes Kepler's first major astronomical work, ''[[Mysterium Cosmographicum]]'' (''The Cosmographic Mystery''), was the first published defense of the Copernican system</span>
				<span class='text'>Kepler claimed to have had an [[epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]] on July 19, 1595, while teaching in [[Graz]], demonstrating the periodic [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|conjunction]] of [[Saturn]] and [[Jupiter]] in the [[zodiac]]: he realized that [[regular polygon]]s bound one inscribed and one circumscribed circle at definite ratios, which, he reasoned, might be the geometrical basis of the universe</span>
				<span class='text'>After failing to find a unique arrangement of polygons that fit known astronomical observations (even with extra planets added to the system), Kepler began experimenting with 3-dimensional [[polyhedron|polyhedra]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He found that each of the five [[Platonic solid]]s could be inscribed and circumscribed by spherical [[orb (astronomy)|orbs]]; nesting these solids, each encased in a sphere, within one another would produce six layers, corresponding to the six known planets—[[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Earth]], [[Mars]], Jupiter, and Saturn</span>
				<span class='text'>By ordering the solids selectively—[[octahedron]], [[icosahedron]], [[dodecahedron]], [[tetrahedron]], [[cube]]—Kepler found that the spheres could be placed at intervals corresponding to the relative sizes of each planet's path, assuming the planets circle the Sun</span>
				<span class='text'>Kepler also found a formula relating the size of each planet's orb to the length of its [[orbital period]]: from inner to outer planets, the ratio of increase in orbital period is twice the difference in orb radius</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Kepler later rejected this formula, because it was not precise enough</span>

				<span class='text'>ng|thumb|left|Close-up of inner section of the model]]As he indicated in the title, Kepler thought he had revealed God's geometrical plan for the universe</span>
				<span class='text'>Much of Kepler's enthusiasm for the Copernican system stemmed from his [[theological]] convictions about the connection between the physical and the [[Spirituality|spiritual]]; the universe itself was an image of God, with the Sun corresponding to the Father, the stellar sphere to the [[Jesus|Son]], and the intervening space between to the [[Holy Spirit]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His first manuscript of ''Mysterium'' contained an extensive chapter reconciling heliocentrism with biblical passages that seemed to support geocentrism</span>

				<span class='text'>&quot;Theological Foundations of Kepler's Astronomy,&quot; pp</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;99–103, 112–113</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;With the support of his mentor Michael Maestlin, Kepler received permission from the Tübingen university senate to publish his manuscript, pending removal of the Bible [[exegesis]] and the addition of a simpler, more understandable description of the Copernican system as well as Kepler's new ideas</span>
				<span class='text'> ''Mysterium'' was published late in 1596, and Kepler received his copies and began sending them to prominent astronomers and patrons early in 1597; it was not widely read, but it established Kepler's reputation as a highly skilled astronomer</span>
				<span class='text'>The effusive dedication, to powerful patrons as well as to the men who controlled his position in Graz, also provided a crucial doorway into the [[Patronage|patronage system]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Caspar</span>
				<span class='text'>''Kepler'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;65–71</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Though the details would be modified in light of his later work, Kepler never relinquished the Platonist polyhedral-spherist cosmology of ''Mysterium Cosmographicum''</span>
				<span class='text'>His subsequent main astronomical works were in some sense only further developments of it, concerned with finding more precise inner and outer dimensions for the spheres by calculating the eccentricities of the planetary orbits within it</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1621, Kepler published an expanded second edition of ''Mysterium'', half as long again as the first, detailing in footnotes the corrections and improvements he had achieved in the 25 years since its first publication</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Field</span>
				<span class='text'>''Kepler's Geometrical Cosmology'', Chapter IV, p 73ff</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In terms of the impact of ''Mysterium'', it can be seen as an important first step in modernizing the theory proposed by [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] in his &quot;De Revolutionibus&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Whilst Copernicus sought to advance a heliocentric system in this book, he resorted to Ptolemaic devices (viz</span>
				<span class='text'> epicycles and eccentric circles) in order to explain the change in planets' orbital speed, and also continued to use as a point of reference the center of the earth's orbit rather than that of the sun &quot;as an aid to calculation and in order not to confuse the reader by diverging too much from Ptolemy</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Modern astronomy owes much to &quot;Mysterium Cosmographicum&quot;, despite flaws in its main thesis,  &quot;since it represents the first step in cleansing the Copernican system of the remnants of the Ptolemaic theory still clinging to it</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Portraits of Kepler and his wife in oval medallions]]In December 1595, Kepler was introduced to Barbara Müller, a 23-year-old widow (twice over) with a young daughter, Regina Lorenz, and he began courting her</span>
				<span class='text'>Müller, heiress to the estates of her late husbands, was also the daughter of a successful mill owner</span>
				<span class='text'>Her father Jobst initially opposed a marriage despite Kepler's nobility; though he had inherited his grandfather's nobility, Kepler's poverty made him an unacceptable match</span>
				<span class='text'>Jobst relented after Kepler completed work on ''Mysterium'', but the engagement nearly fell apart while Kepler was away tending to the details of publication</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Protestant officials—who had helped set up the match—pressured the Müllers to honor their agreement</span>
				<span class='text'>Barbara and Johannes were married on April 27, 1597</span>

				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;71–75</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In the first years of their marriage, the Keplers had two children (Heinrich and Susanna), both of whom died in infancy</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1602, they had a daughter (Susanna); in 1604, a son (Friedrich); and in 1607, another son (Ludwig)</span>

				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|House of Johannes Kepler and Barbara Müller in Gössendorf near Graz (1597–1599)]]=== Other research ===Following the publication of ''Mysterium'' and with the blessing of the Graz school inspectors, Kepler began an ambitious program to extend and elaborate his work</span>
				<span class='text'>He planned four additional books: one on the stationary aspects of the universe (the Sun and the fixed stars); one on the planets and their motions; one on the physical nature of planets and the formation of geographical features (focused especially on Earth); and one on the effects of the heavens on the Earth, to include atmospheric optics, meteorology, and astrology</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Caspar</span>
				<span class='text'>''Kepler'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;85–86</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;He also sought the opinions of many of the astronomers to whom he had sent ''Mysterium'', among them [[Reimarus Ursus]] (Nicolaus Reimers Bär)—the imperial mathematician to [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolph II]] and a bitter rival of [[Tycho Brahe]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Ursus did not reply directly, but republished Kepler's flattering letter to pursue his priority dispute over (what is now called) the [[Tychonic system]] with Tycho</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite this black mark, Tycho also began corresponding with Kepler, starting with a harsh but legitimate critique of Kepler's system; among a host of objections, Tycho took issue with the use of inaccurate numerical data taken from Copernicus</span>
				<span class='text'>Through their letters, Tycho and Kepler discussed a broad range of astronomical problems, dwelling on lunar phenomena and Copernican theory (particularly its theological viability)</span>
				<span class='text'>But without the significantly more accurate data of Tycho's observatory, Kepler had no way to address many of these issues</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;86–89&lt;/ref&gt;Instead, he turned his attention to [[chronology]] and &quot;harmony,&quot; the [[numerology|numerological]] relationships among music, [[mathematics]] and the physical world, and their [[astrology|astrological]] consequences</span>
				<span class='text'>By assuming the Earth to possess a soul (a property he would later invoke to explain how the sun causes the motion of planets), he established a speculative system connecting [[astrological aspects]] and astronomical distances to [[meteorology|weather]] and other earthly phenomena</span>
				<span class='text'>By 1599, however, he again felt his work limited by the inaccuracy of available data—just as growing religious tension was also threatening his continued employment in Graz</span>
				<span class='text'>In December of that year, Tycho invited Kepler to visit him in [[Prague]]; on January 1, 1600 (before he even received the invitation), Kepler set off in the hopes that Tycho's patronage could solve his philosophical problems as well as his social and financial ones</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;89–100&lt;/ref&gt;== Prague (1600–1612) ===== Work for Tycho Brahe ===[[Image:Tycho Brahe</span>
				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|[[Tycho Brahe]]]]On February 4, 1600, Kepler met Tycho Brahe and his assistants [[Franz Tengnagel]] and [[Longomontanus]] at [[Benátky nad Jizerou]] (35&amp;nbsp;km from Prague), the site where Tycho's new observatory was being constructed</span>
				<span class='text'>Over the next two months he stayed as a guest, analyzing some of Tycho's observations of Mars; Tycho guarded his data closely, but was impressed by Kepler's theoretical ideas and soon allowed him more access</span>
				<span class='text'>Kepler planned to test his theory&lt;ref&gt;[http://knol</span>
				<span class='text'>oogle</span>
				<span class='text'>om/k/the-sky-before-the-telescope# Using Tycho's data, see 'Two views of a system' ]&lt;/ref&gt; from ''Mysterium Cosmographicum'' based on the Mars data, but he estimated that the work would take up to two years (since he was not allowed to simply copy the data for his own use)</span>
				<span class='text'>With the help of [[Johannes Jessenius]], Kepler attempted to negotiate a more formal employment arrangement with Tycho, but negotiations broke down in an angry argument and Kepler left for Prague on April 6</span>
				<span class='text'>Kepler and Tycho soon reconciled and eventually reached an agreement on salary and living arrangements, and in June, Kepler returned home to Graz to collect his family</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;100–08</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Political and religious difficulties in Graz dashed his hopes of returning immediately to Brahe; in hopes of continuing his astronomical studies, Kepler sought an appointment as mathematician to [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Ferdinand]]</span>
				<span class='text'>To that end, Kepler composed an essay—dedicated to Ferdinand—in which he proposed a force-based theory of lunar motion: &quot;In Terra inest virtus, quae Lunam ciet&quot; (&quot;There is a force in the earth which causes the moon to move&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Caspar, ''Kepler'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>110</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Though the essay did not earn him a place in Ferdinand's court, it did detail a new method for measuring lunar eclipses, which he applied during the July 10 eclipse in Graz</span>
				<span class='text'>These observations formed the basis of his explorations of the laws of optics that would culminate in ''Astronomiae Pars Optica''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;108–11</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;On August 2, 1600, after refusing to convert to Catholicism, Kepler and his family were banished from Graz</span>
				<span class='text'>Several months later, Kepler returned, now with the rest of his household, to Prague</span>
				<span class='text'>Through most of 1601, he was supported directly by Tycho, who assigned him to analyzing planetary observations and writing a tract against Tycho's (by then deceased) rival, Ursus</span>
				<span class='text'>In September, Tycho secured him a commission as a collaborator on the new project he had proposed to the emperor: the ''[[Rudolphine Tables]]'' that should replace the ''[[Prutenic Tables]]'' of [[Erasmus Reinhold]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Two days after Tycho's unexpected death on October 24, 1601, Kepler was appointed his successor as imperial mathematician with the responsibility to complete his unfinished work</span>
				<span class='text'>The next 11 years as imperial mathematician would be the most productive of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;111–22</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Kepler took [[Tycho Brahe]]'s observation logs after Tycho's death</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;The Galileo Project&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed Kepler to use them for scientific purposes, instead of letting the Brahe family lock them up, unused</span>
				<span class='text'>== Advisor to Emperor Rudolph II ===Kepler's primary obligation as imperial mathematician was to provide astrological advice to the emperor</span>
				<span class='text'>Though Kepler took a dim view of the attempts of contemporary astrologers to precisely predict the future or divine specific events, he had been casting well-received detailed horoscopes for friends, family, and patrons since his time as a student in Tübingen</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition to horoscopes for allies and foreign leaders, the emperor sought Kepler's advice in times of political trouble</span>
				<span class='text'>Rudolph was actively interested in the work of many of his court scholars (including numerous [[Alchemy|alchemists]]) and kept up with Kepler's work in physical astronomy as well</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;149–53&lt;/ref&gt;Officially, the only acceptable religious doctrines in Prague were Catholic and [[Utraquist]], but Kepler's position in the imperial court allowed him to practice his Lutheran faith unhindered</span>
				<span class='text'>The emperor nominally provided an ample income for his family, but the difficulties of the over-extended imperial treasury meant that actually getting hold of enough money to meet financial obligations was a continual struggle</span>
				<span class='text'>Partly because of financial troubles, his life at home with Barbara was unpleasant, marred with bickering and bouts of sickness</span>
				<span class='text'>Court life, however, brought Kepler into contact with other prominent scholars ([[Johannes Matthäus Wackher von Wackhenfels]], [[Jost Bürgi]], [[David Fabricius]], Martin Bachazek, and Johannes Brengger, among others) and astronomical work proceeded rapidly</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|upright|A plate from ''Astronomiae Pars Optica'', illustrating the structure of eyes]]As he slowly continued analyzing Tycho's Mars observations—now available to him in their entirety—and began the slow process of tabulating the ''Rudolphine Tables'', Kepler also picked up the investigation of the laws of optics from his lunar essay of 1600</span>
				<span class='text'>Both lunar and [[solar eclipse]]s presented unexplained phenomena, such as unexpected shadow sizes, the red color of a total lunar eclipse, and the reportedly unusual light surrounding a total solar eclipse</span>
				<span class='text'>Related issues of [[atmospheric refraction]] applied to ''all'' astronomical observations</span>
				<span class='text'>Through most of 1603, Kepler paused his other work to focus on optical theory; the resulting manuscript, presented to the emperor on January 1, 1604, was published as ''Astronomiae Pars Optica'' (''The Optical Part of Astronomy'')</span>
				<span class='text'>In it, Kepler described the [[inverse-square law]] governing the intensity of light, reflection by flat and curved mirrors, and principles of [[pinhole camera]]s, as well as the astronomical implications of optics such as [[parallax]] and the apparent sizes of heavenly bodies</span>
				<span class='text'>He also extended his study of optics to the human eye, and is generally considered by neuroscientists to be the first to recognize that images are projected inverted and reversed by the [[Lens (anatomy)|eye's lens]] onto the [[retina]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The solution to this dilemma was not of particular importance to Kepler as he did not see it as pertaining to optics, although he did suggest that the image was later corrected &quot;in the hollows of the brain&quot; due to the &quot;activity of the Soul</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Today, ''Astronomiae Pars Optica'' is generally recognized as the foundation of modern optics (though the [[law of refraction]] is conspicuously absent)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;142–146&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to the beginnings of [[projective geometry]], Kepler introduced the idea of continuous change of a mathematical entity in this work</span>
				<span class='text'>He argued that if a [[Focus (geometry)|focus]] of a [[conic section]] were allowed to move along the line joining the foci, the geometric form would morph or degenerate, one into another</span>
				<span class='text'>In this way, an [[ellipse]] becomes a [[parabola]] when a focus moves toward infinity, and when two foci of an ellipse merge into one another, a circle is formed</span>
				<span class='text'>As the foci of a hyperbola merge into one another, the hyperbola becomes a pair of straight lines</span>
				<span class='text'>He also assumed that if a straight line is extended to infinity it will meet itself at a single [[point at infinity]], thus having the properties of a large circle</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This idea was later utilized by [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[Gaspard Monge|Monge]], and [[Jean-Victor Poncelet|Poncelet]], among others, and became known as [[Smooth function#Geometric continuity|geometric continuity]] and as the [[Law of Continuity|Law or Principle of Continuity]]</span>
				<span class='text'>== The Supernova of 1604 ===[[Image:Keplers supernova</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Remnant of Kepler's Supernova [[SN 1604]]]]In October 1604, a bright new evening star ([[SN 1604]]) appeared, but Kepler did not believe the rumors until he saw it himself</span>
				<span class='text'>Kepler began systematically observing the nova</span>
				<span class='text'>Astrologically, the end of 1603 marked the beginning of a [[fiery trigon]], the start of the about 800-year cycle of [[great conjunction]]s; astrologers associated the two previous such periods with the rise of [[Charlemagne]] (c</span>
				<span class='text'>800 years earlier) and the birth of Christ (c</span>
				<span class='text'>1600 years earlier), and thus expected events of great portent, especially regarding the emperor</span>
				<span class='text'>It was in this context, as the imperial mathematician and astrologer to the emperor, that Kepler described the new star two years later in his ''De Stella Nova''</span>
				<span class='text'>In it, Kepler addressed the star's astronomical properties while taking a skeptical approach to the many astrological interpretations then circulating</span>
				<span class='text'>He noted its fading luminosity, speculated about its origin, and used the lack of observed parallax to argue that it was in the sphere of fixed stars, further undermining the doctrine of the immutability of the heavens (the idea accepted since Aristotle that the [[celestial spheres]] were perfect and unchanging)</span>
				<span class='text'>The birth of a new star implied the variability of the heavens</span>
				<span class='text'>In an appendix, Kepler also discussed the recent chronology work of the Polish historian [[Laurentius Suslyga]]; he calculated that, if Suslyga was correct that accepted timelines were four years behind, then the [[Star of Bethlehem]]—analogous to the present new star—would have coincided with the first great conjunction of the earlier 800-year cycle</span>

				<span class='text'>]=== ''Astronomia nova'' ===The extended line of research that culminated in ''[[Astronomia nova]]'' (''A New Astronomy'')—including the first two [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|laws of planetary motion]]—began with the analysis, under Tycho's direction, of Mars' orbit</span>
				<span class='text'>Kepler calculated and recalculated various approximations of Mars' orbit using an [[equant]] (the mathematical tool that Copernicus had eliminated with his system), eventually creating a model that generally agreed with Tycho's observations to within two [[arcminute]]s (the average measurement error)</span>
				<span class='text'>But he was not satisfied with the complex and still slightly inaccurate result; at certain points the model differed from the data by up to eight arcminutes</span>
				<span class='text'>The wide array of traditional mathematical astronomy methods having failed him, Kepler set about trying to fit an [[ovoid]] orbit to the data</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;123–128&lt;/ref&gt;Within Kepler's religious view of the cosmos, the Sun (a symbol of [[God the Father]]) was the source of motive force in the solar system</span>
				<span class='text'>As a physical basis, Kepler drew by analogy on [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert's]] theory of the magnetic soul of the Earth from ''[[De Magnete]]'' (1600) and on his own work on optics</span>
				<span class='text'>Kepler supposed that the motive power (or motive ''species'')&lt;ref&gt;On motive species, see: Lindberg, &quot;The Genesis of Kepler's Theory of Light,&quot; pp</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;38–40&lt;/ref&gt; radiated by the Sun weakens with distance, causing faster or slower motion as planets move closer or farther from it</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;&quot;Kepler's decision to base his causal explanation of planetary motion on a distance-velocity law, rather than on uniform circular motions of compounded spheres, marks a major shift from ancient to modern conceptions of science&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>[Kepler] had begun with physical principles and had then derived a trajectory from it, rather than simply constructing new models</span>
				<span class='text'> In other words, even  before discovering the area law, Kepler had abandoned uniform circular motion as a physical principle</span>

				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;199–202&lt;/ref&gt;  Perhaps this assumption entailed a mathematical relationship that would restore astronomical order</span>
				<span class='text'>Based on measurements of the [[aphelion]] and [[perihelion]] of the Earth and Mars, he created a formula in which a planet's rate of motion is inversely proportional to its distance from the Sun</span>
				<span class='text'>Verifying this relationship throughout the orbital cycle, however, required very extensive calculation; to simplify this task, by late 1602 Kepler reformulated the proportion in terms of geometry: ''planets sweep out equal areas in equal times''—Kepler's second law of planetary motion</span>

				<span class='text'>]He then set about calculating the entire orbit of Mars, using the geometrical rate law and assuming an egg-shaped [[ovoid]] orbit</span>
				<span class='text'>After approximately 40 failed attempts, in early 1605 he at last hit upon the idea of an ellipse, which he had previously assumed to be too simple a solution for earlier astronomers to have overlooked</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Caspar, ''Kepler'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;133&lt;/ref&gt; Finding that an elliptical orbit fit the Mars data, he immediately concluded that ''all planets move in ellipses, with the sun at one focus''—Kepler's first law of planetary motion</span>
				<span class='text'>Because he employed no calculating assistants, however, he did not extend the mathematical analysis beyond Mars</span>
				<span class='text'>By the end of the year, he completed the manuscript for ''Astronomia nova'', though it would not be published until 1609 due to legal disputes over the use of Tycho's observations, the property of his heirs</span>

				<span class='text'>He also attempted (unsuccessfully) to begin a collaboration with Italian astronomer [[Giovanni Antonio Magini]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Some of his other work dealt with chronology, especially the [[Chronology of Jesus|dating of events in the life of Jesus]], and with astrology, especially criticism of dramatic predictions of catastrophe such as those of [[Helisaeus Roeslin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;178–81&lt;/ref&gt;Kepler and Roeslin engaged in a series of published attacks and counter-attacks, while physician Philip Feselius published a work dismissing astrology altogether (and Roeslin's work in particular)</span>
				<span class='text'>In response to what Kepler saw as the excesses of astrology on the one hand and overzealous rejection of it on the other, Kepler prepared ''Tertius Interveniens'' [Third-party Interventions]</span>
				<span class='text'>Nominally this work—presented to the common patron of Roeslin and Feselius—was a neutral mediation between the feuding scholars, but it also set out Kepler's general views on the value of astrology, including some hypothesized mechanisms of interaction between planets and individual souls</span>
				<span class='text'>While Kepler considered most traditional rules and methods of astrology to be the &quot;evil-smelling dung&quot; in which &quot;an industrious hen&quot; scrapes, there was an &quot;occasional grain-seed, indeed, even a pearl or a gold nugget&quot; to be found by the conscientious scientific astrologer</span>

				<span class='text'>Upon publishing his account as ''[[Sidereus Nuncius]]'' [Starry Messenger], Galileo sought the opinion of Kepler, in part to bolster the credibility of his observations</span>
				<span class='text'>Kepler responded enthusiastically with a short published reply, ''Dissertatio cum Nuncio Sidereo'' [Conversation with the Starry Messenger]</span>
				<span class='text'>He endorsed Galileo's observations and offered a range of speculations about the meaning and implications of Galileo's discoveries and telescopic methods, for astronomy and optics as well as cosmology and astrology</span>
				<span class='text'>Later that year, Kepler published his own telescopic observations of the moons in ''Narratio de Jovis Satellitibus'', providing further support of Galileo</span>
				<span class='text'>To Kepler's disappointment, however, Galileo never published his reactions (if any) to ''Astronomia Nova''</span>

				<span class='text'>384&lt;/ref&gt;  The resulting manuscript was completed in September 1610 and published as ''Dioptrice'' in 1611</span>
				<span class='text'>In it, Kepler set out the theoretical basis of [[double-convex converging lens]]es and [[double-concave diverging lens]]es—and how they are combined to produce a [[Galilean telescope]]—as well as the concepts of [[real image|real]] vs</span>
				<span class='text'>[[virtual image|virtual]] images, upright vs</span>
				<span class='text'>inverted images, and the effects of focal length on magnification and reduction</span>
				<span class='text'>He also described an improved telescope—now known as the ''astronomical'' or ''[[Keplerian telescope]]''—in which two convex lenses can produce higher magnification than Galileo's combination of convex and concave lenses</span>

				<span class='text'>Part of the purpose of ''Somnium'' was to describe what practicing astronomy would be like from the perspective of another planet, to show the feasibility of a non-geocentric system</span>

				<span class='text'>In this treatise, he published the first description of the hexagonal symmetry of snowflakes and, extending the discussion into a hypothetical [[atomism|atomistic]] physical basis for the symmetry, posed what later became known as the [[Kepler conjecture]], a statement about the most efficient arrangement for packing spheres</span>

				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;239–240, 293–300&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1615, he completed the first of three volumes of ''Epitome astronomiae Copernicanae'' (''Epitome of Copernican Astronomy''); the first volume (books I-III) was printed in 1617, the second (book IV) in 1620, and the third (books V-VII) in 1621</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite the title, which referred simply to heliocentrism, Kepler's textbook culminated in his own ellipse-based system</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''Epitome'' became Kepler's most influential work</span>
				<span class='text'>It contained all three laws of planetary motion and attempted to explain heavenly motions through physical causes</span>

				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;302–04&lt;/ref&gt;  Though it explicitly extended the first two laws of planetary motion (applied to Mars in ''Astronomia nova'') to all the planets as well as the Moon and the [[Galilean moons|Medicean satellites of Jupiter]],&lt;ref&gt;By 1621 or earlier, Kepler recognized that Jupiter's moons obey his third law</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;br&gt;Kepler contended that rotating massive bodies communicate their rotation to their satellites, so that the satellites are swept around the central body; thus the rotation of the Sun drives the revolutions of the planets and the rotation of the Earth drives the revolution of the Moon</span>
				<span class='text'> In Kepler's era, no one had any evidence of Jupiter's rotation</span>
				<span class='text'> However, Kepler argued that the force by which a central body causes its satellites to revolve around it, weakens with distance; consequently, satellites that are farther from the central body revolve slower</span>
				<span class='text'> Kepler noted that Jupiter's moons obeyed this pattern and he inferred that a similar force was responsible</span>
				<span class='text'> He also noted that the orbital periods and semi-major axes of Jupiter's satellites were roughly related by a 3/2 power law, as are the orbits of the six (then known) planets</span>

				<span class='text'>'&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''Translation'' :  (4) However, the credibility of this [argument] is proved by the comparison of the four [moons] of Jupiter and Jupiter with the six planets and the Sun</span>
				<span class='text'> Because, regarding the body of Jupiter, whether it turns around its axis, we don't have proofs for what suffices for us [regarding the rotation of ] the body of the Earth and especially of the Sun, certainly [as reason proves to us]:  but reason attests that, just as it is clearly [true] among the six planets around the Sun, so also it is among the four [moons] of Jupiter, because around the body of Jupiter any [satellite] that can go farther from it orbits slower, and even that [orbit's period] is not in the same proportion, but greater [than the distance from Jupiter]; that is, 3/2 (''sescupla'' ) of the proportion of each of the distances from Jupiter, which is clearly the very [proportion] as [is used for] the six planets above</span>
				<span class='text'> In his [book] ''The World of Jupiter'' [''Mundus Jovialis'', 1614], [[Simon Marius|[Simon] Mayr]] [1573–1624] presents these distances, from Jupiter, of the four [moons] of Jupiter:  3, 5, 8, 13 (or 14 [according to] Galileo)&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Mayr presents their time periods:  1 day 18 1/2 hours, 3 days 13 1/3 hours, 7 days 3 hours, 16 days 18 hours:  for all [of these data] the proportion is greater than double, thus greater than [the proportion] of the distances 3, 5, 8, 13 or 14, although less than [the proportion] of the squares, which double the proportions of the distances, namely 9, 25, 64, 169 or 196, just as [a power of] 3/2 is also greater than 1 but less than 2</span>

				<span class='text'>In his calendars—six between 1617 and 1624—Kepler forecast planetary positions and weather as well as political events; the latter were often cannily accurate, thanks to his keen grasp of contemporary political and theological tensions</span>
				<span class='text'>By 1624, however, the escalation of those tensions and the ambiguity of the prophecies meant political trouble for Kepler himself; his final calendar was publicly burned in Graz</span>

				<span class='text'>The dispute escalated, and in 1617 Katharina was accused of [[European witchcraft|witchcraft]]; witchcraft trials were relatively common in central Europe at this time</span>
				<span class='text'>Beginning in August 1620, she was imprisoned for fourteen months</span>
				<span class='text'>She was released in October 1621, thanks in part to the extensive legal defense drawn up by Kepler</span>
				<span class='text'>The accusers had no stronger evidence than rumors</span>
				<span class='text'>Katharina was subjected to ''territio verbalis'', a graphic description of the torture awaiting her as a witch, in a final attempt to make her confess</span>
				<span class='text'>Throughout the trial, Kepler postponed his other work to focus on his &quot;harmonic theory&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The result, published in 1619, was ''[[Harmonices Mundi]]'' (&quot;Harmony of the World&quot;)</span>

				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;265–266, translated from ''Harmonices Mundi''&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Harmony'', he attempted to explain the proportions of the natural world—particularly the astronomical and astrological aspects—in terms of music</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;The opening of the movie ''[[Mars et Avril]]'' by [[Martin Villeneuve]] is based on German astronomer Johannes Kepler's cosmological model from the 17th century, ''[[Harmonices Mundi]]'', in which the harmony of the universe is determined by the motion of celestial bodies</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Benoît Charest]] also composed the score according to this theory</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The central set of &quot;harmonies&quot; was the ''[[musica universalis]]'' or &quot;music of the spheres&quot;, which had been studied by [[Pythagoras]], [[Ptolemy]] and many others before Kepler; in fact, soon after publishing ''Harmonices Mundi'', Kepler was embroiled in a priority dispute with [[Robert Fludd]], who had recently published his own harmonic theory</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;264–66, 290–93&lt;/ref&gt;Kepler began by exploring regular polygons and [[regular solid]]s, including the figures that would come to be known as [[Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra|Kepler's solids]]</span>
				<span class='text'>From there, he extended his harmonic analysis to music, meteorology, and astrology; harmony resulted from the tones made by the souls of heavenly bodies—and in the case of astrology, the interaction between those tones and human souls</span>
				<span class='text'>In the final portion of the work (Book V), Kepler dealt with planetary motions, especially relationships between [[orbital speed|orbital velocity]] and orbital distance from the Sun</span>
				<span class='text'>Similar relationships had been used by other astronomers, but Kepler—with Tycho's data and his own astronomical theories—treated them much more precisely and attached new physical significance to them</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;266–90&lt;/ref&gt;Among many other harmonies, Kepler articulated what came to be known as the third law of planetary motion</span>
				<span class='text'>He then tried many combinations until he discovered that (approximately) &quot;''The square of the periodic times are to each other as the cubes of the mean distances''</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Although he gives the date of this epiphany (March 8, 1618), he does not give any details about how he arrived at this conclusion</span>

				<span class='text'>When conjoined with [[Christiaan Huygens]]' newly discovered law of centrifugal force, it enabled [[Isaac Newton]], [[Edmund Halley]], and perhaps [[Christopher Wren]] and [[Robert Hooke]] to demonstrate independently that the presumed gravitational attraction between the Sun and its planets decreased with the square of the distance between them</span>

				<span class='text'>In the meantime, religious tension — the root of the ongoing [[Thirty Years' War]] — once again put Kepler and his family in jeopardy</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1625, agents of the [[Counter-Reformation|Catholic Counter-Reformation]] placed most of Kepler's library under seal, and in 1626 the city of Linz was besieged</span>
				<span class='text'>Kepler moved to [[Ulm]], where he arranged for the printing of the ''Tables'' at his own expense</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;308–328&lt;/ref&gt;In 1628, following the military successes of the Emperor Ferdinand's armies under [[Albrecht von Wallenstein|General Wallenstein]], Kepler became an official advisor to Wallenstein</span>
				<span class='text'>Though not the general's court astrologer per se, Kepler provided astronomical calculations for Wallenstein's astrologers and occasionally wrote horoscopes himself</span>
				<span class='text'>In his final years, Kepler spent much of his time traveling, from the imperial court in Prague to Linz and Ulm to a temporary home in [[Żagań|Sagan]], and finally to [[Regensburg]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon after arriving in Regensburg, Kepler fell ill</span>
				<span class='text'>He died on November 15, 1630, and was buried there; his burial site was lost after the Swedish army destroyed the churchyard</span>

				<span class='text'>Kepler and his laws of motion were central to early histories of astronomy such as [[Jean Etienne Montucla]]'s 1758 ''Histoire des mathématiques'' and [[Jean-Baptiste Delambre]]'s 1821 ''Histoire de l'astronomie moderne''</span>
				<span class='text'>These and other histories written from an [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] perspective treated Kepler's metaphysical and religious arguments with skepticism and disapproval, but later [[Romanticism in science|Romantic]]-era natural philosophers viewed these elements as central to his success</span>
				<span class='text'> [[William Whewell]], in his influential ''History of the Inductive Sciences'' of 1837, found Kepler to be the archetype of the inductive scientific genius; in his ''Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences'' of 1840, Whewell held Kepler up as the embodiment of the most advanced forms of [[scientific method]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Similarly, [[Ernst Friedrich Apelt]]—the first to extensively study Kepler's manuscripts, after their purchase by [[Catherine the Great]]—identified Kepler as a key to the &quot;[[Scientific revolution|Revolution of the sciences]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Apelt, who saw Kepler's mathematics, aesthetic sensibility, physical ideas, and theology as part of a unified system of thought, produced the first extended analysis of Kepler's life and work</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jardine, &quot;Koyré's Kepler/Kepler's Koyré,&quot; pp</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;363–367&lt;/ref&gt;[[Alexandre Koyré]]'s work on Kepler was, after Apelt, the first major milestone in historical interpretations of Kepler's cosmology and its influence</span>
				<span class='text'>In the 1930s and 1940s, Koyré, and a number of others in the first generation of professional historians of science, described the &quot;[[Scientific Revolution]]&quot; as the central event in the history of science, and Kepler as a (perhaps the) central figure in the revolution</span>
				<span class='text'>Koyré placed Kepler's theorization, rather than his empirical work, at the center of the intellectual transformation from ancient to modern world-views</span>
				<span class='text'>Since the 1960s, the volume of historical Kepler scholarship has expanded greatly, including studies of his astrology and meteorology, his geometrical methods, the role of his religious views in his work, his literary and rhetorical methods, his interaction with the broader cultural and philosophical currents of his time, and even his role as an historian of science</span>

				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;1–2&lt;/ref&gt;Philosophers of science—such as [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[Norwood Russell Hanson]], [[Stephen Toulmin]], and [[Karl Popper]]—have repeatedly turned to Kepler: examples of [[Commensurability (philosophy of science)|incommensurability]], [[analogical reasoning]], falsification, and many other philosophical concepts have been found in Kepler's work</span>
				<span class='text'>Physicist [[Wolfgang Pauli]] even used Kepler's priority dispute with Robert Fludd to explore the implications of [[analytical psychology]] on scientific investigation</span>

				<span class='text'>n edition in eight volumes, '' Kepleri Opera omnia,'' was prepared by  Christian Frisch (1807–1881), during  1858 to 1871, on the occasion of Kepler's 300th birthday</span>
				<span class='text'>risch's edition only included Kepler's Latin, with a Latin commentary</span>
				<span class='text'> new edition was planned beginning in 1914 by [[Walther von Dyck]] (1856&amp;ndash;1934)</span>
				<span class='text'>Dyck compiled copies of Kepler's unedited manuscripts, using international diplomatic contacts to convince the Soviet authorities to lend him the manuscripts kept in Leningrad for photographic reproduction</span>
				<span class='text'>These manuscripts contained several works by Kepler that had not been available to Frisch</span>
				<span class='text'>Dyck's photographs remain the basis for the modern editions of Kepler's unpublished manuscripts</span>
				<span class='text'>ax Caspar (1880&amp;ndash;1956) published his German translation of Kepler's ''Mysterium Cosmographicum'' in 1923</span>
				<span class='text'> Both Dyck and Caspar were influenced in their interest in Kepler by mathematician [[Alexander von Brill]] (1842&amp;ndash;1935)</span>
				<span class='text'>Caspar became Dyck's collaborator, succeeding him as project leader in 1934, establishing the ''Kepler-Kommission'' in the following year</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Popular science and historical fiction===Kepler has acquired a popular image as an icon of scientific modernity and a man before his time; science popularizer [[Carl Sagan]] described him as &quot;the first [[astrophysics|astrophysicist]] and the last scientific astrologer&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Quote from Carl Sagan, ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]'', episode III: &quot;The Harmony of the Worlds&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Kepler was hardly the first to combine physics and astronomy; however, according to the traditional (though disputed) interpretation of the [[Scientific Revolution]], he would be the first astrophysicist in the era of modern science</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The debate over Kepler's place in the Scientific Revolution has  produced a wide variety of philosophical and popular treatments</span>
				<span class='text'>One of the most influential is [[Arthur Koestler]]'s 1959 ''[[The Sleepwalkers]]'', in which Kepler is unambiguously the hero (morally and theologically as well as intellectually) of the revolution</span>

				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;487–489&lt;/ref&gt;=== Veneration and eponymy===In Austria, Kepler left behind such a historical legacy that he was one of the motifs of a silver collector's coin: the [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Austria)#2002 coinage|10-euro Johannes Kepler silver coin]], minted on September 10, 2002</span>
				<span class='text'>The reverse side of the coin has a portrait of Kepler, who spent some time teaching in Graz and the surrounding areas</span>
				<span class='text'>Kepler was acquainted with [[Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg|Prince Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg]] personally, and he probably influenced the construction of [[Eggenberg Castle]] (the motif of the obverse of the coin)</span>
				<span class='text'>In front of him on the coin is the model of nested spheres and polyhedra from ''Mysterium Cosmographicum''</span>
