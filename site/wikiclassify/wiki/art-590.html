				<span class='text'>Samyro'''; {{OldStyleDate|April 16|1896|April 4}} &amp;ndash; December 25, 1963) was a Romanian and French [[avant-garde]] poet, essayist and [[performance art]]ist</span>
				<span class='text'>Also active as a journalist, playwright, literary and art critic, composer and film director, he was known best for being one of the founders and central figures of the [[anti-establishment]] [[Dada]] movement</span>
				<span class='text'>Under the influence of [[Adrian Maniu]], the adolescent Tzara became interested in [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and co-founded the magazine ''[[Simbolul]]'' with [[Ion Vinea]] (with whom he also wrote [[Experimental literature|experimental]] poetry) and painter [[Marcel Janco]]</span>
				<span class='text'>During [[World War I]], after briefly collaborating on Vinea's ''[[Chemarea]]'', he joined Janco in Switzerland</span>
				<span class='text'>There, Tzara's shows at the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zürich)|Cabaret Voltaire]] and [[Zünfte of Zürich|Zunfthaus zur Waag]], as well as his poetry and [[art manifesto]]s, became a main feature of early Dadaism</span>
				<span class='text'>His work represented Dada's [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] side, in contrast with the more moderate approach favored by [[Hugo Ball]]</span>
				<span class='text'>fter moving to Paris in 1919, Tzara, by then one of the &quot;presidents of Dada&quot;, joined the staff of ''[[Littérature]]'' magazine, which marked the first step in the movement's evolution toward [[Surrealism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was involved in the major polemics which led to Dada's split, defending his principles against [[André Breton]] and [[Francis Picabia]], and, in Romania, against the [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] [[modernism]] of Vinea and Janco</span>
				<span class='text'>This personal vision on art defined his Dadaist plays ''[[The Gas Heart]]'' (1921) and ''[[Handkerchief of Clouds]]'' (1924)</span>
				<span class='text'>A forerunner of [[Surrealist automatism|automatist techniques]], Tzara eventually aligned himself with Breton's Surrealism, and under its influence wrote his celebrated [[Utopian and dystopian fiction|utopian poem]] ''[[The Approximate Man]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>uring the final part of his career, Tzara combined his [[Humanism|humanist]] and [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] perspective with a [[Communism|communist]] vision, joining the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republicans]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]] and the [[French Resistance]] during [[World War II]], and serving a term in the [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Having spoken in favor of [[liberalization]] in the [[People's Republic of Hungary]] just before the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Revolution of 1956]], he distanced himself from the [[French Communist Party]], of which he was by then a member</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1960, he was among the intellectuals who protested against French actions in the [[Algerian War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ristan Tzara was an influential author and performer, whose contribution is credited with having created a connection from [[Cubism]] and [[Futurism]] to the [[Beat Generation]], [[Situationist International|Situationism]] and various currents in [[rock music]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;pcern109&quot;/&gt; Vinea also stated that Tzara wanted to keep ''Tristan'' as his adopted first name, and that this choice had later attracted him the &quot;infamous pun&quot; ''Triste Âne Tzara'' ([[French language|French]] for &quot;Sad Donkey Tzara&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;pcern109&quot;/&gt; This version of events is uncertain, as manuscripts show that the writer may have already been using the full name, as well as the variations ''Tristan Țara'' and ''Tr</span>

				<span class='text'>09-110&lt;/ref&gt;In 1972, art historian [[Serge Fauchereau]], based on information received from Colomba, the wife of avant-garde poet [[Ilarie Voronca]], recounted that Tzara himself had explained his chosen name was a pun in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], ''trist în țară'', meaning &quot;sad in the country&quot;; Colomba Voronca was also dismissing rumors that Tzara had selected ''Tristan'' as a tribute to poet [[Tristan Corbière]] or to [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' opera</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p</span>
				<span class='text'>86-194&lt;/ref&gt;Despite their young age, the three editors were able to attract collaborations from established [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] authors, active within [[Symbolist movement in Romania|Romania's own Symbolist movement]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Literary historian [[Paul Cernat]] sees ''Simbolul'' as a main stage in Romania's [[modernism]], and credits it with having brought about the first changes from Symbolism to the radical avant-garde</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p</span>
				<span class='text'>9-54, 397-398, 412&lt;/ref&gt; Also according to Cernat, the collaboration between Samyro, Vinea and Janco was an early instance of literature becoming &quot;an interface between arts&quot;, which had for its contemporary equivalent the collaboration between Iser and writers such as [[Ion Minulescu]] and [[Tudor Arghezi]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p</span>
				<span class='text'>7&lt;/ref&gt; Although Maniu parted with the group and sought a change in style which brought him closer to traditionalist tenets, Tzara, Janco and Vinea continued their collaboration</span>
				<span class='text'>Between 1913 and 1915, they were frequently vacationing together, either on the [[Black Sea]] coast or at the Rosenstock family property in [[Gârceni]], [[Vaslui County]]; during this time, Vinea and Samyro wrote poems with similar themes and alluding to one another</span>

				<span class='text'>In autumn 1915, as founder and editor of the short-lived journal ''[[Chemarea]]'', Vinea published two poems by his friend, the first printed works to bear the signature ''Tristan Tzara''</span>

				<span class='text'>7, 106, 108-109&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the young poet and many of his friends were adherents of an [[anti-war]] and anti-[[Nationalism|nationalist]] current, which progressively accommodated [[anti-establishment]] messages</span>

				<span class='text'>9, 100-108&lt;/ref&gt; ''Chemarea'', which was a platform for this agenda and again attracted collaborations from Chapier, may also have been financed by Tzara and Vinea</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;pcern99&quot;/&gt; According to Romanian avant-garde writer [[Claude Sernet]], the journal was &quot;totally different from everything that had been printed in Romania before that moment</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p</span>
				<span class='text'>00&lt;/ref&gt; During the period, Tzara's works were sporadically published in Hefter-Hidalgo's ''[[Versuri și Proză]]'', and, in June 1915, [[Constantin Rădulescu-Motru]]'s ''[[Noua Revistă Română]]'' published Samyro's known poem ''Verișoară, fată de pension'' (&quot;Little Cousin, Boarding School Girl&quot;)</span>

				<span class='text'>The story of its establishment was the subject of a disagreement between Tzara and his fellow writers</span>
				<span class='text'>Cernat believes that the first Dadaist performance took place as early as February, when the nineteen-year-old Tzara, wearing a [[monocle]], entered the Cabaret Voltaire stage singing sentimental melodies and handing paper wads to his &quot;scandalized spectators&quot;, leaving the stage to allow room for masked actors on [[stilts]], and returning in clown attire</span>

				<span class='text'> nor was any such site desired</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gendron, p</span>
				<span class='text'>5&lt;/ref&gt; Other opinions link Dada's beginnings with much earlier events, including the experiments of [[Alfred Jarry]], [[André Gide]], [[Christian Morgenstern]], [[Jean-Pierre Brisset]], [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Jacques Vaché]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] or [[Francis Picabia]]</span>

				<span class='text'>1, 71-72, 81-100, 168-173&lt;/ref&gt;In the first of the movement's manifestos, Ball wrote: &quot;[The booklet] is intended to present to the Public the activities and interests of the Cabaret Voltaire, which has as its sole purpose to draw attention, across the barriers of war and nationalism, to the few independent spirits who live for other ideals</span>

				<span class='text'>15-116&lt;/ref&gt; Dada manifestos, written or co-authored by Tzara, record that the name shares its form with various other terms, including a word used in the [[Kru languages]] of [[West Africa]] to designate the tail of a sacred cow; a toy and the name for &quot;mother&quot; in an unspecified [[Regional Italian|Italian dialect]]; and the double affirmative in Romanian and in various [[Slavic languages]]</span>

				<span class='text'>1-32&lt;/ref&gt;===Dadaist promoter===Before the end of the war, Tzara had assumed a position as Dada's main promoter and manager, helping the Swiss group establish branches in other European countries</span>

				<span class='text'>49-251; Londré, p</span>
				<span class='text'>96; Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>3&lt;/ref&gt; This period also saw the first conflict within the group: citing irreconcilable differences with Tzara, Ball left the group</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p</span>
				<span class='text'>15; Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>3, 59&lt;/ref&gt; With his departure, Gendron argues, Tzara was able to move Dada [[vaudeville]]-like performances into more of &quot;an incendiary and yet jocularly provocative theater</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bgend77&quot;&gt;Gendron, p</span>
				<span class='text'>7&lt;/ref&gt;He is often credited with having inspired many young modernist authors from outside Switzerland to affiliate with the group, in particular the Frenchmen [[Louis Aragon]], [[André Breton]], [[Paul Éluard]], [[Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes]] and [[Philippe Soupault]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;jycmelusine&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hrich33&quot;&gt;Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>3&lt;/ref&gt; Richter, who also came into contact with Dada at this stage in its history, notes that these intellectuals often had a &quot;very cool and distant attitude to this new movement&quot; before being approached by the Romanian author</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;hrich33&quot;/&gt; In June 1916, he began editing and managing the periodical ''Dada'' as a successor of the short-lived magazine ''Cabaret Voltaire''—Richter describes his &quot;energy, passion and talent for the job&quot;, which he claims satisfied all Dadaists</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hofman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>; Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>3&lt;/ref&gt; He was at the time the lover of [[Maja Kruscek]], who was a student of [[Rudolf Laban]]; in Richter's account, their relationship was always tottering</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>5, 69-70&lt;/ref&gt;As early as 1916, Tristan Tzara took distance from the Italian [[Futurism|Futurists]], rejecting the [[Militarism|militarist]] and proto-[[Italian fascism|fascist]] stance of their leader [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p</span>
				<span class='text'>93&lt;/ref&gt; Richter notes that, by then, Dada had replaced Futurism as the leader of modernism, while continuing to build on its influence: &quot;we had swallowed Futurism—bones, feathers and all</span>
				<span class='text'>It is true that in the process of digestion all sorts of bones and feathers had been regurgitated</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;hrich33&quot;/&gt; Despite this and the fact that Dada did not make any gains in Italy, Tzara could count poets [[Giuseppe Ungaretti]] and [[Alberto Savinio]], painters [[Gino Cantarelli]] and [[Aldo Fiozzi]], as well as a few other Italian Futurists, among the Dadaists</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>99, 201 (Haftmann, in Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>17)&lt;/ref&gt; Among the Italian authors supporting Dadaist manifestos and rallying with the Dada group was the poet, painter and in the future a fascist racial theorist [[Julius Evola]], who became a personal friend of Tzara</span>

				<span class='text'>1-13</span>
				<span class='text'>ISBN 0-7286-0255-5&lt;/ref&gt;The next year, Tzara and Ball opened the ''Galerie Dada'' permanent exhibit, through which they set contacts with the independent Italian visual artist [[Giorgio de Chirico]] and with the German [[Expressionism|Expressionist]] journal ''[[Der Sturm]]'', all of whom were described as &quot;fathers of Dada&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>9-40, 46&lt;/ref&gt; During the same months, and probably owing to Tzara's intervention, the Dada group organized a performance of ''Sphinx and Strawman'', a puppet play by the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] Expressionist [[Oskar Kokoschka]], whom he advertised as an example of &quot;Dada theater&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Grigorescu, p</span>
				<span class='text'>73-174&lt;/ref&gt; He was also in touch with ''[[Nord-Sud]]'', the magazine of French poet [[Pierre Reverdy]] (who sought to unify all avant-garde trends),&lt;ref name=&quot;jycmelusine&quot;/&gt; and contributed articles on [[African art]] to both ''Nord-Sud'' and [[Pierre Albert-Birot]]'s ''SIC'' magazine</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;hrich167&quot;&gt;Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>67&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1918, through Huelsenbeck, Zürich Dadaists established contacts with their more explicitly [[left-wing]] disciples in the German Empire—[[George Grosz]], [[John Heartfield]], [[Johannes Baader]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], [[Walter Mehring]], [[Raoul Hausmann]], [[Carl Einstein]], [[Franz Jung]], and Heartfield's brother [[Wieland Herzfelde]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hofman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>-8; Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>02-114&lt;/ref&gt; With Breton, Soupault and Aragon, Tzara traveled [[Cologne]], where he became familiarized with the elaborate [[collage]] works of Schwitters and [[Max Ernst]], which he showed to his colleagues in Switzerland</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>37, 155, 159&lt;/ref&gt; Huelsenbeck nonetheless declined to Schwitters membership in Berlin Dada</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Londré, p</span>
				<span class='text'>97; Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>37-138&lt;/ref&gt;As a result of his campaigning, Tzara created a list of so-called &quot;Dada presidents&quot;, who represented various regions of Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Hans Richter, it included, alongside Tzara himself, figures ranging from Ernst, Arp, Baader, Breton and Aragon to Kruscek, Evola, [[Rafael Lasso de la Vega]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Vicente Huidobro]], [[Francesco Meriano]] and [[Théodore Fraenkel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>01&lt;/ref&gt; Richter notes: &quot;I'm not sure if all the names who appear here would agree with the description</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>00-201&lt;/ref&gt;===End of World War I===The shows Tzara staged in Zürich often turned into scandals or riots, and he was in permanent conflict with the [[Law enforcement in Switzerland|Swiss law enforcers]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p</span>
				<span class='text'>15; Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>6, 19, 39&lt;/ref&gt; Hans Richter speaks of a &quot;pleasure of letting fly at the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]], which in Tristan Tzara took the form of coldly (or hotly) calculated insolence&quot; (''see [[Épater la bourgeoisie]]'')</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>4&lt;/ref&gt; In one instance, as part of a series of events in which Dadaists mocked established authors, Tzara and Arp falsely publicized that they were going to fight a [[duel]] in Rehalp, near Zürich, and that they were going to have the popular novelist [[Jakob Christoph Heer]] for their witness</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>6-67&lt;/ref&gt; Richter also reports that his Romanian colleague profited from Swiss neutrality to play the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] and [[Central Powers]] against each other, obtaining art works and funds from both, making use of their need to stimulate their respective [[propaganda]] efforts</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>7-48&lt;/ref&gt; While active as a promoter, Tzara also published his first volume of collected poetry, the 1918 ''Vingt-cinq poèmes'' (&quot;Twenty-five Poems&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;rcard530&quot;&gt;Cardinal, p</span>
				<span class='text'>30&lt;/ref&gt;A major event took place in autumn 1918, when [[Francis Picabia]], who was then publisher of ''[[391 (magazine)|391]]'' magazine and a distant Dada affiliate, visited Zürich and introduced his colleagues there to his [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] views on art and reason</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>0-74&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], Picabia, [[Man Ray]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]] had earlier set up their own version of Dada</span>
				<span class='text'>This circle, based in New York City, sought affiliation with Tzara's only in 1921, when they jokingly asked him to grant them permission to use &quot;Dada&quot; as their own name (to which Tzara replied: &quot;Dada belongs to everybody&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hofman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>2&lt;/ref&gt; The visit was credited by Richter with boosting the Romanian author's status, but also with making Tzara himself &quot;switch suddenly from a position of balance between art and [[anti-art]] into the [[Stratosphere|stratospheric]] regions of pure and joyful nothingness</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>1&lt;/ref&gt; The movement subsequently organized its last major Swiss show, held at the Saal zur Kaufleutern, with choreography by [[Susanne Perrottet]], [[Sophie Taeuber-Arp]], and with the participation of [[Käthe Wulff]], [[Hans Heusser]], Tzara, Hans Richter and [[Walter Serner]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>4-78&lt;/ref&gt; It was there that Serner read from his 1918 essay, whose very title advocated ''Letzte Lockerung'' (&quot;Final Dissolution&quot;): this part is believed to have caused the subsequent mêlée, during which the public attacked the performers and succeeded in interrupting, but not canceling, the show</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>8-80&lt;/ref&gt;Following the November 1918 [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|Armistice with Germany]], Dada's evolution was marked by political developments</span>
				<span class='text'>In October 1919, Tzara, Arp and [[Otto Flake]] began publishing ''[[Der Zeltweg]]'', a journal aimed at further popularizing Dada in a post-war world were the borders were again accessible</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>0&quot;&gt;Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>0&lt;/ref&gt; Richter, who admits that the magazine was &quot;rather tame&quot;, also notes that Tzara and his colleagues were dealing with the impact of [[communist revolution]]s, in particular the [[October Revolution]] and the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919|German revolts of 1918]], which &quot;had stirred men's minds, divided men's interests and diverted energies in the direction of political change</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>0&quot;/&gt; The same commentator however dismisses those accounts which, he believes, led readers to believe that ''Der Zeltweg'' was &quot;an association of revolutionary artists</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>0&quot;/&gt; According to one account rendered by historian Robert Levy, Tzara shared company with a group of Romanian [[Communism|communist]] students, and, as such, may have met with [[Ana Pauker]], who was later one of the [[Romanian Communist Party]]'s most prominent activists</span>

				<span class='text'>7</span>
				<span class='text'>ISBN 0-520-22395-0&lt;/ref&gt;Arp and Janco drifted away from the movement ca</span>
				<span class='text'>1919, when they created the [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist]]-inspired workshop ''[[Das Neue Leben]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;pcern115&quot;&gt;Cernat, p</span>
				<span class='text'>15&lt;/ref&gt; In Romania, Dada was awarded an ambiguous reception from Tzara's former associate Vinea</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he was sympathetic to its goals, treasured Hugo Ball and Hennings and promised to adapt his own writings to its requirements, Vinea cautioned Tzara and the Jancos in favor of lucidity</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p</span>
				<span class='text'>21-123, 181-183&lt;/ref&gt; When Vinea submitted his poem ''Doleanțe'' (&quot;Grievances&quot;) to be published by Tzara and his associates, he was turned down, an incident which critics attribute to a contrast between the reserved tone of the piece and the revolutionary tenets of Dada</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p</span>
				<span class='text'>23-124&lt;/ref&gt;===Paris Dada===In late 1919, Tristan Tzara left Switzerland to join Breton, Soupault and [[Claude Rivière]] in editing the Paris-based magazine ''[[Littérature]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;mrdada&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cardinal, p</span>
				<span class='text'>29-530; Hofman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>2-14; Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>67, 173&lt;/ref&gt; Already a mentor for the French avant-garde, he was, according to Hans Richter, perceived as an &quot;Anti-[[Messiah]]&quot; and a &quot;prophet&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;hrich168&quot;&gt;Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>68&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, Dada mythology had it that he entered the French capital in a snow-white or lilac-colored car, passing down [[Boulevard Raspail]] through a [[triumphal arch]] made from his own pamphlets, being greeted by cheering crowds and a fireworks display</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;hrich168&quot;/&gt; Richter dismisses this account, indicating that Tzara actually walked from [[Gare de l'Est]] to Picabia's home, without anyone expecting him to arrive</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;hrich168&quot;/&gt;He is often described as the main figure in the ''Littérature'' circle, and credited with having more firmly set its artistic principles in the line of Dada</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;mrdada&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hofman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>3; Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>67&lt;/ref&gt; When Picabia began publishing a new series of ''391'' in Paris, Tzara seconded him and, Richter says, produced issues of the magazine &quot;decked out [</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> in all the colors of Dada</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;hrich167&quot;/&gt; He was also issuing his ''Dada'' magazine, printed in Paris but using the same format, renaming it ''Bulletin Dada'' and later ''Dadaphone''</span>

				<span class='text'>3-14; Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>73, 179-180&lt;/ref&gt; At around that time, he met American author [[Gertrude Stein]], who wrote about him in ''[[The Autobiography of Alice B</span>

				<span class='text'>73-176&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors who came into contact with Dada at that stage were [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Paul Dermée]] and [[Raymond Radiguet]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>73-174&lt;/ref&gt; The performances staged by Dada were often meant to popularize its principles, and Dada continued to draw attention on itself by [[hoax]]es and [[false advertising]], announcing that the [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] film star [[Charlie Chaplin]] was going to appear on stage at its show,&lt;ref name=&quot;bgend77&quot;/&gt; or that its members were going to have their heads shaved or their hair cut off on stage</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gendron, p</span>
				<span class='text'>7; Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>81&lt;/ref&gt; In another instance, Tzara and his associates lectured at the ''[[Université populaire]]'' in front of industrial workers, who were reportedly less than impressed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>75-176&quot;&gt;Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>75-176&lt;/ref&gt; Richter believes that, ideologically, Tzara was still in tribute to Picabia's nihilistic and anarchic views (which made the Dadaists attack all political and cultural ideologies), but that this also implied a measure of sympathy for the [[working class]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>75-176&quot;/&gt;Dada activities in Paris culminated in the March 1920 [[variety show]] at the [[Théâtre de l'Œuvre]], which featured readings from Breton, Picabia, Dermée and Tzara's earlier work, ''La Première aventure céleste de M</span>
				<span class='text'>Antipyrine'' (&quot;The First Heavenly Adventure of Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Antipyrine&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Londré, p</span>
				<span class='text'>98; Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>79-183&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara's melody, ''Vaseline symphonique'' (&quot;Symphonic Vaseline&quot;), which required ten or twenty people to shout &quot;cra&quot; and &quot;cri&quot; on a rising scale, was also performed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gendron, p</span>
				<span class='text'>7; Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>82&lt;/ref&gt; A scandal erupted when Breton read Picabia's ''Manifeste cannibale'' (&quot;Cannibal Manifesto&quot;), lashing out at the audience and mocking them, to which they answered by aiming rotten fruit at the stage</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>80-182&lt;/ref&gt;The Dada phenomenon was only noticed in Romania beginning in 1920, and its overall reception was negative</span>
				<span class='text'>Traditionalist historian [[Nicolae Iorga]], Symbolist promoter [[Ovid Densusianu]], the more reserved modernists [[Camil Petrescu]] and [[Benjamin Fondane]] all refused to accept it as a valid artistic manifestation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p</span>
				<span class='text'>25&lt;/ref&gt; Although he rallied with tradition, Vinea defended the subversive current in front of more serious criticism, and rejected the widespread rumor that Tzara had acted as an [[agent of influence]] for the [[Central Powers]] during the war</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p</span>
				<span class='text'>27&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eugen Lovinescu]], editor of ''[[Sburătorul]]'' and one of Vinea's rivals on the modernist scene, acknowledged the influence exercised by Tzara on the younger avant-garde authors, but analyzed his work only briefly, using as an example one of his pre-Dada poems, and depicting him as an advocate of literary &quot;extremism&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p</span>
				<span class='text'>26-127, 299&lt;/ref&gt;===Dada stagnation===[[File:St-Julien-le-Pauvre &amp; houses</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|260px|[[Saint-Julien-le-Pauvre]], site of the 1921 &quot;Dada excursion&quot;]]By 1921, Tzara had become involved in conflicts with other figures in the movement, whom he claimed had parted with the spirit of Dada</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p</span>
				<span class='text'>27-128; Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>22-123&lt;/ref&gt; He was targeted by the Berlin-based Dadaists, in particular by Huelsenbeck and Serner, the former of whom was also involved in a conflict with [[Raoul Hausmann]] over leadership status</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;hrich123&quot;/&gt; According to Richter, tensions between Breton and Tzara had surfaced in 1920, when Breton first made known his wish to do away with musical performances altogether and alleged that the Romanian was merely repeating himself</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>82-183, 192-193&lt;/ref&gt; The Dada shows themselves were by then such common occurrences that audiences expected to be insulted by the performers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;rcard530&quot;/&gt;A more serious crisis occurred in May, when Dada organized a mock trial of [[Maurice Barrès]], whose early affiliation with the Symbolists had been shadowed by his [[antisemitism]] and [[reactionary]] stance: [[Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes]] was the prosecutor, Aragon and Soupault the defense attorneys, with Tzara, Ungaretti, [[Benjamin Péret]] and others as witnesses (a [[mannequin]] stood in for Barrès)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>84-186&lt;/ref&gt; Péret immediately upset Picabia and Tzara by refusing to make the trial an absurd one, and by introducing a political subtext with which Breton nevertheless agreed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>84, 186&lt;/ref&gt; In June, Tzara and Picabia clashed with each other, after Tzara expressed an opinion that his former mentor was becoming too radical</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>84-185&lt;/ref&gt; During the same season, Breton, Arp, Ernst, [[Maja Kruschek]] and Tzara were in Austria, at [[Imst]], where they published their last manifesto as a group, ''Dada au grand air'' (&quot;Dada in the Open Air&quot;) or ''Der Sängerkrieg in Tirol'' (&quot;The Battle of the Singers in [[German Tyrol|Tyrol]]&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>86 (illustration 96)&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara also visited [[History of Czechoslovakia (1918–1938)|Czechoslovakia]], where he reportedly hoped to gain adherents to his cause</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p</span>
				<span class='text'>28&lt;/ref&gt;Also in 1921, Ion Vinea wrote an article for the Romanian newspaper ''[[Adevărul]]'', arguing that the movement had exhausted itself (although, in his letters to Tzara, he continued to ask his friend to return home and spread his message there)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p</span>
				<span class='text'>27-128&lt;/ref&gt; After July 1922, Marcel Janco rallied with Vinea in editing ''[[Contimporanul]]'', which published some of Tzara's earliest poems but never offered space to any Dadaist manifesto</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p</span>
				<span class='text'>30, 138, 153&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, the conflict between Tzara and Janco had a personal note: Janco later mentioned &quot;some dramatic quarrels&quot; between his colleague and him</span>

				<span class='text'>14&lt;/ref&gt; Basing his statement on a note supposedly authored by Huelsenbeck, Breton also accused Tzara of opportunism, claiming that he had planned wartime editions of Dada works in such a manner as not to upset actors on the political stage, making sure that German Dadaists were not made available to the public in countries subject to the [[Supreme War Council]]</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|240px|Tzara's grave in the [[Cimetière du Montparnasse]]]]In October 1956, Tzara visited the [[People's Republic of Hungary]], where the government of [[Imre Nagy]] was coming into conflict with the [[Soviet Union]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;mrnnradi&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jfapung&quot;/&gt; This followed an invitation on the part of Hungarian writer [[Gyula Illyés]], who wanted his colleague to be present at ceremonies marking the [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitation]] of [[László Rajk]] (a local communist leader whose prosecution had been ordered by [[Joseph Stalin]])</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;jfapung&quot;/&gt; Tzara was receptive of the Hungarians' demand for [[liberalization]],&lt;ref name=&quot;mrnnradi&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jfapung&quot;/&gt; contacted the anti-[[Stalinism|Stalinist]] and former Dadaist [[Lajos Kassák]], and deemed the anti-Soviet movement &quot;revolutionary&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;jfapung&quot;/&gt; However, unlike much of Hungarian public opinion, the poet did not recommend emancipation from Soviet control, and described the independence demanded by local writers as &quot;an abstract notion&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;jfapung&quot;/&gt; The statement he issued, widely quoted in the Hungarian and international press, forced a reaction from the PCF: through Aragon's reply, the party deplored the fact that one of its members was being used in support of &quot;[[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] and anti-Soviet campaigns</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;jfapung&quot;/&gt;His return to France coincided with the outbreak of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]], which ended with a Soviet military intervention</span>
				<span class='text'>On October 24, Tzara was ordered to a PCF meeting, where activist [[Laurent Casanova]] reportedly ordered him to keep silent, which Tzara did</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;jfapung&quot;/&gt; Tzara's apparent dissidence and the crisis he helped provoke within the Communist Party were celebrated by Breton, who had adopted a pro-Hungarian stance, and who defined his friend and rival as &quot;the first spokesman of the Hungarian demand</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;jfapung&quot;/&gt;He was thereafter mostly withdrawn from public life, dedicating himself to researching the work of 15th-century poet [[François Villon]],&lt;ref name=&quot;spbuot&quot;/&gt; and, like his fellow Surrealist [[Michel Leiris]], to promoting [[Primitivism|primitive]] and [[African art]], which he had been collecting for years</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;mrnnradi&quot;/&gt; In early 1957, Tzara attended a Dada retrospective on the [[Rive Gauche]], which ended in a riot caused by the rival avant-garde [[Mouvement Jariviste]], an outcome which reportedly pleased him</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;laduras&quot;/&gt;In 1961, as recognition for his work as a poet, Tzara was awarded the prestigious [[Taormina Prize]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;jycmelusine&quot;/&gt;==Literary contributions=====Identity issues===Much critical commentary about Tzara surrounds the measure to which the poet identified with the national cultures which he represented</span>
				<span class='text'>Paul Cernat notes that the association between Samyro and the Jancos, who were Jews, and their [[Romanians|ethnic Romanian]] colleagues, was one sign of a cultural dialogue, in which &quot;the openness of Romanian environments toward artistic modernity&quot; was stimulated by &quot;young emancipated Jewish writers</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p</span>
				<span class='text'>4&lt;/ref&gt; Salomon Schulman, a Swedish researcher of [[Yiddish literature]], argues that the combined influence of Yiddish folklore and [[Hasidic philosophy]] shaped European modernism in general and Tzara's style in particular,&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p</span>
				<span class='text'>5-36&lt;/ref&gt; while American poet [[Andrei Codrescu]] speaks of Tzara as one in a [[Balkans|Balkan]] line of &quot;absurdist writing&quot;, which also includes the Romanians [[Urmuz]], [[Eugène Ionesco]] and [[Emil Cioran]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Olson, p</span>
				<span class='text'>0&lt;/ref&gt; According to literary historian [[George Călinescu]], Samyro's early poems deal with &quot;the voluptuousness over the strong scents of rural life, which is typical among Jews compressed into [[ghetto]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gcal887&quot;&gt;Călinescu, p</span>
				<span class='text'>87&lt;/ref&gt;Tzara himself used elements alluding to his homeland in his early Dadaist performances</span>
				<span class='text'>His collaboration with [[Maja Kruscek]] at [[Zünfte of Zürich|Zuntfhaus zür Waag]] featured samples of [[African literature]], to which Tzara added Romanian-language fragments</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;pcern115&quot;/&gt; He is also known to have mixed elements of [[Romanian folklore]], and to have sung the native suburban [[romanza]] ''La moară la Hârța'' (&quot;At the Mill in Hârța&quot;) during at least one staging for Cabaret Voltaire</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p</span>
				<span class='text'>82, 405&lt;/ref&gt; Addressing the Romanian public in 1947, he claimed to have been captivated by &quot;the sweet language of [[Moldavia]]n peasants&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;iliv246&quot;/&gt;Tzara nonetheless rebelled against his birthplace and upbringing</span>
				<span class='text'>His earliest poems depict provincial Moldavia as a desolate and unsettling place</span>
				<span class='text'>In Cernat's view, this imagery was in common use among Moldavian-born writers who also belonged to the avant-garde trend, notably [[Benjamin Fondane]] and [[George Bacovia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p</span>
				<span class='text'>7-38&lt;/ref&gt; Like in the cases of Eugène Ionesco and Fondane, Cernat proposes, Samyro sought self-exile to [[Western Europe]] as a &quot;modern, [[Voluntarism (metaphysics)|voluntarist]]&quot; means of breaking with &quot;the peripheral condition&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p</span>
				<span class='text'>8&lt;/ref&gt; which may also serve to explain the pun he selected for a pseudonym</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;pcern110&quot;/&gt; According to the same author, two important elements in this process were &quot;a maternal attachment and a break with paternal authority&quot;, an &quot;[[Oedipus complex]]&quot; which he also argued was evident in the biographies of other Symbolist and avant-garde Romanian authors, from Urmuz to [[Mateiu Caragiale]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p</span>
				<span class='text'>8&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Vinea and the ''[[Contimporanul]]'' group, Cernat proposes, Tzara stood for radicalism and insurgency, which would also help explain their impossibility to communicate</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p</span>
				<span class='text'>98, 403-405&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Cernat argues, the writer sought to emancipate himself from competing [[nationalism]]s, and addressed himself directly to the center of European culture, with [[Zürich]] serving as a stage on his way to [[Paris]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;pcern115&quot;/&gt; The 1916 ''Monsieur's Antipyrine's Manifesto'' featured a [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] appeal: &quot;DADA remains within the framework of European weaknesses, it's still shit, but from now on we want to shit in different colors so as to adorn the zoo of art with all the flags of all the consulates</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pcern115&quot;/&gt;With time, Tristan Tzara came to be regarded by his Dada associates as an exotic character, whose attitudes were intrinsically linked with [[Eastern Europe]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Early on, Ball referred to him and the Janco brothers as &quot;Orientals&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;pcern112&quot;/&gt; [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]] believed him to be a fiery and impulsive figure, having little in common with his German collaborators</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p</span>
				<span class='text'>12; Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>8-20, 24, 36, 37, 59&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cernat, Richter's perspective seems to indicate a vision of Tzara having a &quot;[[Latin peoples|Latin]]&quot; temperament</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;pcern112&quot;/&gt; This type of perception also had negative implications for Tzara, particularly after the 1922 split within Dada</span>
				<span class='text'>In the 1940s, [[Richard Huelsenbeck]] alleged that his former colleague had always been separated from other Dadaists by his failure to appreciate the legacy of &quot;[[Humanism in Germany|German humanism]]&quot;, and that, compared to his German colleagues, he was &quot;a barbarian&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;pcern114&quot;/&gt; In his polemic with Tzara, Breton also repeatedly placed stress on his rival's foreign origin</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p</span>
				<span class='text'>14, 115; Răileanu &amp; Carassou, p</span>
				<span class='text'>5&lt;/ref&gt;At home, Tzara was occasionally targeted for his Jewishness, culminating in the ban enforced by the [[Ion Antonescu]] regime</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1931, [[Const</span>
				<span class='text'>I</span>
				<span class='text'>Emilian]], the first Romanian to write an academic study on the avant-garde, attacked him from a [[Conservatism|conservative]] and [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] position</span>
				<span class='text'>He depicted Dadaists as &quot;[[Jewish Bolshevism|Judaeo-Bolsheviks]]&quot; who corrupted [[Culture of Romania|Romanian culture]], and included Tzara among the main proponents of &quot;literary anarchism&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p</span>
				<span class='text'>96, 299, 307, 309-310, 329&lt;/ref&gt; Alleging that Tzara's only merit was to establish a literary fashion, while recognizing his &quot;formal virtuosity and artistic intelligence&quot;, he claimed to prefer Tzara in his ''[[Simbolul]]'' stage</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p</span>
				<span class='text'>10&lt;/ref&gt; This perspective was deplored early on by the modernist critic [[Perpessicius]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p</span>
				<span class='text'>29&lt;/ref&gt; Nine years after Emilian's polemic text, [[Fascism|fascist]] poet and journalist [[Radu Gyr]] published an article in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', in which he attacked Tzara as a representative of the &quot;[[Judaism|Judaic]] spirit&quot;, of the &quot;foreign plague&quot; and of &quot;[[Dialectical materialism|materialist]]-[[Historical materialism|historical dialectics]]&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;pcern49&quot;/&gt; The influence of French Symbolists on the young Samyro was particularly important, and surfaced in both his [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] and [[Prose poetry|prose poems]]</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>{{OCLC|18090790}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Belgian [[Maurice Maeterlinck]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;pcern49&quot;/&gt; Philip Beitchman argues that &quot;Tristan Tzara is one of the writers of the twentieth century who was most profoundly influenced by symbolism—and utilized many of its methods and ideas in the pursuit of his own artistic and social ends</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>7&lt;/ref&gt; However, Cernat believes, the young poet was by then already breaking with the [[syntax]] of conventional poetry, and that, in subsequent experimental pieces, he progressively stripped his style of its Symbolist elements</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p</span>
				<span class='text'>9, 52-53&lt;/ref&gt;During the 1910s, Samyro experimented with Symbolist imagery, in particular with the &quot;hanged man&quot; motif, which served as the basis for his poem ''Se spânzură un om'' (&quot;A Man Hangs Himself&quot;), and which built on the legacy of similar pieces authored by [[Christian Morgenstern]] and [[Jules Laforgue]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;pcern52&quot;&gt;Cernat, p</span>
				<span class='text'>2&lt;/ref&gt; ''Se spânzură un om'' was also in many ways similar to ones authored by his collaborators [[Adrian Maniu]] (''Balada spânzuratului'', &quot;The Hanged Man's Ballad&quot;) and Vinea (''Visul spânzuratului'', &quot;The Hanged Man's Dream&quot;): all three poets, who were all in the process of discarding Symbolism, interpreted the theme from a [[Tragicomedy|tragicomic]] and [[iconoclastic]] perspective</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;pcern52&quot;/&gt; These pieces also include ''Vacanță în provincie'' (&quot;Provincial Holiday&quot;) and the [[anti-war]] fragment ''Furtuna și cântecul dezertorului'' (&quot;The Storm and the Deserter's Song&quot;), which Vinea published in his ''Chemarea''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p</span>
				<span class='text'>7-98, 106&lt;/ref&gt; The series is seen by Cernat as &quot;the general rehearsal for the Dada adventure</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p</span>
				<span class='text'>8&lt;/ref&gt; The complete text of ''Furtuna și cântecul dezertorului'' was published at a later stage, after the missing text was discovered by Pană</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p</span>
				<span class='text'>06&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, he became interested in the [[free verse]] work of the American [[Walt Whitman]], and his translation of Whitman's [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[Song of Myself]]'', probably completed before [[World War I]], was published by [[Alfred Hefter-Hidalgo]] in his magazine ''[[Versuri și Proză]]'' (1915)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p</span>
				<span class='text'>5&lt;/ref&gt;Beitchman notes that, throughout his life, Tzara used Symbolist elements against the doctrines of Symbolism</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, he argues, the poet did not cultivate a memory of historical events, &quot;since it deludes man into thinking that there was something when there was nothing</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pbeit29&quot;&gt;Beitchman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>9&lt;/ref&gt; Cernat notes: &quot;That which essentially unifies, during [the 1910s], the poetic output of Adrian Maniu, Ion Vinea and Tristan Tzara is an acute awareness of literary conventions, a satiety [</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> in respect to [[Aestheticism|calophile]] literature, which they perceived as exhausted</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p</span>
				<span class='text'>4&lt;/ref&gt; In Beitchman's view, the revolt against cultivated beauty was a constant in Tzara's years of maturity, and his visions of social change continued to be inspired by [[Arthur Rimbaud]] and the [[Comte de Lautréamont]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>8-39, 46&lt;/ref&gt; According to Beitchman, Tzara uses the Symbolist message, &quot;the birthright [of humans] has been sold for a mess of porridge&quot;, taking it &quot;into the streets, cabarets and trains where he denounces the deal and asks for his birthright back</span>

				<span class='text'>2&lt;/ref&gt;===Collaboration with Vinea===The transition to a more radical form of poetry seems to have taken place in 1913-1915, during the periods when Tzara and Vinea were vacationing together</span>
				<span class='text'>The pieces share a number of characteristics and subjects, and the two poets even use them to allude to one another (or, in one case, to Tzara's sister)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p</span>
				<span class='text'>17, 119&lt;/ref&gt;In addition to the lyrics were they both speak of provincial holidays and love affairs with local girls, both friends intended to reinterpret [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' from a modernist perspective, and wrote incomplete texts with this as their subject</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p</span>
				<span class='text'>09, 119, 160&lt;/ref&gt; However, Paul Cernat notes, the texts also evidence a difference in approach, with Vinea's work being &quot;meditative and melancholic&quot;, while Tzara's is &quot;[[Hedonism|hedonistic]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;pcern117&quot;&gt;Cernat, p</span>
				<span class='text'>17&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara often appealed to revolutionary and ironic images, portraying provincial and [[middle class]] environments as places of artificiality and decay, demystifying [[pastoral]] themes and evidencing a will to break free</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p</span>
				<span class='text'>17-119&lt;/ref&gt; His literature took a more radical perspective on life, and featured lyrics with subversive intent:{| width=&quot;100%&quot;|- valign=&quot;top&quot; |&lt;poem&gt;să ne coborâm în râpa, care-i Dumnezeu când cască&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p</span>
				<span class='text'>19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;|&lt;poem&gt;let's descend into the precipicethat is God yawning&lt;/poem&gt;||}In his ''Înserează'' (roughly, &quot;Night Falling&quot;), probably authored in [[Mangalia]], Tzara writes:{| width=&quot;100%&quot;|- valign=&quot;top&quot; |&lt;poem&gt;[</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> deschide-te fereastră, prin urmareși ieși noapte din odaie ca din piersică sâmburul, ca preotul din biserică[</span>

				<span class='text'> let's go to the community parkbefore the rooster starts crowingso that the city will be scandalized [</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;/poem&gt;||}Vinea's similar poem, written in [[Tuzla, Constanța|Tuzla]] and named after that village, reads:{| width=&quot;100%&quot;|- valign=&quot;top&quot; |&lt;poem&gt;seara bate semne pe farpeste goarnele vagi de apăcând se întorc pescarii cu stele pe mâiniși trec vapoarele și planetele&lt;ref name=&quot;pcern117&quot;/&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;|&lt;poem&gt;the evening stamps signs on the lighthouseover the vague bugles of waterwhen fishermen return with stars on their armsand ships and planets pass by&lt;/poem&gt;||}Cernat notes that ''Nocturnă'' (&quot;Nocturne&quot;) and ''Înserează'' were the pieces originally performed at [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zürich)|Cabaret Voltaire]], identified by [[Hugo Ball]] as &quot;Rumanian poetry&quot;,&lt;!-- sic --&gt; and that they were recited in Tzara's own spontaneous French translation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p</span>

				<span class='text'>879, January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Ball's diary entry of February 5, 1916, indicates that Tzara's works were still &quot;conservative in style&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;hrich16&quot;&gt;Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>6&lt;/ref&gt; In Călinescu's view, they announce Dadaism, given that &quot;bypassing the relations which lead to a realistic vision, the poet associates unimaginably dissipated images that will surprise consciousness</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gcal887&quot;/&gt; In 1922, Tzara himself wrote: &quot;As early as 1914, I tried to strip the words of their proper meaning and use them in such a way as to give the verse a completely new, general, meaning [</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;pcern49&quot;/&gt; It opens with the lyrics:{| width=&quot;100%&quot;|- valign=&quot;top&quot; |&lt;poem&gt;Verișoară, fată de pension, îmbrăcată în negru, guler alb,Te iubesc pentru că ești simplă și viseziȘi ești bună, plângi, și rupi scrisori ce nu au înțelesȘi-ți pare rău că ești departe de ai tăi și că înveți La Călugărițe unde noaptea nu e cald</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/poem&gt;||}The [[Gârceni]] pieces were treasured by the moderate wing of the Romanian avant-garde movement</span>
				<span class='text'>In contrast to his previous rejection of Dada, ''[[Contimporanul]]'' collaborator [[Benjamin Fondane]] used them as an example of &quot;pure poetry&quot;, and compared them to the elaborate writings of French poet [[Paul Valéry]], thus recuperating them in line with the magazine's ideology</span>

				<span class='text'>2-67&lt;/ref&gt;===Dada synthesis and &quot;simultaneism&quot;===Tzara the Dadaist was inspired by the contributions of his experimental modernist predecessors</span>
				<span class='text'>Among them were the literary promoters of [[Cubism]]: in addition to [[Henri Barzun]] and [[Fernand Divoire]], Tzara cherished the works of [[Guillaume Apollinaire]]</span>

				<span class='text'>16&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Dada's condemnation of [[Futurism]], various authors note the influence [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]] and his circle exercised on Tzara's group</span>

				<span class='text'>ISBN 3-11-010555-1&lt;/ref&gt;For a large part, Dada focused on performances and [[satire]], with shows that often had Tzara, Marcel Janco and Huelsenbeck for their main protagonists</span>
				<span class='text'>Often dressed up as [[German Tyrol|Tyrolian]] peasants or wearing dark robes, they improvised poetry sessions at the Cabaret Voltaire, reciting the works of others or their spontaneous creations, which were or pretended to be in [[Esperanto]] or [[Māori language]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p</span>
				<span class='text'>13, 115&lt;/ref&gt; Bernard Gendron describes these soirées as marked by &quot;heterogeneity and [[eclecticism]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Gendron, p</span>
				<span class='text'>3&lt;/ref&gt; and Richter notes that the songs, often punctuated by loud shrieks or other unsettling sounds, built on the legacy of [[noise music]] and [[Futurism (music)|Futurist compositions]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>9&lt;/ref&gt;With time, Tristan Tzara merged his performances and his literature, taking part in developing Dada's &quot;simultaneist poetry&quot;, which was meant to be read out loud and involved a collaborative effort, being, according to [[Hans Arp]], the first instance of [[Surrealist automatism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;hrich16&quot;/&gt; Ball stated that the subject of such pieces was &quot;the value of the human voice</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>1&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Arp, Tzara and [[Walter Serner]] produced the [[German language|German-language]] ''Die Hyperbel vom Krokodilcoiffeur und dem Spazierstock'' (&quot;The Hyperbole of the Crocodile's Hairdresser and the Walking-Stick&quot;), in which, Arp stated, &quot;the poet crows, curses, sighs, stutters, [[Yodeling|yodels]], as he pleases</span>
				<span class='text'>His poems are like Nature [where] a tiny particle is as beautiful and important as a star</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>0-31&lt;/ref&gt; Another noted simultaneist poem was ''L'Amiral cherche une maison à louer'' (&quot;The Admiral Is Looking for a House to Rent&quot;), co-authored by Tzara, Marcel Janco and Huelsenbach</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;gcal887&quot;/&gt;Art historian Roger Cardinal describes Tristan Tzara's Dada poetry as marked by &quot;extreme semantic and syntactic incoherence&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;rcard530&quot;/&gt; Tzara, who recommended destroying just as it is created,&lt;ref&gt;Londré, p</span>
				<span class='text'>96-397&lt;/ref&gt; had devised a personal system for writing poetry, which implied a seemingly chaotic reassembling of words that had been randomly cut out of newspapers</span>

				<span class='text'>ISBN 0-252-01413-8&lt;/ref&gt;===Dada and anti-art===The Romanian writer also spent the Dada period issuing a long series of manifestos, which were often authored as [[prose poetry]],&lt;ref name=&quot;enotestt&quot;/&gt; and, according to Cardinal, were characterized by &quot;rumbustious tomfoolery and astringent wit&quot;, which reflected &quot;the language of a sophisticated savage&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;rcard530&quot;/&gt; Huelsenbeck credited Tzara with having discovered in them the format for &quot;compress[ing] what we think and feel&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>03&lt;/ref&gt; and, according to Hans Richter, the genre &quot;suited Tzara perfectly</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;hrich33&quot;/&gt; Despite its production of seemingly theoretical works, Richter indicates, Dada lacked any form of program, and Tzara tried to perpetuate this state of affairs</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>3-35&lt;/ref&gt; His Dada manifesto of 1918 stated: &quot;Dada means nothing&quot;, adding &quot;Thought is produced in the mouth</span>

				<span class='text'>96, 397; Richter, p</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>8, 49&lt;/ref&gt; According to Philip Beitchman, a core concept in Tzara's thought was that &quot;as long as we do things the way we think we once did them we will be unable to achieve any kind of livable society</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pbeit29&quot;/&gt;Despite adopting such [[anti-art]]istic principles, Richter argues, Tzara, like many of his fellow Dadaists, did not initially discard the mission of &quot;furthening the cause of art</span>

				<span class='text'>4&quot;&gt;Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>4&lt;/ref&gt; He saw this evident in ''La Revue Dada 2'', a poem &quot;as exquisite as freshly-picked flowers&quot;, which included the lyrics:{| width=&quot;100%&quot;|- valign=&quot;top&quot; |&lt;poem&gt;Cinq négresses dans une autoont explosé suivant les 5 directions de mes doigtsquand je pose la main sur la poitrine pour prier Dieu (parfois)autour de ma tête il y a la lumière humide des vieux oiseaux lunaires&lt;ref name=&quot;Richter, p</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Richter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>4&quot;/&gt; This sort of arrangement, treasured by many Dadaists, was probably connected with Apollinaire's [[calligram]]s, and with his announcement that &quot;Man is in search of a new language</span>

				<span class='text'>69</span>
				<span class='text'>ISBN 0-87338-419-9&lt;/ref&gt; Călinescu proposed that Tzara willingly limited the impact of chance: taking as his example a short [[parody]] piece which depicts the love affair between cyclist and a Dadaist, which ends with their decapitation by a jealous husband, the critic notes that Tzara transparently intended to &quot;shock the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;gcal887&quot;/&gt; Late in his career, Huelsenbeck alleged that Tzara never actually applied the experimental methods he had devised</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;hrich123&quot;/&gt;The Dada series makes ample use of contrast, [[Ellipse (figure of speech)|ellipses]], ridiculous imagery and nonsensical verdicts</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;enotestt&quot;/&gt; Tzara was aware that the public could find it difficult to follow his intentions, and, in a piece titled ''Le géant blanc lépreux du paysage'' (&quot;The White Leprous Giant in the Landscape&quot;) even alluded to the &quot;skinny, idiotic, dirty&quot; reader who &quot;does not understand my poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;enotestt&quot;/&gt; He called some of his own poems ''lampisteries'', from a French word designating storage areas for light fixtures</span>

				<span class='text'>30; Hofman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lettrism|Lettrist]] poet [[Isidore Isou]] included such pieces in a succession of experiments inaugurated by [[Charles Baudelaire]] with the &quot;destruction of the anecdote for the form of the poem&quot;, a process which, with Tzara, became &quot;destruction of the word for nothing&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>63</span>
				<span class='text'>ISBN 90-5183-634-1&lt;/ref&gt; According to American literary historian [[Mary Ann Caws]], Tzara's poems may be seen as having an &quot;internal order&quot;, and read as &quot;a simple spectacle, as creation complete in itself and completely obvious</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;enotestt&quot;/&gt;===Plays of the 1920s===Tristan Tzara's first play, ''[[The Gas Heart]]'', dates from the final period of Paris Dada</span>
				<span class='text'>Created with what Enoch Brater calls a &quot;peculiar verbal strategy&quot;, it is a dialogue between characters called Ear, Mouth, Eye, Nose, Neck, and Eyebrow</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ebra25&quot;&gt;Brater, p</span>
				<span class='text'>5&lt;/ref&gt; They seem unwilling to actually communicate to each other and their reliance on proverbs and idiotisms willingly creates confusion between metaphorical and literal speech</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ebra25&quot;/&gt; The play ends with a dance performance that recalls similar devices used by the proto-Dadaist [[Alfred Jarry]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The text culminates in a series of doodles and illegible words</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ebra26&quot;&gt;Brater, p</span>
				<span class='text'>6&lt;/ref&gt; Brater describes ''The Gas Heart'' as a &quot;parod[y] of theatrical conventions&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ebra26&quot;/&gt;In his 1924 play ''[[Handkerchief of Clouds]]'', Tzara explores the relation between perception, the [[subconscious]] and memory</span>
				<span class='text'>Largely through exchanges between commentators who act as third parties, the text presents the tribulations of a [[love triangle]] (a poet, a bored woman, and her banker husband, whose character traits borrow the clichés of conventional drama), and in part reproduces settings and lines from ''[[Hamlet]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>1-32&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara mocks classical theater, which demands from characters to be inspiring, believable, and to function as a whole: ''Handkerchief of Clouds'' requires actors in the role of commentators to address each other by their real names,&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>2-34; Cernat, p</span>
				<span class='text'>79&lt;/ref&gt; and their lines include dismissive comments on the play itself, while the [[protagonist]], who in the end dies, is not assigned any name</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>2-34&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''Integral'', Tzara defined his play as a note on &quot;the relativity of things, sentiments and events</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p</span>
				<span class='text'>79&lt;/ref&gt; Among the conventions ridiculed by the dramatist, Philip Beitchman notes, is that of a &quot;privileged position for art&quot;: in what Beitchman sees as a comment on [[Marxism]], poet and banker are interchangeable [[Capitalism|capitalists]] who invest in different fields</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>4-35&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1925, Fondane rendered a pronouncement by [[Jean Cocteau]], who, while commenting that Tzara was one of his &quot;most beloved&quot; writers and a &quot;great poet&quot;, argued: &quot;''Handkerchief of Clouds'' was poetry, and great poetry for that matter—but not theater</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Răileanu &amp; Carassou, p</span>
				<span class='text'>4&lt;/ref&gt; The work was nonetheless praised by [[Ion Călugăru]] at ''Integral'', who saw in it one example that modernist performance could rely not just on props, but also on a solid text</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;pcern277&quot;/&gt;===''The Approximate Man'' and later works===After 1929, with the adoption of Surrealism, Tzara's literary works discard much of their satirical purpose, and begin to explore universal themes relating to the [[human condition]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;enotestt&quot;/&gt; According to Cardinal, the period also signified the definitive move from &quot;a studied inconsequentiality&quot; and &quot;unreadable gibberish&quot; to &quot;a seductive and fertile surrealist idiom</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rcard530&quot;/&gt; The critic also remarks: &quot;Tzara arrived at a mature style of transparent simplicity, in which disparate entities could be held together in a unifying vision</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rcard530&quot;/&gt; In a 1930 essay, Fondane had given a similar verdict: arguing that Tzara had infused his work with &quot;suffering&quot;, had discovered humanity, and had become a &quot;[[Clairvoyance|clairvoyant]]&quot; among poets</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Răileanu &amp; Carassou, p</span>
				<span class='text'>5&lt;/ref&gt;This period in Tzara's creative activity centers on ''[[The Approximate Man]]'', an [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] which is reportedly recognized as his most accomplished contribution to [[French literature]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;rcard530&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;enotestt&quot;/&gt; While maintaining some of Tzara's preoccupation with language experimentation, it is mainly a study in [[social alienation]] and the search for an escape</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;enotestt&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>7-42&lt;/ref&gt; Cardinal calls the piece &quot;an extended meditation on mental and elemental impulses [</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> with images of stunning beauty&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;rcard530&quot;/&gt; while Breitchman, who notes Tzara's rebellion against the &quot;excess baggage of [man's] past and the notions [</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> with which he has hitherto tried to control his life&quot;, remarks his portrayal of poets as voices who can prevent human beings from destroying themselves with their own intellects</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>7-38&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is a new man who lets intuition and spontaneity guide him through life, and who rejects measure</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>0-45&lt;/ref&gt; One of the appeals in the text reads:{| width=&quot;100%&quot;|- valign=&quot;top&quot; |&lt;poem&gt;je parle de qui parle qui parle je suis seulje ne suis qu'un petit bruit j'ai plusieurs bruits en moiun bruit glacé froissé au carrefour jeté sur le trottoir humideaux pieds des hommes pressés courant avec leurs mortsautour de la mort qui étend ses brassur le cadran de l'heure seule vivante au soleil</span>

				<span class='text'>31&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eugène Ionesco]] argued that &quot;before Dadaism there was Urmuzianism&quot;, and, after [[World War II]], sought to popularize Urmuz's work among aficionados of Dada</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p</span>
				<span class='text'>67&lt;/ref&gt; Rumors in the literary community had it that Tzara successfully sabotaged Ionesco's initiative to publish a French edition of Urmuz's texts, allegedly because the public could then question his claim to have initiated the avant-garde experiment in Romania and the world (the edition saw print in 1965, two years after Tzara's death)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p</span>
				<span class='text'>10, 367-368&lt;/ref&gt;A more radical questioning of Tzara's influence came from Romanian essayist [[Petre Pandrea]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In his personal diary, published long after he and Tzara had died, Pandrea depicted the poet as an opportunist, accusing him of adapting his style to political requirements, of dodging military service during [[World War I]], and of being a &quot;[[Lumpenproletariat|Lumpenproletarian]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;pcern113&quot;&gt;Cernat, p</span>
				<span class='text'>13&lt;/ref&gt; Pandrea's text, completed just after Tzara's visit to Romania, claimed that his founding role within the avant-garde was an &quot;illusion [</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> which has swelled up like a multicolored balloon&quot;, and denounced him as &quot;the [[Balkans|Balkan]] provider of interlope [[odalisque]]s, [together] with narcotics and a sort of scandalous literature</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pcern113&quot;/&gt; Himself an adherent to communism, Pandrea grew disillusioned with the ideology, and later became a [[political prisoner]] in [[Communist Romania]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Vinea's own grudge probably shows up in his 1964 novel ''Lunatecii'', where Tzara is identifiable as &quot;Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Barbu&quot;, a thick-hided charlatan</span>

				<span class='text'>683, July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;From the 1960s to 1989, after a period when it ignored or attacked the avant-garde movement, the Romanian communist regime sought to recuperate Tzara, in order to validate its newly adopted emphasis on nationalist and [[National communism|national communist]] tenets</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1977, literary historian [[Edgar Papu]], whose controversial theories were linked to &quot;[[protochronism]]&quot;, which presumes that Romanians took precedence in various areas of world culture, mentioned Tzara, Urmuz, Ionesco and Isou as representatives of &quot;Romanian initiatives&quot; and &quot;road openers at a universal level</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p</span>
				<span class='text'>59&lt;/ref&gt; Elements of protochronism in this area, Paul Cernat argues, could be traced back to Vinea's claim that his friend had single-handedly created the worldwide avant-garde movement on the basis of models already present at home</span>
