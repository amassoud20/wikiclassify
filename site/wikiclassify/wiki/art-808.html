				<span class='text'>vg}}'''Barbara McClintock''' (June 16, 1902 – September 2, 1992) was an American scientist and [[cytogenetics|cytogeneticist]] who was awarded the 1983 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]]</span>
				<span class='text'>McClintock received her [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[botany]] from [[Cornell University]] in 1927</span>
				<span class='text'>There she started her career as the leader in the development of [[maize]] [[cytogenetic]]s, the focus of her research for the rest of her life</span>
				<span class='text'>From the late 1920s, McClintock studied [[chromosome]]s and how they change during reproduction in maize</span>
				<span class='text'>She developed the technique for visualizing maize chromosomes and used microscopic analysis to demonstrate many fundamental genetic ideas</span>
				<span class='text'>One of those ideas was the notion of [[genetic recombination]] by [[chromosomal crossover|crossing-over]] during [[meiosis]]—a mechanism by which chromosomes exchange information</span>
				<span class='text'>She produced the first [[genetic linkage|genetic map]] for maize, linking regions of the chromosome to physical traits</span>
				<span class='text'>She demonstrated the role of the [[telomere]] and [[centromere]], regions of the chromosome that are important in the conservation of [[genetic information]]</span>
				<span class='text'>She was recognized among the best in the field, awarded prestigious fellowships, and elected a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] in 1944</span>
				<span class='text'>uring the 1940s and 1950s, McClintock discovered [[transposon|transposition]] and used it to demonstrate that [[gene]]s are responsible for turning physical characteristics on and off</span>
				<span class='text'>She developed theories to explain the suppression and expression of genetic information from one generation of maize plants to the next</span>
				<span class='text'>Due to skepticism of her research and its implications, she stopped publishing her data in 1953</span>
				<span class='text'>ater, she made an extensive study of the cytogenetics and [[ethnobotany]] of maize [[race (biology)|race]]s from South America</span>
				<span class='text'>McClintock's research became well understood in the 1960s and 1970s, as other scientists confirmed the mechanisms of genetic change and [[regulation of gene expression|genetic regulation]] that she had demonstrated in her maize research in the 1940s and 1950s</span>
				<span class='text'>Awards and recognition for her contributions to the field followed, including the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, awarded to her in 1983 for the discovery of genetic [[transposon|transposition]]; she is the only woman to receive an unshared [[Nobel Prize]] in that category</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Kass|2003|pp=1251–1260}}During her graduate studies and postgraduate appointment as a botany instructor, McClintock was instrumental in assembling a group that studied the new field of [[cytogenetics]] in [[maize]]</span>

				<span class='text'>This particular part of her work influenced a generation of students, as it was included in most textbooks</span>
				<span class='text'>She also developed a technique using [[carmine]] staining to visualize maize chromosomes, and showed for the first time the morphology of the 10 maize chromosomes</span>
				<span class='text'>This discovery was made because she observed cells from the [[microspore]] as opposed to the [[root cap|root tip]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Kass|Bonneuil|2004|pp=91–118}}{{sfn|Fedoroff|1995|p=217}} By studying the morphology of the chromosomes, McClintock was able to [[genetic linkage|link]] specific chromosome groups of traits that were inherited together</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Fedoroff|1995|p=212}} Marcus Rhoades noted that McClintock's 1929 ''[[Genetics (journal)|Genetics]]'' paper on the characterization of [[polyploidy|triploid]] maize chromosomes triggered scientific interest in maize cytogenetics, and attributed to her 10 of the 17 significant advances in the field that were made by Cornell scientists between 1929 and 1935</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Rhoades}}In 1930, McClintock was the first person to describe the cross-shaped interaction of homologous chromosomes during [[meiosis]]</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Fedoroff|1995|p=212}}{{sfn|Coe|Kass|2005|pp=6641–6656}} They observed how the recombination of chromosomes seen under a microscope correlated with new traits</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|The Barbara McClintock Papers – Cornell}} McClintock published the first genetic map for maize in 1931, showing the order of three genes on maize chromosome 9</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|McClintock|1931|pp=485–491}}  This information provided necessary data for the crossing-over study she published with Creighton;{{sfn|Coe|Kass|2005|pp=6641–6656}} they also showed that crossing-over occurs in [[sister chromatids]] as well as [[homologous chromosomes]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Fedoroff|1995|p=218}} In 1938, she produced a cytogenetic analysis of the [[centromere]], describing the organization and function of the centromere, as well as the fact that it can divide</span>

				<span class='text'>Exposure to X-rays can increase the rate of mutation above the natural background level, making it a powerful research tool for genetics</span>
				<span class='text'>Through her work with X-ray-mutagenized maize, she identified [[ring chromosome]]s, which form when the ends of a single chromosome fuse together after radiation damage</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Fedoroff|1995|p=219}} From this evidence, McClintock hypothesized that there must be a structure on the chromosome tip that would normally ensure stability</span>
				<span class='text'>She showed that the loss of ring-chromosomes at meiosis caused [[variegation]] in maize foliage in generations subsequent to irradiation resulting from chromosomal deletion</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Fedoroff|1995|p=212}} During this period, she demonstrated the presence of the [[nucleolus organizer region]] on a region on maize chromosome 6, which is required for the assembly of the [[nucleolus]]</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|The Barbara McClintock Papers – Missouri}} In the [[anaphase]] of mitosis, the broken chromosomes formed a chromatid bridge, which was broken when the chromatids moved towards the cell poles</span>
				<span class='text'>The broken ends were rejoined in the [[interphase]] of the next mitosis, and the cycle was repeated, causing massive mutation, which she could detect as variegation in the endosperm</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|McClintock|1941|pp=234–282}} This [[Breakage-fusion-bridge cycle|breakage–rejoining–bridge cycle]] was a key cytogenetic discovery for several reasons</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|The Barbara McClintock Papers – Missouri}} First, it showed that the rejoining of chromosomes was not a random event, and second, it demonstrated a source of large-scale mutation</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Comfort|2002|p=440}} Recent evidence reveals that McClintock more likely decided to leave Missouri because she had lost trust in her employer and in the University administration, after discovering that her job would be in jeopardy if Stadler were to leave for [[Caltech]], as he had considered doing</span>
				<span class='text'>The university's retaliation against Stadler amplified her sentiments</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Kass|2003|pp=1251–1260}}In early 1941, she took a leave of absence from Missouri in hopes of finding a position elsewhere</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|McClintock|1953|pp=579–599}} She continued to investigate the problem and identified a new element that she called ''Suppressor-mutator'' (''Spm''), which, although similar to ''Ac/Ds'', acts in a more complex manner</span>
				<span class='text'>Like ''Ac/Ds'', some versions could transpose on their own and some could not; unlike ''Ac/Ds'', when present, it fully suppressed the expression of mutant genes when they normally would not be entirely suppressed</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Fedoroff|1995|p=221}} This honor allowed her to continue working with graduate students and colleagues in the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory as ''scientist emerita''; she lived in the town</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Kolata|1992}} In reference to her decision 20 years earlier to stop publishing detailed accounts of her work on controlling elements, she wrote in 1973:&lt;blockquote&gt;Over the years I have found that it is difficult if not impossible to bring to consciousness of another person the nature of his tacit assumptions when, by some special experiences, I have been made aware of them</span>
				<span class='text'>This became painfully evident to me in my attempts during the 1950s to convince geneticists that the action of genes had to be and was controlled</span>
				<span class='text'>It is now equally painful to recognize the fixity of assumptions that many persons hold on the nature of controlling elements in maize and the manners of their operation</span>
				<span class='text'>One must await the right time for conceptual change</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|McClintock|1973}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;The importance of McClintock's contributions was revealed in the 1960s, when the work of French geneticists [[Francois Jacob]] and [[Jacques Monod]] described the genetic regulation of the [[lac operon|''lac'' operon]], a concept she had demonstrated with ''Ac/Ds'' in 1951</span>
				<span class='text'>Following Jacob and Monod's 1961 ''Journal of Molecular Biology'' paper &quot;Genetic regulatory mechanisms in the synthesis of proteins&quot;, McClintock wrote an article for ''[[American Naturalist]]'' comparing the ''lac'' operon and her work on controlling elements in maize</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|McClintock|1961|pp=265–77}}{{sfn|Fedoroff|1995|p=224}} McClintock's contribution to biology is still not widely acknowledged as amounting to the discovery of genetic regulation</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Comfort|1999|pp=133–162}}McClintock was widely credited for discovering transposition after other researchers finally discovered the process in bacteria, yeast, and [[bacteriophage]]s in the late 1960s and early 1970s</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Fedoroff|1995|p=213}} During this period, molecular biology had developed significant new technology, and scientists were able to show the molecular basis for transposition</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Fedoroff|1995|p=227}} In the 1970s, ''Ac'' and ''Ds'' were [[cloning|cloned]] by other scientists and were shown to be [[transposon|Class II transposons]]</span>
				<span class='text'>''Ac'' is a complete transposon that can produce a functional [[transposase]], which is required for the element to move within the genome</span>
				<span class='text'>''Ds'' has a mutation in its transposase gene, which means that it cannot move without another source of transposase</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, as McClintock observed, ''Ds'' cannot move in the absence of ''Ac''</span>
				<span class='text'>''Spm'' has also been characterized as a transposon</span>
				<span class='text'>Subsequent research has shown that transposons typically do not move unless the cell is placed under stress, such as by irradiation or the [[breakage-fusion-bridge cycle]], and thus their activation during stress can serve as a source of genetic variation for evolution</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Pray|2008}} McClintock understood the role of transposons in evolution and genome change well before other researchers grasped the concept</span>

				<span class='text'>Comfort's biography contests some claims about McClintock, described as the &quot;McClintock Myth&quot;, which he claims was perpetuated by the earlier biography by Keller</span>
				<span class='text'>Keller's thesis was that McClintock was long ignored or met with derision because she was a woman working in the sciences</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, when McClintock presented her findings that the genetics of maize did not conform to Mendelian distributions, geneticist [[Sewall Wright]] expressed the belief that she did not understand the underlying mathematics of her work, a belief he had expressed towards other women at the time</span>

				<span class='text'>She is held up as a role model for girls in such works of children's literature as Edith Hope Fine's ''Barbara McClintock, Nobel Prize Geneticist'', Deborah Heiligman's ''Barbara McClintock: Alone in Her Field'' and Mary Kittredge's ''Barbara McClintock''</span>
