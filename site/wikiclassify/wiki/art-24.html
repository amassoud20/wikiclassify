				<span class='text'>atalogs of Vivaldi worksVivaldis works attracted cataloging efforts befitting a major composer</span>
				<span class='text'>Scholarly work intended to increase the accuracy and variety of Vivaldi performances also supported new discoveries which made old catalogs incomplete</span>
				<span class='text'>Works still in circulation today may be numbered under several different systems some earlier catalogs are mentioned </span>
				<span class='text'>ecause the simply consecutive Complete Edition CE numbers did not lect the individual works Opus numbers into which compositions were grouped Fanna numbers were often used in conjunction with CE numbers</span>
				<span class='text'>Combined Complete Edition CE Fanna numbering was especially common in the work of Italian groups driving the mid 20th century revival of Vivaldi such as Gli Accademici di Milano under Piero Santi</span>
				<span class='text'>For example the Bassoon Concerto in B major La Notte RV 501 became CE 12 F</span>
				<span class='text'>VIII1Despite the awkwardness of having to overlay Fanna numbers onto the Complete Edition number for meaningful grouping of Vivaldis oeuvre these numbers displaced the older  numbers as the re discovery of more manuscripts had rendered older catalogs obsolete</span>
				<span class='text'>his cataloging work was led by the Istituto Italiano Antonio Vivaldi where  was both the Director and the editor of the published scores Edizioni G</span>
				<span class='text'>Ricordi</span>
				<span class='text'>His work built on that of Antonio Fanna a Venetian businessman and the Institutes founder and thus formed a bridge to the scholarly catalog dominant today</span>
				<span class='text'>ompositions by Vivaldi are identified today by  the number assigned by Danish musicologist  in works published mostly in the 1970s such as the Ryom Verzeichnis or Répertoire des oeuvres dAntonio Vivaldi</span>
				<span class='text'>Like the Complete Edition before it the RV does not typically assign its single consecutive numbers to adjacent works that occupy one of the composers single opus numbers</span>
				<span class='text'>Its goal as a modern catalog is to index the manuscripts and sources that establish the existence and nature of all known works</span>
