				<span class='text'>Born in [[Venice]], he is recognized as one of the greatest Baroque composers, and his influence during his lifetime was widespread across Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>He is known mainly for composing many instrumental [[concerto]]s, for the violin and a variety of other instruments, as well as sacred choral works and more than forty [[opera]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>His best-known work is a series of [[violin concerto]]s known as ''[[The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)|The Four Seasons]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>any of his compositions were written for the female music ensemble of the ''[[Ospedale della Pietà]]'', a home for abandoned children where Vivaldi (who had been ordained as a [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Catholic priest]]) was employed from 1703 to 1715 and from 1723 to 1740</span>
				<span class='text'>Vivaldi also had some success with expensive stagings of his operas in [[Venice]], [[Mantua]] and [[Vienna]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After meeting the [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles VI]], Vivaldi moved to Vienna, hoping for preferment</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the Emperor died soon after Vivaldi's arrival, and Vivaldi himself died less than a year later in poverty</span>

				<span class='text'>He was [[Baptism|baptized]] immediately after his birth at his home by the midwife, which led to a belief that his life was somehow in danger</span>
				<span class='text'>Though not known for certain, the child's immediate baptism was most likely due either to his poor health or to an [[earthquake]] that shook the city that day</span>
				<span class='text'>In the trauma of the earthquake, Vivaldi's mother may have dedicated him to the priesthood</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Giovanni Battista, who was a barber before becoming a professional violinist, taught Antonio to play the violin and then toured Venice playing the violin with his young son</span>
				<span class='text'>Antonio was probably taught at an early age, judging by the extensive musical knowledge he had acquired by the age of 24, when he started working at the Ospedale della Pietà</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Heller, p</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The president of the ''Sovvegno'' was [[Giovanni Legrenzi]], an early Baroque composer and the ''maestro di cappella'' at [[St Mark's Basilica]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It is possible that Legrenzi gave the young Antonio his first lessons in composition</span>
				<span class='text'>The Luxembourg scholar Walter Kolneder has discerned the influence of Legrenzi's style in Vivaldi's early liturgical work ''Laetatus sum'' ([[Ryom-Verzeichnis|RV]] Anh 31), written in 1691 at the age of thirteen</span>
				<span class='text'>Vivaldi's father may have been a composer himself: in 1689, an opera titled ''La Fedeltà sfortunata'' was composed by a Giovanni Battista Rossi – the name under which Vivaldi's father had joined the Sovvegno di Santa Cecilia</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Heller, P</span>
				<span class='text'>40&lt;/ref&gt;Vivaldi's health was problematic</span>
				<span class='text'>His symptoms, ''strettezza di petto'' (&quot;tightness of the chest&quot;), have been interpreted as a form of [[asthma]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; This did not prevent him from learning to play the violin, composing or taking part in musical activities,&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; although it did stop him from playing wind instruments</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Landon, p</span>
				<span class='text'>16&lt;/ref&gt; He was ordained in 1703, aged 25, and was soon nicknamed ''il Prete Rosso'', &quot;The Red Priest&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>The German architect Johann Friedrich Armand von Uffenbach referred to Vivaldi as &quot;the famous composer and violinist&quot; and said that &quot;Vivaldi played a solo accompaniment excellently, and at the conclusion he added a free fantasy [an improvised cadenza] which absolutely astounded me, for it is hardly possible that anyone has ever played, or ever will play, in such a fashion</span>

				<span class='text'>hortly after Vivaldi's appointment, the orphans began to gain appreciation and esteem abroad, too</span>

				<span class='text'>The work seems to have been written in haste: the string parts are simple, the music of the first three movements is repeated in the next three, and not all the text is set</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, perhaps in part because of the forced essentiality of the music, the work is one of his early masterpieces</span>
				<span class='text'>espite his frequent travels from 1718, the Pietà paid him 2 [[sequin (coin)|sequins]] to write two concerti a month for the orchestra and to rehearse with them at least five times when in Venice</span>

				<span class='text'>tml Baroque Music] ''As far as his theatrical activities were concerned, the end of 1716 was a high point for Vivaldi</span>
				<span class='text'>In November, he managed to have the Ospedale della Pietà perform his first great oratorio, Juditha Triumphans devicta Holofernis barbaric</span>
				<span class='text'>{{sic}} This work was an allegorical description of the victory of the Venetians over the Turks in August 1716</span>
				<span class='text'>'&lt;/ref&gt;]]In early 18th-century Venice, opera was the most popular musical entertainment</span>
				<span class='text'>It proved most profitable for Vivaldi</span>
				<span class='text'>There were several theaters competing for the public's attention</span>
				<span class='text'>Vivaldi started his career as an opera composer as a sideline: his first opera, ''[[Ottone in villa]]'' (RV 729) was performed not in Venice, but at the Garzerie Theater in [[Vicenza]] in 1713</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Heller, p</span>
				<span class='text'>98&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Vivaldi became the [[impresario]] of the [[Teatro San Angelo]] in Venice, where his opera ''[[Orlando finto pazzo]]'' (RV 727) was performed</span>
				<span class='text'>The work was not to the public's taste, and it closed after a couple of weeks, being replaced with a repeat of a different work already given the previous year</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;In 1715, he presented ''[[Nerone fatto Cesare]]'' (RV 724, now lost), with music by seven different composers, of which he was the leader</span>
				<span class='text'>The opera contained eleven [[aria]]s, and was a success</span>
				<span class='text'>In the late season, Vivaldi planned to put on an opera composed entirely by him, ''[[Arsilda, regina di Ponto]]'' (RV 700), but the state censor blocked the performance</span>
				<span class='text'>The main character, Arsilda, falls in love with another woman, Lisea, who is pretending to be a man</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Vivaldi got the censor to accept the opera the following year, and it was a resounding success</span>
				<span class='text'>t this period, the ''Pietà'' commissioned several liturgical works</span>
				<span class='text'>The most important were two [[oratorio]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>''Moyses Deus Pharaonis'', (RV 643) is lost</span>
				<span class='text'>The second, ''[[Juditha triumphans]]'' (RV 644), celebrates the victory of the Republic of Venice against the Turks and the recapture of the island of [[Corfu]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Composed in 1716, it is one of his sacred masterpieces</span>
				<span class='text'>All eleven singing parts were performed by girls of the Pietà, both the female and male roles</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of the [[aria]]s include parts for solo instruments—recorders, oboes, violas d'amore, and mandolins—that showcased the range of talents of the girls</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Landon, p</span>
				<span class='text'>52&lt;/ref&gt;Also in 1716, Vivaldi wrote and produced two more operas, ''[[L'incoronazione di Dario]]'' (RV 719) and ''La costanza trionfante degli amori e degli odi'' (RV 706)</span>
				<span class='text'>The latter was so popular that it performed two years later, re-edited and retitled ''Artabano re dei Parti'' (RV 701, now lost)</span>
				<span class='text'>It was also performed in Prague in 1732</span>
				<span class='text'>In the following years, Vivaldi wrote several operas that were performed all over Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>is progressive operatic style caused him some trouble with more conservative musicians, like [[Benedetto Marcello]], a magistrate and amateur musician who wrote a [[pamphlet]] denouncing him and his operas</span>
				<span class='text'>The pamphlet, ''[[Il teatro alla moda]]'', attacks Vivaldi without mentioning him directly</span>
				<span class='text'>The cover drawing shows a boat (the Sant'Angelo), on the left end of which stands a little angel wearing a priest's hat and playing the violin</span>
				<span class='text'>The Marcello family claimed ownership of the Teatro Sant'Angelo, and a long legal battle had been fought with the management for its restitution, without success</span>
				<span class='text'>The obscure writing under the picture mentions non-existent places and names: ''ALDIVIVA'' is an anagram of ''A</span>
				<span class='text'>Vivaldi''</span>
				<span class='text'>n a letter written by Vivaldi to his patron Marchese Bentivoglio in 1737, he makes reference to his &quot;94 operas&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Only around 50 operas by Vivaldi have been discovered, and no other documentation of the remaining operas exists</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Vivaldi may have exaggerated, in his dual role of composer and ''impresario'' it is plausible that he may either have written or been responsible for the production of as many as 94 operas during a career which by then had spanned almost 25 years</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Heller, p</span>
				<span class='text'>97&lt;/ref&gt; While Vivaldi certainly composed many operas in his time, he never reached the prominence of other great composers like [[Alessandro Scarlatti]], [[Johann Adolph Hasse]], [[Leonardo Leo]], and [[Baldassare Galuppi]], as evidenced by his inability to keep a production running for any extended period of time in any major opera house</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Heller114&gt;Heller, p</span>
				<span class='text'>114&lt;/ref&gt;His most successful operas were ''La costanza trionfante'' and ''Farnace'' which garnered six revivals each</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1721, he was in Milan, where he presented the pastoral drama ''[[La Silvia]]'' (RV 734, 9 arias survive)</span>
				<span class='text'>He visited Milan again the following year with the oratorio ''L'adorazione delli tre re magi al bambino Gesù'' (RV 645, also lost)</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1722 he moved to Rome, where he introduced his operas' new style</span>
				<span class='text'>The new [[pope Benedict XIII]] invited Vivaldi to play for him</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1725, Vivaldi returned to Venice, where he produced four operas in the same year</span>
				<span class='text'>uring this period Vivaldi wrote the ''[[The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)|Four Seasons]]'', four violin concertos depicting scenes appropriate for each season</span>
				<span class='text'>Three of the concerti are of original conception, while the first, &quot;Spring&quot;, borrows motifs from a Sinfonia in the first act of his contemporaneous opera &quot;''Il Giustino''&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The inspiration for the concertos was probably the countryside around Mantua</span>
				<span class='text'>They were a revolution in musical conception: in them Vivaldi represented flowing creeks, singing birds (of different species, each specifically characterized), barking dogs, buzzing mosquitoes, crying shepherds, storms, drunken dancers, silent nights, hunting parties from both the hunters' and the prey's point of view, frozen landscapes, ice-skating children, and warming winter fires</span>
				<span class='text'>Each concerto is associated with a [[sonnet]], possibly by Vivaldi, describing the scenes depicted in the music</span>
				<span class='text'>They were published as the first four concertos in a collection of twelve, ''[[Il cimento dell'armonia e dell'inventione]]'', Opus 8, published in Amsterdam by [[Michel-Charles Le Cène]] in 1725</span>
				<span class='text'>uring his time in Mantua, Vivaldi became acquainted with an aspiring young singer [[Anna Girò|Anna Tessieri Girò]] who was to become his student, protégée, and favorite prima donna</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Anna, along with her older half-sister Paolina, became part of Vivaldi's entourage and regularly accompanied him on his many travels</span>
				<span class='text'>There was speculation about the nature of Vivaldi's and Giro's relationship, but no evidence to indicate anything beyond friendship and professional collaboration</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Vivaldi's relationship with Anna Girò was questioned, he adamantly denied any romantic relationship in a letter to his patron Bentivoglio dated 16 November 1737</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Later life and death===At the height of his career, Vivaldi received commissions from European nobility and royalty</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''serenata'' (cantata) ''Gloria e Imeneo'' (RV 687) was commissioned in 1725 by the French [[ambassador]] to Venice in celebration of the marriage of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The following year, another ''serenata'', ''La Sena festeggiante'' (RV 694), was written for and premiered at the French embassy as well, celebrating the birth of the French royal princesses, [[Princess Henriette of France|Henriette]] and [[Louise Élisabeth of France|Louise Élisabeth]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Vivaldi's Opus 9, ''[[La Cetra (Vivaldi)|La Cetra]]'', was dedicated to [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1728, Vivaldi met the emperor while the emperor was visiting [[Trieste]] to oversee the construction of a new port</span>
				<span class='text'>Charles admired the music of the Red Priest so much that he is said to have spoken more with the composer during their one meeting than he spoke to his ministers in over two years</span>
				<span class='text'>He gave Vivaldi the title of [[knight]], a gold medal and an invitation to Vienna</span>
				<span class='text'>Vivaldi gave Charles a manuscript copy of ''La Cetra'', a set of concerti almost completely different from the set of the same title published as Opus 9</span>
				<span class='text'>The printing was probably delayed, forcing Vivaldi to gather an improvised collection for the emperor</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Teatro alla moda</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|left|thumb|250px||Frontispiece of ''Il teatro alla moda'']]Accompanied by his father, Vivaldi traveled to Vienna and Prague in 1730, where his opera ''[[Farnace]]'' (RV 711) was presented</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Vivaldi's connections with musical life in Prague and his association with [[Antonio Denzio]], the impresario of the [[Franz Anton von Sporck|Sporck theater in Prague]] are detailed in Daniel E</span>

				<span class='text'> Pendragon Press, 1992)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Some of his later operas were created in collaboration with two of Italy's major writers of the time</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[L'Olimpiade]]'' and ''[[Catone in Utica]]'' were written by [[Pietro Metastasio]], the major representative of the [[Academy of Arcadia|Arcadian]] movement and court poet in Vienna</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[Griselda (Vivaldi)|La Griselda]]'' was rewritten by the young [[Carlo Goldoni]] from an earlier libretto by [[Apostolo Zeno]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ike many composers of the time, the final years of Vivaldi's life found him in financial difficulties</span>
				<span class='text'>His compositions were no longer held in such high esteem as they once were in Venice; changing musical tastes quickly made them outmoded</span>
				<span class='text'>In response, Vivaldi chose to sell off sizeable numbers of his manuscripts at paltry prices to finance his migration to [[Vienna]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Walter Kolneder, ''Antonio Vivaldi: Documents of his life and works'' (Amsterdam: Heinrichshofen's Verlag, Wilhelmshaven, Locarno, 1982), 179</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for Vivaldi's departure from Venice are unclear, but it seems likely that, after the success of his meeting with Emperor Charles VI, he wished to take up the position of a composer in the imperial court</span>
				<span class='text'>On his way to Vienna, Vivaldi may have stopped in Graz to see Anna Girò</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Walter Kolneder, ''Antonio Vivaldi: Documents of his life and works'' (Amsterdam: Heinrichshofen's Verlag, Wilhelmshaven, Locarno, 1982), 180</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;It is also likely that Vivaldi went to Vienna to stage operas, especially as he took up residence near the [[Kärntnertortheater]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Shortly after his arrival in Vienna, Charles VI died, which left the composer without any royal protection or a steady source of income</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon afterwards, Vivaldi became impoverished&lt;ref&gt;Landon supplies this assertion and furthermore quotes the report of Vivaldi's death which reached Venice in the ''Commemorali Gradenigo'': &quot;Abbe Lord Antonio Vivaldi, incomparable virtuoso of the violin, known as the Red Priest, much esteemed for his compositions and concertos, who earned more than 50,000 ducats in his life, but his disorderly prodigality caused him to die a pauper in Vienna</span>

				<span class='text'>On 28 July he was buried in a simple grave in a burial ground that was owned by the public hospital fund</span>

				<span class='text'>nly three portraits of Vivaldi are known to survive: an engraving, an ink sketch and an oil painting</span>
				<span class='text'>The engraving, by Francois Morellon La Cave, was made in 1725 and shows Vivaldi holding a sheet of music</span>
				<span class='text'>The ink sketch, a [[caricature]], was done by [[Pier Leone Ghezzi|Ghezzi]] in 1723 and shows Vivaldi's head and shoulders in profile</span>

				<span class='text'>}Vivaldi's music was innovative</span>
				<span class='text'>He brightened the formal and rhythmic structure of the concerto, in which he looked for harmonic contrasts and innovative melodies and themes; many of his compositions are flamboyantly, almost playfully, exuberant</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;!-- some compositions before Vivaldi were flamboyantly and playfully exuberant, what does this tell us? --&gt;[[Johann Sebastian Bach]] was deeply influenced by Vivaldi's concertos and arias (recalled in his ''[[St John Passion]]'', ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'', and [[Bach cantata|cantatas]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Bach transcribed six of Vivaldi's concerti for solo keyboard, three for organ, and one for four harpsichords, strings, and [[Figured bass|basso continuo]] (BWV 1065) based upon the concerto for four violins, two violas, cello, and basso continuo ([[Ryom-Verzeichnis|RV]] 580)</span>
				<span class='text'>=Posthumous reputation==During his lifetime, Vivaldi's popularity quickly made him famous in other countries, including France, but after his death the composer's popularity dwindled</span>
				<span class='text'>After the Baroque period, Vivaldi's published concerti became relatively unknown and were largely ignored</span>
				<span class='text'>Even Vivaldi's most famous work, ''The Four Seasons'', was unknown in its original edition during the [[Classical period (music)|Classical]] and [[Romantic music|Romantic]] periods</span>
				<span class='text'>uring the early 20th century, [[Fritz Kreisler]]'s Concerto in C, in the Style of Vivaldi (which he passed off as an original Vivaldi work) helped revive Vivaldi's reputation</span>
				<span class='text'>This spurred the French scholar [[Marc Pincherle]] to begin an academic study of Vivaldi's oeuvre</span>
				<span class='text'>Many Vivaldi manuscripts were rediscovered, which were acquired by the [[Turin National University Library]] as a result of the generous sponsorship of [[Turin]]ese businessmen Roberto Foa and Filippo Giordano, in memory of their sons</span>
				<span class='text'>This led to a renewed interest in Vivaldi by, among others, Mario Rinaldi, [[Alfredo Casella]], [[Ezra Pound]], [[Olga Rudge]], [[Desmond Chute]], [[Arturo Toscanini]], [[Arnold Schering]] and [[Louis Kaufman]], all of whom were instrumental in the Vivaldi revival of the 20th century</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1926, in a monastery in [[Piedmont]], researchers discovered fourteen folios of Vivaldi's work that were previously thought to have been lost during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Some missing volumes in the numbered set were discovered in the collections of the descendants of the Grand Duke Durazzo, who had acquired the monastery complex in the 18th century</span>
				<span class='text'>The volumes contained 300 concertos, 19 operas and over 100 vocal-instrumental works</span>

				<span class='text'>Laurent Quebec Canada&lt;/ref&gt;The resurrection of Vivaldi's unpublished works in the 20th century is mostly due to the efforts of [[Alfredo Casella]], who in 1939 organized the historic Vivaldi Week, in which the rediscovered [[Gloria (Vivaldi)|Gloria]] (RV 589) and l'Olimpiade were revived</span>
				<span class='text'>Since [[World War II]], Vivaldi's compositions have enjoyed wide success</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Historically informed performance]]s, often on &quot;original instruments&quot;, have increased Vivaldi's fame still further</span>
				<span class='text'>ecent rediscoveries of works by Vivaldi include two [[psalm]] settings of ''Nisi Dominus'' (RV 803, in eight movements) and ''Dixit Dominus'' (RV 807, in eleven movements)</span>
				<span class='text'>These were identified in 2003 and 2005 respectively, by the Australian scholar Janice Stockigt</span>
				<span class='text'>The Vivaldi scholar [[Michael Talbot (musicologist)|Michael Talbot]] described RV 807 as &quot;arguably the best nonoperatic work from Vivaldi's pen to come to light since</span>

				<span class='text'>[The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)|''Le quattro stagioni'' (The Four Seasons)]] of 1723 is his most famous work</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Vivaldi wrote more than 500 other concertos</span>
				<span class='text'>About 350 of these are for solo instrument and strings, of which 230 are for violin, the others being for [[bassoon]], [[cello]], [[oboe]], [[flute]], [[viola d'amore]], [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], [[lute]], or [[mandolin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>About forty concertos are for two instruments and strings and about thirty are for three or more instruments and strings</span>
				<span class='text'>s well as about 46 operas, Vivaldi composed a large body of sacred choral music</span>
				<span class='text'>Other works include [[sinfonia]]s, about 90 [[sonata]]s and chamber music</span>
				<span class='text'>ome sonatas for flute, published as ''Il Pastor Fido'', have been erroneously attributed to Vivaldi, but were composed by [[Nicolas Chédeville]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Catalogs of Vivaldi works==Vivaldi's works attracted cataloging efforts befitting a major composer</span>
				<span class='text'>Scholarly work intended to increase the accuracy and variety of Vivaldi performances also supported new discoveries which made old catalogs incomplete</span>
				<span class='text'>Works still in circulation today may be numbered under several different systems (some earlier catalogs are mentioned [[Ryom-Verzeichnis|here]])</span>
				<span class='text'>ecause the simply consecutive Complete Edition (CE) numbers did not reflect the individual works (Opus numbers) into which compositions were grouped, Fanna numbers were often used in conjunction with CE numbers</span>
				<span class='text'>Combined Complete Edition (CE)/Fanna numbering was especially common in the work of Italian groups driving the mid-20th century revival of Vivaldi, such as Gli Accademici di Milano under Piero Santi</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, the Bassoon Concerto in B{{music|flat}} major, &quot;La Notte&quot; RV 501, became CE 12, F</span>
				<span class='text'>VIII,1Despite the awkwardness of having to overlay Fanna numbers onto the Complete Edition number for meaningful grouping of Vivaldi's oeuvre, these numbers displaced the older [[Marc Pincherle|Pincherle]] numbers as the (re-)discovery of more manuscripts had rendered older catalogs obsolete</span>
				<span class='text'>his cataloging work was led by the Istituto Italiano Antonio Vivaldi, where [[Gian Francesco Malipiero]] was both the Director and the editor of the published scores (Edizioni G</span>
				<span class='text'>Ricordi)</span>
				<span class='text'>His work built on that of Antonio Fanna, a Venetian businessman and the Institute's founder, and thus formed a bridge to the scholarly catalog dominant today</span>
				<span class='text'>ompositions by Vivaldi are identified today by [[Ryom-Verzeichnis|RV number]], the number assigned by Danish musicologist [[Peter Ryom]] in works published mostly in the 1970s, such as the &quot;Ryom-Verzeichnis&quot; or &quot;Répertoire des oeuvres d'Antonio Vivaldi&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Like the Complete Edition before it, the RV does not typically assign its single, consecutive numbers to &quot;adjacent&quot; works that occupy one of the composer's single opus numbers</span>
				<span class='text'>Its goal as a modern catalog is to index the manuscripts and sources that establish the existence and nature of all known works</span>
