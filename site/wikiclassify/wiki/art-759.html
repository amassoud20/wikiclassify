				<span class='text'>The event took place in the [[Moravia]]n city of [[Olomouc]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Largely considered to be a [[reactionary]], Franz Joseph spent his early reign resisting [[constitutionalism]] in his domains</span>

				<span class='text'>He concluded the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867|''Ausgleich'' of 1867]], which granted greater autonomy to [[Hungary]], hence transforming the Austrian Empire into the Austro-Hungarian Empire under his [[dual monarchy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His domains were then ruled peacefully for the next 45 years, although Franz Joseph personally suffered the tragedies of the execution of his brother, [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian]] in 1867, the suicide of his son, [[Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria|Crown Prince Rudolf]] in 1889, and the assassination of his wife, [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria|Empress Elisabeth]] in 1898</span>
				<span class='text'>fter the Austro-Prussian War, Austria-Hungary turned its attention to the [[Balkans]], which was a hotspot of international tension due to conflicting interests with the [[Russian Empire]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Bosnian crisis]] was a result of Franz Joseph's annexation of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in 1908, which had been [[Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|occupied by his troops]] since the [[Congress of Berlin]] (1878)</span>
				<span class='text'>On 28 June 1914, the [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassination of the heir-presumptive]] to the Austro-Hungarian throne, his nephew [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]], at the hands of [[Gavrilo Princip]], a [[Yugoslavism|Serbian nationalist]], resulted in Austria-Hungary's declaration of war against the [[Kingdom of Serbia]], which was Russia's ally</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright |Archduke Franz Joseph in 1840 (by [[Moritz Michael Daffinger|Moritz Daffinger]])]][[File:Eduard Klieber Franz Joseph I</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright |Franz Joseph I in 1851 (by Johann Ranzi)]]Franz Joseph was born in the [[Schönbrunn Palace]] in Vienna, the oldest son of [[Franz Karl, Archduke of Austria|Archduke Franz Karl]] (the younger son of [[Francis II of Austria|Holy Roman Emperor Francis II]]), and his wife [[Sophie, Princess of Bavaria|Princess Sophie of Bavaria]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Because his uncle, from 1835 the Emperor [[Ferdinand I of Austria|Ferdinand]], was weak-minded, and his father unambitious and retiring, the young Archduke &quot;Franzl&quot; was brought up by his mother as a future Emperor with emphasis on devotion, responsibility and diligence</span>
				<span class='text'>Franzl came to idolise his grandfather, ''der Gute Kaiser Franz'', who had died shortly before the former's fifth birthday, as the ideal monarch</span>
				<span class='text'>At the age of 13, young Archduke Franz started a career as a colonel in the Austrian army</span>
				<span class='text'>From that point onward, his fashion was dictated by army style and for the rest of his life he normally wore the uniform of a military officer</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Murad|1968|p=61}}Franz Joseph was soon joined by three younger brothers: Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian (born 1832, the future Emperor [[Maximilian of Mexico]]); [[Archduke Charles Louis of Austria|Archduke Karl Ludwig]] (born 1833, and the father of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]]), and [[Archduke Ludwig Viktor]] (born 1842), and a sister, [[Archduchess Maria Anna of Austria (1835-1840)|Maria Anna]] (born 1835), who died at the age of four</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Murad|1968|p=101}}Following the resignation of the Chancellor [[Prince Metternich]] during the [[Revolutions of 1848]], the young Archduke, who it was widely expected would soon succeed his uncle on the throne, was appointed Governor of [[Bohemia]] on 6 April, but never took up the post</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, Franz was sent to the front in Italy, joining [[Joseph Radetzky von Radetz|Field Marshal Radetzky]] on campaign on 29 April, receiving his [[baptism of fire]] on 5 May at [[Battle of Santa Lucia|Santa Lucia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>By all accounts he handled his first military experience calmly and with dignity</span>
				<span class='text'>Around the same time, the Imperial Family was fleeing revolutionary Vienna for the calmer setting of [[Innsbruck]], in [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon, the Archduke was called back from Italy, joining the rest of his family at Innsbruck by mid-June</span>
				<span class='text'>It was at Innsbruck at this time that Franz Joseph first met his cousin Elisabeth, his future bride, then a girl of ten, but apparently the meeting made little impact</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Murad|1968|p=33}}Following victory over the Italians at [[Battle of Custoza (1848)|Custoza]] in late July, the court felt safe to return to Vienna, and Franz Joseph travelled with them</span>
				<span class='text'>But within a few months Vienna again appeared unsafe, and in September the court left again, this time for [[Olmütz]] in [[Moravia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>By now, [[Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Grätz]], the influential military commander in Bohemia, was determined to see the young Archduke soon put onto the throne</span>
				<span class='text'>It was thought that a new ruler would not be bound by the oaths to respect constitutional government to which Ferdinand had been forced to agree, and that it was necessary to find a young, energetic emperor to replace the kindly, but mentally unfit Emperor</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Murad|1968|p=8}}It was thus at Olmütz on 2 December that, by the abdication of his uncle Ferdinand and the renunciation of his father, the mild-mannered Franz Karl, Franz Joseph succeeded as Emperor of Austria</span>
				<span class='text'>It was at this time that he first became known by his second as well as his first Christian name</span>
				<span class='text'>The name &quot;Franz Joseph&quot; was chosen deliberately to bring back memories of the new Emperor's great-granduncle, Emperor [[Josef II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], remembered as a modernising reformer</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Murad|1968|p=6}}==Domestic policy==[[File:KaiserFranzjosef1853-1-</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb||left|Franz Joseph I in 1853]]Under the guidance of the new prime minister [[Felix Schwarzenberg|Prince Schwarzenberg]], the new emperor at first pursued a cautious course, granting a constitution in early 1849</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time, military campaigns were necessary against the Hungarians, [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|who had rebelled against Habsburg central authority]] under the name of their ancient liberties</span>
				<span class='text'>Franz Joseph was also almost immediately faced with a renewal of the fighting in Italy, with King [[Charles Albert of Sardinia]] taking advantage of setbacks in Hungary to resume the war in March 1849</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon, though, the military tide began to turn in favor of Franz Joseph and the Austrian whitecoats</span>
				<span class='text'>Almost immediately, Charles Albert was decisively beaten by Radetzky at [[Battle of Novara (1849)|Novara]], and forced both to sue for peace and to abdicate his throne</span>
				<span class='text'>In Hungary, the situation was more grave and Austrian defeat was quite possible</span>
				<span class='text'>Sensing a need to secure his right to rule, he sought help from Russia, requesting the intervention of [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar Nicholas I]], in order &quot;to prevent the Hungarian insurrection developing into a European calamity</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Russian troops entered Hungary in support of the Austrians and the revolution was crushed by late summer of 1849</span>
				<span class='text'>With order now restored throughout the Empire, Franz Joseph felt free to go back on the constitutional concessions he had made, especially as the Austrian parliament, meeting at [[Kremsier]], had behaved, in the young Emperor's view, abominably</span>
				<span class='text'>The 1849 constitution was suspended, and a policy of absolutist centralism was established, guided by the Minister of the Interior, [[Alexander Bach]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Murad|1968|p=41}}The next few years saw the seeming recovery of Austria's position on the international scene following the near disasters of 1848–1849</span>
				<span class='text'>Under Schwarzenberg's guidance, Austria was able to stymie [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] scheming to create a new German Federation under Prussian leadership, excluding Austria</span>
				<span class='text'>After Schwarzenberg's premature death in 1852, he could not be replaced by statesmen of equal stature, and the Emperor effectively took over himself as prime minister</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Franz Joseph in 1865]]On 18 February 1853, the Emperor survived an assassination attempt by Hungarian nationalist János Libényi</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Murad|1968|p=42}} The emperor was taking a stroll with one of his officers, [[Maximilian Karl Lamoral O'Donnell]], on a city-[[bastion]], when Libényi approached him</span>
				<span class='text'>He immediately struck the emperor from behind with a knife straight at the neck</span>
				<span class='text'>Franz Joseph almost always wore a uniform, which had a high collar that almost completely enclosed the neck</span>
				<span class='text'>The collars of uniforms at that time were made from very sturdy material exactly to counter this kind of attack</span>
				<span class='text'>Even though the Emperor was wounded and bleeding, the collar saved his life</span>
				<span class='text'>Count O'Donnell (descendant of the Irish noble dynasty [[O'Donnell of Tyrconnell]]&lt;ref&gt;''O'Domhnaill Abu – [[O'Donnell]] Clan Newsletter'' no</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Murad|1968|p=42}}O'Donnell, hitherto only a Count by virtue of his Irish nobility, was thereafter made a Count of the [[Habsburg]] Empire, conferred with the Commander's Cross of the Royal Order of Leopold, and his customary O'Donnell arms were augmented by the initials and shield of the ducal House of Austria, with additionally the double-headed eagle of the Empire</span>
				<span class='text'>These arms are emblazoned on the portico of no</span>

				<span class='text'>Libényi was subsequently put on trial and condemned to death for attempted [[regicide]]</span>

				<span class='text'>{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}After this unsuccessful attack, the Emperor's brother [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Ferdinand Maximilian Joseph]], later Emperor of [[Mexico]], called upon Europe's royal families for donations to a new church on the site of the attack</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Murad|1968|p=149}} This was justified on grounds of precedence; from 1452 to the end of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1806, with only one period of interruption under the [[Wittelsbach]]s, the Habsburgs had generally held the German crown</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Murad|1968|p=150}} However, Franz Joseph's desire to retain the non-German territories of the Habsburg [[Austrian Empire]] in the event of German unification proved problematic</span>
				<span class='text'>There quickly developed two factions, one party of German intellectuals favouring a [[Greater Germany]] under the House of Habsburg; the others favouring a [[Lesser Germany]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Greater Germans favoured the inclusion of Austria in a new all-German state on the grounds that [[Austria]] (Österreich) had always been a part of Germanic empires, that it was the leading power of the [[German Confederation]], and that it would be absurd to exclude eight million [[Austrians|Austrian Germans]] from an all-German nation state</span>
				<span class='text'>The champions of a lesser Germany argued against the inclusion of Austria on the grounds that it was a multination state, not a German one, and that its inclusion would bring millions of non-Germans into the German nation state</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Murad|1968|p=151}} If Greater Germany was to prevail, the crown would necessarily have to go to Franz Joseph, who had no desire to cede it in the first place to anyone else</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Murad|1968|p=151}} On the other hand, if the idea of a smaller Germany won out, the German crown could of course not possibly go the [[Emperor of Austria]], but would naturally be offered to the head of the largest and most powerful German state outside of Austria–the [[King of Prussia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The contest between the two ideas thus quickly developed into a contest between Austria and [[Prussia]]</span>
				<span class='text'> After Prussia decisively won the [[Seven Weeks War]], this question was solved; Austria lost no territories as long as they remained out of German affairs</span>

				<span class='text'>]In 1873, two years after the unification of Germany, Franz Joseph entered into the [[League of Three Emperors]] with [[Wilhelm I of Germany|Kaiser Wilhelm I of Germany]] and [[Tsar Alexander II|Tsar Alexander II of Russia]] (who was succeeded by [[Tsar Alexander III]] in 1881)</span>
				<span class='text'>The league had been designed by the German chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]], as an attempt to maintain the peace of Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>It would last intermittently until 1887</span>
				<span class='text'>==The Czech Question===Many Czech people were waiting for political changes in monarchy, including [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]] and others</span>
				<span class='text'>Masaryk served in the Reichsrat (Austrian Parliament) from 1891 to 1893 in the Young Czech Party and again from 1907 to 1914 in the Realist Party (which he founded in 1900), but he did not campaign for the independence of Czechs and Slovaks from Austria-Hungary</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1909 he helped [[Hinko Hinković]] in Vienna in the defense during the fabricated trial against mostly prominent Croats and Serbs, members of the Croato-Serb Coalition (such as [[Frano Supilo]] and [[Svetozar Pribićević]]), and others, who were sentenced to more than 150 years and a number of death penalties</span>

				<span class='text'>Austria's foreign minister, [[Count Alois Lexa von Aehrenthal|Alois von Aehrenthal]], pursued this offer vigorously, resulting in the quid pro quo understanding with Izvolsky, reached on the 16th of September 1908, at the Buchlau Conference</span>
