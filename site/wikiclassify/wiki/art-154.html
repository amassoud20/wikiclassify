				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Attracted to anarchism after the [[Haymarket affair]], Goldman became a writer and a renowned lecturer on anarchist philosophy, women's rights, and social issues, attracting crowds of thousands</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = UIC/&gt; She and anarchist writer [[Alexander Berkman]], her lover and lifelong friend, planned to assassinate industrialist and financier [[Henry Clay Frick]] as an act of [[propaganda of the deed]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Frick survived the attempt on his life in 1892 and Berkman was sentenced to 22 years in prison</span>
				<span class='text'>Goldman was imprisoned several times in the years that followed, for &quot;inciting to riot&quot; and illegally distributing information about [[birth control]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1906, Goldman founded the anarchist journal ''[[Mother Earth (magazine)|Mother Earth]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1917, Goldman and Berkman were sentenced to two years in jail for conspiring to &quot;induce persons not to register&quot; for the [[Conscription in the United States|newly instated draft]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After their release from prison, they were arrested—along with hundreds of others—and deported to her native [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Initially supportive of that country's [[Bolshevik]] revolution, Goldman reversed her opinion in the wake of the [[Kronstadt rebellion]] and denounced the [[Soviet Union]] for its violent repression of independent voices</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1923, she published a book about her experiences, ''[[My Disillusionment in Russia]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>While living in England, Canada, and France, she wrote an autobiography called ''[[Living My Life]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>After the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]], she traveled to Spain to support the [[Spanish Revolution|anarchist revolution]] there</span>
				<span class='text'>She died in [[Toronto]] on May 14, 1940, aged 70</span>
				<span class='text'>uring her life, Goldman was lionized as a [[free-thinking]] &quot;rebel woman&quot; by admirers, and denounced by critics as an advocate of politically motivated murder and violent revolution</span>

				<span class='text'>Although she distanced herself from [[first-wave feminism]] and its efforts toward [[women's suffrage]], she developed new ways of incorporating gender politics into anarchism</span>
				<span class='text'>After decades of obscurity, Goldman's iconic status was revived in the 1970s, when feminist and anarchist scholars rekindled popular interest in her life</span>
				<span class='text'>= Biography ===== Family ===Emma Goldman's [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] family lived in the Lithuanian city of [[Kaunas]] (called Kovno at the time, part of the [[Russian Empire]])</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Goldman, ''Living'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>24</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Goldman's mother Taube Bienowitch had been married before, to a man with whom she had two daughters—Helena in 1860 and Lena in 1862</span>
				<span class='text'>When her first husband died of [[tuberculosis]], Taube was devastated</span>
				<span class='text'>Goldman later wrote: &quot;Whatever love she had had died with the young man to whom she had been married at the age of fifteen</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EGLiv447&quot;&gt;Goldman, ''Living'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>447</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Taube's second [[arranged marriage|marriage was arranged]] by her family and, as Goldman puts it, &quot;mismated from the first&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;EGLiv447&quot;/&gt; Her second husband, Abraham Goldman, invested Taube's inheritance in a business that quickly failed</span>
				<span class='text'>The ensuing hardship combined with the emotional distance of husband and wife to make the household a tense place for the children</span>
				<span class='text'>When Taube became pregnant, Abraham hoped desperately for a son; a daughter, he believed, would serve as one more sign of failure</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Drinnon, ''Rebel'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>5</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; They eventually had three sons, but their first child was Emma</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;The order of birth is unclear; Wexler (in ''Intimate'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>13) notes that although Goldman writes of herself as her mother's fourth child, her brother Louis (who died at the age of six) was probably born after her</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Emma Goldman was born on June 27, 1869</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Chalberg, p</span>
				<span class='text'>12</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Her father used violence to punish his children, beating them when they disobeyed him</span>
				<span class='text'>He used a whip only on Emma, the most rebellious of them</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Chalberg, p</span>
				<span class='text'>13</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Her mother provided scarce comfort, calling only rarely on Abraham to tone down his beatings</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Drinnon, ''Rebel'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>12</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Goldman later speculated that her father's furious temper was at least partly a result of sexual frustration</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;EGLiv447&quot;/&gt;Goldman's relationships with her elder half-sisters, Helena and Lena, were a study in contrasts</span>
				<span class='text'>Helena, the oldest, provided the comfort they lacked from their mother; she filled Goldman's childhood with &quot;whatever joy it had&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Goldman, ''Living'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>11</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Lena, however, was distant and uncharitable</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Intimate'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>12</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The three sisters were joined by brothers Louis (who died at the age of six), Herman (born in 1872), and Moishe (born in 1879)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Intimate'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>13–14</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;=== Adolescence ===[[File:Emma Goldman's family</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|Emma Goldman's family in St</span>
				<span class='text'>Petersberg, Russia in 1882</span>
				<span class='text'>From left to right: Emma, standing; Helena, seated, with Morris on her lap; Taube; Herman; Abraham</span>
				<span class='text'>]When Emma was a young girl, the Goldman family moved to the village of [[Papilė]], where her father ran an inn</span>
				<span class='text'>While her sisters worked, she became friends with a servant named Petrushka, who excited her &quot;first erotic sensations&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Goldman, ''Living'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>20</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Later in Papilė she witnessed a peasant being whipped with a [[knout]] in the street</span>
				<span class='text'>This event traumatized her and contributed to her lifelong distaste for violent authority</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Goldman, ''Living'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>28</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;At the age of seven, Goldman moved with her family to the Prussian city of [[Königsberg]] (then part of the German Empire), and she enrolled in a [[Realschule]]</span>
				<span class='text'>One teacher punished disobedient students—targeting Goldman in particular—by beating their hands with a ruler</span>
				<span class='text'>Another teacher tried to molest his female students and was fired when Goldman fought back</span>
				<span class='text'>She found a sympathetic mentor in her German teacher, who loaned her books and even took her to an opera</span>
				<span class='text'>A passionate student, Goldman passed the exam for admission into a [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]], but her religion teacher refused to provide a certificate of good behavior and she was unable to attend</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Drinnon, ''Rebel'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>6–7</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The family moved to the Russian city of [[Saint Petersburg]], where her father opened one unsuccessful store after another</span>
				<span class='text'>Their poverty forced the children to work, and Goldman took an assortment of jobs including one in a [[corset]] shop</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Chalberg, p</span>
				<span class='text'>15</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; As a teenager Goldman begged her father to allow her to return to school, but instead he threw her French book into the fire and shouted: &quot;Girls do not have to learn much! All a Jewish daughter needs to know is how to prepare [[gefilte fish]], cut noodles fine, and give the man plenty of children</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EGLiv12&quot;&gt;Goldman, ''Living'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>12</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Goldman pursued an independent education [[autodidact|on her own]], however, and soon began to study the political turmoil around her, particularly the [[Nihilist movement|Nihilists]] responsible for assassinating [[Alexander II of Russia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The ensuing turmoil intrigued Goldman, even though she did not fully understand it at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>When she read [[Nikolai Chernyshevsky|Chernyshevsky]]'s novel, ''[[What Is to Be Done? (novel)|What Is to Be Done?]]'' (1863), she found a role model in the protagonist Vera, who adopts a Nihilist philosophy and escapes her repressive family to live freely and organize a sewing [[cooperative]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The book enthralled Goldman and remained a source of inspiration throughout her life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Intimate'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>23–26</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Her father, meanwhile, continued to insist on a domestic future for her, and he tried to arrange for her to be married at the age of fifteen</span>
				<span class='text'>They fought about the issue constantly; he complained that she was becoming a &quot;loose&quot; woman, and she insisted that she would marry for love alone</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;JC16&quot;&gt;Chalberg, p</span>
				<span class='text'>16</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; At the corset shop, she was forced to fend off unwelcome advances from Russian officers and other men</span>
				<span class='text'>One persistent suitor took her into a hotel room and committed what Goldman called &quot;violent contact&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, ''Living'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>22</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; two biographers call it rape</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;JC16&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Falk, ''Love'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>14</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; She was stunned by the experience, overcome by &quot;shock at the discovery that the contact between man and woman could be so brutal and painful</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EGLiv23&quot;&gt;Goldman, ''Living'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>23</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Goldman felt that the encounter forever soured her interactions with men</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;EGLiv23&quot;/&gt;=== Rochester, New York ===[[File:Emma goldman 1886</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|Emma Goldman in 1886]]In 1885, Helena made plans to move to New York to join her sister Lena and her husband</span>
				<span class='text'>Goldman wanted to join her sister, but their father refused to allow it</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite Helena's offer to pay for the trip, Abraham turned a deaf ear to their pleas</span>
				<span class='text'>Desperate, Goldman threatened to throw herself into the [[Neva River]] if she could not go</span>
				<span class='text'>He finally agreed, and on December 29, 1885, Helena and Emma arrived at New York's [[Castle Garden]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Intimate'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>27</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; They moved into the [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] home Lena had made with her husband Samuel</span>
				<span class='text'>Fleeing the rising [[antisemitism]] of Saint Petersburg, their parents and brothers joined them a year later</span>
				<span class='text'>Goldman began working as a [[seamstress]], sewing overcoats for more than ten hours a day, earning two and a half dollars a week</span>
				<span class='text'>She asked for a raise and was denied; she quit and took work at a smaller shop nearby</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Intimate'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>30–31</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;At her new job, Goldman met a fellow worker named Jacob Kershner, who shared her love for books, dancing, and traveling, as well as her frustration with the monotony of factory work</span>
				<span class='text'>After four months, they married in February 1887</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Falk, ''Love'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>15–16</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Once he moved in with Goldman's family, however, their relationship faltered</span>
				<span class='text'>On their wedding night she discovered that he was impotent; they became emotionally and physically distant</span>
				<span class='text'>Before long he became jealous and suspicious</span>
				<span class='text'>She, meanwhile, was becoming more engaged with the political turmoil around her—particularly the fallout of the 1886 [[Haymarket affair]] in Chicago and the [[anti-authoritarian]] political philosophy of [[anarchism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Less than a year after the wedding, they were divorced; he begged her to return and threatened to poison himself if she did not</span>
				<span class='text'>They reunited, but after three months she left once again</span>
				<span class='text'>Her parents considered her behavior &quot;loose&quot; and refused to allow Goldman into their home</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Drinnon, ''Rebel'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>15–17</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Carrying her sewing machine in one hand and a bag with five dollars in the other, she left Rochester and headed southeast to New York City</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Chalberg, p</span>
				<span class='text'>27</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;=== Most and Berkman ===[[File:Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Goldman enjoyed a decades-long relationship with her lover [[Alexander Berkman]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Photo circa 1917–1919</span>
				<span class='text'>]On her first day in the city, Goldman met two men who would forever change her life</span>
				<span class='text'>At Sachs's Café, a gathering place for radicals, she was introduced to [[Alexander Berkman]], an anarchist who invited her to a public speech that evening</span>
				<span class='text'>They went to hear [[Johann Most]], editor of a radical publication called ''[[Freiheit (1879)|Freiheit]]'' and an advocate of &quot;[[propaganda of the deed]]&quot;—the use of violence to instigate change</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Chalberg, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>27–28</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; She was impressed by his fiery oration, and he took her under his wing, training her in methods of public speaking</span>
				<span class='text'>He encouraged her vigorously, telling her that she was &quot;to take my place when I am gone</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, ''Living'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>40</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  One of her first public talks in support of &quot;the Cause&quot; was in Rochester</span>
				<span class='text'>After convincing Helena not to tell their parents of her speech, Goldman found her mind a blank once on stage</span>
				<span class='text'>Suddenly,&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, ''Living'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>51</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|something strange happened</span>
				<span class='text'>In a flash I saw it—every incident of my three years in Rochester: the Garson factory, its drudgery and humiliation, the failure of my marriage, the Chicago crime</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> began to speak</span>
				<span class='text'>Words I had never heard myself utter before came pouring forth, faster and faster</span>
				<span class='text'>They came with passionate intensity</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>he audience had vanished, the hall itself had disappeared; I was conscious only of my own words, of my ecstatic song</span>
				<span class='text'>}Enchanted by the experience, she refined her public persona during subsequent engagements</span>
				<span class='text'>Quickly, however, she found herself arguing with Most over her independence</span>
				<span class='text'>After a momentous speech in Cleveland, she felt as though she had become &quot;a parrot repeating Most's views&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldman-Living-52&quot;&gt;Goldman, ''Living'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>52</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and resolved to express herself on the stage</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon her return in New York, Most became furious and told her: &quot;Who is not with me is against me!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, ''Living'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>54</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; She left ''Freiheit'' and joined with another publication, ''[[Die Autonomie]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Intimate'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>53</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Meanwhile, she had begun a friendship with Berkman, whom she affectionately called Sasha</span>
				<span class='text'>Before long they became lovers and moved into a communal apartment with his cousin Modest &quot;Fedya&quot; Stein and Goldman's friend, Helen Minkin, in rural [[Woodstock, Illinois]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Intimate'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>57</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Although their relationship had numerous difficulties, Goldman and Berkman would share a close bond for decades, united by their anarchist principles and commitment to personal equality</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Intimate'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>57–58</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In 1892, Goldman joined with Berkman and Berkman's cousin, Modest Stein, in opening an ice cream shop in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]]</span>
				<span class='text'> After only a few months of operating the shop, however, Goldman and Berkman were deflected from the venture by their involvement in the [[Homestead Strike]]</span>

				<span class='text'>In June 1892, a steel plant in [[Homestead, Pennsylvania]] owned by [[Andrew Carnegie]] became the focus of national attention when talks between the [[Carnegie Steel Company]] and the [[Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers]] (AA) broke down</span>
				<span class='text'>The factory's manager was [[Henry Clay Frick]], a fierce opponent of the union</span>
				<span class='text'>When a final round of talks failed at the end of June, management closed the plant and locked out the workers, who immediately went on strike</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Strikebreaker]]s were brought in and the company hired [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkerton guards]] to protect them</span>
				<span class='text'>On July 6, a fight broke out between three hundred Pinkerton guards and a crowd of armed union workers</span>
				<span class='text'>During the twelve-hour gunfight, seven guards and nine strikers were killed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Intimate'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>61–62</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Henry Clay Frick</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|upright|Goldman and Berkman believed that a retaliatory assassination of [[Carnegie Steel Company]] manager [[Henry Clay Frick]] (''pictured'') would &quot;strike terror into the soul of his class&quot; and &quot;bring the teachings of Anarchism before the world&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wexler, ''Intimate'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>63</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;]]When a majority of the nation's newspapers came out in support of the strikers, Goldman and Berkman resolved to assassinate Frick, an action they expected would inspire the workers to revolt against the capitalist system</span>
				<span class='text'>Berkman chose to carry out the assassination, and ordered Goldman to stay behind in order to explain his motives after he went to jail</span>
				<span class='text'>He would be in charge of the deed; she of the word</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Intimate'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>63–65</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Berkman tried and failed to make a bomb, then set off for [[Pittsburgh]] to buy a gun and a suit of decent clothes</span>
				<span class='text'>Goldman, meanwhile, decided to help fund the scheme through prostitution</span>
				<span class='text'>Remembering the character of Sonya in [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]'s novel ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' (1866), she mused: &quot;She had become a prostitute in order to support her little brothers and sisters</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Once on the street, she caught the eye of a man who took her into a saloon, bought her a beer, gave her ten dollars, informed her she did not have &quot;the knack&quot;, and told her to quit the business</span>
				<span class='text'>She was &quot;too astounded for speech&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;EGLiv91&quot;/&gt; She wrote to Helena, claiming illness, and asked her for fifteen dollars</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Drinnon, ''Rebel'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>45</span>

				<span class='text'>During a talk in [[Cleveland]], Czolgosz had approached Goldman and asked her advice on which books he should read</span>

				<span class='text'>]Goldman began to worry about the future of Spain's anarchism when the CNT-FAI joined a coalition government in 1937—against the core anarchist principle of abstaining from state structures—and, more distressingly, made repeated concessions to Communist forces in the name of uniting against fascism</span>
				<span class='text'>She wrote that cooperating with Communists in Spain was &quot;a denial of our comrades in Stalin's concentration camps&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Russia, meanwhile, refused to send weapons to anarchist forces, and disinformation campaigns were being waged against the anarchists across Europe and the US</span>

				<span class='text'>She wrote regularly for ''[[Freedom (newspaper)|Spain and the World]]'', a biweekly newspaper focusing on the civil war</span>
				<span class='text'>In May 1937, however, Communist-led forces [[Barcelona May Days|attacked anarchist strongholds]] and broke up agrarian collectives</span>

				<span class='text'>]As the events preceding [[World War II]] began to unfold in Europe, Goldman reiterated her opposition to wars waged by governments</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;[M]uch as I loathe [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]], [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] and [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]&quot;, she wrote to a friend, &quot;I would not support a war against them and for the democracies which, in the last analysis, are only Fascist in disguise</span>

				<span class='text'>236</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; She felt that England and France had missed their opportunity to oppose fascism, and that the coming war would only result in &quot;a new form of madness in the world&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;WexEx236&quot;/&gt; This position was vastly unpopular, as Hitler's attacks on Jewish communities reverberated throughout the Jewish diaspora</span>
				<span class='text'>== Death ===On Saturday, February 17, 1940, Goldman suffered a debilitating stroke</span>

				<span class='text'>While she rejected [[orthodoxy]] and fundamentalist thinking, she was an important contributor to several fields of modern political philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>She was influenced by many diverse thinkers and writers, including [[Mikhail Bakunin]], [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Nikolai Chernyshevsky]], and [[Mary Wollstonecraft]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Another philosopher who influenced Goldman was [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In her autobiography, she wrote: &quot;Nietzsche was not a social theorist, but a poet, a rebel, and innovator</span>
				<span class='text'>His aristocracy was neither of birth nor of purse; it was the spirit</span>
				<span class='text'>In that respect Nietzsche was an anarchist, and all true anarchists were [[Aristocracy (government)|aristocrats]]</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, ''Living'', 194</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;=== Anarchism ===Anarchism was central to Goldman's view of the world and she is today considered one of the most important figures in the history of anarchism</span>
				<span class='text'>First drawn to it during the persecution of anarchists after the 1886 [[Haymarket affair]], she wrote and spoke regularly on behalf of anarchism</span>
				<span class='text'>In the title essay of her book ''[[Anarchism and Other Essays]]'', she wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;Anarchism, then, really stands for the liberation of the human mind from the dominion of religion; the liberation of the human body from the dominion of property; liberation from the shackles and restraint of government</span>
				<span class='text'>Anarchism stands for a social order based on the free grouping of individuals for the purpose of producing real social wealth; an order that will guarantee to every human being free access to the earth and full enjoyment of the necessities of life, according to individual desires, tastes, and inclinations</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Goldman, ''Anarchism'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>62</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Goldman's anarchism was intensely personal</span>
				<span class='text'>She believed it was necessary for anarchist thinkers to live their beliefs, demonstrating their convictions with every action and word</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;I don't care if a man's theory for tomorrow is correct,&quot; she once wrote</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;I care if his spirit of today is correct</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WexInt92&quot;&gt;Quoted in Wexler, ''Intimate'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>92</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Anarchism and free association were to her logical responses to the confines of government control and capitalism</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;It seems to me that ''these'' are the new forms of life,&quot; she wrote, &quot;and that they will take the place of the old, not by preaching or voting, but by living them</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WexInt92&quot;/&gt;At the same time, she believed that the movement on behalf of human liberty must be staffed by liberated humans</span>
				<span class='text'>While dancing among fellow anarchists one evening, she was chided by an associate for her carefree demeanor</span>
				<span class='text'>In her autobiography, Goldman wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;I told him to mind his own business, I was tired of having the Cause constantly thrown in my face</span>
				<span class='text'>I did not believe that a Cause which stood for a beautiful ideal, for anarchism, for release and freedom from conventions and prejudice, should demand denial of life and joy</span>
				<span class='text'>I insisted that our Cause could not expect me to behave as a nun and that the movement should not be turned into a cloister</span>
				<span class='text'>If it meant that, I did not want it</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;I want freedom, the right to self-expression, everybody's right to beautiful, radiant things</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, ''Living'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>56</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;==== Tactical uses of violence ====Goldman, in her political youth, held targeted violence to be a legitimate means of revolutionary struggle</span>
				<span class='text'>Goldman at the time believed that the use of violence, while distasteful, could be justified in relation to the social benefits it might accrue</span>
				<span class='text'>She advocated [[propaganda of the deed]]—''attentat'', or violence carried out to encourage the masses to revolt</span>
				<span class='text'>She supported her partner [[Alexander Berkman]]'s attempt to kill industrialist [[Henry Clay Frick]], and even begged him to allow her to participate</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;EGLiv88&quot;&gt;Goldman, ''Living'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>88</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; She believed that Frick's actions during the [[Homestead strike]] were reprehensible and that his murder would produce a positive result for working people</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Yes,&quot; she wrote later in her autobiography, &quot;the end in this case justified the means</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EGLiv88&quot;/&gt; While she never gave explicit approval of [[Leon Czolgosz]]'s assassination of US President [[William McKinley]], she defended his ideals and believed actions like his were a natural consequence of repressive institutions</span>
				<span class='text'>As she wrote in &quot;The Psychology of Political Violence&quot;: &quot;the accumulated forces in our social and economic life, culminating in an act of violence, are similar to the terrors of the atmosphere, manifested in storm and lightning</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, ''Anarchism'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>79</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Her experiences in Russia led her to qualify her earlier belief that revolutionary ends might justify violent means</span>
				<span class='text'>In the afterword to ''[[My Disillusionment in Russia]]'', she wrote: &quot;There is no greater fallacy than the belief that aims and purposes are one thing, while methods and tactics are another</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> The means employed become, through individual habit and social practice, part and parcel of the final purpose</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;  In the same chapter, however, Goldman affirmed that &quot;Revolution is indeed a violent process,&quot; and noted that violence was the &quot;tragic inevitability of revolutionary upheavals</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot; &lt;ref&gt;Goldman, ''Disillusionment'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>260–264</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Some misinterpreted her comments on the Bolshevik terror as a rejection of all militant force, but Goldman corrected this in the preface to the first US edition of ''My Disillusionment in Russia'':&lt;blockquote&gt;The argument that destruction and terror are part of revolution I do not dispute</span>
				<span class='text'>I know that in the past every great political and social change necessitated violence</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>lack slavery might still be a legalized institution in the United States but for the militant spirit of the John Browns</span>
				<span class='text'>I have never denied that violence is inevitable, nor do I gainsay it now</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet it is one thing to employ violence in combat, as a means of defense</span>
				<span class='text'>It is quite another thing to make a principle of terrorism, to institutionalize it, to assign it the most vital place in the social struggle</span>
				<span class='text'>Such terrorism begets counter-revolution and in turn itself becomes counter-revolutionary</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/blockquote&gt;Goldman saw the militarization of Soviet society not as a result of armed resistance per se, but of the statist vision of the Bolsheviks, writing that &quot;an insignificant minority bent on creating an absolute State is necessarily driven to oppression and terrorism</span>

				<span class='text'>tml &quot;Preface to First Volume of American Edition&quot; for ''My Disillusionment in Russia''] (Emma Goldman Papers Project, University of California-Berkeley)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;=== Capitalism and labor ===Goldman believed that the economic system of capitalism was incompatible with human liberty</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;The only demand that property recognizes,&quot; she wrote in ''Anarchism and Other Essays'', &quot;is its own gluttonous appetite for greater wealth, because wealth means power; the power to subdue, to crush, to exploit, the power to enslave, to outrage, to degrade</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EGAnar54&quot;&gt;Goldman, ''Anarchism'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>54</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; She also argued that capitalism dehumanized workers, &quot;turning the producer into a mere particle of a machine, with less will and decision than his master of steel and iron</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EGAnar54&quot;/&gt;Originally opposed to anything less than complete revolution, Goldman was challenged during one talk by an elderly worker in the front row</span>
				<span class='text'>In her autobiography, she wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;He said that he understood my impatience with such small demands as a few hours less a day, or a few dollars more a week</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> But what were men of his age to do? They were not likely to live to see the ultimate overthrow of the capitalist system</span>
				<span class='text'>Were they also to forgo the release of perhaps two hours a day from the hated work? That was all they could hope to see realized in their lifetime</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Goldman-Living-52&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Goldman realized that smaller efforts for improvement such as higher wages and shorter hours could be part of a social revolution</span>
				<span class='text'>== The state – militarism, prison, voting, speech ===Goldman viewed the state as essentially and inevitably a tool of control and domination</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, Goldman believed that voting was useless at best and dangerous at worst</span>
				<span class='text'>Voting, she wrote, provided an illusion of participation while masking the true structures of decision-making</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, Goldman advocated targeted resistance in the form of strikes, protests, and &quot;direct action against the invasive, meddlesome authority of our moral code&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;WexInt91&quot;&gt;Wexler, ''Intimate'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>91</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; She maintained an anti-voting position even when many anarcho-syndicalists in 1930s Spain voted for the formation of a liberal republic</span>
				<span class='text'>Goldman wrote that any power anarchists wielded as a voting bloc should instead be used to strike across the country</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Exile'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>167</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; She disagreed with the movement for [[women's suffrage]], which demanded the right of women to vote</span>
				<span class='text'>In her essay &quot;Woman Suffrage&quot;, she ridicules the idea that women's involvement would infuse the democratic state with a more just orientation: &quot;As if women have not sold their votes, as if women politicians cannot be bought!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, ''Anarchism'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>205</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; She agreed with the suffragists' assertion that women are equal to men, but disagreed that their participation alone would make the state more just</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;To assume, therefore, that she would succeed in purifying something which is not susceptible of purification, is to credit her with supernatural powers</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, ''Anarchism'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>198</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Goldman was also a passionate critic of the prison system, critiquing both the treatment of prisoners and the social causes of crime</span>
				<span class='text'>Goldman viewed crime as a natural outgrowth of an unjust economic system, and in her essay &quot;Prisons: A Social Crime and Failure&quot;, she quoted liberally from the 19th-century authors [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]] and [[Oscar Wilde]] on prisons, and wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;Year after year the gates of prison hells return to the world an emaciated, deformed, will-less, shipwrecked crew of humanity, with the Cain mark on their foreheads, their hopes crushed, all their natural inclinations thwarted</span>
				<span class='text'>With nothing but hunger and inhumanity to greet them, these victims soon sink back into crime as the only possibility of existence</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Goldman, ''Anarchism'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>120</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Goldman was a committed [[war resister]], believing that wars were fought by the state on behalf of capitalists</span>
				<span class='text'> She was particularly opposed to the [[conscription|draft]], viewing it as one of the worst of the state's forms of coercion, and was one of the founders of the [[No-Conscription League]]—for which she was ultimately arrested (1917), imprisoned and deported (1919)</span>
				<span class='text'>oldman was routinely surveilled, arrested, and imprisoned for her speech and organizing activities in support of [[workers]] and various strikes, access to [[birth control]], and in [[opposition to World War I]]</span>
				<span class='text'> As a result, she became active in the early 20th century free speech movement, seeing freedom of expression as a fundamental necessity for achieving social change</span>

				<span class='text'>]Although she was hostile to the suffragist goals of [[first-wave feminism]], Goldman advocated passionately for the rights of women, and is today heralded as a founder of [[anarcha-feminism]], which challenges [[patriarchy]] as a hierarchy to be resisted alongside state power and class divisions</span>

				<span class='text'>Like many feminists of her time, she saw abortion as a tragic consequence of social conditions, and birth control as a positive alternative</span>
				<span class='text'>Goldman was also an advocate of [[free love]], and a strong critic of marriage</span>
