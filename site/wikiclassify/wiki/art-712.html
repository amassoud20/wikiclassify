				<span class='text'>quot; Upstaging, camera mugging, doing [[spit-take]]s, inserting old comedy bits, and climaxing the show with a maudlin performance of &quot;[[September Song]]&quot; complete with a pre-arranged standing ovation (something producer [[Lorne Michaels]] had never sanctioned) resulted in Berle being banned from hosting the show again</span>
				<span class='text'>The episode was also barred from being rerun until surfacing in 2003, because Michaels thought it brought down the show's reputation</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|left|thumb|Berle at the [[41st Primetime Emmy Awards]] in 1989]]Another well-known incident of upstaging occurred during the 1982 [[Emmy Award]]s, when Berle and [[Martha Raye]] were the presenters of the Emmy for Outstanding Writing</span>
				<span class='text'>Berle was reluctant to give up the microphone to the award's recipients, from ''[[Second City Television]]'', and interrupted actor/writer [[Joe Flaherty]]'s acceptance speech several times</span>
				<span class='text'>After Flaherty would make a joke, Berle would reply sarcastically &quot;Oh, that's funny&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the kindly, smiling Flaherty's response of &quot;Go to sleep, Uncle Miltie&quot; flustered Berle, who could only reply with a stunned &quot;What</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>&quot; ''SCTV'' later created a parody sketch of the incident, in which Flaherty beats up a Berle look-alike, shouting, &quot;You'll never ruin another acceptance speech, Uncle Miltie!&quot;One of his most popular performances in his later years was guest starring in 1992 in ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'' as womanizing, wise-cracking patient Max Jakey</span>
				<span class='text'>Most of his dialogue was improvised and he shocked the studio audience by mistakenly blurting out a curse word</span>
				<span class='text'>He also appeared in an acclaimed and Emmy-nominated turn on ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'' as an aging comedian befriended by [[Steve Sanders (90210)|Steve Sanders]], who idolizes him, but is troubled by his bouts of senility due to [[Alzheimer's disease]]</span>

				<span class='text'>In this episode, friendly aliens from space receive TV signals from the Earth of the 1950s and travel to [[Hollywood]] in search of their idols, [[Lucille Ball]], [[Jackie Gleason]], [[The Three Stooges]], [[Burns and Allen]], and Milton Berle</span>
