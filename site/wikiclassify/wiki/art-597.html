				<span class='text'>According to Lee, the Chinese community issued an ultimatum to him to stop teaching non-Chinese</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;''Bruce Lee: The Immortal Dragon'', January 29, 2002, A&amp;E Television Networks&lt;/ref&gt; Wong denied this, stating that he requested to fight Lee after Lee boasted during one of his demonstrations at a Chinatown theatre that he could beat anyone in San Francisco, and that Wong himself did not discriminate against Caucasians or other non-Chinese</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Dorgan&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Dorgan|1980|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee commented, &quot;That paper had all the names of the [[sifu]] from Chinatown, but they don't scare me&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Wong and William Chen stated that the fight lasted an unusually long 20–25 minutes</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Dorgan&quot;/&gt; Wong claims that he had originally expected a serious but polite bout; however Lee had attacked him very aggressively with intent to kill, straight from the beginning of the bout when he had replied to Wong's traditional handshake offer by &quot;pretending to extend a friendly hand only to suddenly transform the hand into a four-pronged spear aimed at Wong's eyes&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Forced to defend his life, he had nonetheless refrained from striking Lee with killing force when the opportunity presented itself because it could earn him a prison sentence</span>
				<span class='text'>The fight ended due to Lee's &quot;unusually winded&quot; condition, as opposed to a decisive blow by either fighter</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Dorgan&quot;/&gt; According to Bruce Lee, [[Linda Lee Cadwell]], and [[James Yimm Lee]] however, the fight lasted a mere 3 minutes with a decisive victory for Lee</span>
				<span class='text'>In Cadwell's account, &quot;The fight ensued, it was a no-holds-barred fight, it took three minutes</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;A couple of weeks after the bout, Lee gave an interview claiming that he had defeated an unnamed challenger, which Wong says was an obvious reference to him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;Dorgan&quot;/&gt; In response, Wong published his own account of the fight in the Chinese ''Pacific Weekly'', a [[Chinese-language]] newspaper in San Francisco, with an invitation to a public rematch if Lee was not satisfied with the account</span>

				<span class='text'>The controversial match with Wong Jack Man influenced Lee's philosophy about martial arts</span>
				<span class='text'>Lee concluded that the fight had lasted too long and that he had failed to live up to his potential using his [[Wing Chun]] techniques</span>
				<span class='text'>He took the view that traditional martial arts techniques were too rigid and formalistic to be practical in scenarios of chaotic [[street fighting]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Lee decided to develop a system with an emphasis on &quot;practicality, flexibility, speed, and efficiency&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He started to use different methods of training such as [[weight training]] for strength, running for endurance, stretching for flexibility, and many others which he constantly adapted, including fencing and basic boxing techniques</span>
				<span class='text'>ee emphasised what he called &quot;the style of no style&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>This consisted of getting rid of the formalised approach which Lee claimed was indicative of traditional styles</span>
				<span class='text'>Lee felt the system he now called Jun Fan Gung Fu was even too restrictive, and eventually evolved into a philosophy and martial art he would come to call ''Jeet Kune Do'' or the ''Way of the Intercepting Fist</span>
				<span class='text'>' It is a term he would later regret, because Jeet Kune Do implied specific parameters that styles connote; whereas the idea of his martial art was to exist outside of parameters and limitations</span>

				<span class='text'>He used traditional [[bodybuilding]] techniques to build some muscle mass, not overdone that could decrease speed or flexibility</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time in balance, Lee was careful to admonish that mental and spiritual preparation are fundamental to the success of physical training in martial arts skills</span>
