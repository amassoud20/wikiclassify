				<span class='text'>The song came in third place encouraging Stig Anderson and became a hit in Sweden</span>
				<span class='text'>The first signs of foreign success came as a surprise as the Andersson and Ulvaeus single Shes My Kind of Girl was released through  in Japan in March 1972 giving the duo a Top 10 hit</span>

				<span class='text'>The studio sessions were handled by  who experimented with a  production technique that became the wholly new sound</span>
				<span class='text'>Stig Anderson arranged an English translation of the lyrics by  and Phil Cody and they thought this would be a suire winner</span>

				<span class='text'>The album did well and the Ring Ring single was a hit in many parts of Europe and also in South Africa</span>

				<span class='text'>When Agnetha Fältskog gave birth to her first child in 1973 she was replaced for a short period by Inger Brundin on a trip to West Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>In early 1973 Stig Anderson tired of unwieldy names started to er to the group privately and publicly as ABBA</span>
				<span class='text'>At first this was a play on words as  is also the name of a well known fish canning company in Sweden and itself an acronym</span>
				<span class='text'>However since the fish canners were unknown outside Sweden Anderson came to believe the name would work in international markets</span>
				<span class='text'>A competition to find a suitable name for the group was held in a Gothenburg newspaper</span>
				<span class='text'>The group was impressed with the names Alibaba FABB and Baba but in the end all the entries were ignored and it was officially announced in the summer that the group were to be known as ABBA</span>
				<span class='text'>The group negotiated with the canners for the rights to the name</span>

				<span class='text'>This was first written as Björn Benny Agnetha amp Frida but was subsequently crossed out with ABBA written in large letters on top</span>
				<span class='text'>The official logo using the bold version of the  typeface was designed by Rune Söderqvist and appeared for the first time on the  single in August 1976 and subsequently on all later original albums and singles</span>

				<span class='text'> As the group entered the Melodifestivalen with  but failed to qualify as the 1973 Swedish entry Stig Anderson immediately started planning for the 1974 contest</span>
				<span class='text'>lvaeus Andersson and Stig Anderson believed in the possibilities of using the  as a way to make the music business aware of them as songwriters as well as the band itself</span>
				<span class='text'>In late 1973 they were invited by Swedish television to contribute a song for the  and from a number of new songs the upbeat song  was chosen the group was now inspired by the growing  scene in England</span>
				<span class='text'>BBA won their national heats on Swedish television on 9 February 1974 and with this third attempt were far more experienced and better prepared for the Eurovision Song Contest</span>
				<span class='text'>Winning the  on 6 April 1974 gave ABBA the chance to tour Europe and perform on major television shows thus the band saw the Waterloo single chart in many European countries</span>
				<span class='text'>Waterloo was ABBAs first number one single in big markets such as the UK and West Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>In the United States the song peaked at number six on the  chart paving the way for their first album and their first trip as a group there</span>
				<span class='text'>Albeit a short promotional visit it included their first performance on American television </span>
				<span class='text'>The album  only peaked at number 145 on the  chart but received unanimous high praise from the US critics  called it a compelling and fascinating debut album that captures the spirit of mainstream pop quite effectively … an immensely enjoyable and pleasant project while  characterized it as a perfect blend of exceptional lovable compositions</span>
				<span class='text'>BBAs follow up single  peaked at number 27 on the US  and was a number two hit in West Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>However in the United Kingdom ABBAs British record label Epic decided to re release a remixed version of Ring Ring instead of Honey Honey and a cover version of the latter by  peaked at number 10</span>
				<span class='text'>Both records debuted on the UK chart within one week of each other</span>
				<span class='text'>Ring Ring failed to reach the Top 30 in the United Kingdom increasing growing speculation that the group was simply a Eurovision </span>
				<span class='text'>In November 1974 ABBA embarked on their first European tour playing dates in Denmark West Germany and Austria</span>
				<span class='text'>It was not as successful as the band had hoped since most of the venues did not sell out</span>
				<span class='text'>Due to a lack of demand they were even forced to cancel a few shows including a sole concert scheduled in Switzerland</span>
				<span class='text'>The second leg of the tour which took them through Scandinavia in January 1975 was very different</span>
				<span class='text'>They played to full houses everywhere and finally got the reception they had aimed for</span>
				<span class='text'>Live performances continued during the summer of 1975 when ABBA embarked on a fourteen open air date tour of Sweden and Finland</span>
				<span class='text'>Their  show at the  amusement park had an estimated audience of 19200</span>
				<span class='text'> Björn Ulvaeus later said that If you look at the singles we released straight after Waterloo we were trying to be more like the  a semi glam rock group which was stupid because we were always a pop group</span>
				<span class='text'>name Guardian2014 In late 1974 So Long was released as a single in the United Kingdom but it received no airplay from Radio 1 and failed to chart</span>
				<span class='text'>In the summer of 1975 ABBA released  which again received little airplay on Radio 1 but managed to climb the charts to number 38</span>
				<span class='text'>Later that year the release of their self titled third studio album  and single  brought back their chart presence in the UK where the single hit number six and the album peaked at number 13</span>
				<span class='text'>SOS also became ABBAs second number one single in Germany and their third in Australia</span>
				<span class='text'>Success was further solidified with  reaching number one in the United Kingdom Germany and Australia</span>
				<span class='text'>In the United States  peaked at number 10 on the  Top 100 singles chart and number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart picking up the  Award along the way as one of the most played songs on American radio in 1975</span>
				<span class='text'>he success of the group in the United States had until that time been limited to single releases</span>
				<span class='text'>By early 1976 the group already had four Top 30 singles on the US charts but the album market proved to be tough to crack</span>
				<span class='text'>The eponymous ABBA  album generated three American hits but it only peaked at number 165 on the Cashbox album chart and number 174 on the Billboard 200 chart</span>
				<span class='text'>Opinions were voiced by Creem in particular that in the US ABBA had endured a very sloppy promotional campaign</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless the group enjoyed warm reviews from the American press</span>
				<span class='text'> went as far as saying that there is a recurrent thread of taste and artistry inherent in Abbas marketing creativity and presentation that makes it almost embarrassing to critique their efforts while Creem wrote SOS is surrounded on this LP by so many good tunes that the mind boggles</span>
				<span class='text'>n Australia the airing of the music videos for I Do I Do I Do I Do I Do and Mamma Mia on the nationally broadcast TV pop show  which premiered in November 1974 saw the band rapidly gain enormous popularity and Countdown become a key promoter of the group via their distinctive music videos</span>
				<span class='text'>This started an immense interest for ABBA in Australia resulting in both the single and album holding down the No</span>
				<span class='text'>1 positions on the charts for months</span>
				<span class='text'>n March 1976 the band released the compilation album  despite having had only six top 40 hits in the United Kingdom and the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless it became their first UK number one album and also took ABBA into the Top 50 on the US album charts for the first time eventually selling more than a million copies there</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time Germany released a compilation named The Very Best of ABBA also becoming a number one album there whereas the Greatest Hits compilation followed a few months later to number two on the German charts despite all similarities with The Very Best album</span>
				<span class='text'>Also included on Greatest Hits was a new single  which went to number one in at least thirteen countries worldwide including the United Kingdom Germany and Australia and the single went on to sell over 10ampnbspmillion copies worldwide</span>
				<span class='text'> In Australia the song occupied the top position for 14 weeks and stayed in the chart for 40 weeks tying with   for longest running number one and making Fernando one of the best selling singles of all time in Australia</span>
				<span class='text'>That same year the group received its first international prize with Fernando being chosen as the Best Studio Recording of 1975</span>
				<span class='text'>In the United States Fernando reached the Top 10 of the Cashbox Top 100 singles chart and number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100</span>
				<span class='text'>It also topped the  chart ABBAs first American number one single on any chart</span>
				<span class='text'>he groups fourth studio album  a number one bestseller in Europe and Australia represented a new level of accomplishment in both songwriting and studio work prompting rave reviews from more rock oriented UK music weeklies such as  and  and mostly appreciative notices from US critics</span>
				<span class='text'>Hit after hit flowed from Arrival  another number one in Germany and Australia and  ABBAs sixth consecutive German number one as well as another UK number one</span>
				<span class='text'>The real sensation was  not only topping the charts in loyal markets the UK Germany and Australia but also reaching number one in the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>In South Africa ABBA had astounding success with Fernando Dancing Queen and Knowing Me Knowing You being among the top 20 best selling singles for 1976–77</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1977 Arrival was nominated for the inaugural  in the category Best International Album of the Year</span>
				<span class='text'>By this time ABBA were popular in the United Kingdom most of Western Europe Australia and New Zealand</span>
				<span class='text'>In Frida – The DVD Lyngstad explains how she and Fältskog developed as singers as ABBAs recordings grew more complex over the years</span>
				<span class='text'>he bands popularity in the United States would remain on a comparatively smaller scale and Dancing Queen became the only Billboard Hot 100 number one single ABBA had there they did however get three more singles to the number one position on other Billboard charts including Billboard Adult Contemporary and </span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless Arrival finally became a true breakthrough release for ABBA on the US album market where it peaked at number 20 on the Billboard 200 chart and was certified gold by </span>

				<span class='text'>The groups status had changed dramatically and they were clearly regarded as superstars</span>
