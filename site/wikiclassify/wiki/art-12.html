				<span class='text'>ABBA was the first group to come from a non-English-speaking country to enjoy consistent success in the charts of English-speaking countries, including the [[UK Singles Chart|UK]], [[Irish Recorded Music Association|Ireland]], the [[Hot 100|U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>

				<span class='text'>At the height of their popularity, both relationships were suffering strain which ultimately resulted in the collapse of the Ulvaeus–Fältskog marriage in 1979 and the Andersson–Lyngstad marriage in 1981</span>
				<span class='text'>These relationship changes were reflected in the group's music, with later compositions including more introspective, brooding, dark lyrics</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;After ABBA disbanded in December 1982, Andersson and Ulvaeus achieved success writing music for the stage, while Lyngstad and Fältskog pursued solo careers with mixed success</span>
				<span class='text'>ABBA's music declined in popularity until several films, notably ''[[Muriel's Wedding]]'' (1994) and ''[[The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert]]'' (1994), revived public interest in the group and the spawning of several [[tribute band]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1999, ABBA's music was adapted into the successful musical ''[[Mamma Mia!]]'' that toured worldwide</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Mamma Mia! (film)|A film of the same name]], released in 2008, became the highest-grossing film in the United Kingdom that year</span>
				<span class='text'>BBA were honoured at the 50th anniversary celebration of the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] in 2005, when their hit &quot;[[Waterloo (ABBA song)|Waterloo]]&quot; was chosen as the best song in the competition's history</span>

				<span class='text'>The Hep Stars were known as &quot;the Swedish Beatles&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Retrieved 19 April 2014</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; They also set up Hep House, their equivalent of [[Apple Corps]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Andersson played the keyboard and eventually started writing original songs for his band, many of which became major hits, including &quot;No Response&quot; that hit number-three in 1965, &quot;Sunny Girl&quot;, &quot;Wedding&quot;, and &quot;Consolation&quot;, all of which hit number-one in 1966</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palm|2001|pp=86–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andersson also had a fruitful songwriting collaboration with [[Lasse Berghagen]], with whom he wrote his first [[Svensktoppen]] entry, &quot;Sagan om lilla Sofie&quot; (&quot;The Story of Little Sophie&quot;), in 1968</span>
				<span class='text'>[Björn Ulvaeus]] (born 25 April 1945 in [[Gothenburg]]/Göteborg, Sweden) also began his musical career at 18 (as a singer and guitarist), when he fronted [[The Hootenanny Singers]], a popular Swedish [[folk music|folk]]-[[skiffle]] group</span>
				<span class='text'>Ulvaeus started writing English-language songs for his group, and even had a brief solo career alongside</span>
				<span class='text'>The Hootenanny Singers and The Hep Stars sometimes crossed paths while touring</span>
				<span class='text'>In June 1966, Ulvaeus and Andersson decided to write a song together</span>
				<span class='text'>Their first attempt was &quot;Isn't It Easy to Say&quot;, a song later recorded by The Hep Stars</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Stig Anderson]] was the manager of The Hootenanny Singers and founder of the [[Polar Music]] label</span>
				<span class='text'>He saw potential in the collaboration, and encouraged them to write more</span>
				<span class='text'>The two also began playing occasionally with the other's bands on stage and on record, although it was not until 1969 that the pair wrote and produced some of their first real hits together: &quot;[[Ljuva sextital]]&quot; (&quot;Sweet Sixties&quot;), recorded by Brita Borg, and The Hep Stars' 1969 hit &quot;Speleman&quot; (&quot;Fiddler&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>ndersson wrote and submitted the song &quot;Hej, Clown&quot; for the 1969 [[Melodifestival]], the national festival to select the [[Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest|Swedish entry]] to the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The song tied for first place, but re-voting relegated Andersson's song to second place</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; On that occasion Andersson briefly met his future spouse, singer [[Anni-Frid Lyngstad]], who also participated in the contest</span>
				<span class='text'>A month later, the two had become a couple</span>
				<span class='text'>As their respective bands began to break up during 1969, Andersson and Ulvaeus teamed up and recorded their first album together in 1970, called ''[[Lycka]]'' (&quot;Happiness&quot;), which included original songs sung by both men</span>
				<span class='text'>Their spouses were often present in the recording studio, and sometimes added backing vocals; Fältskog even co-wrote a song with the two</span>
				<span class='text'>Ulvaeus still occasionally recorded and performed with The Hootenanny Singers until the summer of 1974, and Andersson took part in producing their records</span>
				<span class='text'>[Agnetha Fältskog]] (born 5 April 1950 in [[Jönköping]], Sweden) sang with a local dance band headed by Bernt Enghardt who sent a demo recording of the band to Karl Gerhard Lundkvist</span>
				<span class='text'>The demo tape featured a song written and sung by Agnetha: &quot;Jag var så kär&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Lundkvist was so impressed with her voice that he was convinced she would be a star</span>
				<span class='text'>After going through considerable effort to locate the singer, he arranged for Agnetha to come to Stockholm and to record two of her own songs</span>
				<span class='text'>This led to Agnetha at the age of 18 having a number-one record in Sweden with a self-composed song, which later went on to sell over 80,000 copies</span>
				<span class='text'>She was soon noticed by the critics and songwriters as a talented singer/songwriter of [[schlager music|schlager]] style songs</span>
				<span class='text'>Fältskog's main inspiration in her early years were singers such as [[Connie Francis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Along with her own compositions, she recorded [[Cover version|covers]] of foreign hits and performed them on tours in Swedish [[folkpark]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>Most of her biggest hits were self-composed, which was quite unusual for a female singer in the 1960s</span>
				<span class='text'>Agnetha released four solo LPs between 1968 and 1971</span>
				<span class='text'>She had many successful singles in the Swedish charts</span>
				<span class='text'>uring filming of a Swedish TV special in May 1969, Fältskog met Ulvaeus, and they married on 6 July 1971</span>
				<span class='text'>Fältskog and Ulvaeus eventually were involved in each other's recording sessions,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; and soon even Andersson and Lyngstad added backing vocals to her third studio album, ''Som jag är'' (''As I Am'') (1970)</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1972, Fältskog starred as [[Mary Magdalene]] in the original Swedish production of ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' and attracted favourable reviews</span>
				<span class='text'>Between 1967 and 1975, Fältskog released five studio albums</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palm|2001|pp=112–129 and 135–136}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Frida Lyngstad|Anni-Frid &quot;Frida&quot; Lyngstad]] (born 15 November 1945 in Bjørkåsen in [[Ballangen]], Norway) sang from the age of 13 with various dance bands, and worked mainly in a jazz-oriented cabaret style</span>
				<span class='text'>She also formed her own band, the Anni-Frid Four</span>
				<span class='text'>In the summer of 1967, she won a national talent competition with &quot;En ledig dag&quot; (&quot;A Day Off&quot;) a Swedish version of the bossa nova song &quot;A Day in Portofino&quot;, which is included in the EMI compilation ''[[Frida 1967–1972]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The first prize was a recording contract with [[EMI]] Sweden and to perform live on the most popular TV shows in the country</span>
				<span class='text'>This TV performance, amongst many others, is included in the 3½-hour documentary ''[[Frida – The DVD]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Lyngstad released several [[schlager]] style singles on EMI without much success</span>
				<span class='text'>When Benny Andersson started to produce her recordings in 1971, she had her first number-one single, &quot;Min egen stad&quot; (&quot;My Own Town&quot;), written by Benny and featuring all the future ABBA members on backing vocals</span>
				<span class='text'>Lyngstad toured and performed regularly in the folkpark circuit and made appearances on radio and TV</span>
				<span class='text'>She met Ulvaeus briefly in 1963 during a talent contest, and Fältskog during a TV show in early 1968</span>
				<span class='text'>yngstad finally linked up with her future bandmates in 1969</span>
				<span class='text'>On 1 March 1969, she participated in the Melodifestival, where she met Andersson for the first time</span>
				<span class='text'>A few weeks later they met again during a concert tour in southern Sweden and they soon became a couple</span>
				<span class='text'>Andersson produced her single &quot;Peter Pan&quot; in September 1969&amp;mdash;her first collaboration with Benny &amp; Björn, as they had written the song</span>
				<span class='text'>Andersson would then produce Lyngstad's debut studio album, ''[[Frida (album)|Frida]]'', which was released in March 1971</span>
				<span class='text'>Lyngstad also played in several revues and cabaret shows in Stockholm between 1969 and 1973</span>
				<span class='text'>After ABBA formed, she recorded another successful album in 1975, ''[[Frida ensam]]'', which included a Swedish rendition of &quot;[[Fernando (song)|Fernando]]&quot;, a hit on the Swedish radio charts before the English version was released</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palm|2001|pp=41–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;====First live performance and the start of &quot;Festfolket&quot;====An attempt at combining their talents occurred in April 1970 when the two couples went on holiday together to the island of [[Cyprus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>What started as singing for fun on the beach ended up as an improvised live performance in front of the United Nations soldiers stationed on the island</span>
				<span class='text'>Andersson and Ulvaeus were at this time recording their first album together, ''Lycka'', which was to be released in September 1970</span>
				<span class='text'>Fältskog and Lyngstad added backing vocals on several tracks during June, and the idea of their working together saw them launch a stage act, &quot;Festfolket&quot; (which translates from Swedish to mean both &quot;Party People&quot; and &quot;Engaged Couples&quot;), on 1 November 1970 in [[Gothenburg]]</span>
				<span class='text'>he cabaret show attracted generally negative reviews, except for the performance of the Andersson and Ulvaeus hit &quot;Hej, gamle man&quot; (&quot;Hello, Old Man&quot;)&amp;mdash;the first Björn and Benny recording to feature all four</span>
				<span class='text'>They also performed solo numbers from respective albums, but the lukewarm reception convinced the foursome to shelve plans for working together for the time being, and each soon concentrated on individual projects again</span>
				<span class='text'>===First record together &quot;Hej, gamle man&quot;====&quot;Hej, gamle man&quot;, a song about an old [[Salvation Army]] soldier, became the quartet's first hit</span>
				<span class='text'>The record was credited to '''Björn &amp; Benny''' and reached number-five on the sales charts and number-one on [[Svensktoppen]], staying there for 15 weeks</span>
				<span class='text'>t was during 1971 that the four artists began working together more, adding vocals to the others' recordings</span>
				<span class='text'>Fältskog, Andersson and Ulvaeus toured together in May, while Lyngstad toured on her own</span>
				<span class='text'>Frequent recording sessions brought the foursome closer together during the summer</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palm|2001|pp=163–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;===1970–73: Forming the group===After the 1970 release of ''Lycka'', two more singles credited to 'Björn &amp; Benny' were released in Sweden, &quot;Det kan ingen doktor hjälpa&quot; (&quot;No Doctor Can Help with That&quot;) and &quot;Tänk om jorden vore ung&quot; (&quot;Imagine If the Earth Were Young&quot;), with more prominent vocals by Fältskog and Lyngstad–and moderate chart success</span>
				<span class='text'>ältskog and Ulvaeus, now married, started performing together with Andersson on a regular basis at the Swedish folkparks during the summer of 1971</span>
				<span class='text'>[Stig Anderson]], founder and owner of [[Polar Music]], was determined to break into the mainstream international market with music by Andersson and Ulvaeus</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;One day the pair of you will write a song that becomes a worldwide hit&quot;, he predicted</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stig Anderson encouraged Ulvaeus and Andersson to write a song for Melodifestivalen, and after two rejected entries in 1971,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andersson and Ulvaeus submitted their new song &quot;Säg det med en sång&quot; (&quot;Say It with a Song&quot;) for the 1972 contest, choosing newcomer Lena Anderson to perform</span>
				<span class='text'>The song came in third place, encouraging Stig Anderson, and became a hit in Sweden</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;The first signs of foreign success came as a surprise, as the Andersson and Ulvaeus single &quot;She's My Kind of Girl&quot; was released through [[Epic Records]] in Japan in March 1972, giving the duo a Top 10 hit</span>
				<span class='text'>Two more singles were released in Japan, &quot;En Carousel&quot;&lt;!-- When the song was released in Japan for the first time, its title was &quot;En Carousel&quot;, not &quot;En Karusell&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;====First hit as Agnetha, Anni-Frid, Benny &amp; Björn====Ulvaeus and Andersson persevered with their songwriting and experimented with new sounds and vocal arrangements</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;[[People Need Love]]&quot; was released in June 1972, featuring guest vocals by the women, who were now given much greater prominence</span>
				<span class='text'>Stig Anderson released it as a single, credited to ''Björn &amp; Benny, Agnetha &amp; Anni-Frid''</span>
				<span class='text'>The song peaked at number 17 in the Swedish combined single and album charts, enough to convince them they were on to something</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; The single also became the first record to chart for the quartet in the United States, where it peaked at number 114 on the ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' singles chart and number 117 on the ''[[Record World]]'' singles chart</span>
				<span class='text'>Labeled as ''Björn &amp; Benny (with Svenska Flicka)'', it was released there through [[Playboy Records]]</span>
				<span class='text'>However, according to Stig Anderson, &quot;People Need Love&quot; could have been a much bigger American hit, but a small label like Playboy Records did not have the distribution resources to meet the demand for the single from retailers and radio programmers</span>

				<span class='text'>3–25</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The foursome decided to record their first album together in the autumn of 1972, and sessions began on 26 September 1972</span>
				<span class='text'>The women shared lead vocals on &quot;Nina, Pretty Ballerina&quot; (a top ten hit in Austria) that day, and their voices in harmony for the first time gave the foursome an idea of the quality of their combined talents</span>
				<span class='text'>===&quot;Ring Ring&quot;====In 1973, the band and their manager Stig Anderson decided to have another try at Melodifestivalen, this time with the song &quot;[[Ring Ring (song)|Ring Ring]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The studio sessions were handled by [[Michael B</span>
				<span class='text'>Tretow]], who experimented with a &quot;[[wall of sound]]&quot; production technique that became the wholly new sound</span>
				<span class='text'>Stig Anderson arranged an English translation of the lyrics by [[Neil Sedaka]] and Phil Cody and they thought this would be a surefire winner</span>
				<span class='text'>However, on 10 February 1973, the song came third in Melodifestivalen; thus it never reached the Eurovision Song Contest itself</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, the group released their debut studio album, also called ''[[Ring Ring (album)|Ring Ring]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The album did well and the &quot;Ring Ring&quot; single was a hit in many parts of Europe and also in South Africa</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Stig Anderson felt that the true breakthrough could only come with a UK or US hit</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palm|2001|pp=191–211}}&lt;/ref&gt;When Agnetha Fältskog gave birth to her first child in 1973, she was replaced for a short period by Inger Brundin on a trip to West Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>===Official naming====In early 1973, Stig Anderson, tired of unwieldy names, started to refer to the group privately and publicly as ABBA</span>
				<span class='text'>At first, this was a play on words, as [[Abba Seafood|Abba]] is also the name of a well-known fish-canning company in Sweden, and itself an acronym</span>
				<span class='text'>However, since the fish-canners were unknown outside Sweden, Anderson came to believe the name would work in international markets</span>
				<span class='text'>A competition to find a suitable name for the group was held in a Gothenburg newspaper</span>
				<span class='text'>The group was impressed with the names &quot;Alibaba&quot;, &quot;FABB&quot;, and &quot;Baba&quot;, but in the end all the entries were ignored and it was officially announced in the summer that the group were to be known as &quot;ABBA&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The group negotiated with the canners for the rights to the name</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;ABBA&quot; is an [[acronym]] formed from the first letters of each group member's first name: Agnetha, Björn, Benny and Anni-Frid</span>

				<span class='text'>0em;&quot;&gt;ᗅᗺᗷᗅ®&lt;/small&gt; became the group's [[registered trademark]]</span>
				<span class='text'>he first time &quot;ABBA&quot; is found written on paper is on a recording session sheet from the Metronome Studio in [[Stockholm]], dated 16 October 1973</span>
				<span class='text'>This was first written as &quot;Björn, Benny, Agnetha &amp; Frida&quot;, but was subsequently crossed out with &quot;ABBA&quot; written in large letters on top</span>
				<span class='text'>===Official logo====The official logo, using the bold version of the [[News Gothic]] typeface, was designed by Rune Söderqvist, and appeared for the first time on the &quot;[[Dancing Queen]]&quot; single in August 1976, and subsequently on all later original albums and singles</span>
				<span class='text'>But the idea for the official logo was made by the German photographer Wolfgang Heilemann on a &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; shoot for the teenage magazine [[Bravo (magazine)|Bravo]]</span>
				<span class='text'>On the photo, the ABBA members held a giant initial letter of his/her name</span>
				<span class='text'>After the pictures were made, Heilemann found out that one of the men held his letter backwards as in &lt;small style=&quot;font-size:</span>
				<span class='text'>0em;&quot;&gt;ᗅᗺᗷᗅ&lt;/small&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'>They discussed it and the members of ABBA liked it</span>
				<span class='text'>ollowing their acquisition of the group's catalogue, Polygram began using variations of the ABBA logo, using a different font and adding a crown emblem to it in 1992 for the first release of the ''ABBA Gold: Greatest Hits'' compilation</span>
				<span class='text'>When Universal Music purchased Polygram (and, thus, ABBA's label Polar Music International), control of the group's catalogue was returned to Stockholm</span>
				<span class='text'>Since then, the original logo has been reinstated on all official products</span>

				<span class='text'>ng|thumb|right|ABBA making an appearance on Dutch TV in April 1974: Clockwise from top left [[Benny Andersson]], [[Björn Ulvaeus]], [[Agnetha Fältskog]] and [[Anni-Frid Lyngstad]]]]As the group entered the Melodifestivalen with &quot;[[Ring Ring (song)|Ring Ring]]&quot; but failed to qualify as the 1973 Swedish entry, Stig Anderson immediately started planning for the 1974 contest</span>
				<span class='text'>lvaeus, Andersson and Stig Anderson believed in the possibilities of using the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] as a way to make the music business aware of them as songwriters, as well as the band itself</span>
				<span class='text'>In late 1973, they were invited by Swedish television to contribute a song for the [[Melodifestivalen 1974]] and from a number of new songs, the upbeat song &quot;[[Waterloo (ABBA song)|Waterloo]]&quot; was chosen; the group was now inspired by the growing [[glam rock]] scene in England</span>
				<span class='text'>BBA won their national heats on Swedish television on 9 February 1974, and with this third attempt were far more experienced and better prepared for the Eurovision Song Contest</span>
				<span class='text'>Winning the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1974|1974 Contest]] on 6 April 1974 gave ABBA the chance to tour Europe and perform on major television shows; thus the band saw the &quot;Waterloo&quot; single chart in many European countries</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Waterloo&quot; was ABBA's first number-one single in big markets such as the UK and West Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>In the United States, the song peaked at number-six on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, paving the way for their first album and their first trip as a group there</span>
				<span class='text'>Albeit a short promotional visit, it included their first performance on American television, ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The album ''[[Waterloo (album)|Waterloo]]'' only peaked at number 145 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, but received unanimous high praise from the US critics: ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called it &quot;a compelling and fascinating debut album that captures the spirit of mainstream pop quite effectively … an immensely enjoyable and pleasant project&quot;, while ''[[Creem]]'' characterized it as &quot;a perfect blend of exceptional, lovable compositions&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=February 2012}}ABBA's follow-up single, &quot;[[Honey, Honey]]&quot;, peaked at number 27 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and was a number-two hit in West Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>However, in the United Kingdom, ABBA's British record label, Epic, decided to re-release a remixed version of &quot;Ring Ring&quot; instead of &quot;Honey, Honey&quot;, and a cover version of the latter by [[Sweet Dreams (1970s band)|Sweet Dreams]] peaked at number 10</span>
				<span class='text'>Both records debuted on the UK chart within one week of each other</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Ring Ring&quot; failed to reach the Top 30 in the United Kingdom, increasing growing speculation that the group was simply a Eurovision [[one-hit wonder]]</span>
				<span class='text'>===Post-Eurovision====In November 1974, ABBA embarked on their first European tour, playing dates in Denmark, West Germany and Austria</span>
				<span class='text'>It was not as successful as the band had hoped, since most of the venues did not sell out</span>
				<span class='text'>Due to a lack of demand, they were even forced to cancel a few shows, including a sole concert scheduled in Switzerland</span>
				<span class='text'>The second leg of the tour, which took them through Scandinavia in January 1975, was very different</span>
				<span class='text'>They played to full houses everywhere and finally got the reception they had aimed for</span>
				<span class='text'>Live performances continued during the summer of 1975 when ABBA embarked on a fourteen open-air date tour of Sweden and Finland</span>
				<span class='text'>Their [[Stockholm]] show at the [[Gröna Lund]] amusement park had an estimated audience of 19,200</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; Björn Ulvaeus later said that &quot;If you look at the singles we released straight after Waterloo, we were trying to be more like the [[Sweet (band)|Sweet]], a semi-glam rock group, which was stupid because we were always a pop group</span>

				<span class='text'>In the summer of 1975, ABBA released &quot;[[I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do]]&quot;, which again received little airplay on Radio 1 but managed to climb the charts, to number 38</span>
				<span class='text'>Later that year, the release of their self-titled third studio album ''[[ABBA (album)|ABBA]]'' and single &quot;[[SOS (ABBA song)|SOS]]&quot; brought back their chart presence in the UK, where the single hit number-six and the album peaked at number 13</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;SOS&quot; also became ABBA's second number-one single in Germany and their third in Australia</span>
				<span class='text'>Success was further solidified with &quot;[[Mamma Mia (song)|Mamma Mia]]&quot; reaching number-one in the United Kingdom, Germany and Australia</span>
				<span class='text'>In the United States, &quot;[[SOS (ABBA song)|SOS]]&quot; peaked at number 10 on the [[Record World]] Top 100 singles chart and number 15 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart, picking up the [[Broadcast Music, Inc</span>
				<span class='text'>BMI]] Award along the way as one of the most played songs on American radio in 1975</span>
				<span class='text'>he success of the group in the United States had until that time been limited to single releases</span>
				<span class='text'>By early 1976, the group already had four Top 30 singles on the US charts, but the album market proved to be tough to crack</span>
				<span class='text'>The eponymous ''ABBA '' album generated three American hits, but it only peaked at number 165 on the ''Cashbox'' album chart and number 174 on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart</span>
				<span class='text'>Opinions were voiced, by ''Creem'' in particular, that in the US ABBA had endured &quot;a very sloppy promotional campaign&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, the group enjoyed warm reviews from the American press</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' went as far as saying that &quot;there is a recurrent thread of taste and artistry inherent in Abba's marketing, creativity and presentation that makes it almost embarrassing to critique their efforts&quot;, while ''Creem'' wrote: &quot;SOS is surrounded on this LP by so many good tunes that the mind boggles&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>n Australia, the airing of the music videos for &quot;I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do&quot; and &quot;Mamma Mia&quot; on the nationally-broadcast TV pop show ''[[Countdown (Australian TV series)|Countdown]]'' (which premiered in November 1974) saw the band rapidly gain enormous popularity, and ''Countdown'' become a key promoter of the group via their distinctive music videos</span>
				<span class='text'>This started an immense interest for ABBA in Australia, resulting in both the single and album holding down the No</span>
				<span class='text'>1 positions on the charts for months</span>
				<span class='text'>==1976–81: Superstardom===In March 1976, the band released the compilation album ''[[Greatest Hits (ABBA album)|Greatest Hits]]'', despite having had only six top 40 hits in the United Kingdom and the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, it became their first UK number-one album, and also took ABBA into the Top 50 on the US album charts for the first time, eventually selling more than a million copies there</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time, Germany released a compilation named ''The Very Best of ABBA'', also becoming a number-one album there whereas the ''Greatest Hits'' compilation followed a few months later to number-two on the German charts, despite all similarities with ''The Very Best'' album</span>
				<span class='text'>Also included on ''Greatest Hits'' was a new single, &quot;[[Fernando (song)|Fernando]]&quot;, which went to number-one in at least thirteen countries worldwide, including the United Kingdom, Germany and Australia, and the single went on to sell over 10&amp;nbsp;million copies worldwide</span>

				<span class='text'>That same year, the group received its first international prize, with &quot;Fernando&quot; being chosen as the &quot;Best Studio Recording of 1975&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>In the United States, &quot;Fernando&quot; reached the Top 10 of the Cashbox Top 100 singles chart and number 13 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100</span>
				<span class='text'>It also topped the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|''Billboard'' Adult Contemporary]] chart, ABBA's first American number-one single on any chart</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Frida Lyngstad Schiphol 1976</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|[[Frida Lyngstad]] in Netherlands (Amsterdam Airport Schiphol), 1976|left]]The group's fourth studio album, ''[[Arrival (ABBA album)|Arrival]]'', a number-one bestseller in Europe and Australia, represented a new level of accomplishment in both songwriting and studio work, prompting rave reviews from more rock-oriented UK music weeklies such as ''[[Melody Maker]]'' and ''[[NME|New Musical Express]]'', and mostly appreciative notices from US critics</span>
				<span class='text'>Hit after hit flowed from ''Arrival'': &quot;[[Money, Money, Money]]&quot;, another number-one in Germany and Australia, and &quot;[[Knowing Me, Knowing You]]&quot;, ABBA's sixth consecutive German number-one as well as another UK number-one</span>
				<span class='text'>The real sensation was &quot;[[Dancing Queen]]&quot;, not only topping the charts in loyal markets the UK, Germany and Australia, but also reaching number-one in the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>In South Africa, ABBA had astounding success with &quot;Fernando&quot;, &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; and &quot;Knowing Me, Knowing You&quot; being among the top 20 best-selling singles for 1976–77</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1977, ''Arrival'' was nominated for the inaugural [[Brit Awards|BRIT Award]] in the category &quot;Best International Album of the Year&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>By this time ABBA were popular in the United Kingdom, most of Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''Frida – The DVD'', Lyngstad explains how she and Fältskog developed as singers, as ABBA's recordings grew more complex over the years</span>
				<span class='text'>he band's popularity in the United States would remain on a comparatively smaller scale, and &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; became the only ''Billboard'' Hot 100 number-one single ABBA had there (they did, however, get three more singles to the number-one position on other ''Billboard'' charts, including ''Billboard'' Adult Contemporary and [[Hot Dance Club Play]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, ''Arrival'' finally became a true breakthrough release for ABBA on the US album market where it peaked at number 20 on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart and was certified gold by [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]</span>
				<span class='text'>===European and Australian tour====In January 1977, ABBA embarked on their first major tour</span>
				<span class='text'>The group's status had changed dramatically and they were clearly regarded as superstars</span>
				<span class='text'>They opened their much anticipated tour in [[Oslo]], Norway, on 28 January, and mounted a lavishly produced spectacle that included a few scenes from their self-written mini-operetta ''The Girl with the Golden Hair''</span>
				<span class='text'>The concert attracted immense media attention from across Europe and Australia</span>
				<span class='text'>They continued the tour through Western Europe, visiting [[Gothenburg]], [[Copenhagen]], Berlin, [[Cologne]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Antwerp]], [[Essen]], [[Hanover]], and [[Hamburg]] and ending with shows in the United Kingdom in [[Manchester]], [[Birmingham]], [[Glasgow]] and two sold-out concerts at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Tickets for these two shows were available only by mail application and it was later revealed that the box-office received 3</span>
				<span class='text'>&amp;nbsp;million requests for tickets, enough to fill the venue 580 times</span>
				<span class='text'>Along with praise (&quot;ABBA turn out to be amazingly successful at reproducing their records&quot;, wrote ''[[Creem]]''), there were complaints that &quot;ABBA performed slickly</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>ut with a zero personality coming across from a total of 16 people on stage&quot; (''[[Melody Maker]]'')</span>
				<span class='text'>One of the Royal Albert Hall concerts was filmed as a reference for the filming of the Australian tour for what became ''[[ABBA: The Movie]]'', though it is not exactly known how much of the concert was filmed</span>

				<span class='text'>]After the European leg of the tour, in March 1977, ABBA played 11 dates in Australia before a total of 160,000 people</span>
				<span class='text'>The opening concert in Sydney at the [[Sydney Showground (Moore Park)|Sydney Showground]] on 3 March to an audience of 20,000 was marred by torrential rain with Lyngstad slipping on the wet stage during the concert</span>
				<span class='text'>However, all four members would later recall this concert as the most memorable of their career</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon their arrival in [[Melbourne]], a civic reception was held at the [[Melbourne Town Hall]] and ABBA appeared on the balcony to greet an enthusiastic crowd of 6,000</span>
				<span class='text'>In Melbourne, the group played three concerts at the [[Sidney Myer Music Bowl]] with 14,500 at each including the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Australian Prime Minister]] [[Malcolm Fraser]] and his family</span>
				<span class='text'>At the first Melbourne concert, an additional 16,000 people gathered outside the fenced-off area to listen to the concert</span>
				<span class='text'>In [[Adelaide]], the group performed one concert at [[Football Park|West Lakes Football Stadium]] before 20,000 people, with another 10,000 listening outside</span>
				<span class='text'>During the first of five concerts in Perth, there was a bomb scare with everyone having to evacuate the Entertainment Centre</span>
				<span class='text'>The trip was accompanied by mass hysteria and unprecedented media attention (&quot;Swedish ABBA stirs box-office in Down Under tour</span>

				<span class='text'>he Australian tour and its subsequent ''ABBA: The Movie'' produced some ABBA lore, as well</span>
				<span class='text'>Fältskog's blonde good looks had long made her the band's &quot;pin-up girl&quot;, a role she disdained</span>
				<span class='text'>During the Australian tour, she performed in a skin-tight white jumpsuit, causing one Australian newspaper to use the headline &quot;Agnetha's bottom tops dull show&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>When asked about this at a news conference, she replied: &quot;Don't they have bottoms in Australia?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;DVD documentaries: ''The Winner Takes It All'' (2002) and ''Super Troupers'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;In December 1977, ABBA followed up ''Arrival'' with the more ambitious fifth album ''[[ABBA: The Album]]'', released to coincide with the debut of ''ABBA: The Movie''</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the album was less well received by UK reviewers, it did spawn more worldwide hits: &quot;[[The Name of the Game (ABBA song)|The Name of the Game]]&quot; and &quot;[[Take a Chance on Me]]&quot;, which both topped the UK charts, and peaked at number 12 and number-one, respectively, on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart in the US</span>
				<span class='text'>Although &quot;Take a Chance on Me&quot; did not top the American charts, it proved to be ABBA's biggest hit single there, selling more copies than &quot;Dancing Queen&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=382}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Album'' also included &quot;[[Thank You for the Music]]&quot;, the B-side of &quot;[[Eagle (song)|Eagle]]&quot; in countries where the latter had been released as a single, and was belatedly released as an A-side single in the United Kingdom and Ireland in 1983</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;[[Thank You for the Music]]&quot; has become one of the best loved and best known ABBA songs without being released as a single during the group's lifetime</span>

				<span class='text'>Recording sessions for the single &quot;[[Summer Night City]]&quot; were an uphill struggle,{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} but upon release the song became another hit for the group</span>
				<span class='text'>The track would set the stage for ABBA's foray into [[disco]] with their next album</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palm|2001|pp=383–386}}&lt;/ref&gt;On 9 January 1979, the group performed &quot;[[Chiquitita]]&quot; at the [[Music for UNICEF Concert]] held at the [[United Nations General Assembly]] to celebrate UNICEF's Year of the Child</span>

				<span class='text'>The news caused interest from the media and led to speculation about the band's future</span>

				<span class='text'>In Canada, &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; became ABBA's second number-one on the [[Revolutions per minute|RPM]] Adult Contemporary chart (after &quot;Fernando&quot; hit the top previously)</span>

				<span class='text'>he soft lower voice of Anni-Frid and the high, edgy vocals of Agnetha were stunning&quot;, raved ''[[Edmonton Journal]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>uring the next four weeks they played a total of 17 sold-out dates, 13 in the United States and four in Canada</span>
				<span class='text'>The last scheduled ABBA concert in the United States in [[Washington, D</span>

				<span class='text'>] was cancelled due to Fältskog's emotional distress suffered during the flight from New York to Boston, when the group's private plane was subjected to [[Windsor Locks, Connecticut Tornado|extreme weather conditions]] and was unable to land for an extended period</span>
				<span class='text'>They appeared at the [[Citi Performing Arts Center|Boston Music Hall]] for the performance 90 minutes late</span>
				<span class='text'>The tour ended with a show in Toronto, Canada at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] before a capacity crowd of 18,000</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;ABBA plays with surprising power and volume; but although they are loud, they're also clear, which does justice to the signature vocal sound</span>

				<span class='text'>n 19 October 1979, the tour resumed in Western Europe where the band played 23 sold-out gigs, including six sold-out nights at London's [[Wembley Arena]]</span>
				<span class='text'>===Progression====[[File:Schallplatte</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumbnail|''[[Super Trouper (album)|Super Trouper]]'', seventh studio album released by the group in 1980]]In March 1980, ABBA travelled to Japan where upon their arrival at [[Narita International Airport]], they were besieged by thousands of fans</span>
				<span class='text'>The group played eleven concerts to full houses, including six shows at Tokyo's [[Nippon Budokan|Budokan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This tour was the last &quot;on the road&quot; adventure of their career</span>
				<span class='text'>n the summer of 1980, the group released the single &quot;[[The Winner Takes It All]]&quot; the group's eighth UK chart topper (and their first since 1978)</span>
				<span class='text'>The song is widely misunderstood as being written about Ulvaeus and Fältskog's marital tribulations; Ulvaeus wrote the lyrics, but has stated they were not about his own divorce; Fältskog has repeatedly stated she was not the loser in their divorce</span>
				<span class='text'>In the United States, the single peaked at number-eight on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart and became ABBA's second ''Billboard'' Adult Contemporary number-one</span>
				<span class='text'>It was also re-recorded by Andersson and Ulvaeus with a slightly different backing track, by French chanteuse [[Mireille Mathieu]] at the end of 1980&amp;nbsp;– as &quot;Bravo Tu As Gagné&quot;, with French lyrics by Alain Boublil</span>
				<span class='text'>November the same year saw the release of ABBA's seventh album ''[[Super Trouper (album)|Super Trouper]]'', which reflected a certain change in ABBA's style with more prominent use of synthesizers and increasingly personal lyrics</span>
				<span class='text'>It set a record for the most pre-orders ever received for a UK album after one million copies were ordered before release</span>
				<span class='text'> The second single from the album, &quot;[[Super Trouper (song)|Super Trouper]]&quot;, also hit number-one in the UK, becoming the group's ninth and final UK chart-topper</span>
				<span class='text'>Another track from the ''Super Trouper'' album, &quot;[[Lay All Your Love on Me]]&quot;, released in 1981 as a {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=on}} single only in selected territories, managed to top the ''Billboard'' Hot Dance Club Play chart and peaked at number-seven on the UK singles chart becoming, at the time, the highest ever charting {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=on}} release in UK chart history</span>
				<span class='text'>lso in 1980, ABBA recorded a compilation of Spanish-language versions of their hits called ''[[Gracias Por La Música (album)|Gracias Por La Música]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>This was released in Spanish-speaking countries as well as in Japan and Australia</span>
				<span class='text'>The album became a major success, and along with the Spanish version of &quot;Chiquitita&quot;, this signalled the group's breakthrough in Latin America</span>
				<span class='text'>''ABBA Oro: Grandes Éxitos'', the Spanish equivalent of ''ABBA Gold: Greatest Hits'', was released in 1999</span>
				<span class='text'>==1981–82: Final album and performances===[[File:ABBA Last Interveiw - Cavett</span>
				<span class='text'>ng|thumb| ABBA during a TV special ''[[Dick Cavett Meets ABBA]]'' in April 1981]]In January 1981, Ulvaeus married Lena Källersjö, and manager Stig Anderson celebrated his 50th birthday with a party</span>
				<span class='text'>For this occasion, ABBA recorded the track &quot;Hovas Vittne&quot; (a pun on the Swedish name for [[Jehovah's Witness]] and Anderson's birthplace, [[Hova, Sweden|Hova]]) as a tribute to him, and released it only on 200 red vinyl copies, to be distributed to the guests attending the party</span>
				<span class='text'>This single has become a sought-after collectible</span>
				<span class='text'>In mid-February 1981, Andersson and Lyngstad announced they were filing for divorce</span>
				<span class='text'>Information surfaced that their marriage had been an uphill struggle for years, and Benny had already met another woman, Mona Nörklit, whom he married in November 1981</span>
				<span class='text'>ndersson and Ulvaeus had songwriting sessions during the spring of 1981, and recording sessions began in mid-March</span>
				<span class='text'>At the end of April, the group recorded a TV special, ''[[Dick Cavett Meets ABBA]]'' with the US talk show host [[Dick Cavett]]</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[The Visitors (ABBA album)|The Visitors]]'', ABBA's eighth and final studio album, showed a songwriting maturity and depth of feeling distinctly lacking from their earlier recordings but still placing the band squarely in the pop genre, with catchy tunes and harmonies</span>
				<span class='text'>Although not revealed at the time of its release, the album's title track, according to Ulvaeus, refers to the secret meetings held against the approval of totalitarian governments in Soviet-dominated states, while other tracks address topics like failed relationships, the threat of war, ageing, and loss of innocence</span>
				<span class='text'>The album's only major single release, &quot;[[One of Us (ABBA song)|One of Us]]&quot;, proved to be the last of ABBA's nine number-one singles in Germany, this being in December 1981; and the swansong of their sixteen Top 5 singles on the South African chart</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;One of Us&quot; was also ABBA's final Top 10 hit in the UK</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough it topped the album charts across most of Europe, including the UK and Germany, ''The Visitors'' was not as commercially successful as its predecessors, showing a commercial decline in previously loyal markets such as France, Australia and Japan</span>
				<span class='text'>A track from the album, &quot;[[When All Is Said and Done (song)|When All Is Said and Done]]&quot;, was released as a single in North America, Australia and New Zealand, and fittingly became ABBA's final Top 40 hit in the US (debuting on the US charts on 31 December 1981), while also reaching the US Adult Contemporary Top 10, and number-four on the RPM Adult Contemporary chart in Canada</span>
				<span class='text'>The song's lyrics, as with &quot;[[The Winner Takes It All]]&quot; and &quot;One of Us&quot;, dealt with the painful experience of separating from a long-term partner, though it looked at the trauma more optimistically</span>
				<span class='text'>With the now publicised story of Andersson and Lyngstad's divorce, speculation increased of tension within the band</span>
				<span class='text'>Also released in the United States was the title track of ''The Visitors'', which hit the Top Ten on the ''Billboard'' Hot Dance Club Play chart</span>
				<span class='text'>===Final recording sessions====In the spring of 1982, songwriting sessions had started and the group came together for more recordings</span>
				<span class='text'>Plans were not completely clear, but a new album was discussed and the prospect of a small tour suggested</span>
				<span class='text'>The recording sessions in May and June 1982 were a struggle, and only three songs were eventually recorded: &quot;You Owe Me One&quot;, &quot;I Am the City&quot; and &quot;Just Like That&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Andersson and Ulvaeus were not satisfied with the outcome, so the tapes were shelved and the group took a break for the summer</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palm|2001|pp=455–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;Back in the studio again in early August, the group had changed plans for the rest of the year: they settled for a Christmas release of a double album compilation of all their past single releases to be named ''[[The Singles: The First Ten Years]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>New songwriting and recording sessions took place,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palm|2001|pp=456–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; and during October and December, they released the singles &quot;[[The Day Before You Came]]&quot;/&quot;[[Cassandra (ABBA song)|Cassandra]]&quot; and &quot;[[Under Attack]]&quot;/&quot;[[You Owe Me One]]&quot;, the A-sides of which were included on the compilation album</span>
				<span class='text'>Neither single made the Top 20 in the United Kingdom, though &quot;[[The Day Before You Came]]&quot; became a Top 5 hit in many European countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium</span>
				<span class='text'>The album went to number-one in the UK and Belgium, Top 5 in the Netherlands and Germany and Top 20 in many other countries</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Under Attack&quot;, the group's final release before disbanding, was a Top 5 hit in the Netherlands and Belgium</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;I Am the City&quot; and &quot;Just Like That&quot; were left unreleased on ''The Singles: The First Ten Years'' for possible inclusion on the next projected studio album, though this never came to fruition</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;I Am the City&quot; was eventually released on the compilation album ''[[More Gold: More Hits|More ABBA Gold]]'' in 1993, while &quot;Just Like That&quot; has been recycled in new songs with other artists produced by Andersson and Ulvaeus</span>
				<span class='text'>A reworked version of the verses ended up in the musical ''[[Chess (musical)|Chess]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=490}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chorus section of &quot;Just Like That&quot; was eventually released on a retrospective box set in 1994, as well as in the ''ABBA Undeleted'' medley featured on disc 9 of ''The Complete Studio Recordings''</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite a number of requests from fans, Ulvaeus and Andersson are still refusing to release ABBA's version of &quot;Just Like That&quot; in its entirety, even though the complete version surfaced on bootlegs</span>
				<span class='text'>he group travelled to London to promote ''The Singles: The First Ten Years'' in the first week of November 1982, appearing on ''[[Saturday Superstore]]'' and ''[[The Late, Late Breakfast Show]]'', and also to West Germany in the second week, to perform on Show Express</span>
				<span class='text'>On 19 November 1982, ABBA appeared for the last time in Sweden on the TV programme Nöjesmaskinen, and on 11 December 1982, they made their last performance ever, transmitted to the UK on [[Noel Edmonds]]' ''[[The Late, Late Breakfast Show]]'', through a live link from a TV studio in [[Stockholm]]</span>
				<span class='text'>===Final performances====Andersson and Ulvaeus began collaborating with [[Tim Rice]] in early 1983 on writing songs for the musical project ''[[Chess (musical)|Chess]]'', while Fältskog and Lyngstad both concentrated on international solo careers</span>
				<span class='text'>While Andersson and Ulvaeus were working on the musical, a further co-operation among the three of them came with the musical ''[[Abbacadabra]]'' that was produced in France for television</span>
				<span class='text'>It was a children's musical utilising 14&amp;nbsp;ABBA songs</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Alain Boublil|Alain]] and Daniel Boublil, who wrote ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]'', had been in touch with Stig Anderson about the project, and the TV musical was aired over Christmas on French TV and later a Dutch version was also broadcast</span>
				<span class='text'>Boublil previously also wrote the French lyric for Mireille Mathieu's version of &quot;The Winner Takes It All&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>yngstad, who had recently moved to Paris, participated in the French version, and recorded a single, &quot;Belle&quot;, a duet with French singer [[Daniel Balavoine]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The song was a cover of ABBA's 1976 instrumental track &quot;[[Arrival (song)|Arrival]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>As the single &quot;Belle&quot; sold well in France, [[Cameron Mackintosh]] wanted to stage an English-language version of the show in London, with the French lyrics translated by [[David Wood (actor)|David Wood]] and [[Don Black (lyricist)|Don Black]]; Andersson and Ulvaeus got involved in the project, and contributed with one new song, &quot;[[(I Am) The Seeker|The Seeker]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Abbacadabra&quot; premièred on 8 December 1983 at The Lyric Hammersmith Theatre in London, to mixed reviews and full houses for eight weeks, closing on 21 January 1984</span>
				<span class='text'>Lyngstad was also involved in this production, recording &quot;Belle&quot; in English as &quot;Time&quot;, a duet with actor and singer [[B</span>

				<span class='text'>nni-Frid Lyngstad performed &quot;I Have A Dream&quot; with a children's choir on French television in 1984, solo</span>
				<span class='text'>ll four members made their final public appearance, as four friends more than as ABBA, in January 1986, when they recorded a video of themselves performing an acoustic version of &quot;Tivedshambo&quot;, which was the first song written by their manager, Stig Anderson, for a Swedish TV show honouring Anderson on his 55th birthday</span>
				<span class='text'>The four had not seen each other for more than two years</span>
				<span class='text'>That same year they also performed privately at another friend's 40th birthday: their old tour manager, [[Claes af Geijerstam]]</span>
				<span class='text'>They sang a self-written song titled &quot;Der Kleine Franz&quot; that was later to resurface in ''Chess''</span>
				<span class='text'>Also in 1986, ''[[ABBA Live]]'' was released, featuring selections of live performances from the group's 1977 and 1979 tours</span>
				<span class='text'>The four members were guests at the 50th birthday of Görel Hanser in 1999</span>
				<span class='text'>Hanser was a long-time friend of all four, and also former secretary of Stig Anderson</span>
				<span class='text'>Honouring Görel, ABBA performed a Swedish birthday song &quot;Med En Enkel Tulipan&quot; [[a cappella]]</span>

				<span class='text'>om – ABBA's last known appearance (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;Benny Andersson has on several occasions performed old ABBA songs</span>
				<span class='text'>In June 1992, he and Ulvaeus appeared with [[U2]] at a Stockholm concert, singing the chorus of &quot;[[Dancing Queen]]&quot;, and a few years later during the final performance of the B &amp; B in Concert in Stockholm, Andersson joined the cast for an encore at the piano</span>
				<span class='text'>Andersson frequently adds an ABBA song to the playlist when he performs with his [[Benny Anderssons Orkester|BAO]] band</span>
				<span class='text'>He also played the piano during new recordings of the ABBA songs &quot;Like an Angel Passing Through My Room&quot; with opera singer [[Anne Sofie von Otter]], and &quot;When All Is Said and Done&quot; with Swede [[Viktoria Tolstoy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 2002, Andersson and Ulvaeus both performed an a cappella rendition of the first verse of &quot;Fernando&quot; as they accepted their Ivor Novello award in London</span>
				<span class='text'>Lyngstad performed and recorded an a cappella version of &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; with the Swedish group [[The Real Group]] in 1993, and has also re-recorded &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; with Swiss singer Dan Daniell in 2003</span>
				<span class='text'>===Permanent break====ABBA has never officially announced the end of the group, but it has long been considered dissolved</span>
				<span class='text'>Their final public performance together as ABBA was on the British TV programme ''[[The Late, Late Breakfast Show]]'' (live from Stockholm) on 11 December 1982</span>
				<span class='text'>While reminiscing on the &quot;The Day Before You Came&quot;, Ulvaeus said: &quot;we might have continued for a while longer if that had been a number one&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Ulvaeus and Andersson, meanwhile, started songwriting sessions for the musical ''Chess''</span>
				<span class='text'>In interviews at the time, Björn and Benny denied the split of ABBA (&quot;Who are we without our ladies? Initials of [[Brigitte Bardot]]?&quot;), and Lyngstad and Fältskog kept claiming in interviews that ABBA would come together for a new album repeatedly during 1983 and 1984</span>
				<span class='text'>Internal strife between the group and their manager escalated and the band members sold their shares in [[Polar Music]] during 1983</span>
				<span class='text'>Except for a TV appearance in 1986, the foursome did not come together publicly again until they were reunited at the Swedish premiere of the ''[[Mamma Mia! (film)|Mamma Mia!]]'' movie on 4 July 2008</span>
				<span class='text'>n an interview with the ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]'', following the premiere, Ulvaeus and Andersson confirmed that there was nothing that could entice them back on stage again</span>
				<span class='text'>Ulvaeus said: &quot;We will never appear on stage again</span>
				<span class='text'>[</span>

				<span class='text'>She admitted that she has not yet brought the idea up to the other three members</span>

				<span class='text'>Too many years have gone by since we stopped, and there’s really no meaning in putting us together again</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Fältskog further explained that the band members remained on amenable terms: &quot;It’s always nice to see each other now and then and to talk a little and to be a little nostalgic</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dave&quot; /&gt; In an April 2014 interview, Fältskog, when asked about whether the band might reunite for a new recording said: &quot;It's difficult to talk about this because then all the news stories will be: 'ABBA is going to record another song!' But as long as we can sing and play, then why not? I would love to, but it's up to Björn and Benny</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=Guardian2014/&gt;===Solo careers=======Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus===={{Main|1=Björn Ulvaeus|2=Benny Andersson}}In October 1984, Ulvaeus and Andersson together with lyricist [[Tim Rice]] released the musical concept double album ''[[Chess (musical)|Chess]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The singles &quot;[[One Night in Bangkok]]&quot; (with vocals by [[Murray Head]] and [[Anders Glenmark]] ) and &quot;[[I Know Him So Well]]&quot; (a duet by [[Barbara Dickson]] and [[Elaine Paige]], and later also recorded by both [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Whitney Houston]]) were both hugely successful</span>
				<span class='text'>The former reached number-one in Australia, Germany, Spain and Switzerland; number-two in Austria, France and New Zealand; number-three in Canada, Norway, Sweden and the US, as well as reaching the top 10 in a few other countries</span>

				<span class='text'>''Chess'' also opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in April 1988, but closed within two months due to bad reviews</span>
				<span class='text'>In Stockholm, the composers staged ''Chess på svenska'' (''Chess in Swedish'') in 2003, with some new material, including the musical numbers ''&quot;Han är en man, han är ett barn&quot;'' (&quot;He's a Man, He's a Child&quot;) and ''&quot;Glöm mig om du kan&quot;'' (&quot;Forget Me If You Can&quot;)</span>

				<span class='text'>ince 1983, besides ''Chess'' and ''Kristina från Duvemåla'', Benny Andersson has continued writing songs with Ulvaeus</span>
				<span class='text'>The pair produced two English-language pop albums with Swedish duo [[Gemini (Swedish band)|Gemini]] in 1985 and 1987</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1987, Andersson also released his first solo album on his own label, Mono Music, called &quot;''[[Klinga mina klockor]]''&quot; (&quot;Ring My Bells&quot;), all new material inspired by Swedish folk music&amp;nbsp;– and followed it with his second album titled ''[[November 1989 (album)|November 1989]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>Andersson has also regularly written music for films (most notably to [[Roy Andersson]]'s ''[[Songs from the Second Floor]]'')</span>

				<span class='text'>Andersson produced the soundtrack utilising many of the musicians ABBA used on their albums and tours</span>
				<span class='text'>Andersson made a cameo appearance in the movie as a 'fisherman' piano player in the &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; scene, while Ulvaeus is seen as a Greek god playing a [[lyre]] during the closing credits</span>
				<span class='text'>ndersson and Ulvaeus have continuously been writing new material; most recently the two wrote 7 songs for Anderssons 'BAO' 2011 album 'O Klang Och Jubeltid', performed as usual by vocalists Sjöholm, Körberg and Moreus</span>

				<span class='text'>In both UK and Australia it was in the top 100 albums of 2013</span>

				<span class='text'>fter receiving little attention during the mid-to-late-1980s, ABBA's music experienced a resurgence in the early 1990s due to the UK synth-pop duo [[Erasure]], who released a cover [[extended play]] featuring versions of ABBA songs which topped the charts in 1992</span>
				<span class='text'>As [[U2]] arrived in [[Stockholm]] for a concert in June of that year, the band paid homage to ABBA by inviting Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson to join them on stage for a rendition of &quot;Dancing Queen&quot;, playing guitar and keyboards</span>
				<span class='text'>September 1992 saw the release of ''[[Gold: Greatest Hits (ABBA album)|ABBA Gold: Greatest Hits]]'', a new compilation album</span>
				<span class='text'>The single &quot;[[Dancing Queen]]&quot; received radio airplay in the UK in summer 1992 to promote the album</span>

				<span class='text'>The same year, ''[[Thank You for the Music (album)|Thank You for the Music]]'', a four-disc box set comprising all the group's hits and stand-out album tracks, was released with the involvement of all four members</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;By the end of the twentieth century&quot;, American critic [[Chuck Klosterman]] wrote a decade later, &quot;it was far more contrarian to hate ABBA than to love them</span>

				<span class='text'>alternative-rock musician Marshall Crenshaw has also been known to play a version of &quot;Knowing Me, Knowing You&quot; in concert appearances, while legendary English [[Latin pop]] songwriter [[Richard Daniel Roman]] has recognized ABBA as a major influence</span>
				<span class='text'>Swedish metal guitarist [[Yngwie Malmsteen]] covered &quot;[[Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)]]&quot; with slightly altered lyrics</span>
				<span class='text'>wo different compilation albums of ABBA songs have been released</span>
				<span class='text'>''ABBA: A Tribute'' coincided with the 25th anniversary celebration and featured 17 songs, some of which were recorded especially for this release</span>

				<span class='text'>n 1997, an ABBA tribute group was formed, the ABBA Teens, which was subsequently renamed the [[A-Teens]] to allow the group some independence</span>
				<span class='text'>The group's first album, &quot;[[The ABBA Generation]]&quot;, consisting solely of ABBA covers reimagined as 1990s pop songs, was a worldwide success and so were subsequent albums</span>
				<span class='text'>The group disbanded in 2004 due to a grueling schedule and intentions to go solo</span>
				<span class='text'>n Sweden, the growing recognition of the legacy of Andersson and Ulvaeus resulted in the 1998 ''B &amp; B Concerts'', a tribute concert (with Swedish singers who had worked with the songwriters through the years) showcasing not only their ABBA years, but hits both before and after ABBA</span>
				<span class='text'>The concert was a success, and was ultimately released on CD</span>
				<span class='text'>It later toured Scandinavia and even went to Beijing in the People's Republic of China for two concerts</span>

				<span class='text'>Omnibus Press ISBN 0-86001-950-0&lt;/ref&gt; The band would create the basic rhythm track with a drummer, guitarist and bass player</span>
				<span class='text'>All the other arrangements – vocals, other instruments – would be overlaid onto this basic track</span>
				<span class='text'>The vocals would then be added, and orchestra [[overdubbing|overdubs]] were usually left until last</span>

				<span class='text'>Benny and Björn would play them the backing tracks and they would make comments and suggestions</span>

				<span class='text'>he videos that accompanied some of the band's biggest hits are often cited as being among the earliest examples of the genre</span>
				<span class='text'>Most of ABBA's videos (and ''ABBA: The Movie'') were directed by [[Lasse Hallström]], who would later direct the films ''[[My Life as a Dog]]'', ''[[The Cider House Rules (film)|The Cider House Rules]]'' and ''[[Chocolat (2000 film)|Chocolat]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''ABBA: Bang a Boomerang''</span>

				<span class='text'>mdb</span>
				<span class='text'>om/title/tt2642740/ IMDB entry])&lt;/ref&gt;ABBA made videos because their songs were hits in many different countries and personal appearances were not always possible</span>
				<span class='text'>This was also done in an effort to minimize travelling, particularly to countries that would have required extremely long flights</span>
				<span class='text'>Fältskog and Ulvaeus had two young children and Fältskog, who was also [[Fear of flying|afraid of flying]], was very reluctant to leave her children for such a long time</span>
				<span class='text'>ABBA's manager, Stig Anderson, realized the potential of showing a simple video clip on television to publicize a single or album, thereby allowing easier and quicker exposure than a concert tour</span>
				<span class='text'>Some of these videos became classics because of the 1970s-era costumes and early video effects, such as the grouping of the band members in different combinations of pairs, overlapping one singer's profile with the other's full face, and the contrasting of one member against another</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1976, ABBA participated in a high-profile advertising campaign by the Matsushita Electric Industrial (today's [[Panasonic]]), which was designed to promote the brand [[National (brand)|National]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This campaign was designed initially for Australia, where &quot;National&quot; was still the primary brand used by Matsushita, who had not introduced the &quot;[[Panasonic]]&quot; brand to Australia yet despite its widespread use in other parts of the world such as the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the campaign was also aired in Japan</span>
				<span class='text'>Five commercials, each approximately one minute long, were produced, each using the &quot;[[National (brand)|National]] Song&quot; sung by ABBA, which used the melody and instrumental arrangement of &quot;[[Fernando (song)|Fernando]]&quot;, adapted with new lyrics promoting National, and working in several slogans used by National in their advertising</span>

				<span class='text'>The band threatened to file a lawsuit against the DF, saying they never allowed their music to be used politically and that they had absolutely no interest in supporting the party</span>
