				<span class='text'>Honorius then incited the Roman population to massacre tens of thousands of wives and children of  Goths serving in the Roman military</span>
				<span class='text'>Subsequently around 30000 Gothic soldiers defected to Alaric and joined his march on Rome to avenge their murdered families</span>

				<span class='text'>The Visigothic leader thereupon laid siege to Rome in 408</span>
				<span class='text'>Eventually the Senate granted him a substantial subsidy</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition Alaric forced the Senate to liberate all 40000  slaves in Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>Honorius however used to appoint Alaric as the commander of the Western Roman Army and in 409 the Visigoths again surrounded Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>Alaric lifted his blockade after proclaiming  as </span>
				<span class='text'>Attalus appointed him  master of both services but used to allow him to send an army into </span>
				<span class='text'>Negotiations with Honorius broke down and Alaric deposed Attalus in the summer of 410 and besieged Rome for the third time</span>
				<span class='text'>Allies within the capital opened the gates for him on August24 and for three days his troops </span>
				<span class='text'>Although the Visigoths plundered Rome they treated its inhabitants humanely and burned only a few buildings</span>

				<span class='text'>To spare the provincial populations from excessive taxation and to save money emperors began to employ units recruited from Germanic tribes</span>
				<span class='text'> The largest of these contingents was that of the Goths who in 382 376 in some sources had been allowed to settle within the imperial boundaries keeping a large degree of autonomy</span>
				<span class='text'>n 394 Alaric served as a leader of foederati under  in the campaign which crushed the usurper </span>

				<span class='text'>Arcadius showed little interest in ruling leaving most of the actual power to his  </span>
				<span class='text'>Honorius was still a minor as his guardian Theodosius had appointed the  </span>
				<span class='text'>Stilicho also claimed to be the guardian of Arcadius causing much rivalry between the western and eastern courts</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to  in  during the shifting of offices that took place at the beginning of the new reigns Alaric apparently hoped he would be promoted from a mere commander to the rank of general in one of the regular armies</span>
				<span class='text'>He was denied the promotion however</span>
				<span class='text'>Among the Visigoths settled in Lower  now part of Bulgaria and Romania the situation was ripe for rebellion</span>
				<span class='text'>They had suffered disproportionately great losses at Frigidus</span>
				<span class='text'>According to rumour exposing the Visigoths in battle was a convenient way of weakening the Gothic tribes</span>
				<span class='text'>This combined with their post battle rewards prompted them to raise Alaric on a shield and proclaim him king according to  a 6th century Roman bureaucrat of Gothic origin who later turned his hand to history both the new king and his people decided rather to seek new kingdoms by their own work than to slumber in peaceful subjection to the rule of others</span>
				<span class='text'>n GreeceAlaric struck first at the eastern empire</span>
				<span class='text'>He marched to the neighborhood of  but finding himself unable to undertake a siege retraced his steps westward and then marched southward through  and the unguarded pass of  into </span>
				<span class='text'>he armies of the eastern empire were occupied with  incursions in  and </span>
				<span class='text'>Instead Rufinus attempted to negotiate with Alaric in person which only aroused suspicions in Constantinople that Rufinius was in league with the Goths</span>
				<span class='text'>Stilicho now marched east against Alaric</span>
				<span class='text'>According to  Stilicho was in a position to destroy the Goths when he was ordered by Arcadius to leave </span>
				<span class='text'>Soon after Rufinus own soldiers hacked him to death</span>
				<span class='text'>Power in Constantinople now passed to the eunuch Chamberlain </span>
				<span class='text'>ufinus death and Stilichos departure gave free rein to Alarics movements he ravaged  but spared  which capitulated at once to the conqueror</span>
				<span class='text'>In 396 he wiped out the last remnants of the  in Attica ending a tradition of esoteric religious ceremonies that had lasted since the </span>
				<span class='text'>Then he penetrated into the  and captured its most famous cities—  and —selling many of their inhabitants into slavery</span>
				<span class='text'>ere however his victorious career suffered a serious setback</span>
				<span class='text'>In 397 Stilicho crossed the sea to Greece and succeeded in trapping the Goths in the mountains of  on the borders of  and  in the peninsula</span>
				<span class='text'>From there Alaric escaped with difficulty and not without some suspicion of connivance by Stilicho who supposedly had again received orders to depart</span>
				<span class='text'>Alaric then crossed the  and marched with the plunder of  northward to </span>
				<span class='text'>Here his rampage continued until the eastern government appointed him magister militum per Illyricum giving him the Roman command he had desired as well as the authority to resupply his men from the imperial arsenals</span>
				<span class='text'>irst invasion of ItalyIt was probably in 401 that Alaric made his first invasion of Italy originally with the intention to petition for a position closer to Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>Alaric had a fascination for the golden age of Rome and insisted on his tribesmen calling him Alaricus</span>
				<span class='text'>  Supernatural influences were not lacking to urge him to this great enterprise</span>
				<span class='text'>Some lines of the Roman poet  inform us that he heard a voice proceeding from a  Break off all delays Alaric</span>
				<span class='text'>This very year thou shalt force the Alpine barrier of Italy thou shalt penetrate to the city</span>
				<span class='text'>But the prophecy was not to be fulfilled at this time</span>
				<span class='text'>After spreading desolation through North  and striking terror into the citizens of Rome Alaric was met by  at  today in </span>
				<span class='text'>The battle which followed on April 6 402 coinciding with Easter was a victory for Rome though a costly one</span>
				<span class='text'>But it effectively halted the Goths progress</span>
				<span class='text'>tilichos enemies later reproached him for having gained his victory by taking impious advantage of the great Christian festival</span>
				<span class='text'>Alaric too was outwardly a Christian though an  not  though he continued to practice the Pagan rituals of his ancestors as well as observing Christian ritual practices</span>
				<span class='text'>He had trusted to the sanctity of Easter for immunity from attack</span>
				<span class='text'>larics wife was reportedly taken prisoner after this battle it is not unreasonable to suppose that he and his troops were hampered by the presence of large numbers of women and children which gave his invasion of Italy the character of a </span>
				<span class='text'>fter another defeat before  Alaric left Italy probably in 403</span>
				<span class='text'>He had not penetrated to the city but his invasion of Italy had produced important results</span>
				<span class='text'>It caused the imperial residence to be transferred from  to  and necessitated the withdrawal of  from Britain</span>
				<span class='text'>econd invasion of ItalyAlaric became the friend and ally of his erstwhile opponent </span>
				<span class='text'>By 407 the estrangement between the eastern and western courts had become so bitter that it threatened civil war</span>
				<span class='text'>Stilicho actually proposed using Alarics troops to enforce Honorius claim to the  of Illyricum</span>
				<span class='text'>The death of Arcadius in May 408 caused milder counsel to prevail in the western court but Alaric who had actually entered Epirus demanded in a somewhat threatening manner that if he were thus suddenly requested to desist from war he should be paid handsomely for what modern language would call the expenses of </span>
				<span class='text'>The sum which he named was a large one 4000ampnbsppounds of gold</span>
				<span class='text'>Under strong pressure from Stilicho the Roman Senate consented to promise its payment</span>
				<span class='text'>ut three months later Stilicho and the chief ministers of his party were treacherously slain on Honorius orders</span>
				<span class='text'>In the unrest that followed throughout Italy the wives and children of the foederati were slain</span>
				<span class='text'>name Heather  Consequently these 30000 men flocked to Alarics camp clamouring to be led against their cowardly enemies</span>
				<span class='text'>He accordingly led them across the Julian Alps and in September 408 stood before the walls of  now with no capable general like Stilicho as a defender and began a strict blockade</span>
				<span class='text'>o blood was shed this time Alaric relied on hunger as his most powerful weapon</span>
				<span class='text'>When the ambassadors of the  entreating for peace tried to intimidate him with hints of what the despairing citizens might accomplish he laughed and gave his celebrated answer The thicker the hay the easier mowed After much bargaining the famine stricken citizens agreed to pay a ransom of 5000 pounds of gold 30000 pounds of silver 4000 silken tunics 3000 hides dyed scarlet and 3000 pounds of pepper</span>

				<span class='text'>Thus ended Alarics first siege of Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>hroughout his career Alarics primary goal was not to undermine the Empire but to secure for himself a regular and recognized position within the Empires borders</span>
				<span class='text'>His demands were certainly grand the concession of a block of territory 200ampnbspmiles long by 150 wide between the  and the Gulf of  to be held probably on some terms of nominal dependence on the Empire and the title of commander in chief of the Imperial Army</span>
				<span class='text'>Immense as his terms were the emperor would have been well advised to grant them</span>
				<span class='text'>Honorius however used to see beyond his own safety guaranteed by the dikes and marshes of </span>
				<span class='text'>As all attempts to conduct a satisfactory negotiation with this emperor failed Alaric after instituting a second siege and blockade of  in 409 came to terms with the Senate</span>
				<span class='text'>With their consent he set up a rival emperor the pect of the city a Greek named </span>

				<span class='text'>These negotiations might have succeeded had it not been for the influence of another Goth  an  and theore hereditary enemy of Alaric and his house</span>
				<span class='text'>Alaric again outwitted by an enemys machinations marched southward and in deadly earnest began his third siege of Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>Apparently defence was impossible there are hints not well substantiated of treachery surprise is a more likely explanation</span>
				<span class='text'>However this may be—for our information at this point of the story is meagre—on August 24 410 Alaric and his Visigoths burst in by the  on the northeast of the city</span>

				<span class='text'>But even these exceptional instances show that Rome was not entirely spared the horrors which usually accompany the storming of a besieged city</span>
				<span class='text'>Nonetheless the written sources do not mention damages wrought by fire save the  which were situated close to the gate by which the Goths had made their entrance nor is there any reason to attribute any extensive destruction of the buildings of the city to Alaric and his followers</span>
