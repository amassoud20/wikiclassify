				<span class='text'>In early 1970, Khomeini gave a series of lectures in Najaf on Islamic government, later published as a book titled variously ''Islamic Government'' or ''[[Islamic Government: Governance of the Jurist]]'' (''Hokumat-e Islami : Velayat-e faqih'')</span>
				<span class='text'>his was his most famous and influential work, and laid out his ideas on governance (at that time):* That the laws of society should be made up only of the laws of God (''[[Sharia]]''), which cover &quot;all human affairs&quot; and &quot;provide instruction and establish norms&quot; for every &quot;topic&quot; in &quot;human life</span>

				<span class='text'>' Since Islamic jurists or faqih have studied and are the most knowledgeable in ''Sharia,'' the country's ruler should be a ''[[faqih]]'' who &quot;surpasses all others in knowledge&quot; of Islamic law and justice,&lt;ref&gt;''Islam and Revolution'' (1981), p</span>
