				<span class='text'>tml|accessdate=2014-03-02}}}} (1 January 1484&amp;nbsp;– 11 October 1531) was a leader of the [[Reformation in Switzerland]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Born during a time of emerging [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss]] patriotism and increasing criticism of the [[Swiss mercenaries|Swiss mercenary system]], he attended the [[University of Vienna]] and the [[University of Basel]], a scholarly center of [[Renaissance humanism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He continued his studies while he served as a pastor in [[Glarus]] and later in [[Einsiedeln, Switzerland|Einsiedeln]], where he was influenced by the writings of [[Erasmus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1518, Zwingli became the pastor of the [[Grossmünster]] in [[Zurich]] where he began to preach ideas on reforming the [[Catholic Church]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In his first public controversy in 1522, he attacked the [[Fasting and abstinence in the Roman Catholic Church|custom of fasting]] during [[Lent]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In his publications, he noted corruption in the ecclesiastical hierarchy, promoted clerical marriage, and attacked the use of [[Icon|images]] in places of worship</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1525, Zwingli introduced a new [[Eucharist|communion]] [[liturgy]] to replace the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Zwingli also clashed with the [[Anabaptists]], which resulted in their persecution</span>
				<span class='text'> Historians have debated whether or not he turned Zurich into a [[theocracy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Robert Walton, ''Zwingli's Theocracy'' (Toronto University Press</span>
				<span class='text'>1967)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The Reformation spread to other parts of the Swiss Confederation, but several [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] resisted, preferring to remain [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Zwingli formed an alliance of Reformed cantons which divided the Confederation along religious lines</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1529, a war between the two sides was averted at the last moment</span>
				<span class='text'>Meanwhile, Zwingli's ideas came to the attention of [[Martin Luther]] and other reformers</span>
				<span class='text'>They met at the [[Marburg Colloquy]] and although they agreed on many points of doctrine, they could not reach an accord on the doctrine of the [[Real Presence|Real Presence of Christ]] in the [[Eucharist]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1531 Zwingli's alliance applied an unsuccessful food blockade on the Catholic cantons</span>
				<span class='text'>The cantons responded with an attack at a moment when Zurich was ill prepared</span>
				<span class='text'>Zwingli was killed in battle at the age of 47</span>
				<span class='text'>His legacy lives on in the [[Reformed Christian confessions of faith|confessions]], liturgy, and church orders of the [[Reformed churches]] of today</span>
				<span class='text'>=Historical context==[[File:Historische Karte CH 1515</span>
				<span class='text'>ng|thumb|right|260px|Map of the Swiss Confederation in 1515]]The [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss Confederation]] in Huldrych Zwingli's time consisted of thirteen states ([[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]]) as well as affiliated states and common lordships</span>
				<span class='text'>Unlike the current modern state of [[Switzerland]], which operates under a federal government, the thirteen states were nearly independent, conducting their own domestic and foreign affairs</span>
				<span class='text'>Each state formed its own alliances within and without the Confederation</span>
				<span class='text'>This relative independence served as the basis for conflict during the time of the Reformation when the various states divided between different confessional camps</span>
				<span class='text'>Military ambitions were given an additional impetus with the competition to acquire new territory and resources, as seen for example in the [[Old Zurich War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gäbler|1986|pp=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;The political environment in Europe during the 15th and 16th centuries was also volatile</span>
				<span class='text'>For centuries the foreign policies of the Confederation were determined by its relationship with its powerful neighbour, France</span>
				<span class='text'>Nominally, the Confederation was under the control of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]</span>
				<span class='text'>However, through a succession of wars culminating in the [[Swabian War]], the Confederation had become ''de facto'' independent</span>
				<span class='text'>As the two continental powers and minor states such as the [[Duchy of Milan]], [[Duchy of Savoy]], and the [[Papal States]] competed and fought against each other, there were far-reaching political, economic, and social consequences for the Confederation</span>
				<span class='text'>It was during this time that the [[Swiss mercenaries|mercenary pension system]] became a subject of disagreement</span>
				<span class='text'>The religious factions of Zwingli's time debated vociferously regarding the merits of sending young Swiss men to fight in foreign wars mainly for the enrichment of the cantonal authorities</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gäbler|1986|pp=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;These internal and external factors contributed to the rise of a Confederation national consciousness, in which the term ''fatherland'' (''patria'') began to take on meaning beyond an individual canton</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time, [[Renaissance humanism]], with its universal values and emphasis on scholarship (as exemplified by [[Erasmus]], the &quot;prince of humanism&quot;), had taken root in the country</span>
				<span class='text'>It was within this environment, defined by the confluence of Swiss patriotism and humanism, that Zwingli was born</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gäbler|1986|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;==Life=====Early years (1484–1518)===[[File:Geburtshaus von Huldrych Zwingli</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|260px|House where Zwingli was born in [[Wildhaus]] in what is now the [[Canton of St</span>
				<span class='text'>Gallen]]]]Huldrych Zwingli was born on 1 January 1484 in [[Wildhaus]], in the [[Toggenburg]] valley of [[Switzerland]], to a family of farmers, the third child of nine</span>
				<span class='text'>His father, Ulrich, played a leading role in the administration of the community (''[[Amtmann]]'' or chief local magistrate)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zwingli's primary schooling was provided by his uncle, Bartholomew, a cleric in [[Weesen]], where he probably met [[Katharina von Zimmern]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;katharina&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frauen-und-reformation</span>

				<span class='text'>e|author=|date=|accessdate=2014-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; At ten years old, Zwingli was sent to [[Basel]] to obtain his secondary education where he learned [[Latin language|Latin]] under Magistrate Gregory Bünzli</span>
				<span class='text'>After three years in Basel, he stayed a short time in [[Bern]] with the humanist, Henry Wölfflin</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] in Bern tried to persuade Zwingli to join their order and it is possible that he was received as a novice</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Gäbler24Potter9&gt;{{Harvnb|Gäbler|1986|p=24}}; {{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=9}}</span>
				<span class='text'>Potter mentions this possibility</span>
				<span class='text'>Gäbler states that Zwingli did not refute later claims by opponents that he had been a monk in Bern</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; However, his father and uncle disapproved of such a course and he left Bern without completing his Latin studies</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Gäbler24Potter9&gt;{{Harvnb|Gäbler|1986|p=24}}; {{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He enrolled in the [[University of Vienna]] in the winter semester of 1498 but was expelled, according to the university's records</span>
				<span class='text'>However, it is not certain that Zwingli was indeed expelled, and he re-enrolled in the summer semester of 1500; his activities in 1499 are unknown</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gäbler|1986|p=25}}</span>
				<span class='text'>The word ''exclusus'' (expelled) was added to his matriculation entry</span>
				<span class='text'>Gäbler notes that without a date and reason, it does not conform to what was customary at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Zwingli continued his studies in Vienna until 1502, after which he transferred to the [[University of Basel]] where he received the Master of Arts degree (''Magister'') in 1506</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gäbler|1986|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;Zwingli was ordained in [[Constance]], the seat of the local diocese, and he celebrated his first [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] in his hometown, Wildhaus, on 29 September 1506</span>
				<span class='text'>As a young priest he had studied little theology, but this was not considered unusual at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>His first ecclesiastical post was the pastorate of the town of [[Glarus]], where he stayed for ten years</span>
				<span class='text'>It was in Glarus, whose soldiers were used as mercenaries in Europe, that Zwingli became involved in politics</span>
				<span class='text'>The Swiss Confederation was embroiled in various campaigns with its neighbours: the French, the Habsburgs, and the Papal States</span>
				<span class='text'>Zwingli placed himself solidly on the side of the [[Holy See|Roman See]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In return, [[Pope Julius II]] honoured Zwingli by providing him with an annual pension</span>
				<span class='text'>He took the role of chaplain in several campaigns in Italy, including the [[Battle of Novara (1513)|Battle of Novara]] in 1513</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the decisive defeat of the Swiss in the [[Battle of Marignano]] caused a shift in mood in Glarus in favour of the French rather than the pope</span>
				<span class='text'>Zwingli, the papal partisan, found himself in a difficult position and he decided to retreat to [[Einsiedeln, Switzerland|Einsiedeln]] in the [[canton of Schwyz]]</span>
				<span class='text'>By this time, he had become convinced that mercenary service was immoral and that Swiss unity was indispensable for any future achievements</span>
				<span class='text'>Some of his earliest extant writings, such as ''The Ox'' (1510) and ''The Labyrinth'' (1516), attacked the mercenary system using allegory and satire</span>
				<span class='text'>His countrymen were presented as virtuous people within a French, imperial, and papal triangle</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|p=8}}; {{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=35, 37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zwingli stayed in Einsiedeln for two years during which he withdrew completely from politics in favour of ecclesiastical activities and personal studies</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gäbler|1986|pp=29–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=22–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;Zwingli's time as the pastor of Glarus and Einsiedeln was characterized by inner growth and development</span>
				<span class='text'>He perfected his [[Greek language|Greek]] and he took up the study of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His library contained over three hundred volumes from which he was able to draw upon [[Classics|classical]], [[patristic]], and [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] works</span>
				<span class='text'>He exchanged scholarly letters with a circle of Swiss humanists and began to study the writings of Erasmus</span>
				<span class='text'>Zwingli took the opportunity to meet him while Erasmus was in Basel between August 1514 and May 1516</span>
				<span class='text'>Zwingli's turn to relative [[pacifism]] and his focus on preaching can be traced to the influence of Erasmus</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gäbler|1986|pp=33–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;In late 1518, the post of the ''Leutpriestertum'' (people's priest) of the [[Grossmünster]] at [[Zurich]] became vacant</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Canon (priest)|canons]] of the foundation that administered the Grossmünster recognised Zwingli's reputation as a fine preacher and writer</span>
				<span class='text'>His connection with humanists was a decisive factor as several canons were sympathetic to Erasmian reform</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, his opposition to the French and to mercenary service was welcomed by Zurich politicians</span>
				<span class='text'>On 11 December 1518, the canons elected Zwingli to become the stipendiary priest and on 27 December he moved permanently to Zurich</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gäbler|1986|pp=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;===Zurich ministry begins (1519–1521)===[[File:Prozessionsachse murerplan</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|The Grossmünster in the centre of the medieval town of Zurich ([[Murerplan]], 1576)]]On 1 January 1519, Zwingli gave his first sermon in Zurich</span>
				<span class='text'>Deviating from the prevalent practice of basing a sermon on the Gospel lesson of a particular Sunday, Zwingli, using [[Erasmus]]' New Testament as a guide, began to read through the [[Gospel of Matthew]], giving his interpretation during the sermon, known as the method of ''[[lectio continua]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Old|1998|pp=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to read and interpret the book on subsequent Sundays until he reached the end and then proceeded in the same manner with the [[Acts of the Apostles]], the New Testament [[epistles]], and finally the [[Old Testament]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His motives for doing this are not clear, but in his sermons he used exhortation to achieve moral and ecclesiastical improvement which were goals comparable with Erasmian reform</span>
				<span class='text'>Sometime after 1520, Zwingli's theological model began to evolve into an idiosyncratic form that was neither Erasmian nor [[Lutheran]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Scholars do not agree on the process of how he developed his own unique model</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gäbler|1986|pp=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; One view is that Zwingli was trained as an Erasmian humanist and Luther played a decisive role in changing his theology</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gäbler|1986|p=46}}</span>
				<span class='text'>Proponents of this view are Oskar Farner and Walther Köhler</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Another view is that Zwingli did not pay much attention to Luther's theology and in fact he considered it as part of the humanist reform movement</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gäbler|1986|p=46}}</span>
				<span class='text'>Proponents of this view are Arthur Rich and Cornelius Augustijn</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; A third view is that Zwingli was not a complete follower of Erasmus, but had diverged from him as early as 1516 and that he independently developed his theology</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gäbler|1986|pp=46–47}}</span>
				<span class='text'>A proponent of this view is Gottfried W</span>
				<span class='text'>Locher</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Zwingli's theological stance was gradually revealed through his sermons</span>
				<span class='text'>He attacked moral corruption and in the process he named individuals who were the targets of his denunciations</span>
				<span class='text'>Monks were accused of indolence and high living</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1519, Zwingli specifically rejected the [[veneration]] of saints and called for the need to distinguish between their true and fictional accounts</span>
				<span class='text'>He cast doubts on hellfire, asserted that unbaptised children were not damned, and questioned the power of [[excommunication]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His attack on the claim that [[Tithe|tithing]] was a divine institution, however, had the greatest theological and social impact</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gäbler|1986|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contradicted the immediate economic interests of the foundation</span>
				<span class='text'>One of the elderly canons who had supported Zwingli's election, Konrad Hofmann, complained about his sermons in a letter</span>
				<span class='text'>Some canons supported Hofmann, but the opposition never grew very large</span>
				<span class='text'>Zwingli insisted that he was not an innovator and that the [[Sola scriptura|sole basis of his teachings was Scripture]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gäbler|1986|pp=49–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;Within the [[Bishopric of Constance|diocese of Constance]], Bernhardin Sanson was offering a special [[indulgence]] for contributors to the building of [[St</span>
				<span class='text'>Peter's Basilica|St Peter's]] in Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>When Sanson arrived at the gates of Zurich at the end of January 1519, parishioners prompted Zwingli with questions</span>
				<span class='text'>He responded with displeasure that the people were not being properly informed about the conditions of the indulgence and were being induced to part with their money on false pretences</span>
				<span class='text'>This was over a year after [[Martin Luther]] published his [[Ninety-five theses]] (31 October 1517)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bainton|1995|p=XII}}&lt;/ref&gt; The council of Zurich refused Sanson entry into the city</span>
				<span class='text'>As the authorities in Rome were anxious to contain the fire started by Luther, the Bishop of Constance denied any support of Sanson and he was recalled</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=44, 66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;In August 1519, Zurich was struck by an outbreak of the [[Bubonic plague|plague]] during which at least one in four persons died</span>
				<span class='text'>All of those who could afford it left the city, but Zwingli remained and continued his pastoral duties</span>
				<span class='text'>In September, he caught the disease and nearly died</span>
				<span class='text'>He described his preparation for death in a poem, Zwingli's ''Pestlied'', consisting of three parts: the onset of the illness, the closeness to death, and the joy of recovery</span>
				<span class='text'>The final verses of the first part read:&lt;ref&gt;see e</span>

				<span class='text'>}&lt;/center&gt;In the years following his recovery, Zwingli's opponents remained in the minority</span>
				<span class='text'>When a vacancy occurred among the canons of the Grossmünster, Zwingli was elected to fulfill that vacancy on 29 April 1521</span>
				<span class='text'>In becoming a canon, he became a full citizen of Zurich</span>
				<span class='text'>He also retained his post as the people's priest of the Grossmünster</span>

				<span class='text'>On the first fasting Sunday, 9 March, Zwingli and about a dozen other participants consciously transgressed the fasting rule by cutting and distributing two smoked sausages (the ''Wurstessen'' in [[Christoph Froschauer]]'s workshop)</span>
				<span class='text'>Zwingli defended this act in a sermon which was published on 16 April, under the title ''Von Erkiesen und Freiheit der Speisen'' (Regarding the Choice and Freedom of Foods)</span>
				<span class='text'>He noted that no general valid rule on food can be derived from the Bible and that to transgress such a rule is not a sin</span>
				<span class='text'>The event, which came to be referred to as the [[Affair of the Sausages]], is considered to be the start of the Reformation in Switzerland</span>

				<span class='text'>The city council condemned the fasting violation, but assumed responsibility over ecclesiastical matters and requested the religious authorities clarify the issue</span>
				<span class='text'>The bishop responded on 24 May by admonishing the Grossmünster and city council and repeating the traditional position</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gäbler|1986|pp=52–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;Following this event, Zwingli and other humanist friends petitioned the bishop on 2 July to abolish the requirement of celibacy on the clergy</span>
				<span class='text'>Two weeks later the petition was reprinted for the public in German as ''Eine freundliche Bitte und Ermahnung an die Eidgenossen'' (A Friendly Petition and Admonition to the Confederates)</span>
				<span class='text'>The issue was not just an abstract problem for Zwingli, as he had secretly married a widow, Anna Reinhard, earlier in the year</span>
				<span class='text'>Their cohabitation was well-known and their public wedding took place on 2 April 1524, three months before the birth of their first child</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; They would eventually have four children: Regula, William, Huldrych, and Anna</span>
				<span class='text'>As the petition was addressed to the secular authorities, the bishop responded at the same level by notifying the Zurich government to maintain the ecclesiastical order</span>
				<span class='text'>Other Swiss clergymen joined in Zwingli's cause which encouraged him to make his first major statement of faith, ''Apologeticus Archeteles'' (The First and Last Word)</span>
				<span class='text'>He defended himself against charges of inciting unrest and heresy</span>
				<span class='text'>He denied the ecclesiastical hierarchy any right to judge on matters of church order because of its corrupted state</span>

				<span class='text'>The decision of the council was that Zwingli would be allowed to continue his preaching and that all other preachers should teach only in accordance with Scripture</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gäbler|1986|pp=67–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=100–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;====Second Disputation====In September 1523, [[Leo Jud]], Zwingli's closest friend and colleague and pastor of [[St</span>
				<span class='text'>Peter, Zurich|St</span>
				<span class='text'>Peterskirche]], publicly called for the removal of statues of saints and other icons</span>
				<span class='text'>This led to demonstrations and [[Iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] activities</span>
				<span class='text'>The city council decided to work out the matter of images in a second disputation</span>
				<span class='text'>The essence of the [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] and its sacrificial character was also included as a subject of discussion</span>
				<span class='text'>Supporters of the mass claimed that the eucharist was a true sacrifice, while Zwingli claimed that it was a commemorative meal</span>
				<span class='text'>As in the first disputation, an invitation was sent out to the Zurich clergy and the bishop of Constance</span>
				<span class='text'>This time, however, the lay people of Zurich, the dioceses of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Chur|Chur]] and Basel, the University of Basel, and the twelve members of the Confederation were also invited</span>
				<span class='text'>About nine hundred persons attended this meeting, but neither the bishop nor the Confederation sent representatives</span>
				<span class='text'>The disputation started on 26 October 1523 and lasted two days</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gäbler|1986|pp=72, 76–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;Zwingli again took the lead in the disputation</span>
				<span class='text'>His opponent was the aforementioned canon, Konrad Hofmann, who had initially supported Zwingli's election</span>
				<span class='text'>Also taking part was a group of young men demanding a much faster pace of reformation, who among other things pleaded for replacing [[infant baptism]] with [[Credobaptism|adult baptism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This group was led by [[Conrad Grebel]], one of the initiators of the [[Anabaptist]] movement</span>
				<span class='text'>During the first three days of dispute, although the controversy of images and the mass were discussed, the arguments led to the question of whether the city council or the ecclesiastical government had the authority to decide on these issues</span>
				<span class='text'>At this point, Konrad Schmid, a priest from [[Aargau]] and follower of Zwingli, made a pragmatic suggestion</span>
				<span class='text'>As images were not yet considered to be valueless by everyone, he suggested that pastors preach on this subject under threat of punishment</span>
				<span class='text'>He believed the opinions of the people would gradually change and the voluntary removal of images would follow</span>
				<span class='text'>Hence, Schmid rejected the radicals and their iconoclasm, but supported Zwingli's position</span>
				<span class='text'>In November the council passed ordinances in support of Schmid's motion</span>
				<span class='text'>Zwingli wrote a booklet on the evangelical duties of a minister, ''Kurze, christliche Einleitung'' (Short Christian Introduction), and the council sent it out to the clergy and the members of the Confederation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gäbler|1986|pp=78–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=131–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;===Reformation progresses in Zurich (1524–1525)===[[File:Zue Grossmuenster 06</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;]]In December 1523, the council set a deadline of [[Pentecost]] in 1524 for a solution to the elimination of the mass and images</span>
				<span class='text'>Zwingli gave a formal opinion in ''Vorschlag wegen der Bilder und der Messe'' (Proposal Concerning Images and the Mass)</span>
				<span class='text'>He did not urge an immediate, general abolition</span>
				<span class='text'>The council decided on the orderly removal of images within Zurich, but rural congregations were granted the right to remove them based on majority vote</span>
				<span class='text'>The decision on the mass was postponed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gäbler|1986|pp=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;Evidence of the effect of the Reformation was seen in early 1524</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Candlemas]] was not celebrated, processions of robed clergy ceased, worshippers did not go with palms or relics on [[Palm Sunday]] to the [[Lindenhof]], and [[triptych]]s remained covered and closed after [[Lent]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Potter138&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition to the changes came from Konrad Hofmann and his followers, but the council decided in favour of keeping the government mandates</span>
				<span class='text'>When Hofmann left the city, opposition from pastors hostile to the Reformation broke down</span>
				<span class='text'>The bishop of Constance tried to intervene in defending the mass and the veneration of images</span>
				<span class='text'>Zwingli wrote an official response for the council and the result was the severance of all ties between the city and the diocese</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gäbler|1986|pp=82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;Although the council had hesitated in abolishing the mass, the decrease in the exercise of traditional piety allowed pastors to be unofficially released from the requirement of celebrating mass</span>
				<span class='text'>As individual pastors altered their practices as each saw fit, Zwingli was prompted to address this disorganised situation by designing a communion liturgy in the German language</span>
				<span class='text'>This was published in ''Aktion oder Brauch des Nachtmahls'' (Act or Custom of the Supper)</span>
				<span class='text'>Shortly before [[Easter]], Zwingli and his closest associates requested the council to cancel the mass and to introduce the new public order of worship</span>
				<span class='text'>On [[Maundy Thursday]], 13 April 1525, Zwingli celebrated communion under his new liturgy</span>
				<span class='text'>Wooden cups and plates were used to avoid any outward displays of formality</span>
				<span class='text'>The congregation sat at set tables to emphasise the meal aspect of the sacrament</span>
				<span class='text'>The sermon was the focal point of the service and there was no organ music or singing</span>
				<span class='text'>The importance of the sermon in the worship service was underlined by Zwingli's proposal to limit the celebration of communion to four times a year</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gäbler|1986|pp=105–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;For some time Zwingli had accused [[mendicant]] orders of hypocrisy and demanded their abolition in order to support the truly poor</span>
				<span class='text'>He suggested the monasteries be changed into hospitals and welfare institutions and incorporate their wealth into a welfare fund</span>
				<span class='text'>This was done by reorganising the foundations of the Grossmünster and [[Fraumünster]] and pensioning off remaining nuns and monks</span>
				<span class='text'>The council secularised the church properties and established new welfare programs for the poor</span>
				<span class='text'>Zwingli requested permission to establish a Latin school, the ''Prophezei'' (Prophecy) or [[Carolinum, Zürich|''Carolinum'']], at the Grossmünster</span>
				<span class='text'>The council agreed and it was officially opened on 19 June 1525 with Zwingli and Jud as teachers</span>
				<span class='text'>It served to retrain and re-educate the clergy</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Zurich Bible]] translation, traditionally attributed to Zwingli and printed by [[Christoph Froschauer]], bears the mark of teamwork from the Prophecy school</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;According to {{Harvnb|Gäbler|1986|p=102}}, the first complete Bible was printed in 1531</span>

				<span class='text'>They rejected the role of civil government and demanded the immediate establishment of a congregation of the faithful</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Conrad Grebel]], the leader of the radicals and the emerging Anabaptist movement, spoke disparagingly of Zwingli in private</span>
				<span class='text'>On 15 August 1524 the council insisted on the obligation to baptise all newborn infants</span>
				<span class='text'>Zwingli secretly conferred with Grebel's group and late in 1524, the council called for official discussions</span>
				<span class='text'>When talks were broken off, Zwingli published ''Wer Ursache gebe zu Aufruhr'' (Whoever Causes Unrest) clarifying the opposing points-of-view</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gäbler|1986|pp=125–126}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 January 1525 a public debate was held and the council decided in favour of Zwingli</span>
				<span class='text'>Anyone refusing to have their children baptised was required to leave Zurich</span>
				<span class='text'>The radicals ignored these measures and on 21 January, they met at the house of the mother of another radical leader, [[Felix Manz]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Grebel and a third leader, [[George Blaurock]], performed the first recorded Anabaptist [[Credobaptism|adult baptisms]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=177–182}}&lt;/ref&gt;On February 2, the council repeated the requirement on the baptism of all babies and some who failed to comply were arrested and fined, Manz and Blaurock among them</span>
				<span class='text'>Zwingli and Jud interviewed them and more debates were held before the Zurich council</span>
				<span class='text'>Meanwhile, the new teachings continued to spread to other parts of the Confederation as well as a number of [[Swabia]]n towns</span>
				<span class='text'>On 6–8 November, the last debate on the subject of baptism took place in the Grossmünster</span>
				<span class='text'>Grebel, Manz, and Blaurock defended their cause before Zwingli, Jud, and other reformers</span>
				<span class='text'>There was no serious exchange of views as each side would not move from their positions and the debates degenerated into an uproar, each side shouting abuse at the other</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=183–186}}&lt;/ref&gt;The Zurich council decided that no compromise was possible</span>
				<span class='text'>On 7 March 1526 it released the notorious mandate that no one shall rebaptise another under the penalty of death</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Zwingli, technically, had nothing to do with the mandate, there is no indication that he disapproved</span>
				<span class='text'>Felix Manz, who had sworn to leave Zurich and not to baptise any more, had deliberately returned and continued the practice</span>
				<span class='text'>After he was arrested and tried, he was executed on 5 January 1527 by being drowned in the [[Limmat]] river</span>
				<span class='text'>He was the first Anabaptist martyr; three more were to follow, after which all others either fled or were expelled from Zurich</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|right|thumb|180px|Statue of Zwingli in front of the ''[[Wasserkirche]]'' church in Zurich]]On 8 April 1524, five cantons, [[Canton of Lucerne|Lucerne]], [[Canton of Uri|Uri]], [[Canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]], [[Unterwalden]], and [[Canton of Zug|Zug]], formed an alliance, ''die fünf Orte'' (the Five States) to defend themselves from Zwingli's Reformation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Potter138&quot; /&gt; They contacted the opponents of Martin Luther including [[John Eck]], who had debated Luther in the [[Leipzig Disputation]] of 1519</span>
				<span class='text'>Eck offered to dispute Zwingli and he accepted</span>
				<span class='text'>However, they could not agree on the selection of the judging authority, the location of the debate, and the use of the Swiss Diet as a court</span>
				<span class='text'>Because of the disagreements, Zwingli decided to boycott the disputation</span>
				<span class='text'>On 19 May 1526, all the cantons sent delegates to [[Baden, Switzerland|Baden]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Zurich's representatives were present, they did not participate in the sessions</span>
				<span class='text'>Eck led the Catholic party while the reformers were represented by [[Johannes Oecolampadius]] of Basel, a theologian from [[Württemberg]] who had carried on an extensive and friendly correspondence with Zwingli</span>
				<span class='text'>While the debate proceeded, Zwingli was kept informed of the proceedings and printed pamphlets giving his opinions</span>
				<span class='text'>It was of little use as the Diet decided against Zwingli</span>
				<span class='text'>He was to be banned and his writings were no longer to be distributed</span>
				<span class='text'>Of the thirteen Confederation members, [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]], [[Canton of Solothurn|Solothurn]], [[Canton of Fribourg|Fribourg]], and [[Appenzell]] as well as the Five States voted against Zwingli</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Canton of Bern|Bern]], [[Canton of Basel|Basel]], [[Canton of Schaffhausen|Schaffhausen]], and [[Canton of Zurich|Zurich]] supported him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gäbler|1986|pp=111–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;The Baden disputation exposed a deep rift in the Confederation on matters of religion</span>
				<span class='text'>The Reformation was now emerging in other states</span>
				<span class='text'>The city of [[St Gallen]], an affiliated state to the Confederation, was led by a reformed mayor, [[Joachim Vadian]], and the city abolished the mass in 1527, just two years after Zurich</span>
				<span class='text'>In Basel, although Zwingli had a close relationship with Oecolampadius, the government did not officially sanction any reformatory changes until 1 April 1529 when the mass was prohibited</span>
				<span class='text'>Schaffhausen, which had closely followed Zurich's example, formally adopted the Reformation in September 1529</span>
				<span class='text'>In the case of Bern, [[Berchtold Haller]], the priest at [[Münster of Berne|St Vincent Münster]], and [[Niklaus Manuel]], the poet, painter, and politician, had campaigned for the reformed cause</span>
				<span class='text'>But it was only after another disputation that Bern counted itself as a canton of the Reformation</span>
				<span class='text'>Four hundred and fifty persons participated, including pastors from Bern and other cantons as well as theologians from outside the Confederation such as [[Martin Bucer]] and [[Wolfgang Capito]] from [[Strasbourg]], [[Ambrosius Blarer]] from [[Konstanz|Constance]], and [[Andreas Althamer]] from [[Nuremberg]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Eck and Fabri refused to attend and the Catholic cantons did not send representatives</span>
				<span class='text'>The meeting started on 6 January 1528 and lasted nearly three weeks</span>
				<span class='text'>Zwingli assumed the main burden of defending the Reformation and he preached twice in the Münster</span>
				<span class='text'>On 7 February 1528 the council decreed that the Reformation be established in Bern</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gäbler|1986|pp=113–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;===First Kappel War (1529)==={{Further|First war of Kappel}}Even before the Bern disputation, Zwingli was canvassing for an alliance of reformed cities</span>
				<span class='text'>Once Bern officially accepted the Reformation, a new alliance, ''das Christliche [[Burgrecht]]'' (the Christian Civic Union) was created</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Locher|1981|p=109}}</span>
				<span class='text'>Potter also translates ''Burgrecht'' as &quot;Civic Union&quot;, while {{Harvnb|Gäbler|1986|p=119}} translates it as &quot;Fortress Law&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The first meetings were held in Bern between representatives of Bern, Constance, and Zurich on 5–6 January 1528</span>
				<span class='text'>Other cities, including Basel, [[Biel]], [[Mülhausen]], Schaffhausen, and St Gallen, eventually joined the alliance</span>
				<span class='text'>The Five (Catholic) States felt encircled and isolated, so they searched for outside allies</span>
				<span class='text'>After two months of negotiations, the Five States formed ''die Christliche Vereinigung'' (the Christian Alliance) with [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand of Austria]] on 22 April 1529</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gäbler|1986|pp=119–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=352–355}}&lt;/ref&gt;Soon after the Austrian treaty was signed, a reformed preacher, Jacob Kaiser, was captured in [[Uznach]] and executed in Schwyz</span>
				<span class='text'>This triggered a strong reaction from Zwingli; he drafted ''Ratschlag über den Krieg'' (Advice About the War) for the government</span>
				<span class='text'>He outlined justifications for an attack on the Catholic states and other measures to be taken</span>
				<span class='text'>Before Zurich could implement his plans, a delegation from Bern that included Niklaus Manuel arrived in Zurich</span>
				<span class='text'>The delegation called on Zurich to settle the matter peacefully</span>
				<span class='text'>Manuel added that an attack would expose Bern to further dangers as Catholic [[Valais]] and the Duchy of Savoy bordered its southern flank</span>
				<span class='text'>He then noted, &quot;You cannot really bring faith by means of spears and halberds</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=364}}</span>
				<span class='text'>In [[Early Modern German]], &quot;Warlich man mag mit spiess und halberten den glouben nit ingeben</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Zurich, however, decided that it would act alone, knowing that Bern would be obliged to acquiesce</span>
				<span class='text'>War was declared on 8 June 1529</span>
				<span class='text'>Zurich was able to raise an army of 30,000 men</span>
				<span class='text'>The Five States were abandoned by Austria and could raise only 9,000 men</span>
				<span class='text'>The two forces met near [[Kappel am Albis|Kappel]], but war was averted due to the intervention of Hans Aebli, a relative of Zwingli, who pleaded for an armistice</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gäbler|1986|pp=120–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=362–367}}&lt;/ref&gt;Zwingli was obliged to state the terms of the armistice</span>
				<span class='text'>He demanded the dissolution of the Christian Alliance; unhindered preaching by reformers in the Catholic states; prohibition of the pension system; payment of war reparations; and compensation to the children of Jacob Kaiser</span>
				<span class='text'>Manuel was involved in the negotiations</span>
				<span class='text'>Bern was not prepared to insist on the unhindered preaching or the prohibition of the pension system</span>
				<span class='text'>Zurich and Bern could not agree and the Five (Catholic) States pledged only to dissolve their alliance with Austria</span>
				<span class='text'>This was a bitter disappointment for Zwingli and it marked his decline in political influence</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=367–369}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Land Peace of Kappel, ''der erste [[Landfriede]]'', ended the war on 24 June</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|300px|right|Coloured [[woodcut]] of the Marburg Colloquy, anonymous, 1557]]While Zwingli carried on the political work of the Swiss Reformation, he developed his theological views with his colleagues</span>
				<span class='text'>The famous disagreement between Luther and Zwingli on the interpretation of the [[eucharist]] originated when [[Andreas Karlstadt]], Luther's former colleague from [[Wittenberg]], published three pamphlets on the Lord's Supper in which Karlstadt rejected the idea of a [[real presence]] in the elements</span>
				<span class='text'>These pamphlets, published in Basel in 1524, received the approval of Oecolampadius and Zwingli</span>
				<span class='text'>Luther rejected Karlstadt's arguments and considered Zwingli primarily to be a partisan of Karlstadt</span>
				<span class='text'>Zwingli began to express his thoughts on the eucharist in several publications including ''de Eucharistia'' (On the Eucharist)</span>
				<span class='text'>He attacked the idea of the real presence and argued that the word ''is'' in the [[Words of Institution|words of the institution]]—&quot;This is my body, this is my blood&quot;—means ''signifies''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the words are understood as a metaphor and Zwingli claimed that there was no real presence during the eucharist</span>
				<span class='text'>In effect, the meal was symbolic of the [[Last Supper]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gäbler|1986|pp=131–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;By spring 1527, Luther reacted strongly to Zwingli's views in the treatise ''Dass Diese Worte Christi &quot;Das ist mein Leib etc</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; noch fest stehen wider die Schwarmgeister'' (That These Words of Christ &quot;This is My Body etc</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Still Stand Firm Against the Fanatics)</span>
				<span class='text'>The controversy continued until 1528 when efforts to build bridges between the Lutheran and the Zwinglian views began</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Martin Butzer|Martin Bucer]] tried to mediate while [[Philip of Hesse]], who wanted to form a political coalition of all Protestant forces, invited the two parties to [[Marburg]] to discuss their differences</span>
				<span class='text'>This event became known as the [[Marburg Colloquy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gäbler|1986|pp=135–136}}&lt;/ref&gt;Zwingli accepted Philip's invitation fully believing that he would be able to convince Luther</span>
				<span class='text'>By contrast, Luther did not expect anything to come out of the meeting and had to be urged by Philip to attend</span>
				<span class='text'>Zwingli, accompanied by Oecolampadius, arrived on 28 September 1529 with Luther and [[Philipp Melanchthon]] arriving shortly thereafter</span>
				<span class='text'>Other theologians also participated including Martin Bucer, [[Andreas Osiander]], [[Johannes Brenz]], and [[Justus Jonas]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bainton|1995|p=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debates were held from 1–3 October and the results were published in the fifteen ''Marburg Articles''</span>
				<span class='text'>The participants were able to agree on fourteen of the articles, but the fifteenth article established the differences in their views on the presence of Christ in the eucharist</span>
				<span class='text'>Afterwards, each side was convinced that they were the victors, but in fact the controversy was not resolved and the final result was the formation of two different Protestant confessions</span>

				<span class='text'>He kept up a lively correspondence with Philip</span>
				<span class='text'>Bern refused to participate, but after a long process, Zurich, Basel, and Strasbourg signed a mutual defence treaty with Philip in November 1530</span>

				<span class='text'>Approaches to Venice and Milan also failed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gäbler|1986|pp=141–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;As Zwingli was working on establishing these political alliances, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], the Holy Roman Emperor, invited Protestants to the [[Augsburg Diet]] to present their views so that he could make a verdict on the issue of faith</span>
				<span class='text'>The Lutherans presented the [[Augsburg Confession]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Under the leadership of Martin Bucer, the cities of Strasbourg, Constance, [[Memmingen]], and [[Lindau]] produced the [[Tetrapolitan Confession]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This document attempted to take a middle position between the Lutherans and Zwinglians</span>
				<span class='text'>It was too late for the ''Burgrecht'' cities to produce a confession of their own</span>
				<span class='text'>Zwingli then produced his own private confession, ''Fidei ratio'' (Account of Faith) in which he explained his faith in twelve articles conforming to the articles of the [[Apostles' Creed]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The tone was strongly anti-Catholic as well as anti-Lutheran</span>
				<span class='text'>The Lutherans did not react officially, but criticised it privately</span>
				<span class='text'>Zwingli's and Luther's old opponent, [[John Eck]], counter-attacked with a publication, ''Refutation of the Articles Zwingli Submitted to the Emperor''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gäbler|1986|pp=143–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;When Philip of Hesse formed the [[Schmalkaldic League]] at the end of 1530, the four cities of the Tetrapolitan Confession joined on the basis of a Lutheran interpretation of that confession</span>
				<span class='text'>Given the flexibility of the league's entrance requirements, Zurich, Basel, and Bern also considered joining</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Zwingli could not reconcile the Tetrapolitan Confession with his own beliefs and wrote a harsh refusal to Bucer and Capito</span>
				<span class='text'>This offended Philip to the point where relations with the League were severed</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''Burgrecht'' cities now had no external allies to help deal with internal Confederation religious conflicts</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gäbler|1986|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;The peace treaty of the First Kappel War did not define the right of unhindered preaching in the Catholic states</span>
				<span class='text'>Zwingli interpreted this to mean that preaching should be permitted, but the Five States suppressed any attempts to reform</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''Burgrecht'' cities considered different means of applying pressure to the Five States</span>
				<span class='text'>Basel and Schaffhausen preferred quiet diplomacy while Zurich wanted armed conflict</span>
				<span class='text'>Zwingli and Jud unequivocally advocated an attack on the Five States</span>
				<span class='text'>Bern took a middle position which eventually prevailed</span>
				<span class='text'>In May 1531, Zurich reluctantly agreed to impose a food blockade</span>
				<span class='text'>It failed to have any effect and in October, Bern decided to withdraw the blockade</span>
				<span class='text'>Zurich urged its continuation and the ''Burgrecht'' cities began to quarrel among themselves</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gäbler|1986|pp=148–150}}&lt;/ref&gt;On 9 October 1531, in a surprise move, the Five States declared war on Zurich</span>
				<span class='text'>Zurich's mobilisation was slow due to internal squabbling and on 11 October, 3500 poorly deployed men encountered a Five States force nearly double their size near Kappel on 11 October</span>
				<span class='text'>Many pastors, including Zwingli, were among the soldiers</span>
				<span class='text'>The battle lasted less than one hour and Zwingli was among the 500 casualties in the Zurich army</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gäbler|1986|pp=150–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;Zwingli had considered himself first and foremost a soldier of Christ; second a defender of his country, the Confederation; and third a leader of his city, Zurich, where he had lived for the previous twelve years</span>
				<span class='text'>Ironically, he died at the age of 47, not for Christ nor for the Confederation, but for Zurich</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=414}}&lt;/ref&gt;    Luther wrote, &quot;It is well that Zwingli, [[Andreas Karlstadt|Carlstadt]] and [[Konrad Pellikan|Pellican]] lie dead on the battlefield, for otherwise we could not have kept the [[Philip I of Hesse|Landgrave]], [[Strasbourg]] and others of our neighbors</span>
				<span class='text'> Oh, what a triumph this is, that they have perished</span>
				<span class='text'> How well God knows his business</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;  A false report had added Carlstadt and Pellican to the fatalities</span>
				<span class='text'> Erasmus wrote, &quot;We are freed from great fear by the death of the two preachers, Zwingli and [[Oecolampadius]], whose fate has wrought an incredible change in the mind of many</span>
				<span class='text'> This is the wonderful hand of God on high</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;  Oecolampadius had died on 24 November</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Theology=={{Further|Theology of Huldrych Zwingli}}According to Zwingli, the cornerstone of theology is the Bible</span>
				<span class='text'>Zwingli appealed to scripture constantly in his writings</span>
				<span class='text'>He placed its authority above other sources such as the [[ecumenical councils]] or the [[Church Fathers]], although he did not hesitate to use other sources to support his arguments</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|pp=51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principles that guide Zwingli's interpretations are derived from his rationalist humanist education and his Reformed understanding of the Bible</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; He rejected literalist interpretations of a passage, such as those of the Anabaptists, and used [[synecdoche]] &lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Yoder|first=John Howard|title=Anabaptism and Reformation in Switzerland: An Historical and Theological Analysis of the Dialogues Between Anabaptists and Reformers|publication-place=Kitchener, Ontario|pages=197–202|year=2004|publisher=Pandora Press|isbn=1-894710-44-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and analogies, methods he describes in ''A Friendly Exegesis'' (1527)</span>
				<span class='text'>Two analogies that he used quite effectively were between baptism and [[circumcision]] and between the eucharist and [[Passover]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|pp=64–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also paid attention to the immediate context and attempted to understand the purpose behind it, comparing passages of scripture with each other</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Ulrich Zwingli</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|A rendition of Huldrych Zwingli from the 1906 edition of the ''[[Meyers Konversations-Lexikon]]'']]Zwingli rejected the word ''sacrament'' in the popular usage of his time</span>
				<span class='text'>For ordinary people, the word meant some kind of holy action of which there is inherent power to free the conscience from sin</span>
				<span class='text'>For Zwingli, a sacrament was an initiatory ceremony or a pledge, pointing out that the word was derived from ''sacramentum'' meaning an oath</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|pp=180–185}}&lt;/ref&gt; (However, the word is also translated &quot;mystery</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;) In his early writings on baptism, he noted that baptism was an example of such a pledge</span>
				<span class='text'>He challenged Catholics by accusing them of superstition when they ascribed the water of baptism a certain power to wash away sin</span>
				<span class='text'>Later, in his conflict with the Anabaptists, he defended the practice of infant baptism, noting that there is no law forbidding the practice</span>
				<span class='text'>He argued that baptism was a sign of a covenant with God, thereby replacing circumcision in the Old Testament</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|pp=194–206}}&lt;/ref&gt;Zwingli approached the eucharist in a similar manner to baptism</span>
				<span class='text'>During the first Zurich disputation in 1523, he denied that an actual sacrifice occurred during the mass, arguing that Christ made the sacrifice only once and for all eternity</span>
				<span class='text'>Hence, the eucharist was &quot;a memorial of the sacrifice&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Huldreich Zwinglis Samtliche Werke'', Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>I, 460</span>
				<span class='text'>-10, as quoted in {{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|p=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this argument, he further developed his view, coming to the conclusion of the &quot;signifies&quot; interpretation for the words of the institution</span>
				<span class='text'>He used various passages of scripture to argue against [[transubstantiation]] as well as Luther's views, the key text being John 6:63, &quot;It is the Spirit who gives life, the flesh is of no avail&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Zwingli's approach and interpretation of scripture to understand the meaning of the eucharist was one reason he could not reach a consensus with Luther</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|pp=218–250}}&lt;/ref&gt;The impact of Luther on Zwingli's theological development has long been a source of interest and discussion among Zwinglian scholars</span>
				<span class='text'>Zwingli himself asserted vigorously his independence of Luther</span>
				<span class='text'>The most recent studies have lent credibility to this claim, although some scholars still claim his theology was dependent upon Luther's</span>
				<span class='text'>Zwingli appears to have read Luther's books in search of confirmation from Luther for his own views</span>
				<span class='text'>Zwingli did, however, admire Luther greatly for the stand he took against the pope</span>
				<span class='text'>This, more than Luther's theology, was a key influence on Zwingli's convictions as a reformer</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; What Zwingli considered Luther's courageous stance at the [[Leipzig Disputation]] had a decisive impact on Zwingli during his earliest years as a priest, and during this time Zwingli praised and promoted Luther's writings to support his own similar ideas</span>
				<span class='text'>Like Luther, Zwingli was also a student and admirer of [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; His later writings continued to show characteristic differences from Luther such as the inclusion of non-Christians in heaven as described in ''An Exposition of the Faith''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|pp=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;==Music==Zwingli enjoyed music and could play several instruments, including the violin, harp, flute, dulcimer and hunting horn</span>
				<span class='text'>He would sometimes amuse the children of his congregation on his lute and was so well known for his playing that his enemies mocked him as &quot;the evangelical lute-player and fifer&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;!-- Aber der gute Zwingli pfiff darauf</span>
				<span class='text'>;) --&gt; Three of Zwingli's ''[[Lied]]er'' or hymns have been preserved: the ''Pestlied'' mentioned above, an adaptation of [[Psalms|Psalm]] 65 (c</span>
				<span class='text'>1525), and the ''Kappeler Lied'', which is believed to have been composed during the campaign of the first war of Kappel (1529)</span>

				<span class='text'>126–141&lt;/ref&gt; These songs were not meant to be sung during worship services and are not identified as hymns of the Reformation, though they were published in some 16th-century hymnals</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gäbler|1986|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;Zwingli criticised the practice of priestly chanting and monastic choirs</span>
				<span class='text'>The criticism dates from 1523 when he attacked certain worship practices</span>
				<span class='text'>His arguments are detailed in the Conclusions of 1525, in which, Conclusions 44, 45 and 46 are concerned with musical practices under the rubric of &quot;prayer&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He associated music with images and vestments, all of which he felt diverted people's attention from true spiritual worship</span>
				<span class='text'>It is not known what he thought of the musical practices in early Lutheran churches</span>
				<span class='text'>Zwingli, however, eliminated instrumental music from worship in the church, stating that God had not commanded it in worship</span>

				<span class='text'>439&lt;/ref&gt; Although Zwingli did not express an opinion on congregational singing, he made no effort to encourage it</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gäbler|1986|pp=107–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, scholars have found that Zwingli was supportive of a role for music in the church</span>
				<span class='text'>Gottfried W</span>
				<span class='text'>Locher writes, &quot;The old assertion 'Zwingli was against church singing' holds good no longer&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Zwingli's polemic is concerned exclusively with the medieval Latin choral and priestly chanting and not with the hymns of evangelical congregations or choirs&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Locher goes on to say that &quot;Zwingli freely allowed vernacular psalm or choral singing</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, he even seems to have striven for lively, antiphonal, unison recitative&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Locher then summarizes his comments on Zwingli's view of church music as follows: &quot;The chief thought in his conception of worship was always 'conscious attendance and understanding'—'devotion', yet with the lively participation of all concerned&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Painting of Zwingli by [[Hans Asper]]]]Zwingli was a humanist and a scholar with many devoted friends and disciples</span>
				<span class='text'>He communicated as easily with the ordinary people of his congregation as with rulers such as [[Philip of Hesse]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=417–418}}&lt;/ref&gt; His reputation as a stern, stolid reformer is counterbalanced by the fact that he had an excellent sense of humour and used satiric fables, spoofing, and puns in his writings</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He was more conscious of social obligations than Luther and he genuinely believed that the masses would accept a government guided by God's word</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=418}}&lt;/ref&gt; He tirelessly promoted assistance to the poor, whom he believed should be cared for by a truly Christian community</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wandel|1990|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;In December 1531, the Zurich council selected [[Heinrich Bullinger]] as his successor</span>
				<span class='text'>He immediately removed any doubts about Zwingli's orthodoxy and defended him as a prophet and a martyr</span>
				<span class='text'>During Bullinger's rule, the confessional divisions of the Confederation were stabilised</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gäbler|1986|pp=157–158}}&lt;/ref&gt; He rallied the reformed cities and cantons and helped them to recover from the defeat at Kappel</span>
				<span class='text'>Zwingli had instituted fundamental reforms, while Bullinger consolidated and refined them</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Steinmetz|2001|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;Scholars have found it difficult to assess Zwingli's impact on history, for several reasons</span>
				<span class='text'>There is no consensus on the definition of &quot;Zwinglianism&quot;; by any definition, Zwinglianism evolved under his successor, Heinrich Bullinger; and research into Zwingli's influence on Bullinger and [[John Calvin]] is still rudimentary</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gäbler|1986|pp=155–156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bullinger adopted most of Zwingli's points of doctrine</span>
				<span class='text'>Like Zwingli, he summarised his theology several times, the best-known being the [[Second Helvetic Confession]] of 1566</span>
				<span class='text'>Meanwhile, Calvin had taken over the Reformation in [[Geneva]]</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1549, however, Bullinger and Calvin succeeded in overcoming the differences in doctrine and produced the ''[[Consensus Tigurinus]]'' (Zurich Consensus)</span>
				<span class='text'>They declared that the eucharist was not just symbolic of the meal, but they also rejected the Lutheran position that the body and blood of Christ is in [[Sacramental union|union with the elements]]</span>
				<span class='text'>With this rapprochement, Calvin established his role in the [[Swiss Reformed Church]]es and eventually in the wider world</span>
