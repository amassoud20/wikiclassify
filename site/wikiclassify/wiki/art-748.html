				<span class='text'>arly in his political career, Debs was a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was elected as a Democrat to the [[Indiana General Assembly]] in 1884</span>
				<span class='text'>After working with several smaller unions, including the [[Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen]], Debs was instrumental in the founding of the [[American Railway Union]] (ARU), one of the nation's first [[industrial unions]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After workers at the [[Pullman Palace Car Company]] organized a wildcat strike over pay cuts in the summer of 1894, Debs signed many into the ARU</span>
				<span class='text'>He called a boycott of the ARU against handling trains with Pullman cars, in what became the nationwide [[Pullman Strike]], affecting most lines west of Detroit, and more than 250,000 workers in 27 states</span>
				<span class='text'>To keep the mail running, President [[Grover Cleveland]] used the [[United States Army]] to break the strike</span>
				<span class='text'>As a leader of the ARU, Debs was convicted of federal charges for defying a court injunction against the strike and served six months in prison</span>
				<span class='text'>n jail, Debs read various works of socialist theory and emerged six months later as a committed adherent of the [[Marxism|international socialist]] movement</span>
				<span class='text'>Debs was a founding member of the [[Social Democracy of America]] (1897), the [[Social Democratic Party of America]] (1898), and the [[Socialist Party of America]] (1901)</span>
				<span class='text'>ebs ran as a Socialist candidate for [[President of the United States]] five times, including [[United States presidential election, 1900|1900]] (earning 0</span>
				<span class='text'>3% of the popular vote), [[United States presidential election, 1904|1904]] (2</span>
				<span class='text'>8%), [[United States presidential election, 1908|1908]] (2</span>
				<span class='text'>3%), [[United States presidential election, 1912|1912]] (5</span>
				<span class='text'>9%), and [[United States presidential election, 1920|1920]] (3</span>
				<span class='text'>1%), the last time from a prison cell</span>
				<span class='text'>He was also a candidate for [[United States Congress]] from his native [[Indiana]] in 1916</span>
				<span class='text'>ebs was noted for his oratory, and his speech denouncing American participation in [[World War I]] led to his second arrest in 1918</span>
				<span class='text'>He was convicted under the [[Espionage Act of 1917]] and sentenced to a term of 10 years</span>

				<span class='text'>Debs died in 1926, not long after being admitted to a [[sanatorium]] due to cardiovascular problems that developed during his time in prison</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Although he received some success as a [[Third party (United States)|third-party]] candidate, Debs was largely dismissive of the electoral process; he distrusted the political bargains that [[Victor Berger]] and other &quot;[[Sewer Socialism|Sewer Socialists]]&quot; had made in winning local offices</span>
				<span class='text'>He put much more value on organizing workers into unions, favoring unions that brought together all workers in a given industry over those organized by the craft skills workers practiced</span>
				<span class='text'>== Founding the IWW ===After his work with the [[Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen]] and the [[American Railway Union]], Debs' next major work in organizing a labor union came during the founding of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW)</span>
				<span class='text'>On June 27, 1905, in [[Chicago, Illinois]], Debs and other influential union leaders including [[Big Bill Haywood]], leader of the [[Western Federation of Miners]], and [[Daniel De León]], leader of the [[Socialist Labor Party of America|Socialist Labor Party]], held what Haywood called the &quot;Continental Congress of the working class&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;=== Socialists split with the IWW ===Although the IWW was built on the basis of uniting workers of industry, a rift began between the union and the Socialist Party</span>
				<span class='text'>It started when the electoral wing of the Socialist Party, led by [[Victor L</span>
				<span class='text'>Berger|Victor Berger]] and [[Morris Hillquit]], became irritated with speeches by Haywood</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Peter Carlson, ''Roughneck: The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood</span>

				<span class='text'>Norton, 1983; pg</span>
				<span class='text'>156</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In December 1911, Haywood told a Lower East Side audience at New York's Cooper Union that parliamentary Socialists were &quot;step-at-a-time people whose every step is just a little shorter than the preceding step</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; It was better, Haywood said, to &quot;elect the superintendent of some branch of industry, than to elect some congressman to the United States Congress</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, ''Roughneck,'' pg</span>
				<span class='text'>157</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In response, Hillquit attacked the IWW as &quot;purely anarchistic</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Roughneck159&quot;&gt;Carlson, ''Roughneck,'' pg</span>
				<span class='text'>159</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The Cooper Union speech was the beginning of a split between Bill Haywood and the Socialist Party, leading to the split between the factions of the IWW, one faction loyal to the Socialist Party, and the other to Haywood</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Roughneck159&quot;/&gt; The rift presented a problem for Debs, who was influential in both the IWW and the Socialist Party</span>
				<span class='text'>The final straw between Haywood and the Socialist Party came during the [[Lawrence Textile Strike]] when, disgusted with the decision of the elected officials in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]], to send police who subsequently used their clubs on children, Haywood publicly declared that &quot;I will not vote again&quot; until such a circumstance was rectified</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Carlson, ''Roughneck,'' pg</span>
				<span class='text'>183</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Haywood was purged from the National Executive Committee by passage of an amendment that focused on the [[direct action]] and [[sabotage]] tactics advocated by the IWW</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Carlson, ''Roughneck'', 200&lt;/ref&gt; Debs was probably the only person who could have saved Haywood's seat</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Roughneck199&quot;/&gt;In 1906, when Haywood had been on trial for his life in Idaho, Debs had described him as &quot;the Lincoln of Labor&quot; and called for Haywood to run against [[Theodore Roosevelt]] for President of the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, ''Roughneck,'' pg</span>
				<span class='text'>109</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; but times had changed and Debs, facing a split in the Party, chose to echo Hillquit's words, accusing the IWW of representing anarchy</span>

				<span class='text'>199</span>

				<span class='text'>One year later, four months after Haywood was recalled, the membership dropped to 80,000</span>
				<span class='text'>The reformists in the Socialist Party attributed the decline to the departure of the &quot;Haywood element&quot;, and predicted that the party would recover</span>
				<span class='text'>It did not; in the election of 1912 many of the Socialists who had been elected to public office lost their seats</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Roughneck199&quot;/&gt;=== Leadership style ===Debs was noted by many to be a charismatic speaker who sometimes called on the vocabulary of Christianity and much of the oratorical style of evangelism – even though he was generally disdainful of organized religion</span>
