				<span class='text'>is mother was María del Pilar Bahamonde y Pardo de Andrade (1865 – 28 February 1934) and she was an upper middle-class Roman Catholic</span>
				<span class='text'>His parents married in 1890</span>
				<span class='text'>The young Franco spent much of his childhood with his two brothers, [[Nicolás Franco|Nicolás]] (Ferrol, 1891–1977), later a [[Spanish Navy|naval]] [[officer (armed forces)|officer]] and diplomat who in time was married to María Isabel Pascual del Pobil y Ravello, and [[Ramón Franco|Ramón]], and his two sisters, María del Pilar (Ferrol, 1894 – [[Madrid]], 1989), later wife of Alonso Jaráiz y Jeréz, and María de la Paz (Ferrol, 1899 – Ferrol, 1903)</span>
				<span class='text'>=Military career=====Rif War and advancement through the ranks===Francisco was to follow his father into the Navy, but as a result of the [[Spanish–American War]] the country lost much of its navy as well as most of its colonies</span>
				<span class='text'>Not needing any more officers, the Naval Academy admitted no new entrants from 1906 to 1913</span>
				<span class='text'>To his father's chagrin, Francisco decided to try the [[Spanish Army]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1907, he entered the Infantry Academy in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], graduating in 1910 as a lieutenant</span>
				<span class='text'>Two years later, he obtained a commission to Morocco</span>
				<span class='text'>Spanish efforts to occupy their new African [[protectorate]] provoked the protracted [[Rif War (1909)|Rif War]] (from 1909 to 1927) with native Moroccans</span>
				<span class='text'>Their tactics resulted in heavy losses among Spanish [[officer (armed forces)|military officers]], and also provided an opportunity to earn promotion through merit</span>
				<span class='text'>It was said that officers would receive either ''la caja o la faja'' (a coffin or a general's sash)</span>
				<span class='text'>Franco quickly gained a reputation as a good officer</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1913, Franco transferred into the newly formed [[regulares]]: Moroccan colonial troops with Spanish officers, who acted as [[shock troops]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This transfer into a perilous role may have been decided because Franco failed to win the hand of his first love, [[Sofía Subirán]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1916, aged 23 and already a captain, he was shot by enemy machine gun fire</span>

				<span class='text'>His survival marked him permanently in the eyes of the native troops as a man of ''[[Barakah|baraka]]'' (good luck)</span>
				<span class='text'>He was recommended for Spain's highest honor for gallantry, the coveted ''Cruz Laureada de San Fernando'', but instead received the ''Cross of Maria Cristina, First Class''</span>
				<span class='text'>With that he was promoted to major at the end of February 1917</span>
				<span class='text'>This made him the youngest major in the Spanish army</span>

				<span class='text'>This made him the youngest general in Spain, and perhaps the youngest general of Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1928 Franco was appointed director of the newly created General Military Academy of Zaragoza, a new college for all army [[cadet]]s, replacing the former separate institutions for young men seeking to become officers in infantry, cavalry, artillery, and other branches of the army</span>

				<span class='text'>As a side result of Azaña's military reform, in January 1933, Franco was relegated from the first to the 24th in the list of brigadiers; the same year, on 17 February, he was given the military command of the [[Balearic Islands]]: a post above his rank</span>

				<span class='text'>The government and its supporters, the Popular Front, had launched a campaign against the Opposition whom they accused of plotting against the Republic</span>
				<span class='text'>According to the right-wing opposition, the real enemies of the Republic were not on the Right but on the Left; Spain was in imminent danger of falling under a &quot;Communist dictatorship&quot;, and therefore by fighting the democratically elected Popular Front they, the opposition, were merely doing their duty in defence of law and order and of the freedom and the fundamental rights of the Spanish people</span>

				<span class='text'>Despite the [[Non-Intervention Agreement]] of August 1936, the war was marked by [[Foreign involvement in the Spanish Civil War|foreign intervention]] on behalf of both sides, leading to international repercussions</span>
				<span class='text'>The nationalist side was supported by [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)#Fascism|Fascist Italy]], which sent the ''[[Corpo Truppe Volontarie]]'', and later by [[Nazi Germany]], which assisted with the [[Condor Legion]]</span>
				<span class='text'>They were opposed by the [[Soviet Union]] and communist, socialists and anarchists within Spain</span>
				<span class='text'>The United Kingdom and [[French Third Republic|France]] strictly adhered to the arms embargo,{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} provoking dissensions within the [[Popular Front (France)|French Popular Front]] coalition led by [[Léon Blum]], but the Republican side was nonetheless supported by the Soviet Union and volunteers fighting in the [[International Brigades]] (see for example [[Ken Loach]]'s ''[[Land and Freedom]]'')</span>
				<span class='text'>ecause [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Joseph Stalin]] used the war as a testing ground for modern warfare, some historians, such as [[Ernst Nolte]], have considered the Spanish Civil War, along with World War II, part of a [[European Civil War]] lasting from 1936 to 1945 and characterized mainly as a [[left-wing politics|left]]/[[right-wing politics|right]] ideological conflict</span>
				<span class='text'>This interpretation has not found acceptance among most historians, who consider the Spanish Civil War and Second World War to be two distinct conflicts</span>
				<span class='text'>Among other things, they point to the political heterogeneity on both sides (''See [[Spanish Civil War#Other factions|Spanish Civil War: other factions]]'') and criticize a monolithic interpretation which overlooks the local nuances of [[History of Spain|Spanish history]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==The first months===Following the 18 July 1936 ''[[pronunciamiento]]'', Franco assumed the leadership of the 30,000 soldiers of the [[Spanish Army of Africa]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The first days of the insurgency were marked with a serious need to secure control over the [[Spanish Morocco|Spanish Moroccan Protectorate]]</span>
				<span class='text'>On one side, Franco had to win the support of the natives and their (nominal) authorities, and, on the other, had to ensure his control over the army</span>
				<span class='text'>His method was the summary execution of some 200 senior officers loyal to the Republic (one of them his own cousin)</span>
				<span class='text'>His loyal bodyguard was shot by Manuel Blanco</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>tml | title = La Memoria de los Nuestros | language = Spanish|accessdate =21 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Franco's first problem was how to move his troops to the [[Iberian Peninsula]], since most units of the Navy had remained in control of the Republic and were blocking the [[Strait of Gibraltar]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He requested help from [[Benito Mussolini]], who responded with an unconditional offer of arms and planes; in Germany [[Wilhelm Canaris]], the head of the ''[[Abwehr]]'' military intelligence, persuaded Hitler to support the Nationalists</span>
				<span class='text'>From 20 July onward Franco was able, with a small group of 22 mainly German [[Junkers Ju 52]] aircraft, to initiate an [[Airbridge (logistics)|air bridge]] to [[Seville]], where his troops helped to ensure the rebel control of the city</span>
				<span class='text'>Through representatives, he started to negotiate with the United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy for more military support, and above all for more aircraft</span>
				<span class='text'>Negotiations were successful with the last two on 25 July and aircraft began to arrive in [[Tetouan]] on 2 August</span>
				<span class='text'>On 5 August Franco was able to break the blockade with the newly arrived air support, successfully deploying a ship convoy with some 2,000 soldiers</span>
				<span class='text'>n early August, the situation in western [[Andalusia]] was stable enough to allow him to organize a column (some 15,000 men at its height), under the command of then Lieutenant-Colonel [[Juan Yagüe]], which would march through [[Extremadura]] towards Madrid</span>
				<span class='text'>On 11 August [[Battle of Mérida|Mérida was taken]], and on 15 August [[Battle of Badajoz (1936)|Badajoz]], thus joining both nationalist-controlled areas</span>
				<span class='text'>Additionally, Mussolini ordered a voluntary army, the ''[[Corpo Truppe Volontarie]]'' (CTV) of some 12,000 Italians of fully motorized units to Seville and Hitler added to them a professional squadron from the [[Luftwaffe]] (2JG/88) with about 24 planes</span>
				<span class='text'>All these planes had the Nationalist Spanish insignia painted on them, but were flown by Italian and German nationals</span>
				<span class='text'>The backbone of Franco's aviation in those days were the Italian [[SM</span>
				<span class='text'>9]] and [[SM</span>
				<span class='text'>1]] bombers, the biplane Fiat [[CR</span>
				<span class='text'>2]] fighter and the German [[Junkers Ju 52]] cargo-bomber and the [[Heinkel He 51]] biplane fighter</span>
				<span class='text'>n 21 September, with the head of the column at the town of [[Maqueda]] (some 80&amp;nbsp;km away from Madrid), Franco ordered a detour to free the [[Siege of the Alcázar|besieged garrison at the Alcázar]] of [[Toledo (Spain)|Toledo]], which was achieved on 27 September</span>
				<span class='text'>This controversial decision gave the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] time to strengthen its defences in Madrid and hold the city that year, but the holding of Alcázar was an important morale and propaganda success for the Nationalists</span>
				<span class='text'>==Rise to power===The designated leader of the uprising, General [[José Sanjurjo]], died on 20 July 1936 in a plane crash</span>
				<span class='text'>Therefore, in the nationalist zone, &quot;Political life ceased</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p</span>
				<span class='text'>258&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, only military command mattered; this was divided into regional commands ([[Emilio Mola]] in the North, [[Gonzalo Queipo de Llano]] in [[Seville]] commanding [[Andalusia]], Franco with an independent command and [[Miguel Cabanellas]] in [[Zaragoza]] commanding [[Aragon]])</span>
				<span class='text'>The Spanish Army of Morocco itself was split into two columns, one commanded by General [[Juan Yagüe]] and the other commanded by Colonel [[José Enrique Varela|José Varela]]</span>
				<span class='text'>rom 24 July a coordinating ''[[Military junta|junta]]'' was established, based at [[Burgos]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Nominally led by Cabanellas, as the most senior general,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p</span>
				<span class='text'>282: &quot;to pacify, rather than to dignify, him</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt; it initially included Mola, three other generals, and two colonels; Franco was later added in early August</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p</span>
				<span class='text'>282&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 September it was decided that Franco was to be commander-in-chief (this unified command was opposed only by Cabanellas),&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p</span>
				<span class='text'>421&lt;/ref&gt; and, after some discussion, with no more than a lukewarm agreement from Queipo de Llano and from Mola, also head of government</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[#Thomas|Thomas]], pp</span>
				<span class='text'>423–424&lt;/ref&gt; He was, doubtlessly, helped to this primacy by the fact that, in late July, Hitler had decided that all of Germany's aid to the nationalists would go to Franco</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p</span>
				<span class='text'>356&lt;/ref&gt;Mola had been somewhat discredited as the main planner of the attempted coup that had now degenerated into a civil war, and was strongly identified with the [[Carlism|Carlist]] monarchists and not at all with the [[Falange]], a party with Fascist leanings and connections (&quot;phalanx&quot;, a far-right Spanish political party founded by José Antonio Primo de Rivera), nor did he have good relations with Germany; Queipo de Llano and Cabanellas had both previously rebelled against the dictatorship of [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] and were therefore discredited in some nationalist circles; and Falangist leader [[José Antonio Primo de Rivera]] was in prison in Alicante (he would be executed a few months later) and the desire to keep a place open for him prevented any other Falangist leader from emerging as a possible head of state</span>
				<span class='text'>Franco's previous aloofness from politics meant that he had few active enemies in any of the factions that needed to be placated, and also he had cooperated in recent months with both Germany and Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[#Thomas|Thomas]], pp</span>
				<span class='text'>420–422</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;On 1 October 1936, in [[Burgos]], Franco was publicly proclaimed as ''[[Generalissimo|Generalísimo]]'' of the National army and ''Jefe del Estado'' ([[Head of State]])</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Thomas424&gt;[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p</span>
				<span class='text'>424</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; When Mola was killed in another air accident a year later (which some believe was an assassination) (2 June 1937), no military leader was left from those who organized the conspiracy against the Republic between 1933 and 1935</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[#Thomas|Thomas]], pp</span>
				<span class='text'>689–690</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Military command===Franco personally guided military operations from this time until the end of the war</span>
				<span class='text'>After the [[Siege of Madrid|failed assault on Madrid]] in November 1936, Franco settled on a piecemeal approach to winning the war, rather than bold maneuvering</span>
				<span class='text'>As with his decision to [[Siege of the Alcázar|relieve the garrison]] at Toledo, this approach has been subject of some debate; some of his decisions, such as in June 1938 when he preferred to head for [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencia]] instead of [[Catalonia]], remain particularly controversial from a military viewpoint</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Valencia, Castellon and Alicante saw the last Republican troops defeated by Franco</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough both Germany and Italy provided military support to Franco, the degree of influence of both powers on his direction of the war seems to have been very limited</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, the Italian troops, despite [[Battle of Guadalajara|not being always effective]], were present in most of the large operations in large numbers, while the German aircraft helped the Nationalist air force dominate the skies for most of the war</span>
				<span class='text'>[[António de Oliveira Salazar]]'s [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portugal]] also openly assisted the Nationalists from the start, contributing some 20,000 troops</span>
				<span class='text'>ranco's direction of the German and Italian forces was limited, particularly in the direction of the [[Condor Legion]], but he was by default their supreme commander, and they rarely made decisions on their own</span>
				<span class='text'>For reasons of prestige it was decided to continue assisting Franco until the end of the war, and Italian and German troops paraded on the day of the final victory in Madrid</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Gabriel (1967) ''The Spanish Republic and the civil war 1931–39'',&lt;/ref&gt;===Political command==={{falangism sidebar}}From 1937 to 1948 the Franco regime was doctrinally at least a semi-fascist state, the categorical fascism of the FET (Falange Española Tradicionalista) as state party being mitigated above all by the confessional nature of the regime—creating the strange hybrid known to some as clerical fascism and to Amando de Miguel as &quot;fascismo frailuno&quot; (friar fascism)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[#Payne1987|Payne (1987)]], pp</span>
				<span class='text'>627, 628&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 April 1937 Franco managed to fuse the [[ideologically]] incompatible national-syndicalist [[Falange]] (&quot;phalanx&quot;, a fascist Spanish political party founded by [[José Antonio Primo de Rivera]]) and the [[Carlism|Carlist]] monarchist parties into [[one-party state|one party]] under his rule, dubbed ''[[Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista]]'' (FET y de las JONS), which became the only legal party in 1939</span>
				<span class='text'>Unlike some other fascist movements, the Falangists did develop an official program, the Twenty-Seven Points</span>
				<span class='text'>These exhibited all the main points of fascistic doctrine</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[#Payne1987|Payne (1987)]], p</span>
				<span class='text'>57&lt;/ref&gt; Franco made himself &quot;jefe nacional&quot; of the new FET (Falange Española Tradicionalista), with a secretary, Junta Political and National Council to be named subsequently by himself</span>
				<span class='text'>Five days later (24 April) the raised-arm Fascist salute of the Falange was made the official salute of the Nationalist regime</span>

				<span class='text'>234&lt;/ref&gt; The Falangists' hymn, ''[[Cara al Sol]]'', became the semi-national anthem of Franco's not-yet-established regime</span>
				<span class='text'>his new political formation appeased the pro-Nazi Falangists while tempering them with the anti-German Carlists</span>
				<span class='text'>Franco's brother-in-law [[Ramón Serrano Súñer]], who was his main political advisor, was able to turn the various parties under Franco against each other to absorb a series of political confrontations against Franco himself</span>
				<span class='text'>Franco expelled the original leading members of both the Carlists ([[Manuel Fal Condé]]) and the Falangists ([[Manuel Hedilla]]) to secure his political future</span>
				<span class='text'>Franco also appeased the Carlists by exploiting the Republicans' [[anti-clericalism]] in his propaganda, in particular concerning the &quot;[[Martyrs of the Spanish Civil War|Martyrs of the war]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>While the loyalist forces presented the war as a struggle to defend the Republic against Fascism, Franco depicted himself as the defender of &quot;[[History of Spain|Catholic Spain]]&quot; against &quot;atheist Communism</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;===The end of the Civil War===Before the fall of Catalonia in February 1939, the Prime Minister of Spain [[Juan Negrín]] unsuccessfully proposed, in the meeting of the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] in [[Figueres]], [[capitulation (surrender)|capitulation]] with the sole condition of respecting the lives of the vanquished</span>
				<span class='text'>Negrín was ultimately deposed by Colonel [[Segismundo Casado]], later joined by [[José Miaja]]</span>
				<span class='text'>hereafter only Madrid (see [[History of Madrid]]) and a few other areas remained under control of the government forces</span>
				<span class='text'>On 27 February [[Neville Chamberlain|Chamberlain]] and [[Édouard Daladier|Daladier]]'s governments recognized the Franco regime, before the official end of the war</span>
				<span class='text'>The PCE (the Spanish Communist Party) attempted a mutiny in Madrid with the aim of re-establishing Negrín's leadership, but José Miaja retained control</span>
				<span class='text'>On 28 March 1939, with the help of pro-Franco forces inside the city (the &quot;[[fifth column]]&quot; General Mola had mentioned in propaganda broadcasts in 1936), Madrid fell to the Nationalists</span>
				<span class='text'>The next day, [[Valencia]], which had held out under the guns of the Nationalists for close to two years, also surrendered</span>
				<span class='text'>Victory was proclaimed on 1 April 1939, when the last of the Republican forces surrendered</span>
				<span class='text'>On the same day, Franco placed his sword upon the altar of a church and in a vow, promised that he would never again take up his sword unless Spain itself was threatened with invasion</span>
				<span class='text'>t least 70,000 people were executed during the civil war</span>

				<span class='text'>Despite this, Franco was forced to make some concessions</span>

				<span class='text'>if|thumb|left|1963 [[Spanish peseta]] coin with an image of Franco and lettering reading: ''Francisco Franco, Leader of Spain, by the grace of God'']]The Civil War had ravaged the Spanish economy</span>
				<span class='text'>Infrastructure had been damaged, workers killed, and daily business severely hampered</span>
				<span class='text'>For more than a decade after Franco's victory, the devastated economy recovered very slowly</span>
				<span class='text'>Franco initially pursued a policy of [[autarky]], cutting off almost all international trade</span>
				<span class='text'>The policy had devastating effects, and the economy stagnated</span>
				<span class='text'>Only black marketeers could enjoy an evident affluence</span>
				<span class='text'>n the brink of bankruptcy, a combination of pressure from the [[United States of America|United States]], the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] and, most importantly, the technocrats from [[Opus Dei]], managed to convince the regime to adopt a freer market economy</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of the old guard in charge of the economy were replaced by &quot;technocrata&quot;, despite some initial opposition from Franco</span>
				<span class='text'>From the mid-1950s there was modest acceleration in economic activity after some minor reforms and a relaxation of controls</span>
				<span class='text'>But the growth proved too much for the economy, with shortages and inflation breaking out towards the end of the 1950s</span>
				<span class='text'>hen Franco replaced his ideological ministers with the apolitical technocrats, the regime implemented several development policies that included deep economic reforms</span>
				<span class='text'>After a recession, growth took off from 1959, creating an economic boom that lasted until 1974, and became known as the &quot;[[Spanish Miracle]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>oncurrent with the absence of social reforms, and the economic power shift, a tide of mass emigration commenced to other European countries, and to a lesser extent, to South America</span>
				<span class='text'>Emigration helped the regime in two ways</span>
				<span class='text'>The country got rid of populations it would not have been able to keep in employment, and the emigrants supplied the country with much needed monetary remittances</span>
				<span class='text'>uring the 1960s, the wealthy classes of Francoist Spain experienced further increases in wealth, particularly those who remained politically faithful, while a burgeoning middle class became visible as the &quot;economic miracle&quot; progressed</span>
				<span class='text'>International firms established factories in Spain where salaries were low, company taxes very low, strikes forbidden and workers' health or state protections almost unheard of</span>
				<span class='text'>State-owned firms like the car manufacturer [[SEAT]], truck builder [[Pegaso]] and oil refiner INH, massively expanded production</span>
				<span class='text'>Furthermore, Spain was virtually a new mass market</span>
				<span class='text'>Spain became the second-fastest growing economy in the world between 1959 and 1973, just behind Japan</span>
				<span class='text'>By the time of Franco's death in 1975, Spain still lagged behind most of Western Europe but the gap between its per capita GDP and that of the leading Western European countries had narrowed greatly, and the country had developed a large industrialized economy</span>
				<span class='text'>==Regions==={{unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}Franco was reluctant to enact any form of administrative and legislative decentralisation and kept a fully centralized government with a similar administrative structure to that established by the [[House of Bourbon]] and General [[Miguel Primo de Rivera y Orbaneja]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Such structures were both based on the model of the French centralised State</span>
				<span class='text'>The main drawback of this kind of management is that government attention and initiatives were irregular, and often depended more on the goodwill of regional Government representatives than on regional needs</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, inequalities in schooling, health care or transport facilities among regions were patent: classically affluent regions like Madrid, Catalonia, or the Basque Country fared much better than Extremadura, Galicia or Andalusia</span>
				<span class='text'>Some regions, like Extremadura or La Mancha did not have a university</span>
				<span class='text'>he Basque Country and Catalonia were among the regions that offered the strongest resistance to Franco in the Civil War</span>
				<span class='text'>Franco dissolved the autonomy granted by the [[Second Spanish Republic]] to these two regions and to [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Franco abolished the centuries-old fiscal privileges and autonomy (the ''[[fueros]]'') in two of the three Basque provinces: [[Guipuzcoa]] and [[Biscay]], but kept them for [[Álava]] which had sided with the nationalists in the civil war</span>
				<span class='text'>mong Franco's greatest area of support during the civil war was [[Navarre]], the northern half of which was Basque-speaking</span>
				<span class='text'>Navarre remained a separate region from the Basque Country and Franco also decided to preserve its centuries-old fiscal privileges and autonomy, the so-called [[Fueros of Navarre]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The regional privileges for Álava and Navarre were kept because Álava and Navarre had participated in the initial ''coup d'état'' against the Republican government on 18 July 1936</span>
				<span class='text'>ranco abolished the official statute and recognition of the [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Galician language|Galician]], and [[Catalan language]]s that the [[Second Spanish Republic]] had granted for the first time in the history of Spain</span>
				<span class='text'>He returned to Castilian as the only official language of the State and education</span>
				<span class='text'>The Franco era corresponded with the popularisation of the compulsory national educational system and the development of modern mass media, both controlled by the State and in the Castilian language, and heavily reduced the number of speakers of Basque, Catalan and Galician, as happened during the second half of the 20th century with other European minority languages which were not officially protected, such as [[Scottish Gaelic]] or French [[Breton language|Breton]]</span>
				<span class='text'>By the 1970s the majority of the population in urban areas could not speak the [[minority language]] or, as in some Catalan towns, their social use had been abandoned, leaving them limited to family use</span>
				<span class='text'>Because of the already fragile situation of the Basque language before the Civil War, it became the most endangered language in Spain</span>
				<span class='text'>By the 1970s Basque lacked a sufficient number of new speakers to assure its future, and moved closer to extinction</span>
				<span class='text'>It is now recognised that the Basque language would have disappeared in a few more decades if the same linguistic policies had been preserved</span>
				<span class='text'>This was the main reason that drove the Francoist provincial government of [[Álava]] to create a network of Basque medium schools ([[Ikastola]]) in 1973 which were State-financed</span>
				<span class='text'>=Franco and the United States==At the end of World War II, Spain's fascist dealings made it an international pariah and kept the country out of the United Nations, the Marshall Plan and NATO; in the 1950s, however, Spain's strategic location and hostility towards the Soviet Union led the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>to reconsider its position towards Spain and entered into a trade and military alliance as part of its policy of containment</span>
				<span class='text'>his historic alliance began with the signing of the [[Pact of Madrid]] in 1953, which guaranteed American support for Franco's regime</span>
