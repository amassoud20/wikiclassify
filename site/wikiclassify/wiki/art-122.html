				<span class='text'>His ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', originally called ''{{lang|it|Comedìa}}'' (modern Italian: ''Commedia'') and later christened ''{{lang|it|Divina}}'' by [[Boccaccio]], is widely considered the greatest literary work composed in the [[Italian language]] and a masterpiece of [[world literature]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bloom|first=Harold|authorlink=Harold Bloom|title=The Western Canon|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;In the late Middle Ages, the overwhelming majority of poetry was written in Latin, and therefore accessible only to affluent and educated audiences</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''[[De vulgari eloquentia]]'' (''On Eloquence in the Vernacular''), however, Dante defended use of the [[vernacular]] in literature</span>
				<span class='text'>He himself would even write in the [[Tuscan dialect]] for works such as ''[[La Vita Nuova|The New Life]]'' (1295) and the aforementioned ''Divine Comedy''; this choice, although highly unorthodox, set a hugely important precedent that later Italian writers such as [[Petrarch]] and [[Boccaccio]] would follow</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, Dante played an instrumental role in establishing the national language of Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>Dante's significance also extends past his home country; his depictions of [[Hell]], [[Purgatory]], and [[Heaven]] have provided inspiration for a large body of [[Western art]], and are cited as an influence on the works of [[John Milton]], [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], [[William Shakespeare]], and [[Lord Alfred Tennyson]], among many others</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, the first use of the interlocking three-line rhyme scheme, or the ''[[terza rima]]'', is attributed to him</span>
				<span class='text'>ante has been called &quot;the Father of the Italian language&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>=Life==Dante was born in [[Florence]], [[Italy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The exact date of his birth is unknown, although it is generally believed to be around 1265</span>
				<span class='text'>This can be deduced from autobiographic allusions in the ''[[Divine Comedy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>' Its first section, the ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]],'' begins, ''&quot;Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita&quot;'' (&quot;Midway upon the journey of our life&quot;), implying that Dante was around 35 years old, since the average lifespan according to the Bible (Psalm 89:10&lt;!-- do not change to Ps</span>
				<span class='text'>90; in the Vulgate, as specified, the chapter is 89 --&gt;, Vulgate) is 70 years; and since his imaginary travel to the nether world took place in 1300, he was most probably born around 1265</span>
				<span class='text'>Some verses of the ''Paradiso'' section of the ''Divine Comedy'' also provide a possible clue that he was born under the sign of [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]]: &quot;As I revolved with the eternal twins, I saw revealed, from hills to river outlets, the threshing-floor that makes us so ferocious&quot; (XXII&amp;nbsp;151–154)</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1265, the sun was in Gemini between approximately May&amp;nbsp;11 and June&amp;nbsp;11</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;His birth date is listed as &quot;probably in the end of May&quot; by Robert Hollander in &quot;Dante&quot; in ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]],'' volume&amp;nbsp;4</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Boccaccio, the poet himself said he was born in May</span>
				<span class='text'>See &quot;Alighieri, Dante&quot; in the ''Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani</span>
				<span class='text'>'&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Dante alighieri, Palazzo dei Giudici</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of Dante, from a fresco in the Palazzo dei Giudici, Florence]]Dante claimed that his family descended from the ancient Romans (''Inferno'', XV, 76), but the earliest relative he could mention by name was [[Cacciaguida]] degli Elisei (''Paradiso'', XV, 135), born no earlier than about 1100</span>
				<span class='text'>Dante's father, Alaghiero&lt;ref name=Trecc/&gt; or [[Alighiero di Bellincione]], was a White [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph]] who suffered no reprisals after the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Ghibellines]] won the [[Battle of Montaperti]] in the middle of the 13th&amp;nbsp;century</span>
				<span class='text'>This suggests that Alighiero or his family may have enjoyed some protective prestige and status, although some suggest that the politically inactive Alighiero was of such low standing that he was not considered worth exiling</span>

				<span class='text'>The poet's mother was Bella, likely a member of the Abati family</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Trecc/&gt; She died when Dante was not yet ten years old, and Alighiero soon married again, to Lapa di Chiarissimo Cialuffi</span>
				<span class='text'>It is uncertain whether he really married her, since widowers were socially limited in such matters, but this woman definitely bore him two children, Dante's half-brother Francesco and half-sister Tana (Gaetana)</span>
				<span class='text'>When Dante was 12, he was promised in marriage to Gemma di Manetto Donati, daughter of Manetto Donati, member of the powerful Donati family</span>

				<span class='text'>But by this time Dante had fallen in love with another, [[Beatrice Portinari]] (known also as Bice), whom he first met when he was only nine</span>
				<span class='text'>Years after his marriage to Gemma he claims to have met Beatrice again; he wrote several sonnets to Beatrice but never mentioned Gemma in any of his poems</span>

				<span class='text'>To take any part in public life, one had to enroll in one of the city's many commercial or artisan guilds, so Dante entered the Physicians' and Apothecaries' Guild</span>
				<span class='text'>In the following years, his name is occasionally recorded as speaking or voting in the various councils of the republic</span>
				<span class='text'>A substantial portion of minutes from such meetings in the years 1298–1300 was lost during [[World War II]], however, so the true extent of Dante's participation in the city's councils is uncertain</span>

				<span class='text'>Although several others subsequently claimed to be his offspring, it is likely that only [[Jacopo Alighieri|Jacopo]], Pietro, Giovanni and Antonia were his actual children</span>
				<span class='text'>Antonia later became a nun, taking the name Sister Beatrice</span>
				<span class='text'>==Education and poetry==={{Refimprove section|date=December 2015}}Not much is known about Dante's education; he presumably studied at home or in a chapter school attached to a church or monastery in Florence</span>
				<span class='text'>It is known that he studied [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] poetry and that he admired the compositions of the Bolognese poet [[Guido Guinizelli]]—whom in ''Purgatorio'' XXVI he characterized as his &quot;father&quot;—at a time when the [[Sicilian school]] (''Scuola poetica Siciliana''), a cultural group from [[Sicily]], was becoming known in Tuscany</span>
				<span class='text'>His interests brought him to discover the [[Occitan|Provençal]] poetry of the [[troubadours]], such as [[Arnaut Daniel]], and the Latin writers of [[classical antiquity]], including [[Cicero]], [[Ovid]] and especially [[Virgil]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Dante Alighieri01</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|left|thumb|upright|Statue of Dante at the [[Uffizi]], Florence]]Dante said he first met [[Beatrice Portinari]], daughter of [[Folco Portinari]], at age nine, and claimed to have fallen in love with her &quot;[[Love at first sight|at first sight]]&quot;, apparently without even talking with her</span>
				<span class='text'>He saw her frequently after age 18, often exchanging greetings in the street, but never knew her well</span>
				<span class='text'>In effect, he set an example of so-called [[courtly love]], a phenomenon developed in French and Provençal poetry of prior centuries</span>
				<span class='text'>Dante's experience of such love was typical, but his expression of it was unique</span>
				<span class='text'>It was in the name of this love that Dante left his imprint on the ''[[dolce stil novo]]'' (''sweet new style,'' a term which Dante himself coined), and he would join other contemporary poets and writers in exploring never-before-emphasized aspects of love (''Amore'')</span>
				<span class='text'>Love for Beatrice (as [[Petrarch]] would show for Laura somewhat differently) would be his reason for poetry and for living, together with political passions</span>
				<span class='text'>In many of his poems, she is depicted as semi-divine, watching over him constantly and providing spiritual instruction, sometimes harshly</span>
				<span class='text'>When Beatrice died in 1290, Dante sought refuge in Latin literature</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''[[Convivio]]'' chronicles his having read [[Boethius]]'s ''[[The Consolation of Philosophy|De consolatione philosophiae]]'' and Cicero's ''[[Laelius de Amicitia|De Amicitia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>' He then dedicated himself to philosophical studies at religious schools like the Dominican one in [[Santa Maria Novella]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He took part in the disputes that the two principal [[mendicant order|mendicant]] orders ([[Franciscan]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]) publicly or indirectly held in Florence, the former explaining the doctrines of the mystics and of St</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Bonaventure]], the latter expounding on the theories of St</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Thomas Aquinas]]</span>
				<span class='text'>t 18, Dante met [[Guido Cavalcanti]], [[Lapo Gianni]], [[Cino da Pistoia]] and soon after [[Brunetto Latini]]; together they became the leaders of the ''dolce stil novo</span>
				<span class='text'>' Brunetto later received special mention in the ''Divine Comedy'' (''Inferno'', XV, 28) for what he had taught Dante: ''Nor speaking less on that account I go With Ser Brunetto, and I ask who are his most known and most eminent companions</span>
				<span class='text'>' Some fifty poetical commentaries by Dante are known (the so-called ''[[The Rime|Rime]],'' rhymes), others being included in the later ''Vita Nuova'' and ''Convivio</span>
				<span class='text'>' Other studies are reported, or deduced from ''Vita Nuova'' or the ''Comedy,'' regarding painting and music</span>

				<span class='text'>To further his political career, he became a pharmacist</span>
				<span class='text'>He did not intend to practice as one, but a law issued in 1295 required nobles aspiring to public office to be enrolled in one of the Corporazioni delle Arti e dei Mestieri, so Dante obtained admission to the Apothecaries' Guild</span>
				<span class='text'>This profession was not inappropriate, since at that time books were sold from apothecaries' shops</span>
				<span class='text'>As a politician he accomplished little, but held various offices over some years in a city rife with political unrest</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Dante Luca</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb||Dante Alighieri, detail from [[Luca Signorelli]]'s fresco, [[Chapel of San Brizio]], [[Orvieto Cathedral]]]]After defeating the Ghibellines, the Guelphs divided into two factions: the White Guelphs (''Guelfi Bianchi'')—Dante's party, led by Vieri dei Cerchi—and the Black Guelphs (''Guelfi Neri''), led by [[Corso Donati]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the split was along family lines at first, ideological differences arose based on opposing views of the papal role in Florentine affairs, with the Blacks supporting the Pope and the Whites wanting more freedom from Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>The Whites took power first and expelled the Blacks</span>
				<span class='text'>In response, [[Pope Boniface VIII]] planned a military occupation of Florence</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1301, [[Charles of Valois]], brother of King [[Philip IV of France]], was expected to visit Florence because the Pope had appointed him peacemaker for [[Tuscany]]</span>
				<span class='text'>But the city's government had treated the Pope's ambassadors badly a few weeks before, seeking independence from papal influence</span>
				<span class='text'>It was believed that Charles had received other unofficial instructions, so the council sent a delegation to Rome to ascertain the Pope's intentions</span>
				<span class='text'>Dante was one of the delegates</span>
				<span class='text'>==Exile and death===Pope Boniface quickly dismissed the other delegates and asked Dante alone to remain in Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time (November 1, 1301), Charles of Valois entered Florence with the Black Guelphs, who in the next six days destroyed much of the city and killed many of their enemies</span>
				<span class='text'>A new Black Guelph government was installed, and [[Cante de' Gabrielli]] da [[Gubbio]] was appointed ''[[podestà]]'' of the city</span>
				<span class='text'>In March 1302, Dante, a White Guelph by affiliation, along with the [[Gherardini family]], was condemned to exile for two years and ordered to pay a large fine</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[Dino Compagni]], ''Cronica delle cose occorrenti ne' tempi suoi''&lt;/ref&gt; Dante was accused of corruption and financial wrongdoing by the Black Guelphs for the time that Dante was serving as city prior (Florence's highest position) for two months in 1300</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Harrison, p</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Dante did not pay the fine, in part because he believed he was not guilty and in part because all his assets in Florence had been seized by the Black Guelphs</span>
				<span class='text'>He was condemned to perpetual exile; if he returned to Florence without paying the fine, he could have been burned at the stake</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|left|thumb|A recreated [[death mask]] of Dante Alighieri in [[Palazzo Vecchio]], Florence]]He took part in several attempts by the White Guelphs to regain power, but these failed due to treachery</span>
				<span class='text'>Dante, bitter at the treatment he received from his enemies, also grew disgusted with the infighting and ineffectiveness of his erstwhile allies and vowed to become a party of one</span>
				<span class='text'>He went to [[Verona, Italy|Verona]] as a guest of [[Bartolomeo I della Scala]], then moved to [[Sarzana]] in [[Liguria]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Later he is supposed to have lived in [[Lucca]] with a woman called Gentucca, who made his stay comfortable (and was later gratefully mentioned in ''Purgatorio,'' XXIV, 37)</span>
				<span class='text'>Some speculative sources claim he visited Paris between 1308 and 1310, and other sources even less trustworthy took him to [[Oxford]]: these claims, first occurring in [[Boccaccio]]'s book on Dante several decades after his death, seem inspired by readers who were impressed with the poet's wide learning and erudition</span>
				<span class='text'>Evidently, Dante's command of philosophy and his literary interests deepened in exile and when he was no longer busy with the day-to-day business of Florentine domestic politics, and this is evidenced in his prose writings in this period, but there is no real evidence that he ever left Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>Dante's ''Immensa Dei dilectione testante'' to Henry VII of Luxembourg confirms his residence &quot;beneath the springs of Arno, near Tuscany&quot; in March 1311</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1310, Holy Roman Emperor [[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VII]] of [[Luxembourg]] marched into Italy at the head of 5,000 troops</span>
				<span class='text'>Dante saw in him a new [[Charlemagne]] who would restore the office of the Holy Roman Emperor to its former glory and also retake Florence from the Black Guelphs</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote to Henry and several Italian princes, demanding that they destroy the Black Guelphs</span>
				<span class='text'>Mixing religion and private concerns in his writings, he invoked the worst anger of God against his city and suggested several particular targets that were also his personal enemies</span>
				<span class='text'>It was during this time that he wrote ''[[De Monarchia]]'', proposing a [[universal monarchy]] under Henry VII</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Dante Alighieri Statue SantaCroce</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Statue of Dante in the Piazza di Santa Croce in Florence, [[Enrico Pazzi]], 1865]]At some point during his exile, he conceived of the ''Comedy,'' but the date is uncertain</span>
				<span class='text'>The work is much more assured and on a larger scale than anything he had produced in Florence; it is likely he would have undertaken such a work only after he realized his political ambitions, which had been central to him up to his banishment, had been halted for some time, possibly forever</span>
				<span class='text'>It is also noticeable that Beatrice has returned to his imagination with renewed force and with a wider meaning than in the ''Vita Nuova''; in ''Convivio'' (written c</span>
				<span class='text'>304–07) he had declared that the memory of this youthful romance belonged to the past</span>
				<span class='text'>n early outside indication that the poem was under way is a notice by Francesco da Barberino, tucked into his ''Documenti d'Amore'' (''Lessons of Love''), written probably in 1314 or early 1315</span>
				<span class='text'>Speaking of Virgil, Francesco notes in appreciative words that Dante followed the Roman classic in a poem called &quot;Comedy&quot; and that the setting of this poem (or part of it) was the underworld; i</span>

				<span class='text'>''Paradiso'' seems to have been published posthumously</span>
				<span class='text'>n Florence, Baldo d'Aguglione pardoned most of the White Guelphs in exile and allowed them to return</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Dante had gone too far in his violent letters to ''Arrigo'' (Henry VII) and his sentence was not revoked</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1312 Henry assaulted Florence and defeated the Black Guelphs, but there is no evidence that Dante was involved</span>
				<span class='text'>Some say he refused to participate in the assault on his city by a foreigner; others suggest that he had become unpopular with the White Guelphs, too, and that any trace of his passage had carefully been removed</span>
				<span class='text'>Henry VII died (from a fever) in 1313, and with him any hope for Dante to see Florence again</span>
				<span class='text'>He returned to Verona, where [[Cangrande I della Scala]] allowed him to live in certain security and, presumably, in a fair degree of prosperity</span>
				<span class='text'>Cangrande was admitted to Dante's Paradise (''Paradiso'', XVII, 76)</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1315, Florence was forced by [[Uguccione della Faggiuola]] (the military officer controlling the town) to grant an amnesty to those in exile, including Dante</span>
				<span class='text'>But for this, Florence required public penance in addition to a heavy fine</span>
				<span class='text'>Dante refused, preferring to remain in exile</span>
				<span class='text'>When Uguccione defeated Florence, Dante's death sentence was commuted to house arrest on condition that he go to Florence to swear he would never enter the town again</span>

				<span class='text'>While the vision of Hell, the ''Inferno,'' is vivid for most modern readers, the theological niceties presented in the other books require a certain amount of patience and knowledge to appreciate</span>
				<span class='text'>''Purgatorio'' is arguably the most lyrical of the three, referencing more contemporary poets and artists than ''Inferno''; ''Paradiso'' is the most heavily theological, and the one in which, many scholars have argued, the ''Divine Comedy'''s most beautiful and mystic passages appear (e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> when Dante looks into the face of God: &quot;all'alta fantasia qui mancò possa&quot;—&quot;at this high moment, ability failed my capacity to describe,&quot; ''Paradiso,'' XXXIII, 142)</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:DanteDetail</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|Dante, poised between the mountain of purgatory and the city of Florence, displays the [[incipit]] ''Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita'' in a detail of Domenico di Michelino's painting, Florence, 1465</span>
				<span class='text'>]With its seriousness of purpose, its literary stature and the range—both stylistic and thematic—of its content, the ''Comedy'' soon became a cornerstone in the evolution of Italian as an established literary language</span>
				<span class='text'>Dante was more aware than most early Italian writers of the variety of Italian dialects and of the need to create a literature and a unified literary language beyond the limits of Latin writing at the time; in that sense, he is a forerunner of the Renaissance, with its effort to create vernacular literature in competition with earlier classical writers</span>
				<span class='text'>Dante's in-depth knowledge (within the limits of his time) of Roman antiquity, and his evident admiration for some aspects of pagan Rome, also point forward to the 15th century</span>
				<span class='text'>Ironically, while he was widely honored in the centuries after his death, the ''Comedy'' slipped out of fashion among men of letters: too medieval, too rough and tragic, and not stylistically refined in the respects that the high and late Renaissance came to demand of literature</span>
				<span class='text'>e wrote the ''Comedy'' in a language he called &quot;Italian&quot;, in some sense an amalgamated literary language mostly based on the regional dialect of Tuscany, but with some elements of Latin and other regional dialects</span>
				<span class='text'>He deliberately aimed to reach a readership throughout Italy including laymen, clergymen and other poets</span>
				<span class='text'>By creating a poem of epic structure and philosophic purpose, he established that the [[Italian language]] was suitable for the highest sort of expression</span>
				<span class='text'>In French, Italian is sometimes nicknamed ''la langue de Dante</span>
				<span class='text'>' Publishing in the vernacular language marked Dante as one of the first (among others such as [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] and [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]) to break free from standards of publishing in only Latin (the language of [[liturgy]], history and scholarship in general, but often also of lyric poetry)</span>
				<span class='text'>This break set a precedent and allowed more literature to be published for a wider audience, setting the stage for greater levels of literacy in the future</span>
				<span class='text'>However, unlike [[Boccaccio]], [[John Milton|Milton]] or [[Ariosto]], Dante did not really become an author read all over Europe until the Romantic era</span>
				<span class='text'>To the Romantics, Dante, like [[Homer]] and [[Shakespeare]], was a prime example of the &quot;original genius&quot; who sets his own rules, creates persons of overpowering stature and depth, and goes far beyond any imitation of the patterns of earlier masters; and who, in turn, cannot truly be imitated</span>
				<span class='text'>Throughout the 19th century, Dante's reputation grew and solidified; and by 1865, the 600th anniversary of his birth, he had become established as one of the greatest literary icons of the Western world</span>

				<span class='text'>This oldest picture of Dante was painted just prior to his exile and has since been heavily restored</span>
				<span class='text'>]New readers often wonder how such a serious work may be called a &quot;[[comedy]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Comedy#Etymology|In the classical sense]] the word ''comedy'' refers to works which reflect belief in an ordered universe, in which events tend toward not only a happy or amusing ending but one influenced by a Providential will that orders all things to an ultimate good</span>
				<span class='text'>By this meaning of the word, as Dante himself wrote in a letter to [[Cangrande I della Scala]], the progression of the pilgrimage from Hell to Paradise is the paradigmatic expression of comedy, since the work begins with the pilgrim's moral confusion and ends with the vision of God</span>
