				<span class='text'>[[Electrotype]], obverse]]'''Girolamo Savonarola''' ({{IPA-it|savonaˈrɔːla|lang}}; 21 September 1452 – 23 May 1498) was an Italian [[Dominican Order|Dominican friar]] and preacher active in [[Renaissance]] [[Florence]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was known for his prophecies of civic glory, the destruction of secular art and culture, and his calls for Christian renewal</span>
				<span class='text'>He denounced clerical corruption, despotic rule and the exploitation of the poor</span>
				<span class='text'>He prophesied the coming of a biblical flood and a new [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]] from the north who would reform the Church</span>
				<span class='text'>In September 1494, when [[Charles VIII of France]] invaded Italy, and threatened Florence, such prophesies seemed on the verge of fulfillment</span>
				<span class='text'>While Savonarola intervened with the French king, the Florentines expelled the ruling [[House of Medici|Medici]] and, at the friar's urging, established a &quot;popular&quot; republic</span>
				<span class='text'>Declaring that Florence would be the [[New Jerusalem]], the world center of [[Christianity]] and  &quot;richer, more powerful, more glorious than ever&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Text in Weinstein, ''Savonarola The Rise and Fall of a Renaissance Prophet'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>122&lt;/ref&gt; he instituted an extreme puritanical campaign, enlisting the active help of Florentine youth</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1495 when Florence refused to join [[Pope Alexander VI]]’s [[Holy League (1495)|Holy League]] against the French, the Vatican summoned Savonarola to Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>He disobeyed and further defied the pope by preaching under a ban, highlighting his campaign for reform with processions, [[Bonfire of the Vanities|bonfires of the vanities]], and pious theatricals</span>
				<span class='text'>In retaliation, the Pope excommunicated him in May 1497, and threatened to place Florence under an interdict</span>
				<span class='text'>A [[Trial by ordeal|trial by fire]] proposed by a rival Florentine preacher in April 1498 to test Savonarola's divine mandate turned into a fiasco, and popular opinion turned against him</span>
				<span class='text'>Savonarola and two of his supporting friars were imprisoned</span>
				<span class='text'>Under torture, Savonarola confessed that he had invented his visions and prophecies</span>
				<span class='text'>On May 23, 1498, Church and civil authorities condemned, hanged, and burned the three friars in the main square of Florence</span>
				<span class='text'>avonarola's devotees, the Piagnoni, kept his cause of republican freedom and religious reform alive well into the following century, although the Medici—restored to power in 1512 with the help of the papacy—eventually broke the movement</span>

				<span class='text'>pg||thumb|Fantasy portrait of Girolamo Savonarola by [[Moretto da Brescia]], c</span>
				<span class='text'>1524</span>
				<span class='text'>]Savonarola was born on September 21, 1452, in [[Ferrara]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His grandfather, Michele Savonarola, was a noted physician and [[polymath]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Savonarola's mother Elena claimed a lineage from the Bonacossi family of Mantua</span>
				<span class='text'>She and her husband Niccolo had seven children, of whom Girolamo was third</span>
				<span class='text'>His grandfather was a very successful physician who oversaw his education</span>
				<span class='text'>His family had amassed in his grandfather's footsteps</span>
				<span class='text'>At some point, however, he abandoned his career intentions</span>
				<span class='text'>n his early poems, he expresses his preoccupation with the state of the Church and of the world</span>
				<span class='text'>He began to write poetry of an apocalyptic bent, notably &quot;On the Ruin of the World&quot; (1472) and &quot;On the Ruin of the Church&quot; (1475), in which he singled out the papal court at Rome for special obloquy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;&quot;English translations in Savonarola ''A Guide to Righteous Living and Other Works'' ed</span>
				<span class='text'>Konrad Eisenbichler (Toronto, Centre for Reformation and Renaissance Studies, 2003) 61–68&lt;/ref&gt; About the same time, he seems to have been thinking about a life in religion</span>
				<span class='text'>As he later told his biographer, a sermon he heard by a preacher in Faenza persuaded him to abandon the world</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gianfrancesco Pico della Mirandola, ''Vita Hieronymi Savonarolae'' ed</span>
				<span class='text'>Elisabetta Schisto (Florence, 1999) 114</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Most of his biographers reject or ignore the account of his younger brother and follower, Maurelio (later fra Mauro), that in his youth Girolamo had been spurned by a neighbor, Laudomia Strozzi, to whom he proposed marriage</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Reported by fra Benedetto Luschino in his ''Vulnera Diligentis'' ed</span>
				<span class='text'>Stefano Dall' Aglio (Florence, 2002) pp</span>
				<span class='text'>22–3, 301</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; True or not, in a letter he wrote to his father when he left home to join the [[Dominican Order]] he hints at being troubled by desires of the flesh</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;&quot;Like you, I am made of flesh and my sensuality wars against my reason; I have a cruel fight to keep the devil from my back</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Translated from Girolamo Savonarola, ''Lettere e scritti apologetici'' eds</span>
				<span class='text'>Ridolfi, Romano, Verde (Rome, 1984), p</span>
				<span class='text'>6</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; There is also a story that on the eve of his departure he dreamed that he was cleansed of such thoughts by a shower of icy water which prepared him for the ascetic life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;La Vita del Beato Girolamo Savonarola ed</span>
				<span class='text'>Roberto Ridolfi (Florence, 1937) p 8</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  In the unfinished treatise he left behind, later called &quot;De contemptu mundi,&quot; or &quot;On Contempt for the World,&quot; he calls upon readers to fly from this world of adultery, sodomy, murder and envy</span>
				<span class='text'>n April 25, 1475, Girolamo Savonarola went to [[Bologna]] where he knocked on the door of the Convent of San Domenico, of the Order of Friars Preachers, and asked to be admitted</span>
				<span class='text'>As he told his father in his farewell letter, he wanted to become a knight of Christ</span>
				<span class='text'>=Friar==In the convent, Savonarola took vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience and after a year was ordained to the priesthood</span>
				<span class='text'> He studied Scripture, logic, Aristotelian philosophy and [[Thomas Aquinas|Thomistic]] theology in the Dominican studium, practised preaching to his fellow friars and engaged in disputations</span>
				<span class='text'> He then matriculated in the theological faculty to prepare for an advanced degree</span>
				<span class='text'>Even as he continued to write devotional works and to deepen his spiritual life he was openly critical of what he perceived as the decline in convent austerity</span>
				<span class='text'> In 1478 his studies were interrupted when he was sent to the Dominican priory of Santa Maria degli Angeli in [[Ferrara]] as assistant master of novices</span>
				<span class='text'>The assignment might have been a normal, temporary break from the academic routine, but in Savonarola's case it was a turning point</span>
				<span class='text'>One explanation is that he had alienated certain of his superiors, particularly fra [[Vincenzo Bandello|Vincenzo Bandelli, or Bandello]], a professor at the studium and future master general of the Dominicans, who resented the young friar’s opposition to modifying the Order’s rules against the ownership of property</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In 1482, instead of returning to Bologna to resume his studies, Savonarola was assigned as lector, or teacher, in the [[Convent of San Marco]] in Florence</span>
				<span class='text'>n San Marco, fra Girolamo taught logic to the novices, wrote instructional manuals on ethics, logic, philosophy, and government, composed devotional works, and prepared his sermons for local congregations</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; As he recorded in his notes, his preaching was not altogether successful</span>
				<span class='text'> Florentines were put off by his foreign-sounding Ferrarese speech, his strident voice, and (especially to those who valued humanist rhetoric) his inelegant style</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;&quot;He satisfied almost no one either in his gestures or in his manner of speaking, as I who was there for all of Lent recall</span>
				<span class='text'> At the end there were fewer than twenty-five people, men, women and children</span>

				<span class='text'>11</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;While waiting for a friend in the Convent of San Giorgio he was studying Scripture when he suddenly conceived &quot;about seven reasons&quot; why the Church was about to be scourged and renewed</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  He broached these apocalyptic themes in [[San Gimignano]] where he went as Lenten preacher in 1485 and again in 1486, but a year later, when he left San Marco for a new assignment, he had said nothing of his &quot;San Giorgio revelations&quot; in Florence</span>

				<span class='text'>36–7&lt;/ref&gt;==Preacher==For the next several years Savonarola lived as an itinerant preacher with a message of [[repentance]] and reform in the cities and convents of north Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>As his letters to his mother and his writings show, his confidence and sense of mission grew along with his widening reputation</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In 1490, he was reassigned to San Marco</span>
				<span class='text'>It seems that this was due to the initiative of the humanist philosopher-prince, [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]], who had heard Savonarola in a formal disputation in [[Reggio Emilia]] and been impressed with his learning and piety</span>
				<span class='text'> Pico was in trouble with the Church for some of his unorthodox philosophical ideas (the famous &quot;900 theses&quot;) and was living under the protection of [[Lorenzo de' Medici|Lorenzo the Magnificent]], the Medici ''de facto'' ruler of Florence</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  To have Savonarola beside him as a spiritual counselor, he persuaded Lorenzo that the friar would bring prestige to the convent of San Marco and its Medici patrons</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tavuzzi, &quot;Savonarola and Vincenzo Bandello,&quot; 216-17</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  After some delay, apparently due to the interference of his former professor, fra [[Vincenzo Bandelli]], now Vicar General of the Order,  Lorenzo succeeded in bringing Savonarola back to Florence, where he arrived in May or June of that year</span>

				<span class='text'>Scoffers dismissed him as an over-excited zealot and &quot;preacher of the desperate&quot; and sneered at his growing band of followers as ''Piagioni'' – &quot;Weepers&quot; or &quot;Wailers&quot;, an epithet they adopted</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1492 Savonarola warned of &quot;the Sword of the Lord over the earth quickly and soon&quot; and envisioned terrible tribulations to Rome</span>
				<span class='text'> Around 1493 (these sermons have not survived) he began to prophesy that a New Cyrus was coming over the mountains to begin the renewal of the Church</span>

				<span class='text'>87–96</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In September 1494 King [[Charles VIII of France]] crossed the Alps with a formidable army, throwing Italy into political chaos</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;David Abulafia, The French Descent Into Renaissance Italy (Aldershot, 1995)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Many viewed the arrival of King Charles as proof of Savonarola's gift of prophecy</span>
				<span class='text'>Charles, however, advanced on Florence, sacking Tuscan strongholds and threatening to punish the city for refusing to support his expedition</span>
				<span class='text'>As the populace took to the streets to expel [[Piero the Unfortunate]], Lorenzo de' Medici's son and successor, Savonarola led a delegation to the camp of the French king in mid-November 1494</span>
				<span class='text'>He pressed Charles to spare Florence and enjoined him to take up his divinely appointed role as the reformer of the Church</span>
				<span class='text'> After a short, tense occupation of the city, and another intervention by fra Girolamo (as well as the promise of a huge subsidy), the French resumed their journey southward on November 28, 1494</span>
				<span class='text'> Savonarola now declared that by answering his call to penitence, the Florentines had begun to build a new Ark of Noah which had saved them from the waters of the divine flood</span>
				<span class='text'>ven more sensational was the message in his sermon of December 10:&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Donald Weinstein, Savonarola and Florence Prophecy and Patriotism in the Renaissance (Princeton University Press, 1970) 143</span>
				<span class='text'>On Florentine civic mythology, Nicolai Rubinstein, &quot;The Beginnings of Political Thought in Florence</span>

				<span class='text'>(Princeton University Press, 1966)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I announce this good news to the city, that Florence will be more glorious, richer, more powerful than she has ever been; First, glorious in the sight of God as well as of men: and you, O Florence will be the reformation of all Italy, and from here the renewal will begin and spread everywhere, because this is the navel of Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>Your counsels will reform all by the light and grace that God will give you</span>
				<span class='text'> Second, O Florence, you will have innumerable riches, and God will multiply all things for you</span>
				<span class='text'>Third, you will spread your empire, and thus you will have power temporal and spiritual</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This astounding guarantee may have been an allusion to the traditional patriotic myth of Florence as the new Rome, which Savonarola would have encountered in his readings in Florentine history</span>
				<span class='text'>In any case, it encompassed both temporal power and spiritual leadership</span>
				<span class='text'>=In Machiavelli's ''The Prince''==Discussed in Chapter VI of [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]'s book ''[[The Prince]]'' (&quot;Concerning New Principalities Which Are Acquired By One’s Own Arms And Ability&quot;), Fra Girolamo Savonarola was seen by Machiavelli as an incompetent, ill-prepared, and &quot;unarmed&quot; prophet, unlike &quot;Moses, Cyrus, Theseus, and Romulus&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;&quot;Concerning New Principalities Which Are Acquired By One’s Own Arms And Ability,&quot; ''The Prince'' by Machiavelli http://onetenthblog</span>
				<span class='text'>ordpress</span>
				<span class='text'>om/readings/machiavelli-the-prince-chapter-iv/&lt;/ref&gt;Of Savonarola, Machiavelli wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;If Moses, Cyrus, Theseus, and Romulus had been unarmed they could not have enforced their constitutions for long — as happened in our time to Fra Girolamo Savonarola, who was ruined with his new order of things immediately the multitude believed in him no longer, and he had no means of keeping steadfast those who believed or of making the unbelievers to believe</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;==Reformer==With Savonarola’s advice and support (as a non-citizen and cleric he was ineligible to hold office),  a Savonarolan political &quot;party,&quot; dubbed ‘the Frateschi,’ took shape and steered the friar’s program through the councils</span>
				<span class='text'>The oligarchs most compromised by their service to the Medici were barred from office</span>
				<span class='text'>A new constitution enfranchised the artisan class, opened minor civic offices to selection by lot and granted every citizen in good standing the right to a vote in a new parliament, the Consiglio Maggiore, or Great Council</span>
				<span class='text'>At Savonarola’s urging the Frateschi government, after months of debate, passed a &quot;Law of Appeal&quot; to limit the longtime practice of using exile and capital punishment as factional weapons</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;On Savonarola and Florentine constitutional reform see Felix Gilbert, &quot;Florentine Political Assumptions in the Period of Savonarola and Soderini,&quot; Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes XII (1957) 187–214, and Nicolai Rubinstein, &quot;Politics and Constitution in Florence at the End of the Fifteenth Century,&quot; Italian Renaissance Studies ed</span>

				<span class='text'>Jacob (London, 1963)</span>
				<span class='text'>The Frateschi’s success in blocking patricians from holding office has been questioned, most notably by Roslyn Cooper, &quot;The Florentine Ruling Group under the ‘Governo Popolare’, 1494–1512,&quot; Studies in Medieval and Renaissance History (1984/5) 71–181</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Savonarola declared a new era of &quot;universal peace</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; On January 13, 1495 he preached his great Renovation Sermon to a huge audience in the Cathedral, recalling that he had begun prophesying in Florence four years earlier, although the divine light had come to him &quot;more than fifteen, maybe twenty years ago</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He now claimed that he had predicted the deaths of [[Lorenzo de' Medici]] and of [[Pope Innocent VIII]] in 1492 and the coming of the sword to Italy—the invasion of King Charles of France</span>
				<span class='text'>As he had foreseen, God had chosen Florence, &quot;the navel of Italy&quot;, as his favorite and he repeated: if the city continued to do penance and began the work of renewal it would have riches, glory and power</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;English translation in Borelli, Passaro, Selected Writings of Girolamo Savonarola 59–76</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;If the Florentines had any doubt that the promise of worldly power and glory had heavenly sanction, Savonarola emphasized this in a sermon of April 1, 1495, in which he described his mystical journey to the Virgin Mary in heaven</span>
				<span class='text'>At the celestial throne Savonarola presents the Holy Mother a crown made by the Florentine people and presses her to reveal their future</span>
				<span class='text'> Mary warns that the way will be hard both for the city and for him, but she assures him that God will fulfill his promises: Florence will be &quot;more glorious, more powerful and richer than ever, extending its wings farther than anyone can imagine</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; She and her heavenly minions will protect the city against its enemies and support its alliance with the French</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Based on such visions, Savonarola promoted theocracy, and declared [[Christ]] the king of Florence</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;&quot;Political reform was only a part of the great task which Savonarola had set himself; his scheme embraced the renovation of social life, as well as science, literature, and art</span>
				<span class='text'>Christianity was to reassert its sovereignty over the paganism of the false renaissance in every department of life</span>
				<span class='text'>His 'Evviva Christo' was to echo from lip to lip</span>
				<span class='text'>Politics, society, science and art, were to have the commandments of God for their basis</span>

				<span class='text'>Thus the religious idea took form in politics, and a monarchy was to be erected by the democracy, under the immediate guidance of God; Savonarola, as the Daniel of the Florentines, was to be the medium of the Divine answers and commands</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;&quot;'It was not Art itself which he condemned, but its desecration, the introduction of earthly and even immodest sentiments and dress into sacred pictures</span>
				<span class='text'>On the contrary, pious and genuinely religious art would have been an efficacious support in building up that ideal State which he dreamt of, and for a while even made a reality</span>
				<span class='text'> Again and again Savonarola explains what he finds fault with in contemporary Art, and what he desires to put in place of it</span>

				<span class='text'>At his repeated insistence, new laws were passed against &quot;sodomy&quot; (which included male and female same-sex relations), adultery, public drunkenness, and other moral transgressions, while his lieutenant fra Silvestro Maruffi organized boys and young men to patrol the streets to curb immodest dress and behavior</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; For a time, [[Pope Alexander VI]] (1492–1503) tolerated friar Girolamo’s strictures against the Church, but he was moved to anger when Florence declined to join his new Holy League against the French invader, and blamed it on Savonarola’s pernicious influence</span>
				<span class='text'>An exchange of letters between the pope and the friar ended in an impasse which Savonarola tried to break by sending His Holiness &quot; a little book&quot; recounting his prophetic career and describing some of his more dramatic visions</span>
				<span class='text'>This was the Compendium of Revelations, a brilliant self-dramatization which was one of the farthest-reaching and most popular of his writings</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The pope was not mollified</span>
				<span class='text'>He summoned the friar to appear before him in Rome, and when Savonarola refused, pleading ill health and confessing that he was afraid of being attacked on the journey, Alexander banned him from further preaching</span>
				<span class='text'>For some months Savonarola obeyed, but when he saw his influence slipping he defied the pope and resumed his sermons, which became more violent in tone</span>
				<span class='text'>He not only attacked secret enemies at home whom he rightly suspected of being in league with the papal Curia, he condemned the conventional, or &quot;tepid&quot; Christians who were slow to respond to his calls</span>
				<span class='text'> He dramatized his moral campaign with special masses for the youth, processions, [[Bonfire of the Vanities|bonfires of the vanities]] and religious theater in San Marco</span>
				<span class='text'> He and his close friend, the humanist poet [[Girolamo Benivieni]], composed lauds and other devotional songs for the Carnival processions of 1496, 1497 and 1498, replacing the bawdy Carnival songs of the era of Lorenzo de’ Medici</span>

				<span class='text'>On March 18, 1498, after much debate and steady pressure from a worried government, he withdrew from public preaching</span>
				<span class='text'>Under the stress of excommunication, Savonarola composed his spiritual masterpiece, the ''Triumph of the Cross'', a celebration of the victory of the Cross over sin and death and an exploration of what it means to be a [[Christian]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Aftermath==Resisting censorship and exile, the friars of San Marco fostered a cult of &quot;the three martyrs&quot; and venerated Savonarola as a saint</span>
				<span class='text'>They encouraged women in local convents and surrounding towns to find mystical inspiration in his example,&lt;ref&gt;Lorenzo Polizzotto, &quot;When Saints Fall Out: Women and the Savonarolan Reform Movement in Early Sixteenth Century Florence,&quot; Renaissance Quarterly 46 (1993) 486–525; Sharon T</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The return of the [[House of Medici|Medici]] in 1512 ended the Savonarola-inspired republic and intensified pressure against the movement, although both were briefly revived in 1527 when the Medici were once again forced out</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cecil Roth, The Last Florentine Republic (London, 1925)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In 1530, however, [[Pope Clement VII]] (Giulio de’ Medici), with the help of soldiers of the Holy Roman Emperor, restored Medici rule, and Florence became an hereditary dukedom</span>
				<span class='text'>Piagnoni were silenced, hunted, tortured, imprisoned and exiled, and the movement, at least as a political force, came to an end</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|A plaque commemorates the site of Savonarola’s execution in the [[Piazza della Signoria]], [[Florence]]</span>
				<span class='text'>]Savonarolan religious ideas found a reception elsewhere</span>
				<span class='text'>In Germany and Switzerland the early Protestant reformers, most notably [[Martin Luther]] himself, read some of the friar’s writings and praised him as a martyr and forerunner whose ideas on faith and grace anticipated Luther’s own doctrine of justification by faith alone</span>
				<span class='text'> In France many of his works were translated and published and Savonarola came to be regarded as a precursor of evangelical, or [[Huguenot]] reform</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, Savonarola Rise and Fall, 360, note 26, drawing on works in German (Nolte) and Italian (Simoncelli and Dall’ Aglio)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Within the Dominican Order Savonarola was repackaged as an innocuous, purely devotional figure (&quot;the evolving image of a Counter-Reformation saintly prelate&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lorenzo Polizzotto, The Elect Nation p</span>
				<span class='text'>443</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;), and in this benevolent and unthreatening guise his memory lived on</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Philip Neri]], founder of the [[Oratory of Saint Philip Neri|Oratorians]], a Florentine who had been educated by the San Marco Dominicans, also defended Savonarola's memory</span>
				<span class='text'>n the mid-nineteenth century, the &quot;New Piagnoni&quot; found inspiration in the friar’s writings and sermons for the Italian national awakening known as the [[Risorgimento]]</span>
				<span class='text'>By emphasizing his political activism over his puritanism and cultural conservatism they restored Savonarola’s voice for radical political change</span>
				<span class='text'>The venerable Counter Reformation icon ceded to the fiery Renaissance reformer</span>
				<span class='text'>This somewhat anachronistic image, fortified by much new scholarship, informed the major new biography by [[Pasquale Villari]], who regarded Savonarola’s preaching against Medici despotism as the model for the Italian struggle for liberty and national unification</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pasquale Villari, ''The Life and Times of Girolamo Savonarola'' trans</span>
				<span class='text'>by Linda Villari 2 vols (New York, 1890)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, the Catholic theologian and church historian [[Joseph Schnitzer]] edited and published contemporary sources which illuminated Savonarola’s career</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1924 he crowned his vast research with a comprehensive study of Savonarola’s life and times in which he presented the friar as the last best hope of the Catholic Church before the catastrophe of the Protestant Reformation</span>

				<span class='text'>No English translation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Italian People's Party (1919)|Italian Popular Party]] founded by Don [[Luigi Sturzo]] in 1919, Savonarola was revered as a champion of social justice, and after 1945 he was held up as a model of reformed Catholicism by leaders of the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democratic Party]]</span>
				<span class='text'>From this milieu, in 1952, came the third of the major Savonarola biographies, the ''Vita di Girolamo Savonarola'' by [[Roberto di Ridolfi|Roberto Ridolfi]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Today, with most of Savonarola’s treatises and sermons and many of the contemporary sources (chronicles, diaries, government documents and literary works) available in critical editions, scholars can provide fresh, better informed assessments of his character and his place in the Renaissance, the Reformation and modern European history</span>
