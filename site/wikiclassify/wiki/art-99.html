				<span class='text'>He was educated as a chemist and employed as a scientist for 30 years</span>
				<span class='text'>Today he is appreciated largely for his contributions to logic, mathematics, philosophy, scientific methodology, and [[semiotics]], and for his founding of [[pragmatism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n innovator in mathematics, [[statistics]], philosophy, research methodology, and various sciences, Peirce considered himself,  first and foremost, a [[logic]]ian</span>
				<span class='text'>He made major contributions to logic, but logic for him encompassed much of that which is now called [[epistemology]] and [[philosophy of science]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He saw logic as the formal branch of [[semiotics]], of which he is a founder, and which foreshadowed the debate among [[logical positivists]] and proponents of [[philosophy of language]] that dominated 20th century Western philosophy; additionally, he defined the concept of [[abductive reasoning]], as well as rigorously formulated [[mathematical induction]] and [[deductive reasoning]]</span>
				<span class='text'>As early as 1886 he saw that [[logic gate|logical operations could be carried out by electrical switching circuits]]; the same idea was used decades later to produce digital computers</span>

				<span class='text'>He was the son of Sarah Hunt Mills and [[Benjamin Peirce]], himself a professor of [[astronomy]] and [[mathematics]] at [[Harvard University]] and perhaps the first serious research mathematician in America</span>
				<span class='text'>At age 12, Charles read his older brother's copy of [[Richard Whately]]'s ''Elements of Logic'', then the leading English-language text on the subject</span>
				<span class='text'>So began his lifelong fascination with logic and reasoning</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and otherwise his academic record was undistinguished</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;B:54–6&lt;/ref&gt; At Harvard, he began lifelong friendships with [[Francis Ellingwood Abbot]], [[Chauncey Wright]], and [[William James]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;B:363–4&lt;/ref&gt; One of his Harvard instructors, [[Charles William Eliot]], formed an unfavorable opinion of Peirce</span>
				<span class='text'>This opinion proved fateful, because Eliot, while President of Harvard 1869–1909—a period encompassing nearly all of Peirce's working life—repeatedly vetoed Harvard's employing Peirce in any capacity</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;B:19-20, 53, 75, 245&lt;/ref&gt;Peirce suffered from his late teens onward from a nervous condition then known as &quot;facial neuralgia&quot;, which would today be diagnosed as [[trigeminal neuralgia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Brent says that when in the throes of its pain &quot;he was, at first, almost stupefied, and then aloof, cold, depressed, extremely suspicious, impatient of the slightest crossing, and subject to violent outbursts of temper&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;B:40&lt;/ref&gt; Its consequences may have led to the social isolation which made his life's later years so tragic</span>
				<span class='text'>==Early employment===Between 1859 and 1891, Peirce was intermittently employed in various scientific capacities by the [[U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>National Geodetic Survey|United States Coast Survey]] and its successor, the [[United States Coast and Geodetic Survey]],&lt;ref name=Burch&gt;Burch, Robert (2001, 2010), &quot;[http://plato</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; where he enjoyed his highly influential father's protection&lt;ref&gt;B:139&lt;/ref&gt; until the latter's death in 1880</span>
				<span class='text'>That employment exempted Peirce from having to take part in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]; it would have been very awkward for him to do so, as the [[Boston Brahmin]] Peirces sympathized with the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;B:61-2&lt;/ref&gt; At the Survey, he worked mainly in [[geodesy]] and [[gravimetry]], refining the use of [[pendulum]]s to determine small local variations in the [[Earth]]'s [[gravity]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Burch/&gt;  He was elected a resident fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in January 1867</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;B:69&lt;/ref&gt; The Survey sent him to Europe five times,&lt;ref&gt;B:368&lt;/ref&gt; first in 1871 as part of a group sent to observe a [[solar eclipse]]; there, he sought out [[Augustus De Morgan]], [[William Stanley Jevons]], and [[William Kingdon Clifford]],&lt;ref&gt;B:79-81&lt;/ref&gt; British mathematicians and logicians whose turn of mind resembled his own</span>
				<span class='text'>From 1869 to 1872, he was employed as an Assistant in Harvard's astronomical observatory, doing important work on determining the brightness of [[star]]s and the shape of the [[Milky Way]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;B:367&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1877, he proposed measuring the [[meter]] as so many [[wavelength]]s of [[light]] of a certain [[frequency]],&lt;ref&gt;Fisch, Max (1983), &quot;Peirce as Scientist, Mathematician, Historian, Logician, and Philosopher&quot;, ''[[#SIL|Studies in Logic]]'' (new edition), see p</span>

				<span class='text'>uring the 1880s, Peirce's indifference to bureaucratic detail waxed while his Survey work's quality and timeliness waned</span>

				<span class='text'>==Johns Hopkins University===In 1879, Peirce was appointed Lecturer in logic at the new [[Johns Hopkins University]], which had strong departments in a number of areas that interested him, such as philosophy ([[Josiah Royce|Royce]] and [[John Dewey|Dewey]] completed their PhDs at Hopkins), psychology (taught by [[G</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;B:150–4, 195, 279–80, 289&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce's efforts may also have been hampered by a difficult personality; Brent conjectures as to further psychological difficulty</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;B:xv&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, [[Keith Devlin]] believes that Peirce's work was too far ahead of his time to be appreciated by the academic establishment of the day and that this played a large role in Peirce's inability to obtain a tenured position</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;B:150–1, 368&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years Peirce sought academic employment at various universities without success</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;In 1885 (B:369); in 1890 and 1900 (B:215, 273); in 1891 (B:215–16); and in 1892 (B:151–2, 222)</span>

				<span class='text'>Living beyond their means soon led to grave financial and legal difficulties</span>

				<span class='text'>om/menu/library/bycsp/newlist/nl-frame</span>
				<span class='text'>tm On a New List of Categories]&quot; to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], which published it the following year</span>
				<span class='text'>The paper outlined a theory of predication, involving three universal categories that Peirce developed in response to reading [[Aristotle]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], and [[Hegel]], categories that Peirce applied throughout his work for the rest of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Burch/&gt; Peirce scholars generally regard the &quot;New List&quot; as foundational or breaking the ground for Peirce's &quot;architectonic&quot;, his blueprint for a pragmatic philosophy</span>

				<span class='text'>He [[Classification of the sciences (Peirce)|divided]] logic into: (1) speculative grammar, or stechiology, on how signs can be meaningful and, in relation to that, what kinds of signs there are, how they combine, and how some embody or incorporate others; (2) logical critic, or logic proper, on the modes of inference; and (3) speculative or [[universal rhetoric]], or methodeutic,&lt;ref name=rhetoric/&gt; the philosophical theory of inquiry, including pragmatism</span>
				<span class='text'>===Presuppositions of logic====In his &quot;F</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot; [First Rule of Logic] (1899), Peirce states that the first, and &quot;in one sense, the sole&quot;, rule of reason is that, ''to learn, one needs to desire to learn'' and desire it without resting satisfied with that which one is inclined to think</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;FRL&quot;/&gt; So, the first rule is, ''to wonder''</span>
				<span class='text'>Peirce proceeds to a critical theme in research practices and the shaping of theories::</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>here follows one [[corollary]] which itself deserves to be inscribed upon every wall of the city of philosophy:&lt;center&gt;Do not block the way of inquiry</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/center&gt;Peirce adds, that method and economy are best in research but no outright sin inheres in trying any theory in the sense that the investigation via its trial adoption can proceed unimpeded and undiscouraged, and that &quot;the one unpardonable offence&quot; is a philosophical barricade against truth's advance, an offense to which &quot;metaphysicians in all ages have shown themselves the most addicted&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Peirce in many writings holds that [[Classification of the sciences (Peirce)|logic precedes metaphysics]] (ontological, religious, and physical)</span>
				<span class='text'>eirce goes on to list four common barriers to inquiry: (1) Assertion of absolute certainty; (2) maintaining that something is absolutely unknowable; (3) maintaining that something is absolutely inexplicable because absolutely basic or ultimate; (4) holding that perfect exactitude is possible, especially such as to quite preclude unusual and anomalous phenomena</span>
				<span class='text'>To refuse absolute theoretical certainty is the heart of ''fallibilism'', which Peirce unfolds into refusals to set up any of the listed barriers</span>
				<span class='text'>Peirce elsewhere argues (1897) that logic's presupposition of fallibilism leads at length to the view that chance and continuity are very real ([[tychism]] and [[synechism]])</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=FCE/&gt;The First Rule of Logic pertains to the mind's presuppositions in undertaking reason and logic, presuppositions, for instance, that truth and the real do not depend on yours or my opinion of them but do depend on representational relation and consist in the destined end in investigation taken far enough ([[#defs|see below]])</span>
				<span class='text'>He describes such ideas as, collectively, hopes which, in particular cases, one is unable seriously to doubt</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;====Logic as formal semiotic====Peirce sought, through his wide-ranging studies through the decades, formal philosophical ways to articulate thought's processes, and also to explain the workings of science</span>
				<span class='text'>These inextricably entangled questions of a dynamics of inquiry rooted in nature and nurture led him to develop his semiotic with very broadened conceptions of signs and inference, and, as its culmination, a theory of inquiry for the task of saying 'how science works' and devising research methods</span>
				<span class='text'>This would be logic by the medieval definition taught for centuries: art of arts, science of sciences, having the way to the principles of all methods</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=ars/&gt; Influences radiate from points on parallel lines of inquiry in [[Aristotle]]'s work, in such ''&lt;span lang=la&gt;loci&lt;/span&gt;'' as: the basic terminology of [[psychology]] in ''[[On the Soul]]''; the founding description of [[sign relation]]s in ''[[On Interpretation]]''; and the differentiation of [[inference]] into three modes that are commonly translated into English as ''[[Abductive reasoning|abduction]]'', ''[[Deductive reasoning|deduction]]'', and ''[[Inductive reasoning|induction]]'', in the ''[[Prior Analytics]]'', as well as inference by [[analogy]] (called ''&lt;span lang=grc&gt;paradeigma&lt;/span&gt;'' by Aristotle), which Peirce regarded as involving the other three modes</span>
				<span class='text'>eirce began writing on semiotic in the 1860s, around the time when he devised his system of three categories</span>
				<span class='text'>He called it both ''[[semiotic]]'' and ''semeiotic''</span>
				<span class='text'>Both are current in singular and plural</span>
				<span class='text'>He based it on the conception of a triadic [[sign relation]], and defined ''[[semiosis]]'' as &quot;action, or influence, which is, or involves, a cooperation of ''three'' subjects, such as a sign, its object, and its interpretant, this tri-relative influence not being in any way resolvable into actions between pairs&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Reprinted, EP 2:411 in &quot;Pragmatism&quot; (398–433)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; As to signs in thought, Peirce emphasized the reverse:{{quote|To say, therefore, that thought cannot happen in an instant, but requires a time, is but another way of saying that every thought must be interpreted in another, or that all thought is in signs</span>
				<span class='text'>Peirce 1868</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=QFM/&gt;}}Peirce held that all thought is in signs, issuing in and from interpretation, where 'sign' is the word for the broadest variety of conceivable semblances, diagrams, metaphors, symptoms, signals, designations, symbols, texts, even mental concepts and ideas, all as determinations of a mind or ''quasi-mind'', that which at least functions like a mind, as in the work of crystals or bees&lt;ref&gt;See &quot;[http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>Logic is ''formal semiotic''</span>
				<span class='text'>A sign is something, ''A'', which brings something, ''B'', its ''interpretant'' sign, determined or created by it, into the same sort of correspondence (or a lower implied sort) with something, ''C'', its ''object'', as that in which itself stands to ''C''</span>
				<span class='text'>This definition no more involves any reference to human thought than does the definition of a line as the place within which a particle lies during a lapse of time</span>
				<span class='text'>It is from this definition that I deduce the principles of logic by mathematical reasoning, and by mathematical reasoning that, I aver, will support criticism of [[Weierstrass]]ian severity, and that is perfectly evident</span>

				<span class='text'>===Sign relation====Peirce's theory of signs is known to be one of the most complex semiotic theories due to its generalistic claim</span>
				<span class='text'>Anything is a sign — not absolutely as itself, but instead in some relation or other</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''[[sign relation]]'' is the key</span>
				<span class='text'>It defines three roles encompassing (1) the sign, (2) the sign's subject matter, called its ''object'', and (3) the sign's meaning or ramification as formed into a kind of effect called its ''interpretant'' (a further sign, for example a translation)</span>
				<span class='text'>It is an irreducible ''[[triadic relation]]'', according to Peirce</span>
				<span class='text'>The roles are distinct even when the things that fill those roles are not</span>
				<span class='text'>The roles are but three; a sign of an object leads to one or more interpretants, and, as signs, they lead to further interpretants</span>
				<span class='text'>'Extension × intension = information</span>
				<span class='text'>' Two traditional approaches to sign relation, necessary though insufficient, are the way of ''[[Extension (semantics)|extension]]'' (a sign's objects, also called breadth, denotation, or application) and the way of ''[[intension]]'' (the objects' characteristics, qualities, attributes referenced by the sign, also called depth, [[Comprehension (logic)|comprehension]], significance, or connotation)</span>
				<span class='text'>Peirce adds a third, the way of ''[[Logic of information|information]]'', including change of information, to integrate the other two approaches into a unified whole</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1867), &quot;Upon Logical Comprehension and Extension&quot; (CP 2</span>

				<span class='text'>du/~peirce/writings/v2/w2/w2_06/v2_06</span>
				<span class='text'>tm W 2:70–86])</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; For example, because of the equation above, if a term's total amount of information stays the same, then the more that the term 'intends' or signifies about objects, the fewer are the objects to which the term 'extends' or applies</span>
				<span class='text'>'Determination</span>
				<span class='text'>' A sign depends on its object in such a way as to represent its object — the object enables and, in a sense, determines the sign</span>
				<span class='text'>A physically causal sense of this stands out when a sign consists in an indicative reaction</span>
				<span class='text'>The interpretant depends likewise on both the sign and the object — an object determines a sign to determine an interpretant</span>
				<span class='text'>But this determination is not a succession of dyadic events, like a row of toppling dominoes; sign determination is triadic</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, an interpretant does not merely represent something which represented an object; instead an interpretant represents something ''as'' a sign representing the object</span>
				<span class='text'>The object (be it a quality or fact or law or even fictional) determines the sign to an interpretant through one's collateral experience&lt;ref name=collateral&gt;See pp</span>

				<span class='text'>An object either (i) is ''immediate'' to a sign and is the object as represented in the sign or (ii) is a ''dynamic'' object, the object as it really is, on which the immediate object is founded &quot;as on bedrock&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;# An ''[[interpretant]]'' (or ''interpretant sign'') is a sign's meaning or ramification as formed into a kind of idea or effect, an interpretation, human or otherwise</span>
				<span class='text'>An interpretant is a sign (a) of the object and (b) of the interpretant's &quot;predecessor&quot; (the interpreted sign) as a sign of the same object</span>
				<span class='text'>An interpretant either (i) is ''immediate'' to a sign and is a kind of quality or possibility such as a word's usual meaning, or (ii) is a ''dynamic'' interpretant, such as a state of agitation, or (iii) is a ''final'' or ''normal'' interpretant, a sum of the lessons which a sufficiently considered sign ''would'' have as effects on practice, and with which an actual interpretant may at most coincide</span>
				<span class='text'>ome of the understanding needed by the mind depends on familiarity with the object</span>
				<span class='text'>To know what a given sign denotes, the mind needs some experience of that sign's object, experience outside of, and collateral to, that sign or sign system</span>
				<span class='text'>In that context Peirce speaks of collateral experience, collateral observation, collateral acquaintance, all in much the same terms</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=collateral/&gt;====Classes of signs====Among Peirce's many sign typologies, three stand out, interlocked</span>
				<span class='text'>The first typology depends on the sign itself, the second on how the sign stands for its denoted object, and the third on how the sign stands for its object to its interpretant</span>
				<span class='text'>Also, each of the three typologies is a three-way division, a [[Trichotomy (philosophy)|trichotomy]], via Peirce's three phenomenological [[#Theory of categories|categories]]: (1) quality of feeling, (2) reaction, resistance, and (3) representation, mediation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=9signs/&gt;I</span>
				<span class='text'>''Qualisign, sinsign, legisign'' (also called'' tone, token, type,'' and also called ''potisign, actisign, famisign''):&lt;ref name=terms&gt;On the varying terminology, look up in [http://www</span>
				<span class='text'>elsinki</span>
				<span class='text'>i/science/commens/dictionary</span>
				<span class='text'>tml CDPT]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This typology classifies every sign according to the sign's own phenomenological category—the qualisign is a quality, a possibility, a &quot;First&quot;; the sinsign is a reaction or resistance, a singular object, an actual event or fact, a &quot;Second&quot;; and the legisign is a habit, a rule, a representational relation, a &quot;Third&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>I</span>
				<span class='text'>''Icon, index, symbol'': This typology, the best known one, classifies every sign according to the category of the sign's way of denoting its object—the icon (also called semblance or likeness) by a quality of its own, the index by factual connection to its object, and the symbol by a habit or rule for its interpretant</span>
				<span class='text'>II</span>
				<span class='text'>''Rheme, dicisign, argument'' (also called ''sumisign, dicisign, suadisign,'' also ''seme, pheme, delome,''&lt;ref name=terms/&gt; and regarded as very broadened versions of the traditional ''term, proposition, argument''): This typology classifies every sign according to the category which the interpretant attributes to the sign's way of denoting its object—the rheme, for example a term, is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of quality; the dicisign, for example a proposition, is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of fact; and the argument is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of habit or law</span>
				<span class='text'>This is the culminating typology of the three, where the sign is understood as a structural element of inference</span>
				<span class='text'>{C</span>
				<span class='text'>S</span>
				<span class='text'>Peirce ninefold sign table}}Every sign belongs to one class or another within (I) ''and'' within (II) ''and'' within (III)</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus each of the three typologies is a three-valued parameter for every sign</span>
				<span class='text'>The three parameters are not independent of each other; many co-classifications are absent, for reasons pertaining to the lack of either habit-taking or singular reaction in a quality, and the lack of habit-taking in a singular reaction</span>
				<span class='text'>The result is not 27 but instead ten classes of signs fully specified at this level of analysis</span>
				<span class='text'>==Modes of inference==={{Main|Inquiry}}Borrowing a brace of concepts from [[Aristotle]], Peirce examined three basic modes of [[inference]] — ''[[abductive reasoning|abduction]]'', ''[[deductive reasoning|deduction]]'', and ''[[Inductive reasoning|induction]]'' — in his &quot;critique of arguments&quot; or &quot;logic proper&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Peirce also called abduction &quot;retroduction&quot;, &quot;presumption&quot;, and, earliest of all, &quot;hypothesis&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He characterized it as guessing and as inference to an explanatory hypothesis</span>
				<span class='text'>He sometimes expounded the modes of inference by transformations of the categorical [[Syllogism#Barbara (AAA-1)|syllogism Barbara (AAA)]], for example in &quot;Deduction, Induction, and Hypothesis&quot; (1878)</span>

				<span class='text'>{col-end}}Peirce 1883 in &quot;A Theory of Probable Inference&quot; (''[[#SIL|Studies in Logic]]'') equated hypothetical inference with the induction of characters of objects (as he had done in effect before&lt;ref name=SCFI/&gt;)</span>
				<span class='text'>Eventually dissatisfied, by 1900 he distinguished them once and for all and also wrote that he now took the syllogistic forms and the doctrine of logical extension and comprehension as being less basic than he had thought</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In his [[methodeutic]] or theory of inquiry (see below), he portrayed abduction as an economic initiative to further inference and study, and portrayed all three modes as clarified by their coordination in essential roles in inquiry: hypothetical explanation, deductive prediction, inductive testing</span>

				<span class='text'>Here is one of his more [[Pragmatic maxim#2|emphatic reiterations]] of it:{{quote|Consider what effects that might ''conceivably'' have practical bearings you ''conceive'' the objects of your ''conception'' to have</span>
				<span class='text'>Then, your ''conception'' of those effects is the whole of your ''conception'' of the object</span>
				<span class='text'>}As a movement, pragmatism began in the early 1870s in discussions among Peirce, [[William James]], and others in [[the Metaphysical Club]]</span>
				<span class='text'>James among others regarded some articles by Peirce such as &quot;[[s:The Fixation of Belief|The Fixation of Belief]]&quot; (1877) and especially &quot;[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How to Make Our Ideas Clear]]&quot; (1878) as foundational to [[pragmatism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;James, William (1897), ''The Will to Believe'', see p</span>
				<span class='text'>124</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Peirce (CP 5</span>
				<span class='text'>1–12), like James (''[[s:Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking|Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking]]'', 1907), saw pragmatism as embodying familiar attitudes, in philosophy and elsewhere, elaborated into a new deliberate method for fruitful thinking about problems</span>
				<span class='text'>Peirce differed from James and the early [[John Dewey]], in some of their tangential enthusiasms, in being decidedly more rationalistic and realistic, in several senses of those terms, throughout the preponderance of his own philosophical moods</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1905 Peirce coined the new name [[pragmaticism]] &quot;for the precise purpose of expressing the original definition&quot;, saying that &quot;all went happily&quot; with James's and [[F</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Schiller]]'s variant uses of the old name &quot;pragmatism&quot; and that he coined the new name because of the old name's growing use in &quot;literary journals, where it gets abused&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet he cited as causes, in a 1906 manuscript, his differences with James and Schiller and, in a 1908 publication, his differences with James as well as literary author [[Giovanni Papini]]'s declaration of pragmatism's indefinability</span>
				<span class='text'>Peirce in any case regarded his views that truth is immutable and infinity is real, as being opposed by the other pragmatists, but he remained allied with them on other issues</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See [[Pragmaticism#Pragmaticism's name]] for discussion and references</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Pragmatism begins with the idea that belief is that on which one is prepared to act</span>
				<span class='text'>Peirce's pragmatism is a method of clarification of conceptions of objects</span>
				<span class='text'>It equates any conception of an object to a conception of that object's effects to a general extent of the effects' conceivable implications for informed practice</span>
				<span class='text'>It is a method of sorting out conceptual confusions occasioned, for example, by distinctions that make (sometimes needed) formal yet not practical differences</span>
				<span class='text'>He formulated both pragmatism and statistical principles as aspects of scientific logic, in his &quot;Illustrations of the Logic of Science&quot; series of articles</span>
				<span class='text'>In the second one, &lt;span id=defs&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot;[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How to Make Our Ideas Clear]]&quot;, Peirce discussed three grades of clearness of conception:# Clearness of a conception familiar and readily used, even if unanalyzed and undeveloped</span>
				<span class='text'> Clearness of a conception in virtue of clearness of its parts, in virtue of which logicians called an idea &quot;distinct&quot;, that is, clarified by analysis of just what makes it applicable</span>
				<span class='text'>Elsewhere, echoing Kant, Peirce called a likewise distinct definition &quot;nominal&quot; (CP 5</span>
				<span class='text'>53)</span>
				<span class='text'> Clearness in virtue of clearness of conceivable practical implications of the object's conceived effects, such as fosters fruitful reasoning, especially on difficult problems</span>
				<span class='text'>Here he introduced that which he later called the [[pragmatic maxim]]</span>
				<span class='text'>y way of example of how to clarify conceptions, he addressed conceptions about truth and the real as questions of the [[#Presuppositions of logic|presuppositions of reasoning]] in general</span>
				<span class='text'>In clearness's second grade (the &quot;nominal&quot; grade), he defined truth as a sign's correspondence to its object, and the real as the object of such correspondence, such that truth and the real are independent of that which you or I or any actual, definite [[Community of inquiry|community of inquirers]] think</span>
				<span class='text'>After that needful but confined step, next in clearness's third grade (the pragmatic, practice-oriented grade) he defined truth as that opinion which ''would'' be reached, sooner or later but still inevitably, by research taken far enough, such that the real does depend on that ideal final opinion—a dependence to which he appeals in theoretical arguments elsewhere, for instance for the long-run validity of the rule of induction</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Induction&gt;&quot;That the rule of induction will hold good in the long run may be deduced from the principle that reality is only the object of the final opinion to which sufficient investigation would lead&quot;, in Peirce (1878 April), &quot;The Probability of Induction&quot;, p</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Peirce argued that even to argue against the independence and discoverability of truth and the real is to presuppose that there is, about that very question under argument, a truth with just such independence and discoverability</span>
				<span class='text'>eirce said that a conception's meaning consists in &quot;[[Pragmatic maxim#2|all general modes of rational conduct]]&quot; implied by &quot;acceptance&quot; of the conception—that is, if one were to accept, first of all, the conception as true, then what could one conceive to be consequent general modes of rational conduct by all who accept the conception as true?—the whole of such consequent general modes is the whole meaning</span>
				<span class='text'>His pragmatism does not equate a conception's meaning, its intellectual purport, with the conceived benefit or cost of the conception itself, like a meme (or, say, propaganda), outside the perspective of its being true, nor, since a conception is general, is its meaning equated with any definite set of actual consequences or upshots corroborating or undermining the conception or its worth</span>
				<span class='text'>His pragmatism also bears no resemblance to &quot;vulgar&quot; pragmatism, which misleadingly connotes a ruthless and [[Machiavelli]]an search for mercenary or political advantage</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; treated by Peirce as a consequence of his pragmatism, is his combination of [[Scottish School of Common Sense|Thomas Reid's common-sense philosophy]] with a [[fallibilism]] that recognizes that propositions of our more or less vague common sense now indubitable may later come into question, for example because of transformations of our world through science</span>
				<span class='text'>It includes efforts to work up in tests genuine doubts for a core group of common indubitables that vary slowly if at all</span>
				<span class='text'>====Rival methods of inquiry=====In [[s:The Fixation of Belief|The Fixation of Belief]] (1877), Peirce described inquiry in general not as the pursuit of truth ''per se'' but as the struggle to move from irritating, inhibitory doubt born of surprise, disagreement, and the like, and to reach a secure belief, belief being that on which one is prepared to act</span>
				<span class='text'>That let Peirce frame scientific inquiry as part of a broader spectrum and as spurred, like inquiry generally, by actual doubt, not mere verbal, quarrelsome, or [[hyperbolic doubt]], which he held to be fruitless</span>
				<span class='text'>Peirce sketched '''four methods''' of settling opinion, ordered from least to most successful:# The method of '''tenacity''' (policy of sticking to initial belief) — which brings comforts and decisiveness but leads to trying to ignore contrary information and others' views as if truth were intrinsically private, not public</span>
				<span class='text'>The method goes against the social impulse and easily falters since one may well notice when another's opinion seems as good as one's own initial opinion</span>
				<span class='text'>Its successes can be brilliant but tend to be transitory</span>
				<span class='text'> The method of '''authority''' — which overcomes disagreements but sometimes brutally</span>
				<span class='text'>Its successes can be majestic and long-lasting, but it cannot regulate people thoroughly enough to withstand doubts indefinitely, especially when people learn about other societies present and past</span>
				<span class='text'> The method of the '''''a priori''''' — which promotes conformity less brutally but fosters opinions as something like tastes, arising in conversation and comparisons of perspectives in terms of &quot;what is agreeable to reason</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Thereby it depends on fashion in [[paradigm]]s and goes in circles over time</span>
				<span class='text'>It is more intellectual and respectable but, like the first two methods, sustains accidental and capricious beliefs, destining some minds to doubt it</span>
				<span class='text'> The method of '''science''' — wherein inquiry supposes that the real is discoverable but independent of particular opinion, such that, unlike in the other methods, inquiry can, by its own account, go wrong ([[fallibilism]]), not only right, and thus purposely tests itself and criticizes, corrects, and improves itself</span>
				<span class='text'>eirce held that, in practical affairs, slow and stumbling ratiocination is often dangerously inferior to instinct and traditional sentiment, and that the scientific method is best suited to theoretical research,&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, &quot;Philosophy and the Conduct of Life&quot;, Lecture 1 of the 1898 Cambridge (MA) Conferences Lectures, CP 1</span>
				<span class='text'>16–48 in part and ''[[#RLT|Reasoning and the Logic of Things]]'', 105–22, reprinted in EP 2:27–41</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; which in turn should not be trammeled by the other methods and practical ends; reason's &quot;first rule&quot;&lt;ref name=FRL/&gt; is that, in order to learn, one must desire to learn and, as a corollary, must not block the way of inquiry</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Scientific method]] excels the others finally by being deliberately designed to arrive — eventually — at the most secure beliefs, upon which the most successful practices can be based</span>
				<span class='text'>Starting from the idea that people seek not truth ''per se'' but instead to subdue irritating, inhibitory doubt, Peirce showed how, through the struggle, some can come to submit to truth for the sake of belief's integrity, seek as truth the guidance of potential conduct correctly to its given goal, and wed themselves to the scientific method</span>
				<span class='text'>====Scientific method=====Insofar as clarification by pragmatic reflection suits explanatory hypotheses and fosters predictions and testing, pragmatism points beyond the usual duo of foundational alternatives: [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]] from self-evident truths, or ''[[rationalism]]''; and [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] from experiential phenomena, or ''[[empiricism]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>ased on his critique of three [[#Modes of inference|modes of argument]] and different from either [[foundationalism]] or [[coherentism]], Peirce's approach seeks to justify claims by a three-phase dynamic of inquiry:# Active, [[Abductive reasoning|abductive]] genesis of theory, with no prior assurance of truth;# Deductive application of the contingent theory so as to clarify its practical implications;# Inductive testing and evaluation of the utility of the provisional theory in anticipation of future experience, in both senses: ''[[prediction]]'' and ''control''</span>
				<span class='text'>hereby, Peirce devised an approach to inquiry far more solid than the flatter image of inductive generalization ''&lt;span lang=la&gt;simpliciter&lt;/span&gt;'', which is a mere re-labeling of phenomenological patterns</span>
				<span class='text'>Peirce's pragmatism was the first time the [[scientific method]] was proposed as an [[epistemology]] for philosophical questions</span>
				<span class='text'> theory that succeeds better than its rivals in predicting and controlling our world is said to be nearer the truth</span>
				<span class='text'>This is an operational notion of truth used by scientists</span>
				<span class='text'>eirce extracted the pragmatic [[mental model|model]] or [[theory]] of inquiry from its raw materials in classical logic and refined it in parallel with the early development of symbolic logic to address problems about the nature of scientific reasoning</span>
				<span class='text'>bduction, deduction, and induction make incomplete sense in isolation from one another but comprise a cycle understandable as a whole insofar as they collaborate toward the common end of inquiry</span>
				<span class='text'>In the pragmatic way of thinking about conceivable practical implications, every thing has a purpose, and, as possible, its purpose should first be denoted</span>
				<span class='text'>Abduction hypothesizes an explanation for deduction to clarify into implications to be tested so that induction can evaluate the hypothesis, in the struggle to move from troublesome uncertainty to more secure belief</span>
				<span class='text'>No matter how traditional and needful it is to study the modes of inference in abstraction from one another, the integrity of inquiry strongly limits the effective [[modularity (programming)|modularity]] of its principal components</span>

				<span class='text'>Guessing, inference to explanatory hypotheses for selection of those best worth trying</span>
				<span class='text'>From abduction, Peirce distinguishes induction as inferring, on the basis of tests, the proportion of truth in the hypothesis</span>
				<span class='text'>Every inquiry, whether into ideas, brute facts, or norms and laws, arises from surprising observations in one or more of those realms (and for example at any stage of an inquiry already underway)</span>
				<span class='text'>All explanatory content of theories comes from abduction, which guesses a new or outside idea so as to account in a simple, economical way for a surprising or complicated phenomenon</span>
				<span class='text'>The modicum of success in our guesses far exceeds that of random luck, and seems born of attunement to nature by developed or inherent instincts, especially insofar as best guesses are optimally plausible and simple in the sense of the &quot;facile and natural&quot;, as by [[Galileo]]'s natural light of reason and as distinct from &quot;logical simplicity&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>'''Inductive''' phase</span>
				<span class='text'>Evaluation of the hypothesis, inferring from observational or experimental tests of its deduced consequences</span>
				<span class='text'>The long-run validity of the rule of induction is deducible from the principle (presuppositional to reasoning in general) that the real &quot;is only the object of the final opinion to which sufficient investigation would lead&quot;;&lt;ref name=Induction/&gt; in other words, anything excluding such a process would never be real</span>
				<span class='text'>Induction involving the ongoing accumulation of evidence follows &quot;a method which, sufficiently persisted in,&quot; will &quot;diminish the error below any predesignate degree</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Three stages::i</span>

				<span class='text'>ii</span>
				<span class='text'>Probation: direct Inductive Argumentation</span>
				<span class='text'>Crude or Gradual in procedure</span>
				<span class='text'>Crude Induction, founded on experience in one mass (CP 2</span>
				<span class='text'>59), presumes that future experience on a question will not differ utterly from all past experience (CP 2</span>
				<span class='text'>56)</span>
				<span class='text'>Gradual Induction makes a new estimate of the proportion of truth in the hypothesis after each test, and is Qualitative or Quantitative</span>
				<span class='text'>Qualitative Gradual Induction depends on estimating the relative evident weights of the various qualities of the subject class under investigation (CP 2</span>
				<span class='text'>59; see also CP 7</span>
				<span class='text'>14–20)</span>
				<span class='text'>Quantitative Gradual Induction depends on how often, in a fair sample of instances of ''S'', ''S'' is found actually accompanied by ''P'' that was predicted for ''S'' (CP 2</span>

				<span class='text'>====Against Cartesianism=====Peirce drew on the methodological implications of the [[#Four incapacities|four incapacities]] — no genuine introspection, no intuition in the sense of non-inferential cognition, no thought but in signs, and no conception of the absolutely incognizable — to attack philosophical [[René Descartes|Cartesianism]], of which he said that:&lt;ref name=SCFI /&gt;1</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;It teaches that philosophy must begin in universal doubt&quot; — when, instead, we start with preconceptions, &quot;prejudices [</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> which it does not occur to us ''can'' be questioned&quot;, though we may find reason to question them later</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Let us not pretend to doubt in philosophy what we do not doubt in our hearts</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;2</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;It teaches that the ultimate test of certainty is</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>n the individual consciousness&quot; — when, instead, in science a theory stays on probation till agreement is reached, then it has no actual doubters left</span>
				<span class='text'>No lone individual can reasonably hope to fulfill philosophy's multi-generational dream</span>
				<span class='text'>When &quot;candid and disciplined minds&quot; continue to disagree on a theoretical issue, even the theory's author should feel doubts about it</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>It trusts to &quot;a single thread of inference depending often upon inconspicuous premisses&quot; — when, instead, philosophy should, &quot;like the successful sciences&quot;, proceed only from tangible, scrutinizable premisses and trust not to any one argument but instead to &quot;the multitude and variety of its arguments&quot; as forming, not a chain at least as weak as its weakest link, but &quot;a cable whose fibers&quot;, soever &quot;slender, are sufficiently numerous and intimately connected&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>We know in advance of experience that certain things are not true, because we see they are impossible</span>
				<span class='text'>} Peirce retained, as useful for some purposes, the definitions in terms of information states, but insisted that the pragmaticist is committed to a strong modal realism by conceiving of objects in terms of predictive general conditional propositions about how they ''would'' behave under certain circumstances</span>
