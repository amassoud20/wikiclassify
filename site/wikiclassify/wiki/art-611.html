				<span class='text'>He did not use ''[[House of Bernadotte|Bernadotte]]'' in Sweden but founded the royal dynasty there by that name</span>
				<span class='text'>rench by birth, Bernadotte served a long career in the [[French Army]]</span>

				<span class='text'>His service to France ended in 1810, when he was elected the [[heir-presumptive]] to the Swedish throne because the [[House of Holstein-Gottorp (Swedish line)|Swedish royal family]] was dying out with King [[Charles XIII of Sweden|Charles XIII]]</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}}  Following the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]], his eminent military qualities brought him speedy promotion</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}} He was promoted by 1794 brigadier, attached to the [[Army of Sambre-et-Meuse]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}} After [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan|Jourdan]]'s victory at [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|Fleurus]] (26 June 1794) he became a general of division</span>
				<span class='text'>At the [[Battle of Theiningen]] (1796), Bernadotte contributed, more than anyone else, to the successful retreat of the French army over the [[Rhine]] after its defeat by the [[Archduke Charles of Austria]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1797 he brought reinforcements from the Rhine to [[Napoleon I of France|Bonaparte]]'s army in [[Italy]], distinguishing himself greatly at the passage of the [[Tagliamento]], and in 1798 served as ambassador to [[Vienna]], but had to quit his post owing to the disturbances caused by his hoisting the [[Flag of France|tricolour]] over the [[embassy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}}From 2 July to 14 September he was [[List of Defence Ministers of France|Minister of War]], in which capacity he displayed great ability</span>
				<span class='text'>He declined to help Napoleon Bonaparte stage his ''[[coup d'état]]'' of November 1799, but nevertheless accepted employment from the [[French Consulate|Consulate]], and from April 1800 to 18 August 1801 commanded the army in the [[Vendée]]</span>

				<span class='text'>]On the introduction of the [[First French Empire]], Bernadotte became one of the eighteen [[Marshal of the Empire|Marshals of the Empire]] and, from June 1804 to September 1805, served as governor of the recently occupied [[Hanover]]</span>
				<span class='text'>During the campaign of 1805, Bernadotte with an army corps from Hanover, co-operated in the great movement which resulted in the shutting off of [[Karl Mack von Leiberich|Mack]] in [[Battle of Ulm|Ulm]]</span>
				<span class='text'>As a reward for his services at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] (2 December 1805) he became the 1st Sovereign [[Prince]] of [[Ponte Corvo]] (5 June 1806), but during the campaign against [[Prussia]], in the same year, was severely reproached by Napoleon for not participating with his army corps in the battles of [[Battle of Jena|Jena]] and [[Battle of Auerstädt|Auerstädt]], though close at hand</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bain|1911|p=932}}In 1808, as governor of the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic towns]], he was to have directed the expedition against Sweden, via the [[Denmark|Danish]] islands, but the plan came to naught because of the want of transports and the defection of the [[Division of the North|Spanish contingent]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In the war against Austria, Bernadotte led the [[Saxony|Saxon]] contingent at the [[Battle of Wagram]] (6 July 1809), on which occasion, on his own initiative, he issued an [[Order of the Day]] attributing the victory principally to the valour of his Saxons, which order Napoleon at once disavowed</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bain|1911|p=932}} It was during the middle of that battle that Marshal Bernadotte was stripped of his command after retreating contrary to Napoleon's orders</span>
				<span class='text'>Napoleon remarked on St</span>
				<span class='text'>Helena, &quot;I can accuse him of ingratitude but not treachery&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Barton|1921|p= }}{{page needed|date=June 2014}}==Conspiracy of Rennes/Plot of Placards &amp; the Governor of Louisiana==Bernadotte was one of the worst malcontents in the French general staff, and this was well known to Napoleon</span>
				<span class='text'> In the early summer of 1802, Bernadotte's chief-of-staff was caught leading a conspiracy to whip up a revolt among the large numbers of troops that were being concentrated in Rennes, Brittany</span>
				<span class='text'> These conscripts were soon to be dispatched to the West Indies, where it was well known that most Europeans were dying from [[Yellow Fever]]</span>
				<span class='text'>  Though the plot was uncovered before much more had been achieved than the distribution of seditious handbills and placards, it had still been frightening enough for Napoleon; he initially threatened to have Bernadotte shot, but he wisely backed away after [[Joseph Bonaparte]], Bernadotte's brother-in-law, successfully convinced his younger brother that there was no evidence directly linking Bernadotte with the conspiracy</span>
				<span class='text'> Nevertheless, Bernadotte remained ''persona non grata'' at the Consulate and kept a low profile by residing in [[Plombières-les-Bains]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n September 1802, Napoleon considered who would make a suitable governor for the retrocession of [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]], effective on 15 October 1802</span>
				<span class='text'> Bernadotte seemed to be the perfect candidate for this virtual exile; he accepted, and he and his family made preparations to depart from [[La Rochelle]]</span>
				<span class='text'> On the day of Bernadotte's scheduled departure, April 12, 1803, James Monroe arrived in Paris to close the deal on the [[Louisiana Purchase]]</span>
				<span class='text'> When Bernadotte's party arrived in La Rochelle, confusion ensued for many days as the ship charted to take them to Louisiana was counter-ordered to carry General [[Jean Augustin Ernouf]] to his appointment of governor general of the French colony in [[Saint-Domingue]] and [[Guadeloupe]] following the suppression of a sudden widespread slave insurrection</span>
				<span class='text'> A second possible ship was recalled to convey supplies to the army in Saint Domingue</span>
				<span class='text'> While organizing a third vessel to take him to Louisiana, Parisian newspapers had reached Bernadotte announcing the surprise conclusion of the Louisiana Purchase</span>
				<span class='text'> Bernadotte was waiting in La Rochelle for clarification from the Consulate on May 16, when Britain declared war on France</span>
				<span class='text'> On May 27, Bernadotte sent a letter to Napoleon through Joseph resigning his Louisianan appointment and asking for an army for the impending [[War of the Third Coalition]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Under pressure from Joseph, Napoleon acquiesced, but still did not send orders to Bernadotte for over a year</span>

				<span class='text'>]Bernadotte, considerably piqued, returned to Paris where the council of ministers entrusted him with the defence of the [[Netherlands]] against the British expedition in [[Walcheren Campaign|Walcheren]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1810, he was about to enter upon his new post as governor of [[Rome]] when he was unexpectedly elected the heir-presumptive to King [[Charles XIII of Sweden|Charles XIII]] of [[Sweden]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bain|1911|p=932}}  The problem of Charles' successor had been acute almost from the time he had ascended the throne a year earlier, as it was apparent that the Swedish branch of the House of Holstein-Gottorp would die with him</span>
				<span class='text'> He was 61 years old and in failing health</span>
				<span class='text'> He was also childless; [[Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp|Queen Charlotte]] had given birth to two children who had died in infancy, and there was no prospect of her bearing another child</span>
				<span class='text'> The king had adopted a Danish prince, [[Charles August, Crown Prince of Sweden|Charles August]], as his son soon after his coronation, but he had died just a few months after his arrival</span>

				<span class='text'>ritannica</span>
				<span class='text'>om/EBchecked/topic/107273/Charles-XIII Charles XIII] at [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]&lt;/ref&gt;Bernadotte was elected partly because a large part of the [[Swedish Army]], in view of future complications with [[Russia]], were in favour of electing a soldier, and partly because he was also personally popular, owing to the kindness he had shown to the Swedish prisoners during the recent war with Denmark</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bain|1911|p=932}} The matter was decided by one of the Swedish courtiers, Baron [[Karl Otto Mörner]], who, entirely on his own initiative, offered the succession to the Swedish crown to Bernadotte</span>
				<span class='text'>Bernadotte communicated Mörner's offer to Napoleon, who treated the whole affair as an absurdity</span>
				<span class='text'>The Emperor did not support Bernadotte but did not oppose him either and so Bernadotte informed Mörner that he would not refuse the honour if he were elected</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the [[Privy Council of Sweden|Swedish government]], amazed at Mörner's effrontery, at once placed him under arrest on his return to Sweden, the candidature of Bernadotte gradually gained favour and on 21 August 1810{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=932}} he was elected by the [[Riksdag of the Estates]] to be the new [[Crown Prince]],{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=932}} and was subsequently made [[Generalissimus]] of the [[Swedish Armed Forces]] by the King</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bain|1911|p=932}} At the same time, he converted from [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] to the [[Lutheranism]] of the [[Royal Court of Sweden|Swedish court]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;The new Crown Prince was very soon the most popular and most powerful man in Sweden</span>
				<span class='text'>The infirmity of the old King and the dissensions in the [[Privy Council of Sweden]] placed the government, and especially the control of [[foreign policy]], entirely in his hands</span>
				<span class='text'>The keynote of his whole policy was the acquisition of Norway as a compensation for the loss of Finland and Bernadotte proved anything but a puppet of France</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bain|1911|p=932}} Many Swedes expected him to reconquer Finland which had been ceded to Russia, however, the crown prince made up his mind to make a united Scandinavia peninsula by taking Norway from Denmark and uniting her to Sweden</span>
				<span class='text'>He tried to divert public opinion from Finland to Norway, by arguing that to create a compact peninsula, with sea for its natural boundary, was to inaugurate an era of peace, and that to establish a state of war with Russia would lead to ruinous consequences</span>

				<span class='text'>P</span>
				<span class='text'>57-258&lt;/ref&gt;Soon after Charles John’s arrival in Sweden, Napoleon compelled him to accede to the continental system and declare war against Great Britain; otherwise, Sweden would have to face the determination of France, Denmark and Russia</span>
				<span class='text'>his demand would mean a hard blow to the national economy and produce negative consequences for the Sweden</span>
				<span class='text'>Sweden reluctantly declared war against Great Britain but it was treated by both countries as being merely nominal</span>
