				<span class='text'>He achieved wide renown in his day and, while primarily influential within the [[Continental philosophy|continental]] tradition of philosophy, has become increasingly influential in the [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] tradition as well</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Although he remains a divisive figure, his canonical stature within [[Western philosophy]] is universally recognized</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Any introductory text to the history of philosophy written in the past century</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Hegel's principal achievement is his development of a distinctive articulation of [[idealism]] sometimes termed &quot;[[absolute idealism]],&quot;&lt;ref&gt;This term is actually quite rare in Hegel's writings</span>
				<span class='text'>It does not occur anywhere in ''The Science of Logic'' (though he comes close in a remark at p</span>
				<span class='text'>24 of the [2010] di Giovanni translation, GW 21</span>
				<span class='text'>42)</span>
				<span class='text'>In the ''Encyclopedia'' presentation of his logic it can be found only at §45R</span>
				<span class='text'>Greraets, Suchting and Harris note in the introduction to their translation of this later text that the term is more strongly associated with English movement in that later part of the 19th century (Hackett: 1991, xiii)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; in which the dualisms of, for instance, mind and nature and [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]] and [[Object (philosophy)|object]] are overcome</span>
				<span class='text'>His philosophy of spirit conceptually integrates psychology, the state, history, art, religion, and philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>His account of the [[master–slave dialectic]] has been highly influential, especially in 20th-century France</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Overwhelmingly due to Alexander Kojeve's influential lectures published as ''Introduction ala lecture de Hegel'' (Paris, 1947), selections translated into English by James Nichols as ''Introduction to the Reading of Hegel'' (New York, 1969)</span>
				<span class='text'>See, for instance, Aimé Patri, &quot;Dialecdque du Maître et de l'Bclave,&quot; Le Contrat Social,V, No</span>
				<span class='text'>a (July–August 196r), 234, cited in Editor's Introduction (vii) on the extent of their influence</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Of special importance is his concept of [[Geist|spirit]] (''Geist'': sometimes also translated as &quot;mind&quot;) as the historical manifestation of the logical concept and the [[Aufheben|&quot;sublation&quot;]] (''Aufhebung'': integration without [[Reduction (philosophy)|elimination or reduction]]) of seemingly contradictory or opposing factors; examples include the apparent opposition between nature and [[Freedom of will|freedom]] and between [[immanence]] and [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Hegel has been seen in the 21st century as the originator of the [[thesis, antithesis, synthesis]] triad; however this originated with [[Johann Fichte]]</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Breazeale|first1=Daniel|last2=Fichte|first2=Johann|title=Fichte: Early Philosophical Writings|date=1993|publisher=Cornell University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;Hegel has influenced many thinkers and writers whose own positions vary widely</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;&quot;One of the few things on which the analysts, pragmatists, and existentialists agree with the dialectical theologians is that Hegel is to be repudiated: their attitude toward Kant, Aristotle, Plato, and the other great philosophers is not at all unanimous even within each movement; but opposition to Hegel is part of the platform of all four, and of the Marxists, too</span>

				<span class='text'>Christened Georg Wilhelm Friedrich, he was known as Wilhelm to his close family</span>
				<span class='text'>His father, Georg Ludwig, was ''Rentkammersekretär'' (secretary to the revenue office) at the court of [[Karl Eugen, Duke of Württemberg]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|2–3, 745}} Hegel's mother, Maria Magdalena Louisa (née Fromm), was the daughter of a lawyer at the High Court of Justice at the Württemberg court</span>
				<span class='text'>She died of a &quot;bilious fever&quot; (''Gallenfieber'') when Hegel was thirteen</span>
				<span class='text'>Hegel and his father also caught the disease but narrowly survived</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pinkard, ''Hegel: A Biography'', p</span>

				<span class='text'>the index to Pinkard's book and his &quot;Chronology of Hegel's Life,&quot; which correctly give the date as 1783 (pp</span>
				<span class='text'>773, 745); see also [[:de:Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel#Studien und Interessen|German Wikipedia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Hegel had a sister, Christiane Luise (1773–1832), and a brother, Georg Ludwig (1776–1812), who was to perish as an officer in Napoleon's Russian campaign of 1812</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|4}}At the age of three Hegel went to the &quot;German School</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; When he entered the &quot;Latin School&quot; two years later, he already knew the [[first declension]], having been taught it by his mother</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1776, Hegel entered Stuttgart's ''[[Gymnasium Illustre]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>During his adolescence Hegel read voraciously, copying lengthy extracts in his diary</span>
				<span class='text'>Authors he read include the poet [[Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock|Klopstock]] and writers associated with the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], such as [[Christian Garve]] and [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Hegel's studies at the ''Gymnasium'' were concluded with his ''Abiturrede'' (&quot;graduation speech&quot;) entitled &quot;The abortive state of art and scholarship in Turkey</span>

				<span class='text'>df&lt;/ref&gt;====Tübingen (1788–93)====At the age of eighteen Hegel entered the [[Tübinger Stift]] (a Protestant seminary attached to the [[University of Tübingen]]), where two fellow students were to become vital to his development - poet [[Friedrich Hölderlin]], and philosopher-to-be [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Sharing a dislike for what they regarded as the restrictive environment of the Seminary, the three became close friends and mutually influenced each other's ideas</span>
				<span class='text'>All greatly admired Hellenic civilization, and Hegel additionally steeped himself in [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] and [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]] during this time</span>

				<span class='text'>title=Phenomenology and System|date=1995|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; They watched the unfolding of the [[French Revolution]] with shared enthusiasm</span>
				<span class='text'>Schelling and Hölderlin immersed themselves in theoretical debates on Kantian philosophy, from which Hegel remained aloof</span>
				<span class='text'>Hegel at this time envisaged his future as that of a ''Popularphilosoph'', i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> a &quot;man of letters&quot; who serves to make the abstruse ideas of philosophers accessible to a wider public; his own felt need to engage critically with the central ideas of Kantianism did not come until 1800</span>
				<span class='text'>===Bern (1793–96) and Frankfurt (1797–1801)====Having received his theological certificate (''[[consistory (Protestantism)|Konsistorial]]examen'') from the Tübingen Seminary, Hegel became ''Hofmeister'' (house tutor) to an aristocratic family in [[Bern]] (1793–96)</span>
				<span class='text'>During this period he composed the text which has become known as the &quot;[[Life of Jesus (Hegel)|Life of Jesus]]&quot; and a book-length manuscript titled &quot;The Positivity of the Christian Religion</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; His relations with his employers becoming strained, Hegel accepted an offer mediated by Hölderlin to take up a similar position with a wine merchant's family in [[Frankfurt]], where he moved in 1797</span>
				<span class='text'>Here Hölderlin exerted an important influence on Hegel's thought</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|80}} While in Frankfurt Hegel composed the essay &quot;Fragments on Religion and Love</span>

				<span class='text'>lso in 1797, the unpublished and unsigned manuscript of &quot;[[The Oldest Systematic Program of German Idealism]]&quot; was written</span>
				<span class='text'>It was written in Hegel's hand but thought to have been authored by Hegel, Schelling, Hölderlin, or by all three</span>
				<span class='text'>==Career years=======Jena, Bamberg and Nuremberg (1801–1816)====In 1801, Hegel came to [[Jena]] with the encouragement of his old friend Schelling, who held the position of Extraordinary Professor at the [[University of Jena|University]] there</span>
				<span class='text'>Hegel secured a position at the University as a ''[[Privatdozent]]'' (unsalaried lecturer) after submitting a ''[[Habilitation]]sschrift'' (dissertation) on the orbits of the planets</span>
				<span class='text'>Later in the year Hegel's first book, ''[[The Difference Between Fichte's and Schelling's Systems of Philosophy]]'', was completed</span>
				<span class='text'>He lectured on &quot;Logic and Metaphysics&quot; and gave joint lectures with Schelling on an &quot;Introduction to the Idea and Limits of True Philosophy&quot; and held a &quot;Philosophical Disputorium</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; In 1802, Schelling and Hegel founded a journal, the ''Kritische Journal der Philosophie'' (&quot;Critical Journal of Philosophy&quot;), to which they each contributed pieces until the collaboration was ended when Schelling left for [[Würzburg]] in 1803</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1805, the University promoted Hegel to the position of Extraordinary Professor (unsalaried), after Hegel wrote a letter to the poet and minister of culture [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]] protesting at the promotion of his philosophical adversary [[Jakob Friedrich Fries]] ahead of him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=pinkard&gt;{{cite book|last=Pinkard|first=Terry|title=Hegel: A Biography|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-49679-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|223}} Hegel attempted to enlist the help of the poet and translator [[Johann Heinrich Voß]] to obtain a post at the newly renascent [[University of Heidelberg]], but failed; to his chagrin, Fries was later in the same year made Ordinary Professor (salaried) there</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|200px|Napoleon, the &quot;world soul on horseback&quot;, in Jena]]His finances drying up quickly, Hegel was now under great pressure to deliver his book, the long-promised introduction to his System</span>
				<span class='text'>Hegel was putting the finishing touches to this book, the ''Phenomenology of Spirit'', as Napoleon engaged Prussian troops on October 14, 1806, in the [[Battle of Jena]] on a plateau outside the city</span>
				<span class='text'>On the day before the battle, Napoleon entered the city of Jena</span>
				<span class='text'>Hegel recounted his impressions in a letter to his friend [[Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;I saw the Emperor – this world-soul – riding out of the city on reconnaissance</span>
				<span class='text'>It is indeed a wonderful sensation to see such an individual, who, concentrated here at a single point, astride a horse, reaches out over the world and masters it&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>this extraordinary man, whom it is impossible not to admire</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|228}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;Although Napoleon chose not to close down Jena as he had other universities, the city was devastated and students deserted the university in droves, making Hegel's financial prospects even worse</span>
				<span class='text'>The following February Hegel's landlady Christiana Burkhardt (who had been abandoned by her husband) gave birth to their son Georg Ludwig Friedrich Fischer (1807–31)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|192}}In March 1807, aged 37, Hegel moved to [[Bamberg]], where Niethammer had declined and passed on to Hegel an offer to become editor of a newspaper, the ''Bamberger Zeitung''</span>
				<span class='text'>Hegel, unable to find more suitable employment, reluctantly accepted</span>
				<span class='text'>Ludwig Fischer and his mother (whom Hegel may have offered to marry following the death of her husband) stayed behind in Jena</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|238}}He was then, in November 1808, again through Niethammer, appointed headmaster of a ''Gymnasium'' in [[Nuremberg]], a post he held until 1816</span>
				<span class='text'>While in Nuremberg Hegel adapted his recently published ''Phenomenology of Spirit'' for use in the classroom</span>
				<span class='text'>Part of his remit being to teach a class called &quot;Introduction to Knowledge of the Universal Coherence of the Sciences,&quot; Hegel developed the idea of an encyclopedia of the philosophical sciences, falling into three parts (logic, philosophy of nature, and philosophy of spirit)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|337}}Hegel married Marie Helena Susanna von Tucher (1791–1855), the eldest daughter of a Senator, in 1811</span>
				<span class='text'>This period saw the publication of his second major work, the ''Science of Logic'' (''Wissenschaft der Logik''; 3 vols</span>
				<span class='text'> 1812, 1813, 1816), and the birth of his two legitimate sons, [[Karl von Hegel|Karl Friedrich Wilhelm (1813–1901)]] and Immanuel Thomas Christian (1814–1891)</span>
				<span class='text'>=== Heidelberg and Berlin (1816–1831) ====Having received offers of a post from the Universities of [[University of Erlangen|Erlangen]], [[University of Berlin|Berlin]], and [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]], Hegel chose Heidelberg, where he moved in 1816</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon after, in April 1817, his illegitimate son Ludwig Fischer (now ten years old) joined the Hegel household, having thus far spent his childhood in an orphanage</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|354–55}} (Ludwig's mother had died in the meantime</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|356}}Hegel published ''The Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences in Outline'' (1817) as a summary of his philosophy for students attending his lectures at Heidelberg</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Friedrich Hegel mit Studenten Lithographie F Kugler</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|Hegel with his Berlin students&lt;br&gt;Sketch by Franz Kugler]]In 1818, Hegel accepted the renewed offer of the chair of philosophy at the [[University of Berlin]], which had remained vacant since [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]]'s death in 1814</span>
				<span class='text'>Here he published his ''Philosophy of Right'' (1821)</span>
				<span class='text'>Hegel devoted himself primarily to delivering his lectures; his lecture courses on aesthetics, the philosophy of religion, the philosophy of history, and the history of philosophy were published posthumously from lecture notes taken by his students</span>
				<span class='text'>His fame spread and his lectures attracted students from all over Germany and beyond</span>
				<span class='text'>egel was appointed Rector of the University in 1830, when he was 60</span>
				<span class='text'>He was deeply disturbed by the riots for reform in Berlin in that year</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1831, [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William III]] decorated him for his service to the Prussian state</span>
				<span class='text'>In August 1831 a [[cholera]] epidemic reached Berlin and Hegel left the city, taking up lodgings in [[Kreuzberg]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Now in a weak state of health, Hegel seldom went out</span>
				<span class='text'>As the new semester began in October, Hegel returned to Berlin, with the (mistaken) impression that the epidemic had largely subsided</span>
				<span class='text'>By November 14 Hegel was dead</span>
				<span class='text'>The physicians pronounced the cause of death as cholera, but it is likely he died from a different gastrointestinal disease</span>
				<span class='text'>He is said to have uttered the last words &quot;And he didn't understand me&quot; before expiring</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Norman Davies, ''Europe: A history'' p</span>
				<span class='text'>687&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with his wishes, Hegel was buried on November 16 in the [[Dorotheenstadt cemetery]] next to Fichte and [[Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand Solger|Solger]]</span>
				<span class='text'>egel's son Ludwig Fischer had died shortly before while serving with the Dutch army in [[Jakarta|Batavia]]; the news of his death never reached his father</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|548}} Early the following year Hegel's sister Christiane committed suicide by drowning</span>
				<span class='text'>Hegel's remaining two sons - [[Karl von Hegel|Karl]], who became a historian, and Immanuel, who followed a theological path - lived long and safeguarded their father's ''[[Nachlaß]]'' and produced editions of his works</span>
				<span class='text'>= Thought ===== Freedom ===Hegel's thinking can be understood as a constructive development within the broad tradition that includes [[Plato]] and [[Immanuel Kant]]</span>
				<span class='text'>To this list one could add [[Proclus]], [[Meister Eckhart]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], [[Plotinus]], [[Jakob Böhme]], and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]</span>
				<span class='text'>What all these thinkers share, which distinguishes them from [[materialists]] like [[Epicurus]], the [[Stoicism|Stoics]], and [[Thomas Hobbes]], and from [[empiricists]] like [[David Hume]], is that they regard freedom or self-determination both as real and as having important [[ontology|ontological]] implications, for soul or mind or divinity</span>
				<span class='text'>This focus on freedom is what generates Plato's notion (in the ''[[Phaedo]]'', ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', and ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'') of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] as having a higher or fuller kind of reality than inanimate objects possess</span>
				<span class='text'>While Aristotle criticizes Plato's &quot;Forms,&quot; he preserves Plato's cornerstones of the ontological implications for self-determination: ethical reasoning, the soul's pinnacle in the hierarchy of nature, the order of the cosmos, and an assumption with reasoned arguments for a prime mover</span>
				<span class='text'>Kant imports Plato's high esteem of individual sovereignty to his considerations of moral and noumenal freedom, as well as to God</span>
				<span class='text'>All three find common ground on the unique position of humans in the scheme of things, known by the discussed categorical differences from animals and inanimate objects</span>
				<span class='text'>n his discussion of &quot;Spirit&quot; in his ''Encyclopedia'', Hegel praises Aristotle's ''[[On the Soul]]'' as &quot;by far the most admirable, perhaps even the sole, work of philosophical value on this topic</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;par</span>
				<span class='text'>378&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit|Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' and his ''[[Science of Logic]]'', Hegel's concern with Kantian topics such as freedom and morality, and with their ontological implications, is pervasive</span>
				<span class='text'>Rather than simply rejecting Kant's dualism of freedom versus nature, Hegel aims to subsume it within &quot;true infinity&quot;, the &quot;Concept&quot; (or &quot;Notion&quot;: ''Begriff''), &quot;Spirit&quot;, and &quot;ethical life&quot; in such a way that the Kantian duality is rendered intelligible, rather than remaining a brute &quot;given</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;The reason why this subsumption takes place in a ''series'' of concepts is that Hegel's method, in his ''Science of Logic'' and his ''Encyclopedia'', is to begin with basic concepts like Being and Nothing, and to develop these through a long sequence of elaborations, including those already mentioned</span>
				<span class='text'>In this manner, a solution that is reached, in principle, in the account of &quot;true infinity&quot; in the ''Science of Logic'''s chapter on &quot;Quality,&quot; is repeated in new guises at later stages, all the way to &quot;Spirit&quot; and &quot;ethical life,&quot; in the third volume of the ''Encyclopedia''</span>
				<span class='text'>n this way, Hegel intends to defend the germ of truth in Kantian dualism against reductive or eliminative programs like those of materialism and empiricism</span>
				<span class='text'>Like Plato, with his dualism of soul versus bodily appetites, Kant pursues the mind's ability to question its felt inclinations or appetites and to come up with a standard of &quot;duty&quot; (or, in Plato's case, &quot;good&quot;) which transcends bodily restrictiveness</span>
				<span class='text'>Hegel preserves this essential Platonic and Kantian concern in the form of infinity going beyond the finite (a process that Hegel in fact relates to &quot;freedom&quot; and the &quot;ought&quot;&lt;ref name=miller&gt;See ''Science of Logic'', trans</span>
				<span class='text'>Miller [Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities, 1989]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|133–136, 138}}), the universal going beyond the particular (in the Concept), and Spirit going beyond Nature</span>
				<span class='text'>And Hegel renders these dualities ''intelligible'' by (ultimately) his argument in the &quot;Quality&quot; chapter of the &quot;Science of Logic</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The finite has to become infinite in order to achieve reality</span>
				<span class='text'>The idea of the absolute excludes multiplicity so the subjective and objective must achieve synthesis to become whole</span>
				<span class='text'>This is because, as Hegel suggests by his introduction of the concept of &quot;reality,&quot;&lt;ref name=miller/&gt;{{rp|111}} what determines itself—rather than depending on its relations to other things for its essential character—is more fully &quot;real&quot; (following the Latin etymology of &quot;real:&quot; more &quot;thing-like&quot;) than what does not</span>
				<span class='text'>Finite things don't determine themselves, because, as &quot;finite&quot; things, their essential character is determined by their boundaries, over against other finite things</span>
				<span class='text'>So, in order to become &quot;real,&quot; they must go beyond their finitude (&quot;finitude ''is'' only as a transcending of itself&quot;&lt;ref name=miller/&gt;{{rp|145}}The result of this argument is that finite and infinite—and, by extension, particular and universal, nature and freedom—don't face one another as two independent realities, but instead the latter (in each case) is the ''self-transcending'' of the former</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=miller/&gt;{{rp|146}} Rather than stress the distinct singularity of each factor that complements and conflicts with others—without explanation—the relationship between finite and infinite (and particular and universal, and nature and freedom) becomes intelligible as a progressively developing and self-perfecting whole</span>
				<span class='text'>== Progress ===The obscure writings of Böhme had a strong effect on Hegel</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|reason=Any bibliographic evidence of direct influence? If so, is it not negligible in comparison to so many others? If Böhme's writing was so decisive as to merit such attention in this small amount of space, that seems to me as if it constitutes the apparently verboten &quot;original research</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;|date=December 2014}} Böhme had written that the [[Fall of Man]] was a necessary stage in the [[evolution]] of the [[universe]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This evolution was, itself, the result of God's desire for complete self-awareness</span>
				<span class='text'>Hegel was fascinated by the works of Kant, Rousseau, and [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]], and by the [[French Revolution]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Modern philosophy, culture, and society seemed to Hegel fraught with contradictions and tensions, such as those between the subject and object of knowledge, mind and nature, [[Self (Philosophy)|self]] and [[Other]], freedom and authority, knowledge and faith, the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and [[Romanticism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Hegel's main philosophical project was to take these contradictions and tensions and interpret them as part of a comprehensive, evolving, rational unity that, in different contexts, he called &quot;the absolute idea&quot; or '''absolute knowledge'''</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to Hegel, the main characteristic of this unity was that it evolved through and manifested itself in [[contradiction]] and negation</span>
				<span class='text'>Contradiction and negation have a dynamic quality that at every point in each domain of [[reality]]—[[consciousness]], history, philosophy, art, nature, society—leads to further development until a [[rationality|rational]] unity is reached that preserves the contradictions as phases and sub-parts by lifting them up ([[Aufheben|Aufhebung]]) to a higher unity</span>
				<span class='text'>This whole is mental because it is mind that can comprehend all of these phases and sub-parts as steps in its own process of comprehension</span>
				<span class='text'>It is rational because the same, underlying, [[logic]]al, developmental order underlies every domain of reality and is ultimately the order of self-conscious rational thought, although only in the later stages of development does it come to full self-consciousness</span>
				<span class='text'>The rational, self-conscious [[wikt:whole|whole]] is not a thing or [[being]] that lies outside of other existing things or minds</span>
				<span class='text'>Rather, it comes to completion only in the philosophical comprehension of individual existing human minds who, through their own understanding, bring this developmental process to an understanding of itself</span>
				<span class='text'>Hegel's thought is revolutionary to the extent that it is a philosophy of absolute negation: as long as absolute negation is at the center, systematization remains open, and makes it possible for human beings to become subjects</span>

				<span class='text'>quot; Some{{Who|date=December 2012}} have argued that either of these terms overly &quot;psychologize&quot; Hegel,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} implying a kind of disembodied, solipsistic consciousness like [[ghost]] or &quot;soul</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Geist combines the meaning of spirit—as in god, ghost or mind—with an intentional force</span>
				<span class='text'>In Hegel's early philosophy of nature (draft manuscripts written during his time at the University of Jena), Hegel's notion of &quot;Geist&quot; was tightly bound to the notion of &quot;[[Aether (classical element)|Aether]]&quot; from which Hegel also derived the concepts of [[space]] and [[time]]; however in his later works (after Jena) Hegel did not explicitly use his old notion of &quot;Aether&quot; any more</span>

				<span class='text'> 2010, ISBN 978-3-639-28451-5&lt;/ref&gt;Central to Hegel's [[Conception (idea)|conception]] of [[knowledge]] and mind (and therefore also of reality) was the notion of [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]] in [[Subtraction|difference]], that is that mind [[externalization|externalizes]] itself in various forms and [[object (philosophy)|object]]s that stand outside of it or opposed to it, and that, through recognizing itself in them, is &quot;with itself&quot; in these external manifestations, so that they are at one and the same time mind and other-than-mind</span>
				<span class='text'>This notion of identity in difference, which is intimately bound up with his conception of contradiction and negativity, is a principal feature differentiating Hegel's thought from that of other philosophers</span>

				<span class='text'>This liberal distinction between [[political society]] and [[civil society]] was followed by [[Alexis de Tocqueville]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;glob&quot; /&gt; In fact, Hegel's distinctions as to what he meant by civil society are often unclear</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, while it seems to be the case that he felt that a civil-society such as the German society in which he lived was an inevitable movement of the dialectic, he made way for the crushing of other types of &quot;lesser&quot; and not fully realized types of civil society, as these societies were not fully conscious or aware, as it were, as to the lack of progress in their societies</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, it was perfectly legitimate in the eyes of Hegel for a conqueror, such as Napoleon, to come along and destroy that which was not fully realized</span>
				<span class='text'>==Heraclitus===According to Hegel, &quot;[[Heraclitus]] is the one who first declared the nature of the infinite and first grasped nature as in itself infinite, that is, its essence as process</span>

				<span class='text'>According to Hegel, Heraclitus's &quot;obscurity&quot; comes from his being a true (in Hegel's terms &quot;speculative&quot;) philosopher who grasped the ultimate philosophical truth and therefore expressed himself in a way that goes beyond the abstract and limited nature of common sense and is difficult to grasp by those who operate within common sense</span>
				<span class='text'>Hegel asserted that in Heraclitus he had an antecedent for his logic: &quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/blockquote&gt;Heraclitus does not form any abstract nouns from his ordinary use of &quot;to be&quot; and &quot;to become&quot; and in that fragment seems to be opposing any identity A to any other identity B, C, etc</span>
				<span class='text'> which is not-A</span>
				<span class='text'>Hegel, however, interprets not-A as not existing at all, not nothing at all, which cannot be conceived, but indeterminate or &quot;pure&quot; [[being]] without particularity or specificity</span>

				<span class='text'>This interpretation of Heraclitus cannot be ruled out, but even if present is not the main gist of his thought</span>
				<span class='text'>or Hegel, the inner movement of reality is the process of God thinking, as manifested in the evolution of the universe of nature and thought; that is, Hegel argued that, when fully and properly understood, [[reality]] is being [[Idealism|thought]] by God as manifested in a person's comprehension of this process in and through philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>Since human thought is the image and fulfillment of God's thought, God is not [[Ineffability|ineffable]] (so incomprehensible as to be unutterable) but can be understood by an analysis of thought and reality</span>
				<span class='text'>Just as humans continually correct their concepts of reality through a [[dialectic|dialectical process]], so God himself becomes more fully manifested through the dialectical process of becoming</span>
				<span class='text'>or his god Hegel does not take the logos of Heraclitus but refers rather to the [[nous]] of [[Anaxagoras]], although he may well have regarded them the same, as he continues to refer to god's plan, which is identical to God</span>
				<span class='text'>Whatever the nous thinks at any time is actual [[Substance theory|substance]] and is identical to limited being, but more remains to be thought in the substrate of non-being, which is identical to pure or unlimited thought</span>
				<span class='text'>he universe as becoming is therefore a combination of being and non-being</span>
				<span class='text'>The particular is never complete in itself but to find completion is continually transformed into more comprehensive, complex, self-relating particulars</span>
				<span class='text'>The essential nature of being-for-itself is that it is free &quot;in itself;&quot; that is, it does not depend on anything else, such as matter, for its being</span>
				<span class='text'>The limitations represent fetters, which it must constantly be casting off as it becomes freer and more self-determining</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;The notable Introduction to ''Philosophy of History'' expresses the historical aspects of the dialectic</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Although Hegel began his philosophizing with commentary on the Christian religion and often expresses the view that he is a Christian, his ideas of God are not acceptable to some Christians, although he has had a major influence on 19th- and 20th-century theology</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time, an atheistic version of his thought was adopted instead by some [[Marxism|Marxists]], who, stripping away the concepts of divinity, styled what was left [[dialectical materialism]], which some saw as originating in Heraclitus</span>

				<span class='text'>2&lt;/ref&gt;One especially difficult aspect of Hegel's work is his innovation in logic</span>
				<span class='text'>In response to Immanuel Kant's challenge to the limits of [[Critique of Pure Reason|pure reason]], Hegel develops a radically new form of logic, which he called ''speculative</span>
				<span class='text'>' The difficulty in reading Hegel was perceived in Hegel's own day, and persists into the 21st century</span>
				<span class='text'>To understand Hegel fully requires paying attention to his critique of standard logic, such as the [[law of contradiction]] and the [[law of the excluded middle]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Many philosophers who came after Hegel and were influenced by him, whether adopting or rejecting his ideas, did so without fully absorbing his new speculative or dialectical logic</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}According to Walter Kaufmann, the basic idea of Hegel's works, especially the ''Phenomenology of the Spirit'' is that a philosopher should not &quot;confine him or herself to views that have been held but penetrate these to the human reality they reflect</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; In other words, it is not enough to consider propositions, or even the content of consciousness; &quot;it is worthwhile to ask in every instance what kind of spirit would entertain such propositions, hold such views, and have such a consciousness</span>
				<span class='text'>Every outlook in other words, is to be studied not merely as an academic possibility but as an existential reality</span>

				<span class='text'>115&lt;/ref&gt;=== Left and Right Hegelianism ===Some historians have spoken of Hegel's influence as represented by two opposing camps</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Right Hegelians]], the allegedly direct disciples of Hegel at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität]], advocated a [[Protestant]] orthodoxy and the political conservatism of the post-[[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] Restoration period</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Young Hegelians|Left Hegelians]], also known as the Young Hegelians, interpreted Hegel in a revolutionary sense, leading to an advocation of [[atheism]] in religion and [[liberal democracy]] in politics</span>
				<span class='text'>n more recent studies, however, this paradigm has been questioned</span>

				<span class='text'>Green, New York: Columbia University Press, 1964</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; No Hegelians of the period ever referred to themselves as &quot;Right Hegelians;&quot; that was a term of insult originated by [[David Strauss]], a self-styled Left Hegelian</span>
				<span class='text'>Critiques of Hegel offered from the Left Hegelians radically diverted Hegel's thinking into new directions and eventually came to form a disproportionately large part of the literature on and about Hegel</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}The Left Hegelians also spawned [[Marxism]], which inspired global movements, encompassing the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], the [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|Chinese Revolution]], and myriad revolutionary practices up until the present moment</span>
				<span class='text'>wentieth-century interpretations of Hegel were mostly shaped by [[British idealism|British Idealism]], [[logical positivism]], [[Marxism]], and [[Fascism]]</span>

				<span class='text'> 1965&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the fall of the [[USSR]], a new wave of Hegel scholarship arose in the West, without the preconceptions of the prior schools of thought</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Walter Jaeschke]] and [[Otto Pöggeler]] in Germany, as well as Peter Hodgson and [[Howard Kainz]] in America are notable for their recent contributions to post-USSR thinking about Hegel</span>
				<span class='text'>== Triads ==={{main|Thesis, antithesis, synthesis}}In previous modern accounts of Hegelianism (to undergraduate classes, for example), especially those formed prior to the Hegel renaissance, Hegel's [[dialectic]] was most often characterized as a three-step process, &quot;[[thesis, antithesis, synthesis]];&quot; namely, that a &quot;thesis&quot; (e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>the [[French Revolution]]) would cause the creation of its &quot;antithesis&quot; (e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>the [[Reign of Terror]] that followed), and would eventually result in a &quot;synthesis&quot; (e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>the [[constitutional state]] of free citizens)</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Hegel used this classification only once, and he attributed the terminology to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The terminology was largely developed earlier by [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It was spread by [[Heinrich Moritz Chalybäus]] in accounts of Hegelian philosophy, and since then the terms have been used as descriptive of this type of framework</span>
				<span class='text'>he &quot;thesis-antithesis-synthesis&quot; approach gives the sense that things or ideas are contradicted or opposed by things that come from outside them</span>
				<span class='text'>To the contrary, the fundamental notion of Hegel's dialectic is that things or ideas have internal contradictions</span>
				<span class='text'>From Hegel's point of view, analysis or comprehension of a thing or idea reveals that underneath its apparently simple identity or unity is an underlying inner contradiction</span>
				<span class='text'>This contradiction leads to the dissolution of the thing or idea in the simple form in which it presented itself and to a higher-level, more complex thing or idea that more adequately incorporates the contradiction</span>
				<span class='text'>The triadic form that appears in many places in Hegel (e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>being-nothingness-becoming, immediate-mediate-concrete, abstract-negative-concrete) is about this movement from inner contradiction to higher-level integration or unification</span>
				<span class='text'>or Hegel, reason is but &quot;speculative,&quot; not &quot;dialectical</span>

				<span class='text'>238]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Believing that the traditional description of Hegel's philosophy in terms of thesis-antithesis-synthesis was mistaken, a few scholars, like [[Raya Dunayevskaya]], have attempted to discard the triadic approach altogether</span>
				<span class='text'>According to their argument, although Hegel refers to ''&quot;the two elemental considerations: first, the idea of freedom as the absolute and final aim; secondly, the means for realising it, i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>the subjective side of knowledge and will, with its life, movement, and activity&quot;'' (thesis and antithesis) he doesn't use &quot;synthesis&quot; but instead speaks of the ''&quot;Whole&quot;'': ''&quot;We then recognised the State as the moral Whole and the Reality of Freedom, and consequently as the objective unity of these two elements</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;'' Furthermore, in Hegel's language, the &quot;dialectical&quot; aspect or &quot;moment&quot; of thought and reality, by which things or thoughts turn into their opposites or have their inner contradictions brought to the surface, what he called &quot;[[Aufheben|Aufhebung]],&quot; is only preliminary to the &quot;speculative&quot; (and not &quot;synthesizing&quot;) aspect or &quot;moment,&quot; which grasps the unity of these opposites or contradiction</span>
				<span class='text'>t is widely admitted today that the old-fashioned description of Hegel's philosophy in terms of &quot;thesis-antithesis-synthesis&quot; is inaccurate</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, such is the persistence of this misnomer that the model and terminology survive in a number of scholarly works</span>

				<span class='text'>This was due to (a) the rediscovery and reevaluation of Hegel as a possible philosophical progenitor of Marxism by philosophically oriented Marxists, (b) a resurgence of the historical perspective that Hegel brought to everything, and (c) an increasing recognition of the importance of his [[dialectical method]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Lukács' ''[[History and Class Consciousness]]'' (1923) helped to reintroduce Hegel into the Marxist canon</span>
				<span class='text'>This sparked a renewed interest in Hegel reflected in the work of [[Herbert Marcuse]], Adorno, [[Ernst Bloch]], Dunayevskaya, [[Alexandre Kojève]] and [[Gotthard Günther]] among others</span>
				<span class='text'>Marcuse, in ''[[Reason and Revolution]]'' (1941), made the case for Hegel as a revolutionary and criticized [[Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse]]'s thesis that Hegel was a totalitarian</span>

				<span class='text'> those written before the ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The direct and indirect influence of Kojève's lectures and writings (on the ''Phenomenology of Spirit'', in particular) mean that it is not possible to understand most French philosophers from [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] to [[Jacques Derrida]] without understanding Hegel</span>

				<span class='text'>eginning in the 1960s, Anglo-American Hegel scholarship has attempted to challenge the traditional interpretation of Hegel as offering a metaphysical system: this has also been the approach of [[Z</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Pelczynski]] and [[Shlomo Avineri]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This view, sometimes referred to as the 'non-metaphysical option', has had a decided influence on many major English language studies of Hegel in the past 40 years</span>
				<span class='text'>ate 20th-century literature in Western [[Theology]] that is friendly to Hegel includes works by such writers as [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] (1966), [[Dale M</span>
				<span class='text'>Schlitt]] (1984), [[Theodore Geraets]] (1985), [[Philip M</span>
				<span class='text'>Merklinger]] (1991), [[Stephen Rocker]] (1995), and [[Cyril O'Regan]] (1995)</span>
				<span class='text'>ecently, two prominent American philosophers, [[John McDowell]] and [[Robert Brandom]] (sometimes referred to as the [[University of Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh]] Hegelians), have produced philosophical works exhibiting a marked Hegelian influence</span>
				<span class='text'>Each is avowedly influenced by the late [[Wilfred Sellars]], also of Pittsburgh, who referred to his seminal work, ''Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind'' (1956) as a series of &quot;incipient ''Méditations Hegeliennes''&quot; (in homage to [[Edmund Husserl]]'s 1931 treatise, ''[[Cartesian Meditations|Meditations Cartesiennes]]'')</span>
				<span class='text'>eginning in the 1990s, after the fall of the [[USSR]], a fresh reading of Hegel took place in the West</span>
				<span class='text'>For these scholars, fairly well represented by the Hegel Society of America and in cooperation with German scholars such as Otto Pöggeler and Walter Jaeschke, Hegel's works should be read without preconceptions</span>
				<span class='text'>Marx plays little-to-no role in these new readings</span>
				<span class='text'>Some American philosophers associated with this movement include [[Lawrence Stepelevich]], [[Rudolf Siebert]], Richard Dien Winfield, and [[Theodore Geraets]]</span>
				<span class='text'>== Criticism ===Criticism of Hegel has been widespread in the 19th and the 20th centuries; a diverse range of individuals including [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], Marx, Kierkegaard, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[G</span>
				<span class='text'>E</span>
				<span class='text'>Moore]], [[Eric Voegelin]] and [[A</span>
				<span class='text'>J</span>
				<span class='text'>Ayer]] have challenged Hegelian philosophy from a variety of perspectives</span>
				<span class='text'>Among the first to take a critical view of Hegel's system was the 19th Century German group known as the [[Young Hegelians]], which included Feuerbach, Marx, Engels, and their followers</span>
				<span class='text'>In Britain, the Hegelian [[British idealism|British Idealism]] school (members of which included [[Francis Herbert Bradley]], [[Bernard Bosanquet (philosopher)|Bernard Bosanquet]], and, in the United States, [[Josiah Royce]]) was challenged and rejected by [[analytic philosophy|analytic]] philosophers Moore and Russell; Russell, in particular, considered &quot;almost all&quot; of Hegel's doctrines to be false</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;B</span>
				<span class='text'>ussell, History of western philosophy, pg 701 chapter 22, paragraph 1</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Regarding Hegel's interpretation of history, Russell commented, &quot;Like other historical theories, it required, if it was to be made plausible, some distortion of facts and considerable ignorance</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Russell, 735</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  [[Logical positivism|Logical positivists]] such as Ayer and the [[Vienna Circle]] criticized both Hegelian philosophy and its supporters, such as Bradley</span>
				<span class='text'>egel's contemporary Schopenhauer was particularly critical, and wrote of Hegel's philosophy as &quot;a pseudo-philosophy paralyzing all mental powers, stifling all real thinking</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;On the Basis of Morality</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Kierkegaard criticized Hegel's 'absolute knowledge' unity</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard Concluding Unscientific Postscriptt&lt;/ref&gt; Scientist [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] also criticized the obscure complexity of Hegel's works, referring to Hegel's writing as an &quot;unclear thoughtless flow of words</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Boltzmann, ''Theoretical physics and philosophical problems: Selected writings'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>155, [[D</span>
				<span class='text'>Reidel]], 1974, ISBN 90-277-0250-0&lt;/ref&gt;  In a similar vein, Robert Pippin wrote that Hegel had &quot;the ugliest prose style in the history of the German language</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Robert B</span>
				<span class='text'>Pippin, ''Hegel's Idealism: The Satisfaction of Self-Consciousness (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989), 5&lt;/ref&gt; Russell stated in his ''Unpopular Essays'' (1950) and ''[[A History of Western Philosophy]]'' (1945) that Hegel was &quot;the hardest to understand of all the great philosophers</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; [[Karl Popper]] wrote that &quot;there is so much philosophical writing (especially in the Hegelian school) which may justly be criticized as meaningless verbiage</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper, ''Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge'' (New York: Routledge, 1963), 94</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Popper also makes the claim in the second volume of ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'' (1945) that Hegel's system formed a thinly veiled justification for the [[Absolute monarchy|absolute rule]] of [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William III]], and that Hegel's idea of the ultimate goal of history was to reach a [[sovereign state|state]] approximating that of 1830s [[Prussia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Popper further proposed that Hegel's philosophy served not only as an inspiration for [[communism|communist]] and [[fascism|fascist]] totalitarian governments of the 20th century, whose dialectics allow for any belief to be construed as rational simply if it could be said to exist</span>
				<span class='text'>Scholars such as Kaufmann and [[Shlomo Avineri]] have criticized Popper's theories about Hegel</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See for instance Walter Kaufmann 1959, [http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>rg/reference/subject/philosophy/works/us/kaufmann</span>
				<span class='text'>tm ''The Hegel Myth and Its Method'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isaiah Berlin]] listed Hegel as one of the six architects of modern [[authoritarianism]] who undermined [[liberal democracy]], along with Rousseau, [[Claude Adrien Helvétius]], Fichte, [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]], and [[Joseph de Maistre]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Berlin, Isaiah, ''Freedom and Betrayal: Six Enemies of Human Liberty'' (Princeton University Press, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;Walter Kaufmann has argued that as unlikely as it may sound, it is not the case that Hegel was unable to write clearly, but that Hegel felt that &quot;he must and should not write in the way in which he was gifted</span>

				<span class='text'>Kaufmann, 1966, ''Hegel: A Reinterpretation'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>99&lt;/ref&gt;Voegelin argued that Hegel should be understood not as a philosopher, but as a &quot;sorcerer&quot; -- ''i</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;&quot; I do not argue that merely that we ''can'' understand Hegel as a Hermetic thinker, just as we can understand him as a German or a Swabian or an idealist thinker</span>
