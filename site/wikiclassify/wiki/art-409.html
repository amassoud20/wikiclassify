				<span class='text'>The only work that all scholars agree is Nagarjuna's is the ''[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]]'' (Fundamental Verses on the Middle Way), which contains the essentials of his thought in twenty-seven chapters</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to one view, that of Christian Lindtner,&lt;ref&gt;Lindtner, C</span>
				<span class='text'>(1982)</span>
				<span class='text'>Nagarjuniana: studies in the writings and philosophy of Nāgārjuna, Copenhagen: Akademisk forlag, page 11&lt;/ref&gt; the works definitely written by Nagarjuna are:* ''Mūlamadhyamaka-kārikā'' (Fundamental Verses of the Middle Way)* ''Śūnyatāsaptati'' (Seventy Verses on Emptiness)* ''Vigrahavyāvartanī'' (The End of Disputes)* {{IAST|''Vaidalyaprakaraṇa''}} (Pulverizing the Categories)* ''Vyavahārasiddhi'' (Proof of Convention)* {{IAST|''Yuktiṣāṣṭika''}} (Sixty Verses on Reasoning)* {{IAST|''Catuḥstava''}} (Hymn to the Absolute Reality)* ''Ratnāvalī'' (Precious Garland)* {{IAST|''Pratītyasamutpādahṝdayakārika''}} (Constituents of Dependent Arising)* ''Sūtrasamuccaya''* {{IAST|''Bodhicittavivaraṇa''}} (Exposition of the Enlightened Mind)* {{IAST|''Suhṛllekha''}} (Letter to a Good Friend)* {{IAST|''Bodhisaṃbhāra''}} (Requisites of Enlightenment)In addition to works mentioned above, several others are attributed toNāgārjuna</span>
				<span class='text'>There is an ongoing, lively controversy over which of thoseworks are authentic</span>
				<span class='text'>Contemporary research suggest that these works belongto a significantly later period, either to late 8th or early 9th century CE,and hence can not be authentic works of Nāgārjuna</span>
				<span class='text'>owever, several works considered important in esoteric Buddhism areattributed to Nāgārjuna and his disciples by traditional historianslike Tāranātha from 17th century Tibet</span>
				<span class='text'>These historians try to accountfor chronological difficulties with various theories</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, apropagation of later writings via mystical revelation</span>
				<span class='text'>For a usefulsummary of this tradition, see Wedemeyer 2007</span>
				<span class='text'>indtner considers that the ''Māhaprajñāparamitopadeśa'' &quot;Commentary on the Great Perfection of Wisdom&quot; is not a genuine work of Nāgārjuna</span>
				<span class='text'>This work is only attested in a Chinese translation by [[Kumārajīva]]</span>
				<span class='text'>here is much discussion as to whether this is a work of Nāgārjuna, or someone else</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Étienne Lamotte]], who translated one third of the work into French, felt that it was the work of a North Indian [[bhikkhu|bhikṣu]] of the [[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivāda]] school who later became a convert to the [[Mahayana]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Chinese scholar-monk [[Yin Shun]] felt that it was the work of a South Indian and that Nāgārjuna was quite possibly the author</span>
				<span class='text'>These two views are not necessarily in opposition and a South Indian Nāgārjuna could well have studied the northern Sarvāstivāda</span>
				<span class='text'>Neither of the two felt that it was composed by Kumārajīva, which others have suggested</span>
				<span class='text'>=Philosophy==[[File:Nagarjuna</span>
				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|left|Statue of Nagarjuna in Tibetan monastery near [[Kullu]], India|200px]]From studying his writings, it is clear that Nāgārjuna was conversant with many of the [[Śrāvaka]] philosophies and with the Mahāyāna tradition</span>
				<span class='text'>However, determining Nāgārjuna's affiliation with a specific [[nikāya]] is difficult, considering much of this material has been lost</span>
				<span class='text'>If the most commonly accepted attribution of texts (that of Christian Lindtner) holds, then he was clearly a Māhayānist, but his philosophy holds assiduously to the Śrāvaka ''[[Tripiṭaka]]'', and while he does make explicit references to Mahāyāna texts, he is always careful to stay within the parameters set out by the Śrāvaka canon</span>
				<span class='text'>agarjuna may have arrived at his positions from a desire to achieve a consistent exegesis of the Buddha's doctrine as recorded in the [[āgama (Buddhism)|āgamas]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In the eyes of Nagarjuna, the Buddha was not merely a forerunner, but the very founder of the Madhyamaka system</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Christian Lindtner, ''Master of Wisdom</span>
				<span class='text'>' Dharma Publishing 1997, page 324</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; David Kalupahana sees Nagarjuna as a successor to [[Moggaliputta-Tissa]] in being a champion of the middle-way and a reviver of the original philosophical ideals of the Buddha</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;David Kalupahana, ''Mulamadhyamakakarika of Nagarjuna: The Philosophy of the Middle Way</span>
				<span class='text'>' Motilal Banarsidass, 2005, pages 2,5</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Sunyata===Nāgārjuna's major thematic focus is the concept of [[śūnyatā]], or &quot;emptiness,&quot; which brings together other key Buddhist doctrines, particularly [[anatta|anātman]] &quot;not-self&quot; and [[pratītyasamutpāda]] &quot;dependent origination&quot;, to refute the metaphysics of some of his contemporaries</span>
				<span class='text'>For Nāgārjuna, as for the Buddha in the early texts, it is not merely [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings]] that are &quot;selfless&quot; or non-substantial; all phenomena (dhammas) are without any [[svabhava|svabhāva]], literally &quot;own-being&quot;, &quot;self-nature&quot;, or &quot;inherent existence&quot; and thus without any underlying essence</span>
				<span class='text'>They are ''empty'' of being independently existent; thus the heterodox theories of svabhāva circulating at the time were refuted on the basis of the doctrines of early Buddhism</span>
				<span class='text'>This is so because all things arise always dependently: not by their own power, but by depending on conditions leading to their coming into [[existence]], as opposed to [[being]]</span>
				<span class='text'>hapter 24 verse 14 of the [[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]] provides one of Nagarjuna's most famous quotations on emptiness and co-arising:&lt;ref name=&quot;siderits&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Siderits | first1 = Mark | last2 = Katsura | first2 = Shoryu | title = Nagarjuna's Middle Way: Mulamadhyamakakarika (Classics of Indian Buddhism) | publisher = Wisdom Publications | year = 2013 | isbn = 1614290504 | pages=175–176}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|''sarva&amp;#7747; ca yujyate tasya &amp;#347;&amp;#363;nyat&amp;#257; yasya yujyate&lt;br /&gt;sarva&amp;#7747; na yujyate tasya &amp;#347;&amp;#363;nya&amp;#7747; yasya na yujyate''All is possible when emptiness is possible</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;br /&gt;Nothing is possible when emptiness is impossible</span>
				<span class='text'>}As part of his analysis of the emptiness of phenomena in the [[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]], Nagarjuna critiques svabhāva in several different concepts</span>
				<span class='text'>He discusses the problems of positing any sort of inherent essence to causation, movement, change and personal identity</span>
				<span class='text'>Nagarjuna makes use of the Indian logical tool of the [[tetralemma]] to attack any essentialist conceptions</span>
				<span class='text'>Nagarjuna’s logical analysis is based on four basic propositions::All things (dharma) exist: affirmation of being, negation of non-being:All things (dharma) do not exist: affirmation of non-being, negation of being:All things (dharma) both exist and do not exist: both affirmation and negation:All things (dharma) neither exist nor do not exist: neither affirmation nor negation &lt;ref&gt;Dumoulin, Heinrich (1998) Zen Buddhism: a history, India and China, Macmillan Publishing, 43&lt;/ref&gt;To say that all things are 'empty' is to deny any kind of ontological foundation, therefore Nagarjuna's view is often seen as a kind of ontological [[anti-foundationalism]]&lt;ref&gt;Westerhoff, Jan</span>

				<span class='text'>Nagarjuna as anti-realist, Journal of Indian Philosophy December 1988, Volume 16, Issue 4, pp 311-325</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Understanding the nature of the emptiness of phenomena is simply a means to an end, which is [[nirvana]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus Nagarjuna's philosophical project is ultimately a soteriological one meant to correct our everyday cognitive processes which mistakenly posits [[svabhava|svabhāva]] on the flow of experience</span>
				<span class='text'>ome scholars such as [[Fyodor Shcherbatskoy]] and T</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Murti held that Nagarjuna was the inventor of the Shunyata doctrine, however, more recent work by scholars such as Choong Mun-keat, Yin Shun and Dhammajothi Thero has argued that Nagarjuna was not an innovator by putting forth this theory,&lt;ref&gt;Yìn Shùn, An ­Investigation­ into ­Emptiness (Kōng zhī Tànjìu 空之探究) (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Choong, The­ Notion­ of ­Emptiness­ in­ Early Buddhism (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Medawachchiye Dhammajothi Thero, The Concept of Emptiness in Pali Literature&lt;/ref&gt; but that, in the words of Shi Huifeng, &quot;the connection between emptiness and dependent origination is not an innovation or creation of Nāgārjuna</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Shi huifeng: “Dependent Origination = Emptiness”—Nāgārjuna’s Innovation?&lt;/ref&gt;===Two truths===Nāgārjuna was also instrumental in the development of the [[two truths doctrine]], which claims that there are two levels of truth in Buddhist teaching, the ultimate truth (''paramārtha satya'') and the conventionally or superficial truth (''saṃvṛtisatya'')</span>
				<span class='text'>The ultimate truth to Nagarjuna is the truth that everything is empty of essence,&lt;ref&gt;Garfield, Jay</span>
				<span class='text'>Empty Words: Buddhist Philosophy and Cross-cultural Interpretation, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>91</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; this includes emptiness itself ('the emptiness of emptiness')</span>
				<span class='text'>While some (Murti, 1955) have interpreted this by positing Nagarjuna as a [[Neo-Kantianism|Neo-Kantian]] and thus making ultimate truth a metaphysical [[noumenon]] or an &quot;ineffable ultimate that transcends the capacities of discursive reason&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Siderits, Mark 2003&quot;&gt;Siderits, Mark, On the Soteriological Significance of Emptiness, Contemporary Buddhism, Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>4, No</span>
				<span class='text'>1, 2003</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; others such as Mark Siderits and Jay Garfield have argued that Nagarjuna's view is that &quot;the ultimate truth is that there is no ultimate truth&quot; (Siderits) and that Nagarjuna is a &quot;semantic anti-dualist&quot; who posits that there are only conventional truths</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Siderits, Mark 2003&quot;/&gt; Hence according to Garfield:&lt;blockquote&gt;Suppose that we take a conventional entity, such as a table</span>
				<span class='text'>We analyze it to demonstrate its emptiness, finding that there is no table apart from its parts […]</span>
				<span class='text'>So we conclude that it is empty</span>
				<span class='text'>But now let us analyze that emptiness […]</span>
				<span class='text'>What do we find? Nothing at all but the table’s lack of inherent existence</span>
				<span class='text'>[…]</span>
				<span class='text'>To see the table as empty […] is to see the table as conventional, as dependent</span>

				<span class='text'>title=Nāgārjuna: The Philosophy of the Middle Way|year=1986|publisher=State University of New York Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; which distinguishes definitive meaning (''nītārtha'') from interpretable meaning (''neyārtha''):{{quote|By and large, Kaccayana, this world is supported by a polarity, that of existence and non-existence</span>

				<span class='text'>Garfield describes that Nāgārjuna approached causality from the [[four noble truths]] and [[dependent origination]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Nāgārjuna distinguished two dependent origination views in a causal process, that which causes effects and that which causes conditions</span>
				<span class='text'>This is predicated in the [[Nagarjuna#Two_truths|two truth doctrine]], as conventional truth and ultimate truth held together, in which both are empty in existence</span>
				<span class='text'> The distinction between effects and conditions is controversial</span>
				<span class='text'>In Nāgārjuna's approach, cause means an event or state that has power to bring an effect</span>
				<span class='text'>Conditions, refer to proliferating causes that bring a further event, state or process; without a metaphysical commitment to an occult connection between explaining and explanans</span>
				<span class='text'>He argues nonexistent causes and various existing conditions</span>
				<span class='text'>The argument draws from unreal causal power</span>
				<span class='text'> Things conventional exist and are ultimately nonexistent to rest in the [[middle way]] in both causal existence and nonexistence as casual emptiness within the [[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]] doctrine</span>
				<span class='text'>Although seeming strange to Westerners, this is seen as an attack on a reified view of causality</span>

				<span class='text'>The degree to which he is taken seriously by so many eminent Indian, Chinese, Tibetan, Korean, Japanese, and Vietnamese philosophers, and lately by so many Western philosophers, alone justifies attention to his corpus</span>

				<span class='text'>Hayes writes:{{quote|Nagarjuna's writings had relatively little effect on the course of subsequent Indian Buddhist philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite his apparent attempts to discredit some of the most fundamental concepts of [[abhidharma]], abhidharma continued to ﬂourish for centuries, without any appreciable attempt on the part of abhidharmikas to defend their methods of analysis against Nagarjuna's criticisms</span>
				<span class='text'>And despite Nagarjuna's radical critique of the very possibility of having grounded knowledge (pramana), the epistemological school of [[Dignāga|Dignaga]] and [[Dharmakirti]] dominated Indian Buddhist intellectual circles, again without any explicit attempt to answer Nagarjuna's criticisms of their agenda</span>
				<span class='text'>Aside from a few commentators on Nagarjuna's works, who identiﬁed themselves as Madhyamikas, Indian Buddhist intellectual life continued almost as if Nagarjuna had never existed</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Iconography==Nāgārjuna is often depicted in composite form comprising human and nāga characteristics</span>
				<span class='text'>Often the nāga-aspect forms a canopy crowning and shielding his human head</span>
				<span class='text'>The notion of the naga is found throughout Indian religious culture, and typically signifies an intelligent serpent or dragon, who is responsible for the rains, lakes and other bodies of water</span>
				<span class='text'>In Buddhism, it is a synonym for a realised [[arhat]], or wise person in general</span>
