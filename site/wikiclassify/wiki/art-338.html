				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at the [[City of London School]] on a scholarship, after his first year, and in April 1941 was admitted to [[St</span>
				<span class='text'>John's College, Oxford]], also on a scholarship, where he read English</span>
				<span class='text'>It was there that he met [[Philip Larkin]], with whom he formed the most important friendship of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>While at Oxford, in June 1941, Amis joined the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]]</span>

				<span class='text'>08&lt;/ref&gt; After only a year, in July 1942, he was called up for national service</span>
				<span class='text'>After serving in the [[Royal Corps of Signals]] in the Second World War, Amis returned to Oxford in October 1945 to complete his degree</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he worked hard and earned in 1947 a first in English, he had by then decided to give much of his time to writing</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1946 he met [[Hilary Bardwell]]; they married in 1948 after she became pregnant with their first child, Philip</span>
				<span class='text'>Amis initially arranged for her to have a back-street [[abortion]], but changed his mind, fearing for her safety</span>
				<span class='text'>He became a lecturer in English at the [[University of Wales, Swansea]] (1949–1961)</span>

				<span class='text'>Days after Sally's birth, Amis's first novel ''[[Lucky Jim]]'' was published to great acclaim; critics saw it as having caught the flavour of Britain in the 1950s, ushering in a new style of fiction</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; By 1972, in addition to impressive sales in Britain, one and a quarter million paperback copies had been sold in the United States, and it was eventually translated into twenty languages, including Polish, [[Hebrew]], Korean, and Serbo-Croat</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, 1995, p</span>
				<span class='text'>62&lt;/ref&gt; The novel won the [[Somerset Maugham Award]] for fiction and Amis was associated with the writers labelled the [[Angry Young Men]]</span>
				<span class='text'>''Lucky Jim'' was one of the first British [[campus novel]]s, setting a precedent for later generations of writers such as [[Malcolm Bradbury]], [[David Lodge (author)|David Lodge]], [[Tom Sharpe]] and [[Howard Jacobson]]</span>
				<span class='text'>As a poet, Amis was associated with [[The Movement (literature)|The Movement]]</span>
				<span class='text'>uring 1958–1959 he made the first of two visits to the United States, where he was Visiting Fellow in Creative Writing at [[Princeton University]] and a visiting lecturer in other northeastern universities</span>
				<span class='text'>On returning to Britain, he fell into a rut, and he began looking for another post; after thirteen years at Swansea, Amis became a fellow of [[Peterhouse]], Cambridge (1961–1963)</span>
				<span class='text'>He regretted the move within a year, finding Cambridge an academic and social disappointment and resigned in 1963, intent on moving to Majorca; he went no farther than London</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Memoirs, &quot;Cambridge&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, Ch 10&lt;/ref&gt;In 1963, Hilary discovered Amis's love affair with novelist [[Elizabeth Jane Howard]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Hilary and Amis separated in August, and he went to live with Howard</span>
				<span class='text'>He divorced Hilary in 1965 and married Howard the same year</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1968 he moved with Howard to [[Lemmons]], a house in Barnet, north London</span>
				<span class='text'>She and Amis divorced in 1983</span>
				<span class='text'>n his last years, Amis shared a house with his first wife Hilary and her third husband, [[Alastair Boyd, 7th Baron Kilmarnock]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Martin wrote the memoir ''[[Experience (book)|Experience]]'' about the life, charm, and decline of his father</span>

				<span class='text'>In August 1995 he fell, suffering a suspected stroke</span>
				<span class='text'>After apparently recovering, he worsened, was re-admitted to hospital, and died on 22 October 1995 at [[St Pancras Hospital]], London</span>

				<span class='text'>=Literary work=={{Unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}Amis is chiefly known as a comedic novelist of mid- to late-20th-century British life, but his literary work extended into many genres — poetry, essays and criticism, short stories, food and drink writing, anthologies, and a number of novels in genres such as science fiction and mystery</span>
				<span class='text'>His career initially developed in a pattern which was the inverse of that followed by his close friend [[Philip Larkin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Before becoming known as a poet, Larkin had published two novels; Amis, on the other hand, originally wished to be a poet, and turned to writing novels only after publishing several volumes of verse</span>
				<span class='text'>He continued throughout his career to write poetry which is known for its typically straightforward and accessible style, yet which often masks a nuance of thought, for example, in &quot;Bookshop Idyll&quot; or &quot;Against Romanticism&quot;, just as it does in his novels</span>
				<span class='text'>mis's first novel, ''[[Lucky Jim]]'' (1954), is perhaps his most famous, satirizing the high-brow academic set of an unnamed university, seen through the eyes of its protagonist, Jim Dixon, as he tries to make his way as a young lecturer of history</span>
				<span class='text'>The novel was perceived by many as part of the [[Angry young men|Angry Young Men]] movement of the 1950s which reacted against the stultification of conventional British life, though Amis never encouraged this interpretation</span>
				<span class='text'>Amis’s other novels of the 1950s and early 1960s similarly depict situations from contemporary British life, often drawn from Amis’s own experiences</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[That Uncertain Feeling (novel)|That Uncertain Feeling]]'' (1955) centres on a young provincial librarian (again perhaps with reference to Larkin, librarian at Hull) and his temptation towards adultery; ''I Like It Here'' (1958) presents Amis’s contemptuous view of &quot;abroad&quot; and followed upon his own travels on the Continent with a young family; ''[[Take a Girl Like You]]'' (1960) steps away from the immediately autobiographical, but remains grounded in the concerns of sex and love in ordinary modern life, tracing the courtship and ultimate seduction of the heroine Jenny Bunn by a young schoolmaster, Patrick Standish</span>
				<span class='text'>ith ''The Anti-Death League'' (1966), Amis begins to show some of the experimentation – with content, if not with style – which would mark much of his work in the 1960s and 70s</span>
				<span class='text'>Amis’s departure from the strict realism of his early comedic novels is not so abrupt as might first appear</span>
				<span class='text'>He had avidly read science fiction since a boy, and had developed that interest into the Christian Gauss Lectures of 1958, while visiting [[Princeton University]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The lectures were published in that year as ''New Maps of Hell: A Survey of Science Fiction'', a serious but light-handed treatment of what the genre had to say about man and society</span>
				<span class='text'>Amis was particularly enthusiastic about the [[dystopian]] works of [[Frederik Pohl]] and [[C</span>
				<span class='text'>M</span>
				<span class='text'>Kornbluth]], and in ''New Maps of Hell'' coined the term &quot;comic inferno&quot; to describe a type of humorous dystopia, particularly as exemplified in the works of [[Robert Sheckley]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Amis further displayed his devotion to the genre in editing, with the [[Sovietologist]] [[Robert Conquest]], the science fiction anthology series ''Spectrum'' I–V, which drew heavily upon 1950s numbers of the magazine ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>hough not explicitly science fiction, ''The Anti-Death League'' takes liberties with reality not found in Amis’s earlier novels, and introduces a speculative bent into his fiction, one which would continue to develop in other of his genre novels, such as ''[[The Green Man (Kingsley Amis novel)|The Green Man]]'' (1969) (mystery/horror) and ''[[The Alteration]]'' (1976) ([[Alternate history|alternative history]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Much of this speculation was about the improbable existence of any benevolent deity involved in human affairs</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''The Anti-Death League'', ''The Green Man'', ''The Alteration'' and elsewhere, including poems such as &quot;The Huge Artifice: an interim assessment&quot; and &quot;New Approach Needed&quot;, Amis showed frustration with a God who could lace the world with such cruelty and injustice, and championed the preservation of ordinary human happiness – in family, in friendships, in physical pleasure – against the demands of any cosmological scheme</span>
				<span class='text'>The matter of Amis’s religious views is perhaps ultimately summed up in his response, reported in his ''Memoirs'', to the Russian poet [[Yevgeny Yevtushenko]]’s question, in his broken English: &quot;You atheist?&quot; Amis replied, &quot;It’s more that I hate Him</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;During this time, Amis had not turned completely away from the comedic realism of ''Lucky Jim'' and ''Take a Girl Like You''</span>
				<span class='text'>''I Want It Now'' (1968) and ''Girl, 20'' (1971) both depict the &quot;swinging&quot; atmosphere of London in the late '60s, in which Amis certainly participated, though neither book is strictly autobiographical</span>
				<span class='text'>''Girl, 20'', for instance, is framed in the world of classical (and pop) music, of which Amis was not a part — the book's relatively impressive command of musical terminology and opinion shows both Amis's amateur devotion to music and the almost journalistic capacity of his intelligence to take hold of a subject which interested him</span>
				<span class='text'>That intelligence is similarly on display in, for instance, the presentation of ecclesiastical matters in ''The Alteration'', when Amis was neither a Roman Catholic nor, for that matter, a devotee of any Church</span>
				<span class='text'>hroughout the 1950s, '60s, and '70s, Amis was regularly producing essays and criticism, principally for journalistic publication</span>
				<span class='text'>Some of these pieces were collected in 1968’s ''What Became of Jane Austen? and Other Essays'', in which Amis’s wit and literary and social opinions were on display ranging over books such as [[Colin Wilson]]’s ''The Outsider'' (panned), [[Iris Murdoch]]’s debut novel ''Under the Net'' (praised), or [[William Empson]]’s ''Milton’s God'' (inclined to agree with)</span>
				<span class='text'>Amis’s opinions on books and people tended to appear (and often, be) conservative, and yet, as the title essay of the collection shows, he was not merely reverent of &quot;the classics&quot; and of traditional morals, but was more disposed to exercise his own rather independent judgment in all things</span>
				<span class='text'>mis became associated with [[Ian Fleming]]'s [[James Bond]] novels, which he greatly admired, in the late 1960s, when he began composing critical works connected with the fictional spy, either under a pseudonym or uncredited</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1965, he wrote the popular ''[[The James Bond Dossier]]'' under his own name</span>
				<span class='text'>That same year, he wrote ''[[The Book of Bond]], or, Every Man His Own 007'', a tongue-in-cheek how-to manual about being a sophisticated spy, under the pseudonym &quot;Lt Col</span>
				<span class='text'>William ('Bill') Tanner&quot;, Tanner being M's Chief of Staff in many of Fleming's Bond novels</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1968 Amis wrote ''[[Colonel Sun]]'', which was published under the pseudonym &quot;[[Robert Markham]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>mis's literary style and tone changed significantly after 1970, with the possible exception of ''[[The Old Devils]]'', a [[Booker Prize]] winner</span>
				<span class='text'>Several critics accused him of being old fashioned and misogynistic</span>
				<span class='text'>His ''[[Stanley and the Women]]'', an exploration of social sanity, could be said to instance these traits</span>
				<span class='text'>Others said that his output lacked the humanity, wit, and compassion of earlier efforts</span>
				<span class='text'>This period also saw Amis the anthologist, a role in which his wide knowledge of all kinds of English poetry was on display</span>
				<span class='text'>''The New Oxford Book of Light Verse'' (1978), which he edited, was a revision of the original volume done by [[W</span>
				<span class='text'>H</span>
				<span class='text'>Auden]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Amis took the anthology in a markedly new direction: Auden had interpreted light verse to include &quot;low&quot; verse of working-class or lower-class origin, regardless of subject matter, while Amis defined light verse as essentially light in tone, though not necessarily simple in composition</span>
				<span class='text'>''The Amis Anthology'' (1988), a personal selection of his favourite poems, grew out of his work for a London newspaper, in which he selected a poem daily and presented it with a brief introduction</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Fussell, ''The Anti-Egotist''&lt;/ref&gt;Amis was shortlisted for the [[Man Booker Prize]] three times in his writing career for ''Ending Up'' (1974), ''Jake's Thing'' (1978), and finally winning the prize for ''[[The Old Devils]]'' in 1986</span>

				<span class='text'>om/prize/authors/27 |date=20120224062830 }}&lt;/ref&gt;==Personal life and political views==As a young man at Oxford, Amis briefly joined the [[Communist Party of Great Britain|Communist Party]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He later described this stage of his political life as &quot;the callow Marxist phase that seemed almost compulsory in Oxford&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See Amis's ''Socialism and the Intellectuals'', cited by Leader, 2006, p</span>
				<span class='text'>366</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Amis remained nominally on the Left for some time after the war, declaring in the 1950s that he would always vote for the Labour Party</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Leader, 2006, p</span>
				<span class='text'>366&lt;/ref&gt; But he eventually moved further right, a development he discussed in the essay &quot;Why Lucky Jim Turned Right&quot; (1967); his conservatism and anti-communism can be seen in such later works of his as the [[utopian and dystopian fiction|dystopian novel]] ''Russian Hide and Seek'' (1980)</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=September 2009}} In 1967, Amis, [[Robert Conquest]], [[John Braine]] and several other right-wing authors signed a controversial letter to ''[[The Times]]'' entitled &quot;Backing for U</span>

				<span class='text'>140&lt;/ref&gt;Amis was by his own admission and as revealed by his biographers a serial [[adulterer]] for much of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>This was one of the main contributory factors in the breakdown of his first marriage</span>
				<span class='text'>A famous photograph of a sleeping Amis on a Yugoslav beach shows the slogan (written by wife Hilly) on his back &quot;1 Fat Englishman – I fuck anything&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Leader 2006, opp p565&lt;/ref&gt;In one of his memoirs, Amis wrote: &quot;Now and then I become conscious of having the reputation of being one of the great drinkers, if not one of the great drunks, of our time&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;booze&quot;&gt;Memoirs: Booze&lt;/ref&gt; He suggests that this is the result of a naïve tendency on the part of his readers to apply the behaviour of his characters to himself</span>
				<span class='text'>This was disingenuous; the fact was that he enjoyed drink, and spent a good deal of his time in pubs</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Hilary Rubinstein]], who accepted ''Lucky Jim'' for publication at Victor Gollancz, commented: &quot;I doubted whether Jim Dixon would have gone to the pub and drunk ten pints of beer </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>I didn't know Kingsley very well, you see</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Bradford, Ch 5&lt;/ref&gt; Clive James comments: &quot;All on his own, he had the weekly drinks bill of a whole table at the [[Garrick Club]] even before he was elected</span>
				<span class='text'>After he was, he would get so tight there that he could barely make it to the taxi</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Clive James, &quot;Kingsley without the women&quot;, ''[[The Times Literary Supplement|Times Literary Supplement]]'', 2 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Amis was, however, adamant in his belief that inspiration did not come from a bottle: &quot;Whatever part drink may play in the writer's life, it must play none in his or her work</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;booze&quot;/&gt; That this was certainly the case is attested to by Amis's highly disciplined approach to writing</span>
				<span class='text'>For 'many years',&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, 1995, p</span>
				<span class='text'>17&lt;/ref&gt; Amis imposed a rigorous daily schedule upon himself in which writing and drinking were strictly segregated</span>
				<span class='text'>Mornings were devoted to writing with a minimum daily output of 500 words</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, 1995, p</span>
				<span class='text'>6</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The drinking would only begin around lunchtime when this output had been achieved</span>
				<span class='text'>Amis's prodigious output would not have been possible without this kind of self-discipline</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, according to [[Clive James]], Amis reached a turning point when his drinking ceased to be social, and became a way of dulling his remorse and regret at his behaviour toward Hilly</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Amis had turned against himself deliberately </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>it seems fair to guess that the troubled grandee came to disapprove of his own conduct</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; His friend [[Christopher Hitchens]] said: &quot;The booze got to him in the end, and robbed him of his wit and charm as well as of his health</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kingsley Amis, ''Everyday Drinking'', [[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury USA]], NY, 2008, editor's introduction</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Amis had a somewhat complex relationship with anti-Semitism, which he sometimes expressed but also disliked and opposed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Anthony Julius, ''Trials of the Diaspora, A History of Anti-Semitism in England'', [[Oxford University Press|Oxford Univ</span>
				<span class='text'>Press]], 2010, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>357–358&lt;/ref&gt; He occasionally speculated on the historically received, and commonly accepted, stereotypes attributed (and supposedly intrinsic) to Jewish character</span>
				<span class='text'>Anti-semitism was sometimes present in his conversations and letters written to friends and associates: &quot;The great Jewish vice is glibness, fluency </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>also possibly just bullshit, as in Marx, Freud, Marcuse</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Or, &quot;Chaplin is a horse's arse</span>
				<span class='text'>He's a Jeeeew you see, like the Marx Brothers, like Danny Kaye</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; It is a minor theme in his novel about a paranoid schizophrenic, &quot;Stanley and the Women&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>As for the cultural complexion of America, Amis had this to say: &quot;I've finally worked out why I don't like Americans </span>
