				<span class='text'>Francis Xavier is noteworthy for his [[missionary work]], both as organizer and as pioneer, reputed to have converted more people than anyone else has done since [[Saint Paul]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Pope Benedict XVI]] said of both [[Ignatius of Loyola]] and Francis Xavier: &quot;not only their history which was interwoven for many years from [[Paris]] and Rome, but a unique desire — a unique passion, it could be said — moved and sustained them through different human events: the passion to give to God-Trinity a glory always greater and to work for the proclamation of the Gospel of Christ to the peoples who had been ignored</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=benedict/&gt; By consulting with the earlier ancient [[Christians of St</span>
				<span class='text'>Thomas]] in India, Xavier developed Jesuit missionary methods</span>
				<span class='text'>His success also spurred many Europeans to join the order, as well as become missionaries throughout the world</span>
				<span class='text'>His personal efforts most affected Christians in [[India]] and the [[East Indies]] ([[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Timor]])</span>
				<span class='text'>India still has numerous Jesuit missions, and many more schools</span>
				<span class='text'>Xavier also worked to propagate Christianity in [[China]] and [[Japan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>However, following the persecutions of [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] and the subsequent closing of Japan to foreigners, the Christians of Japan were forced to go underground to develop an independent Christian culture</span>
				<span class='text'>Likewise, while Xavier inspired many missionaries to China, Chinese Christians also were forced underground and developed their own Christian culture</span>
				<span class='text'>rancis Xavier is the patron saint of his native [[Navarre]], which celebrates his feast day on 3 December as a government holiday</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition to Roman Catholic masses remembering Xavier on that day (now known as the Day of Navarra), celebrations in the surrounding weeks honor the region's cultural heritage</span>
				<span class='text'>Furthermore, in the 1940s, devoted Catholics instituted the [[Javierada]], an annual day-long pilgrimage (often on foot) from the capital at [[Pamplona]] to Xavier, where his order has built a basilica and museum and restored his family's castle</span>

				<span class='text'>And while some of Xavier's methods have been since criticized (he forced converts to take [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] names and dress in Western clothes, approved the persecution of the [[Eastern Orthodox|Eastern Church]], and used the [[Goa]] government as a missionary tool), he has also earned praise</span>
				<span class='text'>He insisted that missionaries adapt to many of the customs, and most certainly the language, of the culture they wish to evangelize</span>
