				<span class='text'>]]Marcel Duchamp was born in [[Blainville-Crevon]] [[Seine-Maritime]] in the [[Upper Normandy]] region of France, and grew up in a family that enjoyed cultural activities</span>
				<span class='text'>The art of painter and engraver {{ill|fr|Émile Frédéric Nicolle}}, his maternal grandfather, filled the house, and the family liked to play chess, read books, paint, and make music together</span>
				<span class='text'>f Eugene and Lucie Duchamp's seven children, one died as an infant and four became successful artists</span>
				<span class='text'>Marcel Duchamp was the brother of:*[[Jacques Villon]] (1875–1963), painter, printmaker*[[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]] (1876–1918), sculptor*[[Suzanne Duchamp|Suzanne Duchamp-Crotti]] (1889–1963), painter</span>
				<span class='text'>s a child, with his two older brothers already away from home at school in Rouen, Duchamp was close to his sister Suzanne, who was a willing accomplice in games and activities conjured by his fertile imagination</span>
				<span class='text'>At 8 years old, Duchamp followed in his brothers' footsteps when he left home and began schooling at the [[Lycée Pierre-Corneille]], in Rouen</span>
				<span class='text'>Two other students in his class also became well-known artists and lasting friends: [[Robert Antoine Pinchon]] and [[Pierre Dumont (painter)|Pierre Dumont]]</span>

				<span class='text'>271] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the next 8 years, he was locked into an educational regime which focused on intellectual development</span>
				<span class='text'>Though he was not an outstanding student, his best subject was mathematics and he won two mathematics prizes at the school</span>
				<span class='text'>He also won a prize for drawing in 1903, and at his commencement in 1904 he won a coveted first prize, validating his recent decision to become an artist</span>
				<span class='text'>e learned academic drawing from a teacher who unsuccessfully attempted to protect his students from [[Impressionism]], [[Post-Impressionism]], and other avant-garde influences</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Duchamp's true artistic mentor at the time was his brother Jacques Villon, whose fluid and incisive style he sought to imitate</span>
				<span class='text'>At 14, his first serious art attempts were drawings and watercolors depicting his sister Suzanne in various poses and activities</span>
				<span class='text'>That summer he also painted landscapes in an Impressionist style using oils</span>
				<span class='text'>=Early work==Duchamp's early art works align with [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionist]] styles</span>
				<span class='text'>He experimented with classical techniques and subjects</span>
				<span class='text'>When he was later asked about what had influenced him at the time, Duchamp cited the work of [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist painter]] [[Odilon Redon]], whose approach to art was not outwardly anti-academic, but quietly individual</span>

				<span class='text'>This painting was identified as a self-portrait by the artist</span>
				<span class='text'>Duchamp's primary concern in this painting is the depiction of two movements; that of the train in which there is a young man smoking, and that of the lurching figure itself</span>

				<span class='text'>During this time Duchamp drew and sold cartoons which reflected his ribald humor</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of the drawings use verbal [[pun]]s (sometimes spanning multiple languages), [[visual pun]]s, or both</span>
				<span class='text'>Such play with words and symbols engaged his imagination for the rest of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1905, he began his compulsory military service with the 39th Infantry Regiment,&lt;ref name=&quot;François Lespinasse&quot;&gt;François Lespinasse, ''Robert Antoine Pinchon: 1886&amp;ndash;1943'', 1990, repr</span>

				<span class='text'>There he learned [[typography]] and [[printing]] processes—skills he would use in his later work</span>
				<span class='text'>ue to his eldest brother [[Jacques Villon|Jacques']] membership in the prestigious [[Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture]] Duchamp's work was exhibited in the 1908 [[Salon d'Automne]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The following year his work was featured in the [[Salon des Indépendants]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Of Duchamp's pieces in the show, critic [[Guillaume Apollinaire]]—who was to become a friend—criticized what he called &quot;Duchamp's very ugly nudes&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Duchamp also became lifelong friends with exuberant artist [[Francis Picabia]] after meeting him at the 1911 Salon d'Automne, and Picabia proceeded to introduce him to a lifestyle of fast cars and &quot;high&quot; living</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1911, at Jacques' home in [[Puteaux]], the brothers hosted a regular discussion group with [[Cubism|Cubist]] artists including [[Francis Picabia|Picabia]], [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Roger de La Fresnaye]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Juan Gris]], and [[Alexander Archipenko]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Poets and writers also participated</span>
				<span class='text'>The group came to be known as the [[Puteaux Group]], or the [[Section d'Or]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Uninterested in the Cubists' seriousness or in their focus on visual matters, Duchamp did not join in discussions of Cubist theory, and gained a reputation of being shy</span>
				<span class='text'>However, that same year he painted in a Cubist style, and added an impression of motion by using repetitive imagery</span>
				<span class='text'>uring this period Duchamp's fascination with transition, change, movement and distance became manifest, and like many artists of the time, he was intrigued with the concept of depicting the [[fourth dimension in art]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ian Chilvers &amp; John Glaves-Smith, ''A Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art''</span>
				<span class='text'>Oxford University Press, p</span>
				<span class='text'>204&lt;/ref&gt; His painting ''Sad Young Man on a Train'' embodies this concern:&lt;blockquote&gt;First, there's the idea of the movement of the train, and then that of the sad young man who is in a corridor and who is moving about; thus there are two parallel movements corresponding to each other</span>
				<span class='text'>Then, there is the distortion of the young man—I had called this ''elementary parallelism''</span>
				<span class='text'>It was a formal decomposition; that is, linear elements following each other like parallels and distorting the object</span>
				<span class='text'>The object is completely stretched out, as if elastic</span>
				<span class='text'>The lines follow each other in parallels, while changing subtly to form the movement, or the form of the young man in question</span>
				<span class='text'>I also used this procedure in the ''Nude Descending a Staircase''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cabanne, 1971 p</span>
				<span class='text'>9</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Works from this period included his first &quot;machine&quot; painting, ''Coffee Mill (Moulin à café)'' (1911), which he gave to his brother Raymond Duchamp-Villon</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''Coffee Mill'' shows similarity to the &quot;grinder&quot; mechanism of the ''Large Glass'' he was to paint years later</span>
				<span class='text'>n his 1911, ''Portrait of Chess Players'' (''Portrait de joueurs d'échecs'') there is the Cubist overlapping frames and multiple perspectives of his two brothers playing chess, but to that Duchamp added elements conveying the unseen mental activity of the players</span>

				<span class='text'>2]]'' ''(Nu descendant un escalier n° 2)'' (1912)</span>
				<span class='text'>The painting depicts the mechanistic motion of a nude, with superimposed facets, similar to motion pictures</span>
				<span class='text'>It shows elements of both the fragmentation and synthesis of the [[Cubism|Cubists]], and the movement and dynamism of the [[futurism (art)|Futurists]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Duchamp's brothers did approach him with Gleizes' request, but Duchamp quietly refused</span>
				<span class='text'>However, there was no jury at the Salon des Indépendants and Gleizes was in no position to reject the painting</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Peter Brooke&quot; /&gt; The controversy, according to art historian Peter Brooke, was not whether the work should be hung or not, but whether or not it should be hung with the Cubist group</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Peter Brooke&quot; /&gt;Of the incident Duchamp later recalled, &quot;I said nothing to my brothers</span>
				<span class='text'>But I went immediately to the show and took my painting home in a taxi</span>
				<span class='text'>It was really a turning point in my life, I can assure you</span>
				<span class='text'>I saw that I would not be very much interested in groups after that</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tomkins|1996|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Duchamp did appear in the illustrations to ''[[Du &quot;Cubisme&quot;]]'', he participated in the ''[[Salon d'Automne#La Maison Cubiste (Cubist House)|La Maison Cubiste (Cubist House)]]'', organized by the designer [[André Mare]] for the [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1912 (a few months after the Indépendants); he signed the [[Section d'Or]] invitation and participated in the Section d'Or exhibition during the fall of 1912</span>
				<span class='text'>The impression is, Brooke writes, &quot;it was precisely because he wished to remain part of the group that he withdrew the painting; and that, far from being ill treated by the group, he was given a rather privileged position, probably through the patronage of Picabia&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Peter Brooke&quot; /&gt;He later submitted the painting to the 1913 &quot;[[Armory Show]]&quot; in New York City</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition to displaying works of American artists, this show was the first major exhibition of modern trends coming out of Paris, encompassing experimental styles of the European [[avant-garde]], including [[Fauvism]], [[Cubism]], and [[Futurism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>American show-goers, accustomed to realistic art, were scandalized, and the ''Nude'' was at the center of much of the controversy</span>
				<span class='text'>=Leaving &quot;retinal art&quot; behind==At about this time, Duchamp read [[Max Stirner]]'s philosophical tract, ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'', the study of which he considered another turning point in his artistic and intellectual development</span>
				<span class='text'>He called it &quot;a remarkable book </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>which advances no formal theories, but just keeps saying that the ego is always there in everything</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tomkins|1996|p=unknown}}&lt;/ref&gt;While in Munich in 1912, he painted the last of his Cubist-like paintings and he started &quot;Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even&quot; image, and began making plans for ''The Large Glass'' – scribbling short notes to himself, sometimes with hurried sketches</span>
				<span class='text'>It would be over 10 years before this piece was completed</span>
				<span class='text'>Not much else is known about the two-month stay in Munich except that the friend he visited was intent on showing him the sights and the nightlife and that he was influenced by the works of the 16th century German painter Lucas Cranach the Elder in Munich’s famed Alte Pinakothek, known for its Old Master paintings</span>
				<span class='text'>Duchamp recalled that he daily took the short walk to visit this museum</span>
				<span class='text'>Duchamp scholars have long recognized in Cranach the subdued ochre and brown color range Duchamp later employed</span>

				<span class='text'>He credited the drama with having radically changed his approach to art, and having inspired him to begin the creation of his ''[[The Bride Stripped Bare By Her Bachelors, Even]]'', also known as ''The Large Glass''</span>
				<span class='text'>Work on ''The Large Glass'' continued into 1913, with his invention of inventing a repertoire of forms</span>
				<span class='text'>He made notes, sketches and painted studies, and even drew some of his ideas on the wall of his apartment</span>
				<span class='text'>owards the end of 1912, he traveled with Picabia, Apollinaire and Gabrielle Buffet-Picabia through the [[Jura mountains]], an adventure that Buffet-Picabia described as one of their &quot;forays of demoralization, which were also forays of witticism and clownery </span>

				<span class='text'>n 1913, Duchamp withdrew from painting circles and began working as a librarian in the Bibliothèque Sainte-Geneviève to be able to earn a living wage while concentrating on scholarly realms and working on his ''Large Glass''</span>
				<span class='text'>He studied math and physics – areas in which exciting new discoveries were taking place</span>
				<span class='text'>The theoretical writings of [[Henri Poincaré]] particularly intrigued and inspired Duchamp</span>
				<span class='text'>Poincaré postulated that the laws believed to govern matter were created solely by the minds that &quot;understood&quot; them and that no theory could be considered &quot;true&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;The things themselves are not what science can reach</span>

				<span class='text'>To make one of his favorite pieces, ''3 Standard Stoppages'' (''3 stoppages étalon''), he dropped three 1-meter lengths of thread onto prepared canvases, one at a time, from a height of 1 meter</span>
				<span class='text'>The threads landed in three random undulating positions</span>
				<span class='text'>He varnished them into place on the blue-black canvas strips and attached them to glass</span>
				<span class='text'>He then cut three wood slats into the shapes of the curved strings, and put all the pieces into a croquet box</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' 1917]][[Dada]] or Dadaism was an [[art movement]] of the European [[avant-garde]] in the early 20th century</span>
				<span class='text'>It began in [[Zurich]], Switzerland in 1916, spreading to [[Berlin]] shortly thereafter</span>

				<span class='text'>35&amp;ndash;137&lt;/ref&gt; To quote Dona Budd's ''The Language of Art Knowledge'', &lt;blockquote&gt;Dada was born out of negative reaction to the horrors of [[World War I]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This international movement was begun by a group of artists and poets associated with the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zurich)|Cabaret Voltaire]] in Zurich</span>
				<span class='text'>Dada rejected reason and logic, prizing nonsense, irrationality and intuition</span>
				<span class='text'>The origin of the name Dada is unclear; some believe that it is a nonsensical word</span>
				<span class='text'>Others maintain that it originates from the Romanian artists [[Tristan Tzara]] and [[Marcel Janco]]'s frequent use of the words da, da, meaning yes, yes in the [[Romanian language|Romanian]] language</span>
				<span class='text'>Another theory says that the name &quot;Dada&quot; came during a meeting of the group when a paper knife stuck into a French-German dictionary happened to point to 'dada', a French word for 'hobbyhorse'</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Budd, Dona, ''The Language of Art Knowledge'', Pomegranate Communications, Inc</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The movement primarily involved [[visual arts]], literature, poetry, [[art manifesto]]es, [[aesthetics|art theory]], theatre, and [[graphic design]], and concentrated its [[anti-war]] politics through a rejection of the prevailing standards in art through [[anti-art]] cultural works</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition to being anti-war, Dada was also anti-[[bourgeois]] and had political affinities with the radical left</span>
				<span class='text'>ada activities included public gatherings, demonstrations, and publication of art/literary journals; passionate coverage of art, politics, and culture were topics often discussed in a variety of media</span>
				<span class='text'>Key figures in the movement included [[Hugo Ball]], [[Emmy Hennings]], [[Hans Arp]], [[Raoul Hausmann]], [[Hannah Höch]], [[Johannes Baader]], [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Francis Picabia]], [[Richard Huelsenbeck]], [[Georg Grosz]], [[John Heartfield]], Marcel Duchamp, [[Beatrice Wood]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], and [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]], among others</span>
				<span class='text'>The movement influenced later styles like the [[avant-garde]] and [[downtown music]] movements, and groups including [[surrealism]], [[Nouveau réalisme]], [[pop art]] and [[Fluxus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;blockquote&gt;Dada is the groundwork to abstract art and sound poetry, a starting point for performance art, a prelude to [[postmodernism]], an influence on pop art, a celebration of antiart to be later embraced for anarcho-political uses in the 1960s and the movement that lay the foundation for Surrealism</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Marc Lowenthal, translator's introduction to [[Francis Picabia]]'s ''I Am a Beautiful Monster: Poetry, Prose, And Provocation''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;New York Dada had a less serious tone than that of European Dadaism, and was not a particularly organized venture</span>
				<span class='text'>Duchamp's friend Francis Picabia connected with the Dada group in Zürich, bringing to New York the Dadaist ideas of absurdity and &quot;anti-art&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Duchamp and Picabia first met in September 1911 at the Salon d'Automne in Paris, where they were both exhibiting</span>
				<span class='text'> Duchamp showed a larger version of his ''Young Man and Girl in Spring'' 1911, a work that had an Edenic theme and a thinly veiled sexuality also found in Picabia's contemporaneous ''Adam and Eve'' 1911</span>

				<span class='text'>12&lt;/ref&gt; A group met almost nightly at the [[Walter Arensberg|Arensberg]] home, or caroused in [[Greenwich Village]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Together with [[Man Ray]], Duchamp contributed his ideas and humor to the New York activities, many of which ran concurrent with the development of his [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|Readymades]] and 'The Large Glass</span>
				<span class='text'>The most prominent example of Duchamp's association with Dada was his submission of ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'', a urinal, to the [[Society of Independent Artists]] exhibit in 1917</span>
				<span class='text'>Artworks in the Independent Artists shows were not selected by jury, and all pieces submitted were displayed</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the show committee insisted that ''Fountain'' was not art, and rejected it from the show</span>
				<span class='text'>This caused an uproar amongst the Dadaists, and led Duchamp to resign from the board of the Independent Artists</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;TomkinsBio&quot;/&gt;{{rp|181–186}}Along with [[Henri-Pierre Roché]] and [[Beatrice Wood]], Duchamp published a Dada magazine in New York, titled ''[[The Blind Man]]'', which included art, literature, humor and commentary</span>

				<span class='text'>He executed the work on two panes of glass with materials such as lead foil, fuse wire, and dust</span>
				<span class='text'>It combines chance procedures, plotted perspective studies, and laborious craftsmanship</span>
				<span class='text'>He published notes for the piece, ''The Green Box'', intended to complement the visual experience</span>
				<span class='text'>They reflect the creation of unique rules of physics, and a mythology which describes the work</span>
				<span class='text'>He stated that his &quot;hilarious picture&quot; is intended to depict the erotic encounter between a bride and her nine bachelors</span>
				<span class='text'>he piece was inspired by a performance of the stage adaptation of [[Raymond Roussel|Roussel]]'s novel ''Impressions d'Afrique'' which Duchamp attended in 1912</span>
				<span class='text'>Notes, sketches and plans for the work were drawn on Duchamp's studio walls as early as 1913</span>
				<span class='text'>In order to concentrate on the work free from material obligations, Duchamp found work as a librarian while living in France</span>
				<span class='text'>After emigrating to the United States in 1915, he commenced his work on the piece financed by the support of the Arensbergs</span>
				<span class='text'>he piece is partially constructed as a retrospective of Duchamp's works, including a three-dimensional reproduction of his earlier paintings ''Bride'' (1912), ''Chocolate Grinder'' (1914) and ''Glider containing a water mill in neighboring metals'' (1913–1915), which has opened for numerous interpretations</span>
				<span class='text'>The work was formally declared &quot;Unfinished&quot; in 1923</span>
				<span class='text'>Going home from its first public exhibition, the glass broke in its shipping crate and received a large crack in the glass</span>
				<span class='text'>Duchamp repaired it, but left the cracks in the glass intact, accepting the chance element as a part of the piece</span>

				<span class='text'>Photograph by [[Man Ray]], published in [[391 (magazine)|391]], July 1920 (N13), [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York]]Duchamp's interest in [[kinetic art|kinetic works]] can be discerned as early as the notes for ''[[The Large Glass]]'' and the ''[[Bicycle Wheel]]'' readymade, and despite losing interest in &quot;retinal art&quot;, he retained interest in visual phenomena</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1920, with help from [[Man Ray]], Duchamp built a motorized sculpture, ''Rotative plaques verre, optique de précision'' (&quot;Rotary Glass Plates, Precision Optics&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>The piece, which he did not consider to be art, involved a motor to spin pieces of rectangular glass on which were painted segments of a circle</span>
				<span class='text'>When the apparatus spins, an optical illusion occurs, in which the segments appear to be closed concentric circles</span>
				<span class='text'>Man Ray set up equipment to photograph the initial experiment, but when they turned the machine on for the second time, a belt broke, and caught a piece of the glass, which after glancing off Man Ray's head, shattered into bits</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;TomkinsBio&quot;/&gt;{{rp|227–228}}After moving back to Paris in 1923, at [[André Breton]]'s urging and through the financing of [[Jacques Doucet (fashion designer)|Jacques Doucet]], Duchamp built another optical device based on the first one, ''Rotative Demisphère, optique de précision'' (Rotary Demisphere, Precision Optics)</span>
				<span class='text'>This time the optical element was a globe cut in half, with black concentric circles painted on it</span>
				<span class='text'>When it spins, the circles appear to move backwards and forwards in space</span>
				<span class='text'>Duchamp asked that Doucet not exhibit the apparatus as art</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;TomkinsBio&quot;/&gt;{{rp|254–255}}''Rotoreliefs'' were the next phase of Duchamp's spinning works</span>
				<span class='text'>To make the optical &quot;play toys&quot;, he painted designs on flat cardboard circles and spun them on a phonographic turntable</span>
				<span class='text'>When spinning, the flat disks appeared three-dimensional</span>
				<span class='text'>He had a printer produce 500 sets of six of the designs, and set up a booth at a 1935 Paris inventors' show to sell them</span>
				<span class='text'>The venture was a financial disaster, but some optical scientists thought they might be of use in restoring three-dimensional stereoscopic sight to people who have lost vision in one eye</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;TomkinsBio&quot;/&gt;{{rp|301–303}} In collaboration with Man Ray and [[Marc Allégret]], Duchamp filmed early versions of the ''Rotoreliefs'' and they named the film ''[[Anemic Cinema|Anémic Cinéma]]'' (1926)</span>
				<span class='text'>Later, in [[Alexander Calder]]'s studio in 1931, while looking at the sculptor's kinetic works, Duchamp suggested that these should be called &quot;[[Mobile (sculpture)|mobile]]s&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Calder agreed to use this novel term in his upcoming show</span>

				<span class='text'>At least three pieces have survived: two compositions and a note for a musical happening</span>
				<span class='text'>The two compositions are based on [[Aleatoric music|chance operations]]</span>
				<span class='text'>''Erratum Musical'', written for three voices, was published in 1934</span>
				<span class='text'>''La Mariée mise à nu par ses célibataires même</span>
				<span class='text'>Erratum Musical'' is unfinished and was never published or exhibited during Duchamp's lifetime</span>
				<span class='text'>According to the manuscript, the piece was intended for a mechanical instrument &quot;in which the virtuoso intermediary is suppressed&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>In the following years, his participation in chess tournaments declined, but he discovered [[correspondence chess]] and became a chess journalist, writing weekly newspaper columns</span>
				<span class='text'>While his contemporaries were achieving spectacular success in the art world by selling their works to high-society collectors, Duchamp observed,  &quot;I am still a victim of chess</span>
				<span class='text'>It has all the beauty of art—and much more</span>
				<span class='text'>It cannot be [[commercialized]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Chess is much purer than art in its social position</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Time Magazine</span>
				<span class='text'>10 March 1952&lt;/ref&gt; On another occasion, Duchamp elaborated, &quot;The chess pieces are the block alphabet which shapes thoughts; and these thoughts, although making a visual design on the chess-board, express their beauty abstractly, like a poem</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>I have come to the personal conclusion that while all artists are not chess players, all chess players are artists</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Marcel Duchamp</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Kynaston McShine</span>
				<span class='text'>989</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In 1932, Duchamp teamed with chess theorist [[Vitaly Halberstadt]] to publish ''L'opposition et cases conjuguées sont réconciliées'' ([[Opposition (chess)|Opposition]] and Sister Squares are Reconciled), known as [[corresponding squares]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This treatise describes the [[Corresponding squares#Lasker-Reichhelm position|Lasker-Reichhelm position]], an extremely rare type of position that can arise in the [[Chess endgame|endgame]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Using [[Enneagram (geometry)|enneagram]]-like charts that fold upon themselves, the authors demonstrated that in this position, the most Black can hope for is a [[Draw (chess)|draw]]</span>
				<span class='text'>he theme of the &quot;endgame&quot; is important to an understanding of Duchamp's complex attitude towards his artistic career</span>
				<span class='text'>Irish playwright [[Samuel Beckett]] was an associate of Duchamp, and used the theme as the narrative device for the 1957 play of the same name, ''[[Endgame (play)|Endgame]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1968, Duchamp played an artistically important chess match with avant-garde composer [[John Cage]], at a concert entitled &quot;Reunion&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Music was produced by a series of photoelectric cells underneath the chessboard, triggered sporadically by normal game play</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;toutfait</span>
				<span class='text'>om&quot;/&gt;On choosing a career in chess, Duchamp said, &quot;If [[Bobby Fischer]] came to me for advice, I certainly would not discourage him—as if anyone could—but I would try to make it positively clear that he will never have any money from chess, live a monk-like existence and know more rejection than any artist ever has, struggling to be known and accepted</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brady, Frank: ''Bobby Fischer: profile of a prodigy'', Courier Dover Publications, 1989; p</span>
				<span class='text'>207</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Duchamp left a legacy to chess in the form of an enigmatic endgame problem he composed in 1943</span>
				<span class='text'>The problem was included in the announcement for Julian Levi's gallery exhibition ''Through the Big End of the Opera Glass'', printed on translucent paper with the faint inscription: &quot;White to play and win&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Grandmasters and endgame specialists have since grappled with the problem, with most concluding that there is no solution</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Later artistic involvement==Although Duchamp was no longer considered to be an active artist, he continued to consult with artists, art dealers and collectors</span>
				<span class='text'>From 1925 he often traveled between France and the United States, and made New York's Greenwich Village his home in 1942</span>
				<span class='text'>He also occasionally worked on artistic projects such as the short film ''[[Anemic Cinema]]'' (1926), ''Box in a Valise'' (1935–41), ''Self Portrait in Profile'' (1958) and the larger work ''Étant Donnés'' (1946–66)</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1943, he participated with [[Maya Deren]] in her unfinished film ''[[The Witch's Cradle]]'', filmed in [[Peggy Guggenheim]]'s [[Art of This Century gallery]]</span>
				<span class='text'>rom the mid-1930s onwards, he collaborated with the [[surrealism|Surrealists]]; however, he did not join the movement, despite the coaxing of [[André Breton]]</span>
				<span class='text'>From then until 1944, together with [[Max Ernst]], [[Eugenio Granell]] and Breton, Duchamp edited the Surrealist periodical ''[[VVV (magazine)|VVV]]'', and also served as an advisory editor for the magazine ''[[View (magazine)|View]]'', which featured him in its March 1945 edition, thus introducing him to a broader American audience</span>
				<span class='text'>uchamp's influence on the art world remained behind the scenes until the late 1950s, when he was &quot;discovered&quot; by young artists such as [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Jasper Johns]], who were eager to escape the dominance of [[Abstract Expressionism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a co-founder of the international literary group [[Oulipo]] in 1960</span>
				<span class='text'>Interest in Duchamp was reignited in the 1960s, and he gained international public recognition</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1963, the [[Pasadena Art Museum]] mounted his first retrospective exhibition, and there he appeared in an iconic photograph playing chess opposite nude model [[Eve Babitz]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Other major institutions, including the [[Philadelphia Art Museum]] and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], followed with large showings of Duchamp's work</span>
				<span class='text'>He was invited to lecture on art and to participate in formal discussions, as well as sitting for interviews with major publications</span>
				<span class='text'>As the last surviving member of the Duchamp family of artists, in 1967 Duchamp helped to organize an exhibition in Rouen, France, called ''Les Duchamp: Jacques Villon, Raymond Duchamp-Villon, Marcel Duchamp, Suzanne Duchamp''</span>
				<span class='text'>Parts of this family exhibition were later shown again at the [[Musée National d'Art Moderne]] in Paris</span>
				<span class='text'>==Exhibition design===Duchamp participated in the design of the 1938 International Surrealist Exhibition, which was held at the ''Galerie des Beaux-arts'', Paris</span>
				<span class='text'>The show featured more than 60 artists from different countries, including approximately 300 paintings, objects, collages, photographs, and installations</span>
				<span class='text'>The surrealists wanted to create an exhibition which in itself would be a creative act, and André Breton named Duchamp, [[Wolfgang Paalen]], [[Man Ray]], [[Salvador Dali]], and [[Max Ernst]] to help him</span>
				<span class='text'>At the exhibition's entrance he{{who|date=May 2015}} placed [[Salvador Dalí]]'s ''[[Rainy Taxi]]'', a work consisting of a [[taxicab]] rigged to produce a drizzle of water down the inside of its windows, with a shark-headed creature in the driver's seat, and a blond [[mannequin]] covered with live [[snail]]s in the back</span>
				<span class='text'>In this way Duchamp confronted guests entering the exhibition, who were in full evening dress</span>
				<span class='text'>'Surrealist Street'' filled one side of the lobby with mannequins dressed by various surrealists</span>
				<span class='text'>The main hall was a simulation of a dark subterranean cave with 1,200 empty coal bags suspended from the ceiling</span>
				<span class='text'>The floor was covered by Paalen with dead leaves and mud from the [[Montparnasse Cemetery]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In the middle of the grand hall underneath Duchamp´s coal sacks, Paalen installed an artificial water-filled pond with real [[water lily|water lilies]] and reeds, which he called ''Avant La Mare''</span>
				<span class='text'>Illumination was provided only by a single light bulb,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>Much to the surrealists' satisfaction, the exhibition scandalized many of the guests</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1942, for the ''First Papers of Surrealism'' show in New York, surrealists called on Duchamp to design the exhibition</span>
