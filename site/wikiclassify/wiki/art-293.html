				<span class='text'>Polk was the surprise ([[dark horse]]) candidate for president in 1844, defeating [[Henry Clay]] of the rival [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] by promising to annex [[Republic of Texas|Texas]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Polk was a leader of [[Jacksonian Democracy]] during the [[Second Party System]]</span>
				<span class='text'> His nickname was &quot;Young Hickory&quot; because of his close association with &quot;Old Hickory&quot;, [[Andrew Jackson]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Polk is often considered the last strong pre–[[American Civil War|Civil War]] president, having met during his four years in office every major domestic and foreign policy goal set during his campaign and the transition to his administration:  When Mexico rejected American annexation of Texas, Polk led the nation to a sweeping victory in the [[Mexican–American War]], seizing nearly the whole of what is now the [[Southwestern United States|American Southwest]]</span>
				<span class='text'> He ensured a substantial reduction of tariff rates by replacing the &quot;[[Black Tariff]]&quot; with the [[Walker tariff]] of 1846, which pleased the less-industrialized states of his native South by rendering less expensive both imported and, through competition, domestic goods</span>
				<span class='text'> He threatened war with the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] over the issue of which nation owned the [[Oregon Country]], eventually reaching a settlement in which the British were made to sell the portion that became the [[Oregon Territory]]</span>
				<span class='text'> He built an independent treasury system that lasted until 1913</span>
				<span class='text'> Having done all this, he fulfilled his campaign promise not to seek election to a second term</span>

				<span class='text'>In January 1816, he transferred and was admitted into the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]] as a second-semester sophomore</span>

				<span class='text'>Calhoun]], and [[Levi Woodbury]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The primary point of political contention involved the [[Republic of Texas]], which, after declaring independence from Mexico in 1836, had asked to join the United States, but was refused by Washington</span>
				<span class='text'>Van Buren opposed the annexation but in doing so lost the support of many Democrats, including former President Andrew Jackson, who still had much influence</span>
				<span class='text'>Van Buren won a simple majority on the convention's first ballot but did not attain the two-thirds supermajority required for nomination</span>
				<span class='text'>In subsequent rounds the vote swung toward Cass, but he also fell short of the supermajority</span>
				<span class='text'>When it became clear after another six ballots that neither of the front-runners would win the required majority, Polk emerged as a &quot;[[dark horse]]&quot; candidate</span>
				<span class='text'>After an indecisive eighth ballot, the convention unanimously nominated Polk</span>

				<span class='text'>Even with this support, Polk instructed his managers at the convention to support Van Buren if he could win the nomination</span>
				<span class='text'>This assured that if a deadlocked convention occurred, initial supporters of Van Buren would pick Polk as a compromise candidate for the Democrats</span>
				<span class='text'>In the end, this is exactly what happened as a result of Polk's support of westward expansion</span>

				<span class='text'>I have never sought it, nor should I feel at liberty to decline it, if conferred upon me by the voluntary [[suffrage]]s of my fellow citizens</span>

				<span class='text'> The [[Texas Annexation|annexation of Texas]], which was at the forefront during the Democratic Convention, again dominated the campaign</span>
				<span class='text'>Polk was a strong proponent of immediate annexation, while Clay seemed more equivocal and vacillating</span>
				<span class='text'>nother campaign issue, also related to westward expansion, involved the [[Oregon Country]], then under the joint occupation of the United States and the United Kingdom</span>
				<span class='text'>The Democrats had championed the cause of expansion, informally linking the controversial Texas annexation issue with a claim to the entire Oregon Country, thus appealing to both Northern and Southern expansionists</span>

				<span class='text'>1849), photograph by [[Mathew Brady]]]]When he took office on March 4, 1845, Polk, at 49, became the youngest man at the time to assume the presidency</span>
				<span class='text'>According to a story told decades later by [[George Bancroft]], Polk set four clearly defined goals for his administration:* Reestablish the [[Independent Treasury|Independent Treasury System]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Reduce [[Tariffs in American history|tariffs]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Acquire some or all of [[Oregon boundary dispute|Oregon Country]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Acquire [[California]] and [[New Mexico]] from [[Mexico]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ledged to serve only one term, he accomplished all these objectives in just four years</span>
				<span class='text'>By linking acquisition of new lands in Oregon (with no slavery) and Texas (with slavery), he hoped to satisfy both North and South</span>

				<span class='text'>Polk was known as &quot;Young Hickory&quot;, an allusion to his mentor [[Andrew Jackson]], and &quot;Napoleon of the [[Stump speech (politics)|Stump]]&quot; for his speaking skills</span>
				<span class='text'>==Fiscal policy===In 1846, Congress approved the [[Walker tariff|Walker Tariff]] (named after [[Robert J</span>
				<span class='text'>Walker]], the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]]), which represented a substantial reduction of the high Whig-backed [[Tariff of 1842]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Polk's actions were popular in the South and West; however, they were despised by many [[protectionism|protectionists]] in [[Pennsylvania]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1846, Polk approved a law restoring the Independent Treasury System, under which government funds were held in the Treasury and not in banks or other financial institutions</span>
				<span class='text'>This established independent treasury deposit offices, separate from private or state banks, to receive all government funds</span>
				<span class='text'>==Rivers and Harbors Veto===Congress passed the [[Rivers and Harbors Bill]] in 1846 to provide $500,000 to improve rivers and harbors, but Polk vetoed the bill</span>
				<span class='text'>It would have provided for federally funded [[internal improvements]] on small harbors</span>
				<span class='text'>Polk believed that this was unconstitutional because the bill unfairly favored particular areas, including ports which had no foreign trade</span>
				<span class='text'>Polk believed that these problems were local and not national</span>
				<span class='text'>Polk feared that passing the Rivers and Harbors Bill would encourage legislators to compete for favors for their home districts – a type of [[Political corruption|corruption]] that would spell doom to the [[Republicanism in the United States|virtue of the republic]]</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|left|thumb|200px|President Polk, 1858 portrait, by [[George Peter Alexander Healy|George Healy]]]]During his presidency, many abolitionists harshly criticized him as an instrument of the &quot;[[Slave Power]]&quot;, and claimed that spreading slavery was the reason he supported [[Texas Annexation|annexing Texas]] and later [[Mexican-American War|war with Mexico]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Haynes, p</span>
				<span class='text'>154&lt;/ref&gt; Polk stated in his diary that he believed slavery could not exist in the territories won from Mexico,&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger, p</span>
				<span class='text'>453, citing Polk's ''Diary'' II, 289&lt;/ref&gt; but refused to endorse the [[Wilmot Proviso]] that would forbid it there</span>
				<span class='text'>Polk argued instead for extending the [[Missouri Compromise]] line to the Pacific Ocean, which would prohibit the expansion of slavery above 36° 30' west of [[Missouri]], but allow it below that line if approved by eligible voters in the territory</span>
				<span class='text'>[[William Dusinberre]] has argued that Polk's diary, which he kept during his presidency, was written for later publication, and does not represent Polk's policy</span>
				<span class='text'>olk was a slaveholder for his entire life</span>
				<span class='text'>His father, Samuel Polk, had left Polk more than 8,000 acres (32&amp;nbsp;km²) of land, and divided about 53 slaves to his widow and children after he died</span>
				<span class='text'>James inherited twenty of his father's slaves, either directly or from deceased brothers</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1831, he became an absentee cotton planter, sending slaves to clear [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]] land that his father had left him near [[Somerville, Tennessee]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Four years later Polk sold his Somerville plantation and, together with his brother-in-law, bought 920 acres (3</span>
				<span class='text'>&amp;nbsp;km²) of land, a cotton plantation near [[Coffeeville, Mississippi]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He ran this plantation for the rest of his life, eventually taking it over completely from his brother-in-law</span>
				<span class='text'>Polk rarely sold slaves, although once he became President and could better afford it, he bought more</span>
				<span class='text'>Polk's will stipulated that their slaves were to be freed after his wife Sarah had died</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the 1863 [[Emancipation Proclamation]] and the 1865 [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] freed all remaining slaves in rebel states long before the death of his wife in 1891</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Dusinberre, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;===Foreign policy===Polk strongly supported expansion</span>
				<span class='text'>Democrats believed that opening up more land for yeoman farmers was critical for the success of republican virtue</span>
				<span class='text'>(See [[Manifest Destiny]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Like most Southerners, he supported the annexation of Texas</span>
				<span class='text'>To balance the interests of North and South, he wanted to acquire the Oregon Country (present-day [[Oregon]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Idaho]], and [[British Columbia]]) as well</span>
				<span class='text'>He sought to purchase California, which Mexico had neglected</span>
				<span class='text'>===Oregon territory===={{Main|Oregon boundary dispute}}[[File:Wpdms oregon territory 1848</span>
				<span class='text'>ng|frame|The [[Oregon Territory]], established by the [[Oregon Treaty]]]]Polk put heavy pressure on Britain to resolve the [[Oregon boundary dispute]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Since 1818, the territory had been under the joint occupation and control of the United Kingdom and the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>Previous U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>administrations had offered to divide the region along the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]], which was not acceptable to Britain, as they had commercial interests along the [[Columbia River]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the Democratic platform asserted a claim to the entire region, Polk was willing to compromise</span>
				<span class='text'>When the British again refused to accept the 49th parallel boundary proposal, Polk broke off negotiations and returned to the Democratic platform's &quot;All Oregon&quot; demand (which called for all of Oregon up to the 54-40 line that marked the southern boundary of Russian Alaska)</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;54-40 or fight!&quot; now became a popular rallying cry among Democrats</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;This slogan, although often associated with Polk, was the position of his rivals in the Democratic Party, who wanted Polk to be as uncompromising in acquiring the Oregon territory as he had been in annexing Texas</span>
				<span class='text'>This slogan is inappropriately tagged to the Election of 1844, although it didn't come until the year after</span>
				<span class='text'>Borneman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>164, 173</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Polk wanted territory, not war, so he compromised with the British Foreign Secretary, [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Lord Aberdeen]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Oregon Treaty]] of 1846 divided the Oregon Country along the 49th parallel, the original American proposal</span>
				<span class='text'>Although there were many who still clamored for the entire territory, the treaty was approved by the Senate</span>
				<span class='text'>By settling for the 49th parallel, Polk angered many midwestern Democrats</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of these Democrats believed that Polk had always wanted the boundary at the 49th, and that he had fooled them into believing he wanted it at the [[54th parallel north|54th parallel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The portion of the Oregon Territory acquired by the United States later formed the states of [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]], and [[Idaho]], and parts of the states of [[Montana]] and [[Wyoming]]</span>
				<span class='text'>===Texas===={{Main|Texas Annexation}}[[File:Mapa de Mexico 1845</span>
				<span class='text'>NG|thumb|right|300px|Map of Mexico in 1845, with the [[Republic of Texas]], the [[Republic of Yucatan]] and the disputed territory between Mexico and Texas in red</span>
				<span class='text'>Mexico claimed to own all of Texas</span>
				<span class='text'>]Upon hearing of Polk's election to office, Tyler urged Congress to pass a [[joint resolution]] admitting Texas to the [[United States|Union]]; Congress complied on February 28, 1845</span>
				<span class='text'>Texas promptly accepted the offer and officially became a state on December 29, 1845</span>
				<span class='text'>The annexation angered [[Mexico]], which had [[Texas Revolution|lost Texas in 1836]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Mexican politicians had repeatedly warned that annexation would lead to war</span>
				<span class='text'>Nonetheless, just days after the resolution passed Congress, Polk declared in his inaugural address that only Texas and the United States would decide whether to annex</span>
				<span class='text'>==Invasion of Mexico==={{Main|Mexican-American War}}[[File:Polk proclamation</span>
				<span class='text'>if|thumb|left|Polk's presidential proclamation of [[Mexican–American War|war against Mexico]]]]After the Texas annexation, Polk turned his attention to California, hoping to acquire the territory from Mexico before any European nation did so</span>
				<span class='text'>The main interest was [[San Francisco Bay]] as an access point for trade with Asia</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1845, he sent diplomat [[John Slidell]] to Mexico to purchase California and [[New Mexico]] for $24–30&amp;nbsp;million</span>
				<span class='text'>Slidell's arrival caused political turmoil in Mexico after word leaked out that he was there to purchase additional territory and not to offer compensation for the loss of Texas</span>
				<span class='text'>The Mexicans refused to receive Slidell, citing a technical problem with his credentials</span>
				<span class='text'>In January 1846, to increase pressure on Mexico to negotiate, Polk sent troops under General [[Zachary Taylor]] into the area between the [[Nueces River]] and the [[Rio Grande]]—territory that was claimed by both the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>and Mexico</span>
				<span class='text'>lidell returned to Washington in May 1846, having been rebuffed by the Mexican government</span>
				<span class='text'>Polk regarded this treatment of his diplomat as an insult and an &quot;ample cause of war&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Haynes, p</span>
				<span class='text'>129&lt;/ref&gt; and he prepared to ask Congress for a declaration of war</span>
				<span class='text'>Meanwhile, Taylor crossed the Rio Grande and briefly occupied [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Taylor continued to blockade ships from entering the port of Matamoros</span>
				<span class='text'>Mere days before Polk intended to make his request to Congress, he received word that Mexican forces had crossed the Rio Grande area and killed eleven American soldiers</span>
				<span class='text'>Polk then made this the ''[[casus belli]]'', and in a message to Congress on May 11, 1846, he stated that Mexico had &quot;invaded our territory and shed American blood upon the American soil</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;Some Whigs, such as [[Abraham Lincoln]], challenged Polk's version of events,&lt;ref&gt;Mark E</span>

				<span class='text'>Polk,&quot; ''Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society,'' Sept 1981, Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>74 Issue 3, pp 199–216&lt;/ref&gt; but Congress overwhelmingly approved the declaration of war</span>
				<span class='text'>Many Whigs feared that opposition would cost them politically by casting themselves as unpatriotic for not supporting the war effort</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;In January 1848, the Whigs won a House vote attacking Polk in an amendment to a resolution praising Major General Taylor for his service in a &quot;war unnecessarily and unconstitutionally begun by the President of the United States&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>[http://memory</span>
				<span class='text'>oc</span>
				<span class='text'>ov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(hj04321)) House Journal, 30th Session (1848) pp</span>
				<span class='text'>83–184] The resolution, however, died in committee</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In the House, antislavery Whigs led by [[John Quincy Adams]] voted against the war; among Democrats, Senator [[John C</span>
				<span class='text'>Calhoun]] was the most notable opponent of the declaration</span>
				<span class='text'>===Military action====Polk selected the top generals and set the military strategy of the war</span>
				<span class='text'>By the summer of 1846, American forces under General [[Stephen W</span>
				<span class='text'>Kearny]] had captured New Mexico</span>
				<span class='text'>Meanwhile, Army captain [[John C</span>
				<span class='text'>Frémont]] led settlers in northern California to overthrow the Mexican garrison in Sonoma (in the [[California Republic|Bear Flag Revolt]])</span>
				<span class='text'>General Zachary Taylor, at the same time, was having success on the Rio Grande, although Polk did not reinforce his troops there</span>
				<span class='text'>The United States also negotiated a secret arrangement with [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]], the Mexican general and dictator who had been overthrown in 1844</span>
				<span class='text'>Santa Anna agreed that, if given safe passage into Mexico, he would attempt to persuade those in power to sell California and New Mexico to the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>Once he reached Mexico, however, he reneged on his agreement, declared himself President, and tried to drive the American invaders back</span>
				<span class='text'>Santa Anna's efforts, however, were in vain, as Generals Taylor and [[Winfield Scott]] destroyed all resistance</span>
				<span class='text'>Scott captured Mexico City in September 1847, and Taylor won a series of victories in northern Mexico</span>
				<span class='text'>Even after these battles, Mexico did not surrender until 1848, when it agreed to peace terms set out by Polk</span>
				<span class='text'>===Peace: the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo====[[File:Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo</span>
				<span class='text'>ng|frame||The [[Mexican Cession]] (in red) was acquired through the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Gadsden Purchase]] (in orange) was acquired through purchase after Polk left office</span>
				<span class='text'>]Polk sent diplomat [[Nicholas Trist]] to negotiate with the Mexicans</span>
				<span class='text'>Lack of progress prompted the President to order Trist to return to the United States, but the diplomat ignored the instructions and stayed in Mexico to continue bargaining</span>
				<span class='text'>Trist successfully negotiated the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] in 1848, which Polk agreed to ratify, ignoring calls from Democrats who demanded that all Mexico be annexed</span>
				<span class='text'>The treaty added 1</span>
				<span class='text'>&amp;nbsp;million square miles (3</span>
				<span class='text'>&amp;nbsp;million square kilometers) of territory to the United States; Mexico's size was halved, while that of the United States increased by a third</span>
				<span class='text'>[[California]], [[Nevada]], [[Utah]], most of [[Arizona]], and parts of [[New Mexico]], [[Colorado]] and [[Wyoming]] were all included in the Mexican Cession</span>
				<span class='text'>The treaty also recognized the annexation of Texas and acknowledged American control over the disputed territory between the [[Nueces River]] and the Rio Grande</span>
				<span class='text'>Mexico, in turn, received $15&amp;nbsp;million</span>
				<span class='text'>The war claimed fewer than 20,000 American lives but over 50,000 Mexican ones</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Smith II, 51–8 &quot;about 12,850&quot; deaths out of 90,000 American troops</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; It may have cost the United States $100&amp;nbsp;million</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Rough estimate of total cost, Smith, II 266–7; this includes the payments to Mexico in exchange for the ceded territories</span>
				<span class='text'>The excess military appropriations during the war itself were $63,605,621</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the [[Wilmot Proviso]] injected the issue of slavery in the new territories, even though Polk had insisted to Congress and in his diary that this had never been a war goal</span>
				<span class='text'>he treaty, however, needed ratification by the Senate</span>
				<span class='text'>In March 1848, the Whigs, who had been so opposed to Polk's policy, suddenly changed position</span>
				<span class='text'>Two-thirds of the Whigs voted for Polk's treaty</span>
				<span class='text'>This ended the war and legalized the acquisition of the territories</span>
				<span class='text'>he war had serious consequences for Polk and the Democrats</span>
				<span class='text'>It gave the Whig Party a unifying message of denouncing the war as an immoral act of aggression carried out through abuse of power by the president</span>
				<span class='text'>In the 1848 election, however, the Whigs nominated General [[Zachary Taylor]], a war hero, and celebrated his victories</span>
				<span class='text'>Taylor refused to criticize Polk</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result of the strain of managing the war effort directly and in close detail, Polk's health markedly declined toward the end of his presidency</span>
				<span class='text'>==Cuba===In mid-1848, President Polk authorized his ambassador to Spain, [[Romulus Mitchell Saunders]], to negotiate the purchase of [[Cuba]] and offer [[Spain]] up to $100&amp;nbsp;million, an astounding sum at the time for one territory, equal to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|100000000|1848}}}} in present-day terms</span>
				<span class='text'>{inflation-fn|US}} Cuba was close to the United States and had slavery, so the idea appealed to Southerners but was unwelcome in the North</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Spain was still making huge profits in Cuba (notably in sugar, molasses, rum, and tobacco), and thus the Spanish government rejected Saunders' overtures</span>

				<span class='text'>This was the first new cabinet position created since the early days of the Republic</span>
				<span class='text'>Polk had misgivings about the federal government usurping power over public lands from the states; however, the delivery of the legislation on his last full day in office gave him no time to find constitutional grounds for a veto, or to draft a sufficient veto message, so Polk signed the bill</span>

				<span class='text'>Polk, of Tennessee? ''After that'', who is safe?&quot; The Republican historians of the nineteenth century inherited this view</span>
				<span class='text'>Polk was a compromise between the Democrats of the North, like [[David Wilmot]] and [[Silas Wright]], and the plantation owners who were led by [[John C</span>
				<span class='text'>Calhoun]]; the northern Democrats thought that when they did not get their way, it was because he was the tool of the slaveholders, and the conservatives of the South insisted that he was the tool of the northern Democrats</span>
				<span class='text'>These views were long reflected in the historical literature, until [[Arthur M</span>
				<span class='text'>Schlesinger, Jr]] and [[Bernard De Voto]] argued that Polk was nobody's tool, but set his own goals and achieved them</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>39–455; quote from Corwin (who became a Republican) on p</span>
				<span class='text'>439&lt;/ref&gt;Polk is now recognized, not only as the strongest president between Jackson and Lincoln, but the president who made the United States a coast-to-coast nation</span>
				<span class='text'>When historians began ranking the presidents in 1948, Polk ranked 10th in [[Arthur M</span>
				<span class='text'>Schlesinger]]'s poll</span>
				<span class='text'>and has subsequently ranked 8th in Schlesinger's 1962 poll, 11th in the Riders-McIver Poll (1996), 11th in the most recent Siena Poll (2002), 9th in the most recent ''Wall Street Journal'' Poll (2005), and 12th in the latest C-Span Poll (2009)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[Ranking presidents|Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States]]&lt;/ref&gt;Polk biographers over the years have sized up the magnitude of Polk's achievements and his legacy, particularly his two most recent</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;There are three key reasons why James K</span>
				<span class='text'>Polk deserves recognition as a significant and influential American president,&quot; Walter Borneman wrote</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;First, Polk accomplished the objectives of his presidential term as he defined them; second, he was the most decisive chief executive before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]; and third, he greatly expanded the executive power of the presidency, particularly its war powers, its role as commander-in-chief, and its oversight of the executive branch</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Borneman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>353</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; President [[Harry S</span>
				<span class='text'>Truman]] summarized this view by saying that Polk was &quot;a great president</span>
				<span class='text'>Said what he intended to do and did it</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Truman, Harry S</span>
				<span class='text'> and Robert H</span>

				<span class='text'>Truman'', Letter to Dean Acheson (unsent), August 26, 1960 (University of Missouri Press, 1997), p</span>
				<span class='text'>390</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;While Polk's legacy thus takes many forms, the most outstanding is the map of the continental United States, whose landmass he increased by a third</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;To look at that map,&quot; Robert Merry concluded, &quot;and to take in the western and southwestern expanse included in it, is to see the magnitude of Polk's presidential accomplishments</span>

				<span class='text'>He believed in &quot;[[Manifest Destiny]]&quot; even more than most did</span>
				<span class='text'>Referencing the Mexican-American War, General [[Ulysses S</span>
				<span class='text'>Grant]] stated that &quot;I was bitterly opposed to the [Texas annexation], and to this day regard the war, which resulted, as one of the most unjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation</span>
				<span class='text'>It was an instance of a republic following the bad example of European monarchies, in not considering justice in their desire to acquire additional territory</span>
