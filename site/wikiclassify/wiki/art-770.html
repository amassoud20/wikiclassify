				<span class='text'>He had come to learn this concept of conditioned reflex when examining the rates of salivations among dogs</span>
				<span class='text'>Pavlov had learned that when a buzzer or metronome was sounded in subsequent time with food being presented to the dog in consecutive sequences, the dog would initially salivate when the food was presented</span>
				<span class='text'>The dog would later come to associate the sound with the presentation of the food and salivate upon the presentation of that stimulus</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Pavlov's research on conditional reflexes greatly influenced not only science, but also popular culture</span>
				<span class='text'>Pavlovian conditioning was a major theme in [[Aldous Huxley]]'s [[dystopian]] novel, ''[[Brave New World]]'', and also to a large degree in [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>t is popularly believed that Pavlov always signaled the occurrence of food by ringing a bell</span>
				<span class='text'>However, his writings record the use of a wide variety of stimuli, including electric shocks, [[whistle]]s, [[metronome]]s, [[tuning fork]]s, and a range of visual stimuli, in addition to the ring of a bell</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1994, Catania cast doubt on whether Pavlov ever actually used a bell in his famous experiments</span>

				<span class='text'>Charles (1994); ''Query: Did Pavlov's Research Ring a Bell?'', Psycoloquy Newsletter, Tuesday, 7 June 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Littman tentatively attributed the popular imagery to Pavlov’s contemporaries [[Vladimir Bekhterev|Vladimir Mikhailovich Bekhterev]] and [[John B</span>
