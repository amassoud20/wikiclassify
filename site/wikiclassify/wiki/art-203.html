				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|upright|Lessing, 1771]]Lessing was born in [[Kamenz]], a small town in [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]], to Johann Gottfried Lessing and Justine Salome Feller</span>
				<span class='text'>His father was a Lutheran minister and wrote on theology</span>
				<span class='text'>Young Lessing studied at the Latin School in Kamenz from 1737 to 1741</span>
				<span class='text'>With a father who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps, Lessing next attended the [[Federal School of Saxony - Saint Afra|Fürstenschule St</span>
				<span class='text'>Afra]] monastery in [[Meissen]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After completing at St</span>
				<span class='text'>Afra's, he enrolled at the University of [[Leipzig]] where he pursued a degree in theology, medicine, philosophy, and philology (1746–1748)</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;It was here that his relationship with [[Friederike Caroline Neuber|Karoline Neuber]], a famous German actress, began</span>
				<span class='text'>He translated several French plays for her, and his interest in theatre grew</span>
				<span class='text'>During this time, he wrote his first play, ''The Young Scholar</span>
				<span class='text'>' Neuber eventually produced the play in 1748</span>
				<span class='text'>rom 1748 to 1760, Lessing lived in Leipzig and [[Berlin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He began to work as a reviewer and editor for the ''[[Vossische Zeitung]]'' and other periodicals</span>
				<span class='text'>Lessing formed a close connection with his cousin, Christlob Mylius, and decided to follow him to Berlin</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1750, Lessing and Mylius teamed together to begin a periodical publication named ''Beitrage zur Historie und Aufnahme des Theatres''</span>
				<span class='text'>The publication ran only four issues, but it caught the public's eye and revealed Lessing to be a serious critic and theorist of drama</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1752 he took his master's degree in [[University of Wittenberg|Wittenberg]]</span>
				<span class='text'>From 1760 to 1765, he worked in [[Breslau]] (now Wrocław) as secretary to [[Friedrich Bogislav von Tauentzien|General Tauentzien]] during the [[Seven Years' War]] between Britain and France, which had effects in Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>It was during this time that he wrote his famous ''Laokoon, or the Limitations of Poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>'In 1765 Lessing returned to Berlin, leaving in 1767 to work for three years at the [[Hamburg National Theatre]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Actor-manager, Konrad Ackermann, began construction on Germany's first permanent theatre in Hamburg</span>
				<span class='text'>Johann Friederich Lowen established Germany's first national theatre, the [[Hamburg National Theatre]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The owners hired Lessing as the theatre's critic of plays and acting, which would later be known as [[dramaturgy]] (based on his own words), making Lessing the very first [[dramaturge]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The theatre's main backer was [[Abel Seyler]], a former currency speculator who since became known as &quot;the leading patron of German theatre</span>

				<span class='text'>His work in Hamburg formed the basis of his pioneering work on drama, titled ''[[Hamburgische Dramaturgie]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Unfortunately, because of financial losses due to pirated editions of the ''[[Hamburgische Dramaturgie]]'', the Hamburg Theatre closed just three years later</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In 1770 Lessing became librarian at the ducal library, now the [[Herzog August Library]] (''Herzog-August-Bibliothek'', ''Bibliotheca Augusta''), in [[Wolfenbüttel]] under the commission of the Duke of Brunswick</span>
				<span class='text'>His tenure there was energetic, if interrupted by many journeys</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1775, for example, he accompanied Prince Leopold to Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>n 14 October 1771 Lessing was initiated into Freemasonry in the lodge &quot;Zu den drei Goldenen Rosen&quot; in Hamburg</span>

				<span class='text'>She died in 1778 after giving birth to a short-lived son</span>
				<span class='text'>On 15 February 1781, Lessing, aged 52, died during a visit to the wine dealer Angott in [[Braunschweig (city)|Brunswick]]</span>
				<span class='text'>essing was also famous for his friendship with Jewish-German philosopher [[Moses Mendelssohn]]</span>

				<span class='text'>He began publishing heated pamphlets on his beliefs which were eventually banned</span>
				<span class='text'>It was this banishment that inspired him to return to theatre to portray his views and wrote ''[[Nathan the Wise]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>=Works==Lessing was a poet, philosopher and critic</span>
				<span class='text'>His theoretical and critical writings are remarkable for their often witty and ironic style and their unerring polemics</span>
				<span class='text'>Hereby the stylistic device of dialogue met with his intention of looking at a thought from different angles and searching for elements of truth even in the arguments made by his opponents</span>
				<span class='text'>For him this truth was never solid or something which could be owned by someone but always a process of approaching</span>
				<span class='text'>arly in his life, Lessing showed interest in the theatre</span>
				<span class='text'>In his theoretical and critical writings on the subject—as in his own plays—he tried to contribute to the development of a new type of theatre in Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>With this he especially turned against the then predominant [[literary theory]] of [[Gottsched]] and his followers</span>
				<span class='text'>Lessing's ''[[Hamburgische Dramaturgie]]'' ran critiques of plays that were performed in the Hamburg Theatre, but after dealing with dissatisfied actors and actresses, Lessing redirected his writings to more of an analysis on the proper uses of drama</span>
				<span class='text'>Lessing advocated the outline of drama in Aristotle's ''Poetics''</span>
				<span class='text'>He believed The French Academy had devalued the uses of drama through their neoclassical rules of form and separation of genres</span>
				<span class='text'>His repeated opinions on this issue influenced theatre practitioners who began the movement of rejecting theatre rules known as [[Sturm und Drang]], or &quot;storm and stress&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>|Home, [[Wolfenbüttel]]]]In Hamburg he tried with others to set up the German National Theatre</span>
				<span class='text'>Today his own works appear as prototypes of the later developed bourgeois German drama</span>
				<span class='text'>Scholars see ''[[Miss Sara Sampson]]'' and ''[[Emilia Galotti]]'' as amongst the first [[bourgeois tragedy|bourgeois tragedies]], ''[[Minna von Barnhelm]]'' (Minna of Barnhelm) as the model for many classic German comedies, ''[[Nathan the Wise]]'' (''Nathan der Weise'') as the first German drama of ideas (&quot;Ideendrama&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>His theoretical writings ''Laocoon'' and ''Hamburg Dramaturgy'' (''Hamburgische Dramaturgie'') set the standards for the discussion of aesthetic and literary theoretical principles</span>
				<span class='text'>Lessing advocated that dramaturgs should carry their work out working directly with theatre companies rather than in isolation</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In his religious and philosophical writings he defended the faithful Christian's right for freedom of thought</span>
				<span class='text'>He argued against the belief in revelation and the holding on to a literal interpretation of the Bible by the predominant orthodox doctrine through a problem later to be called '''Lessing's Ditch'''</span>
				<span class='text'>Lessing outlined the concept of the religious &quot;Proof of Power&quot;: How can miracles continue to be used as a base for Christianity when we have no proof of miracles? Historical truths which are in doubt cannot be used to prove metaphysical truths (such as God's existence)</span>
				<span class='text'>As Lessing says it: &quot;That, then, is the ugly great ditch which I cannot cross, however often and however earnestly I have tried to make that leap</span>

				<span class='text'>Cambridge University Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;In the final leg of his life, Lessing threw himself into an intense evaluation of theology and religion</span>
				<span class='text'>He did much of his studying by reading manuscripts he found while working as a librarian</span>
				<span class='text'>While working for the Duke, he formed a close friendship with a family by the name of Reimarus</span>
				<span class='text'>The family held an unpublished manuscript that provided a complete attack on the historicity of Christian revelation</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite discouragement from his brother, Karl, Lessing began publishing pieces of the manuscript in pamphlets known as ''Fragments from an Unnamed Author''</span>
				<span class='text'>The controversial pamphlets resulted in a heated debate between him and another theologian, Johann Melchior Goeze</span>
				<span class='text'>In concern for tarnishing his reputation, Goeze requested the government put an end to the feud, and Lessing was silenced through a law that took away his freedom from censorship</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In response, Lessing relied upon his skills as a playwright to write what is undoubtedly his most influential play, ''Nathan the Wise''</span>
				<span class='text'>In the play, Lessing set up tension between Judaism, Islam, and Christianity by having one character ask Nathan which religion was the most genuine</span>
				<span class='text'>Nathan avoids the question by telling the parable of the three rings, which implies the idea that no specific religion is the &quot;correct religion</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The Enlightenment ideas to which Lessing held tight were portrayed through his &quot;ideal of humanity,&quot; stating that religion is relative to the individual's ability to reason</span>
				<span class='text'>''Nathan the Wise'' is considered to be the first example of the German &quot;literature of humanity&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>As a child of the Enlightenment he trusted in a &quot;Christianity of Reason&quot;, which oriented itself by the spirit of religion</span>
				<span class='text'>He believed that human reason (initiated by criticism and dissent) would develop, even without help by a divine revelation</span>
				<span class='text'>In his writing ''The Education of Humankind'' (''Die Erziehung des Menschengeschlechts'') he extensively and coherently lays out his position</span>
				<span class='text'>he idea of freedom (for the theatre against the dominance of its French model; for religion from the church's dogma) is his central theme throughout his life</span>
				<span class='text'>Therefore, he also stood up for the liberation of the upcoming middle and upper class from the nobility making up their minds for them</span>
				<span class='text'>n his own literary existence he also constantly strove for independence</span>
				<span class='text'>But his ideal of a possible life as a free author was hard to keep up against the economic constraints he faced</span>
				<span class='text'>His project of authors self-publishing their works, which he tried to accomplish in Hamburg with [[Johann Joachim Christoph Bode|C</span>
				<span class='text'>J</span>
				<span class='text'>Bode]], failed</span>
				<span class='text'>essing is important as a [[literary critic]] for his work ''[[Laocoon]]: An Essay on the Limits of Painting and Poetry''</span>
				<span class='text'>In this work, he argues against the tendency to take [[Horace]]'s ''ut pictura poesis'' (as painting, so poetry) as prescriptive for literature</span>
				<span class='text'>In other words, he objected to trying to write poetry using the same devices as one would in painting</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, poetry and painting each has its character (the former is extended in time; the latter is extended in space)</span>
				<span class='text'>This is related to Lessing's turn from French [[classicism]] to Aristotelian [[mimesis]], discussed above</span>
