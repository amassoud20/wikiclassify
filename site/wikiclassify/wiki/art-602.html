				<span class='text'>The first five-book collection of the ''[[Amores (Ovid)|Amores]]'', a series of erotic poems addressed to a lover, Corinna, is thought to have been published in 16‚Äì15 BC; the surviving version, redacted to three books according to an epigram prefixed to the first book, is thought to have been published c</span>

				<span class='text'>vid's next poem, the ''Medicamina Faciei'', a fragmentary work on women's beauty treatments, preceded the ''[[Ars Amatoria]]'', the ''Art of Love'', a parody of [[didactic poetry]] and a three-book manual about seduction and intrigue, which has been dated to AD 2 (Books 1‚Äì2 would go back to 1 BC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hornblower | first = Simon | authorlink = |author2=Antony Spawforth | title = Oxford Classical Dictionary | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1996 | location = | page = 1085 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;)</span>
				<span class='text'>Ovid may identify this work in his exile poetry as the ''carmen'', or song, which was one cause of his banishment</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''Ars Amatoria'' was followed by the ''Remedia Amoris'' in the same year</span>
				<span class='text'>This corpus of elegiac, erotic poetry earned Ovid a place among the chief Roman elegists Gallus, Tibullus, and Propertius, of whom he saw himself as the fourth member</span>

				<span class='text'>At the same time, he worked on the ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'', a six-book poem in elegiac couplets on the theme of the calendar of [[Roman festivals]] and astronomy</span>
				<span class='text'>The composition of this poem was interrupted by Ovid's exile,{{Ref label|c|c|none}} and it is thought that Ovid abandoned work on the piece in Tomis</span>
				<span class='text'>It is probably in this period, if they are indeed by Ovid, that the double letters (16‚Äì21) in the ''Heroides'' were composed</span>

				<span class='text'>2&lt;/ref&gt;The Emperor's grandchildren, [[Julia the Younger]] and [[Agrippa Postumus]] (the latter adopted by him), were also banished around the same time</span>

				<span class='text'>158&lt;/ref&gt;The [[Lex Julia|Julian Marriage Laws of 18 BC]], which promoted [[monogamy|monogamous]] marriage to increase the population's birth rate, were fresh in the Roman mind</span>
				<span class='text'>Ovid's writing in the ''Ars Amatoria'' concerned the serious crime of [[adultery]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He may have been banished for these works, which appeared subversive to the emperor's moral legislation</span>
				<span class='text'>However, in view of the long time that elapsed between the publication of this work (1 BC) and the exile (AD 8), some authors suggest that [[Augustus]] used the poem as a mere justification for something more personal</span>

				<span class='text'>]In exile, Ovid wrote two poetry collections, ''[[Tristia]]'' and ''[[Epistulae ex Ponto]]'', that illustrated his sadness and desolation</span>
				<span class='text'>Being far from Rome, he had no access to libraries, and thus might have been forced to abandon the ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'' poem about the Roman calendar, of which only the first six books exist ‚Äì January through June</span>
				<span class='text'>he five books of the elegiac ''Tristia'', a series of poems expressing the poet's despair in exile and advocating his return to Rome, are dated to AD 9‚Äì12</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''Ibis'', an elegiac curse poem attacking an adversary at home, may also be dated to this period</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''[[Epistulae ex Ponto]]'', a series of letters to friends in Rome asking them to effect his return, are thought to be his last compositions, with the first three books published in AD 13 and the fourth book between AD 14 and 16</span>
				<span class='text'>The exile poetry is particularly emotive and personal</span>
				<span class='text'>In the ''Epistulae'' he claims friendship with the natives of Tomis (in the ''Tristia'' they are frightening barbarians) and to have written a poem in their language (''Ex P''</span>

				<span class='text'>3</span>
				<span class='text'>9‚Äì20)</span>
				<span class='text'>et he pined for Rome‚Äîand for his third wife, addressing many poems to her</span>
				<span class='text'>Some are also to the Emperor Augustus, yet others are to himself, to friends in Rome, and sometimes to the poems themselves, expressing loneliness and hope of recall from banishment or exile</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;The first two lines of the ''Tristia'' communicate his misery:''Parve ‚Äì nec invideo ‚Äì sine me, liber, ibis in urbem; ei mihi, quod domino non licet ire tuo!'':''Little book ‚Äì for I don't begrudge it ‚Äì go on to the city without me; Alas for me, because your master is not allowed to go with you!''&lt;/ref&gt;The obscure causes of Ovid's exile have given rise to endless explanations from scholars</span>
				<span class='text'>The medieval texts that mention the exile offer no credible explanations: their statements seem incorrect interpretations drawn from the works of Ovid</span>

				<span class='text'>Elegy originates with Propertius and Tibullus; however, Ovid is an innovator in the genre</span>
				<span class='text'>Ovid changes the leader of his elegies from the poet, to Amor (love)</span>
				<span class='text'>This switch in focus from the triumphs of the poet, to the triumphs of love over people is the first of its kind for this genre of poetry</span>

				<span class='text'>ook 1 contains 15 poems</span>
				<span class='text'>The first tells of Ovid's intention to write epic poetry, which is thwarted when [[Cupid]] steals a metrical foot from him, changing his work into love elegy</span>
				<span class='text'>oem 4 is didactic and describes principles that Ovid would develop in the ''[[Ars Amatoria]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>Poem 14 discusses Corinna's disastrous experiment in dyeing her hair and 15 stresses the immortality of Ovid and love poets</span>
				<span class='text'>he second book has 19 pieces; the opening poem tells of Ovid's abandonment of a [[Gigantomachy]] in favor of [[elegy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Poems 2 and 3 are entreaties to a guardian to let the poet see Corinna, poem 6 is a lament for Corinna's dead parrot; poems 7 and 8 deal with Ovid's affair with Corinna's servant and her discovery of it, and 11 and 12 try to prevent Corinna from going on vacation</span>
				<span class='text'>Poem 13 is a prayer to [[Isis]] for Corinna's illness, 14 a poem against abortion, and 19 a warning to unwary husbands</span>
				<span class='text'>ook 3 has 15 poems</span>

				<span class='text'>Ovid advises men to avoid giving too many gifts, keep up their appearance, hide affairs, compliment their lovers, and ingratiate themselves with slaves to stay on their lover's good side</span>
				<span class='text'>The care of Venus for procreation is described as is Apollo's aid in keeping a lover; Ovid then digresses on the story of [[Hephaestus#Hephaestus and Aphrodite|Vulcan's trap for Venus and Mars]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The book ends with Ovid asking his &quot;students&quot; to spread his fame</span>
				<span class='text'>Book 3 opens with a vindication of women's abilities and Ovid's resolution to arm women against his teaching in the first two books</span>
				<span class='text'>Ovid gives women detailed instructions on appearance telling them to avoid too many adornments</span>
				<span class='text'>He advises women to read elegiac poetry, learn to play games, sleep with people of different ages, flirt, and dissemble</span>
				<span class='text'>Throughout the book, Ovid playfully interjects, criticizing himself for undoing all his didactic work to men and mythologically digresses on the story of [[Procris#Ovid|Procris]] and [[Cephalus#Husband of Procris|Cephalus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The book ends with his wish that women will follow his advice and spread his fame saying ''Naso magister erat,'' &quot;Ovid was our teacher&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>==''Remedia Amoris'' (&quot;The Cure for Love&quot;)==={{Main| Remedia Amoris}}This elegiac poem proposes a cure for the love Ovid teaches in the ''Ars Amatoria'', and is primarily addressed to men</span>
				<span class='text'>The poem criticizes suicide as a means for escaping love and, invoking Apollo, goes on to tell lovers not to procrastinate and be lazy in dealing with love</span>
				<span class='text'>Lovers are taught to avoid their partners, not perform magic, see their lover unprepared, take other lovers, and never be jealous</span>
				<span class='text'>Old letters should be burned and the lover's family avoided</span>
				<span class='text'>The poem throughout presents Ovid as a doctor and utilizes medical imagery</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|200px|right|Engraved frontispiece of [[George Sandys]]‚Äôs 1632 London edition of ''Ovid's Metamorphoses Englished''</span>
				<span class='text'>]{{Main| Metamorphoses}}The ''Metamorphoses'', Ovid's most ambitious and popular work, consists of a 15-book catalogue written in [[dactylic hexameter]] about transformations in Greek and Roman mythology set within a loose mytho-historical framework</span>
				<span class='text'>Within an extent of nearly 12,000 verses, almost 250 different myths are mentioned</span>
				<span class='text'>Each myth is set outdoors where the mortals are often vulnerable to external influences</span>
				<span class='text'> The poem stands in the tradition of mythological and aetiological catalogue poetry such as [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Catalogue of Women]]'', [[Callimachus]]' ''Aetia'', [[Nicander]]'s ''Heteroeumena'', and [[Parthenius of Nicaea|Parthenius]]' ''Metamorphoses''</span>
				<span class='text'>he first book describes the formation of the world, the [[ages of man]], the [[Flood myth|flood]], the story of [[Daphne]]'s rape by Apollo and [[Io (mythology)|Io]]'s by Jupiter</span>
				<span class='text'>The second book opens with [[Phaethon#Ovid|Phaethon]] and continues describing the love of Jupiter with [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]] and [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The third book focuses on the mythology of [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]] with the stories of [[Cadmus]], [[Actaeon]], and [[Pentheus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The fourth book focuses on three pairs of lovers: [[Pyramus]] and [[Thisbe]], [[Salmacis]] and [[Hermaphroditus]], and [[Perseus]] and [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The fifth book focuses on the song of the [[Muses]], which describes the rape of [[Proserpina]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The sixth book is a collection of stories about the rivalry between gods and mortals, beginning with [[Arachne]] and ending with [[Philomela (princess of Athens)|Philomela]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The seventh book focuses on [[Medea]], as well as [[Cephalus]] and [[Procris]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The eighth book focuses on [[Daedalus]]' flight, the [[Calydonian boar]] hunt, and the contrast between pious [[Baucis and Philemon]] and the wicked [[Erysichthon of Thessaly|Erysichthon]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The ninth book focuses on [[Heracles]] and the incestuous [[Byblis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The tenth book focuses on stories of doomed love, such as [[Orpheus]], who sings about [[Hyacinth (mythology)|Hyacinth]]us, as well as [[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]], [[Myrrha]], and [[Adonis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The eleventh book compares the marriage of [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]] with the love of [[Ceyx]] and [[Alcyone]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The twelfth book moves from myth to history describing the exploits of [[Achilles]], the [[Lapith#Centauromachy|battle of the centaurs]], and [[Iphigeneia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The thirteenth book discusses the [[Achilles#Fate of Achilles' armor|contest over Achilles' arms]], and [[Polyphemus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The fourteenth moves to Italy, describing the journey of [[Aeneas]], [[Pomona (mythology)|Pomona]] and [[Vertumnus]], and [[Romulus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The final book opens with a philosophical lecture by [[Pythagoras]] and the deification of [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The end of the poem praises [[Augustus]] and expresses Ovid's belief that his poem has earned him immortality</span>
				<span class='text'>n analyzing the ''Metamorphoses'', scholars have focused on Ovid's organization of his vast body of material</span>
				<span class='text'>The ways that stories are linked by geography, themes, or contrasts creates interesting effects and constantly forces the reader to evaluate the connections</span>
				<span class='text'>Ovid also varies his tone and material from different literary genres; [[Gian Biagio Conte|G</span>
				<span class='text'>B</span>
				<span class='text'>Conte]] has called the poem &quot;a sort of gallery of these various literary genres</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Conte, G</span>
				<span class='text'>pg</span>
				<span class='text'>52&lt;/ref&gt; In this spirit, Ovid engages creatively with his predecessors, alluding creatively to the full spectrum of classical poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>Ovid's use of Alexandrian epic, or elegiac couplets, shows his fusion of erotic and psychological style with traditional forms of epic</span>
				<span class='text'>==''Fasti'' (&quot;The Festivals&quot;)==={{Main| Fasti (poem)}}Six books in elegiacs survive of this second ambitious poem that Ovid was working on when he was exiled</span>
				<span class='text'>The six books cover the first semester of the year, with each book dedicated to a different month of the [[Roman calendar]] (January to June)</span>
				<span class='text'>The project seems unprecedented in Roman literature</span>
				<span class='text'>It seems that Ovid planned to cover the whole year, but was unable to finish because of his exile, although he did revise sections of the work at Tomis, and he claims at ''Trist</span>
				<span class='text'>' 2</span>
				<span class='text'>49‚Äì52 that his work was interrupted after six books</span>
				<span class='text'>Like the ''Metamorphoses'', the ''Fasti'' was to be a long poem and emulated aetiological poetry by writers like [[Callimachus]] and, more recently, [[Propertius]] and his fourth book</span>
				<span class='text'>The poem goes through the Roman calendar, explaining the origins and customs of important Roman festivals, digressing on mythical stories, and giving astronomical and agricultural information appropriate to the season</span>
				<span class='text'>The poem was probably dedicated to [[Augustus]] initially, but perhaps the death of the emperor prompted Ovid to change the dedication to honor [[Germanicus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Ovid uses direct inquiry of gods and scholarly research to talk about the calendar and regularly calls himself a ''[[vates]]'', a priest</span>
				<span class='text'>He also seems to emphasize unsavory, popular traditions of the festivals, imbuing the poem with a popular, [[plebeian]] flavor, which some have interpreted as subversive to the Augustan moral legislation</span>

				<span class='text'>26ff</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; While this poem has always been invaluable to students of Roman religion and culture for the wealth of antiquarian material it preserves, it recently has been seen as one of Ovid's finest literary works and a unique contribution to Roman elegiac poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>==''Ibis'' (&quot;The Ibis&quot;)==={{Main| Ibis (Ovid)}}The ''Ibis'' is an elegiac poem in 644 lines, in which Ovid uses a dazzling array of mythic stories to curse and attack an enemy who is harming him in exile</span>
				<span class='text'>At the beginning of the poem, Ovid claims that his poetry up to that point had been harmless, but now he is going to use his abilities to hurt his enemy</span>
				<span class='text'>He cites Callimachus' ''Ibis'' as his inspiration and calls all the gods to make his curse effective</span>
				<span class='text'>Ovid uses mythical exempla to condemn his enemy in the afterlife, cites evil prodigies that attended his birth, and then in the next 300 lines wishes that the torments of mythological characters befall his enemy</span>
				<span class='text'>The poem ends with a prayer that the gods make his curse effective</span>
				<span class='text'>==''Tristia'' (&quot;Sorrows&quot;)==={{Main| Tristia}}The ''Tristia'' consist of five books of elegiac poetry composed by Ovid in exile in Tomis</span>
				<span class='text'>ook 1 contains 11 poems; the first piece is an address by Ovid to his book about how it should act when it arrives in Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>Poem 3 describes his final night in Rome, poems 2 and 10 Ovid's voyage to Tomis, 8 the betrayal of a friend, and 5 and 6 the loyalty of his friends and wife</span>
				<span class='text'>In the final poem Ovid apologizes for the quality and tone of his book, a sentiment echoed throughout the collection</span>
				<span class='text'>ook 2 consists of one long poem in which Ovid defends himself and his poetry, uses precedents to justify his work, and begs the emperor for forgiveness</span>
				<span class='text'>ook 3 in 14 poems focuses on Ovid's life in Tomis</span>
				<span class='text'>The opening poem describes his book's arrival in Rome to find Ovid's works banned</span>
				<span class='text'>Poems 10, 12, and 13 focus on the seasons spent in Tomis, 9 on the origins of the place, and 2, 3, and 11 his emotional distress and longing for home</span>
				<span class='text'>The final poem is again an apology for his work</span>
				<span class='text'>he fourth book has ten poems addressed mostly to friends</span>
				<span class='text'>Poem 1 expresses his love of poetry and the solace it brings; while 2 describes a triumph of Tiberius</span>
				<span class='text'>Poems 3‚Äì5 are to friends, 7 a request for correspondence, and 10 an autobiography</span>
				<span class='text'>he final book of the ''Tristia'' with 14 poems focuses on his wife and friends</span>
				<span class='text'>Poems 4, 5, 11, and 14 are addressed to his wife, 2 and 3 are prayers to [[Augustus]] and [[Bacchus]], 4 and 6 are to friends, 8 to an enemy</span>
				<span class='text'>Poem 13 asks for letters, while 1 and 12 are apologies to his readers for the quality of his poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>==''Epistulae ex Ponto'' (&quot;Letters from the Black Sea&quot;)==={{Main| Epistulae ex Ponto}}The ''Epistulae ex Ponto'' is a collection in four books of further poetry from exile</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''Epistulae'' are each addressed to a different friend and focus more desperately than the ''Tristia'' on securing his recall from exile</span>
				<span class='text'>The poems mainly deal with requests for friends to speak on his behalf to members of the imperial family, discussions of writing with friends, and descriptions of life in exile</span>
				<span class='text'>The first book has ten pieces in which Ovid describes the state of his health (10), his hopes, memories, and yearning for Rome (3, 6, 8), and his needs in exile (3)</span>
				<span class='text'>Book 2 contains impassioned requests to Germanicus (1 and 5) and various friends to speak on his behalf at Rome while he describes his despair and life in exile</span>
				<span class='text'>Book 3 has nine poems in which Ovid addresses his wife (1) and various friends</span>
				<span class='text'>It includes a telling of the story of [[Iphigenia#Among the Taurians|Iphigenia in Tauris]] (2), a poem against criticism (9), and a dream of Cupid (3)</span>
				<span class='text'>Book 4, the final work of Ovid, in 16 poems talks to friends and describes his life as an exile further</span>
				<span class='text'>Poems 10 and 13 describe Winter and Spring at Tomis, poem 14 is halfhearted praise for Tomis, 7 describes its geography and climate, and 4 and 9 are congratulations on friends for their consulships and requests for help</span>
				<span class='text'>Poem 12 is addressed to a Tuticanus, whose name, Ovid complains, does not fit into meter</span>
				<span class='text'>The final poem is addressed to an enemy whom Ovid implores to leave him alone</span>
				<span class='text'>The last elegiac couplet is translated: &quot;Where‚Äôs the joy in stabbing your steel into my dead flesh?/ There‚Äôs no place left where I can be dealt fresh wounds</span>

				<span class='text'>In a monologue asking boys not pelt it with stones to get its fruit, the tree contrasts the formerly fruitful [[golden age]] with the present barren time, in which its fruit is violently ripped off and its branches broken</span>
				<span class='text'>In the course of this, the tree compares itself to several mythological characters, praises the peace that the emperor provides and prays to be destroyed rather than suffer</span>

				<span class='text'>The poet describes a dream to an interpreter, saying that he sees while escaping from the heat of noon a white heifer near a bull; when the heifer is pecked by a crow, it leaves the bull for a meadow with other bulls</span>
				<span class='text'>The interpreter interprets the dream as a love allegory; the bull represents the poet, the heifer a girl, and the crow an old woman</span>
				<span class='text'>The old woman spurs the girl to leave her lover and find someone else</span>
				<span class='text'>The poem is known to have circulated independently and its lack of engagement with Tibullan or Propertian elegy argue in favor of its spuriousness; however, the poem does seem to be datable to the early empire</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; However, although [[Catullus]], [[Tibullus]] and [[Propertius]] may have been inspired in part by personal experience, the validity of &quot;biographical&quot; readings of these poets' works is a serious point of scholarly contention</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;In fact, it is generally accepted in most modern classical scholarship on elegy that the poems have little connection to autobiography or external reality</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; has led scholars to conclude that Corinna was never a real person‚Äîand that Ovid's relationship with her is an invention for his elegiac project</span>

				<span class='text'>''Ovid Amores 1'' (Oxford, 1973) pp</span>

				<span class='text'> Ovid has been traditionally seen as far more sexually explicit in his poetry than the other elegists</span>

				<span class='text'>5&lt;/ref&gt;His erotic elegy covers a wide spectrum of themes and viewpoints; the ''Amores'' focus on Ovid's relationship with Corinna, the love of [[List of Greek mythological figures|mythical characters]] is the subject of the ''Heroides'', and the ''[[Ars Amatoria]]'' and the other didactic love poems provide a handbook for relationships and seduction from a (mock-)&quot;scientific&quot; viewpoint</span>
				<span class='text'>In his treatment of elegy, scholars have traced the influence of rhetorical education in his [[enumeration]], in his effects of surprise, and in his transitional devices</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Some commentators have also noted the influence of Ovid's interest in love elegy in his other works, such as the ''Fasti,'' and have distinguished his &quot;elegiac&quot; style from his &quot;epic&quot; style</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Richard Heinze]] in his famous ''Ovids elegische Erz√§hlung'' (1919) delineated the distinction between Ovid's styles by comparing the ''[[Fasti]]'' and ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' versions of the same legends, such as the treatment of the [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]]‚Äì[[Proserpina]] story in both poems</span>
				<span class='text'>Heinze demonstrated that, &quot;whereas in the elegiac poems a sentimental and tender tone prevails, the hexameter narrative is characterized by an emphasis on solemnity and awe</span>
