				<span class='text'>Later, he also referred to himself as a &quot;phonometrician&quot; (meaning &quot;someone who measures sounds&quot;), preferring this designation to that of &quot;musician&quot;, after having been called &quot;a clumsy but subtle technician&quot; in a book on contemporary French composers published in 1911</span>

				<span class='text'>Although in later life he prided himself on publishing his work under his own name, in the late 19th century he appears to have used pseudonyms such as '''{{Lang|fr|Virginie Lebeau}}''' and '''{{Lang|fr|François de Paule}}''' in some of his published writings</span>
				<span class='text'>=Early life and training==[[File:MaisonSatie</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|200px|Satie house and museum in [[Honfleur]], Normandy]]Satie was the son of Alfred Satie and his wife Jane Leslie (née Anton), who was born in London to Scottish parents</span>
				<span class='text'>Erik was born at [[Honfleur]] in Normandy; his home there is open to the public</span>
				<span class='text'>When Satie was four years old, his family moved to Paris, his father having been offered a translator's job in the capital</span>
				<span class='text'>After his mother's death in 1872, he was sent (at age 6), together with his younger brother, Conrad, back to Honfleur to live with his paternal grandparents</span>
				<span class='text'>There he received his first music lessons from a local [[organist]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1878, when he was 12 years old, his grandmother died, and the two brothers were reunited in Paris with their father, who remarried (a piano teacher) shortly afterwards</span>
				<span class='text'>From the early 1880s onwards, Satie started publishing salon compositions by his step-mother and himself, among others</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1879, Satie entered the [[Conservatoire de Paris|Paris Conservatoire]], where he was soon labelled untalented by his teachers</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Georges Mathias]], his professor of piano at the Conservatoire, described his pupil's piano technique in flatly negative terms, &quot;insignificant and laborious&quot; and &quot;worthless&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>After being sent home for two and a half years, he was readmitted to the Conservatoire at the end of 1885 (age 19), but was unable to make a much more favourable impression on his teachers than he had before, and, as a result, resolved to take up [[military service]] a year later</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Satie's military career did not last very long; within a few months he was discharged after deliberately infecting himself with bronchitis</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Career=====Montmartre===[[File:Satie</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|A caricature of Eric Satie by [[Santiago Rusiñol]], 1891]]Satie moved from his father's residence to lodgings in [[Montmartre]] in 1887</span>
				<span class='text'>By this time he had started what was to be an enduring friendship with the romantic poet Patrice Contamine, and had his first compositions published by his father</span>
				<span class='text'>He soon integrated with the artistic clientele of the [[Le Chat Noir]] Café-cabaret, and started publishing his ''[[Gymnopédies]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Publication of compositions in the same vein (''{{Lang|fr|[[Ogives]]}}'', ''{{Lang|fr|[[Gnossiennes]]}}'', etc</span>
				<span class='text'> followed</span>
				<span class='text'>In the same period he befriended [[Claude Debussy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He moved to a smaller room, still in Montmartre ({{Lang|fr|rue Cortot Nº 6}}, now [[Musée-Placard d'Erik Satie|a museum]]), in 1890</span>
				<span class='text'>By 1891 he was the official composer and chapel-master of the [[Rosicrucian Order]] &quot;{{Lang|fr|Ordre de la Rose-Croix Catholique, du Temple et du Graal}}&quot;, led by {{Lang|fr|Sâr [[Joséphin Péladan]]}}, which led to compositions such as ''{{Lang|fr|Salut drapeau!}}'', ''{{Lang|fr|Le fils des étoiles}}'', and the ''{{Lang|fr|[[Sonneries de la Rose Croix|Sonneries de la Rose+Croix]]}}''</span>
				<span class='text'>Satie gave performances at the [[Salon de la Rose + Croix]], organized by Péladan</span>
				<span class='text'>y mid-1892, Satie had composed the first pieces in a compositional system of his own making (''{{Lang|fr|Fête donnée par des Chevaliers Normands en l'honneur d'une jeune demoiselle}}''), had provided incidental music to a [[chivalric]] [[esoteric]] play (two ''{{Lang|fr|Prélude du Nazaréen}}''), had had his first [[hoax]] published (announcing the [[premiere]] of ''{{Lang|fr|Le bâtard de Tristan}}'', an anti-Wagnerian opera he probably never composed), and had broken with Péladan, starting that autumn with the ''Uspud'' project, a &quot;Christian Ballet&quot;, in collaboration with {{Lang|fr|Contamine de Latour}}</span>
				<span class='text'>While the comrades from both the {{Lang|fr|Chat Noir}} and {{Lang|fr|Miguel Utrillo's Auberge du Clou}} sympathised, a promotional brochure was produced for the project, which reads as a [[pamphlet]] for a new esoteric [[sect]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1893, Satie met the young [[Maurice Ravel]] for the first time, Satie's style emerging in the first compositions of the youngster</span>
				<span class='text'>One of Satie's own compositions of that period, ''[[Vexations]]'', was to remain undisclosed until after his death</span>
				<span class='text'>By the end of the year he had founded the {{Lang|fr|[[Église Métropolitaine d'Art de Jésus Conducteur]]}} (Metropolitan Art Church of Jesus the Conductor)</span>
				<span class='text'>As its only member, in the role of &quot;Parcier et Maître de Chapelle&quot;, he started to compose a ''{{Lang|fr|Grande messe}}'' (later to become known as the ''[[Messe des pauvres]]''), and wrote a flood of letters, articles and pamphlets showing off his self-assuredness in religious and artistic matters</span>
				<span class='text'>To give an example: he applied for membership in the [[Académie Française]] twice, leaving no doubt in the application letter that the board of that organisation (presided over by [[Camille Saint-Saëns]]) as much as owed him such membership</span>
				<span class='text'>Such proceedings without doubt rather helped to wreck his popularity in the cultural [[The Establishment|establishment]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1895 he inherited some money, allowing him to have more of his writings printed, and to change from wearing a priest-like habit to being the &quot;Velvet Gentleman&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>==Move to Arcueil===[[File:El bohemi by Ramon Casas</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|''Satie, Moulin de la Galette (The bohemian)'', [[Ramon Casas i Carbó]], (1891)]]By mid-1896, all of Satie's financial means had vanished, and he had to move to cheaper and much smaller lodgings, first at the {{Lang|fr|Rue Cortot}},&lt;ref&gt;{{openplaque|3265}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two years later, after he had composed the two first sets of ''{{Lang|fr|[[Pièces froides]]}}'' in 1897, to [[Arcueil]], a suburb some five kilometres from the centre of Paris</span>
				<span class='text'>During this period he re-established contact with his brother Conrad for numerous practical and financial matters, disclosing some of his inner feelings in the process</span>
				<span class='text'>The letters to Conrad made it clear that he had set aside his religious ideas</span>
				<span class='text'>rom 1899 on, Satie started making money as a cabaret pianist, adapting over a hundred compositions of popular music for piano or piano and voice, adding some of his own</span>
				<span class='text'>The most popular of these were ''{{Lang|fr|[[Je te veux]]}}'', text by Henry Pacory; ''{{Lang|fr|Tendrement}}'', text by Vincent Hyspa; ''{{Lang|fr|Poudre d'or}}'', a waltz; ''[[La Diva de l'Empire]]'', text by Dominique Bonnaud/Numa Blès; ''{{Lang|fr|Le Picadilly}}'', a march; ''{{Lang|fr|Légende californienne}}'', text by Contamine de Latour lost, but the music later reappears in ''{{Lang|fr|La belle excentrique}}''; and quite a few more, many of which have been lost</span>
				<span class='text'>In his later years, Satie would reject all his cabaret music as vile and against his nature,&lt;ref&gt;Erik Satie in a 17 January 1911 letter to his brother Conrad, quoted in Volta 1989 and in Gillmor 1992 (Chronology p</span>
				<span class='text'>xxix)&lt;/ref&gt; but for the time being, it was an income</span>
				<span class='text'>nly a few compositions that Satie took seriously remain from this period: ''[[Jack in the Box (Satie)|Jack in the Box]]'', music to a [[pantomime]] by [[Jules Depaquit]] (called a &quot;{{Lang|fr|clownerie}}&quot; by Satie); ''{{Lang|fr|Geneviève de Brabant}}'', a short comic opera on a serious theme, text by [[Contamine de Latour|Lord Cheminot]]; ''The Dreamy Fish'', piano music to accompany a lost tale by Lord Cheminot; and a few others that were mostly incomplete, hardly any of them staged, and none of them published at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>oth ''{{Lang|fr|Geneviève de Brabant}}'' and ''The Dreamy Fish'' have been analysed by Ornella Volta as containing elements of competition with [[Claude Debussy]], of which Debussy was probably not aware, Satie not making this music public</span>
				<span class='text'>Meanwhile, Debussy was having one of his first major successes with ''{{Lang|fr|[[Pelléas et Mélisande (opera)|Pelléas et Mélisande]]}}'' in 1902, leading a few years later to 'who-was-precursor-to-whom' debates between the two composers, in which Maurice Ravel would also get involved</span>
				<span class='text'>n October 1905, Satie enrolled in [[Vincent d'Indy]]'s [[Schola Cantorum de Paris]] to study classical [[counterpoint]] while still continuing his cabaret work</span>
				<span class='text'>Most of his friends were as dumbfounded as the professors at the Schola when they heard about his new plan to return to the classrooms, especially as d'Indy was an admiring pupil of [[Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns]], not particularly favoured by Satie</span>
				<span class='text'>Satie would follow these courses at the Schola, as a respected pupil, for more than five years, receiving a first (intermediate) diploma in 1908</span>
				<span class='text'>Some of his classroom counterpoint-exercises, such as the ''{{Lang|fr|Désespoir agréable}}'', were published after his death</span>
				<span class='text'>Another summary, of the period prior to the Schola, also appeared in 1911: the ''{{Lang|fr|Trois morceaux en forme de poire}}'', which was a kind of compilation of the best of what he had written up to 1903</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}Something that becomes clear through these published compilations is that Satie did not so much reject [[Romanticism]] and its exponents like [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], but that he rejected certain aspects of it</span>
				<span class='text'>From his first composition to his last, he rejected the idea of [[musical development]],{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} in the strict definition of this term: the intertwining of different themes in a development section of a [[sonata form]]</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, his contrapuntal and other works were very short; the &quot;new, modern&quot; [[Fugue]]s do not extend further than the exposition of the theme(s)</span>
				<span class='text'>Generally, he would say that he did not think it permitted that a composer take more time from his public than strictly necessary</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Also [[Melodrama]], in its historical meaning of the then popular romantic genre of &quot;spoken words to a background of music&quot;, was something Satie avoided</span>
				<span class='text'>His 1913 ''[[Le piège de Méduse]]'' could be seen as an absurdist spoof of that genre</span>
				<span class='text'>n the meantime, other changes had also taken place: Satie was a member of a radical socialist party (he later switched his membership to the [[Communist]] party in that area after December 1920),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Satie the Composer|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521350372|page=233|author=Robert Orledge|accessdate=22 August 2013|quote=As Satie's career progressed, he moved further and further towards the left</span>
				<span class='text'>As early as 1908 he was an active member of the Radical-Socialist Committee in Arcueil, and he joined the official Socialist Party on the day after the assassination of [[Jean Jaurès]] (31 July 1914), switching to the Communist Party after the Congress of Tours in December 1920</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt; and had socialised with the Arcueil community: amongst other things, he had been involved in the &quot;{{Lang|fr|Patronage laïque}}&quot; work for children</span>
				<span class='text'>He also changed his appearance to that of the 'bourgeois functionary' with bowler hat, umbrella, etc</span>
				<span class='text'>He channelled his medieval interests into a peculiar secret [[hobby]]: in a filing cabinet he maintained a collection of imaginary buildings, most of them described as being made out of some kind of metal, which he drew on little cards</span>
				<span class='text'>Occasionally, extending the game, he would publish anonymous small announcements in local journals, offering some of these buildings, e</span>

				<span class='text'>==Height of success and influence===[[File:Satie autoportret Projet Buste 1913</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|170px|right|Sketch for a [[bust (sculpture)|bust]] of himself, by Satie, 1913]]Starting in 1912, Satie's new humorous miniatures for piano became very successful, and he wrote and published many of these over the next few years (most of them premiered by the pianist [[Ricardo Viñes]])</span>
				<span class='text'>His habit of accompanying the scores of his compositions with all kinds of written remarks was now well established, so that a few years later he had to insist that these not be read out during performances&lt;!-- avoiding &quot;Melodrama&quot; genre! --&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote in the first edition of ''Heures séculaires et instantanées'', &quot;To whom it may concern: 'I forbid anyone to read the text aloud during the musical performance</span>
				<span class='text'>Ignorance of my instructions will incur my righteous indignation against the presumptuous culprit</span>
				<span class='text'>No exception will be allowed</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williamson|first=John|title=Words and music|publisher=Liverpool University Press|location=Liverpool|year=2005|isbn=9780853236191|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had mostly stopped using barlines by this time</span>
				<span class='text'>In some ways, these compositions were very reminiscent{{According to whom|date=June 2010}} of [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]]'s compositions from the final years of his life, grouped under the name [[Péchés de vieillesse]]</span>
				<span class='text'>owever, the acceleration in Satie's life did not come so much from the success of his new piano pieces; it was Ravel who inadvertently triggered the characteristics of Satie's remaining years and thus influenced the successive progressive artistic and cultural movements that rapidly manifested themselves in Paris over the following years</span>
				<span class='text'>Paris was seen as the artistic capital of the world, and the beginning of the new century appeared to have set many minds on fire</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} In 1910 the &quot;{{Lang|fr|Jeunes Ravêlites}}&quot;, a group of young musicians around Ravel, proclaimed their preference for Satie's earlier work from before the Schola period, reinforcing the idea that Satie had been a precursor of Debussy</span>
				<span class='text'>t first, Satie was pleased that at least some of his works were receiving public attention, but when he realised that this meant that his more recent work was overlooked or dismissed, he looked for other young artists who related better to his more recent ideas, so as to have better mutual support in creative activity</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, young artists such as [[Alexis Roland-Manuel|Roland-Manuel]], and later [[Georges Auric]], and [[Jean Cocteau]], started to receive more of his attention than the &quot;{{Lang|fr|Jeunes}}&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>s a result of his contact with Roland-Manuel, Satie again began publicising his thoughts, with far more irony than he had done before (amongst other things, the ''{{Lang|fr|Mémoires d'un amnésique}}'' and ''{{Lang|fr|Cahiers d'un mammifère}}'')</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;English translations of these pieces were published in ''A Mammal's Notebook'', see [[#Sources|Sources]] section below</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;With Jean Cocteau, whom he had first met in 1915, Satie started work on incidental music for a production of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', resulting in the ''[[Cinq grimaces pour Le songe d'une nuit d'été]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>From 1916, he and Cocteau worked on the ballet ''[[Parade (ballet)|Parade]]'', which was premiered in 1917 by [[Sergei Diaghilev]]'s [[Ballets Russes]], with sets and costumes by [[Pablo Picasso]], and choreography by [[Léonide Massine]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Through Picasso, Satie also became acquainted with other [[cubism|cubists]], such as [[Georges Braque]], with whom he would work on other, aborted, projects</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Erik Satie composer</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|250px|Erik Satie</span>
				<span class='text'>Portrait by Donald Sheridan</span>
				<span class='text'>]With [[Georges Auric]], [[Louis Durey]], [[Arthur Honegger]], and [[Germaine Tailleferre]] Satie formed the [[Les Six|Nouveaux jeunes]], shortly after writing ''Parade''</span>
				<span class='text'>Later, the group was joined by [[Francis Poulenc]] and [[Darius Milhaud]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In September 1918, Satie&amp;nbsp;– giving little or no explanation&amp;nbsp;– withdrew from the {{Lang|fr|Nouveaux jeunes}}</span>
				<span class='text'>Jean Cocteau gathered the six remaining members, forming the [[Les Six|Groupe des six]] (to which Satie would later have access, but later again would fall out with most of its members)</span>
				<span class='text'>rom 1919, Satie was in contact with [[Tristan Tzara]], the initiator of the [[Dada]] movement</span>
				<span class='text'>He became acquainted with other artists involved in the movement, such as [[Francis Picabia]] (later to become a [[surrealism|Surrealist]]), [[André Derain]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Jean Hugo]] and [[Man Ray]], among others</span>
				<span class='text'>On the day of his first meeting with Man Ray, the two fabricated the artist's first [[readymade]]: ''[[The Gift (sculpture)|The Gift]]'' (1921)</span>
				<span class='text'>Satie contributed writing to the Dadaist publication ''[[391 (magazine)|391]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>In the first months of 1922, he was surprised to find himself entangled in the argument between Tzara and [[André Breton]] about the true nature of avant-garde art, epitomised by the failure of the Congrès de Paris</span>
				<span class='text'>Satie originally sided with Tzara, but managed to maintain friendly relations with most players in both camps</span>
				<span class='text'>Meanwhile, an &quot;{{Lang|fr|Ecole d'Arcueil}}&quot; had formed around Satie, taking the name from the relatively remote district of Paris where Satie lived;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Keith, ''Sleeve Notes The Best of Erik Satie'', Naxos 8</span>
				<span class='text'>56688&lt;/ref&gt; it included young musicians such as [[Henri Sauguet]], [[Maxime Jacob]], [[Roger Désormière]] and Henri Cliquet-Pleyel</span>
				<span class='text'>atie's last compositions were two 1924 ballets</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[Mercure (ballet)|Mercure]]'' reunited him with Picasso and Massine for a mythological spoof produced by Count Étienne de Beaumont's Soirées de Paris; and he wrote the &quot;{{Lang|fr|instantaneist}}&quot; ballet (''{{Lang|fr|[[Relâche (ballet)|Relâche]]}}'') in collaboration with Picabia, for the {{Lang|fr|[[Ballets suédois]]}} of [[Rolf de Maré]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In a simultaneous project, Satie added music to the surrealist film ''{{Lang|fr|[[Entr'acte (film)|Entr'acte]]}}'' by [[René Clair]], which was given as an intermezzo for ''{{Lang|fr|Relâche}}''</span>
				<span class='text'>=Personal life==Satie and [[Suzanne Valadon]], an artists' model, artist and a long-time friend of Miguel Utrillo (and mother of [[Maurice Utrillo]]), began an affair early in 1893</span>
				<span class='text'>After their first night together, he proposed marriage</span>
				<span class='text'>The two did not marry, but Valadon moved to a room next to Satie's at the {{Lang|fr|Rue Cortot}}</span>
				<span class='text'>Satie became obsessed with her, calling her his ''{{Lang|fr|Biqui}}'', and writing impassioned notes about &quot;her whole being, lovely eyes, gentle hands, and tiny feet&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>During their relationship, Satie composed the ''[[Danses gothiques]]'' as a kind of prayer to restore peace of mind, and Valadon painted a portrait of Satie, which she gave to him</span>
				<span class='text'>After six months she moved away, leaving Satie broken-hearted</span>
				<span class='text'>Afterwards, he said that he was left with &quot;nothing but an icy loneliness that fills the head with emptiness and the heart with sadness&quot;</span>
