				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;auteur16&quot;/&gt;Cagney held a variety of jobs early in his life, giving all his earnings to his family: junior [[architect]], [[copy boy]] for ''[[The New York Sun]]'', book custodian at the [[New York Public Library]], [[bellhop]], [[technical drawing|draughtsman]], and night [[doorman]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;auteur15&quot;&gt;McGilligan, page 15&lt;/ref&gt; While Cagney was working for the New York Public Library, he met [[Playhouse Theatre (Seattle)|Florence James]], who helped him into an acting career</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;pg45&quot;&gt;James, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>45&lt;/ref&gt; Cagney believed in hard work, later stating, &quot;It was good for me</span>
				<span class='text'>I feel sorry for the kid who has too cushy a time of it</span>
				<span class='text'>Suddenly he has to come face-to-face with the realities of life without any mama or papa to do his thinking for him</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;auteur15&quot;/&gt;He started [[Tap dance|tap dancing]] as a boy (a skill that eventually contributed to his Academy Award) and was nicknamed &quot;Cellar-Door Cagney&quot; after his habit of dancing on slanted cellar doors</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;auteur15&quot;/&gt; He was a good [[street fighting|street fighter]], defending his older brother Harry, a medical student, when necessary</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Warren4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cagney, page 8&lt;/ref&gt; He engaged in amateur boxing, and was a runner-up for the [[New York State]] lightweight title</span>
				<span class='text'>His coaches encouraged him to turn professional, but his mother would not allow it</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Warren, pages 23–24&lt;/ref&gt; He also played semiprofessional baseball for a local team,&lt;ref name=&quot;auteur15&quot;/&gt; and entertained dreams of playing in the [[Major League Baseball|Major Leagues]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Warren22&quot;&gt;Warren, page 22&lt;/ref&gt;His introduction to films was unusual</span>
				<span class='text'>When visiting an aunt who lived in [[Brooklyn]] opposite [[Vitagraph Studios]], Cagney would climb over the fence to watch the filming of [[John Bunny]] movies</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;auteur15&quot;/&gt; He became involved in [[Community theatre|amateur dramatics]], starting as a scenery boy for a Chinese [[pantomime]] at [[Lenox Hill Neighborhood House]], one of the first [[Settlement movement|settlement houses]] in the nation, where his brother Harry performed and his soon-to-be friend, Florence James, directed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;pg45&quot;/&gt; He was initially content working behind the scenes and had no interest in performing</span>
				<span class='text'>One night, however, Harry became ill, and although Cagney was not an [[understudy]], his [[Eidetic memory|photographic memory]] of rehearsals enabled him to stand in for his brother without making a single mistake</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Warrens, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>45&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Florence James has the unique distinction of being the first director to put him on a stage</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;pg45&quot;/&gt; Afterward, he joined a number of companies as a performer in a variety of roles</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;auteur18&quot;&gt;McGilligan, page 18&lt;/ref&gt;==Career=====1919–30: Early career===While working at [[Wanamaker's]] Department Store in 1919, Cagney learned, from a colleague who had seen him dance, of a role in the upcoming production ''Every Sailor''</span>
				<span class='text'>A wartime play in which the chorus was made up of servicemen dressed as women, it was originally titled ''Every Woman''</span>
				<span class='text'>Cagney auditioned for the role of a chorus girl, despite considering it a waste of time; he only knew one [[Dance move|dance step]], the complicated [[Peabody (dance)|Peabody]], but he knew it perfectly</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Warren, page 36&quot;&gt;Warren, page 36&lt;/ref&gt; This was enough to convince the producers that he could dance, and he copied the other dancers' moves while waiting to go on</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Cagney27&quot;&gt;Cagney, page 27&lt;/ref&gt; He did not find it odd to play a woman, nor was he embarrassed</span>
				<span class='text'>He later recalled how he was able to shed his own natural shy persona when he stepped onto the stage: &quot;For there I am not myself</span>
				<span class='text'>I am not that fellow, Jim Cagney, at all</span>
				<span class='text'>I certainly lost all consciousness of him when I put on skirts, wig, paint, powder, feathers and spangles</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;auteur19&quot;&gt;McGilligan, page 19&lt;/ref&gt;Had Cagney's mother had her way, his stage career would have ended when he quit ''Every Sailor'' after two months; proud as she was of his performance, she preferred that he get an education</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Warren, page 37&lt;/ref&gt; Cagney appreciated the $35 a week he was paid, which he called &quot;a mountain of money for me in those worrisome days</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Warren, page 36&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cagney27&quot;/&gt; In deference to his mother's worries, he got employment as a [[Broker|brokerage house]] runner</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Cagney27&quot;/&gt; This did not stop him looking for more stage work, however, and he went on to successfully audition for a chorus part in the [[William B</span>
				<span class='text'>Friedlander]] musical ''Pitter Patter'',&lt;ref name=&quot;worldandi&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;auteur19&quot;/&gt; for which he earned $55 a week—he sent $40 to his mother each week</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Cagney28&quot;&gt;Cagney, page 28&lt;/ref&gt; So strong was his habit of holding down more than one job at a time, he also worked as a dresser for one of the leads, portered the casts' luggage, and understudied for the lead</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;auteur19&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cagney28&quot;/&gt; Among the chorus line performers was 16-year-old Frances Willard &quot;Billie&quot; Vernon, whom he married in 1922</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cagney, page 29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Warren, page 48&lt;/ref&gt;After years of touring and struggling to make money, Cagney and Vernon moved to [[Hawthorne, California]], in 1924, partly for Cagney to meet his new mother-in-law, who had just moved there from Chicago, and partly to investigate breaking into the movies</span>
				<span class='text'>Their train fares were paid for by a friend, the press officer of ''Pitter Patter'', who was also desperate to act</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Warren5254&quot;&gt;Warren, pages 52–54&lt;/ref&gt; They were not successful at first; the dance studio Cagney set up had few clients and folded, and Vernon  and he toured the studios, but garnered no interest</span>
				<span class='text'>Eventually, they borrowed some money and headed back to New York via Chicago and [[Milwaukee]], enduring failure along the way when they attempted to make money on the stage</span>

				<span class='text'>He achieved varied success, but after appearing in ''Outside Looking In'',{{clarify|date=July 2011|Is Outside Looking In a play? A vaudeville act?}} the Cagneys were more financially secure</span>

				<span class='text'>He almost quit show business</span>
				<span class='text'>As Vernon recalled, &quot;Jimmy said that it was all over</span>

				<span class='text'>Vernon was in the chorus line of the show, and with help from the [[Actors’ Equity Association]], Cagney understudied Tracy on the Broadway show, providing them with a desperately needed steady income</span>

				<span class='text'>The show received rave reviews&lt;ref&gt;Warren, page 61&lt;/ref&gt; and was followed by ''Grand Street Follies of 1929''</span>
				<span class='text'>These roles led to a part in [[George Kelly (playwright)|George Kelly's]] ''Maggie the Magnificent'', a play the critics disliked, though they liked Cagney's performance</span>

				<span class='text'>He then sold the play to Warner Bros</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Warren, page 65&lt;/ref&gt; In the film, he portrays Harry Delano, a tough guy who becomes a killer, but generates sympathy because of his unfortunate upbringing</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;auteur25&quot;&gt;McGilligan, page 25&lt;/ref&gt; During filming of ''Sinners' Holiday'', he also demonstrated the stubbornness that characterized his work attitude</span>
				<span class='text'>He later recalled an argument he had with director [[John Adolfi]] about a line: &quot;There was a line in the show where I was supposed to be crying on my mother's breast</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>[The line] was 'I'm your baby, ain't I?' I refused to say it</span>

				<span class='text'> I said 'I don't give a shit what you tell him, I'm not going to say that line</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Warren67&quot;&gt;Warren, page 67&lt;/ref&gt;Despite this outburst, the studio liked him, and before his three-week contract was up—while the film was still shooting&lt;ref&gt;Cagney, page 39&lt;/ref&gt;—they gave Cagney a three-week extension, which was followed by a full seven-year contract at $400 a week</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Warren67&quot;/&gt; The contract, however, allowed Warners to drop him at the end of any 40-week period, effectively only guaranteeing him 40 weeks income at a time</span>
				<span class='text'>As when he was growing up, Cagney shared his income with his family</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Warren67&quot;/&gt; Cagney received good reviews, and immediately starred in another gangster role in ''[[The Doorway to Hell]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Warren80&quot;&gt;Warren, page 80&lt;/ref&gt;Cagney received widespread praise for his role</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' described his performance as &quot;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, pages 25–36&lt;/ref&gt; ''Night Nurse'' was actually released three months after ''The Public Enemy'', and Gable punched Stanwyck in the film, knocking her character unconscious, then carried her across the hall, where she woke up later</span>

				<span class='text'>Producer [[Darryl Zanuck]] claimed he thought of it in a script conference, director [[William Wellman]] claimed that the idea came to him when he saw the grapefruit on the table during the shoot, and writers Glasmon and Bright claimed it was based on the real life of gangster [[Hymie Weiss]], who threw an omelette into his girlfriend's face</span>
				<span class='text'>Cagney himself usually cited the writers' version, but the fruit's victim, Clarke, agreed that it was Wellman's idea, saying, &quot;I'm sorry I ever agreed to do the grapefruit bit</span>
				<span class='text'>I never dreamed it would be shown in the movie</span>
				<span class='text'>Director Bill Wellman thought of the idea suddenly</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;auteur34&quot;&gt;McGilligan, page 34&lt;/ref&gt;However, according to [[Turner Classic Movies]] (TCM), the grapefruit scene was a practical joke that Cagney and costar Mae Clarke decided to play on the crew while the cameras were rolling</span>
				<span class='text'>Wellman liked it so much that he left it in</span>
				<span class='text'>TCM also notes that the scene made Clarke's ex-husband, Lew Brice, very happy</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;He saw the film repeatedly just to see that scene, and was often shushed by angry patrons when his delighted laughter got too loud</span>

				<span class='text'>So keen was the studio to follow up the success of Robinson's ''Little Caesar'' that Cagney actually shot ''Smart Money'' (for which he received second billing in a supporting role) at the same time as ''The Public Enemy''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Warren, page 82&lt;/ref&gt; As in ''The Public Enemy'', Cagney was required to be physically violent to a woman on screen, a signal that Warner Bros</span>
				<span class='text'>was keen to keep Cagney in the public eye</span>
				<span class='text'>This time, he slapped co-star [[Evalyn Knapp]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;auteur37&quot;&gt;McGilligan, page 37&lt;/ref&gt;With the introduction of the United States [[Motion Picture Production Code]] of 1930, and particularly its edicts concerning on-screen violence, Warners allowed Cagney a change of pace</span>
				<span class='text'>They cast him in the comedy ''[[Blonde Crazy]]'', again opposite Blondell</span>
				<span class='text'>As he completed filming, ''The Public Enemy'' was filling cinemas with all-night showings</span>
				<span class='text'>Cagney began to compare his pay with his peers, thinking his contract allowed for salary adjustments based on the success of his films</span>
				<span class='text'>Warner Bros</span>
				<span class='text'>disagreed, however, and refused to give him a raise</span>
				<span class='text'>The studio heads also insisted that Cagney continue promoting their films, even ones he was not in, which he opposed</span>
				<span class='text'>Cagney moved back to New York, leaving his brother Bill to look after his apartment</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Warren, page 85&lt;/ref&gt;While Cagney was in New York, his brother, who had effectively become his agent, angled for a substantial pay raise and more personal freedom for his brother</span>
				<span class='text'>The success of ''The Public Enemy'' and ''Blonde Crazy'' forced Warner Bros</span>
				<span class='text'> hand</span>
				<span class='text'>They eventually offered Cagney a contract for $1000 a week</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Warren, page 89&lt;/ref&gt; Cagney's first film upon returning from New York was 1932's ''[[Taxi!]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The film is notable for not only being the first time that Cagney danced on screen, but it was also the last time he allowed himself to be shot at with live ammunition (a relatively common occurrence at the time, as [[Blank (cartridge)|blank cartridges]] and [[Squib (explosive)|squibs]] were considered too expensive and hard to find to use in most motion picture filming)</span>
				<span class='text'>He had been shot at in ''The Public Enemy'', but during filming for ''Taxi!'', he was almost hit</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Warren90&quot;&gt;Warren, page 90&lt;/ref&gt;In his opening scene, Cagney spoke fluent [[Yiddish]], a language he had picked up during his boyhood in New York City</span>

				<span class='text'>Cagney announced that he would do his next three pictures for free if they canceled the five years remaining on his contract</span>
				<span class='text'>He also threatened to quit Hollywood and go back to Columbia University to follow his brothers into medicine</span>
				<span class='text'>After six months of suspension, [[Frank Capra]] brokered a deal that increased Cagney's salary to around $3000 a week, and guaranteed top billing and no more than four films a year</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Warren, pages 94–95&lt;/ref&gt;Having learned about the block-booking [[studio system]] that almost guaranteed the studios huge profits, Cagney was determined to spread the wealth</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Warren, page 96&lt;/ref&gt; His insistence on no more than four films a year was based on his having witnessed actors—even teenagers—regularly being worked 100 hours a week to turn out more films</span>
				<span class='text'>This experience was an integral reason for his involvement in forming the [[Screen Actors Guild]] in 1933</span>

				<span class='text'>The overriding message of violence inevitably leading to more violence attracted Cagney to the role of an [[Irish Republican Army]] commander, and resulted in what some critics would regard as the finest performance of his final years</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Warren, pages 199–200&lt;/ref&gt;Cagney's career began winding down, and he made only one film in 1960, the critically acclaimed ''[[The Gallant Hours]]'', in which he played [[William F</span>

				<span class='text'>He was hand-picked by [[Billy Wilder]] to play a hard-driving [[Coca-Cola]] executive in the film ''[[One, Two, Three]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Warren, page 202&lt;/ref&gt; Cagney had concerns with the script, remembering back 23 years to ''Boy Meets Girl'', in which scenes were reshot to try to make them funnier by speeding up the pacing, with the opposite effect</span>
				<span class='text'>Cagney received assurances from Wilder that the script was balanced</span>
				<span class='text'>Filming did not go well, though, with one scene requiring 50 takes, something to which Cagney was unaccustomed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, page 151&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, it was one of the worst experiences of his long career</span>
				<span class='text'>For the first time, Cagney considered walking out of a film</span>
				<span class='text'>He felt he had worked too many years inside studios, and combined with a visit to [[Dachau concentration camp]] during filming, he decided that he had had enough, and retired afterward</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Warren, page 204&lt;/ref&gt; One of the few positive aspects was his friendship with [[Pamela Tiffin]], to whom he gave acting guidance, including the secret that he had learned over his career: &quot;You walk in, plant yourself squarely on both feet, look the other fella in the eye, and tell the truth</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Warren203&quot;&gt;Warren, page 203&lt;/ref&gt;===1961–86: Later years and retirement===Cagney remained in retirement for 20 years, conjuring up images of Jack L</span>
				<span class='text'>Warner every time he was tempted to return, which soon dispelled the notion</span>
				<span class='text'>After he had turned down an offer to play Alfred Doolittle in ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Warren 207&quot;&gt;Warren, page 207&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cagney197&quot;&gt;Cagney, page 197&lt;/ref&gt; he found it easier to rebuff others, including a part in ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Cagney197&quot;/&gt; He made few public appearances, preferring to spend winters in Los Angeles, and summers either at his Martha's Vineyard farm or at Verney Farms in New York</span>
				<span class='text'>When in New York, Billie Vernon and he held numerous parties at the Silver Horn restaurant, where they got to know Marge Zimmerman, the proprietress</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Warren, page 210&lt;/ref&gt;Cagney was diagnosed with [[glaucoma]] and began taking eye drops, but continued to have vision problems</span>
				<span class='text'>On Zimmerman's recommendation, he visited a different doctor, who determined that glaucoma had been a misdiagnosis, and that Cagney was actually [[diabetes|diabetic]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Zimmerman then took it upon herself to look after Cagney, preparing his meals to reduce his blood [[triglyceride]]s, which had reached alarming levels</span>
				<span class='text'>Such was her success that, by the time Cagney made a rare public appearance at his American Film Institute Lifetime Achievement award ceremony in 1974, he had lost {{convert|20|lb}} and his vision had improved</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Warren, page 211&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charlton Heston]] opened the ceremony, and [[Frank Sinatra]] introduced Cagney</span>
				<span class='text'>So many Hollywood stars attended—said to be more than for any event in history—that one columnist wrote at the time that a bomb in the dining room would have ended the movie industry</span>
				<span class='text'>In his acceptance speech, Cagney lightly chastised the impressionist [[Frank Gorshin]], saying, &quot;Oh, Frankie, just in passing, I never said 'MMMMmmmm, you dirty rat!' What I actually did say was 'Judy, Judy, Judy!'&quot;—a joking reference to a similar misquotation attributed to Cary Grant</span>

				<span class='text'>After two weeks in the hospital, Zimmerman became his full-time caregiver, traveling with Billie Vernon and him wherever they went</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Warren, page 212&lt;/ref&gt; After the stroke, Cagney was no longer able to undertake many of his favorite pastimes, including horseback riding and dancing, and as he became more [[depression (mood)|depressed]], he even gave up painting</span>
				<span class='text'>Encouraged by his wife and Zimmerman, Cagney accepted an offer from the director [[Miloš Forman]] to star in a small but pivotal role in the film ''[[Ragtime (film)|Ragtime]]'' (1981)</span>
				<span class='text'>his film was shot mainly at [[Shepperton Studios]] in [[Surrey]], England, and on his arrival at [[Southampton]] aboard the ''[[RMS Queen Elizabeth 2|Queen Elizabeth 2]]'', Cagney was mobbed by hundreds of fans</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Cunard Line]] officials, who were responsible for the security at the dock, said they had never seen anything like it, although they had experienced past visits by [[Marlon Brando]] and [[Robert Redford]]</span>
				<span class='text'>espite the fact that ''Ragtime'' was his first film in 20 years, Cagney was immediately at ease: Flubbed lines and miscues were committed by his co-stars, often simply through sheer awe</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Howard Rollins]], who received a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his performance, said, &quot;I was frightened to meet Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Cagney</span>
				<span class='text'>I asked him how to die in front of the camera</span>
				<span class='text'>He said 'Just die!' It worked</span>
				<span class='text'>Who would know more about dying than him?&quot; Cagney also repeated the advice he had given to Pamela Tiffin, [[Joan Leslie]], and Lemmon</span>
				<span class='text'>As filming progressed, Cagney's [[sciatica]] worsened, but he finished the nine-week filming, and reportedly stayed on the set after completing his scenes to help the other actors with their dialogue</span>
				<span class='text'>agney's frequent co-star, Pat O'Brien, appeared with him on the British chat show ''[[Parkinson (TV series)|Parkinson]]'' in the early 1970s, and they both made a surprise appearance at the [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Mother]]'s command birthday performance at the [[London Palladium]] in 1980</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;As a young man, Cagney became interested in farming – sparked by a [[soil conservation]] lecture he had attended&lt;ref name=&quot;auteur16&quot;/&gt; – to the extent that during his first walkout from Warner Bros</span>
				<span class='text'> he helped to found a {{convert|100|acre|km2|adj=on}} farm in Martha's Vineyard</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McCabe, pg 41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cagney, page 69&lt;/ref&gt; Cagney loved that no concrete roads surrounded the property, only dirt tracks</span>
				<span class='text'>The house was rather run-down and ramshackle, and Billie was initially reluctant to move in, but soon came to love the place, as well</span>
				<span class='text'>After being inundated by movie fans, Cagney sent out a rumor that he had hired a gunman for security</span>
				<span class='text'>The ruse proved so successful that when Spencer Tracy came to visit, his taxi driver refused to drive up to the house, saying, &quot;I hear they shoot!&quot; Tracy had to go the rest of the way on foot</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Warren, page 122&quot;/&gt;In 1955, having shot three films, Cagney bought a {{convert|120|acre|km2|adj=on}} farm in [[Stanford, New York|Stanfordville]], [[Dutchess County]], New York, for $100,000</span>
				<span class='text'>Cagney named it Verney Farm, taking the first syllable from Billie's maiden name and the second from his own surname</span>
				<span class='text'>He turned it into a working farm, selling some of the dairy cattle and replacing them with beef cattle</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Warren195&quot;&gt;Warren, page 195&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cagney, page 176&lt;/ref&gt; He expanded it over the years to {{convert|750|acre|km2}}</span>
				<span class='text'>Such was Cagney's enthusiasm for agriculture and farming that his diligence and efforts were rewarded by an honorary degree from Florida's [[Rollins College]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Rather than just &quot;turning up with [[Ava Gardner]] on my arm&quot; to accept his honorary degree, Cagney turned the tables upon the college's faculty by writing and submitting a paper on soil conservation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Warren195&quot;/&gt;Cagney, born in 1899 (prior to widespread use of automobiles) loved horses from childhood</span>
				<span class='text'>As a child, he often sat on the horses of local deliverymen, and rode in horse-drawn streetcars with his mother</span>
				<span class='text'>As an adult, well after horses were replaced by automobiles as the primary mode of transportation, Cagney raised horses on his farms, specializing in [[Morgan horse|Morgans]], a breed of which he was particularly fond</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cagney, page 175&lt;/ref&gt;Cagney was a keen sailor and owned boats harbored on both US coasts,&lt;ref&gt;Warren, pages 194–195&lt;/ref&gt;  His joy in sailing, however, did not protect him from occasional [[seasickness]]—becoming ill, sometimes, on a calm day while weathering rougher, heavier seas&lt;ref&gt;Cagney, page 174&lt;/ref&gt; at other times</span>
				<span class='text'>Cagney greatly enjoyed painting,&lt;ref name=&quot;Warren220&quot;&gt;Warren, page 220&lt;/ref&gt; and claimed in his autobiography that he might have been happier, if somewhat poorer, as a painter than a movie star</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cagney, page 170&lt;/ref&gt; The renowned painter [[Sergei Bongart]] taught Cagney in his later life and owned two of Cagney's works</span>
				<span class='text'>Cagney often gave away his work, but refused to sell his paintings, considering himself an amateur</span>
				<span class='text'>He signed and sold only one painting, purchased by [[Johnny Carson]] to benefit a charity</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Warren220&quot;/&gt;===Political views===In his autobiography, Cagney said that as a young man, he had no political views, since he was more concerned with where the next meal was coming from</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Cagney183&quot;&gt;Cagney, page 183&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the emerging labor movement of the '20s and '30s soon forced him to take sides</span>
				<span class='text'>The first version of the [[National Labor Relations Act]] was passed in 1935 and growing tensions between labor and management fueled the movement</span>
				<span class='text'>Fanzines in the 1930s, however, described his politics as &quot;radical&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, page 193&lt;/ref&gt; This somewhat exaggerated view was enhanced by his public contractual wranglings with Warner Bros</span>
				<span class='text'>at the time, his joining of the Screen Actors Guild in 1933, and his involvement in the revolt against the so-called &quot;Merriam tax&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The &quot;Merriam tax&quot; was an underhanded method of funneling studio funds to politicians; during the [[California gubernatorial election, 1934|1934 Californian gubernatorial]] campaign, the studio executives would 'tax' their actors, automatically taking a day's pay from their biggest-earners, ultimately sending nearly half a million dollars to the gubernatorial campaign of [[Frank Merriam]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Cagney (as well as [[Jean Harlow]]) publicly refused to pay&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, page 192&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cagney, pages 185–186&lt;/ref&gt; and Cagney even threatened that, if the studios took a day's pay for Merriam's campaign, he would give a week's pay to [[Upton Sinclair]], Merriam's opponent in the race</span>
