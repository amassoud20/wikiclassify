				<span class='text'>The others sought court determinations that insurance companies and individual lawyers failed to defend Rosenthal properly before Olson and in appellate stages</span>
				<span class='text'>In April 1979, he filed an unsuccessful suit to set aside the $6&amp;nbsp;million settlement with Day and recover damages from everyone involved in agreeing, supposedly without his permission, to the payment</span>

				<span class='text'>In June 1987, Rosenthal filed a $30&amp;nbsp;million lawsuit against lawyers he claimed cheated him out of millions of dollars in real estate investments</span>
				<span class='text'>He named Day as a co-defendant, describing her as an &quot;unwilling, involuntary plaintiff whose consent cannot be obtained&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Rosenthal claimed that millions of dollars Day lost were in real estate sold after Melcher died in 1968, in which Rosenthal asserted that the attorneys gave Day bad advice, telling her to sell, at a loss, three hotels, in [[Palo Alto, California]], [[Dallas, Texas]] and [[Atlanta, Georgia]] and some oil leases in [[Kentucky]] and [[Ohio]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Rosenthal claimed he had made the investments under a long-term plan, and did not intend to sell them until they appreciated in value</span>
				<span class='text'>Two of the hotels sold in 1970 for about $7&amp;nbsp;million, and their estimated worth in 1986 was $50&amp;nbsp;million</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Disbarred1987/&gt; The State Bar Court's review department upheld the panel's findings, which asked the justices to order Rosenthal's disbarment</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Circuit Court of Appeals followed on August 19, 1988</span>
				<span class='text'>The Supreme Court of California, in affirming the disbarment, held that Rosenthal had engaged in transactions involving undisclosed conflicts of interest, took positions adverse to his former clients, overstated expenses, double-billed for legal fees, failed to return client files, failed to provide access to records, failed to give adequate legal advice, failed to provide clients with an opportunity to obtain independent counsel, filed fraudulent claims, gave false testimony, engaged in conduct designed to harass his clients, delayed court proceedings, obstructed justice and abused legal process</span>
