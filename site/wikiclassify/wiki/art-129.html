				<span class='text'>He was one of the most influential of the [[classical economics|classical economists]], along with [[Thomas Malthus]], [[Adam Smith]], and [[James Mill]]</span>

				<span class='text'>om/david-ricardo/&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps his most important legacy is his theory of [[comparative advantage]], which suggests that a nation should concentrate its resources solely in industries where it is ''most'' internationally competitive while trading with other countries to obtain products either never produced nationally or no longer produced nationally as a result of industry specialisation</span>
				<span class='text'>  In essence, Ricardo promoted the idea of extreme industry specialization by nations, to the point of dismantling internationally competitive and otherwise profitable industries</span>
				<span class='text'> In this world view Ricardo took as a given the existence of an industry policy aimed at promoting and/or subsidising some national industries to the detriment of others</span>
				<span class='text'> For Ricardo central planning was a given</span>
				<span class='text'> Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage has been challenged by, among others, [[Joan Robinson]] and [[Piero Sraffa]], but remains the cornerstone of the argument in favour of international free trade</span>
				<span class='text'> Comparative advantage paved the way for the promotion of globalization via increased international trade, which is the guiding theme in the policies promoted by the [[OECD]] and the [[World Trade Organization]], where it is assumed that international trade automatically leads to increased economic prosperity</span>
				<span class='text'> The results of the implementation of this type of policy agenda are [[Free trade debate|debated]] and increasingly [http://economyincrisis</span>
				<span class='text'>rg/content/ten-problems-free-trade controversial]</span>
				<span class='text'> That said, the assumption that increased levels of international trade is economically beneficial is generally unchallenged in mainstream economics</span>
				<span class='text'> Ricardo began his professional life as a financial market broker and  financial market [[speculation|speculator]]</span>
				<span class='text'> As a result he amassed  a considerable personal fortune, with his largest windfall coming as a direct result of the carefully planned manipulation of British financial markets which he undertook during the Battle of Waterloo in 1815</span>
				<span class='text'> Immediately following this questionable financial coup he retired</span>
				<span class='text'> He was 41 years old</span>
				<span class='text'> In February 1819 he entered British [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] following his purchase of a seat in August 1818</span>

				<span class='text'> Ricardo challenged the idea that the purpose of trade was merely to accumulate gold or silver</span>
				<span class='text'> With &quot;comparative advantage&quot; Ricardo argued in favour of industry specialisation and [[free trade]]</span>
				<span class='text'> He attempted to prove, using simple mathematics, that industry specialization combined with free international trade always produces positive results</span>
				<span class='text'>This theory expanded on the concept of [[absolute advantage]]</span>
				<span class='text'>icardo argued that there is mutual national benefit from trade even if one country is more competitive in every area than its trading counterpart and that a nation should concentrate resources only on industries where it had a comparative advantage,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Trade Question |last= Roberts |first=Paul Craig |periodical=Washington Times |publication-date=2003-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that is in those industries in which it has the greatest competitive edge</span>
				<span class='text'> Ricardo suggested that national industries which were, in fact, profitable and internationally competitive should be jettisoned in favour of the most competitive industries</span>
				<span class='text'> Ricardo's theory of [[comparative advantage]] assumes the existence of an industry and trade policy at a national level</span>
				<span class='text'>  It does not presume that business decisions are or should be made independently by entrepreneurs on the basis of viability or profit</span>
				<span class='text'>icardo attempted to prove, using a simple numerical example, that international trade is always beneficial</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; &quot;In spite of the fact that the Portuguese could produce both cloth and wine with less amount of labor, Ricardo suggested that ''theoretically'' both countries benefit from trade with each other</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;As [[Joan Robinson]] subsequently pointed out in reality following an opening of free trade with England, Portugal endured centuries of economic underdevelopment: &quot;the imposition of free trade on Portugal killed off a promising textile industry and left her with a slow-growing export market for wine, while for England, exports of cotton cloth led to accumulation, mechanisation and the whole spiralling growth of the industrial revolution&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Robinson argued that Ricardo's example required that economies were in static equilibrium positions with full employment and that there could not be a trade deficit or a trade surplus</span>
				<span class='text'>These conditions, she wrote, were not relevant to the real world</span>
				<span class='text'>She also argued that Ricardo's theory did not take into account that some countries may be at different levels of development and that this raised the prospect of 'unequal exchange' which might hamper a country's development, as we saw in the case of Portugal</span>

				<span class='text'>He believed that the British &quot;[[Corn Laws]]&quot;—tariffs on agricultural products—ensured that less-productive domestic land would be harvested and rents would be driven up {{harv|Case|Fair|1999|pp=812, 813}}</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, profits would be directed toward landlords and away from the emerging industrial capitalists</span>
				<span class='text'>Since Ricardo believed landlords tended to squander their wealth on luxuries, rather than invest, he believed that the Corn Laws were leading to the stagnation of the British economy</span>

				<span class='text'>==Value theory===Ricardo's most famous work is his ''[[Principles of Political Economy and Taxation]]'' (1817)</span>
				<span class='text'>Ricardo opens the first chapter with a statement of the [[labor theory of value]]</span>
				<span class='text'> His labour theory of value required several assumptions:# both sectors have the same wage rate and the same profit rate;# the capital employed in production is made up of wages only;# the period of production has the same length for both goods</span>
				<span class='text'>icardo himself realized that the second and third assumptions were quite unrealistic and hence admitted two exceptions to his labour theory of value:# production periods may differ;# the two production processes may employ instruments and equipment as capital and not just wages, and in very different proportions</span>
				<span class='text'>icardo continued to work on his [[value theory]] to the end of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>He has been credited with influencing famous investor Nate Moody and ultimately his value theory was the basis for what we now refer to as the Moody effect as it pertains to equities===Rent==={{Main|Law of rent}}Ricardo is responsible for developing theories of rent, wages, and profits</span>
				<span class='text'>He defined [[Economic rent|rent]] as &quot;the difference between the produce obtained by the employment of two equal quantities of capital and labor</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;  Ricardo believed that the process of economic development, which increased land utilization and eventually led to the cultivation of poorer land, principally benefited landowners</span>
				<span class='text'> According to Ricardo, such premium over &quot;real social value&quot; that is reaped due to ownership constitutes value to an individual but is at best&lt;ref&gt;On The Principles of Political Economy and Taxation London: John Murray, Albemarle-Street, by David Ricardo, 1817 (third edition 1821) – Chapter 6, On Profits: paragraph 28, &quot;Thus, taking the former </span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot; and paragraph 33, &quot;There can, however</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; a paper monetary return to &quot;society&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The portion of such purely individual benefit, and exclusively that portion, that accrues to scarce resources such as land or gold, over and above any socially beneficial exchange, Ricardo labels &quot;rent&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>icardo concluded that a [[Land value tax|tax on land value]], equivalent to a tax on the land rent, minus the improvements, was the only form of taxation that would not lead to price increases</span>
				<span class='text'>Land itself has no cost of production, because it is not produced by humans</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, the price is not determined by the cost, but only by the best available rent-free alternative, not by the tax burdens of the person claiming exclusive use</span>
				<span class='text'>===Malthus's criticism and Extrapolation of the problem of Ricardian Rent====In attempting to demonstrate that Ricardian Rent constitutes value for nothing Ricardo was neglecting [[Say's Law]] that all savings by-definition-equals investment</span>
				<span class='text'> Malthus suggested that rent, however misplaced, constitutes a prime source of savings and investment for the future</span>
				<span class='text'>==Ricardo's theories of wages and profits===Several authorities consider that Ricardo is the source of the concepts behind the so-called [[Iron Law of Wages]], according to which wages naturally tend to a subsistence level</span>

				<span class='text'>His laissez-faire doctrines were typified in his Iron Law of Wages, which stated that all attempts to improve the real income of workers were futile and that wages perforce remained near the subsistence level</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Kenneth Galbraith, ''Economics in Perspective'', &quot;Returning to wages, Ricardo, in another of his greatly quoted passages, says that they are 'That price which is necessary to enable the labourers, one with another, to subsist and to perpetuate their race, without either increase or diminution</span>

				<span class='text'>He said in his ''Essay on Profits'', &quot;Profits depend on high or low wages, wages on the price of necessaries, and the price of necessaries chiefly on the price of food</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;== Criticism of the Ricardian theory of trade ==Ricardo's argument in favour of [[free trade]] has been attacked by those who believe trade restriction can be necessary for the economic development of a nation</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Utsa Patnaik]] claims that Ricardian theory of [[international trade]] contains a logical fallacy</span>
				<span class='text'>Ricardo assumed that in both countries two goods are producible and actually are produced, but developed and underdeveloped countries often trade those goods which are not producible in their own country</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, many Northern countries do not produce tropical fruits</span>
				<span class='text'>In these cases, one cannot define which country has comparative advantage</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Uta |last=Patnaik |year=2005 |chapter=Ricardo's Fallacy/ Mutual Benefit from Trade Based on Comparative Costs and Specialization? |editor-last=Jomo |editor-first=K</span>

				<span class='text'>In the real world, events outside the realm of human control (e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>natural disasters) can disrupt production</span>
				<span class='text'>In this case, specialisation could cripple a country that depends on imports from foreign, naturally disrupted countries</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, if an industrially based country trades its manufactured goods with an [[agrarian country]] in exchange for agricultural products, a natural disaster in the agricultural country (e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>drought) may cause an industrially based country to starve</span>
				<span class='text'>he development economist [[Ha-Joon Chang]] challenges the argument that free trade benefits every country:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ricardo’s theory is absolutely right—within its narrow confines</span>
				<span class='text'>His theory correctly says that, ''accepting their current levels of technology as given'', it is better for countries to specialize in things that they are relatively better at</span>
				<span class='text'>One cannot argue with that</span>
				<span class='text'> His theory fails when a country wants to acquire more advanced technologies—that is, when it wants to develop its economy</span>
				<span class='text'>It takes time and experience to absorb new technologies, so technologically backward producers need a period of protection from international competition during this period of learning</span>
				<span class='text'>Such protection is costly, because the country is giving up the chance to import better and cheaper products</span>
				<span class='text'>However, it is a price that has to be paid if it wants to develop advanced industries</span>
				<span class='text'>Ricardo’s theory is, thus seen, for those who accept the ''status quo'' but not for those who want to change it</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Chang, Ha-Joon (2007), &quot;Bad Samaritans&quot;, Chapter 2, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>30–31</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;==Ricardian equivalence==Another idea associated with Ricardo is [[Ricardian equivalence]], an argument suggesting that in some circumstances a government's choice of how to pay for its spending (''i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>'' whether to use tax revenue or issue debt and run a deficit) might have no effect on the economy</span>
				<span class='text'>Ricardo notes that the proposition is theoretically implied in the presence of intertemporal optimisation by rational tax-payers: but that since tax-payers do not act so rationally, the proposition fails to be true in practice</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, while the proposition bears his name, he does not seem to have believed it</span>
				<span class='text'>Economist [[Robert Barro]] is responsible for its modern prominence</span>
				<span class='text'>=His influence and intellectual legacy==David Ricardo's ideas had a tremendous influence on later developments in economics</span>
				<span class='text'>US economists rank Ricardo as the second most influential economic thinker, behind Adam Smith, prior to the twentieth century</span>

				<span class='text'>rg/articles/economics-professors-favorite-economic-thinkers-journals-and-blogs-along-with-party-and-policy-views]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Ricardo became the theoretical father of classical political economy</span>
				<span class='text'>However, [[Joseph Schumpeter|Schumpeter]] coined an expression ''Ricardian vice'', which indicates that rigorous logic does not provide a good economic theory</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Schumpeter, ''History of Economic Analysis'', (published posthumously, ed</span>
				<span class='text'>Elisabeth Boody Schumpeter), 1954</span>
				<span class='text'>pp</span>
				<span class='text'>569, 1171</span>
				<span class='text'>Schumpeter also criticized J</span>
				<span class='text'>M</span>
				<span class='text'>Keynes for committing the same Ricardian vice</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This criticism applies also to most neoclassical theories, which make heavy use of mathematics, but are, according to him, theoretically unsound, because the conclusion being drawn does not logically follow from the theories used to defend it</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}===Ricardian socialists===Ricardo's writings fascinated a number of early socialists in the 1820s, who thought his value theory had radical implications</span>
				<span class='text'>They argued that, in view of labor theory of value, labor produces the entire product, and the profits capitalists get are a result of exploitations of workers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Landreth Colander 1989 ''History of Economic Thought'' Second Edition, p</span>
				<span class='text'>37</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; These include [[Thomas Hodgskin]], [[William Thompson (philosopher)|William Thompson]], [[John Francis Bray]], and [[Percy Ravenstone]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==Georgists===Georgists believe that rent, in the sense that Ricardo used, belongs to the community as a whole</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Henry George]] was greatly influenced by Ricardo, and often cited him, including in his most famous work, [[Progress and Poverty]] from 1879</span>
				<span class='text'>In the preface to the fourth edition, he wrote: ''&quot;What I have done in this book, if I have correctly solved the great problem I have sought to investigate, is, to unite the truth perceived by the school of Smith and Ricardo to the truth perceived by the school of Proudhon and Lasalle; to show that laissez faire (in its full true meaning) opens the way to a realization of the noble dreams of socialism; to identify social law with moral law, and to disprove ideas which in the minds of many cloud grand and elevating perceptions</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;''&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry George|George, Henry]], [[Progress and Poverty]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Preface to the 4th Edition, November 1880</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Neo-Ricardians===After the rise of the 'neoclassical' school, Ricardo's influence declined temporarily</span>
				<span class='text'>It was [[Piero Sraffa]], the editor of the Collected Works of David Ricardo&lt;ref&gt;Piero Sraffa and M</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Dobb, editors (1951–1973)</span>
				<span class='text'>''The Works and Correspondence of David Ricardo''</span>
				<span class='text'>Cambridge University Press, 11 volumes</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and the author of seminal ''Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities'',&lt;ref&gt;Sraffa, Piero 1960, ''Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities: Prelude to a Critique of Economic Theory''</span>
				<span class='text'>Cambridge University Press</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; who resurrected Ricardo as the originator of another strand of economics thought, which was effaced with the arrival of the neoclassical school</span>
				<span class='text'>The new interpretation of Ricardo and Sraffa's criticism against the marginal theory of value gave rise to a new school, now named neo-Ricardian or Sraffian school</span>
				<span class='text'>Major contributors to this school includes [[Luigi Pasinetti]] (1930–), [[Pierangelo Garegnani]] (1930–2011), [[Ian Steedman]] (1941–), [[Geoffrey Harcourt]] (1931–), [[Heinz Kurz]] (1946–), [[Neri Salvadori]] (1951–), [[Pier Paolo Saviotti]] (–) among others</span>
				<span class='text'>See also [[Neo-Ricardianism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Neo-Ricardian school is sometimes seen to be a component of [[Post-Keynesian economics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>===Neo-Ricardian trade theory====Inspired by [[Piero Sraffa]], a new strand of trade theory emerged and was named neo-Ricardian trade theory</span>
				<span class='text'>The main contributors include [[Ian Steedman]] and [[Stanley Metcalfe]]</span>
				<span class='text'>They have criticised neoclassical international trade theory, namely the [[Heckscher–Ohlin model]] on the basis that the notion of capital as primary factor has no method of measuring it before the determination of profit rate (thus trapped in a logical vicious circle)</span>
