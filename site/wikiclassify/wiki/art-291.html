				<span class='text'>This was followed on October 3, 1948, by an appearance on the NBC series ''[[Welcome Aboard (NBC TV series)|Welcome Aboard]]'', then a stint as the first of a series of hosts of ''[[The Colgate Comedy Hour]]'' in 1950</span>

				<span class='text'>Teaming with director [[Frank Tashlin]], whose background as a [[Warner Bros</span>
				<span class='text'>] ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' cartoon director suited Lewis's brand of humor, he starred in five more films, and even appeared uncredited as Itchy McRabbitt in ''[[Li'l Abner (1959 film)|Li'l Abner]]'' (1959)</span>
				<span class='text'>Lewis tried his hand at releasing solo music in the 1950s, having a chart hit with the song &quot;[[Rock-a-Bye Your Baby with a Dixie Melody]]&quot; (a song largely associated with [[Al Jolson]] and later re-popularized by [[Judy Garland]]) as well as the song, &quot;[[It All Depends on You]]&quot; in 1958</span>

				<span class='text'>Wallis]], Lewis had several productions of his own under his belt</span>
				<span class='text'>His first three efforts, ''[[The Delicate Delinquent]]'' (1957), ''[[Rock-A-Bye Baby (film)|Rock-A-Bye Baby]]'' (1958) and ''[[The Geisha Boy]]'' (1958), were all efforts to move away from Wallis, whom Lewis felt was hindering his comedy</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} In 1959, a contract between Paramount Pictures and Jerry Lewis Productions was signed specifying a payment of $10 million plus 60% of the profits for 14 films over a seven-year period</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Krutnik|first=Frank |title=Inventing Jerry Lewis |publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press |year=2000 |page=105 |isbn=978-1560983699}}&lt;/ref&gt;In 1960, Lewis finished his contract with Wallis with ''[[Visit to a Small Planet]]'' (1960), and wrapped up work on his own production, ''[[Cinderfella]]'', which was postponed for a Christmas 1960 release, and Paramount, needing a quickie feature film for its summer 1960 schedule, held Lewis to his contract to produce one</span>
				<span class='text'>Lewis came up with ''[[The Bellboy]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Using the [[Fontainebleau Hotel]] in Miami as his setting—and on a small budget, with a very tight shooting schedule, and no script—Lewis shot the film by day and performed at the hotel in the evenings</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Bill Richmond (writer)|Bill Richmond]] collaborated with him on the many sight gags</span>
				<span class='text'>Lewis later revealed that Paramount was not happy financing a 'silent movie' and withdrew backing</span>
				<span class='text'>Lewis used his own funds to cover the $950,000 budget</span>
				<span class='text'>During production Lewis developed the technique of using video cameras and multiple closed circuit monitors, which allowed him to review his performance instantly</span>
				<span class='text'>His techniques and methods, documented in his book and his USC class, enabled him to complete most of his films on time and under budget</span>
				<span class='text'>Lewis followed ''The Bellboy'' by directing several more films that he co-wrote with Richmond, including ''[[The Ladies Man]]'' (1961), ''[[The Errand Boy]]'' (1961), ''[[The Patsy (1964 film)|The Patsy]]'' (1964) and ''[[The Nutty Professor]]'' (1963)</span>
				<span class='text'>Lewis occasionally handed directing reins to [[Frank Tashlin]], who directed several of his productions, including ''[[It's Only Money]]'' (1962) and ''[[Who's Minding the Store?]]'' (1963)</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Jerry Lewis show</span>

				<span class='text'>Lewis played all six uncles and the bodyguard</span>
				<span class='text'>On television, Lewis starred in and hosted three different programs called ''[[The Jerry Lewis Show]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The first was a two-hour Saturday night variety show on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in the fall of 1963</span>
				<span class='text'>The lavish, big-budget production failed to find an audience and was canceled after 13 weeks</span>
				<span class='text'>His next was a one-hour variety show on [[NBC]] from 1967 to 1969</span>
				<span class='text'>Then a test of a syndicated talk show for Metromedia in 1984 was not continued beyond the scheduled five shows</span>
				<span class='text'>By 1966, Lewis, then 40, was no longer an angular juvenile, his routines seemed more labored and his box office appeal waned to the point where Paramount Pictures new executives felt no further need for the Lewis comedies and did not wish to renew his 1959 profit sharing contract</span>
				<span class='text'>Undaunted, Lewis packed up and went to [[Columbia Pictures]], where he made several more comedies</span>

				<span class='text'>The film was a drama set in a Nazi concentration camp</span>
				<span class='text'>Lewis rarely discusses the experience, but once explained why the film has not been released, by suggesting litigation over post-production financial difficulties</span>
				<span class='text'>However, he admitted during his book tour for ''Dean and Me'' that a major factor for the film's burial is that he is not proud of the effort</span>
