				<span class='text'>G</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Grace''', &lt;small&gt;[[Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons|MRCS]]&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;small&gt;[[Royal College of Physicians|LRCP]]&lt;/small&gt; (18 July 1848 – 23 October 1915) was an [[English (people)|English]] [[Amateur status in first-class cricket|amateur]] [[cricket]]er who was important in the development of the sport and is widely considered one of its greatest-ever players</span>
				<span class='text'>Universally known as &quot;W</span>
				<span class='text'>G</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;, he played [[first-class cricket]] for a record-equalling 44 seasons, from 1865 to 1908, during which he captained [[England national cricket team|England]], [[Gloucestershire County Cricket Club|Gloucestershire]], the [[Gentlemen cricket team|Gentlemen]], [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC), the [[United South of England Eleven]] (USEE) and several other teams</span>
				<span class='text'>He came from a cricketing family: the appearance in 1880 of W</span>
				<span class='text'>G</span>
				<span class='text'>with [[E</span>
				<span class='text'>M</span>
				<span class='text'>Grace]], one of his elder brothers, and [[Fred Grace]], his younger brother, was the first time three brothers played together in [[Test cricket]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[Right-handed]] as both [[batting (cricket)|batsman]] and [[bowling (cricket)|bowler]], Grace dominated the sport during his career</span>
				<span class='text'>His technical innovations and enormous influence left a lasting legacy</span>
				<span class='text'>An outstanding [[all-rounder]], he excelled at all the essential skills of batting, bowling and [[fielding (cricket)|fielding]], but it is for his batting that he is most renowned</span>
				<span class='text'>He is held to have invented modern batsmanship</span>
				<span class='text'>Usually [[opening batsman|opening the innings]], he was particularly admired for his mastery of all strokes, and his level of expertise was said by contemporary reviewers to be unique</span>
				<span class='text'>He generally captained the teams he played for at all levels because of his skill and tactical acumen</span>
				<span class='text'>race qualified as a [[physician|medical practitioner]] in 1879</span>
				<span class='text'>Because of his medical profession, he was nominally an amateur cricketer but he is said to have made more money from his cricketing activities than any [[professionalism|professional cricketer]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was an extremely competitive player and, although he was one of the most famous men in England, he was also one of the most controversial on account of his [[gamesmanship]] and moneymaking</span>
				<span class='text'>e took part in other sports also: he was a champion 440-yard [[hurdling|hurdler]] as a young man and also played [[association football|football]] for the [[Wanderers F</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Wanderers]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In later life, he developed enthusiasm for [[golf]], [[lawn bowls]] and [[curling]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Early years=====Childhood==={{Main|Grace family}}W</span>
				<span class='text'>G</span>
				<span class='text'>Grace was born in [[Downend, South Gloucestershire|Downend]], near [[Bristol]], on 18 July 1848 at his parents' home, Downend House, and was baptised at the local church on 8 August</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Rae16&quot;&gt;Rae, p</span>
				<span class='text'>6</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He was called Gilbert in the family circle, except by his mother who called him Willie,&lt;ref name=&quot;Rae16&quot; /&gt; but otherwise he was universally known by his initials W</span>
				<span class='text'>G</span>
				<span class='text'>His parents were Henry Mills Grace and Martha (''née'' Pocock), who were married in Bristol on Thursday, 3 November 1831 and lived out their lives at Downend, where Henry Grace was the local [[General Practitioner|GP]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Rae, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>–11</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Downend is near [[Mangotsfield]] and, although it is now a suburb of Bristol, it was then &quot;a distinct village surrounded by countryside&quot; and about four miles from Bristol</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Rae11&quot;&gt;Rae, p</span>
				<span class='text'>1</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Henry and Martha Grace had nine children in all: &quot;the same number as [[Queen Victoria|Victoria]] and [[Albert, Prince Consort|Albert]] – and in every respect they were the typical Victorian family&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Rae12&quot;&gt;Rae, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>2–13</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Grace was the eighth child in the family; he had three older brothers, including [[E</span>
				<span class='text'>M</span>
				<span class='text'>Grace|E</span>
				<span class='text'>M</span>
				<span class='text'>], and four older sisters</span>
				<span class='text'>Only [[Fred Grace|Fred]], born in 1850, was younger than W</span>
				<span class='text'>G</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Mid9&quot;&gt;Midwinter, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>–10</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Grace began his ''Cricketing Reminiscences'' (1899) by answering a question he had frequently been asked: i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> was he &quot;born a cricketer&quot;? His answer was in the negative because he believed that &quot;cricketers are made by coaching and practice&quot;, though he adds that if he was not born a cricketer, he was born &quot;in the atmosphere of cricket&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Grace, ''Reminiscences'', p</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; His father and mother were &quot;full of enthusiasm for the game&quot; and it was &quot;a common theme of conversation at home&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Grace, ''Reminiscences'', p</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In 1850, when W</span>
				<span class='text'>G</span>
				<span class='text'>was two and Fred was expected, the family moved to a nearby house called &quot;The Chesnuts&quot; which had a sizeable orchard and Henry Grace organised clearance of this to establish a practice pitch that was to become famous throughout the world of cricket</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Mid12&quot;/&gt; All nine children in the Grace family, including the four daughters, were encouraged to play cricket although the girls, along with the dogs, were required for fielding only</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Mid11&quot;&gt;Midwinter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>1</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Grace claimed that he first handled a cricket bat at the age of two</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Mid12&quot;&gt;Midwinter, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>1–12</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; It was in the Downend orchard and as members of their local cricket clubs that he and his brothers developed their skills, mainly under the tutelage of his uncle, Alfred Pocock, who was an exceptional coach</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Rae15&quot;/&gt; Apart from his cricket and his schooling, Grace lived the life of a country boy and roamed freely with the other village boys</span>
				<span class='text'>One of his regular activities was stone throwing at birds in the fields and he later claimed that this was the source of his eventual skill as an outfielder</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Rae, p</span>
				<span class='text'>1&quot;&gt;Rae, p</span>
				<span class='text'>1</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Education===Grace was &quot;notoriously unscholarly&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Rae21&quot;&gt;Rae, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>1–22</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; His first schooling was with a Miss Trotman in Downend village and then with a Mr Curtis of Winterbourne</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Rae21&quot; /&gt; He subsequently attended a [[day school]] called Ridgway House, run by a Mr Malpas, until he was fourteen</span>
				<span class='text'>One of his schoolmasters, David Barnard, later married Grace's sister Alice</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Rae21&quot; /&gt; In 1863, Grace was taken seriously ill with [[pneumonia]] and his father removed him from Ridgway House</span>
				<span class='text'>After this illness, Grace grew rapidly to his full height of 6&amp;nbsp;ft 2 in (1</span>
				<span class='text'>8 m)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Rae38&quot;&gt;Rae, p</span>
				<span class='text'>8</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He continued his education at home where one of his tutors was the Reverend John Dann, who was the Downend [[parish church]] curate; like Mr Barnard before him, Mr Dann became Grace's [[brother-in-law]], marrying Blanche Grace in 1869</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Rae, p</span>
				<span class='text'>9</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Grace never went to university as his father was intent upon him pursuing a medical career</span>
				<span class='text'>But Grace was approached by both [[Oxford University Cricket Club]] and [[Cambridge University Cricket Club]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1866, when he played a match at Oxford, one of the Oxford players, [[Edmund Carter]], tried to interest him in becoming an undergraduate</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Rae, p</span>
				<span class='text'>3</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Then, in 1868, Grace received overtures from [[Caius College]], Cambridge, which had a long medical tradition</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;R78&quot; /&gt; Grace said he would have gone to either Oxford or Cambridge if his father had allowed it</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;R78&quot; /&gt; Instead, he enrolled at [[Bristol Medical School]] in October 1868, when he was 20</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;R78&quot;&gt;Rae, p</span>
				<span class='text'>8</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Development as a cricketer===Henry Grace founded Mangotsfield Cricket Club in 1845 to represent several neighbouring villages including Downend</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Mid12&quot; /&gt; In 1846, this club merged with the West Gloucestershire Cricket Club whose name was adopted until 1867</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Rae15&quot;&gt;Rae, p</span>
				<span class='text'>5</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; It has been said that the Grace family ran the West Gloucestershire &quot;almost as a private club&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Rae15&quot;/&gt; Henry Grace managed to organise matches against [[Lansdown Cricket Club]] in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], which was the premier West Country club</span>
				<span class='text'>West Gloucestershire fared poorly in these games and, sometime in the 1850s, Henry and Alfred Pocock decided to join Lansdown, although they continued to run the West Gloucestershire and this remained their primary club</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Rae34&quot;&gt;Rae, p</span>
				<span class='text'>4</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Alfred Pocock was especially instrumental in coaching the Grace brothers and spent long hours with them on the practice pitch at Downend</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;A124&quot;&gt;Altham, p</span>
				<span class='text'>24</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; E</span>
				<span class='text'>M</span>
				<span class='text'> who was seven years older than W</span>
				<span class='text'>G</span>
				<span class='text'> had always played with a full size bat and so developed a tendency, that he never lost, to hit across the line, the bat being too big for him to &quot;play straight&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Pocock recognised this problem and determined that W</span>
				<span class='text'>G</span>
				<span class='text'>and his youngest brother Fred should not follow suit</span>
				<span class='text'>He therefore fashioned smaller bats for them, to suit their sizes, and they were taught to play straight and &quot;learn defence, with the left shoulder well forward&quot;, before attempting to hit</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;A124&quot; /&gt;Grace recorded in his ''Reminiscences'' that he saw his first great cricket match in 1854 when he was barely six years old, the occasion being a game between [[William Clarke's All-England Eleven]] (the AEE) and twenty-two of West Gloucestershire</span>
				<span class='text'>He says he himself played for the West Gloucestershire club as early as 1857, when he was nine years old, and had 11 innings in 1859</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=GR8/&gt; The earliest match in ''[[CricketArchive]]'' which involved Grace was in 1859, only a few days after his eleventh birthday, when he played for Clifton Cricket Club against the [[South Wales cricket team|South Wales Cricket Club]] at [[Durdham Down]], his team winning by 114 runs</span>
				<span class='text'>Several members of the Grace family, including his elder brother E</span>
				<span class='text'>M</span>
				<span class='text'> were involved in the match</span>
				<span class='text'>Grace batted at number 11 and scored 0 and 0 not out</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; It was through E</span>
				<span class='text'>M</span>
				<span class='text'>that the family name first became famous</span>
				<span class='text'>His mother, Martha, wrote the following in a letter to [[William Clarke (English cricketer)|William Clarke]]'s successor [[George Parr (cricketer)|George Parr]] in 1860 or 1861:&lt;ref&gt;Rae, p</span>

				<span class='text'>It may interest you to learn that I have another son, now twelve years of age, who will in time be a much better player than his brother because his back stroke is sounder, and he always plays with a straight bat''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/blockquote&gt;Grace was just short of his thirteenth birthday when, on 5 July 1861, he made his debut for Lansdown and played two matches that month</span>

				<span class='text'>Most of these were ''ad hoc'' or guest appearances</span>
				<span class='text'>In minor cricket, Grace represented upwards of forty teams</span>
				<span class='text'>Besides playing for England in [[Test cricket]] (1880–99), the key teams in Grace's first-class career were the [[Gentlemen cricket team|Gentlemen]] (1865–1906), [[All-England cricket teams|All-England ''aka'' England]] (i</span>

				<span class='text'>Grace's cricket career (1864 to 1870)}}Cricket in the 1860s underwent a revolution with the legalisation of [[overarm bowling]] in June 1864 and Grace himself said it was &quot;no exaggeration to say that, between 1860 and 1870, English cricket passed through its most critical period&quot; with the game in transition and &quot;it was quite a revolutionary period so far as its rules were concerned&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Grace was still 15 when the 1864 season began and had turned 20 when the 1868 season ended and he began his medical career by enrolling at [[Bristol Medical School]] on 7 October 1868</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In the interim, specifically in 1866, he became widely recognised as the finest cricketer in England</span>
				<span class='text'>Just after his eighteenth birthday in July 1866, Grace confirmed his potential with an innings of 224 [[not out]] for All-England against [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] at The Oval</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Later years===Despite his age and bulk, Grace continued to play minor cricket for several years after his retirement from the first-class version</span>
				<span class='text'>His penultimate match, and the last in which he batted, was for Eltham Cricket Club at Grove Park on 25 July 1914, a week after his 66th birthday</span>
				<span class='text'>He contributed an undefeated 69 to a total of 155–6 declared, having begun his innings when they were 31–4</span>
				<span class='text'>Grove Park made 99–8 in reply</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Rae, p</span>
				<span class='text'>86</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;On 26 August, in response to news of casualties at the [[Battle of Mons]], Grace wrote a letter to ''[[The Sportsman (1865 newspaper)|The Sportsman]]'' in which he called for the immediate closure of the county cricket season and for all first-class cricketers to set an example and serve their country</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Midwinter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>49</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; It was published next day but did not, as is often supposed, bring an immediate end to the cricket season as one further round of County Championship matches was played</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Rae, p</span>
				<span class='text'>87</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Grace was reportedly distressed by the war and was known to shake his fist and shout at the German [[Zeppelin]]s floating over his home in [[South London]]</span>

				<span class='text'>His fundamental opinion was that cricketers are &quot;not born&quot; but must be nurtured to develop their skills through coaching and practice; in his own case, he had achieved his skill through constant practice as a boy at home under the tutelage of his uncle Alfred Pocock</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Rae, p</span>
				<span class='text'>7</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Although the [[work ethic]] was of prime importance in his development, Grace insisted that cricket must also be enjoyable and freely admitted that his family all played in a way that was &quot;noisy and boisterous&quot; with much &quot;chaff&quot; (i</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;James, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>36–237</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Ranjitsinhji wrote that, by his extraordinary skills, Grace &quot;revolutionised cricket and developed most of the techniques of modern batting&quot; and was &quot;the bible of batsmanship&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Before him, batsmen would play either forward or back and make a speciality of a certain stroke</span>
				<span class='text'>Grace &quot;made utility the criterion of style&quot; and incorporated both forward and back play into his repertoire of strokes, favouring only that which was appropriate to the ball being delivered at the moment</span>
				<span class='text'>In an oft-quoted phrase, Ranjitsinhji said of Grace that &quot;he turned the old one-stringed instrument (i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> the [[cricket bat]]) into a many-chorded lyre&quot; and that &quot;the theory of modern batting is in all essentials the result of W</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;James, p</span>
				<span class='text'>37</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Ranjitsinhji summarised Grace's importance to the development of cricket by writing: &quot;I hold him to be not only the finest player born or unborn, but the maker of modern batting&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Birley, p</span>
				<span class='text'>67</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Cricket writer and broadcaster [[John Arlott]], writing in 1975, supported this view by holding that Grace &quot;created modern cricket&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Arlott, p</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;But Grace's extraordinary skill had already been recognised very early in his career, especially by the professional bowlers</span>
				<span class='text'>A very prescient comment was made by the laconic [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]] and [[England national cricket team|England]] fast bowler [[Tom Emmett]] who, after playing against Grace for the first time in 1869, called him a &quot;nonsuch&quot; (without equal) who &quot;ought to be made to play with a littler bat&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;[[Harry Altham|H</span>

				<span class='text'>Altham]] pointed out that for most of Grace's career, he played on pitches that &quot;the modern schoolboy would consider unfit for a house match&quot; and on grounds without boundaries where every hit including those &quot;into the country&quot; had to be run in full</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;A123&quot; /&gt; [[Rowland Bowen]] records that 1895, the year of Grace's &quot;Indian Summer&quot;, was the season in which [[marl]] was first used as a binding agent in the composition of English pitches, its benefit being to ensure &quot;good lasting wickets&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;RB140&quot;&gt;Bowen, p</span>
				<span class='text'>40</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;It was through Alfred Pocock's perseverance that Grace had learned to play straight and to develop a sound defence so that he would stop or leave the good deliveries and score off the poor ones</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Rae20&quot;&gt;Rae, p</span>
				<span class='text'>0</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This contrasted him with E</span>
				<span class='text'>M</span>
				<span class='text'>who was &quot;always a hitter&quot; and whose basic defence was not as sound</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Rae20&quot; /&gt; However, as Grace's skills developed, he became a very powerful hitter himself with a full range of shots and, at his best, would score runs freely</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite being an [[all-rounder]], Grace was also an [[opening batsman]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==Bowling===As a bowler, Grace belonged to what Altham calls the &quot;high, home and easy school of a much earlier day&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;BWC181&quot;/&gt; Using a [[roundarm bowling|roundarm]] action, Grace was adept at varying both his pace and the arc of his slower deliveries which worked in from the leg side of the pitch</span>
				<span class='text'>The chief feature of his bowling was the excellent length which he consistently maintained</span>
				<span class='text'>He originally bowled at a consistently fast medium pace but in the 1870s he increasingly adopted his slower style which utilised a [[leg break]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Fielding===In his prime, Grace was noted for his outstanding fielding and was a very strong thrower of the ball; he was once credited with throwing the [[cricket ball]] 122 yards during an athletics event at Eastbourne</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Rae69&quot;/&gt; He attributed this skill to his country-bred childhood in which stone throwing at crows was a daily exercise</span>
				<span class='text'>In later life, Grace commented upon a decline in English fielding standards and blamed it on &quot;the falling numbers of country-bred boys who strengthen their arms by throwing stones at birds in the fields&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Rae, p</span>
				<span class='text'>1&quot; /&gt;Much of Grace's success as a bowler was due to his magnificent fielding to his own bowling; as soon as he had delivered the ball he covered so much ground to the left that he made himself into an extra mid-off and he took some extraordinary catches in this way</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;W1916&quot; /&gt;In his early career, Grace generally fielded at long-leg or cover-point; later he was usually at point (see [[Fielding positions in cricket]])</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;W1916&quot; /&gt; In his prime, he was a fine thrower, a fast runner and a safe catcher</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;W1916&quot; /&gt;==Grace's amateur status==The expenses enquiry at Gloucestershire took place in January 1879</span>
				<span class='text'>W</span>
				<span class='text'>G</span>
				<span class='text'>and E</span>
				<span class='text'>M</span>
				<span class='text'>were forced to answer charges that they had claimed &quot;exorbitant expenses&quot;, one of the few times that their money-making activity was seriously challenged</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Birley, p</span>
				<span class='text'>27&quot;/&gt; The claim had been submitted to Surrey regarding the controversial 1878 match in which Billy Midwinter was brought in as a late replacement, but Surrey refused to pay it and this provoked the enquiry</span>
				<span class='text'>The Graces managed to survive &quot;a protracted and stormy meeting&quot; with E</span>
				<span class='text'>M</span>
				<span class='text'>retaining his key post as club secretary, although he was forced to liaise in future with a new finance committee and abide by stricter rules</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Birley, p</span>
				<span class='text'>27&quot; /&gt;The incident highlighted an ongoing issue about the nominal amateur status of the Grace brothers</span>
				<span class='text'>The amateur was, by definition, not a professional and the dictum of the amateur-dominated [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] was that &quot;a gentleman ought not to make any profit from playing cricket&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;RB112&quot;&gt;Bowen, p</span>
				<span class='text'>12</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Like all amateur players, they claimed expenses for travel and accommodation to and from cricket matches, but there is plenty of evidence that the Graces made even more money by playing than their basic expenses would allow and W</span>
				<span class='text'>G</span>
				<span class='text'>in particular &quot;made more than any professional&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Birley, p</span>
				<span class='text'>08</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; However, in his later years he had to pay for a ''locum tenens'' to run his medical practice while he was playing cricket and he had a reputation for treating his poorer patients without charging a fee</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;RB112&quot; /&gt; He was paid a salary for his roles as secretary and manager of the London County club</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;B162&quot; /&gt; He was the recipient of two national testimonials</span>
				<span class='text'>The first was presented to him by Lord Fitzhardinge at Lord's on 22 July 1879 in the form of a marble clock, two bronze ornaments and a cheque for [[Pound Sterling|£]]1,458</span>

				<span class='text'>Grace: &quot;Look here, we players intend to be sufficiently paid, as well as the so-called gentlemen!&quot;'']]Whatever criticisms may be made of Grace for making money for himself out of cricket, he was &quot;punctilious in his aid when (professional players) were the beneficiaries&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Midwinter, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>3–74</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; For example, when [[Alfred Shaw]]'s benefit match in 1879 was ruined by rain, Grace insisted on donating to Shaw the proceeds of another match that had been arranged to support Grace's own testimonial fund</span>
				<span class='text'>After the same thing happened to Edgar Willsher's benefit match, Grace took a select team to play Kent a few days later, the proceeds all going to Willsher</span>
				<span class='text'>On another occasion, he altered the date of a Gloucestershire match so that he could travel to Sheffield and take part in a Yorkshire player's benefit match, knowing full well the impact that his appearance would have on the gate</span>

				<span class='text'>02</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; As medical students, they faced considerable outlay in addition to their living expenses and it became imperative for them to make what they could out of cricket, especially the United South of England Eleven</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Rae102&quot;/&gt; Grace as its match organiser had to find gaps in the first-class fixture list and then pull together a team to visit a location where a suitable profit could be made</span>

				<span class='text'>G</span>
				<span class='text'>and Fred: a sizeable amount in 1872 when £100 was perhaps the equivalent of £3,000-plus at the end of the 20th century</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Rae103&quot;/&gt; Otherwise, Grace played for expenses but these were loaded as, for example, he is known to have claimed £15 per appearance for Gloucestershire and £20 for representing the Gentlemen</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Rae103&quot;/&gt; Although the money he was paid is &quot;small beer&quot; compared with 21st-century sports stars, there is no doubt he had a comfortable living out of cricket and made far more money than any contemporary professional</span>

				<span class='text'>Grace|Variations in first-class cricket statistics}}According to the statistical record used by ''CricketArchive'', Grace's final first-class appearance in 1908 was his 870th and concluded a first-class career that had lasted 44 seasons from 1865 to 1908, equalling the record for the longest career span held by [[John Sherman (cricketer)|John Sherman]], who played from 1809 to 1852</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Rae495&quot;/&gt;Grace himself regarded the South Wales matches in 1864 as first-class fixtures and refers to them in his ''Cricketing Reminiscences'' as &quot;really big&quot; games</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Grace, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>5–16</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He was supported in his view by ''Lillywhite's Guide to Cricketers'' (1865 edition) which included his innings at Hove in a list called ''Scores of 100 or more made since 1850 in first-class matches''</span>
				<span class='text'>Grace's score was one of only six that exceeded 150</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Rae, p</span>
				<span class='text'>2</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Despite Grace's own views on the matter, his &quot;first-class career record&quot; was effectively confirmed by [[F</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Ashley-Cooper]] who produced a list of season-by-season figures to supplement Grace's obituary in the 1916 edition of ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=R497/&gt; These figures came to be known as Grace's &quot;traditional&quot; career record and granted him 126 first-class centuries, a total beaten by [[Jack Hobbs]] in 1925; it was not until [[Roy Webber]]'s researches in the 1950s that Ashley-Cooper's list was challenged</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=R497&gt;Rae, p</span>
				<span class='text'>97</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Following further research by the [[Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians]] (ACS) in the 1970s and 1980s, an &quot;amended&quot; career record was published which reduced Grace's total of centuries to 124</span>
				<span class='text'>This was challenged, for historical reasons, by ''Wisden'' in 1983 and the current situation re this controversy is that both sides generally accept each other's views</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, Rae points out that the statisticians are right to criticise Victorian compilers for &quot;including minor matches to enable Grace to reach certain milestones&quot;; but he also respects the view of Grace's contemporaries that &quot;any match in which he played was elevated in status by his very presence&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; His entire life, including his cricket and medical careers, is inseparable from his [[Grace family|close-knit family background]] which was strongly influenced by his father Henry Grace, who set great store by qualifications and was determined to succeed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Rae3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rae mentions on page 3 that Dr Henry Grace's medical qualifications were Licenciate of the [[Worshipful Society of Apothecaries|Society of Apothecaries]] (LSA) in 1828 and [[Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons]] (MRCS) in 1830</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, like his father and his brothers, Grace chose a professional career in medicine, though because of his cricketing commitments he did not complete his qualification as a doctor until 1879 when he was 31 years old</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Grace's fame has endured and his large beard in particular remains familiar; for example, ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' uses his image as &quot;the face of God&quot; during the sequence in which God sends the knights out on their quest for the grail</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;In the [[Audio commentary (DVD)|commentary track]] of the DVD release, [[Terry Gilliam]] and [[Terry Jones]] acknowledge the use of Grace's image</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In many of the tributes paid to Grace, he was referred to as &quot;The Great Cricketer&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Harry Altham|H S Altham]], for one, described him as &quot;the greatest of all cricketers&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>James]], in his classic work ''[[Beyond a Boundary]]'', included a section &quot;W</span>
				<span class='text'>G</span>
				<span class='text'> Pre-Eminent Victorian&quot;, containing four chapters and covering some sixty pages</span>
				<span class='text'>He declared Grace &quot;the best-known Englishman of his time&quot; and aligned him with [[Thomas Arnold]] and [[Thomas Hughes]] as &quot;the three most eminent Victorians&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>James wrote of cricket as &quot;the game he (Grace) transformed into a national institution&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;James, ch</span>
				<span class='text'>4</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Simon Rae also commented upon Grace's eminence in Victorian England by saying that his public recognition was equalled only by [[Queen Victoria]] herself and [[William Ewart Gladstone]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Rae1&quot;&gt;Rae, p</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The inaugural edition of ''[[Playfair Cricket Annual]]'' in 1948 coincided with the centenary of Grace's birth and carried a tribute which spoke of Grace as &quot;King in his own domain&quot; and his &quot;Olympian personality&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>''Playfair'' went on to say how Grace had &quot;pulverised fast bowling on chancy pitches&quot; and had then &quot;astonished the world&quot; by his deeds during the 1895 &quot;Indian Summer&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;PCA10&quot;/&gt; In the foreword of the same edition, C</span>
				<span class='text'>B</span>
				<span class='text'>Fry insisted that Grace would not have started the 1948 season with any notion of being beaten by that season's Australian touring team, for &quot;he was sanguine&quot; and would have put everything he could muster into the task of beating them with no acceptance of defeat &quot;till after it happened&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; As mentioned in ''Playfair'', both MCC and Gloucestershire arranged special matches on Grace's birthday to commemorate his centenary</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;PCA10&quot;/&gt;In the 1963 edition of ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'', Grace was selected by [[Neville Cardus]] as one the [[Six Giants of the Wisden Century]]</span>

				<span class='text'>The other five players chosen were [[Sydney Barnes]], [[Don Bradman]], [[Jack Hobbs]], [[Tom Richardson]] and [[Victor Trumper]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[Derek Birley]], who devoted whole passages of his book to criticism of Grace's gamesmanship and moneymaking, wrote that the &quot;bleakness (of the war) was exemplified in November (''sic'') 1915 by the death of Grace, which seemed depressingly emblematic of the end of an era&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Birley, p</span>
				<span class='text'>08</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Rowland Bowen wrote that &quot;many of Grace's achievements would be rated extremely good by our standards&quot; but &quot;by the standards of his day they were ''phenomenal'': nothing like them had ever been done before&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bowen, p</span>
				<span class='text'>08</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; [[David Frith]] summed up Grace's legacy to cricket by writing that &quot;his influence lasted long after his final appearance in first-class cricket in 1908 and his death in 1915&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;For decades&quot;, wrote Frith, &quot;Grace had been arguably the most famous man in England&quot;, easily recognisable because of &quot;his beard and his bulk&quot;, and revered because of &quot;his batsmanship&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Even though his records have been overtaken, &quot;his pre-eminence has not&quot; and he remains &quot;the most famous cricketer of them all&quot;, the one who &quot;elevated the game in public esteem&quot;</span>
