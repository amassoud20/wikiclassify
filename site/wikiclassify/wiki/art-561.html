				<span class='text'>James was intended to benefit from the major share of his father's encouragement,  affection and financial support and was prepared for a career in engineering</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1832, his father was appointed professor of mathematics at Glasgow and the family moved there in October 1833</span>

				<span class='text'>He attended the [[Royal Belfast Academical Institution]], where his father was a professor in the university department, before beginning study at Glasgow University in 1834 at the age of 10, not out of any precociousness; the University provided many of the facilities of an elementary school for able pupils, and this was a typical starting age</span>
				<span class='text'>n school, Thomson showed a keen interest in the classics along with his natural interest in the sciences</span>
				<span class='text'>At the age of 12 he won a prize for translating [[Lucian of Samosata]]'s ''Dialogues of the Gods'' from [[Latin]] to English</span>
				<span class='text'>n the academic year 1839/1840, Thomson won the class prize in [[astronomy]] for his ''Essay on the figure of the Earth'' which showed an early facility for mathematical analysis and creativity</span>
				<span class='text'>Throughout his life, he would work on the problems raised in the essay as a [[coping (psychology)|coping]] strategy during times of personal [[stress (medicine)|stress]]</span>
				<span class='text'>On the title page of this essay Thomson wrote the following lines from [[Alexander Pope]]'s ''[[Essay on Man]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>These lines inspired Thomson to understand the natural world using the power and method of science:{{quote|Go, wondrous creature! mount where Science guides; &lt;br /&gt;Go measure earth, weigh air, and state the tides; &lt;br /&gt;Instruct the planets in what orbs to run, &lt;br /&gt;Correct old Time, and regulate the sun;  }}Thomson became intrigued with [[Joseph Fourier|Fourier's]] ''Théorie analytique de la chaleur'' and committed himself to study the &quot;Continental&quot; mathematics resisted by a British establishment still working in the shadow of Sir [[Isaac Newton]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Unsurprisingly, Fourier's work had been attacked by domestic mathematicians, [[Philip Kelland]] authoring a critical book</span>
				<span class='text'>The book motivated Thomson to write his first published [[scientific paper]]&lt;ref&gt;P</span>

				<span class='text'>The study of [[mathematics]], physics, and in particular, of electricity, had captivated his imagination</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Hubert von Herkomer03</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Lord Kelvin by [[Hubert von Herkomer]]&lt;/center&gt;]]In 1845, he gave the first mathematical development of [[Michael Faraday|Faraday]]'s idea that electric induction takes place through an intervening medium, or &quot;dielectric&quot;, and not by some incomprehensible &quot;action at a distance&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He also devised the mathematical technique of electrical images, which became a powerful agent in solving problems of electrostatics, the science which deals with the forces between electrically charged bodies at rest</span>
				<span class='text'>It was partly in response to his encouragement that Faraday undertook the research in September 1845 that led to the discovery of the [[Faraday effect]], which established that light and magnetic (and thus electric) phenomena were related</span>
				<span class='text'>e was elected a fellow of [[Peterhouse, Cambridge|St</span>

				<span class='text'>At twenty-two he found himself wearing the gown of a learned professor in one of the oldest Universities in the country, and lecturing to the class of which he was a first year student but a few years before</span>
				<span class='text'>==Thermodynamics===By 1847, Thomson had already gained a reputation as a precocious and maverick scientist when he attended the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] annual meeting in [[Oxford]]</span>
				<span class='text'>At that meeting, he heard [[James Prescott Joule]] making yet another of his, so far, ineffective attempts to discredit the [[caloric theory]] of heat and the theory of the [[heat engine]] built upon it by [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] and [[Émile Clapeyron]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Joule argued for the mutual convertibility of heat and [[mechanical work]] and for their mechanical equivalence</span>
				<span class='text'>homson was intrigued but sceptical</span>
				<span class='text'>Though he felt that Joule's results demanded theoretical explanation, he retreated into an even deeper commitment to the Carnot–Clapeyron school</span>
				<span class='text'>He predicted that the [[melting point]] of ice must fall with [[pressure]], otherwise its expansion on freezing could be exploited in a ''[[perpetual motion|perpetuum mobile]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Experimental confirmation in his laboratory did much to bolster his beliefs</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1848, he extended the Carnot–Clapeyron theory still further through his dissatisfaction that the [[gas thermometer]] provided only an [[operational definition]] of temperature</span>
				<span class='text'>He proposed an ''[[absolute temperature]] scale''&lt;ref&gt;Chang (2004), Ch</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt; in which ''a unit of heat descending from a body A at the temperature ''T''° of this scale, to a body B at the temperature (''T''−1)°, would give out the same mechanical effect ''[work]'', whatever be the number'' T''</span>
				<span class='text'>' Such a scale would be ''quite independent of the physical properties of any specific substance</span>
				<span class='text'>'&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, W</span>
				<span class='text'>(1848) &quot;On an Absolute Thermometric Scale founded on Carnot's Theory of the Motive Power of Heat, and calculated from Regnault's observations&quot; ''Math</span>
				<span class='text'>and Phys</span>
				<span class='text'>Papers'' vol</span>
				<span class='text'>1, ''pp'' 100–106&lt;/ref&gt; By employing such a &quot;waterfall&quot;, Thomson postulated that a point would be reached at which no further heat (caloric) could be transferred, the point of ''[[absolute zero]]'' about which [[Guillaume Amontons]] had speculated in 1702</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Reflections on the Motive Power of Heat&quot;, published by Carnot in French in 1824, the year of Lord Kelvin's birth, used −267 as an estimate of the absolute zero temperature</span>
				<span class='text'> Thomson used data published by Regnault to [[calibration|calibrate]] his scale against established measurements</span>
				<span class='text'>n his publication, Thomson wrote:{{Quotation|</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>The conversion of heat (or ''caloric'') into mechanical effect is probably impossible, certainly undiscovered}}— But a footnote signalled his first doubts about the caloric theory, referring to Joule's ''very remarkable discoveries''</span>
				<span class='text'>Surprisingly, Thomson did not send Joule a copy of his paper, but when Joule eventually read it he wrote to Thomson on 6 October, claiming that his studies had demonstrated conversion of heat into work but that he was planning further experiments</span>
				<span class='text'>Thomson replied on 27 October, revealing that he was planning his own experiments and hoping for a reconciliation of their two views</span>
				<span class='text'>homson returned to critique Carnot's original publication and read his analysis to the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] in January 1849,&lt;ref&gt;— (1949) &quot;An Account of Carnot's Theory of the Motive Power of Heat; with Numerical Results deduced from Regnault's Experiments on Steam&quot; ''Math</span>
				<span class='text'>and Phys</span>
				<span class='text'>Papers'' vol</span>
				<span class='text'>, ''pp'' 113–155&lt;/ref&gt; still convinced that the theory was fundamentally sound</span>
				<span class='text'>However, though Thomson conducted no new experiments, over the next two years he became increasingly dissatisfied with Carnot's theory and convinced of Joule's</span>
				<span class='text'>In February 1851 he sat down to articulate his new thinking</span>
				<span class='text'>However, he was uncertain of how to frame his theory and the paper went through several drafts before he settled on an attempt to reconcile Carnot and Joule</span>
				<span class='text'>During his rewriting, he seems to have considered ideas that would subsequently give rise to the [[second law of thermodynamics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In Carnot's theory, lost heat was ''absolutely lost'' but Thomson contended that it was &quot;''lost to man'' irrecoverably; but not lost in the material world&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, his [[theology|theological]] beliefs led to speculation about the [[heat death of the universe]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{Quotation|I believe the tendency in the material world is for motion to become diffused, and that as a whole the reverse of concentration is gradually going on – I believe that no physical action can ever restore the heat emitted from the Sun, and that this source is not inexhaustible; also that the motions of the Earth and other planets are losing ''[[vis viva]]'' which is converted into heat; and that although some ''vis viva'' may be restored for instance to the earth by heat received from the sun, or by other means, that the loss cannot be ''precisely'' compensated and I think it probable that it is under compensated</span>

				<span class='text'>}Though now eminent in the academic field, Thomson was obscure to the general public</span>
				<span class='text'>In September 1852, he married childhood sweetheart Margaret Crum, daughter of [[Walter Crum]];&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=36507|title=Thomson, William|first=Crosbie|last=Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt; but her health broke down on their honeymoon and, over the next seventeen years, Thomson was distracted by her suffering</span>
				<span class='text'>On 16 October 1854, [[George Gabriel Stokes]] wrote to Thomson to try to re-interest him in work by asking his opinion on some experiments of [[Michael Faraday]] on the proposed [[transatlantic telegraph cable]]</span>
				<span class='text'>araday had demonstrated how the construction of a cable would limit the rate at which messages could be sent – in modern terms, the [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]]</span>

				<span class='text'>'87&lt;/ref&gt; Thomson stressed the impact that the design of the cable would have on its [[profit (accounting)|profit]]ability</span>
				<span class='text'>homson contended that the speed{{clarify|reason=Speed or transit time?|date=March 2015}} of a signal through a given core{{clarify|reason=Is this simply a wire?|date=March 2015}} was inversely proportional to the [[square (algebra)|square]] of the length of the core</span>
				<span class='text'>Thomson's results were disputed at a meeting of the British Association in 1856 by [[Wildman Whitehouse]], the [[electrician]] of the [[Atlantic Telegraph Company]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Whitehouse had possibly misinterpreted the results of his own experiments but was doubtless feeling financial pressure as plans for the cable were already well underway</span>
				<span class='text'>He believed that Thomson's calculations implied that the cable must be &quot;abandoned as being practically and commercially impossible</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;Thomson attacked Whitehouse's contention in a letter to the popular ''[[Athenaeum (magazine)|Athenaeum]]'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, W</span>

				<span class='text'>However, he thought Whitehouse no fool and suspected that he might have the practical skill to make the existing design work</span>
				<span class='text'>Thomson's work had, however, caught the eye of the project's undertakers and in December 1856, he was elected to the board of directors of the Atlantic Telegraph Company</span>
				<span class='text'>==Scientist to engineer===Thomson became scientific adviser to a team with Whitehouse as chief electrician and Sir [[Charles Tilston Bright]] as chief engineer but Whitehouse had his way with the [[specification]], supported by Faraday and [[Samuel F</span>

				<span class='text'>homson sailed on board the cable-laying ship {{HMS|Agamemnon|1852|6}} in August 1857, with Whitehouse confined to land owing to illness, but the voyage ended after {{convert|380|mi|km}} when the cable parted</span>
				<span class='text'>Thomson contributed to the effort by publishing in the ''Engineer'' the whole theory of the [[stress (physics)|stress]]es involved in the laying of a submarine [[cable]], and showed that when the line is running out of the ship, at a constant speed, in a uniform depth of water, it sinks in a slant or straight incline from the point where it enters the water to that where it touches the bottom</span>

				<span class='text'>&amp;nbsp;seconds</span>
				<span class='text'>He patented the key elements of his system, the [[mirror galvanometer]] and the [[siphon recorder]], in 1858</span>
				<span class='text'>hitehouse still felt able to ignore Thomson's many suggestions and proposals</span>
				<span class='text'>It was not until Thomson convinced the board that using purer copper for replacing the lost section of cable would improve data capacity, that he first made a difference to the execution of the project</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Sharlin (1979) ''p</span>
				<span class='text'>'141&lt;/ref&gt;The board insisted that Thomson join the 1858 cable-laying expedition, without any financial compensation, and take an active part in the project</span>
				<span class='text'>In return, Thomson secured a trial for his mirror galvanometer, about which the board had been unenthusiastic, alongside Whitehouse's equipment</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Thomson found the access he was given unsatisfactory and the ''Agamemnon'' had to return home following the disastrous storm of June 1858</span>
				<span class='text'>Back in London, the board was on the point of abandoning the project and mitigating their losses by selling the cable</span>
				<span class='text'>Thomson, [[Cyrus West Field]] and [[Curtis M</span>
				<span class='text'>Lampson]] argued for another attempt and prevailed, Thomson insisting that the technical problems were tractable</span>
				<span class='text'>Though employed in an advisory capacity, Thomson had, during the voyages, developed real engineer's instincts and skill at practical problem-solving under pressure, often taking the lead in dealing with emergencies and being unafraid to lend a hand in manual work</span>
				<span class='text'>A cable was finally completed on 5 August</span>
				<span class='text'>==Disaster and triumph===Thomson's fears were realized when Whitehouse's apparatus proved insufficiently sensitive and had to be replaced by Thomson's mirror galvanometer</span>
				<span class='text'>Whitehouse continued to maintain that it was his equipment that was providing the service and started to engage in desperate measures to remedy some of the problems</span>
				<span class='text'>He succeeded only in fatally damaging the cable by applying 2,000&amp;nbsp;[[Volt|V]]</span>
				<span class='text'>When the cable failed completely Whitehouse was dismissed, though Thomson objected and was reprimanded by the board for his interference</span>
				<span class='text'>Thomson subsequently regretted that he had acquiesced too readily to many of Whitehouse's proposals and had not challenged him with sufficient energy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Sharlin (1979) ''p</span>
				<span class='text'>'144&lt;/ref&gt;A joint committee of inquiry was established by the [[Board of Trade]] and the Atlantic Telegraph Company</span>

				<span class='text'>Thomson was appointed one of a five-member committee to recommend a specification for a new cable</span>
				<span class='text'>The committee reported in October 1863</span>

				<span class='text'>The cable was lost after {{convert|1200|mi|km}} had been laid and the expedition had to be abandoned</span>
				<span class='text'>A further expedition in 1866 managed to lay a new cable in two weeks and then go on to recover and complete the 1865 cable</span>
				<span class='text'>The enterprise was now feted as a triumph by the public and Thomson enjoyed a large share of the adulation</span>
				<span class='text'>Thomson, along with the other principals of the project, was [[knighted]] on 10 November 1866</span>

				<span class='text'>In conjunction with the latter, he also devised an [[automatic curb sender]], a kind of [[telegraph key]] for sending messages on a cable</span>
				<span class='text'>==Later expeditions===Thomson took part in the laying of the French Atlantic [[submarine communications cable]] of 1869, and with Jenkin was engineer of the Western and Brazilian and Platino-Brazilian cables, assisted by vacation student [[James Alfred Ewing]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was present at the laying of the [[Belém|Pará]] to [[Pernambuco]] section of the Brazilian coast cables in 1873</span>
				<span class='text'>homson's wife had died on 17 June 1870 and he resolved to make changes in his life</span>
				<span class='text'>Already addicted to seafaring, in September he purchased a 126&amp;nbsp;ton [[schooner]], the ''Lalla Rookh'' and used it as a base for entertaining friends and scientific colleagues</span>
				<span class='text'>His maritime interests continued in 1871 when he was appointed to the board of enquiry into the sinking of the {{HMS|Captain|1869|6}}</span>
				<span class='text'>n June 1873, Thomson and Jenkin were on board the ''Hooper'', bound for [[Lisbon]] with {{convert|2500|mi|km|-1}} of cable when the cable developed a fault</span>
				<span class='text'>An unscheduled 16-day stop-over in [[Madeira]] followed and Thomson became good friends with Charles R</span>
				<span class='text'>Blandy and his three daughters</span>
				<span class='text'>On 2 May 1874 he set sail for Madeira on the ''Lalla Rookh''</span>
				<span class='text'>As he approached the harbour, he signalled to the Blandy residence &quot;Will you marry me?&quot; and Fanny signalled back &quot;Yes&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>=Thomson and Tait: ''Treatise on Natural Philosophy''=={{Main|Treatise on Natural Philosophy}}Over the period 1855 to 1867, Thomson collaborated with [[Peter Guthrie Tait]] on a [[text book]] that founded the study of [[mechanics]] first on the mathematics of [[kinematics]], the description of motion without regard to [[force]]</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|Thomson's [[tide-predicting machine]]]]Thomson was an enthusiastic yachtsman, his interest in all things relating to the sea perhaps arising from, or at any rate fostered by, his experiences on the ''Agamemnon'' and the ''[[SS Great Eastern|Great Eastern]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>homson introduced a method of deep-sea [[Echo sounding|sounding]], in which a steel [[piano wire]] replaces the ordinary hand line</span>
				<span class='text'>The wire glides so easily to the bottom that &quot;flying soundings&quot; can be taken while the ship is going at full speed</span>
				<span class='text'>A pressure gauge to register the depth of the sinker was added by Thomson</span>
				<span class='text'>bout the same time he revived the [[Sumner method]] of finding a ship's place at sea, and calculated a set of tables for its ready application</span>
				<span class='text'>He also developed a [[tides|tide]] predicting machine</span>
				<span class='text'>uring the 1880s, Thomson worked to perfect the adjustable [[compass]] in order to correct errors arising from [[magnetic deviation]] owing to the increasing use of iron in [[naval architecture]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Thomson's design was a great improvement on the older instruments, being steadier and less hampered by friction, the deviation due to the ship's own magnetism being corrected by movable masses of iron at the [[binnacle]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Thomson's innovations involved much detailed work to develop principles already identified by [[George Biddell Airy]] and others but contributed little in terms of novel physical thinking</span>
				<span class='text'>Thomson's energetic lobbying and networking proved effective in gaining acceptance of his instrument by [[The Admiralty]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{quotation | Scientific biographers of Thomson, if they have paid any attention at all to his compass innovations, have generally taken the matter to be a sorry saga of dim-witted naval administrators resisting marvellous innovations from a superlative scientific mind</span>
				<span class='text'>Writers sympathetic to the Navy, on the other hand, portray Thomson as a man of undoubted talent and enthusiasm, with some genuine knowledge of the sea, who managed to parlay a handful of modest ideas in compass design into a commercial monopoly for his own manufacturing concern, using his reputation as a bludgeon in the law courts to beat down even small claims of originality from others, and persuading the Admiralty and the law to overlook both the deficiencies of his own design and the virtues of his competitors'</span>

				<span class='text'>=Electrical standards==Thomson did more than any other electrician up to his time in introducing accurate methods and apparatus for measuring electricity</span>
				<span class='text'>As early as 1845 he pointed out that the experimental results of [[William Snow Harris]] were in accordance with the laws of [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb|Coulomb]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In the ''Memoirs of the Roman Academy of Sciences'' for 1857 he published a description of his new divided ring [[electrometer]], based on the old electroscope of [[Johann Gottlieb Friedrich von Bohnenberger]] and he introduced a chain or series of effective instruments, including the quadrant electrometer, which cover the entire field of electrostatic measurement</span>
				<span class='text'>He invented the [[current balance]], also known as the ''Kelvin balance'' or ''Ampere balance'' (''SiC''), for the [[accuracy and precision|precise]] specification of the [[ampere]], the [[standardisation|standard]] [[Units of measurement|unit]] of [[electric current]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1893, Thomson headed an international commission to decide on the design of the [[Niagara Falls]] [[power station]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite his belief in the superiority of [[direct current]] [[electric power transmission]], he endorsed Westinghouse's [[alternating current]] system which had been demonstrated at the [[World's Columbian Exposition|Chicago World's Fair]] of that year</span>
				<span class='text'>Even after Niagara Falls Thomson still held to his belief that direct current was the superior system</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;David Lindley, ''Degrees Kelvin: A Tale of Genius, Invention, and Tragedy'', page 293&lt;/ref&gt;Acknowledging his contribution to electrical standardisation, the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] elected Thomson as its first President at its preliminary meeting, held in London on 26–27 June 1906</span>

				<span class='text'>(1889) [[s:William Thomson's account of his Christian faith|Address to the Christian Evidence Society]]&lt;/ref&gt;One of the clearest instances of this interaction is in his estimate of the [[age of the Earth]]</span>
