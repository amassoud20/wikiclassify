				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;PBS&quot; /&gt; Instead of numbering the chimpanzees she observed, she gave them names such as Fifi and David Greybeard, and observed them to have unique and individual personalities, an unconventional idea at the time</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;PBS&quot; /&gt; Goodall insists that these gestures are evidence of &quot;the close, supportive, affectionate bonds that develop between family members and other individuals within a community, which can persist throughout a life span of more than 50 years</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS&quot; /&gt; These findings suggest that similarities between humans and chimpanzees exist in more than genes alone, but can be seen in emotion, intelligence, and family and social relationships</span>
				<span class='text'>oodall's research at Gombe Stream is best known to the scientific community for challenging two long-standing beliefs of the day: that only humans could construct and use tools, and that chimpanzees were vegetarians</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;PBS&quot; /&gt; While observing one chimpanzee feeding at a termite mound, she watched him repeatedly place stalks of grass into termite holes, then remove them from the hole covered with clinging termites, effectively ‚Äúfishing‚Äù for termites</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The chimps would also take twigs from trees and strip off the leaves to make the twig more effective, a form of object modification which is the rudimentary beginnings of toolmaking</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Chimp&quot; /&gt; Humans had long distinguished ourselves from the rest of the animal kingdom as &quot;Man the Toolmaker&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>In response to Goodall's revolutionary findings, Louis Leakey wrote, &quot;We must now redefine man, redefine tool, or accept chimpanzees as human!&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In contrast to the peaceful and affectionate behaviours she observed, Goodall also found an aggressive side of chimpanzee nature at Gombe Stream</span>
				<span class='text'>She discovered that chimps will systematically hunt and eat smaller primates such as [[colobus]] monkeys</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;PBS&quot; /&gt; Goodall watched a hunting group isolate a colobus monkey high in a tree, block all possible exits, then one chimpanzee climbed up and captured and killed the colobus</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Goodall&quot; /&gt; The others then each took parts of the carcass, sharing with other members of the troop in response to begging behaviours</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Goodall&quot; /&gt; The chimps at Gombe kill and eat as much as one-third of the colobus population in the park each year</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;PBS&quot; /&gt; This alone was a major scientific find which challenged previous conceptions of chimpanzee diet and behaviour</span>
				<span class='text'>ut perhaps more startling, and disturbing, was the tendency for aggression and violence within chimpanzee troops</span>
				<span class='text'>Goodall observed dominant females deliberately killing the young of other females in the troop to maintain their dominance,&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS&quot; /&gt; sometimes going as far as [[cannibalism (zoology)|cannibalism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Chimp&quot; /&gt; She says of this revelation, &quot;During the first ten years of the study I had believed [‚Ä¶] that the Gombe chimpanzees were, for the most part, rather nicer than human beings</span>
				<span class='text'>[‚Ä¶] Then suddenly we found that chimpanzees could be brutal‚Äîthat they, like us, had a darker side to their nature</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chimp&quot; /&gt; She described the 1974‚Äì1978 [[Gombe Chimpanzee War]] in her memoir, ''Through a Window: My Thirty Years with the Chimpanzees of Gombe''</span>
				<span class='text'>Her findings revolutionised contemporary knowledge of chimpanzee behaviour, and were further evidence of the social similarities between humans and chimpanzees, albeit in a much darker manner</span>
				<span class='text'>oodall also set herself apart from the traditional conventions of the time by naming the animals in her studies of primates, instead of assigning each a number</span>
				<span class='text'>Numbering was a nearly universal practice at the time, and thought to be important in the removal of one's self from the potential for emotional attachment to the subject being studied</span>
				<span class='text'>Setting herself apart from other researchers also led her to develop a close bond with the chimpanzees and to become, to this day, the only human ever accepted into chimpanzee society</span>
				<span class='text'> She was the lowest ranking member of a troop for a period of 22 months</span>

				<span class='text'>any standard methods aim to avoid interference by observers, and in particular some believe that the use of feeding stations to attract Gombe chimpanzees has altered normal foraging and feeding patterns and [[social relation]]ships</span>
				<span class='text'>This argument is the focus of a book published by Margaret Power in 1991</span>

				<span class='text'>ISBN 0-521-40016-3</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that higher levels of aggression and conflict with other chimpanzee groups in the area were due to the feeding, which could have created the &quot;wars&quot; between chimpanzee social groups described by Goodall, aspects of which she did not witness in the years before artificial feeding began at Gombe</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, some regard Goodall's observations as distortions of normal chimpanzee behaviour</span>

				<span class='text'>M</span>
				<span class='text'>de Waal, Nature, Sept 2005, &quot;skeptics attributed chimpanzee 'warfare' to competition over the food that researchers provided&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Goodall herself acknowledged that feeding contributed to aggression within and between groups, but maintained that the effect was limited to alteration of the intensity and not the nature of chimpanzee conflict, and further suggested that feeding was necessary for the study to be effective at all</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Craig Stanford]] of the Jane Goodall Research Institute at the [[University of Southern California]] states that researchers conducting studies with no artificial provisioning have a difficult time viewing any social behaviour of chimpanzees, especially those related to intergroup conflict</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Washington University Record, Vol 28 No 28, April 2004</span>
