				<span class='text'>This single strike grew into a general strike and by 7 January 1905 there were 140,000 strikers in Saint Petersburg</span>

				<span class='text'>The peaceful demonstration was fired upon by the Palace Guard resulting in the death of 1,000 demonstrators</span>
				<span class='text'> Thus, Sunday 9 January 1905 became known as [[Bloody Sunday (1905)|Bloody Sunday]]</span>

				<span class='text'>The latter, however, were betrayed by a secret police agent in May, and Trotsky had to flee to rural [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Finland]]</span>

				<span class='text'>On 2 October 1905, the typesetters in printing shops in Saint Petersburg, decided to strike in support of the Moscow strikers</span>

				<span class='text'>He was appointed there to rebuild the rail system ruined by the Civil War</span>
				<span class='text'>Being the Commissar of War and a revolutionary military leader, he saw a need to create a militarized &quot;production atmosphere&quot; by incorporating trade unions directly into the State apparatus</span>
				<span class='text'>His unyielding stance was that in a worker's state the workers should have nothing to fear from the state, and the State should fully control the unions</span>
				<span class='text'>In the Ninth Party Congress he argued for &quot;such a regime under which each worker feels himself to be a soldier of labor who cannot freely dispose of himself; if he is ordered transferred, he must execute that order; if he does not do so, he will be a deserter who should be punished</span>
				<span class='text'>Who will execute this?  The trade union</span>
				<span class='text'>It will create a new regime</span>
				<span class='text'>That is the militarization of the working class</span>

				<span class='text'>His view did not focus on State control as much as the concern that a new relationship was needed between the State and the rank-and-file workers</span>
				<span class='text'>He said, &quot;Introduction of genuine labor discipline is conceived only if the whole mass of participants in productions take a conscious part in the fulfillment of these tasks</span>
				<span class='text'>This cannot be achieved by bureaucratic methods and orders from above</span>

				<span class='text'>In it, he described Zinoviev's and Kamenev's opposition to the Bolshevik seizure of power in 1917, something that the two would have preferred left unmentioned</span>
				<span class='text'>This started a new round of intra-party struggle, which became known as the ''Literary Discussion'', with Zinoviev and Kamenev again allied with Stalin against Trotsky</span>
				<span class='text'>Their criticism of Trotsky was concentrated in three areas:* Trotsky's disagreements and conflicts with Lenin and the Bolsheviks prior to 1917</span>
				<span class='text'> Trotsky's alleged distortion of the events of 1917 in order to emphasize his role and diminish the roles played by other Bolsheviks</span>
				<span class='text'> Trotsky's harsh treatment of his subordinates and other alleged mistakes during the Russian Civil War</span>
				<span class='text'>rotsky was again sick and unable to respond while his opponents mobilized all of their resources to denounce him</span>
				<span class='text'>They succeeded in damaging his military reputation so much that he was forced to resign as People's Commissar of Army and Fleet Affairs and Chairman of the Revolutionary Military Council on 6 January 1925</span>
				<span class='text'>Zinoviev demanded Trotsky's expulsion from the Communist Party, but Stalin refused to go along and played the role of a moderate</span>
				<span class='text'>Trotsky kept his Politburo seat, but was effectively put on probation</span>
				<span class='text'>==A year in the wilderness (1925)===1925 was a difficult year for Trotsky</span>

				<span class='text'>Bukharin and Rykov sided with Stalin while Krupskaya and Soviet Commissar of Finance [[Grigory Sokolnikov]] aligned with Zinoviev and Kamenev</span>
				<span class='text'>The struggle became open at the September 1925 meeting of the Central Committee and came to a head at the [[14th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|XIVth Party Congress]] in December 1925</span>

				<span class='text'>The alliance became known as the &quot;United Opposition&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>he United Opposition was repeatedly threatened with sanctions by the Stalinist leadership of the Communist Party and Trotsky had to agree to tactical retreats, mostly to preserve his alliance with Zinoviev and Kamenev</span>
				<span class='text'>The opposition remained united against [[Stalin]] throughout 1926 and 1927, especially on the issue of the [[Chinese Nationalist Revolution|Chinese Revolution]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The methods used by the Stalinists against the Opposition became more and more extreme</span>
				<span class='text'>At the XVth Party Conference in October 1926 Trotsky could barely speak because of interruptions and catcalls, and at the end of the Conference he lost his Politburo seat</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1927 Stalin started using the [[Gosudarstvennoye Politicheskoye Upravlenie|GPU]] (Soviet secret police) to infiltrate and discredit the opposition</span>
				<span class='text'>Rank and file oppositionists were increasingly harassed, sometimes expelled from the Party and even arrested</span>

				<span class='text'>The Republican government established a new &quot;nationalist people's army and a national people's party—the Kuomintang</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1920, the Kuomintang opened relations with Soviet Russia</span>
				<span class='text'>With Soviet help, the Republic of China built up the nationalist people's army</span>
				<span class='text'>With the development of the nationalist army, a [[Northern Expedition]] was planned to smash the power of the warlords of the northern part of the country</span>
				<span class='text'>This Northern Expedition became a point of contention over foreign policy by Stalin and Trotsky</span>

				<span class='text'>He considered himself an advocate of orthodox Marxism</span>
				<span class='text'>His politics differed in many respects from those of Stalin or [[Mao Zedong]], most importantly in his rejection of the theory of [[Socialism in One Country]] and his declaring the need for an international &quot;[[permanent revolution]]&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Supporters of the Fourth International echo Trotsky's opposition to Stalinist [[totalitarianism]], advocating [[political revolution]], arguing that socialism cannot sustain itself without democracy</span>
				<span class='text'>==Permanent Revolution==={{Main|Permanent Revolution}}Permanent Revolution is the theory that the [[bourgeois]] democratic tasks in countries with delayed bourgeois democratic development can only be accomplished through the establishment of a workers' state, and that the creation of a workers' state would inevitably involve inroads against capitalist property</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, the accomplishment of bourgeois democratic tasks passes over into [[proletarian]] tasks</span>
				<span class='text'>Although most closely associated with Leon Trotsky, the call for Permanent Revolution is first found in the writings of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] in March 1850, in the aftermath of the [[1848 Revolution]], in their [http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|Trotsky, [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Lev Kamenev|Kamenev]] at the Second Party Congress of the Communist Party of Russia in 1919]]Trotsky's conception of Permanent Revolution is based on his understanding, drawing on the work of the founder of Russian Marxism [[Georgy Plekhanov]], that in 'backward' countries the tasks of the Bourgeois Democratic Revolution could not be achieved by the bourgeoisie itself</span>
				<span class='text'>This conception was first developed by Trotsky in collaboration with [[Alexander Parvus]] in late 1904–1905</span>
				<span class='text'>The relevant articles were later collected in Trotsky's books ''1905'' and in ''Permanent Revolution'', which also contains his essay &quot;Results and Prospects&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to Trotskyists, the [[October Revolution]] (which Trotsky directed) was the first example of a successful Permanent Revolution</span>
				<span class='text'>The proletarian, socialist October Revolution took place precisely because the bourgeoisie, which took power in February, had not been able to solve any of the tasks of the bourgeois-democratic revolution</span>
				<span class='text'>It had not given the land to the peasants (which the Bolsheviks did on 25 October), nor given freedom to the oppressed minority nations, nor emancipated Russia from foreign domination by ending the war which, at that point, was fought mainly to please the English and French creditors</span>
