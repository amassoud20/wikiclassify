				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;By the age of 16, Richard had taken command of his own army, putting down rebellions in [[Poitou]] against his father</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Turner &amp; Heiser 71&quot;/&gt; Richard was a central Christian commander during the [[Third Crusade]], leading the campaign after the departure of [[Philip II of France]] and scoring considerable victories against his Muslim counterpart, [[Saladin]], although he did not retake Jerusalem from Saladin</span>

				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Oxford]], [[Kingdom of England|England]], son of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] and [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a younger brother of [[William IX, Count of Poitiers|Count William IX of Poitiers]], [[Henry the Young King]] and [[Matilda of England, Duchess of Saxony|Duchess Matilda of Saxony]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Flori 1999 ix&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Flori|1999|p=ix</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt; As the third legitimate son of King Henry II, he was not expected to ascend the throne</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flori|1999|p=2</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also an elder brother of [[Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany|Duke Geoffrey II of Brittany]]; [[Eleanor of England, Queen of Castile|Queen Eleanor of Castile]]; [[Joan of England, Queen of Sicily|Queen Joan of Sicily]]; and [[John, King of England|Count John of Mortain]], who succeeded him as king</span>
				<span class='text'>Richard was the younger maternal half-brother of [[Marie of France, Countess of Champagne|Countess Marie of Champagne]] and [[Alix of France|Countess Alix of Blois]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Flori 1999 ix&quot;/&gt; The eldest son of Henry II and Eleanor, William, died in 1156, before Richard's birth</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Flori 1999 ix&quot;/&gt; Richard is often depicted as having been the favourite son of his mother</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flori|1999|p=28</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was Norman-Angevin and great-grandson of [[William the Conqueror]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Contemporary historian [[Ralph of Diceto]] traced his family's lineage through [[Matilda of Scotland]] to the [[Anglo-Saxon]] kings of England and [[Alfred the Great]], and from there linked them to [[Noah]] and [[Woden]]</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Angevin legend, there was even infernal blood in the family</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Gillingham 2002 24&quot;/&gt;While his father visited his lands from Scotland to France, Richard probably spent his childhood in England</span>
				<span class='text'>His first recorded visit to the European continent was in May 1165, when his mother took him to Normandy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gillingham, John (1979), p 32</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He was [[wet-nurse]]d by a woman called Hodierna, and when he became king he gave her a generous pension</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gillingham|2002|p=28</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known about Richard's education</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flori|1999|p=10</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was born in Oxford and brought up in England up to his eighth year, it is not known to what extent he used or understood English; he was an educated man who composed poetry and wrote in [[Limousin (dialect)|Limousin]] ([[lenga d'òc]]) and also in French</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leese|1996|p=57</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt; During his captivity, English prejudice against foreigners was used in a calculated way by his brother John to help destroy the authority of Richard's chancellor, [[William Longchamp]], who was a [[Norman people|Norman]]</span>
				<span class='text'>One of the specific charges laid against Longchamp, by John's supporter [[Hugh Nonant|Hugh, Bishop of Coventry]], was that he could not speak English</span>
				<span class='text'>This indicates that by the late 12th century a knowledge of English was expected of those in positions of authority in England</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Richard was said to be very attractive; his hair was between red and blond, and he was light-eyed with a pale complexion</span>
				<span class='text'>He was apparently of above average height: according to Clifford Brewer he was {{convert|6|ft|5|in}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brewer|2000|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As with his supposed lack of English, the question of his stature is one made from a lack of evidence as his remains have been lost since at least the [[French Revolution]], and his exact height is unknown</span>
				<span class='text'>John, his youngest brother (by the same father and mother), was known to be only {{convert|5|ft|5|in}}</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Itinerarium Regis Ricardi|Itinerarium peregrinorum et gesta regis Ricardi]], a Latin prose narrative of the [[Third Crusade]], states that: &quot;He was tall, of elegant build; the colour of his hair was between red and gold; his limbs were supple and straight</span>
				<span class='text'>He had long arms suited to wielding a sword</span>
				<span class='text'>His long legs matched the rest of his body</span>

				<span class='text'>24</span>
				<span class='text'>Random House,&lt;/ref&gt;From an early age he showed significant political and military ability, becoming noted for his [[chivalry]] and courage as he fought to control the rebellious nobles of his own territory</span>
				<span class='text'>His elder brother [[Henry the Young King]] was crowned king of England during his father's lifetime</span>
				<span class='text'>arriage alliances were common among medieval royalty: they led to political alliances and peace treaties, and allowed families to stake claims of succession on each other's lands</span>
				<span class='text'>In March 1159 it was arranged that Richard would marry one of the daughters of [[Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona]]; however, these arrangements failed, and the marriage never took place</span>
				<span class='text'>Henry the Young King was married to Marguerite, daughter of [[Louis VII of France]], on 2 November 1160</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flori|1999|pp=23–25</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this alliance between the Plantagenets and the [[House of Capet|Capetians]], the dynasty on the French throne, the two houses were sometimes in conflict</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1168, the intercession of [[Pope Alexander III]] was necessary to secure a truce between them</span>
				<span class='text'>Henry II had conquered Brittany and taken control of [[Gisors]] and the [[Vexin]], which had been part of Marguerite's dowry</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flori|1999|pp=26–27</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in the 1160s there had been suggestions Richard should marry [[Alys, Countess of the Vexin]] (Alice), fourth daughter of Louis VII; because of the rivalry between the kings of England and France, Louis obstructed the marriage</span>
				<span class='text'>A peace treaty was secured in January 1169 and Richard's betrothal to Alais was confirmed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flori|1999|pp=25, 28</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry II planned to divide his and Queen Eleanor's territories among their three eldest surviving sons: Henry would become King of England and have control of Anjou, Maine, and Normandy; Richard would inherit Aquitaine from his mother and become Count of Poitiers; and Geoffrey would become Duke of Brittany through marriage alliance with Constance, heiress apparent to the region as the daughter, and only child, of [[Conan IV, Duke of Brittany]]</span>
				<span class='text'>At the ceremony where Richard's betrothal was confirmed, he paid homage to the King of France for Aquitaine, thus securing ties of vassalage between the two</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flori|1999|pp=27–28</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt;After Henry II fell seriously ill in 1170, he put in place his plan to divide his kingdom, although he would retain overall authority over his sons and their territories</span>
				<span class='text'> In 1171 Richard left for Aquitaine with his mother, and Henry II gave him the duchy of Aquitaine at the request of Eleanor</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flori|1999|p=29</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard and his mother embarked on a tour of Aquitaine in 1171 in an attempt to pacify the locals</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flori|1999|pp=29–30</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt; Together they laid the foundation stone of St Augustine's Monastery in [[Limoges]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In June 1172 Richard was formally recognised as the Duke of Aquitaine when he was granted the lance and banner emblems of his office; the ceremony took place in Poitiers and was repeated in Limoges, where he wore the ring of [[St Valerie]], who was the personification of Aquitaine</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gillingham|2002|p=40</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt;===Revolt against Henry II==={{Main|Revolt of 1173–74}}According to [[Ralph of Coggeshall]], Henry the Young King instigated rebellion against Henry II; he wanted to reign independently over at least part of the territory his father had promised him, and to break away from his dependence on Henry II, who controlled the purse strings</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flori|1999|pp=31–32</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt; Jean Flori, a historian who specialises in the medieval period, believes that Eleanor manipulated her sons to revolt against their father</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flori|1999|p=32</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt;Henry the Young King abandoned his father and left for the French court, seeking the protection of Louis VII; his younger brothers, Richard and Geoffrey, soon followed him, while the five-year-old John remained in England</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis gave his support to the three sons and even knighted Richard, tying them together through vassalage</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flori|1999|pp=32–33</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Jordan Fantosme]], a contemporary poet, described the rebellion as a &quot;war without love&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gillingham|2002|p=41</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gillingham|2002|pp=49–50</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt;]]The three brothers made an oath at the French court that they would not make terms with Henry II without the consent of Louis VII and the French barons</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Gillingham 2002 48&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Gillingham|2002|p=48</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt; With the support of Louis, Henry the Young King attracted many barons to his cause through promises of land and money; one such baron was [[Philip, Count of Flanders]], who was promised £1,000 and several castles</span>
				<span class='text'>The brothers also had supporters ready to rise up in England</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Robert de Beaumont, 3rd Earl of Leicester]], joined forces with [[Hugh Bigod, 1st Earl of Norfolk]], [[Hugh de Kevelioc, 5th Earl of Chester]], and [[William I of Scotland]] for a rebellion in Suffolk</span>
				<span class='text'>The alliance with Louis was initially successful, and by July 1173 the rebels were [[siege|besieging]] [[Aumale]], [[Neuf-Marché]], and [[Verneuil-sur-Avre|Verneuil]], and Hugh de Kevelioc had captured [[Dol-de-Bretagne|Dol]] in [[Brittany]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Flori 33&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Flori|1999|p=33</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard went to [[Poitou]] and raised the barons who were loyal to himself and his mother in rebellion against his father</span>
				<span class='text'>Eleanor was captured, so Richard was left to lead his campaign against Henry II's supporters in Aquitaine on his own</span>
				<span class='text'>He marched to take [[La Rochelle]] but was rejected by the inhabitants; he withdrew to the city of [[Saintes, Charente-Maritime|Saintes]], which he established as a base of operations</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Flori 34-35&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Flori|1999|pp=34–35</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gillingham|2002|p=49</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt;In the meantime Henry II had raised a very expensive army of more than 20,000 mercenaries with which to face the rebellion</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Flori 33&quot;/&gt; He marched on Verneuil, and Louis retreated from his forces</span>
				<span class='text'>The army proceeded to recapture Dol and subdued Brittany</span>
				<span class='text'>At this point Henry II made an offer of peace to his sons; on the advice of Louis the offer was refused</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Flori 33-34&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Flori|1999|pp=33–34</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry II's forces took Saintes by surprise and captured much of its garrison, although Richard was able to escape with a small group of soldiers</span>
				<span class='text'>He took refuge in [[Château de Taillebourg]] for the rest of the war</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Flori 34-35&quot;/&gt; Henry the Young King and the Count of Flanders planned to land in England to assist the rebellion led by the Earl of Leicester</span>
				<span class='text'>Anticipating this, Henry II returned to England with 500 soldiers and his prisoners (including Eleanor and his sons' wives and fiancées),&lt;ref name=&quot;Flori 35&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Flori|1999|p=35</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt; but on his arrival found out that the rebellion had already collapsed</span>
				<span class='text'>William I of Scotland and Hugh Bigod were captured on 13 and 25 July respectively</span>
				<span class='text'>Henry II returned to France and raised the siege of [[Rouen]], where Louis VII had been joined by Henry the Young King after abandoning his plan to invade England</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis was defeated and a peace treaty was signed in September 1174,&lt;ref name=&quot;Flori 33-34&quot;/&gt; the Treaty of Montlouis</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gillingham|2002|pp=50–51</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt;When Henry II and Louis VII made a truce on 8 September 1174, its terms specifically excluded Richard</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Flori 35&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillingham 2002 50&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Gillingham|2002|p=50</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt; Abandoned by Louis and wary of facing his father's army in battle, Richard went to Henry II's court at Poitiers on 23 September and begged for forgiveness, weeping and falling at the feet of Henry, who gave Richard the [[Holy kiss|kiss of peace]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Flori 35&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillingham 2002 50&quot;/&gt; Several days later, Richard's brothers joined him in seeking reconciliation with their father</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Flori 35&quot;/&gt; The terms the three brothers accepted were less generous than those they had been offered earlier in the conflict (when Richard was offered four castles in Aquitaine and half of the income from the duchy):&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillingham 2002 48&quot;/&gt; Richard was given control of two castles in Poitou and half the income of Aquitaine; Henry the Young King was given two castles in Normandy; and Geoffrey was permitted half of [[Brittany]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Eleanor remained Henry II's prisoner until his death, partly as insurance for Richard's good behaviour</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flori|1999|p=36</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt;===Final years of Henry II's reign===[[File:Richard I pictavinus 722697</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|A silver [[French denier|denier]] of Richard, struck in his capacity as the Count of Poitiers]]After the conclusion of the war, the process of pacifying the provinces that had rebelled against Henry II began</span>
				<span class='text'>The King travelled to Anjou for this purpose, and Geoffrey dealt with Brittany</span>
				<span class='text'>In January 1175 Richard was dispatched to Aquitaine to punish the barons who had fought for him</span>
				<span class='text'>The historian [[John Gillingham]] notes that the chronicle of [[Roger of Hoveden|Roger of Howden]] is the main source for Richard's activities in this period</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Gillingham 2002 52&quot;/&gt; According to the chronicle, most of the castles belonging to rebels were to be returned to the state they were in 15&amp;nbsp;days before the outbreak of war, while others were to be razed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Gillingham 2002 52&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Gillingham|2002|p=52</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that by this time it was common for castles to be built in stone, and that many barons had expanded or refortified their castles, this was not an easy task</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Flori 41&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Flori|p=41</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt; Roger of Howden records the two-month siege of [[Castillon-sur-Agen]]; while the castle was &quot;notoriously strong&quot;, Richard's siege engines battered the defenders into submission</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flori|pp=41–42</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt; On this campaign Richard acquired the name &quot;Richard the Lionheart&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Flori 41&quot;/&gt;Henry seemed unwilling to entrust any of his sons with resources that could be used against him</span>
				<span class='text'>It was suspected that Henry had appropriated [[Alys, Countess of the Vexin|Princess Alys]], Richard's betrothed, the daughter of [[Louis VII of France]] by his second wife, as his [[mistress (lover)|mistress]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This made a marriage between Richard and Alys technically impossible in the eyes of the [[Catholicism|Church]], but Henry prevaricated: he regarded Alys's [[dowry]], [[Vexin]] in the [[Île-de-France]], as valuable</span>
				<span class='text'>Richard was discouraged from renouncing Alys because she was the sister of King [[Philip II of France]], a close ally</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}After his failure to overthrow his father, Richard concentrated on putting down internal revolts by the nobles of Aquitaine, especially in the territory of [[Gascony]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The increasing cruelty of his rule led to a major revolt there in 1179</span>
				<span class='text'>Hoping to dethrone Richard, the rebels sought the help of his brothers Henry and Geoffrey</span>
				<span class='text'>The turning point came in the [[Charente|Charente Valley]] in the spring of 1179</span>
				<span class='text'>The well-defended [[Château de Taillebourg|fortress of Taillebourg]] seemed impregnable</span>
				<span class='text'>The castle was surrounded by a cliff on three sides and a town on the fourth side with a three-layer wall</span>
				<span class='text'>Richard first destroyed and looted the farms and lands surrounding the fortress, leaving its defenders no reinforcements or lines of retreat</span>
				<span class='text'>The garrison sallied out of the castle and attacked Richard; he was able to subdue the army and then followed the defenders inside the open gates, where he easily took over the castle in two days</span>
				<span class='text'>Richard the Lionheart's victory at Taillebourg deterred many barons from thinking of rebelling and forced them to declare their loyalty to him</span>

				<span class='text'>n 1181–1182 Richard faced a revolt over the succession to the county of [[Angoulême]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His opponents turned to Philip II of France for support, and the fighting spread through the [[Limousin (province)|Limousin]] and [[Périgord]]</span>

				<span class='text'>fter Richard had subdued his rebellious barons he again challenged his father</span>
				<span class='text'>From 1180 to 1183 the tension between Henry and Richard grew, as King Henry commanded Richard to pay homage to Henry the Young King, but Richard refused</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally, in 1183 Henry the Young King and Geoffrey, Duke of Brittany, invaded Aquitaine in an attempt to subdue Richard</span>
				<span class='text'>Richard's barons joined in the fray and turned against their duke</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Richard and his army succeeded in holding back the invading armies, and they executed any prisoners</span>
				<span class='text'>The conflict paused briefly in June 1183 when the Young King died</span>
				<span class='text'>With the death of Henry the Young King, Richard became the eldest surviving son and therefore heir to the English crown</span>
				<span class='text'>King Henry demanded that Richard give up Aquitaine (which he planned to give to his youngest son John as his inheritance)</span>
				<span class='text'>Richard refused, and conflict continued between them</span>
				<span class='text'>Henry II soon gave John permission to invade Aquitaine</span>
				<span class='text'>o strengthen his position, in 1187, Richard allied himself with 22-year-old Philip II, the son of Eleanor's ex-husband Louis VII by [[Adele of Champagne]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Roger of Howden wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;The King of England was struck with great astonishment, and wondered what [this alliance] could mean, and, taking precautions for the future, frequently sent messengers into France for the purpose of recalling his son Richard; who, pretending that he was peaceably inclined and ready to come to his father, made his way to [[Chinon]], and, in spite of the person who had the custody thereof, carried off the greater part of his father's treasures, and fortified his castles in Poitou with the same, refusing to go to his father</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;flori138&quot;/&gt;===Marriage===Before leaving Cyprus  on crusade, Richard married [[Berengaria of Navarre]], first-born daughter of King [[Sancho VI of Navarre]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Abbott, Jacob, History of King Richard the First of England, Harper &amp; Brothers 1877&lt;/ref&gt;  The wedding was held in Limassol on 12 May 1191 at the Chapel of St</span>
				<span class='text'>George and was attended by Richard's sister Joan, whom he had brought from Sicily</span>
				<span class='text'>The marriage was celebrated with great pomp and splendour, many feasts and entertainments, and public parades and celebrations followed commemorating the event</span>
				<span class='text'>Among the other grand ceremonies was a double coronation</span>
				<span class='text'>Richard caused himself to be crowned King of Cyprus, and Berengaria Queen of England and of Cyprus, too</span>
				<span class='text'> When Richard married Berengaria he was still officially betrothed to Alys, and he pushed for the match in order to obtain the [[Kingdom of Navarre]] as a fief, as Aquitaine had been for his father</span>
				<span class='text'>Further, Eleanor championed the match, as Navarre bordered Aquitaine, thereby securing the southern border of her ancestral lands</span>
				<span class='text'>Richard took his new wife on crusade with him briefly, though they returned separately</span>

				<span class='text'>1250–60]]King Richard landed at [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] on 8 June 1191</span>
				<span class='text'>He gave his support to his [[Poitou|Poitevin]] [[vassal]] [[Guy of Lusignan]], who had brought troops to help him in Cyprus</span>
				<span class='text'>Guy was the widower of his father's cousin [[Sibylla of Jerusalem]] and was trying to retain the kingship of Jerusalem, despite his wife's death during the [[Siege of Acre (1189–1191)|Siege of Acre]] the previous year</span>
				<span class='text'>Guy's claim was challenged by [[Conrad of Montferrat]], second husband of Sibylla's half-sister, [[Isabella of Jerusalem|Isabella]]: Conrad, whose defence of Tyre had saved the kingdom in 1187, was supported by Philip of France, son of his first cousin [[Louis VII of France]], and by another cousin, Duke [[Leopold V of Austria (Babenberg)|Leopold V of Austria]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Richard also allied with [[Humphrey IV of Toron]], Isabella's first husband, from whom she had been forcibly divorced in 1190</span>
				<span class='text'>Humphrey was loyal to Guy and spoke Arabic fluently, so Richard used him as a translator and negotiator</span>
				<span class='text'>ichard and his forces aided in the capture of Acre, despite the king's serious illness</span>
				<span class='text'>At one point, while sick from [[scurvy]], Richard is said to have picked off guards on the walls with a [[crossbow]], while being carried on a stretcher</span>
				<span class='text'>Eventually Conrad of Montferrat concluded the surrender negotiations with Saladin's forces inside Acre and raised the banners of the kings in the city</span>
				<span class='text'>Richard quarrelled with [[Leopold V, Duke of Austria|Leopold V of Austria]] over the deposition of [[Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus|Isaac Komnenos]] (related to Leopold's [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] mother) and his position within the crusade</span>
				<span class='text'>Leopold's banner had been raised alongside the English and French standards</span>
				<span class='text'>This was interpreted as arrogance by both Richard and Philip, as Leopold was a vassal of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] (although he was the highest-ranking surviving leader of the imperial forces)</span>
				<span class='text'>Richard's men tore the flag down and threw it in the moat of Acre</span>
				<span class='text'>Leopold left the [[Third Crusade|crusade]] immediately</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip also left soon afterwards, in poor health and after further disputes with Richard over the status of Cyprus (Philip demanded half the island) and the kingship of Jerusalem</span>
				<span class='text'>Richard, suddenly, found himself without allies</span>
				<span class='text'>ichard had kept 2,700 Muslim prisoners as hostages against Saladin fulfilling all the terms of the surrender of the lands around Acre</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip, before leaving, had entrusted his prisoners to Conrad, but Richard forced him to hand them over to him</span>
				<span class='text'>Richard feared his forces being bottled up in Acre as he believed his campaign could not advance with the prisoners in train</span>
				<span class='text'>He therefore ordered [[Massacre at Ayyadieh|all the prisoners executed]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He then moved south, defeating [[Saladin]]'s forces at the [[Battle of Arsuf]] {{convert|30|mi|km|-1}} north of Jaffa on 7 September 1191</span>
				<span class='text'>Saladin attempted to harass Richard's army into breaking its formation in order to defeat it in detail</span>
				<span class='text'>Richard maintained his army's defensive formation, however, until the [[Hospitallers]] broke ranks to charge the right wing of Saladin's forces</span>
				<span class='text'>Richard then ordered a general counterattack, which won the battle</span>
				<span class='text'>Arsuf was an important victory</span>
				<span class='text'>The Muslim army was not destroyed, despite the considerable casualties it suffered, but it did rout; this was considered shameful by the Muslims and boosted the morale of the Crusaders</span>
				<span class='text'>In November 1191, following the fall of [[Jaffa]], the Crusader army advanced inland towards Jerusalem</span>
				<span class='text'>The army then marched to Beit Nuba, only 12 miles from Jerusalem</span>
				<span class='text'>Muslim morale in Jerusalem was so low that the arrival of the Crusaders would probably have caused the city to fall quickly</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the weather was appallingly bad, cold with heavy rain and hailstorms; this, combined with the fear that the Crusader army, if it besieged Jerusalem, might be trapped by a relieving force, led to the decision to retreat back to the coast</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gillingham (1979), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;198–200</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Richard attempted to negotiate with Saladin, but this was unsuccessful</span>
				<span class='text'>In the first half of 1192 he and his troops refortified [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n election forced Richard to accept Conrad of Montferrat as King of Jerusalem, and he sold Cyprus to his defeated protégé, Guy</span>
				<span class='text'>Only days later, on 28 April 1192, Conrad was stabbed to death by [[Hashshashin]] (Assassins) before he could be crowned</span>
				<span class='text'>Eight days later Richard's own nephew [[Henry II of Champagne]] was married to the widowed [[Isabella of Jerusalem|Isabella]], although she was carrying Conrad's child</span>
				<span class='text'>The murder has never been conclusively solved, and Richard's contemporaries widely suspected his involvement</span>
				<span class='text'>he Crusader army made another advance on Jerusalem, and in June 1192 it came within sight of the city before being forced to retreat once again, this time because of dissension amongst its leaders</span>
				<span class='text'>In particular, Richard and the majority of the army council wanted to force Saladin to relinquish Jerusalem by attacking the basis of his power through an invasion of [[Egypt]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The leader of the French contingent, the [[Hugh III, Duke of Burgundy|Duke of Burgundy]], however, was adamant that a direct attack on Jerusalem should be made</span>
				<span class='text'>This split the Crusader army into two factions, and neither was strong enough to achieve its objective</span>
				<span class='text'>Richard stated that he would accompany any attack on Jerusalem but only as a simple soldier; he refused to lead the army</span>
				<span class='text'>Without a united command the army had little choice but to retreat back to the coast</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gillingham (1979), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;209–212&lt;/ref&gt;There commenced a period of minor skirmishes with Saladin's forces, punctuated by another defeat in the field for the Ayyubid army at the [[Battle of Jaffa (1192)|Battle of Jaffa]], while Richard and Saladin negotiated a settlement to the conflict</span>
				<span class='text'>Both sides realised that their respective positions were growing untenable</span>
				<span class='text'>Richard knew that both Philip and his own brother [[John, King of England|John]] were starting to plot against him, and the morale of Saladin's army had been badly eroded by repeated defeats</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Saladin insisted on the razing of Ascalon's fortifications, which Richard's men had rebuilt, and a few other points</span>
				<span class='text'>Richard made one last attempt to strengthen his bargaining position by attempting to invade [[Egypt]]—Saladin's chief supply-base—but failed</span>
				<span class='text'>In the end, time ran out for Richard</span>
				<span class='text'>He realised that his return could be postponed no longer since both Philip and John were taking advantage of his absence</span>
				<span class='text'>He and Saladin finally came to a settlement on 2 September 1192</span>
				<span class='text'>The terms provided for the destruction of Ascalon's fortifications, allowed Christian [[pilgrim]]s and [[merchants]] access to Jerusalem, and initiated a three-year truce</span>

				<span class='text'>1196]]Bad weather forced Richard's ship to put in at [[Corfu]], in the lands of the Byzantine Emperor [[Isaac II Angelos]], who objected to Richard's annexation of Cyprus, formerly Byzantine territory</span>
				<span class='text'>Disguised as a [[Knights Templar|Knight Templar]], Richard sailed from Corfu with four attendants, but his ship was wrecked near [[Aquileia]], forcing Richard and his party into a dangerous land route through central Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>On his way to the territory of his brother-in-law [[Henry the Lion]], Richard was captured shortly before Christmas 1192 near [[Vienna]] by [[Leopold V, Duke of Austria]], who accused Richard of arranging the murder of his cousin [[Conrad of Montferrat]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, Richard had personally offended Leopold by casting down his standard from the walls of Acre</span>
				<span class='text'>uke Leopold kept him prisoner at [[Dürnstein|Dürnstein Castle]] under the care of Leopold's [[ministeriales|ministerialis]] Hadmar of Kuenring</span>

				<span class='text'>While in prison, Richard wrote ''Ja nus hons pris'' or ''Ja nuls om pres'' (&quot;No man who is imprisoned&quot;), which is addressed to his half-sister [[Marie de Champagne]]</span>
				<span class='text'> He wrote the song, in French and [[Occitan]] versions, to express his feelings of abandonment by his people and his sister</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|Ruins of [[Dürnstein|Dürnstein Castle]], where Richard was kept captive]]On 28 March 1193 Richard was brought to [[Speyer]] and handed over to [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor]], who imprisoned him in [[Trifels Castle]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Henry VI was aggrieved by the support the [[Plantagenet]]s had given to the family of [[Henry the Lion]] and by Richard's recognition of Tancred in Sicily</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;eb1911&quot;/&gt; Henry VI needed money to raise an army and assert his rights over southern Italy and continued to hold Richard for ransom</span>
				<span class='text'> In response Pope Celestine III excommunicated Henry VI, as he had Duke Leopold, for the continued wrongful imprisonment of Richard</span>
				<span class='text'>Richard famously refused to show deference to the emperor and declared to him, &quot;[[s:I am born in a rank which recognizes no superior but God|I am born of a rank which recognises no superior but God]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Longford|1989|p=85</span>

				<span class='text'>[[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] worked to raise the ransom</span>
				<span class='text'>Both clergy and laymen were taxed for a quarter of the value of their property, the gold and silver treasures of the churches were confiscated, and money was raised from the [[scutage]] and the [[carucage]] taxes</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time, John, Richard's brother, and King Philip of France offered {{Formatnum:80000}} marks for the Emperor to hold Richard prisoner until [[Michaelmas]] 1194</span>
				<span class='text'>The emperor turned down the offer</span>
				<span class='text'>The money to rescue the King was transferred to Germany by the emperor's ambassadors, but &quot;at the king's peril&quot; (had it been lost along the way, Richard would have been held responsible), and finally, on 4 February 1194 Richard was released</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gillingham|2004}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Richard forgave John when they met again and named him as his heir in place of their nephew, Arthur</span>
				<span class='text'>ichard began his reconquest of Normandy</span>
				<span class='text'>The fall of the [[Château de Gisors]] to the French in 1196 opened a gap in the Norman defences</span>
				<span class='text'>The search began for a fresh site for a new castle to defend the duchy of Normandy and act as a base from which Richard could launch his campaign to take back the [[Vexin]] from French control</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gillingham|2002|pp=303–305</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt; A naturally defensible position was identified perched high above the River [[Seine]], an important transport route, in the [[manorialism|manor]] of [[Andeli]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Louviers]] (December 1195) between Richard and Philip II, neither king was allowed to fortify the site; despite this, Richard intended to build the vast [[Château Gaillard]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Gillingham 301&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Gillingham|2002|p=301</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard tried to obtain the manor through negotiation</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Walter de Coutances]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Rouen|Archbishop of Rouen]], was reluctant to sell the manor as it was one of the diocese's most profitable, and other lands belonging to the diocese had recently been damaged by war</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Gillingham 301&quot;/&gt; When Philip [[siege|besieged]] [[Aumale]] in Normandy, Richard grew tired of waiting and seized the manor,&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillingham 301&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|1997|p=10</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt; although the act was opposed by the [[Catholic Church|Church]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Packard|1922|p=20</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt; Walter de Coutances issued an [[interdict]] against the [[duchy of Normandy]] prohibiting church services from being performed in the region</span>
				<span class='text'>Roger of Howden detailed &quot;the unburied bodies of the dead lying in the streets and square of the cities of Normandy&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Construction began with the interdict hanging over Normandy, but it was later repealed in April 1197 by [[Pope Celestine III]], after Richard made gifts of land to Walter de Coutances and the diocese of Rouen, including two manors and the prosperous port of [[Dieppe]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Gillingham 302&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Gillingham|2002|pp=302–304}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allen Brown|2004|p=112</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt;Royal expenditure on castles declined from the levels spent under Henry II, attributed to a concentration of resources on Richard's war with the king of France</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allen Brown|1955|pp=355–356</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the work at [[Château Gaillard]] was some of the most expensive of its time and cost an estimated £15,000 to £20,000 between 1196 and 1198</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;McNeil 42&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|McNeill|1992|p=42</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt; This was more than double Richard's spending on castles in England, an estimated £7,000</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gillingham|2002|p=304</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt; Unprecedented in its speed of construction, the castle was mostly complete in just two years, when most construction on such a scale would have taken the best part of a decade</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;McNeil 42&quot;/&gt; According to [[William of Newburgh]], in May 1198 Richard and the labourers working on the castle were drenched in a &quot;rain of blood&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>While some of his advisers thought the rain was an evil omen, Richard was undeterred</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Gillingham 2002 303&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Gillingham|2002|p=303</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt;As no master-mason is mentioned in the otherwise detailed records of the castle's construction, military historian Allen Brown has suggested that Richard himself was the overall architect; this is supported by the interest Richard showed in the work through his frequent presence</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allen Brown|2004|p=113</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt; In his final years, the castle became Richard's favourite residence, and writs and charters were written at Château Gaillard bearing &quot;''apud Bellum Castrum de Rupe''&quot; (at the Fair Castle of the Rock)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Allen Brown 62&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Allen Brown|1976|p=62</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt; Château Gaillard was ahead of its time, featuring innovations that would be adopted in castle architecture nearly a century later</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Allen Brown 62&quot;/&gt; Richard later boasted that he could hold the castle &quot;were the walls made of butter&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oman|1991|p=32</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt; Allen Brown described Château Gaillard as &quot;one of the finest castles in Europe&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen Brown 62&quot;/&gt; and military historian Sir [[Charles Oman]] wrote that:{{quote|Château Gaillard&amp;nbsp;</span>

				<span class='text'>Even a [[blood rain|rain of blood]]&amp;nbsp;– considered a bad omen&amp;nbsp;– did not dissuade Richard from building his vast and expensive fortress in Normandy</span>
				<span class='text'>}Determined to resist Philip's designs on contested Angevin lands such as the Vexin and Berry, Richard poured all his military expertise and vast resources into war on the French King</span>
				<span class='text'>He organised an alliance against Philip, including [[Baldwin IX of Flanders]], Renaud, Count of Boulogne, and his father-in-law King [[Sancho VI of Navarre]], who raided Philip's lands from the south</span>
				<span class='text'>Most importantly, he managed to secure the [[House of Welf|Welf]] inheritance in Saxony for his nephew, [[Henry the Lion]]'s son Otto of Poitou, who was elected [[Otto IV of Germany]] in 1198</span>
				<span class='text'>artly as a result of these and other intrigues, Richard won several victories over Philip</span>
				<span class='text'>At [[Fréteval]] in 1194, just after Richard's return to France from captivity and money-raising in England, Philip fled, leaving his entire archive of financial audits and documents to be captured by Richard</span>
				<span class='text'>At the [[Battle of Gisors]] (sometimes called Courcelles) in 1198, Richard took &quot;Dieu et mon Droit&quot;—&quot;God and my Right&quot;—as his motto (still used by the [[British monarchy]] today), echoing his earlier boast to the Emperor Henry that his rank acknowledged no superior but God</span>
				<span class='text'>n March 1199, Richard was in the [[History of Limousin|Limousin]] suppressing a revolt by Viscount [[Aimar V of Limoges]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Although it was [[Lent]], he &quot;devastated the Viscount's land with fire and sword&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|200|Tomb containing the heart of King Richard at [[Rouen Cathedral]]|Tomb at Fontevraud}}In the early evening of 25 March 1199, Richard was walking around the castle perimeter without his chainmail, investigating the progress of [[sapper]]s on the castle walls</span>
				<span class='text'>Missiles were occasionally shot from the castle walls, but these were given little attention</span>
				<span class='text'>One defender in particular amused the king greatly—a man standing on the walls, crossbow in one hand, the other clutching a frying pan he had been using all day as a shield to beat off missiles</span>
				<span class='text'>He deliberately aimed at the king, which the king applauded; however, another crossbowman then struck the king in the left shoulder near the neck</span>
				<span class='text'>He tried to pull this out in the privacy of his tent but failed; a surgeon, called a &quot;butcher&quot; by Howden, removed it, &quot;carelessly mangling&quot; the King's arm in the process</span>
				<span class='text'>The wound swiftly became [[gangrene|gangrenous]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Accordingly, Richard asked to have the crossbowman brought before him; called alternatively Pierre (or Peter) Basile, John Sabroz, Dudo,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gillingham|1989|p=16</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flori|1999 (French)|pp=233–254</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bertrand de Gourdon (from the town of Gourdon) by chroniclers, the man turned out (according to some sources, but not all) to be a boy</span>
				<span class='text'>This boy claimed that Richard had killed the boy's father and two brothers, and that he had killed Richard in revenge</span>
				<span class='text'>The boy expected to be executed; Richard, as a last act of mercy, forgave him, saying, &quot;Live on, and by my bounty behold the light of day,&quot; before ordering that the boy be freed and sent away with 100 [[shilling]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Although there are numerous variations of the story's details, it is not disputed that Richard did pardon the person who shot the bolt, see {{harvnb|Flori|1999 (French)|p=234</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt;  Richard then set his affairs in order, bequeathing all his territory to his brother John and his jewels to his nephew [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ichard died on 6 April 1199 in the arms of his mother; it was later said that &quot;As the day was closing, he ended his earthly day</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Because of the nature of Richard's death, he was later referred to as &quot;the Lion (that) by the Ant was slain&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>According to one chronicler, Richard's last act of chivalry proved fruitless when the infamous [[mercenary]] captain [[Mercadier]] had the crossbowman [[flaying|flayed alive]] and [[hanging|hanged]] as soon as Richard died</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flori|1999 (French)|p=238</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt;Richard's heart was buried at [[Rouen]] in Normandy, his entrails in [[Châlus]] (where he died), and the rest of his body at the feet of his father at [[Fontevraud Abbey]] in Anjou</span>

				<span class='text'>The story was the basis of [[André Ernest Modeste Grétry]]'s opera ''Richard Coeur-de-Lion'' and seems to be the inspiration for the opening to [[Richard Thorpe]]'s film version of ''[[Ivanhoe (1952 film)|Ivanhoe]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>It seems unconnected to the real Jean 'Blondel' de Nesle, an aristocratic [[trouvère]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It also does not correspond to the historical reality, since the king's jailers did not hide the fact; on the contrary, they publicised it</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flori|1999 (French)|p=192</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt;At some time around the 16th century, tales of [[Robin Hood]] started to mention him as a contemporary and supporter of King Richard the Lionheart, Robin being driven to outlawry, during the misrule of Richard's evil brother John, while Richard was away at the Third Crusade</span>

				<span class='text'>Victorian and Edwardian historians had rarely addressed this question, but in 1948 historian John Harvey challenged what he perceived as &quot;the conspiracy of silence&quot; surrounding Richard's [[homosexuality]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This argument drew primarily on available chronicler accounts of Richard's behaviour, chronicler records of Richard's two public confessions and penitences, and Richard's childless marriage</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Summarised in McLynn, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>2–3</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger of Hoveden|Roger of Howden]] tells of a hermit who warned, &quot;Be thou mindful of the destruction of Sodom, and abstain from what is unlawful&quot;, and Richard thus &quot;receiving absolution, took back his wife, whom for a long time he had not known, and putting away all illicit intercourse, he remained constant to his wife and the two become one flesh</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; but has been disputed by other historians, most notably John Gillingham</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Gillingham 1994 119–139</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Gillingham|1994|pp=119–139</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on other chronicler accounts, he argues that Richard was probably heterosexual</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Gillingham 1994 119–139</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;/&gt; Historian Jean Flori claims that contemporary historians{{who?|date=January 2016}} generally accept that Richard was predominantly homosexual</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Flori, this change is due to greater social acceptance of homosexuality</span>
				<span class='text'>Flori also analysed contemporaneous accounts; he attempts to refute Gillingham's arguments and concluded that Richard's two public [[Confession (religion)|confessions]] and [[penitence]]s (in 1191 and 1195) 'must' have referred to the &quot;sin of [[sodomy]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flori|1999 (French)|pp=456–462</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt; Flori cites contemporaneous accounts of Richard taking women by force&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flori|1999 (French)|p=463</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt; and concludes that Richard probably had sexual relations with both men and women at different stages</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flori|1999 (French)|p=464</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt; Flori and Gillingham nevertheless agree that contemporaneous accounts do not support the suggestion that Richard had a sexual relationship with King Philip II, as suggested by some modern authors</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flori|1999 (French)|pp=454–456</span>
				<span class='text'>Contemporaneous accounts refer to various signs of friendship between the two when Richard was at Philip's court in 1187 during his rebellion against his father Henry II, including sleeping in the same bed</span>
				<span class='text'>But, according to Flori and Gillingham, such signs of friendship were part of the customs of the time and cannot be interpreted as indicating homosexuality of either man</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt;===Modern fiction===Richard appears as a major or minor character in many works of fiction, both written and audio-visual</span>
				<span class='text'> As noted above, Richard appears in connection with [[Robin Hood]] in [[Sir Walter Scott]]'s novel ''[[Ivanhoe]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>He is one of the main characters in Scott's ''[[The Talisman (Scott novel)|The Talisman]]'', set during the [[Third Crusade]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He appears in many other fictional accounts of the Third Crusade and its sequel, for example [[Graham Shelby]]'s ''The Kings of Vain Intent'' and ''The Devil is Loose''</span>
				<span class='text'>Richard is a major character in [[Norah Lofts]]' novel ''The Lute Player'', in [[Martha Rofheart]]'s ''Lionheart!: A Novel of Richard I, King of England'', in [[Cecelia Holland]]'s ''The King's Witch, ''[[Gore Vidal]]'s ''A Search For the King'' and in [[Sharon Kay Penman]]'s ''[[Devil's Brood|The Devil's Brood]]'' and ''Lionheart''</span>
				<span class='text'>He also appears in three of [[Angus Donald]]'s ''Outlaw Chronicles'' series of novels based on the legend of [[Robin Hood]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The opera [[Riccardo Primo]] by [[George Frideric Handel]] is based on Richard's invasion of Cyprus</span>
				<span class='text'>Richard is a major character in [[James Goldman]]'s ''[[The Lion in Winter]]'', which references the alleged homosexual affair between Richard and [[Philip II of France]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Lord Darcy (character)|Lord Darcy]] stories by science fiction writer [[Randall Garrett]] depict an [[alternate history]] in which Richard survived [[Chaluz]] and went on to defeat and dethrone the [[Capetian]]s, make himself and his successors Kings of France as well as of England, and establish a [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet]] Empire enduring into the 20th century</span>
