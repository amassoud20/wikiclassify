				<span class='text'>These men and women are associated with over two thousand Roman Catholic, Anglican, and ecumenical Benedictine monasteries on six continents</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt;Benedict's main achievement is his &quot;[[Rule of Saint Benedict]]&quot;, containing [[precepts]] for his monks</span>
				<span class='text'>It is heavily influenced by the writings of [[John Cassian]], and shows strong affinity with the [[Rule of the Master]]</span>
				<span class='text'>But it also has a unique spirit of balance, moderation and reasonableness (ἐπιείκεια, ''epieikeia''), and this persuaded most religious communities founded throughout the Middle Ages to adopt it</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, his Rule became one of the most influential religious rules in Western [[Christendom]]</span>
				<span class='text'>For this reason, Benedict is often called the founder of western monasticism</span>
				<span class='text'>=Biography==Apart from a short poem attributed to Mark of Monte Cassino, the only ancient account of Benedict is found in the second volume of [[Pope Gregory I]]'s four-book ''[[Dialogues]]'', thought to have been written in 593</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=ford/&gt; The authenticity of this work has been hotly disputed, especially by Dr Francis Clarke in his two volume work ''The Pseudo-Gregorian Dialogues''</span>
				<span class='text'>Book Two consists of a prologue and thirty-eight succinct chapters</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Life and Miracles of St</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Gregory’s account of this saint’s life is not, however, a biography in the modern sense of the word</span>
				<span class='text'>It provides instead a [[Hagiography|spiritual portrait]] of the gentle, disciplined abbot</span>
				<span class='text'>In a letter to Bishop Maximilian of Syracuse, Gregory states his intention for his ''Dialogues'', saying they are a kind of ''floretum'' (an ''anthology'', literally, 'flowers') of the most striking miracles of Italian holy men</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Gregory did not set out to write a chronological, historically anchored story of St</span>
				<span class='text'>Benedict, but he did base his anecdotes on direct testimony</span>
				<span class='text'>To establish his authority, Gregory explains that his information came from what he considered the best sources: a handful of Benedict’s disciples who lived with the saint and witnessed his various miracles</span>
				<span class='text'>These followers, he says, are Constantinus, who succeeded Benedict as [[Abbot]] of Monte Cassino; Valentinianus; Simplicius; and Honoratus, who was abbot of Subiaco when St Gregory wrote his ''Dialogues''</span>
				<span class='text'>n Gregory's day, history was not recognised as an independent field of study; it was a branch of grammar or rhetoric, and ''historia'' (defined as 'story') summed up the approach of the learned when they wrote what was, at that time, considered 'history</span>

				<span class='text'>St Gregory's narrative makes it impossible to suppose him younger than 19 or 20 at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>He was old enough to be in the midst of his literary studies, to understand the real meaning and worth of the dissolute and licentious lives of his companions, and to have been deeply affected himself by the love of a woman</span>

				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt; Enfide, which the tradition of Subiaco identifies with the modern [[Affile]], is in the [[Monti Simbruini|Simbruini]] mountains, about forty miles from Rome and two from Subiaco</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|200px|left|St Benedict orders [[Saint Maurus]] to the rescue of [[Saint Placidus]], by [[Fra Filippo Lippi]], 1445 A</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>]A short distance from Enfide is the entrance to a narrow, gloomy valley, penetrating the mountains and leading directly to Subiaco</span>
				<span class='text'>The path continues to ascend, and the side of the ravine, on which it runs, becomes steeper, until a cave is reached above which the mountain now rises almost perpendicularly; while on the right, it strikes in a rapid descent down to where, in St Benedict's day, {{convert|500|ft|m}} below, lay the blue waters of the lake</span>
				<span class='text'>The cave has a large triangular-shaped opening and is about ten feet deep</span>
				<span class='text'>n his way from Enfide, Benedict met a monk, [[Romanus of Subiaco]], whose monastery was on the mountain above the cliff overhanging the cave</span>
				<span class='text'>Romanus had discussed with Benedict the purpose which had brought him to Subiaco, and had given him the monk's habit</span>
				<span class='text'>By his advice Benedict became a hermit and for three years, unknown to men, lived in this cave above the lake</span>
				<span class='text'>One day, the Devil brought before his imagination a beautiful woman he had formerly known, inflaming his heart with strong desire for her</span>
				<span class='text'>Immediately, Benedict stripped off his clothes and rolled into a thorn-bush until his body was lacerated</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, through the wounds of the body, he cured the wounds of his soul</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=SHMI /&gt;==Later life==St Gregory tells us little of these years</span>
				<span class='text'>He now speaks of Benedict no longer as a youth (''puer''), but as a man (''vir'') of God</span>
				<span class='text'>Romanus, he twice tells us, served the saint in every way he could</span>
				<span class='text'>The monk apparently visited him frequently, and on fixed days brought him food</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|right]] --&gt;During these three years of solitude, broken only by occasional communications with the outer world and by the visits of Romanus, Benedict matured both in mind and character, in knowledge of himself and of his fellow-man, and at the same time he became not merely known to, but secured the respect of, those about him; so much so that on the death of the abbot of a monastery in the neighbourhood (identified by some with [[Vicovaro]]), the community came to him and begged him to become its abbot</span>
				<span class='text'>Benedict was acquainted with the life and discipline of the monastery, and knew that &quot;their manners were diverse from his and therefore that they would never agree together: yet, at length, overcome with their entreaty, he gave his consent&quot; (ibid</span>
				<span class='text'> 3)</span>
				<span class='text'>The experiment failed; the monks tried to poison him</span>
				<span class='text'>The legend goes that they first tried to poison his drink</span>
				<span class='text'>He prayed a blessing over the cup and the cup shattered</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus he left the group and went back to his cave at Subiaco</span>
				<span class='text'>There lived in the neighborhood a priest called Florentius who, moved by envy, tried to ruin him</span>
				<span class='text'>He tried to poison him with poisoned bread</span>
				<span class='text'>When he prayed a blessing over the bread, a raven swept in and took the loaf away</span>
				<span class='text'>From this time his miracles seem to have become frequent, and many people, attracted by his sanctity and character, came to Subiaco to be under his guidance</span>
				<span class='text'>Having failed by sending him poisonous bread, Florentius tried to seduce his monks with some prostitutes</span>
				<span class='text'>To avoid further temptations, in 530 Benedict left Subiaco</span>
				<span class='text'>He founded 12 monasteries in the vicinity of Subiaco, and, eventually, in 530 he founded the great Benedictine monastery of Monte Cassino,&lt;ref name=SHMI /&gt; which lies on a hilltop between Rome and Naples</span>
