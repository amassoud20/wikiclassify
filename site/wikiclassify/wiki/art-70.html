				<span class='text'>But it also has a unique spirit of balance moderation and reasonableness ἐπιείκεια epieikeia and this persuaded most religious communities founded throughout the Middle Ages to adopt it</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result his Rule became one of the most influential religious rules in Western </span>
				<span class='text'>For this reason Benedict is often called the founder of western monasticism</span>
				<span class='text'>iographyApart from a short poem attributed to Mark of Monte Cassino the only ancient account of Benedict is found in the second volume of s four book  thought to have been written in 593</span>

				<span class='text'>Gregory’s account of this saint’s life is not however a biography in the modern sense of the word</span>
				<span class='text'>It provides instead a  of the gentle disciplined abbot</span>
				<span class='text'>In a letter to Bishop Maximilian of Syracuse Gregory states his intention for his Dialogues saying they are a kind of floretum an anthology literally flowers of the most striking miracles of Italian holy men</span>

				<span class='text'>Gregory did not set out to write a chronological historically anchored story of St</span>
				<span class='text'>Benedict but he did base his anecdotes on direct testimony</span>
				<span class='text'>To establish his authority Gregory explains that his information came from what he considered the best sources a handful of Benedict’s disciples who lived with the saint and witnessed his various miracles</span>
				<span class='text'>These followers he says are Constantinus who succeeded Benedict as  of Monte Cassino Valentinianus Simplicius and Honoratus who was abbot of Subiaco when St Gregory wrote his Dialogues</span>
				<span class='text'>n Gregorys day history was not recognised as an independent field of study it was a branch of grammar or rhetoric and historia defined as story summed up the approach of the learned when they wrote what was at that time considered history</span>

				<span class='text'>St Gregorys narrative makes it impossible to suppose him younger than 19 or 20 at the time</span>

				<span class='text'> Enfide which the tradition of Subiaco identifies with the modern  is in the  mountains about forty miles from Rome and two from Subiaco</span>
				<span class='text'> short distance from Enfide is the entrance to a narrow gloomy valley penetrating the mountains and leading directly to Subiaco</span>
				<span class='text'>The path continues to ascend and the side of the ravine on which it runs becomes steeper until a cave is reached above which the mountain now rises almost perpendicularly while on the right it strikes in a rapid descent down to where in St Benedicts day  below lay the blue waters of the lake</span>
				<span class='text'>The cave has a large triangular shaped opening and is about ten feet deep</span>
				<span class='text'>n his way from Enfide Benedict met a monk  whose monastery was on the mountain above the cliff overhanging the cave</span>
				<span class='text'>Romanus had discussed with Benedict the purpose which had brought him to Subiaco and had given him the monks habit</span>
				<span class='text'>By his advice Benedict became a hermit and for three years unknown to men lived in this cave above the lake</span>
				<span class='text'>One day the Devil brought before his imagination a beautiful woman he had formerly known inflaming his heart with strong desire for her</span>
				<span class='text'>Immediately Benedict stripped off his clothes and rolled into a thorn bush until his body was lacerated</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus through the wounds of the body he cured the wounds of his soul</span>
				<span class='text'>name SHMI  Later lifeSt Gregory tells us little of these years</span>
				<span class='text'>He now speaks of Benedict no longer as a youth puer but as a man vir of God</span>
				<span class='text'>Romanus he twice tells us served the saint in every way he could</span>
				<span class='text'>The monk apparently visited him frequently and on fixed days brought him food</span>
				<span class='text'>name Crawley    Image with questionable fair use claim removed    During these three years of solitude broken only by occasional communications with the outer world and by the visits of Romanus Benedict matured both in mind and character in knowledge of himself and of his fellow man and at the same time he became not merely known to but secured the respect of those about him so much so that on the death of the abbot of a monastery in the neighbourhood identified by some with  the community came to him and begged him to become its abbot</span>
				<span class='text'>Benedict was acquainted with the life and discipline of the monastery and knew that their manners were diverse from his and theore that they would never agree together yet at length overcome with their entreaty he gave his consent ibid</span>
				<span class='text'>3</span>
				<span class='text'>The experiment failed the monks tried to poison him</span>
				<span class='text'>The legend goes that they first tried to poison his drink</span>
				<span class='text'>He prayed a blessing over the cup and the cup shattered</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus he left the group and went back to his cave at Subiaco</span>
				<span class='text'>There lived in the neighborhood a priest called Florentius who moved by envy tried to ruin him</span>
				<span class='text'>He tried to poison him with poisoned bread</span>
				<span class='text'>When he prayed a blessing over the bread a raven swept in and took the loaf away</span>
				<span class='text'>From this time his miracles seem to have become frequent and many people attracted by his sanctity and character came to Subiaco to be under his guidance</span>
				<span class='text'>Having failed by sending him poisonous bread Florentius tried to seduce his monks with some prostitutes</span>
				<span class='text'>To avoid further temptations in 530 Benedict left Subiaco</span>
				<span class='text'>He founded 12 monasteries in the vicinity of Subiaco and eventually in 530 he founded the great Benedictine monastery of Monte Cassino name SHMI   which lies on a hilltop between Rome and Naples</span>
