				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|alt=Studio photo of a smiling Oscar Hammerstein|Hammerstein about 1940]]When Sondheim was about ten years old (around the time of his parents' divorce), he became friends with [[James Hammerstein]], son of lyricist and playwright [[Oscar Hammerstein II]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The elder Hammerstein became Sondheim's surrogate father, influencing him profoundly and developing his love of musical theatre</span>
				<span class='text'>Sondheim met [[Harold Prince|Hal Prince]], who would direct many of his shows, at the opening of ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]],'' Hammerstein's musical with [[Richard Rodgers]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The comic musical he wrote at George School, ''By George'', was a success among his peers and buoyed the young songwriter's self-esteem</span>
				<span class='text'>When Sondheim asked Hammerstein to evaluate it as though he had no knowledge of its author, he said it was the worst thing he had ever seen: &quot;But if you want to know why it's terrible, I'll tell you</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; They spent the rest of the day going over the musical, and Sondheim later said, &quot;In that afternoon I learned more about songwriting and the musical theater than most people learn in a lifetime</span>

				<span class='text'>His first teacher there was Robert Barrow:&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>everybody hated him because he was very dry, and I thought he was wonderful because he was very dry</span>
				<span class='text'>And Barrow made me realize that all my romantic views of art were nonsense</span>
				<span class='text'>I had always thought an angel came down and sat on your shoulder and whispered in your ear 'dah-dah-dah-DUM</span>
				<span class='text'> Never occurred to me that art was something worked out</span>
				<span class='text'>And suddenly it was skies opening up</span>
				<span class='text'>As soon as you find out what a [[Leading-tone|leading tone]] is, you think, Oh my God</span>
				<span class='text'>What a [[diatonic scale]] is – Oh my God! The logic of it</span>

				<span class='text'>Because you just don't know</span>

				<span class='text'>He never saw his mentor again; three days later, Hammerstein died of stomach cancer and Hammerstein's protégé eulogized him at his funeral</span>
				<span class='text'>={{anchor|As both composer and lyricist}}As composer and lyricist==The first musical for which Sondheim wrote the music and lyrics was ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'', which opened in 1962 and ran for 964 performances</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Musical theatre#Book musicals|book]], based on [[farce]]s by [[Plautus]], was written by Burt Shevelove and Larry Gelbart</span>
				<span class='text'>Sondheim's score was not well received; although the show won several [[Tony Award]]s (including best musical), he did not receive a nomination</span>
				<span class='text'>== Broadway failures and other projects ===Sondheim had participated in three straight hits, but his next show – 1964's ''[[Anyone Can Whistle]]'' – was a nine-performance failure (although it introduced [[Angela Lansbury]] to musical theatre)</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;rich&quot;/&gt; He asked author and playwright [[James Goldman]] to join him as [[bookwriter]] for a new musical</span>
				<span class='text'>Inspired by a ''New York Times'' article about a gathering of former [[Ziegfeld Follies]] showgirls, it was entitled ''The Girl Upstairs'' (and would later become ''[[Follies]]'')</span>

				<span class='text'>''Follies'' focuses on two couples: Buddy and Sally Durant Plummer, and Benjamin and Phyllis Rogers Stone</span>
				<span class='text'>'[[A Little Night Music]]'' (1973), with a more traditional plot based on [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s ''[[Smiles of a Summer Night]]'' and a score primarily in [[Time signature|waltz time]], was one of the composer's greatest successes</span>

				<span class='text'>om&quot;/&gt; In 1979, 14-year-old [[Adam Guettel]] (son of [[Mary Rodgers]] and grandson of [[Richard Rodgers]]) showed Sondheim his work (as Sondheim had shown Hammerstein)</span>
				<span class='text'>Guettel was &quot;crestfallen&quot;, and the composer wrote to apologize for being &quot;not very encouraging&quot; when he was trying to be &quot;constructive&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>In Larson's musical ''[[Tick, Tick</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Boom!]]'', the phone message is played in which Sondheim apologizes for leaving early, says he wants to meet him and is impressed with his work</span>
				<span class='text'>After Larson's death, Sondheim called him one of the few composers &quot;attempting to blend contemporary pop music with theater music, which doesn't work very well; he was on his way to finding a real synthesis</span>
				<span class='text'>A good deal of pop music has interesting lyrics, but they are not theater lyrics&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>A musical-theatre composer &quot;must have a sense of what is theatrical, of how you use music to tell a story, as opposed to writing a song</span>
