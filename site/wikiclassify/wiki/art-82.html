				<span class='text'> and it has been suggested that the most comparable English name in meaning only would be Victoria</span>
				<span class='text'>Tacitus and Cassius Dio agree that Boudica was of  descent</span>
				<span class='text'>Dio describes her as possessed of greater intelligence than often belongs to women</span>
				<span class='text'>He also describes her as tall with  hair hanging down to below her waist a harsh voice and a piercing glare</span>
				<span class='text'>He notes that she habitually wore a large golden necklace perhaps a  a colourful tunic and a thick cloak fastened by a </span>
				<span class='text'>The term  translated in this passage as red‚Äìbrown or tawny can also mean auburn or a shade short of brown but most translators now agree a colour in between light and browny red ‚Äî tawny ‚Äî  Boudicca‚Äôs husband  was the king of the Iceni a people who inhabited roughly what is now Norfolk</span>
				<span class='text'>The Iceni initially voluntarily allied with Rome following Claudiuss conquest of Southern Britain AD 43</span>
				<span class='text'>They were proud of their independence and had revolted in AD 47 when the then Roman governor  planned to disarm all the peoples in the area of Britain under Roman control following a number of local uprisings</span>
				<span class='text'>Ostorius defeated them and went on to put down other uprisings around Britain</span>
				<span class='text'>acitus The Annals 12</span>
				<span class='text'>1 32  The Iceni remained independent</span>
				<span class='text'>Tacitus first mentioned Prasutagus when he wrote about Boudica‚Äôs rebellion</span>
				<span class='text'>We do not know whether he became the king after the mentioned defeat of the Iceni</span>
				<span class='text'>We do not have any record as to whether the Iceni at that point were still Roman allies or had become a client kingdom</span>
				<span class='text'>acitus wrote ‚ÄúThe Icenian king Prasutagus celebrated for his long prosperity had named the emperor his heir together with his two daughters an act of deference which he thought would place his kingdom and household beyond the risk of injury</span>
				<span class='text'>The result was contrary ‚Äî so much so that his kingdom was pillaged by centurions his household by slaves as though they had been prizes of war</span>
				<span class='text'>Äù He added that Boudica was lashed and her two daughters were raped and that the estates of the leading Iceni men were confiscated</span>
				<span class='text'>acitus The Annals14</span>
				<span class='text'>1 Cassius Dio wrote  ‚ÄúAn excuse for the war was found in the confiscation of the sums of money that Claudius had given to the foremost Britons for these sums as  the procurator of the island maintained were to be paid back</span>
				<span class='text'>Äù  He also said that another reasons was ‚Äúthe fact that Seneca in the hope of receiving a good rate of interest had lent to the islanders 40000000 sesterces that they did not want and had afterwards called in this loan all at once and had resorted to severe measures in exacting it</span>
				<span class='text'>Cassius Dio Roman History 62</span>
				<span class='text'> Tacitus did not say why Prasutagus‚Äô naming the emperor as his heir as well as his daughters was meant to avert the risk of injury</span>
				<span class='text'>He did not explain why the Romans pillaged the kingdom why they took the lands of the chiefs or why Boudica was flogged and her daughters were raped</span>
				<span class='text'>Cassius Dio did not mention any of this</span>
				<span class='text'>He said that the cause of the rebellion was the decision of the procurator of Britain the chief financial officer and Seneca an advisor of the emperor Nero to call in Prasutagus‚Äô debts and the harsh measures which were taken to collect them</span>
				<span class='text'>Tacitus does not mention these events</span>
				<span class='text'>However he wrote ‚ÄúAlarmed by this disaster and by the fury of the province which he had goaded into war by his rapacity the procurator Catus crossed over into Gaul</span>
				<span class='text'>Äù Tacitus The Annals14</span>
				<span class='text'>2 It has to be noted that this was happening while the governor of Britain Gaius Suetonius Paulinus was away fighting in North Wales</span>
				<span class='text'>We do not know whether he approved of these actions</span>
				<span class='text'>We do not know who the centurions who pillaged the kingdom were and who sent them</span>
				<span class='text'>The text of Cassius Dio seems to suggest that Seneca who was a private citizen was responsible for the violence</span>
				<span class='text'>It is unlikely that a legion was sent to land of the Iceni as two of them were fighting at the island of Anglesey and the other two were stationed at their garrisons</span>
				<span class='text'>Tacitus said that ‚ÄúIt was against the veterans that their hatred was most intense</span>
				<span class='text'>For these new settlers in the colony of Camulodunum drove people out of their houses ejected them from their farms called them captives and slaves ‚Ä¶‚Äù Tacitus The Annals 14</span>
				<span class='text'>1  This could raise the possibility that it was the retired veterans who were no longer subject to military discipline who might have been called on to or hired to intervene in the kingdom of the Iceni and may help to account for the extent of the violence and abuse</span>
				<span class='text'>n AD 60 or 61 while the current governor  was leading a campaign against the island of  modern  in the north of Wales which was a uge for British rebels and a stronghold of the s the Iceni conspired with their neighbours the Trinovantes amongst others to revolt</span>
				<span class='text'>Boudica was chosen as their leader</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Tacitus they drew inspiration from the example of  the prince of the  who had driven the Romans out of Germany in AD 9 and their own ancestors who had driven  from Britain</span>
				<span class='text'>acitus    Dio says that at the outset Boudica employed a form of  releasing a  from the folds of her dress and interpreting the direction in which it ran and invoked  a British  of </span>
				<span class='text'>he rebels first target was   the former Trinovantian capital and at that time a Roman </span>
				<span class='text'>The Roman veterans who had been settled there mistreated the locals and a temple to the former emperor  had been erected there at local expense making the city a focus for resentment</span>
				<span class='text'>The Roman inhabitants sought reinforcements from the procurator Catus Decianus but he sent only two hundred </span>

				<span class='text'>His infantry was wiped out‚Äîonly the commander and some of his cavalry escaped</span>
				<span class='text'>The location of this famous destruction of the  is now claimed by some to be the village of  in Suffolk which lies in the Stour Valley on the Icknield Way West of Colchester and by a village in Essex</span>

				<span class='text'>Suetonius considered giving battle there but considering his lack of numbers and chastened by Petilliuss defeat decided to sacrifice the city to save the province</span>
				<span class='text'>lockquoteAlarmed by this disaster and by the fury of the province which he had goaded into war by his rapacity the procurator Catus crossed over into Gaul</span>
				<span class='text'>Suetonius however with wonderful resolution marched amidst a hostile population to Londinium which though undistinguished by the name of a colony was much frequented by a number of merchants and trading vessels</span>
				<span class='text'>Uncertain whether he should choose it as a seat of war as he looked round on his scanty force of soldiers and remembered with what a serious warning the rashness of Petilius had been punished he resolved to save the province at the cost of a single town</span>
				<span class='text'>Nor did the tears and weeping of the people as they implored his aid deter him from giving the signal of departure and receiving into his army all who would go with him</span>

				<span class='text'>She a woman was resolved to win or die if the men wanted to live in slavery that was their choice</span>
				<span class='text'>owever the lack of manoeuvrability of the British forces combined with lack of open field tactics to command these numbers put them at a disadvantage to the Romans who were skilled at open combat due to their superior equipment and discipline</span>
				<span class='text'>Also the narrowness of the field meant that Boudica could put forth only as many troops as the Romans could at a given time</span>
				<span class='text'>irst the Romans stood their ground and used volleys of  heavy javelins to kill thousands of Britons who were rushing toward the Roman lines</span>
				<span class='text'>The Roman soldiers who had now used up their  were then able to engage Boudicas second wave in the open</span>
				<span class='text'>As the Romans advanced in a  formation the Britons attempted to flee but were impeded by the presence of their own families whom they had stationed in a ring of wagons at the edge of the battlefield and were slaughtered</span>
				<span class='text'>This is not the first instance of this tactic ‚Äî the women of the  in the  against  were stationed in a line of wagons and acted as a last line of defence</span>

				<span class='text'>ccording to Tacitus in his Annals Boudica poisoned herself though in the  which was written almost twenty years prior he mentions nothing of suicide and attributes the end of the revolt to  indolence Dio says she fell sick and died and then was given a lavish burial though this may be a convenient way to remove her from the story</span>
				<span class='text'>Considering Dio must have read Tacitus it is worth noting he mentions nothing about suicide which was also how Postumus and Nero ended their lives</span>
