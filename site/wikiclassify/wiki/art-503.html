				<span class='text'>Hobbes was exposed to European scientific and critical methods during the tour in contrast to the [[scholastic philosophy]] which he had learned in Oxford</span>
				<span class='text'>His scholarly efforts at the time were aimed at a careful study of classic Greek and Latin authors, the outcome of which was, in 1628, his great translation of [[Thucydides]]' ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', the first translation of that work into English from a Greek manuscript</span>
				<span class='text'>It has been argued that three of the discourses in the 1620 publication known as ''Horea Subsecivae: Observations and Discourses'', also represent the work of Hobbes from this period</span>

				<span class='text'>His employer Cavendish, then the Earl of Devonshire, died of the [[Bubonic plague|plague]] in June 1628</span>
				<span class='text'>The widowed countess dismissed Hobbes but he soon found work, again as a tutor, this time to [[Sir Gervase Clifton, 2nd Baronet|Gervase Clifton]], the son of [[Sir Gervase Clifton, 1st Baronet]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This task, chiefly spent in Paris, ended in 1631 when he again found work with the Cavendish family, tutoring [[William Cavendish, 3rd Earl of Devonshire|William]], the eldest son of his previous pupil</span>
				<span class='text'>Over the next seven years as well as tutoring he expanded his own knowledge of philosophy, awakening in him curiosity over key philosophic debates</span>
				<span class='text'>He visited [[Florence]] in 1636 and was later a regular debater in philosophic groups in Paris, held together by [[Marin Mersenne]]</span>
				<span class='text'>From 1637 he considered himself a philosopher and scholar</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed |date= February 2014}}==In Paris==[[File:Thomas Hobbes</span>
				<span class='text'>peg|thumb|right|200px|Thomas Hobbes]]Hobbes's first area of study was an interest in the physical doctrine of motion and physical momentum</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite his interest in this phenomenon, he disdained experimental work as in [[physics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He went on to conceive the system of thought to the elaboration of which he would devote his life</span>
				<span class='text'>His scheme was first to work out, in a separate treatise, a systematic doctrine of body, showing how physical phenomena were universally explicable in terms of motion, at least as motion or mechanical action was then understood</span>
				<span class='text'>He then singled out Man from the realm of Nature and plants</span>
				<span class='text'>Then, in another treatise, he showed what specific bodily motions were involved in the production of the peculiar phenomena of sensation, knowledge, affections and passions whereby Man came into relation with Man</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally he considered, in his crowning treatise, how Men were moved to enter into society, and argued how this must be regulated if Men were not to fall back into &quot;brutishness and misery&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus he proposed to unite the separate phenomena of Body, Man, and the State</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=February 2014}}Hobbes came home, in 1637, to a country riven with discontent which disrupted him from the orderly execution of his philosophic plan</span>
				<span class='text'>However, by the end of the [[Short Parliament]] in 1640, he had written a short treatise called ''The Elements of Law, Natural and Politic''</span>
				<span class='text'>It was not published and only circulated among his acquaintances in manuscript form</span>
				<span class='text'>A pirated version, however, was published about ten years later</span>
				<span class='text'>Although it seems that much of ''The Elements of Law'' was composed before the sitting of the Short Parliament, there are polemical pieces of the work that clearly mark the influences of the rising political crisis</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, many (though not all) elements of Hobbes's political thought were unchanged between ''The Elements of Law'' and ''Leviathan,'' which demonstrates that the events of the [[English Civil War]] had little effect on his [[contractarian]] methodology</span>
				<span class='text'>It should be noted, however, that the arguments in ''Leviathan'' were modified from ''The Elements of Law'' when it came to the necessity of consent in creating political obligation</span>
				<span class='text'>Namely, Hobbes wrote in ''The Elements of Law'' that Patrimonial kingdoms were not necessarily formed by the consent of the governed, while in ''Leviathan'' he argued that they were</span>
				<span class='text'>This was perhaps a reflection either of Hobbes's thoughts concerning the [[engagement controversy]] or of his reaction to treatises published by [[Patriarchalism|Patriarchalists]], such as [[Sir Robert Filmer]], between 1640 and 1651</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=February 2014}}When in November 1640 the [[Long Parliament]] succeeded the Short, Hobbes felt he was a marked man by the circulation of his treatise and fled to Paris</span>
				<span class='text'>He did not return for eleven years</span>
				<span class='text'>In Paris he rejoined the coterie about Mersenne, and wrote a critique of the ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' of [[Descartes]], which was printed as third among the sets of &quot;Objections&quot; appended, with &quot;Replies&quot; from Descartes in 1641</span>
				<span class='text'>A different set of remarks on other works by Descartes succeeded only in ending all correspondence between the two</span>
				<span class='text'>obbes also extended his own works somewhat, working on the third section, ''[[De Cive]]'', which was finished in November 1641</span>
				<span class='text'>Although it was initially only circulated privately, it was well received, and included lines of argumentation to be repeated a decade later in the ''Leviathan''</span>
				<span class='text'>He then returned to hard work on the first two sections of his work and published little except for a short treatise on optics (''Tractatus opticus'') included in the collection of scientific tracts published by Mersenne as ''Cogitata physico-mathematica'' in 1644</span>
				<span class='text'>He built a good reputation in philosophic circles and in 1645 was chosen with Descartes, [[Gilles de Roberval]] and others, to referee the controversy between [[John Pell]] and [[Longomontanus]] over the problem of [[squaring the circle]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Civil war in England==The [[English Civil War]] broke out in 1642, and when the [[Cavalier|Royalist]] cause began to decline in the middle of 1644 there followed an exodus of the king's supporters to Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>Many came to Paris and were known to Hobbes</span>
				<span class='text'>This revitalised Hobbes's political interests and the ''De Cive'' was republished and more widely distributed</span>
				<span class='text'>The printing began in 1646 by [[Samuel de Sorbiere]] through the [[House of Elzevir|Elsevier press]] at [[Amsterdam]] with a new preface and some new notes in reply to objections</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1647 Hobbes took up a position as mathematical instructor to the young [[Charles II of England|Charles, Prince of Wales]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>om/people/691/000031598// |title = People |publisher=NNDB |accessdate=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had come over from [[Jersey]] around July</span>
				<span class='text'> This engagement lasted until 1648 when Charles went to Holland</span>
				<span class='text'>he company of the exiled royalists led Hobbes to produce an English book to set forth his theory of civil government in relation to the political crisis resulting from the war</span>
				<span class='text'>The State, it now seemed to Hobbes, might be regarded as a great artificial man or monster ([[leviathan]]), composed of men, with a life that might be traced from its generation under pressure of human needs to its dissolution through civil strife proceeding from human passions</span>
				<span class='text'>The work closed with a general &quot;Review and Conclusion&quot;, in direct response to the war, which raised the question of the subject's right to change allegiance when a former sovereign's power to protect was irrevocably lost</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Hobbes de cive</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Frontispiece from ''De Cive'' (1642)]]During the years of the composition of ''Leviathan'', Hobbes remained in or near Paris</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1647 a serious illness disabled him for six months</span>
				<span class='text'>On recovering from this near fatal disorder, he resumed his literary task, and carried it steadily forward to completion by 1650</span>
				<span class='text'>Meanwhile, a translation of ''De Cive'' was being produced; scholars disagree over whether Hobbes translated the work himself or not</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1650 a pirated edition of ''The Elements of Law, Natural and Politic'' was published</span>
				<span class='text'>It was divided into two separate small volumes (''Human Nature, or the Fundamental Elements of Policie'' and ''De corpore politico, or the Elements of Law, Moral and Politick'')</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1651 the translation of ''[[De Cive]]'' was published under the title of ''Philosophicall Rudiments concerning Government and Society''</span>
				<span class='text'>Meanwhile, the printing of the greater work proceeded, and finally it appeared about the middle of 1651, under the title of ''Leviathan, or the Matter, Forme, and Power of a Common Wealth, Ecclesiasticall and Civil'', with a famous title-page engraving in which, from behind hills overlooking a landscape, there towered the body (above the waist) of a crowned giant, made up of tiny figures of human beings and bearing sword and [[crozier]] in the two hands</span>
				<span class='text'>he work had immediate impact</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon Hobbes found himself more lauded and decried than any other thinker of his time</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the first effect of its publication was to sever his link with the exiled royalists, forcing him to appeal to the revolutionary English government for protection</span>
				<span class='text'>The exiles might very well have killed him; the secularist spirit of his book greatly angered both Anglicans and French Catholics</span>
				<span class='text'>Hobbes fled back to England, arriving in London in the winter of 1651</span>
				<span class='text'>Following his submission to the [[English Council of State|Council of State]] he was allowed to subside into private life in [[Fetter Lane]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=''Leviathan''=={{Main|Leviathan (book)}}[[File:Leviathan by Thomas Hobbes</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|Frontispiece of ''Leviathan'']]In ''Leviathan'', Hobbes set out his doctrine of the foundation of [[State (polity)|states]] and legitimate governments and creating an objective science of morality</span>
				<span class='text'>This gave rise to [[social contract theory]]</span>
				<span class='text'>''Leviathan'' was written during the [[English Civil War]]; much of the book is occupied with demonstrating the necessity of a strong central authority to avoid the evil of discord and civil war</span>
				<span class='text'>eginning from a [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] understanding of human beings and the passions, Hobbes postulates what life would be like without government, a condition which he calls the [[state of nature]]; much of this was based on [[Hugo Grotius]]' works</span>
				<span class='text'>In that state, each person would have a right, or license, to everything in the world</span>
				<span class='text'>This, Hobbes argues, would lead to a &quot;war of all against all&quot; (''[[bellum omnium contra omnes]]'')</span>
				<span class='text'>The description contains what has been called one of the best known passages in English philosophy, which describes the natural state mankind would be in, were it not for political community:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gaskin|chapter=Introduction|title=Human Nature and De Corpore Politico|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=xxx|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quotation|In such condition, there is no place for industry; because the fruit thereof is uncertain: and consequently no culture of the earth; no navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by sea; no commodious building; no instruments of moving, and removing, such things as require much force; no knowledge of the face of the earth; no account of time; no arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear, and danger of violent death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short</span>

				<span class='text'>So in order to avoid it people accede to a [[social contract theory|social contract]] and establish a [[civil society]]</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Hobbes, society is a population beneath a [[sovereign]] [[authority]], to whom all individuals in that society cede some rights for the sake of protection</span>
				<span class='text'>Any power exercised by this authority can not be resisted because the protector's sovereign power derives from individuals' surrendering their own sovereign power for protection</span>
				<span class='text'>The individuals are thereby the authors of all decisions made by the sovereign</span>

				<span class='text'>=Opposition=====John Bramhall===Hobbes now turned to complete the fundamental treatise of his philosophical system</span>
				<span class='text'>He worked so steadily that ''[[De Corpore]]'' was first printed in 1654</span>
				<span class='text'>Also in 1654, a small treatise, ''Of Liberty and Necessity'', was published by Bishop [[John Bramhall]], addressed at Hobbes</span>
				<span class='text'>Bramhall, a strong [[Arminianism|Arminian]], had met and debated with Hobbes and afterwards wrote down his views and sent them privately to be answered in this form by Hobbes</span>
				<span class='text'>Hobbes duly replied, but not for publication</span>
				<span class='text'>But a French acquaintance took a copy of the reply and published it with &quot;an extravagantly laudatory epistle</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Bramhall countered in 1655, when he printed everything that had passed between them (under the title of ''A Defence of the True Liberty of Human Actions from Antecedent or Extrinsic Necessity'')</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1656 Hobbes was ready with ''The Questions concerning Liberty, Necessity and Chance'', in which he replied &quot;with astonishing force&quot; to the bishop</span>
				<span class='text'>As perhaps the first clear exposition of the psychological doctrine of determinism, Hobbes's own two pieces were important in the history of the [[Free will|free-will]] controversy</span>
				<span class='text'>The bishop returned to the charge in 1658 with ''Castigations of Mr Hobbes's Animadversions'', and also included a bulky appendix entitled ''The Catching of Leviathan the Great Whale''</span>
				<span class='text'>==John Wallis==={{details|Hobbes–Wallis controversy}}Hobbes opposed the existing academic arrangements, and assailed the system of the original universities in ''Leviathan''</span>
				<span class='text'>He went on to publish &quot;[[De Corpore]]&quot;, which contained not only tendentious views on mathematics, but also an unacceptable proof of the [[squaring of the circle]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This all led mathematicians to target him for [[polemics]] and sparked [[John Wallis]] to become one of his most persistent opponents</span>
				<span class='text'>From 1655, the publishing date of &quot;De Corpore&quot;, Hobbes and Wallis went round after round trying to disprove each other's positions</span>
				<span class='text'>After years of debate, the spat over proving the squaring of the circle gained such notoriety that this feud has become one of the most infamous in mathematical history</span>
				<span class='text'>==Atheism===Hobbes has been accused of [[atheism]], or (in the case of Bramhall) of teachings which could lead to atheism</span>
				<span class='text'>This was an important accusation, and Hobbes himself wrote, in his answer to Bramhall's &quot;the catching of the Leviathan&quot; that &quot;atheism, impiety, and the like are words of the greatest defamation possible&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;p</span>
				<span class='text'>282 of Molesworth's edition</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Hobbes always defended himself from such accusations</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Martinich|1995|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;In more recent times also, much has been made of his religious views by scholars such as Richard Tuck and [[J</span>
				<span class='text'>G</span>
				<span class='text'>A</span>
				<span class='text'>Pocock]], but there is still widespread disagreement about the exact significance of Hobbes's unusual views on religion</span>
				<span class='text'>s {{Harvtxt|Martinich|1995|p=31}} has pointed out, in Hobbes's time, the term &quot;atheist&quot; was frequently applied to people who believed in God, but not [[divine providence]], or to people who believed in God, but also maintained other beliefs which were inconsistent with such belief</span>
				<span class='text'>He says that this &quot;sort of discrepancy has led to many errors in determining who was an atheist in the [[early modern period]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>In this extended early modern sense of atheism, Hobbes did indeed take positions which were in strong disagreement with church teachings of his time</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, Hobbes argued repeatedly that there are no incorporeal substances, and that all things, including human thoughts, and even God, heaven, and hell are corporeal, matter in motion</span>
				<span class='text'>He argued that &quot;though Scripture acknowledge spirits, yet doth it nowhere say, that they are incorporeal, meaning thereby without dimensions and quantity&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Human Nature'' I</span>
				<span class='text'>I</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; (In this view, Hobbes claimed to be following [[Tertullian]], whose views were not condemned in the [[First Council of Nicaea]]</span>
				<span class='text'> He also, like [[John Locke|Locke]], stated that true [[revelation]] can never be in disagreement with human reason and experience,&lt;ref&gt;''Leviathan'' III</span>
				<span class='text'>xxii</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>e are not to renounce our Senses, and Experience; nor (that which is undoubted Word of God) our naturall Reason&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; although he also argues that people should accept revelation and its interpretations also for the reason that they should accept the commands of their sovereign, in order to avoid war</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Tomb of Thomas Hobbes in [[St John the Baptist's Church, Ault Hucknall]]]]In 1658, Hobbes published the final section of his philosophical system, completing the scheme he had planned more than twenty years before</span>
				<span class='text'>''De Homine'' consisted for the most part of an elaborate theory of vision</span>
				<span class='text'>The remainder of the treatise dealt cursorily with some of the topics more fully treated in the ''Human Nature'' and the ''Leviathan''</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition to publishing some controversial writings on mathematics and physics, Hobbes also continued to produce philosophical works</span>
				<span class='text'>From the time of the [[The Restoration|Restoration]] he acquired a new prominence; &quot;Hobbism&quot; became a byword for all that respectable society ought to denounce</span>
				<span class='text'>The young king, Hobbes' former pupil, now Charles II, remembered Hobbes and called him to the court to grant him a pension of £100</span>
				<span class='text'>he king was important in protecting Hobbes when, in 1666, the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] introduced a bill against atheism and profaneness</span>
				<span class='text'>That same year, on 17 October 1666, it was ordered that the committee to which the bill was referred &quot;should be empowered to receive information touching such books as tend to atheism, blasphemy and profaneness</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>in particular</span>

				<span class='text'>sp?compid=26780|accessdate=14 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbes was terrified at the prospect of being labelled a heretic, and proceeded to burn some of his compromising papers</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time, he examined the actual state of the law of [[Christian heresy|heresy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The results of his investigation were first announced in three short Dialogues added as an ''Appendix'' to his ''Latin translation of Leviathan'', published in Amsterdam in 1668</span>
				<span class='text'>In this appendix, Hobbes aimed to show that, since the [[Court of High Commission|High Court of Commission]] had been put down, there remained no court of heresy at all to which he was amenable, and that nothing could be heresy except opposing the [[Nicene Creed]], which, he maintained, ''Leviathan'' did not do</span>
				<span class='text'>he only consequence that came of the bill was that Hobbes could never thereafter publish anything in England on subjects relating to human conduct</span>
				<span class='text'>The 1668 edition of his works was printed in Amsterdam because he could not obtain the censor's licence for its publication in England</span>
				<span class='text'>Other writings were not made public until after his death, including ''Behemoth: the History of the Causes of the Civil Wars of England and of the Counsels and Artifices by which they were carried on from the year 1640 to the year 1662''</span>
				<span class='text'>For some time, Hobbes was not even allowed to respond, whatever his enemies tried</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite this, his reputation abroad was formidable, and noble or learned foreigners who came to England never forgot to pay their respects to the old philosopher</span>
				<span class='text'>is final works were a curious mixture: an autobiography in Latin verse in 1672, and a translation of four books of the ''[[Odyssey]]'' into &quot;rugged&quot; English rhymes that in 1673 led to a complete translation of both ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''Odyssey'' in 1675</span>
				<span class='text'>n October 1679, Hobbes suffered a bladder disorder, which was followed by a paralytic stroke from which he died on 4 December 1679</span>
				<span class='text'>He is said to have uttered the last words &quot;A great leap in the dark&quot; in his final moments of life</span>
