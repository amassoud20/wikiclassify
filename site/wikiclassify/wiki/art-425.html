				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; was a military and political leader of the late [[Roman Republic]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He came from a wealthy [[Picenum|Italian provincial]] background, and his father had been the first to establish the family among the [[nobiles|Roman nobility]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Pompey's immense success as a general while still very young enabled him to advance directly to his first [[Roman consul|consulship]] without meeting the normal [[cursus honorum|requirements for office]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His success as a military commander in [[Sulla's Second Civil War]] resulted in Sulla bestowing the [[cognomen|nickname]] ''[[List of Roman cognomina#M|Magnus]]'', &quot;the Great&quot;, upon him</span>
				<span class='text'>He was consul three times and celebrated three [[Roman triumph|triumphs]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n mid-60 BC, Pompey joined [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]] and [[Julius Caesar|Gaius Julius Caesar]] in the unofficial military-political alliance known as the [[First Triumvirate]], which Pompey's marriage to Caesar's daughter [[Julia (daughter of Julius Caesar)|Julia]] helped secure</span>
				<span class='text'>After the deaths of Julia and Crassus, Pompey sided with the ''[[optimates]]'', the conservative faction of the [[Roman Senate]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Pompey and Caesar then contended for the leadership of the Roman state, leading to [[Caesar's Civil War|a civil war]]</span>
				<span class='text'>When Pompey was defeated at the [[Battle of Pharsalus]], he sought refuge in Egypt, where he was assassinated</span>
				<span class='text'>His career and defeat are significant in Rome's subsequent transformation from [[Roman Republic|Republic]] to [[Principate]] and [[Roman Empire|Empire]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Early life and political debut==Pompey's family first gained the position of Consul in 141 BC</span>
				<span class='text'>Pompey's father, [[Gnaeus Pompeius Strabo]], was a wealthy landed Italian provincial from [[Picenum]], one of the ''novi homines'' (new men)</span>
				<span class='text'>Pompeius Strabo ascended the traditional ''[[cursus honorum]]'', becoming ''[[quaestor]]'' in 104&amp;nbsp;BC, ''[[praetor]]'' in 92&amp;nbsp;BC and ''[[Roman Consul|consul]]'' in 89&amp;nbsp;BC, and acquired a reputation for greed, political double-dealing and military ruthlessness</span>
				<span class='text'>He supported [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Sulla]]'s traditionalist ''[[optimates]]'' against the [[Populares|popularist]] general [[Gaius Marius|Marius]] in the [[Sulla's first civil war|first Marian-Sullan]] war</span>

				<span class='text'>141&lt;/ref&gt; In 82&amp;nbsp;BC, Pompey secured Sicily, guaranteeing [[Rome's grain supply]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He executed Gnaeus Papirius Carbo and his supporters out of hand, which may have led to his dubbing as the ''adulescens carnifex'' (adolescent butcher)</span>

				<span class='text'>]&lt;/ref&gt; In 81&amp;nbsp;BC, he moved on to the Roman province of [[Africa Province|Africa]], where he defeated [[Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (died 81&amp;nbsp;BC)|Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus]] and the [[Numidia]]n king Hiarbas, after a hard-fought battle</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Life of Pompey, pgs</span>
				<span class='text'>143-5&lt;/ref&gt;After this string of victories, Pompey was proclaimed ''[[Imperator]]'' by his troops on the field in Africa; once back in Rome, he was given an enthusiastic popular reception and hailed by Sulla as ''Magnus'' (the Great)&amp;nbsp;‚Äì probably in recognition of Pompey's undoubted victories and popularity</span>
				<span class='text'>However, it seems that Sulla was reluctant to honor him</span>
				<span class='text'>The young general was still officially a mere ''[[privatus]]'' (private citizen) who had held no offices in the ''[[cursus honorum]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The title may have been meant to cut Pompey down to size; he himself used it only later in his career</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Life of Pompey, pg 148&amp;nbsp;‚Äì 149</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;When Pompey demanded a [[Roman triumph|triumph]] for his African victories, Sulla refused; it would have been an unprecedented, even illegal, honour for a young privatus&amp;nbsp;‚Äì by law, Pompey would have had to disband his legions</span>
				<span class='text'>Pompey refused, and presented himself expectantly at the gates of Rome, upon which Sulla gave in and granted his request</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Life of Pompey, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>149&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Sulla had his own triumph first, then allowed [[Metellus Pius]] his triumph, relegating Pompey to an extra-legal third place in a quick succession of triumphs</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pompey's age, his equestrian status and his victory over Roman foes should have disqualified him from a triumph</span>
				<span class='text'>Sulla's consent (formalised by his obedient senate as a Republican permission) made it a &quot;nontraditional&quot; and strictly illegal triumph, but a triumph nevertheless</span>
				<span class='text'>See Mary Beard, The Roman Triumph, The Belknapp Press, 2007</span>
				<span class='text'>16&amp;nbsp;‚Äì 17</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;On the day the triumph was to take place, Pompey attempted to upstage both his seniors in a triumphal chariot towed by an elephant, representing his exotic African conquests</span>
				<span class='text'>The elephant would not fit through the city gate</span>
				<span class='text'>Some hasty replanning was needed, much to the embarrassment of Pompey and amusement of those present</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Life of Pompey, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>151&lt;/ref&gt; His refusal to give in to his troops' near-mutinous demands for cash is believed by historians to have impressed his mentor and Rome's conservatives, ultimately leading to his rise in Rome's military and political hierarchy</span>

				<span class='text'>In&amp;nbsp;78 BC, Sulla died; when Lepidus revolted, Pompey suppressed him on behalf of the Senate</span>
				<span class='text'>He subsequently asked for [[proconsul]]ar ''[[imperium]]'' in [[Hispania]]&lt;ref&gt;The Iberian peninsula, roughly comprising modern Spain and Portugal</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; to deal with the ''[[populares]]''' general [[Quintus Sertorius]], who had held out for the past three years against [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius]], one of Sulla's most able generals</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Plutarch, Life of Pompey, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>158&quot;&gt;Plutarch, Life of Pompey, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>158&lt;/ref&gt;The Roman aristocracy turned him down, as they were beginning to fear the young, popular and successful general</span>
				<span class='text'>Pompey resorted to his tried and tested persuasion; he refused to disband his legions until his request was granted</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Plutarch, Life of Pompey, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>158&quot;/&gt; The senate acceded, reluctantly granted him the title of proconsul and powers equal to those of Metellus, and sent him to Hispania</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Boak, History of Rome, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>152&lt;/ref&gt;On his way to Spain, Pompey spent one year subduing rebellious tribes in southern Gaul and organizing the province</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Pro lege Manilia'', Cicero&lt;/ref&gt;Pompey remained in Hispania from 76&amp;nbsp;‚Äì 71&amp;nbsp;BC; he was, for a long time, unable to bring [[Sertorian War|the war]] to an end due to Sertorius' guerrilla tactics</span>
				<span class='text'>Though he was never able to decisively beat Sertorius (and he nearly met disaster at the battle of Sucro), he won several campaigns against Sertorius' junior officers and gradually took the advantage over his enemy in a war of attrition</span>
				<span class='text'>Sertorius was significantly weakened, and by 74&amp;nbsp;BC, Metellus and Pompey were winning city after city</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Boak, History of Rome, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>153&quot;&gt;Boak, History of Rome, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>153&lt;/ref&gt; In 72 BC, the Sertorians controlled little more than Lusitania and many soldiers were deserting</span>
				<span class='text'>inally, Pompey managed to crush the ''populares'' when Sertorius was murdered by his own officer, [[Marcus Perperna Vento]], who was decisively defeated in 72 BC by the young general, at their first battle</span>
				<span class='text'>By early 71 BC, the whole of Hispania was subdued</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Boak, History of Rome, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>153&quot;/&gt; Pompey showed a talent for efficient organisation and fair administration in the conquered province; this extended his patronage throughout Hispania and into southern [[Gaul]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Holland, Rubicon, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>142&lt;/ref&gt; Some time in 71 BC, he set off for Italy, along with his army</span>
				<span class='text'>eanwhile, [[Marcus Licinius Crassus|Crassus]] was facing [[Spartacus]] to end Rome's [[Third Servile War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Crassus defeated Spartacus, but in his march towards Rome, Pompey encountered the remnants of Spartacus' army; he captured five thousand of them and claimed the credit for finishing the revolt, which infuriated Crassus</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Holland, Rubicon, pgs</span>
				<span class='text'>150-51&lt;/ref&gt;Back in Rome, Pompey was wildly popular</span>
				<span class='text'>On December&amp;nbsp;31, 71&amp;nbsp;BC, he was given a triumph for his victories in Hispania&amp;nbsp;‚Äì like his first, it was granted extralegally</span>
				<span class='text'>To his admirers, he was the most brilliant general of the age, evidently favoured by the gods and a possible champion of the people's rights</span>
				<span class='text'>He had successfully faced down Sulla and his Senate; he or his influence might restore the traditional plebeian rights and privileges lost under Sulla's dictatorship</span>
				<span class='text'>ue to this, Pompey was allowed to bypass another ancient Roman tradition; at only 35 years of age and while not even a senator, he was elected [[Roman Consul|Consul]] by an overwhelming majority vote, and served in 70&amp;nbsp;BC with Crassus as partner</span>
				<span class='text'>Pompey's meteoric rise to the consulship was unprecedented; his tactics offended the traditionalist nobility whose values he claimed to share and defend</span>
				<span class='text'>He had left them no option but to allow his consulship</span>
				<span class='text'>=Campaign against the pirates=={{Further|Lex Gabinia}}[[File:Denier √† l'effigie de Pomp√©e</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Pompey]]Two years after his consulship, Pompey was offered command of a naval task force to deal with piracy in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The conservative faction of the Senate remained suspicious and wary of him; this seemed yet another illegal or at least extraordinary appointment</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Boak, History of Rome, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>160&quot;&gt;Boak, History of Rome, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>160&lt;/ref&gt; Pompey's supporters for this command&amp;nbsp;‚Äì including [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]&amp;nbsp;‚Äì were in the minority, but support was whipped up through his nomination by the [[Tribune]] of the Plebs [[Aulus Gabinius]] who proposed a ''[[Lex Gabinia]]''; Pompey should have control over the sea and the coasts for 50 miles inland</span>
				<span class='text'>This would set him above every military leader in the East&amp;nbsp;‚Äì it was passed despite vehement opposition</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to Rome's historians, [[piracy|pirates]] had freely plundered the coastal cities of Greece, Asia and Italy itself</span>
				<span class='text'>The extent and nature of their threat is questionable; anything that threatened Rome's grain supply was cause for panic, and the Romans tended to exaggerate any such threats</span>
				<span class='text'>Roman public opinion and Pompey's supporters may have exaggerated the solution</span>
				<span class='text'>Various settlements, peoples and city-states around the Mediterranean had coexisted several centuries and most had operated small fleets for war, or trade in commodities, including slaves</span>
				<span class='text'>Their alliances might be loose and temporary or more-or-less permanent; some regarded themselves as nations</span>

				<span class='text'>As long as they met Rome's increasing requirement for slaves, left her allies and territories untouched and offered her enemies no support, they were tolerated</span>
				<span class='text'>Some were subsidised</span>

				<span class='text'>k&quot;/&gt; But fear of piracy was potent&amp;nbsp;‚Äì and these same pirates, it was later alleged, had assisted Sertorius</span>
				<span class='text'>y the end of that winter, the preparations were complete</span>
				<span class='text'>Pompey allocated one of thirteen areas to each of his [[legatus|legates]], and sent out their fleets</span>
				<span class='text'>In forty days, the western Mediterranean was cleared</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Boak, History of Rome, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>160&quot;/&gt; Dio reported communication was restored between Hispania, Africa, and Italy;&lt;ref&gt;This probably refers to the grain supply; the extent of its interruption before Pompey's campaign is not known</span>
				<span class='text'>The reference to Hispania might relate to Sertorius' revolt and resistance&amp;nbsp;‚Äì abetted, in some accounts, by &quot;Cilician pirates&quot;&amp;nbsp;‚Äì or its aftermath</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and that Pompey then attended to the largest of these alliances, centered on the coast of &quot;Rough [[Cilicia]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Approximate to Southern Turkey</span>
				<span class='text'>Once a Seleucid province, in Pompey's day and for some time to come it was a semi-independent territory whose sovereignty was debated by neighbouring Greek polities</span>
				<span class='text'>It resisted such claims, but was eventually absorbed into Rome's empire</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; After &quot;defeating&quot; its fleet, he induced its surrender with promises of pardon, and settled many of its people at [[Soli, Cilicia|Soli]], which was henceforward called Pompeiopolis</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Dio, Roman History, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>63&lt;/ref&gt;De Souza (2002) finds that Pompey had officially returned the Cilicians to their own cities, which were ideal bases for piracy and not&amp;nbsp;‚Äì as Dio would have it&amp;nbsp;‚Äì for the dignified reformation of pirates as farmers</span>
				<span class='text'>Pompey's entire campaign is therefore in question; its description as &quot;war&quot; is hyperbole&amp;nbsp;‚Äì some form of treaty or payoff is likely, with Pompey as chief negotiator</span>
				<span class='text'>This was standard practice, but undignified and seldom acknowledged; Rome's generals were supposed to wage and win wars</span>
				<span class='text'>A decade on, in the 50s BC, the Cilicians and pirates in general remained a nuisance to Rome's sea trade</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;De Souza, 176 ff</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In Rome, however, Pompey was hero; once again, he had guaranteed the grain supply</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Plutarch, by the end of the summer of 66&amp;nbsp;BC, his forces had swept the Mediterranean clear of opposition</span>
				<span class='text'>Pompey was hailed as the first man in Rome, ''[[Primus inter pares]]'' (the first among equals)</span>
				<span class='text'>Cicero could not resist a [[panegyric]]:&lt;ref&gt;''pro Lege Manilia'', 12 or ''De Imperio Cn</span>

				<span class='text'>]Pompey spent the rest of that year and the beginning of the next visiting the cities of [[Cilicia]] and [[Pamphylia]], and providing for the government of newly conquered territories</span>
				<span class='text'>In his absence from Rome (66&amp;nbsp;BC), he was nominated to succeed Lucius Licinius [[Lucullus]] as commander in the [[Third Mithridatic War]] against [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]] in the East</span>
				<span class='text'>Pompey's command was proposed by the tribune [[Gaius Manilius]], supported by Caesar and justified by [[Cicero]] in ''pro Lege Manilia''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pompey, the Roman Alexander,P Greenhalg p101-4&lt;/ref&gt; His brother-in-law [[Quintus Metellus Celer]] served underneath him at this time and followed him in his exploits in the East</span>
				<span class='text'>Like the Gabinian law, it was opposed by the aristocracy, but was carried nonetheless</span>
				<span class='text'>ucullus, a [[Plebs|plebeian]] noble, was incensed at the prospect of his replacement by a &quot;new man&quot; such as Pompey</span>
				<span class='text'>The outgoing commander and his replacements traded insults</span>
				<span class='text'>Lucullus called Pompey a &quot;vulture&quot; who fed from the work of others</span>
				<span class='text'>Lucullus was referring not merely to Pompey's new command against Mithridates, but also his claim to have finished the war against Spartacus</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pompey, the Roman Alexander,P Greenhalg p107&lt;/ref&gt;At Pompey's approach, Mithridates strategically withdrew his forces</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Pompey managed to besiege his camp, but could not prevent his enemy from breaking the encirclement and retreating further east</span>
				<span class='text'>But, afterward, near Armenia, Pompey managed to surprise the Pontic army by a daring nocturnal attack and all but destroyed it, leaving the king with no choice but to flee in disarray</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Tigranes the Great]] refused him refuge, so he made his way to his own dominions in the [[Cimmerian Bosporus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Pompey secured a treaty with Tigranes, and in 65&amp;nbsp;BC set out in pursuit of Mithridates, but [[Pompey's Georgian campaign|met resistance]] from the Caucasian [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberians]] and [[Caucasian Albania|Albanians]]</span>

				<span class='text'>161&lt;/ref&gt;Pompey then retraced his steps, wintered at [[Pontus]], and made it into a Roman province</span>
				<span class='text'>In 64&amp;nbsp;BC, he marched into [[History of Syria|Syria]], deposed its king, [[Antiochus XIII Asiaticus]], and reconstituted this, too, as a Roman province</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Boak, History of Rome, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>161&quot;/&gt; In 63&amp;nbsp;BC, he moved south, and established Roman supremacy in [[Phoenicia]] and [[Coele-Syria]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In [[Judea]], Pompey intervened in the civil war between [[Hyrcanus&amp;nbsp;II]], who supported the [[Pharisee]] faction and [[Aristobulus&amp;nbsp;II]], who supported the [[Sadducee]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>The armies of Pompey and Hyrcanus&amp;nbsp;II [[Siege of Jerusalem (63&amp;nbsp;BC)|laid siege to Jerusalem]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After three months, the city fell</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Of the Jews there fell twelve thousand, but of the Romans very few</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> and no small enormities were committed about the [[Holy of Holies|temple]] itself, which, in former ages, had been inaccessible, and seen by none; for Pompey went into it, and not a few of those that were with him also, and saw all that which it was unlawful for any other men to see but only for the high priests</span>
				<span class='text'>There were in that temple the golden table, the holy candlestick, and the pouring vessels, and a great quantity of spices; and besides these there were among the treasures two thousand talents of sacred money: yet did Pompey touch nothing of all this, on account of his regard to religion; and in this point also he acted in a manner that was worthy of his virtue</span>
				<span class='text'>The next day he gave order to those that had the charge of the temple to cleanse it, and to bring what offerings the law required to God; and restored the high priesthood to Hyrcanus, both because he had been useful to him in other respects, and because he hindered the Jews in the country from giving Aristobulus any assistance in his war against him</span>

				<span class='text'>161&quot;/&gt; In all, Pompey had annexed four new provinces to the Republic: [[Bithynia et Pontus]], [[Roman Syria|Syria]], [[Cilicia (Roman province)|Cilicia]], and [[Crete]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In the meantime, Pompey promised his retiring veterans public lands to farm, then dismissed his armies</span>
				<span class='text'>It was a reassuringly traditional gesture, but the Senate remained suspicious</span>
				<span class='text'>They debated and delayed his eastern political settlements&lt;ref&gt;Dio, Roman History, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>178&lt;/ref&gt; and the promised gifts of public land</span>
				<span class='text'>From now on, Pompey seems to have toed a cautious line between his enthusiastic popular supporters and the conservatives who seemed so reluctant to acknowledge his solid achievements</span>
				<span class='text'>It would lead him into unexpected political alliances</span>
				<span class='text'>=Caesar and the First Triumvirate==Although Pompey and Crassus distrusted each other, Crassus' [[tax farming]] clients were being rebuffed at the same time Pompey's veterans were being ignored, and by 61&amp;nbsp;BC, their grievances had pushed them both into an alliance with Caesar, six years younger than Pompey, returning from service in Hispania and ready to seek the [[consul]]ship for 59&amp;nbsp;BC</span>
				<span class='text'>Their political alliance, known subsequently as the [[First Triumvirate]], operated to the benefit of each</span>
				<span class='text'>Pompey and Crassus would make Caesar Consul, and Caesar would use his consular power to promote their claims</span>
				<span class='text'>aesar's consulship of 59 BC brought Pompey land for his veterans, confirmation of his Asian political settlements and a new wife</span>
				<span class='text'>She was Caesar's daughter, [[Julia (daughter of Julius Caesar)|Julia]]; Pompey was said to be besotted by her</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Boak, History of Rome, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>167&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, [[Publius Clodius Pulcher|Clodius]] renounced his patrician status, was adopted into a [[plebeian]] ''gens'' and was elected a [[Tribune of the plebs]]</span>
				<span class='text'>At the end of his consulship, Caesar secured proconsular command in Gaul</span>
				<span class='text'>Pompey was given the [[Roman Governor|governorship]] of Hispania Ulterior, but remained in Rome to oversee [[Rome's grain supply|the grain supply]] as ''curator annonae''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Boak, History of Rome, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>169&quot;&gt;Boak, History of Rome, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>169&lt;/ref&gt;Despite his preoccupation with his new wife, Pompey handled the grain issue well</span>
				<span class='text'>His political acumen was less sure</span>
				<span class='text'>When Clodius turned on him in turn, Pompey defended himself by supporting Cicero's recall from exile (57&amp;nbsp;BC)</span>
				<span class='text'>Once back in Rome, Cicero stepped back into his role as Pompey's defender and Clodius' antagonist, but Pompey himself retreated to his lovely young wife and his theatre plans; such behaviour was not expected of the once dazzling young general</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Boak, History of Rome, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>169&quot;/&gt;Pompey might equally have been obsessed, exhausted and frustrated</span>
				<span class='text'>His own party had not forgiven him for allowing Cicero's expulsion</span>
				<span class='text'>Some tried to persuade him that Crassus was plotting his assassination</span>
				<span class='text'>Meanwhile, Caesar seemed set on outstripping both his colleagues in generalship and popularity</span>
				<span class='text'>y 56 BC, the bonds between the three men were fraying</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Boak, History of Rome, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>169&quot;/&gt;  Caesar called first Crassus, then Pompey, to a secret meeting, the [[Lucca Conference]], in the northern Italian town of [[Lucca]] to rethink their joint strategy</span>
				<span class='text'>They agreed that Pompey and Crassus would again stand for the consulship in 55&amp;nbsp;BC</span>
				<span class='text'>Once elected, they would extend Caesar's command in Gaul by five years</span>
				<span class='text'>At the end of their joint consular year, Crassus would have the influential and lucrative governorship of Syria, and use this as a base to conquer Parthia</span>
				<span class='text'>Pompey would keep Hispania ''in absentia''</span>
				<span class='text'>n 55 BC, Pompey and Crassus were elected as consuls, against a background of bribery, civil unrest and electioneering violence</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Boak, History of Rome, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>170&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theatre of Pompey|Pompey's new theatre]] was inaugurated in the same year</span>
				<span class='text'>It was Rome's first permanent theatre, a gigantic, architecturally daring, self-contained complex on the [[Campus Martius]], complete with shops, multi-service buildings, gardens and a temple to [[Venus Victrix]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The latter connected its donor to Aeneas, a son of Venus and ancestor of Rome itself</span>
				<span class='text'>In its portico, the statuary, paintings and personal wealth of foreign kings could be admired at leisure</span>
				<span class='text'>Pompey's triumph lived on</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Beard, 22-3</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; His theatre made an ideal meeting place for his supporters</span>
				<span class='text'>=From confrontation to war==In 54 BC, Julia, Caesar's only child and Pompey's wife, died in childbirth along with her baby</span>
				<span class='text'> Pompey and Caesar shared their grief and condolences, but Julia's death broke their family bonds</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Holland, Rubicon, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>287&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, [[Marcus Licinius Crassus|Crassus]], his son [[Publius Licinius Crassus (son of triumvir)|Publius]] and most of his army were annihilated by the Parthians at [[Battle of Carrhae|Carrhae]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Caesar, not Pompey, was now Rome's great new general and the fragile balance of power between them was under threat</span>
				<span class='text'>Public anxiety spilled over: rumours circulated that Pompey would be offered dictatorship for the sake of law and order</span>
				<span class='text'>aesar sought a second matrimonial alliance with Pompey, offering his grandniece [[Octavia Minor|Octavia]] (the sister of the future emperor [[Augustus]])</span>
				<span class='text'>This time, though, Pompey refused</span>
				<span class='text'>In 52&amp;nbsp;BC, he married [[Cornelia Metella]], the very young widow of Crassus's son Publius, and the daughter of [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius Scipio Nasica|Caecilius Metellus Scipio]], one of Caesar‚Äôs greatest enemies</span>
				<span class='text'>Pompey was drifting back toward the ''optimates''</span>
				<span class='text'>It can be presumed that they thought him the lesser of two evils</span>
				<span class='text'>n the same year, [[Publius Clodius Pulcher|Clodius]] was murdered</span>
				<span class='text'>When his supporters burned down the [[Curia Hostilia|Senate House]] in retaliation, the Senate appealed to Pompey</span>
				<span class='text'>He reacted with ruthless efficiency</span>
				<span class='text'>Cicero, defending the accused murderer [[Titus Annius Milo]], was so shaken by a [[Roman Forum|Forum]] seething with armed soldiers, he was unable to complete his defense</span>
				<span class='text'>nce order was restored, the Senate and [[Cato the Younger|Cato]] avoided granting Pompey dictatorship&amp;nbsp;‚Äì it recalled Sulla and his bloody proscriptions</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead they made him sole Consul; this gave him sweeping, but limited, powers</span>
				<span class='text'>A Dictator could not be lawfully punished for measures taken during his office</span>
				<span class='text'>As sole Consul, Pompey would be answerable for his actions once out of office</span>
				<span class='text'>hile Caesar was fighting against [[Vercingetorix]] in [[Gaul]], Pompey proceeded with a legislative agenda for Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>Its details suggested covert alliance with Caesar's enemies: among his various legal and military reforms was a law allowing retrospective prosecution for electoral bribery</span>
				<span class='text'>Caesar's allies correctly interpreted this as a threat to Caesar once his ''imperium'' ended</span>
				<span class='text'> Pompey also prohibited Caesar from standing for the consulship ''in absentia'', though this had been permitted under past laws</span>
				<span class='text'>his seemed to put paid to Caesar's plans after his term in Gaul expired</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally, in 51&amp;nbsp;BC, Pompey was more forthright; Caesar would not be permitted to stand for Consul unless he relinquished his armies</span>
				<span class='text'>This would, of course, leave Caesar defenseless before his enemies</span>
				<span class='text'>As Cicero sadly noted, Pompey had been diminished by age, uncertainty, his fear of Caesar and the strain of being the chosen tool of a quarreling oligarchy of ''optimates''</span>
				<span class='text'>The coming conflict seemed inevitable</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Many historians have suggested Pompey was, in spite of everything, politically unaware of the fact that the optimates, including Cato, were merely using him against Caesar so that, with Caesar destroyed, they could then dispose of him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Civil war and assassination=={{Main|Caesar's civil war}}[[File:La Fuite de Pomp√©e</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|''The Flight of Pompey after Pharsalus'', by [[Jean Fouquet]]]]In the beginning, Pompey claimed he could defeat Caesar and raise armies merely by stamping his foot on the soil of Italy, but by the spring of 49&amp;nbsp;BC, with Caesar [[crossing the Rubicon]] and his invading legions sweeping down the peninsula, Pompey ordered the abandonment of Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>His legions retreated south towards [[Brundisium]], where Pompey intended to find renewed strength by waging war against Caesar in the east</span>
				<span class='text'>By using his strategic resources in the East, as well as his naval strength to defeat Caesar's forces</span>
				<span class='text'>In the process, neither Pompey nor the Senate thought of taking the vast treasury with them, probably thinking Caesar would not dare take it for himself</span>
				<span class='text'>It was left conveniently in the [[Temple of Saturn]] when Caesar and his forces entered Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>arely eluding Caesar in Brundisium, Pompey crossed over into [[Epirus]], where, during Caesar's Spanish campaign, Pompey had gathered a large force in Macedonia, comprising nine legions reinforced by contingents from the Roman allies in the east</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Boak, History of Rome, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>176&quot;&gt;Boak, History of Rome, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>176&lt;/ref&gt; His fleet, recruited from the maritime cities in the east, controlled the [[Adriatic]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, Caesar managed to cross over into Epirus in November 49&amp;nbsp;BC, and proceeded to capture [[Apollonia, Illyria|Apollonia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Boak, History of Rome, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>176&quot;/&gt;Pompey managed to arrive in time to save [[Dyrrhachium]], and he then attempted to wait Caesar out during the [[Battle of Dyrrhachium (48&amp;nbsp;BC)|siege of Dyrrhachium]], scoring a victory</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet, by failing to pursue at the critical moment of Caesar's defeat, Pompey threw away the chance to destroy Caesar's much smaller army</span>
				<span class='text'>As Caesar himself said, &quot;Today the enemy would have won, if they had a commander who was a winner&quot; (Plutarch,&amp;nbsp;65E)</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to [[Suetonius]], it was at this point that Caesar said that &quot;that man (Pompey) does not know how to win a war</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; With Caesar on their backs, the conservatives led by Pompey fled to Greece</span>
				<span class='text'>Caesar and Pompey had their final showdown at the [[Battle of Pharsalus]] in 48&amp;nbsp;BC</span>
				<span class='text'>The fighting was bitter for both sides, and although Pompey was expected to win, due to advantage in numbers, the brilliant tactics and the superior fighting abilities of Caesar's veterans led to a victory for Caesar</span>
				<span class='text'>Pompey met his wife Cornelia and his son [[Sextus Pompeius]] on the island of [[Mytilene]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He then wondered where to go next</span>
				<span class='text'>The decision of running to one of the eastern kingdoms was overruled in favour of [[Egypt]]</span>
				<span class='text'>fter his arrival in Egypt, Pompey's fate was decided by the counselors of the young king [[Ptolemy&amp;nbsp;XIII]]</span>
				<span class='text'>While Pompey waited offshore, they argued the cost of offering him refuge with Caesar already en route to Egypt; the king's eunuch [[Pothinus]] won out</span>
				<span class='text'>In the final dramatic passages of his biography, Plutarch had Cornelia watch anxiously from the trireme as Pompey left in a small boat with a few sullen, silent comrades, and headed for what appeared to be a welcoming party on the Egyptian shore at [[Pelusium]]</span>
				<span class='text'>As Pompey rose to disembark, he was stabbed to death by his betrayers, [[Achillas]], [[Lucius Septimius|Septimius]] and Salvius</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Plutarch, Pompey, 79‚Äì80&quot;&gt;Plutarch, Pompey, 79‚Äì80&lt;/ref&gt;Plutarch has him meet his fate with great dignity, on his 60th birthday</span>
				<span class='text'>His body remained on the shoreline, to be cremated by his loyal freeman Philip on the rotten planks of a fishing boat</span>
				<span class='text'>His head and seal were presented to Caesar, who, according to Plutarch, mourned this insult to the greatness of his former ally and son-in-law, and punished his assassins and their Egyptian co-conspirators, putting both Achillas and Pothinus to death</span>
				<span class='text'>Pompey's ashes were eventually returned to Cornelia, who carried them to his country house near [[Alba Longa|Alba]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Plutarch, Pompey, 79‚Äì80&quot;/&gt;[[Cassius Dio]] describes Caesar's reactions with skepticism, and considers Pompey's own political misjudgments, rather than treachery, as instrumental in his downfall</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Pompey the great'', John Leach&lt;/ref&gt; At times, he was reluctant to risk an open battle</span>
				<span class='text'>While not hugely charismatic, Pompey could display tremendous bravery and fighting skills on the battlefield, something which provided inspiration to his men</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pompey the great, John Leach&quot;&gt;Pompey the great, John Leach&lt;/ref&gt; While being a superb commander, Pompey also earned a reputation for stealing other generals' victories</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Brice, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>145&lt;/ref&gt;On the other hand, Pompey is usually considered an outstanding strategist and organizer, who could win campaigns without displaying genius on the battlefield, but simply by constantly outmaneuvering his opponents and gradually pushing them into a desperate situation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;John Leach&lt;/ref&gt; Pompey was a great forward planner, and had tremendous organizational skill, which allowed him to devise grand strategies and operate effectively with large armies</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Pharsalus'', Si Sheppard&lt;/ref&gt; During his campaigns in the east, he acted like a sledgehammer, relentlessly pursuing his enemies, and choosing the ground for his battles</span>
				<span class='text'>bove all, he was often able to adapt to his enemies</span>
				<span class='text'>On many occasions, he acted very swiftly and decisively, as he did during his campaigns in Sicily and Africa, or against the Cilician pirates</span>
				<span class='text'>During the Sertorian war, on the other hand, Pompey was beaten several times by Sertorius</span>
				<span class='text'>Therefore, he decided to resort to a war of attrition, in which he would avoid open battles against his chief opponent but instead try to gradually regain the strategic advantage by capturing his fortresses and cities and defeating his junior officers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pompey the great, John Leach&quot;/&gt; In some instances, Sertorius showed up and forced Pompey to abandon a siege, only to see him strike somewhere else</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Appian&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy was not spectacular but it led to constant territorial gains and did much to demoralize the Sertorian forces</span>
				<span class='text'>By 72 BC, the year of his assassination, Sertorius was already in a desperate situation and his troops were deserting</span>
				<span class='text'>Against Perpenna, a tactician far inferior to his former commander in chief, Pompey decided to revert to a more aggressive strategy and he scored a decisive victory that effectively ended the war</span>
				<span class='text'>gainst Caesar too, his strategy was sound</span>
				<span class='text'>During the campaign of Greece, he managed to regain the initiative, join his forces to that of Metellus Scipio (something that Caesar wanted to avoid) and trap his enemy</span>
				<span class='text'>His strategic position was hence much better than that of Caesar and could have starved his army to death</span>
				<span class='text'>However, he was finally compelled to fight an open battle by his allies and his conventional tactics proved no match to that of Caesar and his better-trained troops</span>
				<span class='text'>=Later portrayals and reputation==For the historians of his own and later Roman periods, Pompey fit the trope of the great man who achieved extraordinary triumphs through his own efforts, yet fell from power and was, in the end, murdered through treachery</span>
				<span class='text'>e was a hero of the Republic, who seemed once to hold the Roman world in his palm, only to be brought low by Caesar</span>
				<span class='text'>Pompey was idealized as a tragic hero almost immediately after Pharsalus and his murder</span>
				<span class='text'>Plutarch portrayed him as a Roman [[Alexander the Great]], pure of heart and mind, destroyed by the cynical ambitions of those around him</span>
				<span class='text'>This portrayal of him survived into the [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] periods, for example in [[Pierre Corneille|Corneille]]'s play ''[[The Death of Pompey]]'' (1642)</span>
				<span class='text'>In spite of his war against Caesar, Pompey was still widely celebrated during the imperial period, as the conqueror of the orient</span>
				<span class='text'>At Augustus' funeral procession, pictures of him were carried as he was still widely considered as the great conqueror of the Orient</span>
				<span class='text'>As a triumphator, he also had numerous statues in Rome, one of which was on the forum of Augustus</span>
				<span class='text'>Though the imperial power did not honor him as much as his archenemy, who was considered a god, his reputation among many aristocrats and historians was equal or even superior to that of Caesar</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pompey, Eric Teyssier&lt;/ref&gt;Pompey has appeared as a character in several modern novels, plays, motion pictures, and other media</span>
				<span class='text'>==Theater, film and television===*A theatrical portrayal was [[John Masefield]]'s play ''[[The Tragedy of Pompey the Great]]'' (1910)</span>

				<span class='text'>In the television series ''[[Spartacus: War of the Damned]]'', he is portrayed by actor [[Joel Tobeck]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==Literature===*In [[Colleen McCullough]]'s ''[[Masters of Rome]]'' series of historical novels, Pompey's youthful exploits are depicted in ''[[Fortune's Favorites]]'', the formation of the First Triumvirate and his marriage to Julia is a large part of ''[[Caesar's Women]]'' and his loss of Julia, the dissolution of the First Triumvirate, his later political career, the civil war between him and Caesar and his eventual defeat and his betrayal and murder in Egypt are all told in ''[[Caesar (novel)|Caesar]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>In comics, he appears as Julius Caesar's foe throughout the ''[[The Adventures of Alix]]'' series</span>
				<span class='text'>Pompey is a recurring character in the ''[[Roma Sub Rosa]]'' series of novels by [[Steven Saylor]], portraying his role in the Civil War with Caesar</span>
				<span class='text'> His final appearance is in Saylor's novel ''[[The Judgment of Caesar]]'', graphically depicting his murder by Ptolemy in Egypt</span>
				<span class='text'>Pompey also appears frequently in the [[SPQR series]] by [[John Maddox Roberts]], narrated by Senator [[Decius Metellus]], a fictional nephew of Caecilius [[Metellus Pius]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Decius despises Pompey as a glory-seeker and credit-grabber, while acknowledging that he is a political dunce who was eventually swept up into the ''optimates'' feud with Caesar</span>
				<span class='text'>Pompey is a major recurring character in [[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]]'s trilogy of the life of [[Cicero]], (''Imperium'', ''Lustrum'' and ''Dictator''), in which Pompey is portrayed as bombastic and dim-witted, though fearsome</span>
