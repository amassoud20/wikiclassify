				<span class='text'>vg}}'''Frank Lloyd Wright''' (born '''Frank Lincoln Wright''', June 8, 1867 – April 9, 1959) was an American architect, interior designer, writer, and educator, who designed more than 1,000 structures, 532 of which were completed</span>
				<span class='text'>Wright believed in designing structures that were in harmony with humanity and its environment, a philosophy he called [[organic architecture]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This philosophy was best exemplified by [[Fallingwater]] (1935), which has been called &quot;the best all-time work of American architecture&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Brewster&quot; /&gt; Wright was a leader of the [[Prairie School]] movement of architecture and developed the concept of the [[Usonia]]n home, his unique vision for urban planning in the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>Frank Lloyd Wright was an architect for about 70 years</span>
				<span class='text'>is work includes original and innovative examples of many building types, including offices, churches, schools, skyscrapers, hotels, and museums</span>
				<span class='text'>Wright also designed many of the interior elements of his buildings, such as the furniture and [[stained glass]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Wright wrote 20 books and many articles and was a popular lecturer in the United States and in Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>His colorful personal life often made headlines, most notably for the 1914 fire and murders at his [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin studio]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Already well known during his lifetime, Wright was recognized in 1991 by the [[American Institute of Architects]] as &quot;the greatest American architect of all time&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Brewster&quot; /&gt;==Early years{{anchor | Biography}}==Frank Lloyd Wright was born Frank Lincoln Wright in the farming town of [[Richland Center, Wisconsin|Richland Center]], Wisconsin, United States, in 1867</span>
				<span class='text'>His father, William Carey Wright (1825–1904), was a locally admired orator, music teacher, occasional lawyer, and itinerant minister</span>
				<span class='text'>William Wright met and married Anna Lloyd Jones (1838/39 – 1923), a county school teacher, the previous year when he was employed as the superintendent of schools for [[Richland County, Wisconsin|Richland County]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Originally from [[Massachusetts]], William Wright had been a [[Baptist]] minister, but he later joined his wife's family in the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] faith</span>
				<span class='text'>Anna was a member of the large, prosperous and well-known Lloyd Jones family of Unitarians, who had emigrated from [[Wales]] to Spring Green, Wisconsin</span>
				<span class='text'>One of Anna's brothers was [[Jenkin Lloyd Jones]], who would become an important figure in the spread of the Unitarian faith in the Western United States</span>
				<span class='text'>Both of Wright's parents were strong-willed individuals with idiosyncratic interests that they passed on to him</span>
				<span class='text'>According to his biography, his mother declared when she was expecting her first child he would grow up to build beautiful buildings</span>
				<span class='text'>She decorated his nursery with engravings of English cathedrals torn from a periodical to encourage the infant's ambition</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Secrest|first=Meryle|title=Frank Lloyd Wright: A Biography|year=1998|publisher=University of Chicago Press|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family moved to [[Weymouth, Massachusetts|Weymouth]], Massachusetts in 1870 for William to minister a small congregation</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1876, Anna visited the [[Centennial Exhibition]] in [[Philadelphia]] and saw an exhibit of educational blocks created by [[Friedrich Fröbel|Friedrich Wilhelm August Fröbel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The blocks, known as [[Froebel Gifts]], were the foundation of his innovative [[kindergarten]] curriculum</span>
				<span class='text'>A trained teacher, Anna was excited by the program and bought a set of blocks for her family</span>
				<span class='text'>Young Wright spent much time playing with the blocks</span>
				<span class='text'>These were geometrically shaped and could be assembled in various combinations to form three-dimensional compositions</span>
				<span class='text'>This is how Wright described, in his autobiography, the influence of these exercises on his approach to design: &quot;For several years I sat at the little Kindergarten table-top&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>and played&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>

				<span class='text'>82&lt;/ref&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1887, Wright left the school without taking a degree (although he was granted an honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts from the University in 1955) and arrived in Chicago in search of employment</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result of the devastating [[Great Chicago Fire of 1871]] and recent population boom, new development was plentiful in the city</span>
				<span class='text'>He later recalled that his first impressions of Chicago were that of grimy neighborhoods, crowded streets, and disappointing architecture, yet he was determined to find work</span>
				<span class='text'>Within days, and after interviews with several prominent firms, he was hired as a [[Technical drawing|draftsman]] with the architectural firm of [[Joseph Lyman Silsbee]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Wright /&gt; Wright previously collaborated with Silsbee—accredited as the draftsman and the construction supervisor—on the 1886 [[Unity Chapel]] for Wright's family in [[Spring Green, Wisconsin|Spring Green]], Wisconsin</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=FLWF /&gt;While with the firm, he also worked on two other family projects: All Souls Church in Chicago for his uncle, Jenkin Lloyd Jones, and the Hillside Home School I in Spring Green for two of his aunts</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=OGorman /&gt; Other draftsmen who worked for Silsbee in 1887 included future architects Cecil Corwin, [[George W</span>
				<span class='text'>Maher]], and [[George Grant Elmslie|George G</span>
				<span class='text'>Elmslie]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Wright soon befriended Corwin, with whom he lived until he found a permanent home</span>
				<span class='text'>n his autobiography, Wright recounts that he also had a short stint in another Chicago architecture office</span>
				<span class='text'>Feeling that he was underpaid for the quality of his work for Silsbee (at $8 a week), the young draftsman quit and found work as a [[Architectural designer|designer]] at the firm of Beers, Clay, and Dutton</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Wright soon realized that he was not ready to handle building design by himself; he left his new job to return to Joseph Silsbee—this time with a raise in salary</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;Although Silsbee adhered mainly to [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] and [[Revivalism (architecture)|revivalist]] architecture, Wright found his work to be more &quot;gracefully picturesque&quot; than the other &quot;brutalities&quot; of the period</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, Wright aspired for more progressive work</span>
				<span class='text'>After less than a year had passed in Silsbee's office, Wright learned that the Chicago firm of [[Dankmar Adler|Adler]] &amp; [[Louis Sullivan|Sullivan]] was &quot;looking for someone to make the finish drawings for the interior of the [[Auditorium Building|Auditorium [Building]]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wright demonstrated that he was a competent impressionist of [[Louis Sullivan]]'s ornamental designs and two short interviews later, was an official [[Apprenticeship|apprentice]] in the firm</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;==Adler &amp; Sullivan (1888–1893){{anchor | Adler &amp; Sullivan}}==Wright did not get along well with Sullivan's other draftsmen; he wrote that several violent altercations occurred between them during the first years of his apprenticeship</span>
				<span class='text'>For that matter, Sullivan showed very little respect for his employees as well</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2005|pp=89–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of this, &quot;Sullivan took [Wright] under his wing and gave him great design responsibility</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; As an act of respect, Wright would later refer to Sullivan as ''Lieber Meister'' (German for &quot;Dear Master&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Tafel /&gt; He also formed a bond with office foreman Paul Mueller</span>
				<span class='text'>Wright would later engage Mueller to build several of his public and commercial buildings between 1903 and 1923</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Saint /&gt;[[File:Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio (west side zoom)</span>
				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|[[Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio|Wright's home]] in [[Oak Park, Illinois|Oak Park]], Illinois]]On June 1, 1889, Wright married his first wife, Catherine Lee &quot;Kitty&quot; Tobin (1871–1959)</span>
				<span class='text'>The two had met around a year earlier during activities at All Souls Church</span>
				<span class='text'>Sullivan did his part to facilitate the financial success of the young couple by granting Wright a five-year employment contract</span>
				<span class='text'>Wright made one more request: &quot;Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Sullivan, if you want me to work for you as long as five years, couldn't you lend me enough money to build a little house?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wright 2005, p</span>
				<span class='text'>97&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Sullivan's $5,000 loan, Wright purchased a lot at the corner of Chicago and Forest Avenues in the suburb of [[Oak Park, Illinois|Oak Park]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The existing [[Gothic Revival]] house was given to his mother, while a compact [[Shingle style]] house was built alongside for Wright and Catherine</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Weil /&gt;According to an 1890 diagram of the firm's new, 17th floor space atop the Auditorium Building, Wright soon earned a private office next to Sullivan's own</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Saint/&gt; However, that office was actually shared with friend and draftsman George Elmslie, who was hired by Sullivan at Wright's request</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Gebhard /&gt; Wright had risen to head draftsman and handled all residential design work in the office</span>
				<span class='text'>As a general rule, Adler &amp; Sullivan did not design or build houses, but they obliged when asked by the clients of their important commercial projects</span>
				<span class='text'>Wright was occupied by the firm's major commissions during office hours, so house designs were relegated to evening and weekend overtime hours at his home studio</span>
				<span class='text'>He would later claim total responsibility for the design of these houses, but careful inspection of their architectural style and accounts from historian Robert Twombly suggest that it was Sullivan who dictated the overall form and motifs of the residential works; Wright's design duties were often reduced to detailing the projects from Sullivan's sketches</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Gebhard/&gt; During this time, Wright worked on [[Louis Sullivan Bungalow|Sullivan's bungalow]] (1890) and the James A</span>
				<span class='text'>Charnley bungalow (1890) both in [[Ocean Springs, Mississippi|Ocean Springs]], Mississippi, the Berry-MacHarg House (1891) and Louis Sullivan's House (1892) both in Chicago, and the most noted 1891 [[James A</span>
				<span class='text'>Charnley House]] also in Chicago</span>
				<span class='text'>Of the five collaborations, only the two commissions for the Charnley family still stand</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lind /&gt;[[File:Oak Park Il Walter Gale House4</span>

				<span class='text'>Wright admitted that his poor finances were likely due to his expensive tastes in wardrobe and vehicles, and the extra luxuries he designed into his house</span>
				<span class='text'>To compound the problem, Wright's children — including first born [[Lloyd Wright|Lloyd]] (born 1890) and [[John Lloyd Wright|John]] (born 1892) — would share similar tastes for fine goods</span>

				<span class='text'>7</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; To supplement his income and repay his debts, Wright accepted independent commissions for at least nine houses</span>
				<span class='text'>These &quot;bootlegged&quot; houses, as he later called them, were conservatively designed in variations of the fashionable [[Queen Anne Style architecture (United States)|Queen Anne]] and [[Colonial Revival architecture|Colonial Revival]] styles</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, unlike the prevailing architecture of the period, each house emphasized simple geometric massing and contained features such as bands of horizontal windows, occasional [[cantilever]]s, and open floor plans which would become hallmarks of his later work</span>
				<span class='text'>Eight of these early houses remain today including the [[Thomas H</span>
				<span class='text'>Gale House|Thomas Gale]], [[Robert P</span>
				<span class='text'>Parker House]], George Blossom, and [[Walter Gale House|Walter Gale]] houses</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Gorman|2004|pp=38–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;As with the residential projects for Adler &amp; Sullivan, he designed his bootleg houses on his own time</span>
				<span class='text'>Sullivan knew nothing of the independent works until 1893, when he recognized that one of the houses was unmistakably a Frank Lloyd Wright design</span>
				<span class='text'>This particular house, built for Allison Harlan, was only blocks away from Sullivan's townhouse in the Chicago community of [[Kenwood, Chicago|Kenwood]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Aside from the location, the geometric purity of the composition and balcony [[tracery]] in the same style as the Charnley House likely gave away Wright's involvement</span>
				<span class='text'>Since Wright's five-year contract forbade any outside work, the incident led to his departure from Sullivan's firm</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Lind/&gt; A variety of stories recount the break in the relationship between Sullivan and Wright; even Wright later told two different versions of the occurrence</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''An Autobiography'', Wright claimed that he was unaware that his side ventures were a breach of his contract</span>
				<span class='text'>When Sullivan learned of them, he was angered and offended; he prohibited any further outside commissions and refused to issue Wright the [[deed]] to his Oak Park house until after he completed his five years</span>
				<span class='text'>Wright could not bear the new hostility from his master and thought the situation was unjust</span>
				<span class='text'>He &quot;threw down [his] pencil and walked out of the Adler and Sullivan office never to return</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Dankmar Adler, who was more sympathetic to Wright's actions, later sent him the deed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Wright told his [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin]] apprentices (as recorded by Edgar Tafel) that Sullivan fired him on the spot upon learning of the Harlan House</span>
				<span class='text'>Tafel also accounted that Wright had Cecil Corwin sign several of the bootleg jobs, indicating that Wright was aware of their illegal nature</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Lind/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tafel|1985|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the correct series of events, Wright and Sullivan did not meet or speak for twelve years</span>
				<span class='text'>=Transition and experimentation (1893–1900)==After leaving Louis Sullivan, Wright established his own practice on the top floor of the Sullivan designed [[Schiller Building]] (1892, demolished 1961) on [[Randolph Street (Chicago)|Randolph Street]] in Chicago</span>
				<span class='text'>Wright chose to locate his office in the building because the tower location reminded him of the office of Adler &amp; Sullivan</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Cecil Corwin followed Wright and set up his architecture practice in the same office, the two worked independently and did not consider themselves partners</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a year, Corwin decided that he did not enjoy architecture and journeyed east to find a new profession</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2005|pp=118–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;With Corwin gone, Wright moved out of the Schiller Building and into the nearby and newly completed [[Steinway Hall (Chicago)|Steinway Hall]] Building</span>
				<span class='text'>The loft space was shared with [[Robert C</span>
				<span class='text'>Spencer, Jr</span>
				<span class='text'>], [[Myron Hunt]], and [[Dwight H</span>
				<span class='text'>Perkins (architect)|Dwight H</span>
				<span class='text'>Perkins]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; These young architects, inspired by the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]] and the philosophies of Louis Sullivan, formed what would become known as the [[Prairie School]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brooks /&gt; They were joined by Perkins apprentice, [[Marion Mahony Griffin|Marion Mahony]], who in 1895 transferred to Wright's team of drafters and took over production of his [[Architectural drawing#Presentation drawings|presentation drawings]] and watercolor [[Architectural rendering|renderings]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Mahony, the third woman to be licensed as an architect in Illinois and one of the first licensed female architects in the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> also designed furniture, leaded glass windows, and light fixtures, among other features, for Wright's houses</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Cassidy /&gt;&lt;ref name=MIT /&gt; Between 1894 and the early 1910s, several other leading Prairie School architects and many of Wright's future employees launched their careers in the offices of Steinway Hall</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|[[William H</span>
				<span class='text'>Winslow House]] (1893) in [[River Forest, Illinois|River Forest]], Illinois]]Wright's projects during this period followed two basic models</span>
				<span class='text'>On one hand, there was his first independent commission, the [[Winslow House (River Forest, Illinois)|Winslow House]], which combined Sullivanesque ornamentation with the emphasis on simple geometry and horizontal lines that is typical in Wright houses</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Francis Apartments]] (1895, demolished 1971), [[Heller House]] (1896), [[Rollin Furbeck House]] (1897), and [[Husser House]] (1899, demolished 1926) were designed in the same mode</span>
				<span class='text'>For more conservative clients, Wright conceded to design more traditional dwellings</span>
				<span class='text'>These included the [[Dutch Colonial Revival architecture|Dutch Colonial Revival]] style [[Frederick Bagley House|Bagley House]] (1894), [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor Revival]] style [[Nathan G</span>
				<span class='text'>Moore House|Moore House I]] (1895), and [[Queen Anne Style architecture (United States)|Queen Anne]] style [[Charles E</span>
				<span class='text'>Roberts]] House (1896)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Gorman|2004|pp=56–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an emerging architect, Wright could not afford to turn down clients over disagreements in taste, but even his most conservative designs retained simplified massing and occasional Sullivan inspired details</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;Soon after the completion of the Winslow House in 1894, Edward Waller, a friend and former client, invited Wright to meet Chicago architect and planner [[Daniel Burnham]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Burnham had been impressed by the Winslow House and other examples of Wright's work; he offered to finance a four-year education at the [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts|École des Beaux-Arts]] and two years in Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>To top it off, Wright would have a position in Burnham's firm upon his return</span>
				<span class='text'>In spite of guaranteed success and support of his family, Wright declined the offer</span>
				<span class='text'>Burnham, who had directed the classical design of the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] was a major proponent of the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux Arts movement]], thought that Wright was making a foolish mistake</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet for Wright, the classical education of the École lacked creativity and was altogether at odds with his vision of modern American architecture</span>

				<span class='text'>Moore House]] (1895), Oak Park, IL]]Wright relocated his practice to his home in 1898 in order to bring his work and family lives closer</span>
				<span class='text'>This move made further sense as the majority of the architect's projects at that time were in Oak Park or neighboring [[River Forest, Illinois|River Forest]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The past five years had seen the birth of three more children — [[Kitty Wright|Catherine]] in 1894, [[David Samuel Wright|David]] in 1895, and [[Frances Wright Cuppley|Frances]] in 1898 — prompting Wright to sacrifice his original home studio space for additional bedrooms</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, moving his workspace necessitated his design and construction of an expansive [[Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio|studio addition]] to the north of the main house</span>
				<span class='text'>The space, which included a hanging [[balcony]] within the two story drafting room, was one of Wright's first experiments with innovative structure</span>
				<span class='text'>The studio was a poster for Wright's developing aesthetics and would become the laboratory from which the next ten years of architectural creations would emerge</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Prairie houses==By 1901, Wright had completed about 50 projects, including many houses in Oak Park</span>
				<span class='text'>As his son John Lloyd Wright wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt; &quot;[[William Eugene Drummond]], Francis [[Barry Byrne]], [[Walter Burley Griffin]], [[Albert Chase McArthur]], [[Marion Mahony Griffin|Marion Mahony]], [[Isabel Roberts]] and [[George Willis (architect)|George Willis]] were the draftsmen</span>
				<span class='text'>Five men, two women</span>
				<span class='text'>They wore flowing ties, and smocks suitable to the realm</span>
				<span class='text'>The men wore their hair like Papa, all except Albert, he didn't have enough hair</span>
				<span class='text'>They worshiped Papa! Papa liked them!

				<span class='text'>Two, the [[Warren Hickox House|Hickox]] and [[B</span>
				<span class='text'>Harley Bradley House|Bradley Houses]], were the last transitional step between Wright's early designs and the Prairie creations</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Clayton /&gt; Meanwhile, the [[Frank Thomas House|Thomas House]] and [[Willits House]] received recognition as the first mature examples of the new style</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Sommer /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Gorman|2004|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Wright gave his new ideas for the American house widespread awareness through two publications in the ''[[Ladies' Home Journal]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The articles were in response to an invitation from the president of [[Curtis Publishing Company]], [[Edward Bok]], as part of a project to improve modern house design</span>
				<span class='text'>Bok also extended the offer to other architects, but Wright was the sole responder</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;A Home in a Prairie Town&quot; and &quot;A Small House with Lots of Room in it&quot; appeared respectively in the February and July 1901 issues of the journal</span>
				<span class='text'>Although neither of the affordable house plans were ever constructed, Wright received increased requests for similar designs in following years</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Clayton/&gt;Wright's residential designs were known as &quot;prairie houses&quot; because the designs complemented the land around Chicago</span>
				<span class='text'>These houses featured extended low buildings with shallow, sloping roofs, clean sky lines, suppressed chimneys, [[Overhang (architecture)|overhang]]s and terraces all using unfinished materials</span>
				<span class='text'>The houses are credited with being the first examples of the &quot;[[open plan]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Windows whenever possible are long, and low, allowing a connection between the interior and nature, outside, that was new to western architecture and reflected the influence of Japanese architecture on Wright</span>
				<span class='text'>The manipulation of interior space in residential and public buildings are hallmarks of his style</span>
				<span class='text'>ublic buildings in the Prairie style include [[Unity Temple]], the home of the Unitarian Universalist congregation in Oak Park</span>
				<span class='text'>As a lifelong [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] and member of Unity Temple, Wright offered his services to the congregation after their church burned down in 1905</span>
				<span class='text'>The community agreed to hire him and he worked on the building from 1905 to 1909</span>
				<span class='text'>Wright later said that Unity Temple was the edifice in which he ceased to be an architect of structure, and became an architect of space</span>
				<span class='text'>Many architects consider it the world's first modern building, because of its unique construction of only one material: reinforced concrete</span>
				<span class='text'>This would become a hallmark of the modernists who followed Wright, such as Mies van der Rohe, and even some post-modernists, such as Frank Gehry</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1902, the Larkin Company decided to build a new administration building</span>

				<span class='text'>The work contained more than 100 [[lithograph]]s of Wright's designs and was commonly known as the [[Wasmuth Portfolio]]</span>
				<span class='text'>right remained in Europe for almost a year and set up home first in [[Florence, Italy]] — where he lived with his eldest son Lloyd — and later in [[Fiesole, Italy]] where he lived with Mamah</span>
				<span class='text'>During this time, Edwin Cheney granted Mamah a divorce, though Kitty still refused to grant one to her husband</span>
				<span class='text'>After Wright's return to the United States in October 1910, Wright persuaded his mother to buy land for him in [[Spring Green, Wisconsin|Spring Green]], Wisconsin</span>

				<span class='text'>The recurring theme of Taliesin also came from his mother's side: [[Taliesin]] in [[Welsh mythology]] was a poet, magician, and priest</span>

				<span class='text'>Under the terms of the divorce, Wright was required to wait one year before he could marry his then-partner, Maude &quot;Miriam&quot; Noel</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1923, Wright's mother, Anna (Lloyd Jones) Wright, died</span>
				<span class='text'>Wright wed Miriam Noel in November 1923, but her addiction to [[morphine]] led to the failure of the marriage in less than one year</span>

				<span class='text'>=California and the textile block houses==In the 1920s, Wright designed a number of houses in California using precast &quot;textile&quot; concrete blocks reinforced by an internal system of bars</span>
				<span class='text'>Wright first used his textile block system on the [[John Storer House]] in Hollywood, California, in 1923</span>
				<span class='text'>The house is now used in films, television, and print media to represent the future</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;loc&quot; /&gt; Typically Wrightian is the joining of the structure to its site by a series of terraces that reach out into and reorder the landscape, making it an integral part of the architect's vision</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;loc&quot;/&gt; According to Wright's organic theory, all components of the building should appear unified, as though they belong together</span>
				<span class='text'>Nothing should be attached to it without considering the effect on the whole</span>
				<span class='text'>To unify the house to its site, Wright often used large expanses of glass to blur the boundary between the indoors and outdoors</span>

				<span class='text'>tm|publisher=TMCnet|accessdate=February 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The textile block system arose from Wright's desire to wed machine-age production techniques with organic architecture – the principle that a structure should look as though it naturally grew on a site – so as to make his designs affordable to people of modest means</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Frank Lloyd Wright LC-USZ62-36384</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|200px|Wright in 1926]]According to the original specifications, the blocks were to be made from one part [[Portland cement]] to four parts sand or decomposed granite</span>
				<span class='text'>Consistency was to be such that the mixture would hold its shape when squeezed by hand, and it was to be used within a half hour</span>
				<span class='text'>Blocks were to be formed on site by pressing the stiff mixture into machined metal molds</span>
				<span class='text'>A freshly formed block was to be removed immediately from the mold and kept moist for at least 10 days</span>
				<span class='text'>The module for the Storer House was 16 in</span>
				<span class='text'>and the actual block dimensions were exactly 16 × 16 in</span>
				<span class='text'>with no tolerance</span>
				<span class='text'>There was no mortar joint between the blocks-a formed reveal was used to give the appearance of a tooled joint-so precision-machined molds were required</span>
				<span class='text'>The wall system consisted of a double-wythe precast block wall with an air gap between the outer and inner wythes</span>
				<span class='text'>The blocks were stacked and reinforced horizontally and vertically with a &quot;fabric&quot; or mesh of grouted reinforcing bars</span>
				<span class='text'>he [[Samuel Freeman House]] was also built in 1923</span>
				<span class='text'>Wright was commissioned to design a home for Samuel and Harriet Freeman in the [[Hollywood Hills]] neighborhood of Los Angeles, CA</span>
				<span class='text'>This was to be a relatively small house for a client of modest means</span>
				<span class='text'>Because his new textile block system used inexpensive materials and could (at least in theory) be assembled using unskilled labor, Wright undoubtedly felt that the Freeman project would be a good test case</span>
				<span class='text'>nfortunately, the cost of completion was almost two and a half times Wright's original estimate</span>
				<span class='text'>The cost overruns were probably due to several factors: excessive labor costs resulting from not having a concrete mixer on site, Wright's penchant to embellish his designs and refuse compromise, and delayed communications with the contractor when Wright returned to [[Wisconsin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Wright's original estimate stated that 9000 blocks would be required at a cost of 30 cents each, totaling $2700</span>
				<span class='text'>The project actually required 11,000 blocks at 66 cents each, for a total cost of $7260</span>
				<span class='text'>In spite of the cost overruns, the Freemans loved their house and remained the only owners and occupants until it was bequeathed by Harriet Freeman to the [[University of Southern California]] School of Architecture, Los Angeles, California, in 1986</span>
				<span class='text'>he [[Ennis House]] after in 1923, Wright had the opportunity to further test the limits of the textile block system when he received a commission from Charles and Mabel Ennis to build a home on a hillside in the [[Los Feliz]] area of Los Angeles, California</span>
				<span class='text'>Because the Ennises had the resources for a large house on a grand scale, Wright's budget would not be as constrained as it was with the Freeman House</span>
				<span class='text'>Wright took the opportunity to further flesh out his concept</span>
				<span class='text'>e also designed a fifth textile block house for [[Aline Barnsdall]], the Community Playhouse (&quot;Little Dipper&quot;), which was never constructed</span>
				<span class='text'>Wright's son, Lloyd Wright, supervised construction for the Storer, Freeman and Ennis House</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|[[Weltzheimer/Johnson House|Charles Weltzheimer Residence]] (1948) in Oberlin, Ohio]]{{Main|Usonia}}{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2010}}Concurrent with the development of [[Broadacre City]], also referred to as ''Usonia'', Wright conceived a new type of dwelling that came to be known as the [[Usonia]]n House</span>
				<span class='text'>An early version of the form can be seen in the [[Malcolm Willey House]] (1934) in Minneapolis; but the Usonian ideal emerged most completely in the [[Herbert and Katherine Jacobs First House]] (1937) in Madison, Wisconsin</span>
				<span class='text'>Designed on a gridded concrete slab that integrated the house's radiant heating system, the house featured new approaches to construction, including sandwich walls that consisted of layers of wood siding, plywood cores and building paper, a significant change from typically framed walls</span>
				<span class='text'>Usonian houses most commonly featured flat roofs and were mostly constructed without basements, completing the excision of attics and basements from houses, a feat Wright had been attempting since the early 20th century</span>
				<span class='text'>The Jacobses also commissioned the &quot;Solar Hemicycle&quot; by Wright in 1944, a seminal project in the solar house movement</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Denzerbook&quot; /&gt;Intended to be highly practical houses for middle-class clients, and designed to be run without servants, Usonian houses often featured small kitchens — called &quot;workspaces&quot; by Wright — that adjoined the dining spaces</span>
				<span class='text'>These spaces in turn flowed into the main living areas, which also were characteristically outfitted with built-in seating and tables</span>
				<span class='text'>As in the Prairie Houses, Usonian living areas focused on the fireplace</span>
				<span class='text'>Bedrooms were typically isolated and relatively small, encouraging the family to gather in the main living areas</span>
				<span class='text'>The conception of spaces instead of rooms was a development of the Prairie ideal; as the built-in furnishings related to the Arts and Crafts principles from which Wright's early works grew</span>
				<span class='text'>Spatially and in terms of their construction, the Usonian houses represented a new model for independent living, and allowed dozens of clients to live in a Wright-designed house at relatively low cost</span>
				<span class='text'>The diversity of the Usonian ideal can be seen in houses such as the [[Gregor S</span>
				<span class='text'>and Elizabeth B</span>
				<span class='text'>Affleck House]] (1941) in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, which projects over a ravine; and the [[Hanna-Honeycomb House]] (1937) in Palo Alto, California, which features a honeycomb planning grid</span>

				<span class='text'>Fewer than 60 of Wright's Usonian houses were built</span>
				<span class='text'>is Usonian homes set a new style for suburban design that was a feature of countless developers</span>
				<span class='text'>Many features of modern American homes date back to Wright, including open plans, slab-on-grade foundations, and simplified construction techniques that allowed more mechanization and efficiency in building</span>
				<span class='text'>==Personal style and concepts===Some of the built-in furniture remains, while other restorations have included replacement pieces created using his plans</span>
				<span class='text'>His Prairie houses use themed, coordinated design elements (often based on plant forms) that are repeated in windows, carpets and other fittings</span>
				<span class='text'>He made innovative use of new building materials such as [[precast concrete]] blocks, glass bricks and zinc [[came]]s (instead of the traditional lead) for his leadlight windows, and he famously used [[Pyrex]] glass tubing as a major element in the [[Johnson Wax Headquarters]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Wright was also one of the first architects to design and install custom-made electric light fittings, including some of the very first electric floor lamps, and his very early use of the then-novel spherical glass lampshade (a design previously not possible due to the physical restrictions of gas lighting)</span>
				<span class='text'>s Wright's career progressed, so did the mechanization of the glass industry</span>
				<span class='text'>Wright fully embraced glass in his designs and found that it fit well into his philosophy of organic architecture</span>
				<span class='text'>Glass allowed for interaction and viewing of the outdoors while still protecting from the elements</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1928, Wright wrote an essay on glass in which he compared it to the mirrors of nature: lakes, rivers and ponds</span>
				<span class='text'>One of Wright's earliest uses of glass in his works was to string panes of glass along whole walls in an attempt to create light screens to join together solid walls</span>
				<span class='text'>By utilizing this large amount of glass, Wright sought to achieve a balance between the lightness and airiness of the glass and the solid, hard walls</span>
				<span class='text'>Arguably, Wright's best-known art glass is that of the Prairie style</span>
				<span class='text'>The simple geometric shapes that yield to very ornate and intricate windows represent some of the most integral ornamentation of his career</span>

				<span class='text'>This allowed the woman of the house to work in her 'workspace', as he often called the kitchen, yet keep track of and be available for the children and/or guests in the dining room</span>
				<span class='text'>Much of modern architecture, including the early work of [[Mies van der Rohe]], can be traced back to Wright's innovative work</span>
				<span class='text'>right also designed some of his own clothing</span>
				<span class='text'>His fashion sense was unique and he usually wore expensive suits, flowing neckties, and capes</span>
				<span class='text'>He had a fascination with automobiles, purchasing his first car in 1909, a Stoddard-Dayton roadster, and owned many exotic vehicles over the years</span>
				<span class='text'>During the cash-strapped Depression, Wright drove cheaper vehicles</span>
				<span class='text'>Some of his last cars in the 1950s included four Volkswagens and a Chevrolet Nomad wagon along with flashier articles such as a Jaguar Mark VII</span>
				<span class='text'>He owned some 50 cars between 1909 and his death, of which ten are known to be extant</span>
				<span class='text'>right strongly believed in individualism and did not affiliate with the [[American Institute of Architects]] during his career, going so far as to call the organization &quot;a harbor of refuge for the incompetent,&quot; and &quot;a form of refined gangsterism</span>

				<span class='text'>44&lt;/ref&gt;His thoughts on suburban design started in 1900 with a proposed subdivision layout for [[Charles E</span>
				<span class='text'>Roberts]] entitled the &quot;Quadruple Block Plan</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; This design strayed from traditional suburban lot layouts and set houses on small square blocks of four equal-sized lots surrounded on all sides by roads instead of straight rows of houses on parallel streets</span>
				<span class='text'>The houses, which used the same design as published in &quot;A Home in a Prairie Town&quot; from the ''[[Ladies' Home Journal]]'', were set toward the center of the block to maximize the yard space and included private space in the center</span>
				<span class='text'>This also allowed for far more interesting views from each house</span>
				<span class='text'>Although this plan was never realized, Wright published the design in the Wasmuth Portfolio in 1910</span>

				<span class='text'>The contest was for the development of a suburban quarter section</span>
