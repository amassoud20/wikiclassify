				<span class='text'>Hugo Alvar Henrik Aalto 3 February 1898 – 11 May 1976 was a Finnish architect and designer as well as a sculptor and painter</span>
				<span class='text'>name Chilvers  His work includes architecture furniture  and </span>
				<span class='text'>Aaltos early career runs in parallel with the rapid economic growth and industrialization of Finland during the first half of the twentieth century and many of his clients were industrialists among these were the </span>
				<span class='text'>name Ahlström  The span of his career from the 1920s to the 1970s is lected in the styles of his work ranging from  of the early work to a rational  Modernism during the 1930s to a more organic modernist style from the 1940s onwards</span>
				<span class='text'>His furniture designs were considered </span>
				<span class='text'>name Boy  What is typical for his entire career however is a concern for design as a  a total work of art whereby he – together with his first wife  – would design not just the building but give special treatments to the interior surfaces and design furniture lamps and furnishings and glassware</span>
				<span class='text'>The Alvar Aalto Museum designed by Aalto himself is located in what is regarded as his home city </span>
				<span class='text'>BiographyHugo Alvar Henrik Aalto was born in  Finland</span>
				<span class='text'> His father Johan Henrik Aalto was a Finnish speaking land surveyor and his mother Selly Selma Matilda née Hackstedt was a Swedish speaking postmistress</span>
				<span class='text'>When Aalto was 5 years old the family moved to  and from there to  in </span>
				<span class='text'>Aalto studied at the Jyväskylä Lyceum school where he completed his basic education in 1916 and took drawing lessons from a local artist named </span>
				<span class='text'>In 1916 he then enrolled to study architecture at the </span>
				<span class='text'>His studies were interrupted by the  which he fought in</span>
				<span class='text'>He fought on the side of the  and fought at the  and the </span>
				<span class='text'> He built his first piece of architecture while still a student a house for his parents at </span>
				<span class='text'>name Labo1  Afterwards he continued his education graduating in 1921</span>
				<span class='text'>name EB  In the summer of 1922 he began his official military service finishing at the Hamina reserve officer training school and was promoted to reserve second lieutenant in June 1923</span>
				<span class='text'>name Heporauta 1999 10 In 1920 while still a student Aalto made his first trip abroad travelling via  to  where he even briefly found work with the architect </span>
				<span class='text'> In 1922 he accomplished his first independent piece at the Industrial Exposition in </span>
				<span class='text'>name Labo1  In 1923 he returned to  where he opened his first architectural office name   Brown  under the name Alvar Aalto Architect and Monumental Artist</span>
				<span class='text'>At that same time he also wrote articles for the Jyväskylä newspaper Sisä Suomi under the pseudonym Remus</span>
				<span class='text'>name Heporauta 1999 10  During this time he designed a number of small single family houses in Jyväskylä and the offices workload steadily increased</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1925 he married architect </span>
				<span class='text'>name SK  Their honeymoon journey to Italy was Aaltos first trip there though Aino had previously made a study trip there</span>
				<span class='text'>name SK  The latter trip together sealed an intellectual bond with the culture of the  region that was to remain important to Aalto for the rest of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>On their return they continued with a number of local projects notably the Jyväskylä Workers Club</span>
				<span class='text'>However the Aaltos moved their office to  in 1927 and started collaborating with architect </span>
				<span class='text'>The office moved again in 1933 to Helsinki</span>
				<span class='text'>name Brown  The Aaltos designed and built a  1935–36 for themselves in  Helsinki but later 1954–56 had a  erected in the same neighbourhood – nowadays the former is a house museum and the latter the premises of the Alvar Aalto Academy</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1926 the young Aaltos designed and had built a summer cottage in  </span>
				<span class='text'>In 1938 the Aaltos visited the United States for the first time name Brown  ostensibly to visit the Finnish Pavilion which they had designed for the  of the following year</span>
				<span class='text'> Aino Aalto died of cancer in 1949</span>
				<span class='text'>Aino and Alvar Aalto had 2 children a daughter Johanna Hanni Alanen born Aalto 1925 and a son Hamilkar Aalto 1928</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1952 Aalto married architect  died 1994 who had been working as an assistant in his office</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1952 Aalto designed and had built a summer cottage the  for himself and his new wife in  in Central Finland</span>
				<span class='text'>Alvar Aalto died on 11 May 1976 in  name EB  and is buried in the  in Helsinki</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he is sometimes regarded as among the first and most influential architects of Nordic  a closer examination of the historical facts reveals that Aalto while a pioneer in Finland closely followed and had personal contacts with other pioneers in Sweden in particular    and </span>
				<span class='text'>What they and many others of that generation in the Nordic countries had in common was that they started off from a classical education and were first designing classical architecture though what historians now call   – a style that had been a reaction to the previous dominant style of  – before moving in the late 1920s towards Modernism</span>
				<span class='text'>On returning to Jyväskylä in 1923 to establish his own architects office Aalto busied himself with a number of single family homes all designed in the Nordic Classicism style such as the manor like house for his mothers cousin Terho Manner in Töysa in 1923 a summer villa for the Jyväskylä chief constable in 1923 and the Alatalo farmhouse in Tarvaala in 1924</span>
				<span class='text'>During this period he also completed his first public buildings the Jyväskylä Workers Club in 1925 the Jyväskylä Defence Corps building in 1926 and the Seinäjoki Defence Corp building in 1924–29</span>
				<span class='text'>Aalto also entered several architectural competitions for prestigious state public buildings both in Finland and abroad including the two competitions for the Finnish Parliament building in 1923 and 1924 the extension to the  in 1931 and the building to house the  in Geneva Switzerland in 1926–27</span>
				<span class='text'>Furthermore this was the period when Aalto was most prolific in his writings with articles for professional journals and newspapers</span>
				<span class='text'>Among his most well known essays from this period are Urban culture 1924  Temple baths on Jyväskylä ridge 1925  Abbé Coignards sermon 1925  and From doorstep to living room 1926</span>
				<span class='text'> The shift in Aaltos design approach from classicism to modernism is epitomised by the  1927–35 which went through a transformation from an originally classical competition entry proposal to the completed high modernist building</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet his humanistic approach is in full evidence in the library the interior displays natural materials warm colours and undulating lines</span>
				<span class='text'>Due to problems over financing and a change of site the Viipuri Library project lasted eight years and during that same time he also designed the Turun Sanomat Building 1929–30 and Paimio Sanatorium 1929–32</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus the Turun Sanomat Building first heralded Aaltos move towards modernism and this was then carried forward both in the Paimio Sanatorium and in the ongoing design for the library</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the Turun Sanomat Building and Paimio Sanatorium are comparatively pure modernist works they too carried the seeds of his questioning of such an orthodox modernist approach and a move to a more daring synthetic attitude</span>
				<span class='text'>It has been said that his work on two of these three buildings not the Viipuri Library showed similarities to  style in particular his work on the  in </span>
				<span class='text'>name EB  His work on the Viipuri building started to show his individuality in a departure from the European norms</span>
				<span class='text'>hrough Sven Markelius Aalto became a member of the  CIAM attending the second congress in Frankfurt in 1929 and the fourth congress in Athens in 1933 where he established a close friendship with   and </span>
				<span class='text'>It was during this time that he followed closely the work of the main driving force behind the new modernism  and visited him in his Paris office several times in the following years</span>
				<span class='text'>t was not until the completion of the Paimio Sanatorium 1932 and Viipuri Library 1935 that Aalto first achieved world attention in architecture</span>
				<span class='text'>His reputation grew in the USA following the critical reception of his design for the Finnish Pavilion at the  described by  as a work of genius</span>
				<span class='text'> It could be said that Aaltos international reputation was sealed with his inclusion in the second edition of Sigfried Giedions influential book on Modernist architecture Space Time and Architecture The growth of a new tradition 1949 in which Aalto received more attention than any other Modernist architect including </span>
				<span class='text'>In his analysis of Aalto Giedion gave primacy to qualities that depart from direct functionality such as mood atmosphere intensity of life and even national characteristics declaring that Finland is with Aalto wherever he goes</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1938 the  in New York organized an exhibit that eventually went on a 12 city tour</span>
				<span class='text'>Afterwards he visited  for the first time and gave a series of lectures at </span>
				<span class='text'>name Labo1  During the 1930s Alvar spent some time experimenting with laminated wood making sculptures and abstract reliefs characterized by irregular curved forms</span>
				<span class='text'>Utilizing this knowledge he was able to solve technical problems concerning the flexibility of wood and also of working out spatial issues in his designs</span>
				<span class='text'>name Chilvers  Aaltos early experiments with wood and his move away from a purist modernism would be tested in built form with the commission to design Villa Mairea 1939 in  the luxury home of the young industrialist couple Harry and </span>
				<span class='text'>It was Maire Gullichsen who acted as the main client and she worked closely not only with Alvar but also Aino Aalto on the design inspiring them to be more daring in their work</span>
				<span class='text'>The original design was to include a private art gallery but this was never built</span>
				<span class='text'>The building forms a U shape around a central inner garden the central feature of which is a kidney shaped swimming pool</span>
				<span class='text'>Adjacent to the pool is a sauna executed in a rustic style alluding to both Finnish and Japanese precedents</span>
				<span class='text'>The design of the house is a synthesis of numerous stylistic influences from traditional Finnish vernacular to purist modernism as well as influences from English and Japanese architecture</span>
				<span class='text'>While the house is clearly intended for a wealthy family Aalto nevertheless argued that it was also an experiment that would prove useful in the design of mass housing</span>
				<span class='text'> It created zones for different activities within the structure</span>
				<span class='text'>name Brown His increased fame led to offers and commissions outside Finland</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1941 he accepted an invitation as a visiting professor to  in the USA</span>
				<span class='text'>This was during the  and he involved his students in designing low cost small scale housing for the reconstruction of war torn Finland</span>
				<span class='text'>While teaching at MIT Aalto also designed the student dormitory  completed in 1948</span>
				<span class='text'>The dormitory lay along the  and its undulating form provided maximum view and ventilation for each resident</span>
				<span class='text'>name Brown  This building was the first building of Aaltos redbrick period</span>
				<span class='text'>Originally used in Baker House to signify the Ivy League university tradition on his return to Finland Aalto used it in a number of key buildings in particular in several of the buildings in the new  campus starting in 1950  1952 Helsinki Pensions Institute 1954  1958 as well as in his own summer house the so called Experimental House in Muuratsalo 1957</span>
				<span class='text'>n the 50s he immersed himself in his sculpting be it with bronze marble or mixed media</span>
				<span class='text'>This paid off as he produced an outstanding piece for the memorial of the  1960 located on the battlefield</span>
				<span class='text'>It consists of a leaning bronze pillar on a pedestal</span>
				<span class='text'>name Chilvers  The early 1960s and 1970s up until his death in 1976 were marked by key works in Helsinki in particular the huge town plan for the void in centre of Helsinki adjacent to  Bay and the vast  and marked on the edges by significant buildings such as the National Museum and the main railway station both by </span>
				<span class='text'>In his town plan Aalto proposed a line of separate marble clad buildings fronting the bay which would house various cultural institutions including a concert hall opera museum of architecture and headquarters for the </span>
				<span class='text'>The scheme also extended into the  district with a series of tall office blocks</span>
				<span class='text'>Aalto first presented his scheme in 1961 but it went through various modifications during the early 1960s</span>
				<span class='text'>Only two fragments of the overall plan were ever realized the  concert hall 1976 fronting Töölö Bay and an office building in the Kamppi district for the Helsinki Electricity Company 1975</span>
				<span class='text'>The  formal language of geometric grids employed in the buildings was also used by Aalto for other sites in Helsinki including the  building 1962 the  1962 and the SYP Bank building 1969</span>
				<span class='text'>ollowing Aaltos death in 1976 his office continued to operate under the direction of his widow Elissa completing works already to some extent designed</span>
				<span class='text'>These works include the Jyväskylä City Theatre and </span>
				<span class='text'>Since the death of Elissa Aalto the office has continued to operate as the Alvar Aalto Academy giving advice on the restoration of Aalto buildings and organising the vast archive material</span>
				<span class='text'>urniture careerWhereas Aalto was famous for his architecture his furniture designs were well thought of and are still popular today</span>
				<span class='text'>He studied  and the  and for a period of time worked under </span>
				<span class='text'>name Boy  He also gained inspiration from </span>
				<span class='text'>name Boy  During the late 1920s and 1930s he working closely with Aino Aalto also focused a lot of his energy on furniture design partly due to the decision to design much of the individual furniture pieces and lamps for the Paimio Sanatorium</span>
				<span class='text'>Of particular significance was the experimentation in bent plywood chairs most notably the so called Paimio chair which had been designed for the sitting tuberculosis patient</span>
				<span class='text'>The Aaltos together with visual arts promoter Maire Gullichsen and art historian Nils Gustav Hahl founded the  company in 1935 name  Brown  ostensibly to sell Aalto products but also other imported products</span>
				<span class='text'> He became the first furniture designer to use the cantilever principle in chair design using wood</span>
				<span class='text'>name Boy AwardsAaltos awards included the  in 1954 the Royal Gold Medal for Architecture from the  in 1957 and the  from the  in 1963</span>
				<span class='text'>He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the  in 1957</span>
				<span class='text'>name AAAS  He also was a member of the  and was its president from 1963 to 1968</span>
				<span class='text'>From 1925 to 1956 he was a member of the </span>
				<span class='text'>name EB  In 1960 he received an honorary doctorate at the  NTNU</span>
				<span class='text'>WorksAaltos career spans the changes in style from  to purist  Modernism to a more personal synthetic and idiosyncratic Modernism</span>
				<span class='text'>Aaltos wide field of design activity ranges from the large scale of  and architecture to interior design furniture and  design and painting</span>
				<span class='text'>It has been estimated that during his entire career Aalto designed over 500 individual buildings approximately 300 of which were built the vast majority of which are in Finland</span>
				<span class='text'>He also has a few buildings in France Germany Italy and the USA</span>
				<span class='text'>name   GS Aaltos work with wood was influenced by early Scandinavian architects however his experiments and departure from the norm brought attention to his ability to make wood do things not previously done</span>
				<span class='text'>His techniques in the way he cut the  tree for example and also his ability to use plywood as structural and aesthetic</span>
				<span class='text'>Other examples include the rough hewn vertical placement of logs at his pavilion at the  expo looking similar to a medieval barricade at the orchestra platform at  and the Paris expo at the World Fair he used varying sizes and shapes of planks</span>
				<span class='text'>Also at Paris and at  he utilized birch boarding in a vertical arrangement</span>
				<span class='text'>Also his famous undulating walls and ceilings made of red pine</span>
				<span class='text'>name Labo2  In his roofing he created massive spans 155 foot at the covered statium at  all without tie rods</span>
				<span class='text'>His stairway at Villa Mairea he evokes feelings of a natural forest by binding beech wood with withes into columns</span>
				<span class='text'>name Labo3 Aalto claimed that his paintings were not made as individual artworks but as part of his process of architectural design and many of his small scale sculptural experiments with wood led to later larger architectural details and forms</span>
				<span class='text'>These experiments also led to a number of patents for example he invented a new form of laminated bent plywood furniture in 1932</span>
				<span class='text'>His experimental method had been influenced by his meetings with various members of the  design school especially  whom he first met in 1930</span>
				<span class='text'>Aaltos furniture was exhibited in London in 1935 to great critical acclaim and to cope with the consumer demand Aalto together with his wife Aino  and Nils Gustav Hahl founded the company  that same year</span>
				<span class='text'>Aalto glassware Aino as well as Alvar is manufactured by </span>

				<span class='text'>Finished in black lacquer the stools are used to seat customers at the Genius Bar and also in other areas of the store at times when seating is required for a product workshop or special event</span>

				<span class='text'>Alvar Aalto speech in London 1957</span>
				<span class='text'>ritique of Aaltos architectureAs already mentioned Aaltos international reputation was sealed with his inclusion in the second edition of Sigfried Giedions influential book on Modernist architecture Space Time and Architecture The growth of a new tradition 1949 in which Aalto received more attention than any other Modernist architect including </span>
				<span class='text'>In his analysis of Aalto Giedion gave primacy to qualities that depart from direct functionality such as mood atmosphere intensity of life and even national characteristics declaring that Finland is with Aalto wherever he goes</span>
				<span class='text'>However a few more recent architecture critics and historians have questioned Aaltos position of influence in the canonic history</span>
				<span class='text'>Italian Marxist architecture historians  and  put forward the viewpoint that Aaltos historical significance has perhaps been rather exaggerated with Aalto we are outside of the great themes that have made the course of contemporary architecture so dramatic</span>
				<span class='text'>The qualities of his works have a meaning only as masterful distractions not subject to reproduction outside the remote reality in which they have their roots</span>
				<span class='text'> Their viewpoint was propounded by their own priority given to urbanism seeing Aalto as an anti urban and thus consequently disparaging what they regarded as peripheral non urban areas of the world Essentially his architecture is not appropriate to urban typologies</span>
				<span class='text'>Similarly concerned with the appropriateness of Aaltos form language at the other end of the political spectrum American postmodernist critic  made a claim for the need for buildings to signify meaning however he then lifted out Aaltos Pensions Institute building as an example of what he termed Aaltos soft paternalism Conceived as a fragmented mass to break up the feeling of bureaucracy it succeeds all too well in being humane and killing the pensioner with kindness</span>
				<span class='text'>The forms are familiar red brick and ribbon strip windows broken by copper and bronze elements – all carried through with a literal mindedness that borders on the soporific</span>
				<span class='text'> But also during Aaltos lifetime he faced critique from his fellow architects in Finland most notably Kirmo Mikkola and  by the last decade of his life Aaltos work was seen as idiosyncratic and individualistic when the opposing tendencies of rationalism and constructivism – often championed under left wing politics – argued for anonymous virtually non aesthetic architecture</span>
				<span class='text'>Mikkola wrote of Aaltos late works Aalto has moved to his present baroque line</span>

				<span class='text'>MemorialsAalto has been commemorated in a number of ways Alvar Aalto is the  of the  now considered one of world architectures most prestigious awards</span>
				<span class='text'>Aalto was featured in the 50 mk note in the last series of the  before its replacement by the  in 2002</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1976 the year of his death Aalto was commemorated on a Finnish postage stamp</span>
