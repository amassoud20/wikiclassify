				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Chilvers&gt;{{harvnb|Chilvers|2004|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work includes architecture, furniture, [[textiles]] and [[glassware]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Aalto's early career runs in parallel with the rapid economic growth and industrialization of Finland during the first half of the twentieth century and many of his clients were industrialists; among these were the [[Ahlström-Gullichsen family]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ahlström&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The span of his career, from the 1920s to the 1970s, is reflected in the styles of his work, ranging from [[Nordic Classicism]] of the early work, to a rational [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]] Modernism during the 1930s to a more organic modernist style from the 1940s onwards</span>
				<span class='text'>His furniture designs were considered [[Scandinavian design|Scandinavian Modern]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Boy&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1985|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; What is typical for his entire career, however, is a concern for design as a [[Gesamtkunstwerk]], a ''total work of art''; whereby he – together with his first wife [[Aino Aalto]] – would design not just the building, but give special treatments to the interior surfaces and design furniture, lamps, and furnishings and glassware</span>
				<span class='text'>The Alvar Aalto Museum, designed by Aalto himself, is located in what is regarded as his home city [[Jyväskylä]]</span>

				<span class='text'>25, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;]]Hugo Alvar Henrik Aalto was born in [[Kuortane]], Finland</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thorne|1984|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Johan Henrik Aalto, was a Finnish-speaking land-surveyor and his mother, Selly (Selma) Matilda (née Hackstedt) was a Swedish-speaking postmistress</span>
				<span class='text'>When Aalto was 5 years old, the family moved to [[Alajärvi]], and from there to [[Jyväskylä]] in [[Central Finland]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Aalto studied at the Jyväskylä Lyceum school, where he completed his basic education in 1916 and took drawing lessons from a local artist named [[Jonas Heiska]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1916 he then enrolled to study architecture at the [[Helsinki University of Technology]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His studies were interrupted by the [[Finnish Civil War]], which he fought in</span>
				<span class='text'>He fought on the side of the ''[[White Guard (Finland)|White Army]]'' and fought at the [[Battle of Länkipohja]] and the [[Battle of Tampere]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pelkonen|2009|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He built his first piece of architecture while still a student, a house for his parents, at [[Alajärvi]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Labo1&gt;{{harvnb|Labò|1968|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, he continued his education, graduating in 1921</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|pp=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1922 he began his official military service, finishing at the Hamina reserve officer training school, and was promoted to reserve second lieutenant in June 1923</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Heporauta 1999 10&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Heporauta|1999|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;In 1920, while still a student, Aalto made his first trip abroad, travelling via [[Stockholm]] to [[Gothenburg]], where he even briefly found work with the architect [[Arvid Bjerke]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weston|1997|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, he accomplished his first independent piece at the Industrial Exposition in [[Tampere]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Labo1/&gt; In 1923 he returned to [[Jyväskylä]], where he opened his first architectural office,&lt;ref name = Brown/&gt; under the name 'Alvar Aalto, Architect and Monumental Artist'</span>
				<span class='text'>At that same time he also wrote articles for the Jyväskylä newspaper ''Sisä-Suomi'' under the pseudonym Remus</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Heporauta 1999 10&quot;/&gt; During this time, he designed a number of small single-family houses in Jyväskylä, and the office's workload steadily increased</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1925, he married architect [[Aino Aalto|Aino Marsio]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=SK/&gt;{{refn|group=nb|Some sources state that they were married in 1925</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=EB/&gt;}} Their honeymoon journey to Italy was Aalto's first trip there, though Aino had previously made a study trip there</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=SK&gt;{{harvnb|Suominen-Kokkonen|2007|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter trip together sealed an intellectual bond with the culture of the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] region that was to remain important to Aalto for the rest of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>On their return, they continued with a number of local projects, notably the Jyväskylä Worker's Club</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the Aaltos moved their office to [[Turku]] in 1927, and started collaborating with architect [[Erik Bryggman]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The office moved again in 1933 to Helsinki</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brown/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heporauta|1999|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;The Aaltos designed and built a [[Villa Aalto|joint house-office]] (1935–36) for themselves in [[Munkkiniemi]], Helsinki, but later (1954–56) had a [[Studio Aalto|purpose-built office]] erected in the same neighbourhood – nowadays the former is a &quot;house museum&quot; and the latter the premises of the Alvar Aalto Academy</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1926 the young Aaltos designed and had built a summer cottage in [[Alajärvi]], [[Villa Flora (Alvar Aalto building)|Villa Flora]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1938, the Aaltos visited the United States for the first time,&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt; ostensibly to visit the Finnish Pavilion, which they had designed, for the [[1939 New York World's Fair|New York World Fair]] of the following year</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heporauta|1999|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aino Aalto died of cancer in 1949</span>
				<span class='text'>Aino and Alvar Aalto had 2 children, a daughter Johanna &quot;Hanni&quot; Alanen, born Aalto, 1925, and a son Hamilkar Aalto, 1928</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1952 Aalto married architect [[Elissa Mäkiniemi]] (died 1994), who had been working as an assistant in his office</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1952 Aalto designed and had built a summer cottage, the [[Alvar Aalto Museum#The Muuratsalo Experiental House|so-called Experimental House]], for himself and his new wife in [[Muuratsalo]] in Central Finland</span>
				<span class='text'>Alvar Aalto died on 11 May 1976, in [[Helsinki]],&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; and is buried in the [[Hietaniemi cemetery]] in Helsinki</span>
				<span class='text'>==Architecture career=======Early career: classicism====Although he is sometimes regarded as among the first and most influential architects of Nordic [[modernism]], a closer examination of the historical facts reveals that Aalto (while a pioneer in Finland) closely followed and had personal contacts with other pioneers in Sweden, in particular [[Gunnar Asplund]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Paavilainen|1982|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aalto|1998|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sven Markelius]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{harvnb|Aalto|1998|p=76}} What they and many others of that generation in the Nordic countries had in common was that they started off from a classical education and were first designing classical architecture, though what historians now call [[Nordic Classicism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Paavilainen|1982|pp=11–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; – a style that had been a reaction to the previous dominant style of [[National romantic style|National Romanticism]] – before moving, in the late 1920s, towards Modernism</span>
				<span class='text'>On returning to Jyväskylä in 1923 to establish his own architect's office, Aalto busied himself with a number of single-family homes, all designed in the Nordic Classicism style, such as the manor-like house for his mother's cousin Terho Manner in Töysa in 1923, a summer villa for the Jyväskylä chief constable in 1923 and the Alatalo farmhouse in Tarvaala in 1924</span>
				<span class='text'>During this period he also completed his first public buildings, the Jyväskylä Workers' Club in 1925, the Jyväskylä Defence Corps building in 1926 and the Seinäjoki Defence Corp building in 1924–29</span>
				<span class='text'>Aalto also entered several architectural competitions for prestigious state public buildings, both in Finland and abroad, including the two competitions for the Finnish Parliament building in 1923 and 1924, the extension to the [[University of Helsinki]] in 1931, and the building to house the [[League of Nations]] in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1926–27</span>
				<span class='text'>Furthermore, this was the period when Aalto was most prolific in his writings, with articles for professional journals and newspapers</span>
				<span class='text'>Among his most well-known essays from this period are &quot;Urban culture&quot; (1924),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aalto|1998|pp=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Temple baths on Jyväskylä ridge&quot; (1925),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aalto|1998|pp=17–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Abbé Coignard's sermon&quot; (1925),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aalto|1998|pp=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;From doorstep to living room&quot; (1926)</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|The [[Aalto Theatre|Aalto-Theater]] opera house in [[Essen]], Germany]]====Early career: functionalism====The shift in Aalto's design approach from classicism to modernism is epitomised by the [[Vyborg Library|Viipuri Library]] (1927–35), which went through a transformation from an originally classical competition entry proposal to the completed high-modernist building</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet his humanistic approach is in full evidence in the library: the interior displays natural materials, warm colours, and undulating lines</span>
				<span class='text'>Due to problems over financing and a change of site, the Viipuri Library project lasted eight years, and during that same time he also designed the Turun Sanomat Building (1929–30){{refn | group = nb | The Turun Sanomat building heralded Aalto's entrance onto the international field as an architect</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brown/&gt;}} and Paimio Sanatorium (1929–32)</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, the Turun Sanomat Building first heralded Aalto's move towards modernism, and this was then carried forward both in the Paimio Sanatorium and in the ongoing design for the library</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the Turun Sanomat Building and Paimio Sanatorium are comparatively pure modernist works, they too carried the seeds of his questioning of such an orthodox modernist approach and a move to a more daring, synthetic attitude</span>
				<span class='text'>It has been said that his work on two of these three buildings (not the Viipuri Library) showed similarities to [[Walter Gropius]]' style, in particular his work on the [[Bauhaus school#Dessau|Bauhaus school of design]] in [[Dessau]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=EB/&gt; His work on the Viipuri building started to show his individuality in a departure from the European norms</span>
				<span class='text'>hrough Sven Markelius, Aalto became a member of the [[Congres Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne]] (CIAM), attending the second congress in Frankfurt in 1929 and the fourth congress in Athens in 1933, where he established a close friendship with [[László Moholy-Nagy]], [[Sigfried Giedion]] and [[Philip Morton Shand]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It was during this time that he followed closely the work of the main driving force behind the new modernism, [[Le Corbusier]], and visited him in his Paris office several times in the following years</span>
				<span class='text'>t was not until the completion of the Paimio Sanatorium (1932) and Viipuri Library (1935) that Aalto first achieved world attention in architecture</span>
				<span class='text'>His reputation grew in the USA following the critical reception of his design for the Finnish Pavilion at the [[1939 New York World's Fair]], described by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] as a &quot;work of genius&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McCarter|2006|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; It could be said that Aalto's international reputation was sealed with his inclusion in the second edition of Sigfried Giedion's influential book on Modernist architecture, ''Space, Time and Architecture: The growth of a new tradition'' (1949), in which Aalto received more attention than any other Modernist architect, including [[Le Corbusier]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In his analysis of Aalto, Giedion gave primacy to qualities that depart from direct functionality, such as mood, atmosphere, intensity of life and even national characteristics, declaring that &quot;Finland is with Aalto wherever he goes&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1938, the [[Museum of Modern Art]], in New York organized an exhibit that eventually went on a 12-city tour</span>
				<span class='text'>Afterwards he visited [[United States|America]] for the first time and gave a series of lectures at [[Yale]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Labo1/&gt;====Mid career: experimentation====During the 1930s Alvar spent some time experimenting with laminated wood, making sculptures, and abstract reliefs, characterized by irregular curved forms</span>
				<span class='text'>Utilizing this knowledge he was able to solve technical problems concerning the flexibility of wood and also of working out spatial issues in his designs</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Chilvers/&gt; Aalto's early experiments with wood and his move away from a purist modernism would be tested in built form with the commission to design Villa Mairea (1939) in [[Noormarkku]], the luxury home of the young industrialist couple Harry and [[Maire Gullichsen]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It was Maire Gullichsen who acted as the main client, and she worked closely not only with Alvar but also Aino Aalto on the design, inspiring them to be more daring in their work</span>
				<span class='text'>The original design was to include a private art gallery, but this was never built</span>
				<span class='text'>The building forms a U-shape around a central inner &quot;garden&quot; the central feature of which is a kidney-shaped swimming pool</span>
				<span class='text'>Adjacent to the pool is a sauna executed in a rustic style, alluding to both Finnish and Japanese precedents</span>
				<span class='text'>The design of the house is a synthesis of numerous stylistic influences, from traditional Finnish vernacular to purist modernism, as well as influences from English and Japanese architecture</span>
				<span class='text'>While the house is clearly intended for a wealthy family, Aalto nevertheless argued that it was also an experiment that would prove useful in the design of mass housing</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pallasmaa|1998|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; It created zones for different activities within the structure</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|1969|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;His increased fame led to offers and commissions outside Finland</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1941 he accepted an invitation as a visiting professor to [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in the USA</span>
				<span class='text'>This was during the [[Second World War]], and he involved his students in designing low-cost, small-scale housing for the reconstruction of war-torn Finland</span>
				<span class='text'>While teaching at MIT, Aalto also designed the student dormitory, [[List of MIT undergraduate dormitories#Baker House|Baker House]], completed in 1948</span>
				<span class='text'>The dormitory lay along the [[Charles River]] and its undulating form provided maximum view and ventilation for each resident</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brown/&gt; This building was the first building of Aalto's redbrick period</span>
				<span class='text'>Originally used in Baker House to signify the Ivy League university tradition, on his return to Finland Aalto used it in a number of key buildings, in particular, in several of the buildings in the new [[Helsinki University of Technology]] campus (starting in 1950), [[Säynätsalo Town Hall]] (1952), Helsinki Pensions Institute (1954), [[Kulttuuritalo|Helsinki House of Culture]] (1958), as well as in his own summer house, the so-called Experimental House in Muuratsalo (1957)</span>
				<span class='text'>n the 50's he immersed himself in his sculpting, be it with bronze, marble, or mixed media</span>
				<span class='text'>This paid off as he produced an outstanding piece for the memorial of the [[Battle of Suomussalmi]] (1960), located on the battlefield</span>
				<span class='text'>It consists of a leaning bronze pillar on a pedestal</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Chilvers/&gt;====Mature career: monumentalism====The early 1960s and 1970s (up until his death in 1976) were marked by key works in Helsinki, in particular the huge town plan for the void in centre of Helsinki adjacent to [[Töölö]] Bay and the vast [[VR warehouses|railway yards]], and marked on the edges by significant buildings such as the National Museum and the main railway station, both by [[Eliel Saarinen]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In his town plan Aalto proposed a line of separate marble-clad buildings fronting the bay which would house various cultural institutions, including a concert hall, opera, museum of architecture and headquarters for the [[Finnish Academy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The scheme also extended into the [[Kamppi]] district with a series of tall office blocks</span>
				<span class='text'>Aalto first presented his scheme in 1961, but it went through various modifications during the early 1960s</span>
				<span class='text'>Only two fragments of the overall plan were ever realized: the [[Finlandia Hall]] concert hall (1976) fronting Töölö Bay, and an office building in the Kamppi district for the Helsinki Electricity Company (1975)</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe|Miesian]] formal language of geometric grids employed in the buildings was also used by Aalto for other sites in Helsinki, including the [[Stora Enso|Enso-Gutzeit]] building (1962), the [[Stockmann|Academic Bookstore]] (1962) and the SYP Bank building (1969)</span>
				<span class='text'>ollowing Aalto's death in 1976 his office continued to operate under the direction of his widow, Elissa, completing works already to some extent designed</span>
				<span class='text'>These works include the Jyväskylä City Theatre and [[Aalto Theatre|Essen opera house]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Since the death of Elissa Aalto the office has continued to operate as the Alvar Aalto Academy, giving advice on the restoration of Aalto buildings and organising the vast archive material</span>
				<span class='text'>=Furniture career==Whereas Aalto was famous for his architecture, his furniture designs were well thought of and are still popular today</span>
				<span class='text'>He studied [[Josef Hoffmann]] and the [[Wiener Werkstätte]], and for a period of time, worked under [[Eliel Saarinen]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Boy/&gt; He also gained inspiration from [[Gebrüder Thonet]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Boy/&gt; During the late 1920s and 1930s he, working closely with Aino Aalto, also focused a lot of his energy on furniture design, partly due to the decision to design much of the individual furniture pieces and lamps for the Paimio Sanatorium</span>
				<span class='text'>Of particular significance was the experimentation in bent plywood chairs, most notably the so-called Paimio chair, which had been designed for the sitting tuberculosis patient</span>
				<span class='text'>The Aaltos, together with visual arts promoter Maire Gullichsen and art historian Nils-Gustav Hahl founded the [[Artek (company)|Artek]] company in 1935,&lt;ref name= Brown/&gt; ostensibly to sell Aalto products, but also other imported products</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pallasmaa|1998|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became the first furniture designer to use the cantilever principle in chair design using wood</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Boy/&gt;==Awards==Aalto's awards included the [[Prince Eugen Medal]] in 1954, the Royal Gold Medal for Architecture from the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] in 1957 and the [[AIA Gold Medal|Gold Medal]] from the [[American Institute of Architects]] in 1963</span>
				<span class='text'>He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1957</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{harvnb|Tourney|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also was a member of the [[Academy of Finland]], and was its president from 1963 to 1968</span>
				<span class='text'>From 1925 to 1956 he was a member of the [[Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=EB/&gt; In 1960 he received an honorary doctorate at the [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]] (NTNU)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;==Works==Aalto's career spans the changes in style from ([[Nordic Classicism]]) to purist [[International style (architecture)|International Style]] Modernism to a more personal, synthetic and idiosyncratic Modernism</span>
				<span class='text'>Aalto's wide field of design activity ranges from the large scale of [[city planning]] and architecture to interior design, furniture and [[glassware]] design and painting</span>
				<span class='text'>It has been estimated that during his entire career Aalto designed over 500 individual buildings, approximately 300 of which were built, the vast majority of which are in Finland</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = GS&gt;{{harvnb|Schildt|1994|pp=310–313}}&lt;/ref&gt;Aalto's work with wood, was influenced by early Scandinavian architects; however, his experiments and departure from the norm brought attention to his ability to make wood do things not previously done</span>
				<span class='text'>His techniques in the way he cut the [[beech]] tree, for example, and also his ability to use plywood as structural and aesthetic</span>
				<span class='text'>Other examples include the rough-hewn vertical placement of logs at his pavilion at the [[Lapua]] expo, looking similar to a medieval barricade, at the orchestra platform at [[turku]] and the Paris expo at the World Fair, he used varying sizes and shapes of planks</span>
				<span class='text'>Also at Paris and at [[Villa Mairea]] he utilized birch boarding in a vertical arrangement</span>
				<span class='text'>Also his famous undulating walls and ceilings made of red pine</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Labo2&gt;{{harvnb|Labò|1968|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his roofing, he created massive spans (155-foot at the covered statium at [[Otaniemi]]) all without tie rods</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Labo3&gt;{{harvnb|Labò|1968|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;Aalto claimed that his paintings were not made as individual artworks but as part of his process of architectural design, and many of his small-scale &quot;sculptural&quot; experiments with wood led to later larger architectural details and forms</span>
				<span class='text'>These experiments also led to a number of patents: for example, he invented a new form of laminated bent-plywood furniture in 1932</span>
				<span class='text'>{refn |group =nb|The patent is dated 1933</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Chilvers/&gt;}} His experimental method had been influenced by his meetings with various members of the [[Bauhaus]] design school, especially [[László Moholy-Nagy]], whom he first met in 1930</span>
				<span class='text'>Aalto's furniture was exhibited in London in 1935, to great critical acclaim, and to cope with the consumer demand Aalto, together with his wife Aino, [[Maire Gullichsen]] and Nils-Gustav Hahl founded the company [[Artek (company)|Artek]] that same year</span>
				<span class='text'>Aalto glassware (Aino as well as Alvar) is manufactured by [[Iittala]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Aalto was one of the first architects outside of Germany, France, and the [[Netherlands]] to master modern architecture</span>

				<span class='text'>Finished in black lacquer, the stools are used to seat customers at the 'Genius Bar' and also in other areas of the store at times when seating is required for a product workshop or special event</span>
				<span class='text'>Aalto was also influential in bringing [[modern art]] to the Finnish people, in particular the work of his friends, [[Alexander Milne Calder]] and [[Fernand Léger]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Everything else is at least for me an abuse of paper</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Alvar Aalto, ''Sketches'', 1978, 104</span>
				<span class='text'> &quot;We should work for simple, good, undecorated things&quot; and he continues, &quot;but things which are in harmony with the human being and organically suited to the little man in the street</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Alvar Aalto, speech in London 1957</span>
				<span class='text'>=Critique of Aalto's architecture==As already mentioned, Aalto's international reputation was sealed with his inclusion in the second edition of Sigfried Giedion's influential book on Modernist architecture, ''Space, Time and Architecture: The growth of a new tradition'' (1949), in which Aalto received more attention than any other Modernist architect, including [[Le Corbusier]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In his analysis of Aalto, Giedion gave primacy to qualities that depart from direct functionality, such as mood, atmosphere, intensity of life and even national characteristics, declaring that &quot;Finland is with Aalto wherever he goes&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>However, a few more recent architecture critics and historians have questioned Aalto's position of influence in the canonic history</span>
				<span class='text'>Italian Marxist architecture historians [[Manfredo Tafuri]] and [[Francesco Dal Co]] put forward the viewpoint that Aalto's &quot;historical significance has perhaps been rather exaggerated; with Aalto we are outside of the great themes that have made the course of contemporary architecture so dramatic</span>
				<span class='text'>The qualities of his works have a meaning only as masterful distractions, not subject to reproduction outside the remote reality in which they have their roots</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tafuri|Co|1976|p=338}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their viewpoint was propounded by their own priority given to urbanism, seeing Aalto as an anti-urban, and thus consequently disparaging what they regarded as peripheral non-urban areas of the world: &quot;Essentially his architecture is not appropriate to urban typologies</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Similarly concerned with the appropriateness of Aalto's form language, at the other end of the political spectrum, American postmodernist critic [[Charles Jencks]] made a claim for the need for buildings to signify meaning; however, he then lifted out Aalto's Pensions Institute building as an example of what he termed Aalto's 'soft paternalism': &quot;Conceived as a fragmented mass to break up the feeling of bureaucracy, it succeeds all too well in being humane and killing the pensioner with kindness</span>
				<span class='text'>The forms are familiar red brick and ribbon-strip windows broken by copper and bronze elements – all carried through with a literal-mindedness that borders on the soporific</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jencks|1973|pp=80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; But also during Aalto's lifetime he faced critique from his fellow architects in Finland, most notably Kirmo Mikkola and [[Juhani Pallasmaa]]; by the last decade of his life Aalto's work was seen as idiosyncratic and individualistic, when the opposing tendencies of rationalism and constructivism – often championed under left-wing politics – argued for anonymous virtually non-aesthetic architecture</span>
				<span class='text'>Mikkola wrote of Aalto's late works: &quot;Aalto has moved to his present baroque line</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mikkola|1969|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;==Memorials==Aalto has been commemorated in a number of ways:* Alvar Aalto is the [[eponym]] of the [[Alvar Aalto Medal]], now considered one of world architecture's most prestigious awards</span>
				<span class='text'> Aalto was featured in the 50 mk note in the last series of the [[Finnish markka]] (before its replacement by the [[Euro]] in 2002)</span>
				<span class='text'> The centenary of Aalto's birth in 1898 was marked in Finland not only by several books and exhibitions, but also by the promotion of specially bottled red and white Aalto Wine and a specially designed [[cupcake]]</span>
				<span class='text'> In 1976, the year of his death, Aalto was commemorated on a Finnish postage stamp</span>
				<span class='text'> [[Aalto University]], a Finnish university formed by merging [[Helsinki University of Technology]], [[Helsinki School of Economics]] and [[University of Art and Design Helsinki|TaiK]] in 2010, is named after Alvar Aalto</span>
				<span class='text'> An Alvar Aallon katu (Alvar Aalto Street) can be found in five different Finnish cities: Helsinki, Jyväskylä, Oulu, Kotka and Seinäjoki</span>
