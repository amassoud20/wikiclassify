				<span class='text'>He is known for three major works of [[Latin literature]], the ''[[Eclogues]]'' (or ''Bucolics''), the ''[[Georgics]]'', and the [[Epic poetry|epic]] ''[[Aeneid]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>A number of minor poems, collected in the ''[[Appendix Vergiliana]]'', are sometimes attributed to him</span>
				<span class='text'>irgil is traditionally ranked as one of Rome's greatest poets</span>
				<span class='text'>His ''Aeneid'' has been considered the [[national epic]] of ancient Rome from the time of its composition to the present day</span>
				<span class='text'>Modeled after [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'', the ''Aeneid'' follows the [[Trojan War|Trojan refugee]] [[Aeneas]] as he struggles to fulfill his destiny and arrive on the shores of Italy‚Äîin [[Roman mythology]] the founding act of Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>Virgil's work has had wide and deep influence on [[Western literature]], most notably [[Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', in which Virgil appears as Dante's guide through hell and purgatory</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|220px|right|A [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of Virgil in [[Naples]]]]Virgil's biographical tradition is thought to depend on a lost biography by [[Lucius Varius Rufus|Varius]], Virgil's editor, which was incorporated into the biography by [[Suetonius]] and the commentaries of [[Servius]] and [[Aelius Donatus|Donatus]], the two great commentators on Virgil's poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the commentaries no doubt record much factual information about Virgil, some of their evidence can be shown to rely on inferences made from his poetry and allegorizing; thus, Virgil's biographical tradition remains problematic</span>

				<span class='text'>602&lt;/ref&gt;The tradition holds that Virgil was born in the village of [[Virgilio, Lombardy|Andes]], near [[Mantua]]&lt;ref&gt;The epitaph on his tomb in Posilipo near Naples was ''Mantua me genuit; Calabri rapuere; tenet nunc Parthenope</span>

				<span class='text'>pg Map of Cisalpine Gaul]&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of his name has led to beliefs that he descended from earlier Roman colonists</span>
				<span class='text'>Modern speculation ultimately is not supported by narrative evidence either from his own writings or his later biographers</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Macrobius]] says that Virgil's father was of a humble background; however, scholars generally believe that Virgil was from an [[Roman aristocracy#The ordo equester under Augustus|equestrian]] landowning family which could afford to give him an education</span>
				<span class='text'>He attended schools in [[Cremona]], [[Mediolanum]], [[Rome]] and [[Naples]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After considering briefly a career in [[rhetoric]] and law, the young Virgil turned his talents to poetry</span>

				<span class='text'>du/markdamen/1320AncLit/chapters/11verg</span>
				<span class='text'>tm&lt;/ref&gt;===Early works==={{Main| Appendix Vergiliana}}According to the commentators, Virgil received his first education when he was five years old and he later went to [[Cremona]], [[Milan]], and finally [[Rome]] to study [[rhetoric]], [[medicine]], and [[astronomy]], which he soon abandoned for [[philosophy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>From Virgil's admiring references to the [[neoteric]] writers [[Gaius Asinius Pollio (consul 40 BC)|Pollio]] and [[Helvius Cinna|Cinna]], it has been inferred that he was, for a time, associated with [[Catullus]]' neoteric circle</span>
				<span class='text'>However schoolmates considered Virgil extremely shy and reserved, according to Servius, and he was nicknamed &quot;Parthenias&quot; or &quot;maiden&quot; because of his social aloofness</span>
				<span class='text'>Virgil seems to have suffered bad health throughout his life and in some ways lived the life of an invalid</span>
				<span class='text'>According to the ''[[Appendix Vergiliana#Catalepton (&quot;Trifles&quot;)|Catalepton]]'', while in the [[Epicurean]] school of [[Siro the Epicurean]] at Naples, he began to write poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>A group of small works attributed to the youthful Virgil by the commentators survive collected under the title ''[[Appendix Vergiliana]]'', but are largely considered spurious by scholars</span>
				<span class='text'>One, the ''Catalepton'', consists of fourteen short poems,&lt;ref name=&quot;Fowler, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>602&quot;&gt;Fowler, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>602&lt;/ref&gt; some of which may be Virgil's, and another, a short narrative poem titled the ''[[Appendix Vergiliana#Culex (&quot;The Gnat&quot;)|Culex]]'' (&quot;The Gnat&quot;), was attributed to Virgil as early as the 1st century AD</span>
				<span class='text'>==The ''Eclogues''==={{Main| Eclogues}}[[File:RomanVirgilFolio001rEclogues</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Page from the beginning of the ''Eclogues'' in the 5th-century ''Vergilius Romanus'']]The biographical tradition asserts that Virgil began the hexameter ''[[Eclogues]]'' (or ''Bucolics'') in 42 BC and it is thought that the collection was published around 39‚Äì38 BC, although this is controversial</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Fowler, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>602&quot;/&gt; The ''Eclogues'' (from the Greek for &quot;selections&quot;) are a group of ten poems roughly modeled on the bucolic hexameter poetry (&quot;pastoral poetry&quot;) of the Hellenistic poet [[Theocritus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After his victory in the [[Battle of Philippi]] in 42 BC, fought against the army led by the assassins of [[Julius Caesar]], [[Octavian]] tried to pay off his veterans with land expropriated from towns in northern [[Italy (Roman Empire)|Italy]], supposedly including, according to the tradition, an estate near Mantua belonging to Virgil</span>
				<span class='text'>The loss of his family farm and the attempt through poetic petitions to regain his property have traditionally been seen as Virgil's motives in the composition of the ''Eclogues''</span>
				<span class='text'>This is now thought to be an unsupported inference from interpretations of the ''Eclogues''</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''Eclogues'' 1 and 9, Virgil indeed dramatizes the contrasting feelings caused by the brutality of the land expropriations through pastoral idiom, but offers no indisputable evidence of the supposed biographic incident</span>
				<span class='text'>While some readers have identified the poet himself with various characters and their vicissitudes, whether gratitude by an old rustic to a new god (''Ecl''</span>
				<span class='text'>1), frustrated love by a rustic singer for a distant boy (his master's pet, ''Ecl''</span>
				<span class='text'>2), or a master singer's claim to have composed several eclogues (''Ecl''</span>
				<span class='text'>5), modern scholars largely reject such efforts to garner biographical details from works of fiction, preferring to interpret an author's characters and themes as illustrations of contemporary life and thought</span>
				<span class='text'>he ten ''Eclogues'' present traditional pastoral themes with a fresh perspective</span>
				<span class='text'>Eclogues 1 and 9 address the land confiscations and their effects on the Italian countryside</span>
				<span class='text'>2 and 3 are pastoral and erotic, discussing both homosexual love (''Ecl''</span>
				<span class='text'>2) and attraction toward people of any gender (''Ecl''</span>
				<span class='text'>3)</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Eclogue 4|''Eclogue'' 4]], addressed to [[Asinius Pollio]], the so-called &quot;Messianic Eclogue&quot; uses the imagery of the golden age in connection with the birth of a child (who the child was meant to be has been subject to debate)</span>
				<span class='text'>5 and 8 describe the myth of [[Daphnis]] in a song contest, 6, the cosmic and mythological song of [[Silenus]]; 7, a heated poetic contest, and 10 the sufferings of the contemporary elegiac poet [[Cornelius Gallus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Virgil is credited{{by whom|date=August 2011}} in the ''Eclogues'' with establishing [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadia]] as a poetic ideal that still resonates in Western literature and visual arts and setting the stage for the development of Latin pastoral by [[Calpurnius Siculus]], [[Nemesianus]], and later writers</span>

				<span class='text'>603&quot;&gt;Fowler , pg</span>
				<span class='text'>603&lt;/ref&gt; Virgil became part of the circle of [[Maecenas]], Octavian's capable ''agent d'affaires'' who sought to counter sympathy for Antony among the leading families by rallying Roman literary figures to Octavian's side</span>
				<span class='text'>Virgil came to know many of the other leading literary figures of the time, including [[Horace]], in whose poetry he is often mentioned,&lt;ref&gt;Horace, ''Satires'' 1</span>
				<span class='text'>, 1</span>
				<span class='text'>, and Odes 1</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Varius Rufus]], who later helped finish the ''Aeneid''</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|400px|Late 17th-century illustration of a passage from the ''Georgics'' by [[Jerzy Siemiginowski-Eleuter]]]]At Maecenas' insistence (according to the tradition) Virgil spent the ensuing years (perhaps 37‚Äì29 BC) on the long didactic hexameter poem called the ''[[Georgics]]'' (from Greek, &quot;On Working the Earth&quot;) which he dedicated to Maecenas</span>
				<span class='text'>The ostensible theme of the ''Georgics'' is instruction in the methods of running a farm</span>
				<span class='text'>In handling this theme, Virgil follows in the [[didactic]] (&quot;how to&quot;) tradition of the Greek poet [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Works and Days]]'' and several works of the later Hellenistic poets</span>
				<span class='text'>The four books of the ''Georgics'' focus respectively on raising crops and trees (1 and 2), livestock and horses (3), and beekeeping and the qualities of bees (4)</span>
				<span class='text'>Well-known passages include the beloved ''Laus Italiae'' of Book 2, the prologue description of the temple in Book 3, and the description of the plague at the end of Book 3</span>
				<span class='text'>Book 4 concludes with a long mythological narrative, in the form of an ''[[epyllion]]'' which describes vividly the discovery of beekeeping by [[Aristaeus]] and the story of [[Orpheus]]' journey to the underworld</span>
				<span class='text'>Ancient scholars, such as Servius, conjectured that the Aristaeus episode replaced, at the emperor's request, a long section in praise of Virgil's friend, the poet Gallus, who was disgraced by Augustus, and who committed suicide in 26 BC</span>
				<span class='text'>he ''Georgics''' tone wavers between optimism and pessimism, sparking critical debate on the poet's intentions,&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>605&lt;/ref&gt; but the work lays the foundations for later didactic poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>Virgil and Maecenas are said to have taken turns reading the ''Georgics'' to Octavian upon his return from defeating Antony and [[Cleopatra]] at the [[Battle of Actium]] in 31 BC</span>

				<span class='text'>603&quot;/&gt; Homer, the preeminent author of classical epic, is everywhere present, but Virgil also makes special use of the Latin poet [[Ennius]] and the Hellenistic poet [[Apollonius of Rhodes]] among the various other writers to which he alludes</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the ''Aeneid'' casts itself firmly into the epic mode, it often seeks to expand the genre by including elements of other genres such as tragedy and aetiological poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>Ancient commentators noted that Virgil seems to divide the ''Aeneid'' into two sections based on the poetry of Homer; the first six books were viewed as employing the ''Odyssey'' as a model while the last six were connected to the ''Iliad''</span>

				<span class='text'>The queen, [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido]], welcomes the ancestor of the Romans, and under the influence of the gods falls deeply in love with him</span>
				<span class='text'>At a banquet in Book 2, Aeneas tells the story of the sack of Troy, the death of his wife, and his escape, to the enthralled Carthaginians, while in Book 3 he recounts to them his wanderings over the Mediterranean in search of a suitable new home</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]] in Book 4 recalls the lingering Aeneas to his duty to found a new city, and he slips away from Carthage, leaving Dido to commit [[suicide]], cursing Aeneas and calling down revenge in a symbolic anticipation of the fierce wars between Carthage and Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>In Book 5, Aeneas' father [[Anchises]] dies and funeral games are celebrated for him</span>
				<span class='text'>On reaching [[Cumae]], in Italy in Book 6, Aeneas consults the [[Cumaean Sibyl]], who conducts him through the [[Underworld]] where Aeneas meets the dead Anchises who reveals Rome's destiny to his son</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|280px|''Virgil Reading the'' Aeneid to ''Augustus, Octavia, and Livia'' by [[Jean-Baptiste Wicar]], Art Institute of Chicago]]Critics of the ''Aeneid'' focus on a variety of issues</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;For a bibliography and summary see Fowler, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>605‚Äì6&lt;/ref&gt; The tone of the poem as a whole is a particular matter of debate; some see the poem as ultimately pessimistic and politically subversive to the Augustan regime, while others view it as a celebration of the new imperial dynasty</span>
				<span class='text'>Virgil makes use of the symbolism of the Augustan regime, and some scholars see strong associations between Augustus and Aeneas, the one as founder and the other as re-founder of Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>A strong [[teleology]], or drive towards a climax, has been detected in the poem</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''Aeneid'' is full of prophecies about the future of Rome, the deeds of Augustus, his ancestors, and famous Romans, and the [[Carthaginian Wars]]; the shield of Aeneas even depicts Augustus' victory at [[Battle of Actium|Actium]] against [[Mark Antony]] and [[Cleopatra VII]] in 31 BC</span>
				<span class='text'>A further focus of study is the character of Aeneas</span>
				<span class='text'>As the protagonist of the poem, Aeneas seems to waver constantly between his emotions and commitment to his prophetic duty to found Rome; critics note the breakdown of Aeneas' emotional control in the last sections of the poem where the &quot;pious&quot; and &quot;righteous&quot; Aeneas mercilessly slaughters Turnus</span>
				<span class='text'>he ''Aeneid'' appears to have been a great success</span>
				<span class='text'>Virgil is said to have recited Books 2, 4, and 6 to Augustus;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fowler , pg</span>
				<span class='text'>603&quot;/&gt; and Book 6 apparently caused Augustus' sister [[Octavia the Younger|Octavia]] to faint</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the truth of this claim is subject to scholarly scepticism, it has served as a basis for later art, such as [[Jean-Baptiste Wicar]]'s ''Virgil Reading the Aeneid''</span>
				<span class='text'>nfortunately, some lines of the poem were left unfinished, and the whole was unedited, at Virgil's death in 19 BC</span>
				<span class='text'>==Virgil's death and editing of the ''Aeneid''===According to the tradition, Virgil traveled to [[Greece]] in about 19 BC to revise the ''Aeneid''</span>
				<span class='text'>After meeting Augustus in Athens and deciding to return home, Virgil caught a fever while visiting a town near [[Megara]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After crossing to Italy by ship, weakened with disease, Virgil died in [[Brundisium]] harbor on September 21, 19 BC</span>
				<span class='text'>Augustus ordered Virgil's literary executors, [[Lucius Varius Rufus]] and [[Plotius Tucca]], to disregard Virgil's own wish [[Book burning#Book burning wills|that the poem be burned]], instead ordering it published with as few editorial changes as possible</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|250px|A 3rd-century Tunisian mosaic of Virgil seated between [[Clio]] and [[Melpomene]] (from [[Hadrumetum]] [Sousse])]]The works of Virgil almost from the moment of their publication revolutionized Latin poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''Eclogues'', ''Georgics'', and above all the ''Aeneid'' became standard texts in school curricula with which all educated Romans were familiar</span>
				<span class='text'>Poets following Virgil often refer intertextually to his works to generate meaning in their own poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>The Augustan poet [[Ovid]] parodies the opening lines of the ''Aeneid'' in ''[[Amores (Ovid)|Amores]]'' 1</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>‚Äì2, and his summary of the Aeneas story in Book 14 of the ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', the so-called &quot;mini-Aeneid&quot;, has been viewed as a particularly important example of post-Virgilian response to the epic genre</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Lucan]]'s epic, the ''[[Pharsalia|Bellum Civile]]'' has been considered an anti-Virgilian epic, disposing with the divine mechanism, treating historical events, and diverging drastically from Virgilian epic practice</span>
				<span class='text'>The Flavian poet [[Statius]] in his 12-book epic ''Thebaid'' engages closely with the poetry of Virgil; in his epilogue he advises his poem not to &quot;rival the divine ''Aeneid'', but follow afar and ever venerate its footsteps</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|A 5th-century portrait of Virgil from the [[Vergilius Romanus]]]]Even as the Western Roman empire collapsed, literate men acknowledged that Virgil was a master poet</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Gregory of Tours]] read Virgil, whom he quotes in several places, along with some other Latin poets, though he cautions that &quot;we ought not to relate their lying fables, lest we fall under sentence of eternal death</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;[[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] made Virgil his guide in [[Hell]] and the greater part of [[Purgatory]] in ''[[Divine Comedy|The Divine Comedy]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Dante also mentions Virgil in ''[[De vulgari eloquentia]]'', along with [[Ovid]], [[Marcus Annaeus Lucanus|Lucan]] and [[Statius]], as one of the four ''regulati poetae'' (ii, vi, 7)</span>
				<span class='text'>he best-known surviving manuscripts of Virgil's works include the ''[[Vergilius Augusteus]],'' the ''[[Vergilius Vaticanus]]'' and the ''[[Vergilius Romanus]]</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|''Virgil in his Basket'', [[Lucas van Leyden]], 1525]]In the Middle Ages, Virgil's reputation was such that it inspired legends associating him with magic and prophecy</span>

				<span class='text'>As such, Virgil came to be seen on a similar level as the [[Bible prophecy|Hebrew prophets of the Bible]] as one who had heralded Christianity</span>

				<span class='text'>In what became known as the ''[[Sortes Vergilianae]]'' (Virgilian Lots), passages would be selected at random and interpreted to answer questions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ziolkowski &amp; Putnam, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>xxxiv, 829‚Äì830</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In the 12th century, starting around [[Naples]] but eventually spreading widely throughout Europe, a tradition developed in which Virgil was regarded as a great [[Magician (paranormal)|magician]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Legends about Virgil and his magical powers remained popular for over two hundred years, arguably becoming as prominent as his writings themselves</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ziolkowski &amp; Putnam, p</span>
				<span class='text'>xxxiv</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Virgil's legacy in medieval [[Wales]] was such that the Welsh version of his name, ''Fferyllt'' or ''Pheryllt'', became a generic term for magic-worker, and survives in the modern Welsh word for [[pharmacist]], ''fferyllydd''</span>

				<span class='text'>101‚Äì102</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The legend of '''Virgil in his Basket''' arose in the Middle Ages, and is often seen in art and mentioned in literature as part of the [[Power of Women]] [[literary topos]], demonstrating the disruptive force of female attractiveness on men</span>
				<span class='text'>In this story Virgil became enamoured of a beautiful woman, sometimes described as the emperor's daughter or mistress and called Lucretia</span>
				<span class='text'> She played him along and agreed to an assignation at her house, which he was to sneak into at night by climbing into a large basket let down from a window</span>
				<span class='text'> When he did so he was only hoisted halfway up the wall and then left him trapped there into the next day, exposed to public ridicule</span>
				<span class='text'> The story paralleled that of Phyllis riding [[Aristotle]]</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|250px|The verse inscription at Virgil's tomb was supposedly composed by the poet himself: ''Mantua me genuit, Calabri rapuere, tenet nunc Parthenope</span>
				<span class='text'>Cecini pascua, rura, duces'' (&quot;[[Mantua]] bore me, the [[Salento|Calabrians]] snatched me away, now [[Naples]] holds me</span>
				<span class='text'>I sang of pastures, countrysides, leaders&quot;)]]The structure known as &quot;[[Virgil's tomb]]&quot; is found at the entrance of an ancient Roman [[tunnel]] (also known as &quot;grotta vecchia&quot;) in [[Piedigrotta]], a district two miles from the centre of Naples, near the [[Mergellina]] harbor, on the road heading north along the coast to [[Pozzuoli]]</span>
				<span class='text'>While Virgil was already the object of literary admiration and veneration before his death, in the Middle Ages his name became associated with miraculous powers, and for a couple of centuries his tomb was the destination of [[pilgrimage]]s and veneration</span>

				<span class='text'>Two explanations are commonly given for this alteration</span>
				<span class='text'>One deduces a false etymology associated with the word ''virgo'' (&quot;maiden&quot; in [[Latin]]) due to Virgil's excessive, &quot;maiden&quot;-like modesty</span>
				<span class='text'>Alternatively, some argue that ''Vergilius'' was altered to ''Virgilius'' by analogy with the Latin ''virga'' (&quot;wand&quot;) due to the magical or prophetic powers attributed to Virgil in the Middle Ages (this explanation is found in only a handful of manuscripts, however, and was probably not widespread)</span>
				<span class='text'>In [[Normans|Norman]] schools (following the [[French language|French]] practice), the habit was to anglicize Latin names by dropping their Latin endings, hence ''Virgil''</span>
				<span class='text'>In the 19th century, some [[German language|German]]-trained [[classics|classicists]] in the United States suggested modification to ''Vergil'', as it is closer to his original name, and is also the traditional German spelling</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Modern usage permits both, though the [[Oxford guide to style]] recommends ''Vergilius'' to avoid confusion with the 8th-century grammarian [[Virgilius Maro Grammaticus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Some post-[[Renaissance]] writers liked to affect the [[sobriquet]] &quot;The Swan of Mantua&quot;</span>
