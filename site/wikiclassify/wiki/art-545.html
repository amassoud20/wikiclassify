				<span class='text'>She also won a [[Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical|Tony Award]] for her work in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] version of ''[[Tovarich (musical)|Tovarich]]'' (1963)</span>
				<span class='text'>fter her drama school education, Leigh appeared in small roles in four films in 1935 and progressed to the role of heroine in ''[[Fire Over England]]'' (1937)</span>
				<span class='text'>Lauded for her beauty, Leigh felt that it sometimes prevented her from being taken seriously as an actress</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite her fame as a screen actress, Leigh was primarily a stage performer</span>
				<span class='text'>During her 30-year stage career, she played roles ranging from the heroines of [[Noël Coward]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]] comedies to classic [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]] characters such as [[Ophelia]], [[Cleopatra VII|Cleopatra]], [[Juliet Capulet|Juliet]], and [[Lady Macbeth]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Later in life, she played [[character role]]s in a few films</span>
				<span class='text'>o the public at the time, Leigh was strongly identified with her second husband [[Laurence Olivier]], to whom she was married from 1940 to 1960</span>
				<span class='text'>Leigh and Olivier starred together in many stage productions, with Olivier often directing, and in three films</span>
				<span class='text'>She earned a reputation for being difficult to work with, as for much of her adult life, she had a [[bipolar disorder]], as well as recurrent bouts of chronic [[tuberculosis]], first diagnosed in the mid-1940s, which ultimately claimed her life at the age of 53</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; At the age of three, young Vivian made her first stage appearance for her mother's amateur theatre group, reciting &quot;[[Little Bo Peep]]&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Gertrude Hartley tried to instil an appreciation of literature in her daughter and introduced her to the works of [[Hans Christian Andersen]], [[Lewis Carroll]] and [[Rudyard Kipling]], as well as stories of [[Greek mythology]] and [[Indian folklore]]</span>

				<span class='text'>30–43</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; She was cast in the play ''The Mask of Virtue'', directed by [[Sidney Carroll]] in 1935 and received excellent reviews, followed by interviews and newspaper articles</span>
				<span class='text'>One such article was from the ''[[Daily Express]]'', in which the interviewer noted &quot;a lightning change came over her face&quot;, which was the first public mention of the rapid changes in mood which had become characteristic of her</span>

				<span class='text'>38&quot;/&gt; She continued with the play; but, when Korda moved it to a larger theatre, Leigh was found to be unable to project her voice adequately or to hold the attention of so large an audience, and the play closed soon after</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Edwards 1978, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>50–55</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In 1960 Leigh recalled her ambivalence towards her first experience of critical acclaim and sudden fame, commenting, &quot;some critics saw fit to be as foolish as to say that I was a great actress</span>
				<span class='text'>And I thought, that was a foolish, wicked thing to say, because it put such an onus and such a responsibility onto me, which I simply wasn't able to carry</span>

				<span class='text'>75–76</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Coleman 2005, p</span>
				<span class='text'>92</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Olivier later recalled an incident when her mood rapidly changed as she was preparing to go onstage</span>
				<span class='text'>Without apparent provocation, she began screaming at him, before suddenly becoming silent and staring into space</span>
				<span class='text'>She was able to perform without mishap; and, by the following day, she had returned to normal with no recollection of the event</span>
				<span class='text'>It was the first time Olivier witnessed such behaviour from her</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Coleman 2005, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>97–98</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; They began living together, as their respective spouses had each refused to grant either of them a divorce</span>

				<span class='text'>92</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Under the moral standards then enforced by the film industry, their relationship had to be kept from public view</span>
				<span class='text'>eigh appeared with [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]], [[Lionel Barrymore]] and Maureen O'Sullivan in ''[[A Yank at Oxford]]'' (1938), the first of her films to receive attention in the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>During production, she developed a reputation for being difficult and unreasonable, partly because she disliked her secondary role but mainly because her petulant antics seemed to be paying dividends</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Walker 1987, p</span>
				<span class='text'>93</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; After dealing with the threat of a lawsuit brought over a frivolous incident, Korda, however, instructed her agent to warn her that her option would not be renewed if her behaviour did not improve</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Walker 1987, p</span>
				<span class='text'>95</span>

				<span class='text'>52</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Myron Selznick, who watched her performances that month in ''Fire Over England'' and ''A Yank at Oxford'', thought her to be excellent, but, in no way, a possible Scarlett, as she was &quot;too British&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Leigh travelled to Los Angeles, however, to be with Olivier and to try to convince David Selznick that she was Scarlett</span>
				<span class='text'>When Myron Selznick, who also represented Olivier, met Leigh, he felt that she possessed the qualities his brother was searching for</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Walker 1987, p</span>
				<span class='text'>113</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; According to legend, Myron Selznick took Leigh and Olivier to the set where the burning of the [[Atlanta]] Depot scene was being filmed and stage-managed an encounter, where he introduced Leigh, derisively addressing his younger brother, &quot;Hey, genius, meet your Scarlett O'Hara</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bean 2013, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>51–53</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The following day, Leigh read a scene for Selznick, who organised a [[screen test]] with director [[George Cukor]], and wrote to his wife, &quot;She's the Scarlett dark horse and looks damn good</span>
				<span class='text'>Not for anyone's ear but your own: it's narrowed down to [[Paulette Goddard]], [[Jean Arthur]], [[Joan Bennett]] and Vivien Leigh&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Cukor was dismissed and replaced by [[Victor Fleming]], with whom Leigh frequently quarrelled</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor 1984, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>22–23&quot;/&gt; On a long-distance telephone call to Olivier, she declared: &quot;Puss, my puss, how I hate film acting! Hate, hate, and never want to do another film again!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor 1984, pp</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Leigh and Olivier in Australia, June 1948]]With her doctor's approval, Leigh was well enough to resume acting in 1946, starring in a successful London production of [[Thornton Wilder]]'s ''[[The Skin of Our Teeth]]''; but her films of this period, ''Caesar and Cleopatra'' (1945) and ''[[Anna Karenina (1948 film)|Anna Karenina]]'' (1948), were not great commercial successes</span>
				<span class='text'>All British films in this period were adversely affected by a Hollywood boycott of British films</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In 1947 Olivier was [[knighthood|knighted]] and Leigh accompanied him to [[Buckingham Palace]] for the investiture</span>

				<span class='text'>327</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;By 1948 Olivier was on the board of directors for the Old Vic Theatre, and he and Leigh embarked on a six-month tour of Australia and New Zealand to raise funds for the theatre</span>
				<span class='text'>Olivier played the lead in  ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' and also performed with Leigh in ''[[The School for Scandal]]'' and ''The Skin of Our Teeth''</span>
				<span class='text'>The tour was an outstanding success and, although Leigh was plagued with [[insomnia]] and allowed her understudy to replace her for a week while she was ill, she generally withstood the demands placed upon her, with Olivier noting her ability to &quot;charm the press&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The most dramatic altercation occurred in [[Christchurch]], New Zealand, when her shoes were not found and Leigh refused to go onstage without shoes</span>
				<span class='text'>An exhausted and exasperated Olivier screamed an obscenity at her and slapped her face, and a devastated Leigh slapped him in return, dismayed that he would hit her publicly</span>
				<span class='text'>Subsequently, she made her way to the stage in borrowed pumps, and in seconds, had &quot;dried her tears and smiled brightly onstage&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>217–218</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the tour, both were exhausted and ill</span>
				<span class='text'>Olivier told a journalist, &quot;You may not know it, but you are talking to a couple of walking corpses</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The success of the tour encouraged the Oliviers to make their first West End appearance together, performing the same works with one addition, ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]],'' included at Leigh's insistence because she wished to play a role in a [[tragedy]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Olivier and Leigh were chagrined that part of the commercial success of the play lay in audience members attending to see what they believed would be a salacious story, rather than the [[Greek tragedy]] that they envisioned</span>
				<span class='text'>The play also had strong supporters,&lt;ref&gt;Coleman 2005, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>227–231</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;After 326 performances, Leigh finished her run, and she was soon engaged to reprise her role as Blanche DuBois in the [[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|film version]]</span>

				<span class='text'>67</span>

				<span class='text'>She'd have crawled over broken glass if she thought it would help her performance</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Tennessee Williams commented that Leigh brought to the role &quot;everything that I intended, and much that I had never dreamed of&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Leigh herself had mixed feelings about her association with the character; in later years, she said that playing Blanche DuBois &quot;tipped me over into madness&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>312–313</span>

				<span class='text'>119</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The reviews there were also mostly positive, but the critic Kenneth Tynan angered them when he suggested that Leigh's was a mediocre talent that forced Olivier to compromise his own</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tynan 1961, p</span>
				<span class='text'>9</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Tynan's diatribe almost precipitated another collapse; Leigh, terrified of failure and intent on achieving greatness, dwelt on his comments and ignored the positive reviews of other critics</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Edwards 1978, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>196–197</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In January 1953, Leigh travelled to Ceylon to film ''[[Elephant Walk]]'' with [[Peter Finch]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Shortly after filming commenced, she had a breakdown and [[Paramount Pictures]] replaced her with [[Elizabeth Taylor]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Taylor 1984, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>93–94</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Olivier returned her to their home in Britain, where, between periods of incoherence, Leigh told him she was in love with Finch and had been having an affair with him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Walker 1987, p</span>
				<span class='text'>213</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; She gradually recovered over a period of several months</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result of this episode, many of the Oliviers' friends learned of her problems</span>
				<span class='text'>[[David Niven]] said she had been &quot;quite, quite mad&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>254–263</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Legacy==Leigh was considered one of the most beautiful actresses of her day, and her directors emphasised this in most of her films</span>
				<span class='text'>When asked if she believed her beauty had been an impediment to being taken seriously as an actress, she said, &quot;People think that if you look fairly reasonable, you can't possibly act, and as I only care about acting, I think beauty can be a great handicap, if you really want to look like the part you're playing, which isn't necessarily like you</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;ActorTalk&quot;/&gt;Director George Cukor described Leigh as a &quot;consummate actress, hampered by beauty&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Shipman 1988, p</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and Laurence Olivier said that critics should &quot;give her credit for being an actress and not go on forever letting their judgments be distorted by her great beauty</span>

				<span class='text'>227</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Garson Kanin shared their viewpoint and described Leigh as &quot;a stunner whose ravishing beauty often tended to obscure her staggering achievements as an actress</span>
				<span class='text'>Great beauties are infrequently great actresses&amp;nbsp;– simply because they don't need to be</span>
				<span class='text'>Vivien was different; ambitious, persevering, serious, often inspired</span>

				<span class='text'>125</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Leigh explained that she played &quot;as many different parts as possible&quot; in an attempt to learn her craft and to dispel prejudice about her abilities</span>
				<span class='text'>She believed that comedy was more difficult to play than drama because it required more precise timing and said that more emphasis should be placed upon comedy as part of an actor's training</span>
				<span class='text'>Nearing the end of her career, which ranged from Noël Coward comedies to Shakespearean tragedies, she observed, &quot;It's much easier to make people cry than to make them laugh</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;ActorTalk&quot;/&gt;Her early performances brought her immediate success in Britain, but she remained largely unknown in other parts of the world until the release of ''Gone with the Wind''</span>
				<span class='text'>In December 1939, film critic [[Frank Nugent]] wrote in ''The New York Times'', &quot;Miss Leigh's Scarlett has vindicated the absurd talent quest that indirectly turned her up</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Her performance in the West End production of ''A Streetcar Named Desire'', described by the theatre writer [[Phyllis Hartnoll]] as &quot;proof of greater powers as an actress than she had hitherto shown&quot;, led to a lengthy period during which she was considered one of the finest actresses in British theatre</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hartnoll 1972, p</span>
				<span class='text'>301</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Discussing the subsequent film version, [[Pauline Kael]] wrote that Leigh and Marlon Brando gave &quot;two of the greatest performances ever put on film&quot; and that Leigh's was &quot;one of those rare performances that can truly be said to evoke both fear and pity</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kael 1982, p</span>
				<span class='text'>564</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Her greatest critic was Kenneth Tynan who ridiculed Leigh's performance opposite Olivier in the 1955 production of ''Titus Andronicus'', commenting that she &quot;receives the news that she is about to be ravished on her husband's corpse with little more than the mild annoyance of one who would have preferred foam rubber</span>
