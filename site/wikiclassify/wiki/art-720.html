				<span class='text'>He is particularly remembered for his applications of mathematics to mechanics, especially [[fluid mechanics]], and for his pioneering work in [[probability]] and [[statistics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His name is commemorated in the [[Bernoulli principle]], a particular example of the [[conservation of energy]], which describes the mathematics of the mechanism underlying the operation of two important technologies of the 20th century: the [[carburetor]] and the airplane [[wing]]</span>

				<span class='text'>After a brief period in Frankfurt the family moved to Basel, in Switzerland</span>

				<span class='text'>Upon both of them entering and tying for first place in a scientific contest at the [[University of Paris]], Johann, unable to bear the &quot;shame&quot; of being compared as Daniel's equal, banned Daniel from his house</span>
				<span class='text'>Johann Bernoulli also plagiarized some key ideas from Daniel's book ''[[Hydrodynamica]]'' in his own book ''Hydraulica'' which he backdated to before ''Hydrodynamica''</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite Daniel's attempts at reconciliation, his father carried the grudge until his death</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;mactutor&quot;&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Bernoulli_Daniel}} (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;Around schooling age, his father, Johann, encouraged him to study business, there being poor rewards awaiting a mathematician</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Daniel refused, because he wanted to study mathematics</span>
				<span class='text'>He later gave in to his father's wish and studied business</span>
				<span class='text'>His father then asked him to study in [[medicine]], and Daniel agreed under the condition that his father would teach him mathematics privately, which they continued for some time</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;mactutor&quot;/&gt;  Daniel studied medicine in Basel, [[Heidelberg]], and [[Strasbourg]], and earned a PhD in anatomy and botany in 1721</span>

				<span class='text'>He went to [[Saint Petersburg|St</span>
				<span class='text'>Petersburg]] in 1724 as professor of mathematics, but was very unhappy there, and a temporary illness in 1733 gave him an excuse for leaving St</span>
				<span class='text'>Petersberg</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;mactutor&quot;/&gt; He returned to the [[University of Basel]], where he successively held the chairs  of [[medicine]], [[metaphysics]], and [[natural philosophy]] until his death</span>

				<span class='text'> Two years later he pointed out for the first time the frequent desirability of resolving a compound motion into motions of translation and motion of rotation</span>
				<span class='text'> His chief work is ''Hydrodynamica'', published in 1738; it resembles [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]]'s ''Mécanique Analytique'' in being arranged so that all the results are consequences of a single principle, namely, [[conservation of energy]]</span>
				<span class='text'> This was followed by a memoir on the theory of the tides, to which, conjointly with the memoirs by Euler and [[Colin Maclaurin]], a prize was awarded by the [[French Academy]]: these three memoirs contain all that was done on this subject between the publication of [[Isaac Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' and the investigations of [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Bernoulli also wrote a large number of papers on various mechanical questions, especially on problems connected with [[vibrating string]]s, and the solutions given by [[Brook Taylor]] and by [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ball&quot;/&gt;Together Bernoulli and Euler tried to discover more about the flow of fluids</span>
				<span class='text'>In particular, they wanted to know about the relationship between the speed at which blood flows and its pressure</span>
				<span class='text'>To investigate this, Daniel experimented by puncturing the wall of a pipe with a small open ended straw and noted that the height to which the fluid rose up the straw was related to fluid's pressure in the pipe</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;The Turner Collection, Keele University, includes Bernoulli's diagram to illustrate how pressure is measured</span>
				<span class='text'>See also part of Bernoulli's original Latin explanation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Soon physicians all over Europe were measuring patients' blood pressure by sticking point-ended glass tubes directly into their arteries</span>
				<span class='text'>It was not until about 170 years later, in 1896 that an Italian doctor discovered a less painful method which is still in use today</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Bernoulli's method of measuring pressure is still used today in modern aircraft to measure the speed of the air passing the plane; that is its air speed</span>
				<span class='text'>aking his discoveries further, Daniel Bernoulli now returned to his earlier work on Conservation of Energy</span>
				<span class='text'>It was known that a moving body exchanges its kinetic energy for potential energy when it gains height</span>
				<span class='text'>Daniel realised that in a similar way, a moving fluid exchanges its kinetic energy for pressure</span>
				<span class='text'>Mathematically this law is now written:: &lt;math&gt;\tfrac12 \rho u^2 + P = \text{constant} &lt;/math&gt;where P is pressure, ρ is the density of the fluid and u is its velocity</span>
				<span class='text'>A consequence of this law is that if the velocity increases then the pressure falls</span>
				<span class='text'>This is exploited by the wing of an aeroplane which is designed to create an area above its surface where the air velocity increases</span>
				<span class='text'>The pressure in this area is lower than that under the wing, so the wing is pushed upwards by the relatively higher pressure under the wing</span>
