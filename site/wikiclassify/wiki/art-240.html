				<span class='text'>} fully '''Hannibal&amp;nbsp;[[Barcids|Barca]]''', was a [[Punics|Punic]] [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginian]] military commander, generally considered one of the greatest military commanders in history</span>
				<span class='text'>His father [[Hamilcar Barca]] was the leading Carthaginian commander during the [[First Punic War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His younger brothers were [[Mago (Barcid)|Mago]] and [[Hasdrubal (Barcid)|Hasdrubal]], and he was brother-in-law to [[Hasdrubal the Fair]]</span>
				<span class='text'>annibal lived during a period of great tension in the [[Mediterranean]], when the [[Roman Republic]] established its supremacy over other great powers such as [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]] and the Hellenistic kingdoms of [[Macedon]], [[Syracuse, Italy#Greek period|Syracuse]], and the [[Seleucid Empire]]</span>
				<span class='text'>One of his most famous achievements was at the outbreak of the [[Second Punic War]], when he [[Hannibal's Crossing of the Alps|marched an army]] which included [[elephants]] from [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] over the [[Pyrenees]] and the [[Alps]] into [[Italy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In his first few years in Italy, he won three dramatic victories‚Äî[[Battle of Trebia|Trebia]], [[Battle of Lake Trasimene|Trasimene]], and [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]], in which he distinguished himself for his ability to determine his and his opponent's strengths and weaknesses, and to play the battle to his strengths and the enemy's weaknesses‚Äîand won over many allies of Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>Hannibal occupied much of Italy for 15 years, but a Roman counter-invasion of [[North Africa]] forced him to return to Carthage, where he was decisively defeated by [[Scipio Africanus]] at the [[Battle of Zama]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Scipio had studied Hannibal's tactics and brilliantly devised some of his own, and finally defeated Rome's nemesis at Zama, having previously driven Hannibal's brother Hasdrubal out of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]</span>
				<span class='text'>fter the war, Hannibal successfully ran for the office of [[shofet|suffete]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He enacted political and financial reforms to enable the payment of the war indemnity imposed by Rome; however, Hannibal's reforms were unpopular with members of the Carthaginian aristocracy and in Rome, and he fled into voluntary exile</span>
				<span class='text'>During this time, he lived at the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] court, where he acted as military advisor to [[Antiochus III]] in his war against Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>Antiochus met defeat at the [[Battle of Magnesia]] and was forced to accept Rome's terms, and Hannibal fled again, making a stop in [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His flight ended in the court of [[Bithynia]], where he achieved an outstanding naval victory against a fleet from [[Pergamon]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was afterwards betrayed to the Romans and committed suicide by poisoning himself</span>
				<span class='text'>annibal is often regarded as one of the greatest military strategists in history and one of the greatest generals of antiquity, together with [[Alexander the Great]], [[Julius Caesar]], [[Scipio Africanus|Scipio]], and [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Plutarch]] states that Hannibal was questioned by Scipio as to who was the greatest general, and Hannibal replied either Alexander or Pyrrhus, then himself,&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, and when asked what his choices would be if he had beaten Scipio, he replied that he would be the best of them all ''Life of Titus Flamininus'' 21</span>
				<span class='text'>-4</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; or, according to another version of the event, Pyrrhus, Scipio, then himself</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Pyrrhus'' 8</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Military historian [[Theodore Ayrault Dodge]] called Hannibal the ''&quot;father of strategy&quot;'',&lt;ref name=&quot;dodge&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Hannibal: A History of the Art of War Among the Carthaginians and Romans Down to the Battle of Pydna, 168 BC|first=Theodore |last=Ayrault Dodge|publisher=Da Capo Press |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; because his greatest enemy, Rome, came to adopt elements of his military tactics in its own strategic arsenal</span>
				<span class='text'>This praise has earned him a strong reputation in the modern world, and he was regarded as a great strategist by men like [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Name==The [[anglicization of names|English form]] of the name is derived from the [[latinization of names|Latin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Greek historiography|Greek historians]] rendered the name as ''Ann√≠bas B√°rkas'' ({{lang|grc|·ºàŒΩŒΩŒØŒ≤Œ±œÇ ŒíŒ¨œÅŒ∫Œ±œÇ}})</span>
				<span class='text'>annibal was his [[given name]]</span>

				<span class='text'>81‚Äì2&lt;/ref&gt;==Background and early career==Hannibal was one of the sons of [[Hamilcar Barca]], a Carthaginian leader</span>
				<span class='text'>He had several sisters and two brothers, [[Hasdrubal (Barcid)|Hasdrubal]] and [[Mago (Barcid)|Mago]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His brothers-in-law were [[Hasdrubal the Fair]] and the Numidian king [[Chief Naravas|Naravas]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was still a child when his sisters married, and his brothers-in-law were close associates during his father's struggles in the [[Mercenary War]] and the Punic conquest of Iberia</span>
				<span class='text'>In light of Hamilcar Barca's [[cognomen]], historians refer to Hamilcar's family as the [[Barcid]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>However, there is debate as to whether the cognomen Barca (meaning &quot;thunderbolt&quot;) was applied to Hamilcar alone or was hereditary within his family</span>
				<span class='text'>If the latter, then Hannibal and his brothers also bore the name 'Barca'</span>

				<span class='text'>'''Hannibal''' p</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;After Carthage's defeat in the [[First Punic War]], Hamilcar set out to improve his family's and Carthage's fortunes</span>
				<span class='text'>With that in mind and supported by [[Gades]], Hamilcar began the subjugation of the tribes of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Carthage at the time was in such a poor state that its navy was unable to transport his army to [[Iberian peninsula|Iberia]] ([[Hispania]]); instead, Hamilcar had to march it towards the [[Pillars of Hercules]] and transport it across the [[Strait of Gibraltar]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}According to [[Polybius]], Hannibal much later said that when he came upon his father and begged to go with him, Hamilcar agreed and demanded that he swear that as long as he lived he would never be a friend of Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>There is even an account of him at a very young age begging his father to take him to an overseas war</span>
				<span class='text'>In the story, Hannibal's father took him up and brought him to a sacrificial chamber</span>
				<span class='text'>Hamilcar held Hannibal over the fire roaring in the chamber and made him swear that he would never be a friend of Rome</span>

				<span class='text'>Hannibal not only perceived this as a breach of the treaty signed with Hasdrubal, but as he was already planning an attack on Rome, this was his way to start the war</span>
				<span class='text'>So he laid [[siege]] to the city, which fell after eight months</span>
				<span class='text'>Rome reacted to this apparent violation of the treaty and demanded justice from Carthage</span>
				<span class='text'>In view of Hannibal's great popularity, the Carthaginian government did not repudiate Hannibal's actions, and the war he sought was declared at the end of the year</span>

				<span class='text'>annibal's vision of military affairs was derived partly from the teaching of his Greek tutors and partly from experience gained alongside his father, and it stretched over most of the Hellenistic World of his time</span>
				<span class='text'>Indeed, the breadth of his vision gave rise to his grand strategy of conquering Rome by opening a northern front and subduing allied city-states on the peninsula, rather than by attacking Rome directly</span>
				<span class='text'>Historical events which led to the defeat of Carthage during the First Punic War when his father commanded the Carthaginian Army also led Hannibal to plan the invasion of Italy by land across the Alps</span>
				<span class='text'>he task was daunting, to say the least</span>
				<span class='text'>It involved the mobilization of between 60,000 and 100,000 troops (see Proctor, 1971) and the training of a war-elephant corps, all of which had to be provisioned along the way</span>
				<span class='text'>The alpine invasion of Italy was a military operation that would shake the Mediterranean World of 218&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}} with repercussions for more than two decades</span>

				<span class='text'>if|thumb|right|300px|A diagram depicting the tactics used in the [[Battle of Trebia]]]]Hannibal's perilous march brought him into the Roman territory and frustrated the attempts of the enemy to fight out the main issue on foreign ground</span>
				<span class='text'>His sudden appearance among the [[Gaul]]s of the [[Po River|Po]] Valley, moreover, enabled him to detach those tribes from their new allegiance to the Romans before the Romans could take steps to check the rebellion</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Publius Cornelius Scipio]] was the consul who commanded the Roman force sent to intercept Hannibal (he was also Scipio Africanus' father)</span>
				<span class='text'>He had not expected Hannibal to make an attempt to cross the Alps, since the Romans were prepared to fight the war in [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>With a small detachment still positioned in Gaul, Scipio made an attempt to intercept Hannibal</span>
				<span class='text'>He succeeded, through prompt decision and speedy movement, in transporting his army to Italy by sea in time to meet Hannibal</span>
				<span class='text'>Hannibal's forces moved through the Po Valley and were engaged in a large scale skirmish at [[Battle of Ticinus|Ticinus]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Scipio was severely injured, his life only saved by the bravery of his son who rode back onto the field to rescue his fallen father</span>
				<span class='text'>Scipio retreated across the river Trebia to camp at [[Piacenza|Placentia]] with his army mostly intact</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;dodge_old&quot; /&gt;The other [[Roman consul]]ar army was rushed to the Po Valley</span>
				<span class='text'>Even before news of the defeat at Ticinus had reached Rome, the Senate had ordered Consul [[Sempronius Longus]] to bring his army back from Sicily to meet Scipio and face Hannibal</span>
				<span class='text'>Hannibal, by skillful maneuvers, was in position to head him off, for he lay on the direct road between Placentia and Arminum, by which Sempronius would have to march to reinforce Scipio</span>
				<span class='text'>He then captured Clastidium, from which he drew large amounts of supplies for his men</span>
				<span class='text'>But this gain was not without loss, as Sempronius avoided Hannibal's watchfulness, slipped around his flank, and joined his colleague in his camp near the [[Trebbia|Trebia River]] near [[Piacenza|Placentia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>There Hannibal had an opportunity to show his masterful military skill at [[Battle of Trebia|Trebia]] in December of the same year, after wearing down the superior Roman [[infantry]], when he cut it to pieces with a surprise attack and ambush from the flanks</span>

				<span class='text'>As Polybius recounts, &quot;he [Hannibal] calculated that, if he passed the camp and made a descent into the district beyond, Flaminius (partly for fear of popular reproach and partly of personal irritation) would be unable to endure watching passively the devastation of the country but would spontaneously follow him</span>
				<span class='text'></span>

				<span class='text'>Despite this, Flaminius remained passively encamped at Arretium</span>
				<span class='text'>Hannibal marched boldly around Flaminius' left flank, unable to draw him into battle by mere devastation, and effectively cut him off from Rome (thus executing the first recorded [[turning movement]] in military history)</span>
				<span class='text'>He then advanced through the uplands of [[Etruria]], provoking Flaminius into a hasty pursuit and catching him in a [[defile (geography)|defile]] on the shore of [[Lake Trasimeno|Lake Trasimenus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>There Hannibal destroyed Flaminius' army in the waters or on the adjoining slopes, killing Flaminius as well (see [[Battle of Lake Trasimene]])</span>
				<span class='text'>This was the most costly ambush that the Romans ever sustained until the [[Battle of Carrhae]] against the [[Parthians]]</span>
				<span class='text'>annibal had now disposed of the only field force that could check his advance upon Rome, but he realized that, without [[siege engine]]s, he could not hope to take the capital</span>
				<span class='text'>He preferred to exploit his victory by entering into central and southern Italy and encouraging a general revolt against the sovereign power</span>

				<span class='text'>Departing from Roman military traditions, Fabius adopted the [[Fabian strategy|strategy named after him]], avoiding open battle while placing several Roman armies in Hannibal's vicinity in order to watch and limit his movements</span>
				<span class='text'>annibal ravaged Apulia but was unable to bring Fabius to battle, so he decided to march through [[Samnium]] to [[Campania]], one of the richest and most fertile provinces of Italy, hoping that the devastation would draw Fabius into battle</span>
				<span class='text'>Fabius closely followed Hannibal's path of destruction, yet still refused to let himself be drawn out of the defensive</span>
				<span class='text'>This strategy was unpopular with many Romans, who believed that it was a form of cowardice</span>
				<span class='text'>annibal decided that it would be unwise to winter in the already devastated lowlands of Campania, but Fabius had ensured that all the passes were blocked out of Campania</span>
				<span class='text'>To avoid this, Hannibal deceived the Romans into thinking that the Carthaginian army was going to escape through the woods</span>
				<span class='text'>As the Romans moved off towards the woods, Hannibal's army occupied the pass, and then made their way through the pass unopposed</span>
				<span class='text'>Fabius was within striking distance but in this case his caution worked against him</span>
				<span class='text'>Smelling a stratagem (rightly), he stayed put</span>
				<span class='text'>For the winter, Hannibal found comfortable quarters in the [[Apulia]]n plain</span>
				<span class='text'>What Hannibal achieved in extricating his army was, as [[Adrian Goldsworthy]] puts it, &quot;a classic of ancient generalship, finding its way into nearly every historical narrative of the war and being used by later military manuals&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>In the meantime, the Romans hoped to gain success through sheer strength and weight of numbers, and they raised a new army of unprecedented size, estimated by some to be as large as 100,000 men, but more likely around 50-80,000</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;cottrell&quot;&gt;Cottrell, Leonard, ''Enemy of Rome'', Evans Bros, 1965, ISBN 0-237-44320-1&lt;/ref&gt;The Romans and allied legions resolved to confront Hannibal and marched southward to [[Apulia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>They eventually found him on the left bank of the Aufidus River, and encamped six miles (10&amp;nbsp;km) away</span>
				<span class='text'>On this occasion, the two armies were combined into one, the consuls having to alternate their command on a daily basis</span>
				<span class='text'>Varro was in command on the first day, a man of reckless and hubristic nature (according to Livy) and determined to defeat Hannibal</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;cottrell&quot;/&gt; Hannibal capitalized on the eagerness of Varro and drew him into a trap by using an [[Pincer movement|envelopment tactic]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This eliminated the Roman numerical advantage by shrinking the combat area</span>
				<span class='text'>Hannibal drew up his least reliable infantry in a semicircle in the center with the wings composed of the Gallic and Numidian horse</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;cottrell&quot;/&gt; The Roman legions forced their way through Hannibal's weak center, but the Libyan mercenaries on the wings, swung around by the movement, menaced their flanks</span>
				<span class='text'>The onslaught of Hannibal's cavalry was irresistible</span>
				<span class='text'>Hannibal's chief cavalry commander [[Maharbal]] led the mobile [[Numidian cavalry]] on the right, and they shattered the Roman cavalry opposing them</span>
				<span class='text'>Hannibal's Iberian and Gallic heavy cavalry, led by Hanno on the left, defeated the Roman heavy cavalry, and then both the Carthaginian heavy cavalry and the Numidians attacked the legions from behind</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, the Roman army was hemmed in with no means of escape</span>
				<span class='text'>ue to these brilliant tactics, Hannibal managed to surround and destroy all but a small remnant of his enemy, despite his own inferior numbers</span>
				<span class='text'>Depending upon the source, it is estimated that 50,000-70,000 Romans were killed or captured</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;dodge&quot; /&gt; Among the dead were Roman Consul [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus (consul 219 BC)|Lucius Aemilius Paullus]], as well as two consuls for the preceding year, two [[quaestor]]s, twenty-nine out of the forty-eight [[military tribune]]s, and an additional eighty senators (at a time when the Roman Senate was composed of no more than 300 men, this constituted 25%‚Äì30% of the governing body)</span>
				<span class='text'>This makes the battle one of the most catastrophic defeats in the history of [[Ancient Rome]], and one of the bloodiest battles in all of human history (in terms of the number of lives lost within a single day)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;cottrell&quot;/&gt;After Cannae, the Romans were very hesitant to confront Hannibal in pitched battle, preferring instead to weaken him by attrition, relying on their advantages of interior lines, supply, and manpower</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, Hannibal fought no more major battles in Italy for the rest of the war</span>
				<span class='text'>It is believed that his refusal to bring the war to Rome itself was due to a lack of commitment from Carthage of men, money, and materiel&amp;nbsp;‚Äî principally siege equipment</span>
				<span class='text'>Whatever the reason, the choice prompted Maharbal to say, &quot;Hannibal, you know how to gain a victory, but not how to use one</span>

				<span class='text'>Hannibal also secured an alliance with newly appointed [[Hieronymus of Syracuse]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It is often argued that, if Hannibal had received proper material reinforcements from Carthage, he might have succeeded with a direct attack upon Rome</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;dodge&quot; /&gt; For the next few years, Hannibal was forced to sustain a [[scorched earth]] policy and obtain local provisions for protracted and ineffectual operations throughout southern Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>His immediate objectives were reduced to minor operations centered mainly round the cities of [[Campania]]</span>
				<span class='text'>he forces detached to his lieutenants were generally unable to hold their own, and neither his home government nor his new ally Philip V of Macedon helped to make up his losses</span>
				<span class='text'>His position in southern Italy, therefore, became increasingly difficult and his chance of ultimately conquering Rome grew ever more remote</span>
				<span class='text'>Hannibal still won a number of notable victories: completely destroying two Roman armies in 212&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}, and killing two consuls (including the famed [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]]) in a battle in 208&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Hannibal slowly began losing ground‚Äîinadequately supported by his Italian allies, abandoned by his government (either because of jealousy or simply because Carthage was overstretched), and unable to match Rome's resources</span>
				<span class='text'>He was never able to bring about another grand decisive victory that could produce a lasting strategic change</span>
				<span class='text'>arthaginian political will was embodied in the ruling oligarchy</span>
				<span class='text'>There was a Carthaginian Senate, but the real power was with the inner &quot;[[Council of 30 Nobles]]&quot; and the board of judges from ruling families known as the &quot;[[Hundred and Four]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>These two bodies came from the wealthy, commercial families of Carthage</span>
				<span class='text'>Two political factions operated in Carthage: the war party, also known as the &quot;[[Barcid]]s&quot; (Hannibal's family name); and the peace party led by [[Hanno the Great#Hanno II the Great|Hanno II the Great]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Hanno had been instrumental in denying Hannibal's requested reinforcements following the battle at Cannae</span>
				<span class='text'>annibal started the war without the full backing of Carthaginian oligarchy</span>
				<span class='text'>His attack of Saguntum had presented the oligarchy with a choice of war with Rome or loss of prestige in Iberia</span>
				<span class='text'>The oligarchy, not Hannibal, controlled the strategic resources of Carthage</span>
				<span class='text'>Hannibal constantly sought reinforcements from either Iberia or North Africa</span>
				<span class='text'>Hannibal's troops who were lost in combat were replaced with less well-trained and motivated mercenaries from Italy or Gaul</span>
				<span class='text'>The commercial interests of the Carthaginian oligarchy dictated the reinforcement and supply of Iberia rather than Hannibal throughout the campaign</span>
				<span class='text'>==Hannibal's retreat in Italy===In 212&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}, Hannibal captured [[Taranto|Tarentum]] but he failed to obtain control of its harbour</span>
				<span class='text'>The tide was slowly turning against him, and in favor of Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>he Romans then mounted two sieges of Capua, which fell in 211&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}, and completed their conquest of Syracuse and destruction of the Carthaginian army in Sicily</span>
				<span class='text'>Shortly thereafter, the Romans pacified Sicily and entered into an alliance with the [[Aetolian League]] to counter Phillip V</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip, who attempted to exploit Rome's preoccupation in Italy to conquer [[Illyria]], now found himself under attack from several sides at once and was quickly subdued by Rome and her Greek allies</span>
				<span class='text'>Meanwhile, Hannibal had defeated Fulvius at the battle of Herdonia in Apulia, but lost Tarentum the following year</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Isis priest01 pushkin</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|[[Scipio Africanus]]]]In 210&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}, Hannibal again proved his superiority in tactics by inflicting a severe defeat at Herdonia (modern [[Ordona]]) in Apulia upon a [[proconsul]]ar army and, in 208&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}, destroyed a Roman force engaged in the siege of [[Locri|Locri Epizephyri]]</span>
				<span class='text'>But with the loss of Tarentum in 209&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}} and the gradual reconquest by the Romans of [[Samnium]] and [[Lucania]], his hold on south Italy was almost lost</span>
				<span class='text'>In 207&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}, he succeeded in making his way again into Apulia, where he waited to concert measures for a combined march upon Rome with his brother [[Hasdrubal Barca]]</span>
				<span class='text'>On hearing, however, of his brother's defeat and death at the [[Battle of the Metaurus|Metaurus]] he retired into [[Bruttium]], where he maintained himself for the ensuing years</span>

				<span class='text'>In 202&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}, Hannibal met Scipio in a fruitless peace conference</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite mutual admiration, negotiations floundered due to Roman allegations of &quot;Punic Faith,&quot; referring to the breach of protocols that ended the First Punic War by the Carthaginian attack on Saguntum, and a Carthaginan attack on a stranded Roman fleet</span>
				<span class='text'>Scipio and Carthage had worked out a peace plan, which was approved by Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>The terms of the treaty were quite modest, but the war had been long for the Romans</span>
				<span class='text'>Carthage could keep its African territory but would lose its overseas empire, a ''[[fait accompli]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Masinissa ([[Numidia]]) was to be independent</span>
				<span class='text'>Also, Carthage was to reduce its fleet and pay a war indemnity</span>
				<span class='text'>But Carthage then made a terrible blunder</span>
				<span class='text'>Its long-suffering citizens had captured a stranded Roman fleet in the [[Gulf of Tunis]] (Tunisia) and stripped it of supplies, an action that aggravated the faltering negotiations</span>
				<span class='text'>Meanwhile, Hannibal, recalled from Italy by the Carthaginian Senate, had returned with his army</span>
				<span class='text'>Fortified by both Hannibal and the supplies, the Carthaginians rebuffed the treaty and Roman protests</span>
				<span class='text'>The decisive battle at [[Battle of Zama|Zama]] soon followed; the defeat removed Hannibal's air of invincibility</span>
				<span class='text'>==Battle of Zama==={{Main|Battle of Zama}}Unlike most battles of the [[Second Punic War]], at Zama, the Romans were superior in cavalry and the Carthaginians had the edge in infantry</span>
				<span class='text'>This Roman cavalry superiority was due to the betrayal of [[Masinissa]], who had earlier assisted Carthage in Iberia, but changed sides in 206&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}} with the promise of land and due to his personal conflicts with [[Syphax]], a Carthaginian ally</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the aging Hannibal was suffering from mental exhaustion and deteriorating health after years of campaigning in Italy, the Carthaginians still had the advantage in numbers and were boosted by the presence of 80 war elephants</span>

				<span class='text'>]The Roman cavalry won an early victory by swiftly routing the Carthaginian horse, and standard Roman tactics for limiting the effectiveness of the Carthaginian war elephants were successful, including playing trumpets to frighten the elephants into running into the Carthaginian lines</span>
				<span class='text'>Some historians say that the elephants routed the Carthaginian cavalry and not the Romans, whilst others suggest that it was actually a tactical retreat planned by Hannibal</span>

				<span class='text'>At one point, it seemed that Hannibal was on the verge of victory, but Scipio was able to rally his men, and his cavalry, having routed the Carthaginian cavalry, attacked Hannibal's rear</span>
				<span class='text'>This two-pronged attack caused the Carthaginian formation to collapse</span>

				<span class='text'>Carthage lost approximately 20,000 troops with an additional 15,000 wounded</span>

				<span class='text'>Following the conclusion of a peace that left Carthage stripped of its formerly mighty empire, Hannibal prepared to take a back seat for a time</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the blatant corruption of the [[oligarchy]] gave Hannibal a chance to re-emerge and he was elected as ''[[shofet|suffete]]'' or chief [[magistrate]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The office had become rather insignificant, but Hannibal restored its power and authority</span>
				<span class='text'>The oligarchy, always jealous of him, had even charged him with having betrayed the interests of his country while in Italy, for neglecting to take Rome when he might have done so</span>
				<span class='text'>So effectively did Hannibal reform abuses that the heavy tribute imposed by Rome could be paid by installments without additional and extraordinary taxation</span>
				<span class='text'>He also reformed the [[Hundred and Four]], stipulating that its membership be chosen by direct election rather than co-option</span>
				<span class='text'>He also used citizen support to change the term of office in the Hundred and Four from life to a year, with a term limit of two years</span>

				<span class='text'>He advised equipping a fleet and landing a body of troops in the south of Italy, offering to take command himself</span>

				<span class='text'>He replied, &quot;I have seen during my life many old fools; but this one beats them all</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Another story according to [[Aulus Gellius]] is that when Antiochus III showed off the gigantic and elaborately equipped army he had created to invade Greece to Hannibal, he asked him if they would be enough for the Roman Republic, to which Hannibal replied, &quot;I think all this will be enough, yes, quite enough, for the Romans, even though they are most avaricious</span>

				<span class='text'>]Hannibal is generally regarded as one of the best military strategists and tacticians of all time, the double envelopment at Cannae an enduring legacy of tactical brilliance</span>
				<span class='text'>According to [[Appian]], several years after the Second Punic War, Hannibal served as a political advisor in the Seleucid Kingdom and [[Scipio Africanus|Scipio]] was sent there on a diplomatic mission from Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>{quote|It is said that at one of their meetings in the gymnasium Scipio and Hannibal had a conversation on the subject of generalship, in the presence of a number of bystanders, and that Scipio asked Hannibal whom he considered the greatest general, to which the latter replied, &quot;[[Alexander of Macedonia]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>o this Scipio assented since he also yielded the first place to Alexander</span>
				<span class='text'>Then he asked Hannibal whom he placed next, and he replied, &quot;[[Pyrrhus of Epirus]]&quot;, because he considered boldness the first qualification of a general; &quot;for it would not be possible&quot;, he said, &quot;to find two kings more enterprising than these&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>cipio was rather nettled by this, but nevertheless he asked Hannibal to whom he would give the third place, expecting that at least the third would be assigned to him; but Hannibal replied, &quot;to myself; for when I was a young man I conquered Hispania and crossed the Alps with an army, the first after [[Hercules]]</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;As Scipio saw that he was likely to prolong his self-laudation he said, laughing, &quot;where would you place yourself, Hannibal, if you had not been defeated by me?&quot; Hannibal, now perceiving his jealousy, replied, &quot;in that case I should have put myself before Alexander&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus Hannibal continued his self-laudation, but flattered Scipio in a indirect manner by suggesting that he had conquered one who was the superior of Alexander</span>
				<span class='text'>t the end of this conversation Hannibal invited Scipio to be his guest, and Scipio replied that he would be so gladly if Hannibal were not living with [[Antiochus III the Great|Antiochus]], who was held in suspicion by the Romans</span>

				<span class='text'>In the use of strategies and [[ambuscade]]s he certainly surpassed all other generals of antiquity</span>
				<span class='text'>Wonderful as his achievements were, we must marvel the more when we take into account the grudging support he received from Carthage</span>
				<span class='text'>As his veterans melted away, he had to organize fresh levies on the spot</span>
				<span class='text'>We never hear of a mutiny in his army, composed though it was of North Africans, Iberians and [[Gauls]]</span>

				<span class='text'>The Romans feared and hated him so much that they could not do him justice</span>
				<span class='text'>Livy speaks of his great qualities, but he adds that his vices were equally great, among which he singles out his more than Punic perfidy and an inhuman cruelty</span>
				<span class='text'>For the first there would seem to be no further justification than that he was consummately skillful in the use of ambuscades</span>
				<span class='text'>For the latter there is, we believe, no more ground than that at certain crises he acted in the general spirit of ancient warfare</span>

				<span class='text'>No such brutality stains his name as that perpetrated by [[Gaius Claudius Nero|Claudius Nero]] on the vanquished Hasdrubal</span>

				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;423:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;It is a remarkable and very cogent proof of Hannibal's having been by nature a real leader and far superior to anyone else in statesmanship, that though he spent seventeen years in the field, passed through so many barbarous countries, and employed to aid him in desperate and extraordinary enterprises numbers of men of different nations and languages, no one ever dreamt of conspiring against him, nor was he ever deserted by those who had once joined him or submitted to him</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Count [[Alfred von Schlieffen]] developed his eponymously titled &quot;[[Schlieffen Plan]]&quot; (1905/1906) from his military studies, with a particularly heavy emphasis on the envelopment technique which Hannibal employed to surround and destroy the Roman army at [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]]</span>

				<span class='text'>But those same principles of war that applied to the days of Hannibal apply today</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Carlton, James, ''The Military Quotation Book'', New York City, New York, Thomas Dunne Books, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;According to the military historian [[Theodore Ayrault Dodge]],{{quote|Hannibal excelled as a [[military tactics|tactician]]</span>
				<span class='text'>No battle in history is a finer sample of tactics than [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]]</span>
				<span class='text'>But he was yet greater in logistics and strategy</span>
				<span class='text'>No captain ever marched to and fro among so many armies of troops superior to his own numbers and material as fearlessly and skillfully as he</span>
				<span class='text'>No man ever held his own so long or so ably against such odds</span>
				<span class='text'>Constantly overmatched by better soldiers, led by generals always respectable, often of great ability, he yet defied all their efforts to drive him from Italy, for half a generation</span>
				<span class='text'>Excepting in the case of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]], and some few isolated instances, all wars up to the [[Second Punic War]], had been decided largely, if not entirely, by battle-tactics</span>
				<span class='text'>Strategic ability had been comprehended only on a minor scale</span>
				<span class='text'>Armies had marched towards each other, had fought in parallel order, and the conqueror had imposed terms on his opponent</span>
				<span class='text'>Any variation from this rule consisted in [[ambuscade]]s or other stratagems</span>
				<span class='text'>That war could be waged by avoiding in lieu of seeking battle; that the results of a victory could be earned by attacks upon the enemy's communications, by flank-maneuvers, by seizing positions from which safely to threaten him in case he moved, and by other devices of strategy, was not understood</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>[However] For the first time in the history of war, we see two contending generals avoiding each other, occupying impregnable camps on heights, marching about each other's flanks to seize cities or supplies in their rear, harassing each other with small-war, and rarely venturing on a battle which might prove a fatal disaster‚Äîall with a well-conceived purpose of placing his opponent at a strategic disadvantage</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>That it did so was due to the teaching of Hannibal</span>
