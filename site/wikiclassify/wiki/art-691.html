				<span class='text'>The latter included ''Sarah Bernhardt √† Belle-Isle'' (1912), a film about her daily life at home</span>
				<span class='text'>=Later career==In 1905, while performing in [[Victorien Sardou]]'s ''[[La Tosca]]'' in Teatro L√≠rico do Rio de Janeiro, Bernhardt injured her right knee when jumping off the parapet in the final scene</span>
				<span class='text'>The leg never healed properly</span>
				<span class='text'>By 1915, [[gangrene]] set in and her entire right leg was [[amputate]]d; she was required to use a [[wheelchair]] for several months</span>
				<span class='text'>Bernhardt reportedly refused a $10,000 offer by a [[showman]] to display her amputated leg as a medical curiosity</span>
				<span class='text'>(While [[P</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Barnum]] is usually cited as the one to have made the offer, he had been dead since 1891</span>
				<span class='text'>She continued her career, sometimes without using a wooden [[prosthetic limb]], which she did not like</span>
				<span class='text'>She carried out a successful tour of America in 1915, and on returning to France she played in her own productions almost continuously until her death</span>
				<span class='text'>Later successes included ''Daniel'' (1920), ''La Gloire'' (1921), and ''R√©gine Armand'' (1922)</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Arthur Croxton, the manager of London's Coliseum, the amputation was not apparent during her performances, which were done with the use of the artificial limb</span>
