				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;41</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;For the period prior to Augustine's arrival in 597, Bede drew on earlier writers, including [[Solinus]]</span>

				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;163</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  He used [[Constantius of Lyon|Constantius]]'s ''Life of Germanus'' as a source for [[Germanus of Auxerre|Germanus]]'s visits to Britain</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Farmer_25/&gt;  Bede's account of the invasion of the Anglo-Saxons is drawn largely from [[Gildas]]'s ''[[De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;204</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Bede would also have been familiar with more recent accounts such as [[Eddius Stephanus]]'s ''[[Life of Wilfrid]]'', and anonymous ''Lives'' of Gregory the Great and Cuthbert</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Farmer_25 /&gt; He also drew on [[Josephus]]'s ''Antiquities'', and the works of [[Cassiodorus]],&lt;ref name=Mey831&gt;{{harvnb|Meyvaert|1996|p=831}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there was a copy of the ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'' in Bede's monastery</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=CM_xxv&gt;{{harvnb|Colgrave|Mynors|1969|pp=xxv–xxvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it is clear he was familiar with the works of [[Virgil]] and with [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', and his monastery also owned copies of the works of [[Dionysius Exiguus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=CM_xxv/&gt; He probably drew his account of St</span>

				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;164</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Some of Bede's material came from oral traditions, including a description of the physical appearance of [[Paulinus of York]], who had died nearly 90 years before Bede's ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' was written</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=LH_164/&gt;Bede also had correspondents who supplied him with material</span>
				<span class='text'>Albinus, the abbot of the monastery in Canterbury, provided much information about the church in Kent, and with the assistance of [[Nothelm|Nothhelm]], at that time a priest in London, obtained copies of [[Gregory the Great]]'s correspondence from Rome relating to Augustine's mission</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Farmer_25/&gt;&lt;ref name=BEASE_Nothhelm&gt;Keynes, &quot;Nothhelm&quot;, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;335&amp;nbsp;336</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Almost all of Bede's information regarding Augustine is taken from these letters</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;  Bede acknowledged his correspondents in the preface to the ''Historia Ecclesiastica'';&lt;ref name=&quot;HE_pref&quot;&gt;Bede, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'', Preface, p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;42</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; he was in contact with [[Daniel of Winchester|Daniel]], the Bishop of Winchester, for information about the history of the church in Wessex, and also wrote to the monastery at [[Lastingham]] for information about [[Cedd]] and [[Chad of Mercia|Chad]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=HE_pref/&gt;  Bede also mentions an Abbot Esi as a source for the affairs of the East Anglian church, and Bishop [[Kinebertus|Cynibert]] for information about Lindsey</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=HE_pref/&gt;The historian [[Walter Goffart]] argues that Bede based the structure of the ''Historia'' on three works, using them as the framework around which the three main sections of the work were structured</span>
				<span class='text'>For the early part of the work, up until the Gregorian mission, Goffart feels that Bede used [[Gildas]]'s ''De excidio''</span>
				<span class='text'>The second section, detailing the [[Gregorian mission]] of [[Augustine of Canterbury]] was framed on the anonymous ''Life of Gregory the Great'' written at Whitby</span>
				<span class='text'>The last section, detailing events after the Gregorian mission, Goffart feels were modelled on [[Eddius|Stephen of Ripon]]'s ''Life of Wilfrid''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Goffart296&gt;{{harvnb|Goffart|1988| pp=296–307}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Bede's informants for information after Augustine's mission came from the eastern part of Britain, leaving significant gaps in the knowledge of the western areas, which were those areas likely to have a native Briton presence</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Deconstruct7&gt;{{harvnb|Brooks |2006|pp=7–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Deconstruct12&gt;{{harvnb|Brooks |2006|pp=12–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;=== Models and style ===Bede's stylistic models included some of the same authors from whom he drew the material for the earlier parts of his history</span>
				<span class='text'>His introduction imitates the work of Orosius,&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; and his title is an echo of Eusebius's ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=ASEEncBede/&gt;  Bede also followed Eusebius in taking the ''[[Acts of the Apostles]]'' as the model for the overall work: where Eusebius used the ''Acts'' as the theme for his description of the development of the church, Bede made it the model for his history of the Anglo-Saxon church</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Farmer_26&gt;{{harvnb|Farmer|1978|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bede quoted his sources at length in his narrative, as Eusebius had done</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; Bede also appears to have taken quotes directly from his correspondents at times</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, he almost always uses the terms &quot;Australes&quot; and &quot;Occidentales&quot; for the South and West Saxons respectively, but in a passage in the first book he uses &quot;Meridiani&quot; and &quot;Occidui&quot; instead, as perhaps his informant had done</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;  At the end of the work, Bede added a brief autobiographical note; this was an idea taken from [[Gregory of Tours]]' earlier ''History of the Franks''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Farmer_27&gt;{{harvnb|Farmer|1978|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;Bede's work as a [[hagiography|hagiographer]], and his detailed attention to dating, were both useful preparations for the task of writing the ''Historia Ecclesiastica''</span>
				<span class='text'>His interest in [[computus]], the science of calculating the date of Easter, was also useful in the account he gives of the controversy between the British and Anglo-Saxon church over the correct method of obtaining the Easter date</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Farmer_21 /&gt;Bede is described by [[Michael Lapidge]] as &quot;without question the most accomplished Latinist produced in these islands in the Anglo-Saxon period&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lapidge|2005|p=323}}&lt;/ref&gt; His Latin has been praised for its clarity, but his style in the ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' is not simple</span>
				<span class='text'> He knew rhetoric, and often used figures of speech and rhetorical forms which cannot easily be reproduced in translation, depending as they often do on the connotations of the Latin words</span>
				<span class='text'> However, unlike contemporaries such as [[Aldhelm]], whose Latin is full of difficulties, Bede's own text is easy to read</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=CM_xxxvii&gt;{{harvnb|Colgrave|Mynors|1969|pp=xxxvii–xxxviii}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the words of Charles Plummer, one of the best-known editors of the ''Historia Ecclesiastica'', Bede's Latin is &quot;clear and limpid&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>it is very seldom that we have to pause to think of the meaning of a sentence&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Alcuin rightly praises Bede for his unpretending style</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=Plummer_I_liii&gt;Plummer, ''Bedae Opera Historica'', vol</span>
				<span class='text'>I, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;liii–liv</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;=== Intent ===Bede's primary intention in writing the ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' was to show the growth of the united church throughout England</span>
				<span class='text'> The native Britons, whose Christian church survived the departure of the Romans, earn Bede's ire for refusing to help convert the Saxons; by the end of the ''Historia'' the English, and their Church, are dominant over the Britons</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=CM_xxx&gt;{{harvnb|Colgrave|Mynors|1969|pp=xxx–xxxi}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This goal, of showing the movement towards unity, explains Bede's animosity towards the British method of calculating Easter: much of the ''Historia'' is devoted to a history of the dispute, including the final resolution at the [[Synod of Whitby]] in 664</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Farmer_27/&gt;  Bede is also concerned to show the unity of the English, despite the disparate kingdoms that still existed when he was writing</span>
				<span class='text'> He also wants to instruct the reader by spiritual example, and to entertain, and to the latter end he adds stories about many of the places and people about which he wrote</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;CM_xxx&quot;/&gt;N</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Higham argues that Bede designed his work to promote his reform agenda to Ceolwulf, the Northumbrian king</span>
				<span class='text'>Bede painted a highly optimistic picture of the current situation in the Church, as opposed to the more pessimistic picture found in his private letters</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;ref&gt;N</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Higham, &quot;Bede's Agenda in Book IV of the ‘Ecclesiastical History of the English People’: A Tricky Matter of Advising the King,&quot; ''Journal of Ecclesiastical History'' (2013) 64#3 pp 476-493&lt;/ref&gt;Bede's extensive use of miracles can prove difficult for readers who consider him a more or less reliable historian, but do not accept the possibility of miracles</span>
				<span class='text'>et both reflect an inseparable integrity and regard for accuracy and truth, expressed in terms both of historical events and of a tradition of Christian faith that continues to the present day</span>
				<span class='text'>Bede, like Gregory the Great whom Bede quotes on the subject in the ''Historia'', felt that faith brought about by miracles was a stepping stone to a higher, truer faith, and that as a result miracles had their place in a work designed to instruct</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=CM_xxxiv&gt;{{harvnb|Colgrave|Mynors|1969|pp=xxxiv–xxxvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;=== Omissions and biases ===Bede is somewhat reticent about the career of [[Wilfrid]], a contemporary and one of the most prominent clerics of his day</span>
				<span class='text'> This may be because Wilfrid's opulent lifestyle was uncongenial to Bede's monastic mind; it may also be that the events of Wilfrid's life, divisive and controversial as they were, simply did not fit with Bede's theme of the progression to a unified and harmonious church</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Farmer_31/&gt;Bede's account of the early migrations of the Angles and Saxons to England omits any mention of a movement of those peoples across the channel from Britain to Brittany described by [[Procopius]], who was writing in the sixth century</span>
				<span class='text'> [[Frank Stenton]] describes this omission as &quot;a scholar's dislike of the indefinite&quot;; traditional material that could not be dated or used for Bede's didactic purposes had no interest for him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Stenton_8–9&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Stenton|1971|pp=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;Bede was a Northumbrian, and this tinged his work with a local bias</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=JMWH_xxxi&gt;{{harvnb|Wallace-Hadrill|1988|p=xxxi}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sources he had access to gave him less information about the west of England than for other areas</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=TCOB_119&gt;{{harvnb|Yorke|2006|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He says relatively little about the achievements of Mercia and Wessex, omitting, for example, any mention of [[Boniface]], a West Saxon missionary to the continent of some renown and of whom Bede had almost certainly heard, though Bede does discuss Northumbrian missionaries to the continent</span>
				<span class='text'> He also is parsimonious in his praise for [[Aldhelm]], a West Saxon who had done much to convert the native Britons to the Roman form of Christianity</span>
				<span class='text'> He lists seven kings of the Anglo-Saxons whom he regards as having held ''imperium'', or overlordship; only one king of Wessex, [[Ceawlin]], is listed, and none from Mercia, though elsewhere he acknowledges the secular power several of the Mercians held</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;TCOB_21–2&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Yorke|2006|pp=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Robin Fleming]] states that he was so hostile to Mercia because Northumbria had been diminished by Mercian power that he consulted no Mercian informants and included no stories about its saints</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fleming|2011|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;Bede relates the story of Augustine's mission from Rome, and tells how the British clergy refused to assist Augustine in the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons</span>
				<span class='text'> This, combined with Gildas's negative assessment of the British church at the time of the Anglo-Saxon invasions, led Bede to a very critical view of the native church</span>
				<span class='text'> However, Bede ignores the fact that at the time of Augustine's mission, the history between the two was one of warfare and conquest, which, in the words of [[Barbara Yorke]], would have naturally &quot;curbed any missionary impulses towards the Anglo-Saxons from the British clergy</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=TCOB_118&gt;{{harvnb|Yorke|2006|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;=== Use of ''Anno Domini'' ===At the time Bede wrote the ''Historia Ecclesiastica'', there were two common ways of referring to dates</span>
				<span class='text'> One was to use [[indiction]]s, which were 15-year cycles, counting from 312 AD</span>
				<span class='text'> There were three different varieties of indiction, each starting on a different day of the year</span>
				<span class='text'> The other approach was to use regnal years—the reigning Roman emperor, for example, or the ruler of whichever kingdom was under discussion</span>
				<span class='text'> This meant that in discussing conflicts between kingdoms, the date would have to be given in the regnal years of all the kings involved</span>
				<span class='text'> Bede used both these approaches on occasion, but adopted a third method as his main approach to dating: the ''[[anno domini]]'' method invented by [[Dionysius Exiguus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=CM_xviii&gt;{{harvnb|Colgrave|Mynors|1969|pp=xviii–xix}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Bede did not invent this method, his adoption of it, and his promulgation of it in ''De Temporum Ratione'', his work on chronology, is the main reason why it is now so widely used</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=CM_xviii/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stenton_186&gt;{{harvnb|Stenton|1971|p=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;=== Assessment ===The ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' was copied often in the Middle Ages, and about 160 manuscripts containing it survive</span>
				<span class='text'>About half of those are located on the European continent, rather than on the British Isles</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Companion4/&gt; Most of the 8th- and 9th-century texts of Bede's ''Historia'' come from the northern parts of the [[Carolingian]] Empire</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Reread21&gt;{{harvnb|Higham|2006|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This total does not include manuscripts with only a part of the work, of which another 100 or so survive</span>
				<span class='text'>It was printed for the first time between 1474 and 1482, probably at [[Strasbourg, France]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Companion4&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2008|pp=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern historians have studied the ''Historia'' extensively, and a number of editions have been produced</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Nar236/&gt; For many years, early Anglo-Saxon history was essentially a retelling of the ''Historia'', but recent scholarship has focused as much on what Bede did not write as what he did</span>
				<span class='text'>The belief that the ''Historia'' was the culmination of Bede's works, the aim of all his scholarship, a belief common among historians in the past, is no longer accepted by most scholars</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Nar238&gt;{{harvnb|Goffart |1988|pp= 238–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;Modern historians and editors of Bede have been lavish in their praise of his achievement in the ''Historia Ecclesiastica''</span>
				<span class='text'> Stenton regarded it as one of the &quot;small class of books which transcend all but the most fundamental conditions of time and place&quot;, and regarded its quality as dependent on Bede's &quot;astonishing power of co-ordinating the fragments of information which came to him through tradition, the relation of friends, or documentary evidence&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>In an age where little was attempted beyond the registration of fact, he had reached the conception of history</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name= Stenton_187&gt;{{harvnb|Stenton|1971|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patrick Wormald]] described him as &quot;the first and greatest of England's historians&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Worm29&gt;{{harvnb|Wormald|1999|p= 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;The ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' has given Bede a high reputation, but his concerns were different from those of a modern writer of history</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;  His focus on the history of the organisation of the English church, and on heresies and the efforts made to root them out, led him to exclude the secular history of kings and kingdoms except where a moral lesson could be drawn or where they illuminated events in the church</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; Besides the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', the medieval writers [[William of Malmesbury]], [[Henry of Huntingdon]], and [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] used his works as sources and inspirations</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Reread27&gt;{{harvnb|Higham|2006|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early modern writers, such as [[Polydore Vergil]] and [[Matthew Parker]], the Elizabethan Archbishop of Canterbury, also utilised the ''Historia'', and his works were used by both Protestant and Catholic sides in the Wars of Religion</span>

				<span class='text'>One historian, Charlotte Behr, thinks that the ''Historia's'' account of the arrival of the Germanic invaders in Kent should not be considered to relate what actually happened, but rather relates myths that were current in Kent during Bede's time</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Behr&gt;{{harvnb|Behr|2000|pp=25–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;It is likely that Bede's work, because it was so widely copied, discouraged others from writing histories and may even have led to the disappearance of manuscripts containing older historical works</span>

				<span class='text'>The majority of his writings were of this type, and covered the Old Testament and the New Testament</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=BedeVen42&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|1987|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was for his theological writings that he earned the title of ''Doctor Anglorum'', and why he was made a saint</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Theo&gt;{{harvnb|Ward |2001|pp=57–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;Bede synthesised and transmitted the learning from his predecessors, as well as made careful, judicious innovation in knowledge (such as recalculating the age of the earth—for which he was censured before surviving the heresy accusations and eventually having his views championed by Archbishop Ussher in the sixteenth century—see below) that had theological implications</span>
				<span class='text'>In order to do this, he learned Greek, and attempted to learn Hebrew</span>
				<span class='text'>He spent time reading and rereading both the Old and the New Testaments</span>
				<span class='text'>He mentions that he studied from a text of [[Jerome]]'s [[Vulgate]], which itself was from the Hebrew text</span>
				<span class='text'>He also studied both the Latin and the Greek Fathers of the Church</span>
				<span class='text'>In the monastic library at Jarrow were a number of books by theologians, including works by [[Basil of Caesarea|Basil]], [[John Cassian|Cassian]], [[John Chrysostom]], [[Isidore of Seville]], [[Origen]], [[Gregory of Nazianzus]], [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Jerome]], [[Pope Gregory I]], [[Ambrose of Milan]], [[Cassiodorus]], and [[Cyprian]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=CM_xxv/&gt;&lt;ref name=Theo/&gt; He used these, in conjunction with the Biblical texts themselves, to write his commentaries and other theological works</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Theo/&gt; He had a Latin translation by [[Evagrius of Antioch|Evagrius]] of [[Athanasius]]'s ''Life of Antony'', and a copy of [[Sulpicius Severus]]' ''Life of St</span>
				<span class='text'>Martin''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=CM_xxv/&gt;  He also used lesser known writers, such as [[Fulgentius of Ruspe|Fulgentius]], [[Julian of Eclanum]], [[Tyconius]], and [[Prosper of Aquitaine]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Bede was the first to refer to Jerome, Augustine, Pope Gregory and Ambrose as the four Latin [[Fathers of the Church]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Ward44&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|1990|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear from Bede's own comments that he felt his job was to explain to his students and readers the theology and thoughts of the Church Fathers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Mey827&gt;{{harvnb|Meyvaert|1996|p=827}}&lt;/ref&gt;Bede also wrote homilies, works written to explain theology used in worship services</span>
				<span class='text'>Bede wrote homilies not only on the major Christian seasons such as [[Advent]], [[Lent]], or Easter, but on other subjects such as anniversaries of significant events</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Theo/&gt;Both types of Bede's theological works circulated widely in the Middle Ages</span>
				<span class='text'>A number of his biblical commentaries were incorporated into the ''[[Glossa Ordinaria]]'', an 11th-century collection of biblical commentaries</span>
				<span class='text'>Some of Bede's homilies were collected by [[Paul the Deacon]], and they were used in that form in the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Monastic Office]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Saint Boniface]] used Bede's homilies in his missionary efforts on the continent</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Theo/&gt;Bede sometimes included in his theological books an acknowledgement of the predecessors on whose works he drew</span>
				<span class='text'> In two cases he left instructions that his marginal notes, which gave the details of his sources, should be preserved by the copyist, and he may have originally added marginal comments about his sources to others of his works</span>
				<span class='text'> Where he does not specify, it is still possible to identify books to which he must have had access by quotations that he uses</span>
				<span class='text'> A full catalogue of the library available to Bede in the monastery cannot be reconstructed, but it is possible to tell, for example, that Bede was very familiar with the works of Virgil</span>
				<span class='text'> There is little evidence that he had access to any other of the pagan Latin writers—he quotes many of these writers but the quotes are almost all to be found in the Latin grammars that were common in his day, one or more of which would certainly have been at the monastery</span>
				<span class='text'> Another difficulty is that manuscripts of early writers were often incomplete: it is apparent that Bede had access to Pliny's ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Encyclopedia]]'', for example, but it seems that the version he had was missing book xviii, as he would almost certainly have quoted from it in his ''De temporum ratione''</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=BedeVen36&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|1987|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His works were so influential that late in the 9th century [[Notker the Stammerer]], a monk of the [[Abbey of St</span>
				<span class='text'>Gall|Monastery of St</span>
				<span class='text'>Gall]] in Switzerland, wrote that &quot;God, the orderer of natures, who raised the Sun from the East on the fourth day of Creation, in the sixth day of the world has made Bede rise from the West as a new Sun to illuminate the whole Earth&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bede2004plxxxv&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bede|2004|p=lxxxv}}&lt;/ref&gt;== Educational works ==Bede wrote some works designed to help teach grammar in the abbey school</span>
				<span class='text'>One of these was his ''De arte metrica'', a discussion of the composition of Latin verse, drawing on previous grammarians work</span>
				<span class='text'>It was based on Donatus' ''De pedibus'' and [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]]' ''De finalibus'', and used examples from Christian poets as well as Virgil</span>
				<span class='text'>It became a standard text for the teaching of Latin verse during the next few centuries</span>
				<span class='text'>Bede dedicated this work to Cuthbert, apparently a student, for he is named &quot;beloved son&quot; in the dedication, and Bede says &quot;I have laboured to educate you in divine letters and ecclesiastical statutes&quot;&lt;ref name=BedeVen31&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|1987|pp=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another textbook of Bede's is the ''De orthographia'', a work on [[orthography]], designed to help a medieval reader of Latin with unfamiliar abbreviations and words from classical Latin works</span>
				<span class='text'>Although it could serve as a textbook, it appears to have been mainly intended as a reference work</span>
				<span class='text'>The exact date of composition for both of these works is unknown</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=BedeVen35&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|1987|pp=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;Another educational work is ''De schematibus et tropis sacrae scripturae'', which discusses the Bible's use of rhetoric</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;  Bede was familiar with pagan authors such as Virgil, but it was not considered appropriate to teach biblical grammar from such texts, and in ''De schematibus&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>' Bede argues for the superiority of Christian texts in understanding Christian literature</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;&lt;ref name=CM_xxvi&gt;Colgrave gives the example of [[Desiderius of Vienne]], who was reprimanded by Gregory the Great for using &quot;heathen&quot; authors in his teaching</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, his text on poetic metre uses only Christian poetry for examples</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;== Vernacular poetry ==According to his disciple Cuthbert, Bede was also ''doctus in nostris carminibus'' (&quot;learned in our songs&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>Cuthbert's letter on Bede's death, the ''Epistola Cuthberti de obitu Bedae'', moreover, commonly is understood to indicate that Bede also composed a five line vernacular poem known to modern scholars as ''Bede's Death Song'': And he used to repeat that sentence from [[Paul of Tarsus|St</span>
				<span class='text'>Paul]] &quot;It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God,&quot; and many other verses of Scripture, urging us thereby to awake from the slumber of the soul by thinking in good time of our last hour</span>
				<span class='text'>And in our own language,—for he was familiar with English poetry,—speaking of the soul's dread departure from the body:{| cellpadding=&quot;10&quot; style=&quot;margin:auto;&quot;|-| Facing that enforced journey, no man can be &lt;br /&gt;More prudent than he has good call to be, &lt;br /&gt;If he consider, before his going hence, &lt;br /&gt;What for his spirit of good hap or of evil &lt;br /&gt;After his day of death shall be determined</span>

				<span class='text'>The fact that Cuthbert's description places the performance of the Old English poem in the context of a series of quoted passages from Sacred Scripture, indeed, might be taken as evidence simply that Bede also cited analogous vernacular texts</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Opland140&gt;{{harvnb|Opland|1980|pp=140–141}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the inclusion of the Old English text of the poem in Cuthbert's Latin letter, the observation that Bede &quot;was learned in our song,&quot; and the fact that Bede composed a Latin poem on the same subject all point to the possibility of his having written it</span>
				<span class='text'>By citing the poem directly, Cuthbert seems to imply that its particular wording was somehow important, either since it was a vernacular poem endorsed by a scholar who evidently frowned upon secular entertainment&lt;ref name=Mccready14&gt;{{harvnb|McCready|1994|pp=14–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; or because it is a direct quotation of Bede's last original composition</span>
