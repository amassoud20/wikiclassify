				<span class='text'> His Latin has been praised for its clarity but his style in the Historia Ecclesiastica is not simple</span>

				<span class='text'> This may be because Wilfrids opulent lifestyle was uncongenial to Bedes monastic mind it may also be that the events of Wilfrids life divisive and controversial as they were simply did not fit with Bedes theme of the progression to a unified and harmonious church</span>

				<span class='text'>name Stenton 8–9 Bede was a Northumbrian and this tinged his work with a local bias</span>
				<span class='text'>name JMWH xxxi   The sources he had access to gave him less information about the west of England than for other areas</span>
				<span class='text'>name TCOB 119   He says relatively little about the achievements of Mercia and Wessex omitting for example any mention of  a West Saxon missionary to the continent of some renown and of whom Bede had almost certainly heard though Bede does discuss Northumbrian missionaries to the continent</span>
				<span class='text'> He also is parsimonious in his praise for  a West Saxon who had done much to convert the native Britons to the Roman form of Christianity</span>
				<span class='text'> He lists seven kings of the Anglo Saxons whom he regards as having held imperium or overlordship only one king of Wessex  is listed and none from Mercia though elsewhere he acknowledges the secular power several of the Mercians held</span>
				<span class='text'>name TCOB 21–2  Historian  states that he was so hostile to Mercia because Northumbria had been diminished by Mercian power that he consulted no Mercian informants and included no stories about its saints</span>
				<span class='text'>Bede relates the story of Augustines mission from Rome and tells how the British clergy used to assist Augustine in the conversion of the Anglo Saxons</span>
				<span class='text'> This combined with Gildass negative assessment of the British church at the time of the Anglo Saxon invasions led Bede to a very critical view of the native church</span>
				<span class='text'> However Bede ignores the fact that at the time of Augustines mission the history between the two was one of warfare and conquest which in the words of  would have naturally curbed any missionary impulses towards the Anglo Saxons from the British clergy</span>
				<span class='text'>name TCOB 118 At the time Bede wrote the Historia Ecclesiastica there were two common ways of erring to dates</span>
				<span class='text'> One was to use s which were 15 year cycles counting from 312 AD</span>
				<span class='text'> There were three different varieties of indiction each starting on a different day of the year</span>
				<span class='text'> The other approach was to use regnal years—the reigning Roman emperor for example or the ruler of whichever kingdom was under discussion</span>
				<span class='text'> This meant that in discussing conflicts between kingdoms the date would have to be given in the regnal years of all the kings involved</span>
				<span class='text'> Bede used both these approaches on occasion but adopted a third method as his main approach to dating the  method invented by </span>
				<span class='text'>name CM xviii   Although Bede did not invent this method his adoption of it and his promulgation of it in De Temporum Ratione his work on chronology is the main reason why it is now so widely used</span>
				<span class='text'>name CM xviii  name Stenton 186 The Historia Ecclesiastica was copied often in the Middle Ages and about 160 manuscripts containing it survive</span>
				<span class='text'>About half of those are located on the European continent rather than on the British Isles</span>
				<span class='text'>name Companion4  Most of the 8th  and 9th century texts of Bedes Historia come from the northern parts of the  Empire</span>
				<span class='text'>name Reread21  This total does not include manuscripts with only a part of the work of which another 100 or so survive</span>
				<span class='text'>It was printed for the first time between 1474 and 1482 probably at </span>
				<span class='text'>name Companion4  Modern historians have studied the Historia extensively and a number of editions have been produced</span>
				<span class='text'>name Nar236  For many years early Anglo Saxon history was essentially a retelling of the Historia but recent scholarship has focused as much on what Bede did not write as what he did</span>
				<span class='text'>The belief that the Historia was the culmination of Bedes works the aim of all his scholarship a belief common among historians in the past is no longer accepted by most scholars</span>
				<span class='text'>name Nar238 Modern historians and editors of Bede have been lavish in their praise of his achievement in the Historia Ecclesiastica</span>
				<span class='text'> Stenton regarded it as one of the small class of books which transcend all but the most fundamental conditions of time and place and regarded its quality as dependent on Bedes astonishing power of co ordinating the fragments of information which came to him through tradition the relation of friends or documentary evidenceampnbsp</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>In an age where little was attempted beyond the registration of fact he had reached the conception of history</span>
				<span class='text'>name  Stenton 187   described him as the first and greatest of Englands historians</span>
				<span class='text'>name Worm29 The Historia Ecclesiastica has given Bede a high reputation but his concerns were different from those of a modern writer of history</span>
				<span class='text'>name ODNB   His focus on the history of the organisation of the English church and on heresies and the efforts made to root them out led him to exclude the secular history of kings and kingdoms except where a moral lesson could be drawn or where they illuminated events in the church</span>
				<span class='text'>name ODNB  Besides the  the medieval writers   and  used his works as sources and inspirations</span>
				<span class='text'>name Reread27  Early modern writers such as  and  the Elizabethan Archbishop of Canterbury also utilised the Historia and his works were used by both Protestant and Catholic sides in the Wars of Religion</span>
				<span class='text'>name Reread33 Some historians have questioned the reliability of some of Bedes accounts</span>
				<span class='text'>One historian Charlotte Behr thinks that the Historias account of the arrival of the Germanic invaders in Kent should not be considered to relate what actually happened but rather relates myths that were current in Kent during Bedes time</span>
				<span class='text'>name Behr It is likely that Bedes work because it was so widely copied discouraged others from writing histories and may even have led to the disappearance of manuscripts containing older historical works</span>

				<span class='text'> Other historical works As Chapter 66 of his On the Reckoning of Time in 725 Bede wrote the Greater Chronicle chronica maiora which sometimes circulated as a separate work</span>
				<span class='text'>For recent events the Chronicle like his Ecclesiastical History relied upon Gildas upon a version of the  current at least to the papacy of  687–701 and other sources</span>
				<span class='text'>For earlier events he drew on s Chronikoi Kanones</span>

				<span class='text'>He also created a listing of saints the Martyrology</span>
				<span class='text'>name Goffart245  Theological works In his own time Bede was as well known for his biblical commentaries and exegetical as well as other theological works</span>
				<span class='text'>The majority of his writings were of this type and covered the Old Testament and the New Testament</span>
				<span class='text'>Most survived the Middle Ages but a few were lost</span>
				<span class='text'>name BedeVen42  It was for his theological writings that he earned the title of Doctor Anglorum and why he was made a saint</span>
				<span class='text'>name Theo Bede synthesised and transmitted the learning from his predecessors as well as made caul judicious innovation in knowledge such as recalculating the age of the earth—for which he was censured before surviving the heresy accusations and eventually having his views championed by Archbishop Ussher in the sixteenth century—see below that had theological implications</span>
				<span class='text'>In order to do this he learned Greek and attempted to learn Hebrew</span>
				<span class='text'>He spent time reading and rereading both the Old and the New Testaments</span>
				<span class='text'>He mentions that he studied from a text of s  which itself was from the Hebrew text</span>
				<span class='text'>He also studied both the Latin and the Greek Fathers of the Church</span>
				<span class='text'>In the monastic library at Jarrow were a number of books by theologians including works by            and </span>
				<span class='text'>name CM xxv  name Theo  He used these in conjunction with the Biblical texts themselves to write his commentaries and other theological works</span>
				<span class='text'>name Theo  He had a Latin translation by  of s Life of Antony and a copy of  Life of St</span>
				<span class='text'>Martin</span>
				<span class='text'>name CM xxv   He also used lesser known writers such as    and </span>

				<span class='text'>name Ward44  It is clear from Bedes own comments that he felt his job was to explain to his students and readers the theology and thoughts of the Church Fathers</span>
				<span class='text'>name Mey827 Bede also wrote homilies works written to explain theology used in worship services</span>
				<span class='text'>Bede wrote homilies not only on the major Christian seasons such as   or Easter but on other subjects such as anniversaries of significant events</span>
				<span class='text'>name Theo Both types of Bedes theological works circulated widely in the Middle Ages</span>
				<span class='text'>A number of his biblical commentaries were incorporated into the  an 11th century collection of biblical commentaries</span>
				<span class='text'>Some of Bedes homilies were collected by  and they were used in that form in the </span>
				<span class='text'> used Bedes homilies in his missionary efforts on the continent</span>
				<span class='text'>name Theo Bede sometimes included in his theological books an acknowledgement of the predecessors on whose works he drew</span>
				<span class='text'> In two cases he left instructions that his marginal notes which gave the details of his sources should be preserved by the copyist and he may have originally added marginal comments about his sources to others of his works</span>
				<span class='text'> Where he does not specify it is still possible to identify books to which he must have had access by quotations that he uses</span>
				<span class='text'> A full catalogue of the library available to Bede in the monastery cannot be reconstructed but it is possible to tell for example that Bede was very familiar with the works of Virgil</span>
				<span class='text'> There is little evidence that he had access to any other of the pagan Latin writers—he quotes many of these writers but the quotes are almost all to be found in the Latin grammars that were common in his day one or more of which would certainly have been at the monastery</span>
				<span class='text'> Another difficulty is that manuscripts of early writers were often incomplete it is apparent that Bede had access to Plinys  for example but it seems that the version he had was missing book xviii as he would almost certainly have quoted from it in his De temporum ratione</span>

				<span class='text'>One of these was his De arte metrica a discussion of the composition of Latin verse drawing on previous grammarians work</span>
				<span class='text'>It was based on Donatus De pedibus and  De finalibus and used examples from Christian poets as well as Virgil</span>
				<span class='text'>It became a standard text for the teaching of Latin verse during the next few centuries</span>

				<span class='text'>Although it could serve as a textbook it appears to have been mainly intended as a erence work</span>
				<span class='text'>The exact date of composition for both of these works is unknown</span>
				<span class='text'>name BedeVen35 Another educational work is De schematibus et tropis sacrae scripturae which discusses the Bibles use of rhetoric</span>
				<span class='text'>name ODNB   Bede was familiar with pagan authors such as Virgil but it was not considered appropriate to teach biblical grammar from such texts and in De schematibusampnbsp</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Bede argues for the superiority of Christian texts in understanding Christian literature</span>
				<span class='text'>name ODNB  name CM xxviColgrave gives the example of  who was reprimanded by Gregory the Great for using heathen authors in his teaching</span>
				<span class='text'>  Similarly his text on poetic metre uses only Christian poetry for examples</span>
				<span class='text'>name ODNB  Vernacular poetry According to his disciple Cuthbert Bede was also doctus in nostris carminibus learned in our songs</span>
				<span class='text'>Cuthberts letter on Bedes death the Epistola Cuthberti de obitu Bedae moreover commonly is understood to indicate that Bede also composed a five line vernacular poem known to modern scholars as Bedes Death Song And he used to repeat that sentence from  It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God and many other verses of Scripture urging us thereby to awake from the slumber of the soul by thinking in good time of our last hour</span>

				<span class='text'>name ColgraveMynors1969pp580 3  }As Opland notes however it is not entirely clear that Cuthbert is attributing this text to Bede most manuscripts of the letter do not use a  to describe Bedes presentation of the song and the theme was relatively common in Old English and Anglo Latin literature</span>
				<span class='text'>The fact that Cuthberts description places the performance of the Old English poem in the context of a series of quoted passages from Sacred Scripture indeed might be taken as evidence simply that Bede also cited analogous vernacular texts</span>
				<span class='text'>name Opland140  On the other hand the inclusion of the Old English text of the poem in Cuthberts Latin letter the observation that Bede was learned in our song and the fact that Bede composed a Latin poem on the same subject all point to the possibility of his having written it</span>
				<span class='text'>By citing the poem directly Cuthbert seems to imply that its particular wording was somehow important either since it was a vernacular poem endorsed by a scholar who evidently frowned upon secular entertainment name Mccready14  or because it is a direct quotation of Bedes last original composition</span>
				<span class='text'>name Opland14  Veneration There is no evidence for cult being paid to Bede in England in the 8th century</span>
