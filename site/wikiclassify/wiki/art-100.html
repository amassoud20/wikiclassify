				<span class='text'> His breakthrough occurred in 1796 when he showed that a regular  can be constructed by  if and only if the number of sides is the product of distinct  s  and a  of 2</span>
				<span class='text'>This was a major discovery in an important field of mathematics construction problems had occupied mathematicians since the days of the  and the discovery ultimately led Gauss to choose mathematics instead of  as a career</span>
				<span class='text'>auss was so pleased by this result that he requested that a regular  be inscribed on his tombstone</span>

				<span class='text'> He further advanced  greatly simplifying manipulations in number theory</span>
				<span class='text'>On 8 April he became the first to prove the  law</span>
				<span class='text'>This remarkably general law allows mathematicians to determine the solvability of any quadratic equation in modular arithmetic</span>
				<span class='text'>The  conjectured on 31ampnbspMay gives a good understanding of how the s are distributed among the integers</span>

				<span class='text'>Piazzi could only track Ceres for somewhat more than a month following it for three degrees across the night sky</span>
				<span class='text'>Then it disappeared temporarily behind the glare of the Sun</span>
				<span class='text'>Several months later when Ceres should have reappeared Piazzi could not locate it the mathematical tools of the time were not able to extrapolate a position from such a scant amount of data—three degrees represent less than 1% of the total orbit</span>
				<span class='text'>auss who was 24 at the time heard about the problem and tackled it</span>
				<span class='text'>After three months of intense work he predicted a position for Ceres in December 1801—just about a year after its first sighting—and this turned out to be accurate within a half degree when it was rediscovered by  on 31 December at  and one day later by  in </span>
				<span class='text'>involved determining a  in space given one focus the Sun and the conics intersection with three given lines lines of sight from the Earth which is itself moving on an ellipse to the planet and given the time it takes the planet to traverse the arcs determined by these lines from which the lengths of the arcs can be calculated by </span>
				<span class='text'>This problem leads to an equation of the eighth degree of which one solution the Earths orbit is known</span>
				<span class='text'>The solution sought is then separated from the remaining six based on physical conditions</span>
				<span class='text'>In this work Gauss used comprehensive approximation methods which he created for that purpose</span>
				<span class='text'>One such method was the </span>
				<span class='text'>While this method is traditionally attributed to a 1965 paper by  and   Gauss developed it as a trigonometric interpolation method</span>

				<span class='text'>This paper predates the first presentation by  on the subject in 1807</span>
				<span class='text'>Zach noted that without the intelligent work and calculations of Doctor Gauss we might not have found Ceres again</span>
				<span class='text'>Though Gauss had up to that point been financially supported by his stipend from the Duke he doubted the security of this arrangement and also did not believe pure mathematics to be important enough to deserve support</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus he sought a position in astronomy and in 1807 was appointed Professor of Astronomy and Director of the astronomical  a post he held for the remainder of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>he discovery of Ceres led Gauss to his work on a theory of the motion of planetoids disturbed by large planets eventually published in 1809 as Theoria motus corporum coelestium in sectionibus conicis solem ambientum Theory of motion of the celestial bodies moving in conic sections around the Sun</span>
				<span class='text'>In the process he so streamlined the cumbersome mathematics of 18th century orbital prediction that his work remains a cornerstone of astronomical computation</span>
				<span class='text'>It introduced the  and contained an influential treatment of the  a procedure used in all sciences to this day to minimize the impact of </span>
				<span class='text'>Gauss proved the method under the assumption of  errors see  see also </span>
				<span class='text'>The method had been described earlier by  in 1805 but Gauss claimed that he had been using it since 1795</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1818 Gauss putting his calculation skills to practical use carried out a  of the  linking up with previous  surveys</span>
				<span class='text'>To aid the survey Gauss invented the  an instrument that uses a mirror to lect sunlight over great distances to measure positions</span>
				<span class='text'>auss also claimed to have discovered the possibility of  but never published it</span>
				<span class='text'>This discovery was a major paradigm shift in mathematics as it freed mathematicians from the mistaken belief that Euclids axioms were the only way to make geometry consistent and non contradictory</span>
				<span class='text'>esearch on these geometries led to among other things s theory of general relativity which describes the universe as non Euclidean</span>
				<span class='text'>His friend  with whom Gauss had sworn brotherhood and the banner of truth as a student had tried in vain for many years to prove the parallel postulate from Euclids other axioms of geometry</span>
				<span class='text'>Bolyais son  discovered non Euclidean geometry in 1829 his work was published in 1832</span>
				<span class='text'>After seeing it Gauss wrote to Farkas Bolyai To praise it would amount to praising myself</span>
				<span class='text'>For the entire content of the workampnbsp</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>coincides almost exactly with my own meditations which have occupied my mind for the past thirty or thirty five years</span>
				<span class='text'>This unproved statement put a strain on his relationship with János Bolyai who thought that Gauss was stealing his idea name Krantz2010   but it is now generally taken at face value</span>
				<span class='text'>etters from Gauss years before 1829 reveal him obscurely discussing the problem of parallel lines</span>
				<span class='text'> a biographer of Gauss argues in Gauss Titan of Science that Gauss was in fact in full possession of non Euclidean geometry long before it was published by  but that he used to publish any of it because of his fear of controversy</span>
