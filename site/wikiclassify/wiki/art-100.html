				<span class='text'>When he was eight, he figured out how to add up all the numbers from 1 to 100</span>

				<span class='text'>In The Hutchinson Dictionary of scientific biography</span>
				<span class='text'>Abington, United Kingdom: Helicon</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt; There are also many other anecdotes about his precocity while a toddler, and he made his first ground-breaking mathematical discoveries while still a teenager</span>
				<span class='text'>He completed ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'', his [[magnum opus]], in 1798 at the age of 21, though it was not published until 1801</span>
				<span class='text'>This work was fundamental in consolidating number theory as a discipline and has shaped the field to the present day</span>
				<span class='text'>auss's intellectual abilities attracted the attention of the [[Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick|Duke of Brunswick]],&lt;ref name=&quot;scientificmonthly&quot;/&gt; who sent him to the Collegium Carolinum (now [[Braunschweig University of Technology]]), which he attended from 1792 to 1795, and to the [[Georg-August University of Göttingen|University of Göttingen]] from 1795 to 1798</span>
				<span class='text'>hile at university, Gauss independently rediscovered several important theorems</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Gauss}}&lt;/ref&gt; His breakthrough occurred in 1796 when he showed that a regular [[polygon]] can be constructed by [[Compass and straightedge constructions|compass and straightedge]] if and only if the number of sides is the product of distinct  [[Fermat number|Fermat prime]]s  and a [[exponentiation|power]] of 2</span>
				<span class='text'>This was a major discovery in an important field of mathematics; construction problems had occupied mathematicians since the days of the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]], and the discovery ultimately led Gauss to choose mathematics instead of [[philology]] as a career</span>
				<span class='text'>auss was so pleased by this result that he requested that a regular [[heptadecagon]] be inscribed on his tombstone</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[stone masonry|stonemason]] declined, stating that the difficult construction would essentially look like a circle</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pappas, Theoni: Mathematical Snippets, Page 42</span>
				<span class='text'>Pgw 2008&lt;/ref&gt;The year 1796 was most productive for both Gauss and number theory</span>
				<span class='text'>He discovered a construction of the heptadecagon on 30 March</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Carl Friedrich Gauss §§365–366 in [[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Leipzig, Germany, 1801</span>
				<span class='text'>New Haven, CT: [[Yale University Press]], 1965</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He further advanced [[modular arithmetic]], greatly simplifying manipulations in number theory</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} On 8 April he became the first to prove the [[quadratic reciprocity]] law</span>
				<span class='text'>This remarkably general law allows mathematicians to determine the solvability of any quadratic equation in modular arithmetic</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[prime number theorem]], conjectured on 31&amp;nbsp;May, gives a good understanding of how the [[prime number]]s are distributed among the integers</span>
				<span class='text'>auss also discovered that every positive integer is representable as a sum of at most three [[triangular number]]s on 10 July and then jotted down in [[Gauss's diary|his diary]] the note: &quot;[[Eureka (word)|ΕΥΡΗΚΑ]]! num&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;Δ&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;Δ&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;Δ&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>On October&amp;nbsp;1 he published a result on the number of solutions of polynomials with coefficients in [[finite field]]s, which 150 years later led to the [[Weil conjectures]]</span>
				<span class='text'>= Middle years =={{refimprove section|date=July 2012}}===Algebra===[[File:Disqvisitiones-800</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Title page of Gauss's ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'']]In his 1799 doctorate in absentia, ''A new proof of the theorem that every integral rational algebraic function of one variable can be resolved into real factors of the first or second degree'', Gauss proved the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] which states that every non-constant single-variable [[polynomial]] with complex coefficients has at least one complex [[root of a function|root]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Mathematicians including [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] had produced false proofs before him, and Gauss's dissertation contains a critique of d'Alembert's work</span>
				<span class='text'>Ironically, by today's standard, Gauss's own attempt is not acceptable, owing to implicit use of the [[Jordan curve theorem]]</span>
				<span class='text'>However, he subsequently produced three other proofs, the last one in 1849 being generally rigorous</span>
				<span class='text'>His attempts clarified the concept of complex numbers considerably along the way</span>
				<span class='text'>auss also made important contributions to [[number theory]] with his 1801 book ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'' ([[Latin]], Arithmetical Investigations), which, among other things, introduced the symbol ≡ for congruence and used it in a clean presentation of [[modular arithmetic]], contained the first two proofs of the law of [[quadratic reciprocity]], developed the theories of binary and ternary [[quadratic form]]s, stated the [[class number problem]] for them, and showed that a regular [[heptadecagon]] (17-sided polygon) can be [[Compass and straightedge constructions|constructed with straightedge and compass]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==Astronomy===[[File:Bendixen - Carl Friedrich Gauß, 1828</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Gauss's portrait published in ''[[Astronomische Nachrichten]]'' 1828]]In that same year, [[Italy|Italian]] astronomer [[Giuseppe Piazzi]] discovered the [[dwarf planet]] [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Piazzi could only track Ceres for somewhat more than a month, following it for three degrees across the night sky</span>
				<span class='text'>Then it disappeared temporarily behind the glare of the Sun</span>
				<span class='text'>Several months later, when Ceres should have reappeared, Piazzi could not locate it: the mathematical tools of the time were not able to extrapolate a position from such a scant amount of data—three degrees represent less than 1% of the total orbit</span>
				<span class='text'>auss, who was 24 at the time, heard about the problem and tackled it</span>
				<span class='text'>After three months of intense work, he predicted a position for Ceres in December 1801—just about a year after its first sighting—and this turned out to be accurate within a half-degree when it was rediscovered by [[Franz Xaver von Zach]] on 31 December at [[Gotha Observatory|Gotha]], and one day later by [[Heinrich Wilhelm Matthäus Olbers|Heinrich Olbers]] in [[Bremen]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[Gauss' Method|Gauss's method]] involved determining a [[conic section]] in space, given one focus (the Sun) and the conic's intersection with three given lines (lines of sight from the Earth, which is itself moving on an ellipse, to the planet) and given the time it takes the planet to traverse the arcs determined by these lines (from which the lengths of the arcs can be calculated by [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Kepler's Second Law]])</span>
				<span class='text'>This problem leads to an equation of the eighth degree, of which one solution, the Earth's orbit, is known</span>
				<span class='text'>The solution sought is then separated from the remaining six based on physical conditions</span>
				<span class='text'>In this work Gauss used comprehensive approximation methods which he created for that purpose</span>

				<span class='text'>Though Gauss had up to that point been financially supported by his stipend from the Duke, he doubted the security of this arrangement, and also did not believe pure mathematics to be important enough to deserve support</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus he sought a position in astronomy, and in 1807 was appointed Professor of Astronomy and Director of the astronomical [[Göttingen Observatory|observatory in Göttingen]], a post he held for the remainder of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>he discovery of Ceres led Gauss to his work on a theory of the motion of planetoids disturbed by large planets, eventually published in 1809 as ''Theoria motus corporum coelestium in sectionibus conicis solem ambientum'' (Theory of motion of the celestial bodies moving in conic sections around the Sun)</span>
				<span class='text'>In the process, he so streamlined the cumbersome mathematics of 18th century orbital prediction that his work remains a cornerstone of astronomical computation</span>

				<span class='text'>== Non-Euclidean geometries===Gauss also claimed to have discovered the possibility of [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean geometries]] but never published it</span>
				<span class='text'>This discovery was a major paradigm shift in mathematics, as it freed mathematicians from the mistaken belief that Euclid's axioms were the only way to make geometry consistent and non-contradictory</span>

				<span class='text'>Waldo Dunnington]] describes Gauss's religious views in these terms:&lt;blockquote&gt;For him science was the means of exposing the immortal nucleus of the human soul</span>
				<span class='text'>In the days of his full strength it furnished him recreation and, by the prospects which it opened up to him, gave consolation</span>
				<span class='text'>Toward the end of his life it brought him confidence</span>
				<span class='text'>Gauss' God was not a cold and distant figment of metaphysics, nor a distorted caricature of embittered theology</span>
				<span class='text'>To man is not vouchsafed that fullness of knowledge which would warrant his arrogantly holding that his blurred vision is the full light and that there can be none other which might report truth as does his</span>
				<span class='text'>For Gauss, not he who mumbles his creed, but he who lives it, is accepted</span>
				<span class='text'>He believed that a life worthily spent here on earth is the best, the only, preparation for heaven</span>
				<span class='text'>Religion is not a question of literature, but of life</span>
				<span class='text'>God's revelation is continuous, not contained in tablets of stone or sacred parchment</span>
				<span class='text'>A book is inspired when it inspires</span>
				<span class='text'>The unshakeable idea of personal continuance after death, the firm belief in a last regulator of things, in an eternal, just, omniscient, omnipotent God, formed the basis of his religious life, which harmonized completely with his scientific research</span>

				<span class='text'>298-301&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Apart from his correspondence, there are not many known details about Gauss' personal creed</span>
				<span class='text'>Many biographers of Gauss disagree with his religious stance, with Bühler and others considering him a [[deism|deist]] with very unorthodox views,&lt;ref name=Buhler3/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gerhard Falk 1995 121&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=American Judaism in Transition: The Secularization of a Religious Community|year=1995|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=978-0-7618-0016-3|author=Gerhard Falk|page=121|quote=Gauss told his friend Rudolf Wagner, a professor of biology at Gottingen University, that he did not fully believe in the Bible but that he had meditated a great deal on the future of the human soul and speculated on the possibility of the soul being reincarnated on another planet</span>
				<span class='text'>Evidently, Gauss was a Deist with a good deal of skepticism concerning religion but incorporating a great deal of philosophical interests in the Big Questions, that is</span>

				<span class='text'>Despite his religious beliefs</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite his strong roots in the Enlightenment, Gauss was not an atheist, rather a [[deism|deist]] with very unorthodox convictions, unorthodox even if measured against the very liberal persuasions of the contemporary Protestant church</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt; while Dunnington (though admitting that Gauss did not believe literally in all Christian dogmas and that it is unknown what he believed on most doctrinal and confessional questions) points out that he was, at least, a nominal [[Lutheran]]</span>

				<span class='text'>This tolerance is not to be confused with religious indifference</span>
				<span class='text'>He took special interest in the religious development of the human race, especially in his own century</span>
				<span class='text'>With reference to the manifold denominations, which frequently did not agree with his views, he always emphasized that one is not justified in disturbing the faith of others in which they find consolation for earthly sufferings and a safe refuge in days of misfortune&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;In connection to this, there's a record of a conversation between [[Rudolf Wagner]] and Gauss, in which they discussed [[William Whewell]]'s book ''Of the Plurality of Worlds''</span>
				<span class='text'>In this work, Whewell had discarded the possibility of existing life in other planets, on the basis of theological arguments, but this was a position with which both Wagner and Gauss disagreed</span>
				<span class='text'>Later Wagner explained that he did not fully believe in the [[Bible]], though he confessed that he &quot;envied&quot; those who were able to easily believe</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; This later led them to discuss the topic of [[faith]], and in some other religious remarks, Gauss said that he had been more influenced by theologians like Lutheran minister [[Paul Gerhardt]] than by [[Moses]]</span>
