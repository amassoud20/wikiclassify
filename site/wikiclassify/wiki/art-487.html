				<span class='text'>She became acquainted with regional country singer Mary Bailey who had had some country chart success in 1976</span>

				<span class='text'>She also demo-ed songs with Cyril Rawson but the demos were without success, partly due to Twain's wish to become a rock singer, not a country artist</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Eggar 2005 p=92&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Eggar|2005|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;There she met rock keyboardist Eric Lambier and drummer Randy Yurko and formed a new band, moving three months later to [[Bowmanville]], near Toronto</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Eggar 2005 p=92&quot; /&gt; In the fall of 1986 Twain continued to express her desire to be a pop or rock singer rather than country, which led to her falling out with Mary Bailey for two years</span>

				<span class='text'>Her performance received little acclaim, but it convinced Bell, who hated pop music, that Twain should stay well away from it and concentrate on country music</span>
