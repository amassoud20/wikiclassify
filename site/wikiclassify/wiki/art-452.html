				<span class='text'>]'''Robert Fulton''' (November 14, 1765 – February 24, 1815) was an [[United States|American]] [[engineer]] and [[inventor]] who is widely credited with developing a commercially successful [[steamboat]] called ''Clermont''</span>
				<span class='text'>That steamboat went with passengers from New York City to Albany and back again, a round trip of 300 miles, in 62 hours</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1800, he was commissioned by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] to design the ''&quot;[[Nautilus (1800 submarine)|Nautilus]]&quot;'', which was the first practical [[submarine]] in history</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Fulton became interested in [[steam engines]] and using them on [[steamboats]] in 1777 when he was around age 12 and visited state delegate [[William Henry (delegate)|William Henry]] of [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]], who himself had earlier learned about inventor [[James Watt]], (1736-1819), and his [[Watt steam engine]] on a visit to [[England]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Early life==Robert Fulton was born on a farm in [[Little Britain Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Little Britain, Pennsylvania]], on November 14, 1765</span>
				<span class='text'>He had at least three sisters – Isabella, Elizabeth, and Mary, and a younger brother, Abraham</span>
				<span class='text'>He then married Harriet Livingston and had four children, Julia, Mary, Cornelia, and Robert</span>
				<span class='text'>His father, Robert, had been a close friend to the father of painter [[Benjamin West]], (1738-1820)</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|A drawing of Fulton's invention ''&quot;[[Nautilus (1800 submarine)|Nautilus]]&quot;'']]Fulton stayed in [[Philadelphia]] for six years, where he painted portraits and landscapes, drew houses and machinery, and was able to send money home to help support his mother</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1785 he bought a farm at [[Hopewell Township, Washington County, Pennsylvania|Hopewell Township]] in [[Washington County, Pennsylvania|Washington County]] for £80 [[Pound Sterling|Sterling]] and moved his mother and family into it</span>
				<span class='text'>While in Philadelphia, he met [[Benjamin Franklin]], (1705/1706-1790), then known not only for his political and writing abilities but his scientific and inventing knowledge, and other prominent figures</span>
				<span class='text'>At age 23 he decided to visit [[Europe]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Education and work==Fulton came to England in 1786, carrying several letters of introduction to Americans abroad from the individuals he had met in Philadelphia</span>
				<span class='text'>He had already corresponded with [[Benjamin West]], and West took Fulton into his home, where Fulton lived for several years</span>
				<span class='text'>Fulton gained many commissions painting portraits and landscapes, which allowed him to support himself, but he continually experimented with mechanical inventions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=buckman/&gt;He became caught up in the enthusiasm of the &quot;Canal Mania&quot; and in 1793 began developing his ideas for tub-boat canals with inclined planes instead of locks</span>
				<span class='text'>He obtained a patent for this idea in 1794 and also began working on ideas for the steam power of boats</span>
				<span class='text'>He published a pamphlet about [[canals]] and patented a [[dredging machine]] and several other inventions</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1794 he moved to Manchester to gain practical knowledge of English canal engineering</span>
				<span class='text'>Whilst there he became friendly with [[Robert Owen]], the cotton manufacturer and early socialist</span>
				<span class='text'>Owen agreed to finance the development and promotion of his designs for inclined planes and earth-digging machines and was instrumental in introducing him to a canal company where he was awarded a sub-contract</span>
				<span class='text'>However, this practical experience was not a success and he gave up the contract after a short time</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Graham Boyes - The Peak Forest Canal - ISBN 9780901461 59 9&lt;/ref&gt;In 1797 he went to Paris where his fame as an inventor was well known</span>
				<span class='text'>In [[Paris]], then along with [[London]], the scientific centers of the 18th Century world, Fulton studied languages [[French language|French]], and [[German language|German]], along with mathematics and chemistry</span>
				<span class='text'>He began to design torpedoes and submarines</span>
				<span class='text'>In Paris, Fulton met [[James Rumsey]], (1743-1792), who sat for a portrait in West's studio, where Fulton was an apprentice</span>
				<span class='text'>Rumsey was an inventor from Virginia who ran his own first steamboat up the [[Potomac River]] near [[Shepherdstown, West Virginia|Shepherdstown]], then in [[Virginia]] in 1786</span>
				<span class='text'>As early as 1793, Fulton proposed plans for steam-powered vessels to both the United States and British governments, and in England he met the [[Francis Egerton, the 3rd Duke of Bridgewater|Duke of Bridgewater (Francis Egerton)]], (1736-1803), whose canal, the first to be constructed in Britain, was being used for trials of a steam tug</span>
				<span class='text'>Fulton became very enthusiastic about the canals and in 1796 wrote a treatise on canal construction, suggesting improvements to locks and other features</span>
				<span class='text'>Working for the Duke of Bridgewater between 1796 and 1799, he had a boat constructed in the Duke's timber yard, under the supervision of [[Benjamin Powell]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After installation of the machinery supplied by the engineers Bateman and Sherratt of Salford, the boat was duly christened ''&quot;Bonaparte&quot;'' in honour of Fulton having served under [[Napoleon]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After expensive trials, because of the configuration of the design,it was feared the paddles may damage the clay lining of the canal and the experiment was eventually abandoned</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1801 the Duke, impressed by the ''&quot;[[Charlotte Dundas]]&quot;'' constructed by [[William Symington]], (1764-1831), decided to order eight of such vessels for his canal, but when he died in 1803, the order was cancelled</span>
				<span class='text'>Symington had successfully tried steamboats in 1788, and it seems probable that Fulton was aware of these developments</span>
				<span class='text'>he first successful trial run of a steamboat had been made several years earlier by inventor [[John Fitch (inventor)|John Fitch]], (1743-1798), on the [[Delaware River]] on August 22, 1787, in the presence of delegates from the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]], then observing and taking a break from its summer-long sessions at [[Independence Hall]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It was propelled by a bank of oars on either side of the boat</span>
				<span class='text'>The following year Fitch launched a {{convert|60|ft|m|0|sing=on}} boat powered by a steam engine driving several stern mounted oars</span>
				<span class='text'>These oars paddled in a manner similar to the motion of a swimming duck's feet</span>
				<span class='text'>With this boat he carried up to thirty passengers on numerous round-trip voyages on the upper [[Delaware River]] between [[Philadelphia]] and [[Burlington, New Jersey]]</span>
				<span class='text'>itch was granted a [[patent]] on August 26, 1791, after a battle with Rumsey, who had created a similar invention</span>
				<span class='text'>Unfortunately the newly created Patent Commission did not award the broad monopoly patent that Fitch had asked for, but a patent of the modern kind, for the new design of Fitch's steamboat</span>
				<span class='text'>It also awarded patents to Rumsey and [[John Stevens (inventor)|John Stevens]], (1749-1838), for their steamboat designs, and the loss of a monopoly caused many of Fitch's investors to leave his company</span>
				<span class='text'>While his boats were mechanically successful, Fitch failed to pay sufficient attention to construction and operating costs and was unable to justify the economic benefits of steam navigation</span>
				<span class='text'>It was Fulton who would turn Fitch's idea into a more profitable proposition decades later</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Location and plaque of the Fulton experiment of 9 August 1803</span>
				<span class='text'>]In 1797, Fulton went to France, where [[Claude de Jouffroy]] (1751-1832), had made a working [[paddle steamer]] in 1783, and commenced experimenting with submarine torpedoes and torpedo boats</span>
				<span class='text'>Fulton is the exhibitor of the first [[panorama]] painting to be shown in Paris, which was complete by 1800 ''&quot;Vue de Paris depuis les Tuilerie&quot;'' painted by [[Pierre Prévost (painter)|Pierre Prévost]], (1764-1823), [[Jean Mouchet]] and [[Denis Fontaine]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Fulton designed the first working submarine, the ''&quot;[[Nautilus (1800 submarine)|Nautilus]]&quot;'' between 1793 and 1797, while living in France</span>
				<span class='text'>When tested his submarine went underwater for 17 minutes in 25 feet of water</span>
				<span class='text'>He asked the government to subsidize its construction but he was turned down twice</span>
				<span class='text'>Eventually he approached the Minister of Marine himself and in 1800 was granted permission to build</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Ambassador to France]] in 1801, who was also of a scientifically curious mind, and they decided to build a steamboat together and try running it on the [[River Seine|Seine]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Fulton experimented with the water resistance of various hull shapes, made drawings and models, and had a steamboat constructed</span>
				<span class='text'>At the first trial the boat ran perfectly, but the hull was later rebuilt and strengthened, and on August 9, 1803, this boat steamed up the River Seine, but sank</span>
				<span class='text'>The boat was {{convert|66|ft|m|1}} long, {{convert|8|ft|m|1}} beam, and made between {{convert|3|and|4|mph|km/h}} against the current</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1804, Fulton switched allegiance and moved to England, where he was commissioned by the Prime Minister [[William Pitt the Younger]], (1759-1806), to build a range of weapons for use by the [[Royal Navy]] during [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon's]] invasion scares</span>
				<span class='text'>Among his inventions were the world's first modern naval &quot;torpedoes&quot; (modern &quot;mines&quot;), which were tested, along with several other of his inventions, during the 1804 [[Raid on Boulogne]], but met with limited success</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he continued to develop his inventions with the British until 1806, the decisive naval victory by Admiral [[Horatio Nelson]] at the 1805 [[Battle of Trafalgar]] greatly reduced the risk of French invasion, and Fulton found himself being increasingly ignored</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Best&quot;/&gt;In 1806, Fulton returned to America and married Harriet Livingston, the niece of [[Robert Le Roy Livingston|Robert Livingston]] and daughter of [[Walter Livingston]]</span>
				<span class='text'>They had four children: Robert, Julia, Mary and Cornelia</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1807, Fulton and Livingston together built the first commercial steamboat, the ''&quot;[[North River Steamboat]]&quot;'' (later known as the ''&quot;Clermont&quot;''), which carried passengers between [[New York City]] and upstream to the state capital [[Albany, New York]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Clermont was able to make the 150-mile trip in 32 hours</span>
				<span class='text'>From 1811 until his death, Fulton was appointed by the [[Governor of New York]], a member of the [[Erie Canal Commission]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ulton's final design was the floating battery [[United States floating battery Demologos|''&quot;Demologos&quot;'']] the world's first steam-driven warship built for the [[United States Navy]] for the [[War of 1812]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The heavy vessel was not completed until after his death and was renamed the ''&quot;Fulton&quot;'' in his honor</span>
				<span class='text'>rom October 1811 to January 1812, Fulton, along with Livingston and Nicholas Isaac Roosevelt (1787-1854), worked together on a joint project to build and travel from [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] on their specially designed and built a new steamboat [[New Orleans (steamboat)|''&quot;New Orleans&quot;'']] solid enough for a long trip down the mid-western [[Ohio River]], with stops at [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling, Virginia]], [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], past the &quot;[[Falls of the Ohio]]&quot; at [[Louisville, Kentucky]], to near [[Cairo, Illinois]] and the juncture with the [[Mississippi River]], past [[St</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis, Missouri|St</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis]] and follow the &quot;Big Muddy&quot; as it was acquiring the nickname, all the way down past [[Memphis, Tennessee]] and [[Natchez, Mississippi]] to the city of [[New Orleans]] on the [[Gulf of Mexico]] coast, this just a decade after the United States had acquired the [[Louisiana Territory]] from [[France]] and the rivers were not well settled, mapped or protected</span>
				<span class='text'>By achieving this first breaking voyage and also proving the ability of the boat to reverse and go back upstream, changed the entire transportation outlook for the American heartland</span>

				<span class='text'>He had been walking home on the frozen Hudson River when one of his friends, Addis Emmet, fell through the ice</span>
				<span class='text'>In the attempt to rescue his friend, Fulton got soaked with icy water and on the journey home he caught [[pneumonia]]</span>
