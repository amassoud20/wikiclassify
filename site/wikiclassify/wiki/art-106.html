				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;While the Vita Columbae often conflicts with contemporaneous accounts of various battles, figures, and dates, it remains the most important surviving work from early medieval Scotland and provides a wealth of knowledge regarding the Picts and other ethnic and political groups from this time period</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Instead of relying on chronological order, Adomnán categorises the events recorded in the Vita Columbae into three different books: Columba’s Prophecies, Columba’s Miracles, and Columba’s Apparitions</span>

				<span class='text'>e |date= |accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;===Book one (Of his Prophetic Revelations)===In the first book, the author Adomnán lists Saint Columba's prophetic revelations, which come as a result of the saint's ability to view the present and the future simultaneously</span>
				<span class='text'>Most of the short chapters begin with Saint Columba informing his fellow monks that a person will soon arrive on the island or an event will immanently occur</span>
				<span class='text'>n one notable instance, Columba appears in a dream to King Oswald of Northumbria, and announces the king's incoming victory against the King Catlon (Cadwallon of Wales) in the Battle of Heavenfield</span>
				<span class='text'>The people of Britain promise to convert to Christianity and receive baptism after the conclusion of the war</span>
				<span class='text'>This victory signals the re-Christianization of pagan England, and establishes King Oswald as ruler of the entirety of Britain</span>
				<span class='text'>olumba's other prophecies can be considered vindictive at times, as when he sends a man named Batain off to perform his penance, but then Columba turns to his friends and says Batain will instead return to Scotia and be killed by his enemies</span>
				<span class='text'>Several of Saint Columba's prophecies reflect the scribal culture in which he was immersed, such his miraculous knowledge of the missing letter &quot;I” from Baithene's psalter or when he prophecies that an eager man will knock over his inkhorn and spill its contents</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Book one, Chapter 17&lt;/ref&gt;=== Book two (Of his Miraculous Powers) ===In the second book, Columba performs various miracles such as healing people with diseases, expelling malignant spirits, subduing wild beasts, calming storms, and even returning the dead to life</span>
				<span class='text'>e also performs agricultural miracles that would hold a special significance to the common people of Ireland and the British Isles, such as when he casts a demon out of a pail and restores the spilt milk to its container</span>
				<span class='text'>he Vita contains a story that has been interpreted as the first reference to the Loch Ness Monster</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Adomnán, Columba came across a group of Picts burying a man who had been killed by the monster</span>
				<span class='text'>Columba saves a swimmer from the monster with the sign of the Cross and the imprecation, &quot;Thou shalt go no further, nor touch the man; go back with all speed</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The beast flees, terrified, to the amazement of the assembled Picts who glorified Columba's God</span>
				<span class='text'>Whether or not this incident is true, Adomnan's text specifically states that the monster was swimming in the River Ness – the river flowing from the loch – rather than in Loch Ness itself</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Book two, Chapter 28&lt;/ref&gt;=== Book three (The Apparitions of Angels) ===In book three, Adomnán describes different apparitions of the Saint, both that Columba receives and those that are seen by others regarding him</span>
				<span class='text'>He mentions that, &quot;For indeed after the lapse of many years, </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>St</span>
				<span class='text'>Columba was excommunicated by a certain synod for some pardonable and very trifling reasons, and indeed unjustly&quot; (P</span>
				<span class='text'>9- 80)</span>
				<span class='text'>n one of the accounts, Saint Columba, in this period of excommunication, goes to a meeting held against him in Teilte</span>
				<span class='text'>Saint Brendan, despite of all the negative reactions among the seniors toward Columba, kisses him reverently and assures that Columba is the man of God and that he sees Holy Angels accompanying Columba on his journey through the plain</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Book three, Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;In the last Chapter, Columba foresees his own death when speaking to his attendant: &lt;blockquote&gt;This day in the Holy Scriptures is called the Sabbath, which means rest</span>
				<span class='text'>And this day is indeed a Sabbath to me, for it is the last day of my present laborious life, and on it I rest after the fatigues of my labours; and this night at midnight, which commenceth the solemn Lord's Day, I shall, according to the sayings of Scripture, go the way of our fathers</span>
				<span class='text'>For already my Lord Jesus Christ deigneth to invite me; and to Him, I say, in the middle of this night shall I depart, at His invitation</span>
				<span class='text'>For so it hath been revealed to me by the Lord himself</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;/blockquote&gt;And when the bell strikes midnight, Columba goes to the church and kneels beside the altar</span>
				<span class='text'>His attendant witnesses heavenly light in the direction of Columba, and Holy angels join the saint in his passage to the Lord: &lt;blockquote&gt;And having given them his holy benediction in this way, he immediately breathed his last</span>
				<span class='text'>After his soul had left the tabernacle of the body, his face still continued ruddy, and brightened in a wonderful way by his vision of the angels, and that to such a degree that he had the appearance, not so much of one dead, as of one alive and sleeping</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Book three, Chapter 23&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;==Other early sources of Columba's life==Both the ''Vita Columbae'' and the [[Bede|Venerable Bede]] (672/673-735) record Columba's visit to [[Bridei I of the Picts|Bridei]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Whereas Adomnán just tells us that Columba visited Bridei, Bede relates a later, perhaps Pictish tradition, whereby the saint actually converts the Pictish king</span>
				<span class='text'>Another early source is a poem in praise of Columba, most probably commissioned by Columba's kinsman, the King of the [[Uí Néill]] clan</span>
				<span class='text'>It was almost certainly written within three or four years of Columba's death and is the earliest vernacular poem in European history</span>
				<span class='text'>It consists of 25 [[stanza]]s of four verses of seven syllables each</span>
				<span class='text'>hrough the reputation of its venerable founder and its position as a major European centre of learning, Columba's Iona became a place of [[pilgrimage]]</span>
				<span class='text'>A network of Celtic [[high cross]]es marking processional routes developed around his shrine at Iona</span>
				<span class='text'>olumba is historically revered as a warrior saint, and was often invoked for victory in battle</span>
				<span class='text'>is relics were finally removed in 849 and divided between [[Alba]] and Ireland</span>
				<span class='text'>Relics of Columba were carried before Scottish armies in the reliquary made at Iona in the mid-8th century, called the Brecbennoch</span>
				<span class='text'>egend has it that the Brecbennoch was carried to the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] (24 June 1314) by the vastly outnumbered Scots army and the intercession of Columba helped them to victory</span>
				<span class='text'>It is widely thought that the [[Monymusk Reliquary]] is the object in question</span>
				<span class='text'>n the [[Antiphoner]] of [[Inchcolm Abbey]], the &quot;Iona of the East&quot; (situated on an island in the [[Firth of Forth]]), a 13th-century prayer begins ''O Columba spes Scotorum</span>
