				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|300px|Wilhelm Grimm (left) and Jacob Grimm in an 1855 painting by [[Elisabeth Jerichau-Baumann]]]]The '''Brothers Grimm''' (''{{lang|de|die Brüder Grimm}}'' or ''{{lang|de|die Gebrüder Grimm}}''), [[Jacob Grimm|Jacob]] (1785–1863) and [[Wilhelm Grimm]] (1786–1859), were German academics, linguists, cultural researchers, lexicographers and authors who together specialized in collecting and publishing [[folklore]] during the 19th century</span>
				<span class='text'>They were among the best-known storytellers of folk tales, and popularized stories such as &quot;[[Cinderella]]&quot; (&quot;{{lang|de|Aschenputtel}}&quot;), &quot;[[The Frog Prince (story)|The Frog Prince]]&quot; (&quot;{{lang|de|Der Froschkönig}}&quot;), &quot;[[The Goose-Girl]]&quot; (&quot;Die Gänsemagd&quot;), &quot;[[Hansel and Gretel]]&quot; (&quot;{{lang|de|Hänsel und Gretel}}&quot;), &quot;[[Rapunzel]]&quot;, &quot;[[Rumpelstiltskin]]&quot; (&quot;{{lang|de|Rumpelstilzchen}}&quot;),&quot;[[Sleeping Beauty]]&quot; (&quot;{{lang|de|Dornröschen}}&quot;), and &quot;[[Snow White]]&quot; (&quot;{{lang|de|Schneewittchen}}&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>Their first collection of folk tales, ''[[Grimms' Fairy Tales|Children's and Household Tales]]'' (''{{lang|de|Kinder- und Hausmärchen}}''), was published in 1812</span>
				<span class='text'>The brothers spent their formative years in the German town of [[Hanau]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Their father's death in 1796 caused great poverty for the family and affected the brothers for many years after</span>
				<span class='text'>They both attended the [[University of Marburg]] where they developed a curiosity about German folklore, which grew into a lifelong dedication to collecting German folk tales</span>
				<span class='text'>The rise of [[romanticism]] during the 19th century revived interest in traditional folk stories, which to the brothers represented a pure form of national literature and culture</span>
				<span class='text'>With the goal of researching a scholarly treatise on folk tales, they established a methodology for collecting and recording folk stories that became the basis for [[folkloristics|folklore studies]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Between 1812 and 1857, their first collection was revised and republished many times, growing from 86 stories to more than 200</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition to writing and modifying folk tales, the brothers wrote collections of well-respected German and Scandinavian mythologies, and in 1838 they began writing a definitive German dictionary (''{{lang|de|[[Deutsches Wörterbuch]]}}''), which they were unable to finish during their lifetime</span>
				<span class='text'>he popularity of the Grimms' best folk tales has endured well</span>
				<span class='text'>The tales are available in more than 100 languages and have been later adapted by filmmakers including [[Lotte Reiniger]] and [[Walt Disney]], with films such as ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' and ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>In the mid-20th century, the tales were used as propaganda by the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]]; later in the 20th century psychologists such as [[Bruno Bettelheim]] reaffirmed the value of the work, in spite of the cruelty and violence in original versions of some of the tales, which the Grimms eventually sanitized</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Michaelis-Jena-9&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Michaelis-Jena|1970|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1791, the family moved to the countryside town of [[Steinau an der Straße|Steinau]], when Philipp was employed there as district [[magistrate]] (''{{lang|de|[[Amtmann]]}}'')</span>
				<span class='text'> The family became prominent members of the community, residing in a large home surrounded by fields</span>
				<span class='text'>Biographer [[Jack Zipes]] writes that the brothers were happy in Steinau and &quot;clearly fond of country life&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Z(1988)2ff&quot;/&gt; The children were educated at home by private tutors, receiving strict instruction as [[Lutherans]] that instilled in both a lifelong religious faith</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Herbert Scurla: Die Brüder Grimm, Berlin 1985, p</span>
				<span class='text'>4-16&lt;/ref&gt; Later, they attended local schools</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;Z(1988)2ff&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Zipes|1988|pp=2–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;In 1796, Philipp Grimm died of pneumonia, which caused sudden and severe financial hardship for the large family, and they were forced to relinquish their servants and large house</span>
				<span class='text'>Dorothea depended on financial support from her father and sister, first [[lady-in-waiting]] at the court of [[William I, Elector of Hesse]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Jacob was the eldest living son, and he was forced at age 11 to assume adult responsibilities (shared with Wilhelm) for the next two years</span>
				<span class='text'>The two boys adhered to the advice of their grandfather, who continually exhorted them to be industrious</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Z(1988)2ff&quot;/&gt;The brothers left Steinau and their family in 1798 to attend the ''{{lang|de|[[Friedrichsgymnasium Kassel|Friedrichsgymnasium]]}}'' in [[Kassel]], which had been arranged and paid for by their aunt</span>
				<span class='text'>By then, they were without a male provider (their grandfather died that year), forcing them to rely entirely on each other, and they became exceptionally close</span>
				<span class='text'>The two brothers differed in temperament; Jacob was introspective and Wilhelm was outgoing (although he often suffered from ill-health)</span>
				<span class='text'>But they shared a strong work ethic and excelled in their studies</span>
				<span class='text'>In Kassel, they became acutely aware of their inferior social status relative to &quot;high-born&quot; students who received more attention</span>
				<span class='text'>Each brother graduated at the head of his class: Jacob in 1803 and Wilhelm in 1804 (he missed a year of school due to [[scarlet fever]])</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Z(1988)2ff&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Z(1988)31ff&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Zipes|1988|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;===Kassel===After graduation from the ''{{lang|de|Friedrichsgymnasium}}'', the brothers attended the [[University of Marburg]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The university was small with about 200 students and there they became painfully aware that students of lower social status were not treated equally</span>
				<span class='text'>They were disqualified from admission because of their social standing and had to request dispensation to study law</span>
				<span class='text'>Wealthier students received stipends, but the brothers were excluded even from tuition aid</span>
				<span class='text'>Their poverty kept them from student activities or university social life; ironically, however, their outsider status worked in their favor, and they pursued their studies with extra vigor</span>

				<span class='text'>ng|thumb|Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm in an 1843 drawing by their younger brother [[Ludwig Emil Grimm]]]]The brothers were inspired by their law professor [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny|Friedrich von Savigny]], who awakened in them an interest in history and [[philology]], and they turned to studying [[medieval German literature]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Z(1988)35ff&quot;/&gt; They shared Savigny's desire to see unification of the 200 German [[Principality|principalities]] into a single state</span>
				<span class='text'>Through Savigny and his circle of friends—[[German Romanticism|German romantics]] such as [[Clemens Brentano]] and [[Ludwig Achim von Arnim]]—the Grimms were introduced to the ideas of [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], who thought that German literature should revert to simpler forms, which he defined as ''{{lang|de|Volkspoesie}}'' (natural poetry) as opposed to ''{{lang|de|Kunstpoesie}}'' (artistic poetry)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Z(2002)7ff&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Zipes|2002|pp=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brothers dedicated themselves with great enthusiasm to their studies, about which Wilhelm wrote in his autobiography, &quot;the ardor with which we studied Old German helped us overcome the spiritual depression of those days</span>

				<span class='text'>in {{Harvnb|Zipes|2002|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;Jacob was still financially responsible for his mother, brother, and younger siblings in 1805, so he accepted a post in Paris as research assistant to von Savigny</span>
				<span class='text'>On his return to Marburg, he was forced to abandon his studies to support the family, whose poverty was so extreme that food was often scarce</span>
				<span class='text'>He took a job with the Hessian War Commission</span>
				<span class='text'>In a letter written to his aunt at this time, Wilhelm wrote of their circumstances, &quot;We five people eat only three portions and only once a day&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Z(1988)35ff&quot;&gt;qtd</span>
				<span class='text'>in {{Harvnb|Zipes|1988|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;Jacob found full-time employment in 1808 when he was appointed court librarian to the [[Jérôme Bonaparte|King of Westphalia]] and went on to become librarian in Kassel</span>

				<span class='text'>He arranged and paid for his brother [[Ludwig Emil Grimm|Ludwig]]'s studies at art school and for Wilhelm's extended visit to [[Halle (Westfalen)|Halle]] to seek treatment for heart and respiratory ailments, following which Wilhelm joined Jacob as librarian in Kassel</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Z(1988)2ff&quot;/&gt; The brothers also began collecting folk tales at about this time, in a cursory manner and on Brentano's request</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Jack Zipes, at this point &quot;the Grimms were unable to devote all their energies to their research and did not have a clear idea about the significance of collecting folk tales in this initial phase</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Z(1988)2ff&quot;/&gt;During their employment as librarians—which paid little but afforded them ample time for research—the brothers experienced a productive period of scholarship, publishing a number of books between 1812 and 1830</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;Z218ff&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Zipes|2000|pp=218–219}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1812, they published their first volume of 86 folk tales, ''{{lang|de|Kinder- und Hausmärchen}}'', followed quickly by two volumes of German legends and a volume of early literary history</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pitt&quot;/&gt; They went on to publish works about [[Danish folklore|Danish]] and [[Irish mythology|Irish]] folk tales and [[Norse mythology]], while continuing to edit the German folk tale collection</span>
				<span class='text'>These works became so widely recognized that the brothers received honorary doctorates from universities in [[Marburg]], [[Berlin]], and Breslau (now [[Wrocław]])</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Z218ff&quot;/&gt;=== Göttingen ===In 1825, Wilhelm married Henriette Dorothea (Dortchen) Wild, a long-time family friend and one of a group who supplied them with stories</span>
				<span class='text'>Jacob never married but continued to live in the household with Wilhelm and Dortchen</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Z(1988)7ff&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Zipes|1988|pp=7–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1830, both brothers were overlooked when the post of chief librarian came available, which disappointed them greatly</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Z218ff&quot;/&gt; They moved the household to [[Göttingen]] in the [[Kingdom of Hanover]] where they took employment at the [[University of Göttingen]], Jacob as a professor and head librarian and Wilhelm as professor</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|250px|left|Jacob Grimm lecturing (illustration by [[Ludwig Emil Grimm]], c</span>
				<span class='text'>1830)]]During the next seven years, the brothers continued to research, write, and publish</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1835, Jacob published the well-regarded ''German Mythology'' (''{{lang|de|[[Deutsche Mythologie]]}}''); Wilhelm continued to edit and prepare the third edition of ''{{lang|de|Kinder- und Hausmärchen}}'' for publication</span>
				<span class='text'>The two brothers taught  [[German studies]] at the university, becoming well-respected in the newly established discipline</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Z(1988)7ff&quot;/&gt;In 1837, they lost their university posts after joining in protest with the [[Göttingen Seven]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The 1830s were a period of political upheaval and peasant revolt in Germany, leading to the movement for democratic reform known as [[Young Germany]]</span>
				<span class='text'> The Grimm brothers were not directly aligned with the Young Germans, but five of their colleagues reacted against the demands of King [[Ernest Augustus I of Hanover|Ernest Augustus I]], who dissolved the parliament of [[Hanover]] in 1837 and demanded oaths of allegiance from civil servants—including professors at the University of Göttingen</span>
				<span class='text'>For refusing to sign the oath, the seven professors were dismissed and three were deported from Hanover, including Jacob who went to Kassel</span>
				<span class='text'>He was later joined there by Wilhelm, Dortchen, and their four children</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Z(1988)7ff&quot;/&gt;The brothers were without income in 1838 and again in extreme financial difficulty, so they began what became a lifelong project: the writing of a definitive dictionary</span>
				<span class='text'>The first volume of their ''German Dictionary'' (''{{lang|de|[[Deutsches Wörterbuch]]}}'') was not published until 1854</span>
				<span class='text'>The brothers again depended on friends and supporters for financial assistance and influence in finding employment</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Z(1988)7ff&quot;/&gt;=== Berlin and later years ===[[File:Graves of the Brothers Grimm at Alter St</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|The graves of the Brothers Grimm in [[Schöneberg]], Berlin (St</span>
				<span class='text'>Matthäus Kirchhof Cemetery)]]In 1840, von Savigny and Bettina von Arnim appealed successfully to [[Frederick William IV of Prussia]] on behalf of the brothers who were offered posts at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition to teaching posts, the [[German Academy of Sciences at Berlin|Academy of Sciences]] offered them stipends to continue their research</span>
				<span class='text'>Once they had established the household in Berlin, they directed their efforts towards the work on the German dictionary and continued to publish their research</span>
				<span class='text'>Jacob turned his attention to researching German legal traditions and the history of the German language, which was published in the late 1840s and early 1850s; meanwhile, Wilhelm began researching [[medieval literature]] while editing new editions of  ''{{lang|de|Hausmärchen}}''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Z218ff&quot;/&gt;After the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states]], the brothers were elected to the civil parliament</span>
				<span class='text'>Jacob became a prominent member of the National Assembly at [[Mainz]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Z(1988)7ff&quot;/&gt; Their political activities were short-lived, as their hope dwindled for a unified Germany and their disenchantment grew</span>
				<span class='text'> In the late 1840s, Jacob resigned his university position and saw the publication of ''The History of the German Language'' (''{{lang|de|Geschichte der deutschen Sprache}}'')</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilhelm continued at his university post until 1852</span>
				<span class='text'>After retiring from teaching, the brothers devoted themselves to the ''German Dictionary'' for the rest of their lives</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Z(1988)7ff&quot;/&gt; Wilhelm died of an infection in Berlin in 1859,&lt;ref name=&quot;NG&quot;/&gt; and Jacob became increasingly reclusive, deeply upset at his brother's death</span>
				<span class='text'>He continued work on the dictionary until his own death in 1863</span>
				<span class='text'>Zipes writes of the Grimm brothers' dictionary and of their very large body of work: &quot;Symbolically the last word was ''{{lang|de|Frucht}}'' (fruit)</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Z(1988)7ff&quot;/&gt;== Collaborations ===== ''Children's and Household Tales'' ==={{Main|Grimms' Fairy Tales}}==== Background ====The rise of [[romanticism]], [[Romantic nationalism]], and trends in valuing popular culture in the early 19th century revived interest in fairy tales, which had declined since their late-17th century peak</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Jean&quot;/&gt; [[Johann Karl August Musäus]] published a popular collection of tales between 1782 and 1787;&lt;ref name=&quot;Haase2008&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Haase|2008|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Grimms aided the revival with their folklore collection, built on the conviction that a national identity could be found in popular culture and with the common folk (''{{lang|de|Volk}}'')</span>
				<span class='text'>They collected and published tales as a reflection of German cultural identity</span>
				<span class='text'>In the first collection, though, they included [[Charles Perrault]]'s tales, published in Paris in 1697 and written for the [[salon (gathering)|literary salons]] of an aristocratic French audience</span>
				<span class='text'>Scholar Lydie Jean explains that a myth was created that Perrault's tales came from the common people and reflected existing folklore in order to justify their inclusion—even though many of them were original</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Jean&quot;/&gt;[[File:Arthur Rackham Little Red Riding Hood+</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|The Grimms defined &quot;[[Little Red Riding Hood]]&quot;, shown here in an illustration by [[Arthur Rackham]], as representative of a uniquely German tale although it existed in various versions and regions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Txxxviff&quot;/&gt;]]The brothers were directly influenced by Brentano and von Arnim, who edited and adapted the folk songs of ''{{lang|de|[[Des Knaben Wunderhorn]]}}'' (''The Boy's Magic Horn'' or [[cornucopia]])</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Haase2008&quot;/&gt; They began the collection with the purpose of creating a scholarly treatise of traditional stories and of preserving the stories as they had been handed from generation to generation—a practice that was threatened by increased industrialization</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Txxxff&quot;/&gt; [[Maria Tatar]], professor of German studies at [[Harvard University]], explains that it is precisely the handing from generation to generation and the genesis in the [[oral tradition]] that gives folk tales an important mutability</span>
				<span class='text'>Versions of tales differ from region to region, &quot;picking up bits and pieces of local culture and lore, drawing a turn of phrase from a song or another story and fleshing out characters with features taken from the audience witnessing their performance</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tatar|2004|pp=xxxvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;However, as Tatar explains, the Grimms appropriated stories as being uniquely German, such as &quot;[[Little Red Riding Hood]]&quot;, which had existed in many versions and regions throughout Europe, because they believed that such stories were reflections of Germanic culture</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Txxxviff&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Tatar|2004|pp=xxxviii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the brothers saw fragments of old religions and faiths reflected in the stories which they thought continued to exist and survive through the telling of stories</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Murphy3ff&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Murphy|2000|pp=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;==== Methodology ====When Jacob returned to Marburg from Paris in 1806, their friend Brentano sought the brothers' help in adding to his collection of folk tales, at which time the brothers began to gather tales in an organized fashion</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Z(1988)2ff&quot;/&gt; By 1810, they had produced a manuscript collection of several dozen tales, written after inviting storytellers to their home and transcribing what they heard</span>
				<span class='text'>These tales were heavily modified in transcription, and many had roots in previously written sources</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;H579&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Haase|2008|p=579}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Brentano's request, they printed and sent him copies of the 53 tales that they collected for inclusion in his third volume of ''{{lang|de|Des Knaben Wunderhorn}}''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pitt&quot;/&gt; Brentano either ignored or forgot about the tales, leaving the copies in a church in [[Alsace]] where they were found in 1920 and became known as the Ölenberg manuscript</span>
				<span class='text'>It is the earliest extant version of the Grimms' collection and has become a valuable source to scholars studying the development of the Grimms' collection from the time of its inception</span>
				<span class='text'>The manuscript was published in 1927 and again in 1975</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zipes|2000|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;The brothers gained a reputation for collecting tales from peasants, although many tales came from middle-class or aristocratic acquaintances</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilhelm's wife Dortchen Wild and her family, with their nursery maid, told the brothers some of the more well-known tales, such as &quot;[[Hansel and Gretel]]&quot; and &quot;[[Sleeping Beauty]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;J177ff&quot;/&gt; Wilhelm collected a number of tales after befriending [[August von Haxthausen]], whom he visited in 1811 in [[Westphalia]] where he heard stories from von Haxthausen's circle of friends</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Z(1988)11ff&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Zipes|1988|pp=11–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the storytellers were of [[Huguenot]] ancestry, telling tales of French origin such as those told to the Grimms by Marie Hassenpflug, an educated woman of French Huguenot ancestry,&lt;ref name=&quot;H579&quot;/&gt; and it is probable that these informants were familiar with Perrault's ''{{lang|fr|[[Histoires ou contes du temps passé]]}}'' (''Stories from Past Times'')</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Jean&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Jean|2007|pp=280–282}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other tales were collected from [[Dorothea Viehmann]], the wife of a middle-class tailor and also of French descent</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite her middle-class background, in the first English translation she was characterized as a peasant and given the name ''{{lang|de|Gammer Gretel}}''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Txxxff&quot;/&gt;[[File:Walter Crane12</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Stories such as &quot;[[Sleeping Beauty]]&quot;, shown here in a [[Walter Crane]] illustration, had been previously published and were rewritten by the Brothers Grimm</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Jean&quot;/&gt;]]According to scholars such as Ruth Bottigheimer and [[Maria Tatar]], some of the tales probably originated in written form during the [[Middle ages|medieval period]] with writers such as [[Giovanni Francesco Straparola|Straparola]] and [[Boccaccio]], but were modified in the 17th century and again rewritten by the Grimms</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, Tatar writes that the brothers' goal of preserving and shaping the tales as something uniquely German at a time of [[Convention of Artlenburg|French occupation]] was a form of &quot;intellectual resistance&quot; and, in so doing, they established a methodology for collecting and preserving folklore that set the model to be followed later by writers throughout Europe during periods of occupation</span>

				<span class='text'>Jacob established the framework, maintained through many iterations; from 1815 until his death, Wilhelm assumed sole responsibility for editing and rewriting the tales</span>
				<span class='text'>He made the tales stylistically similar, added dialogue, removed pieces &quot;that might detract from a rustic tone&quot;, improved the plots, and incorporated psychological motifs</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Z(1988)11ff&quot;/&gt; Ronald Murphy writes in ''The Owl, the Raven and the Dove'' that the brothers—and in particular Wilhelm—also added religious and spiritual motifs to the tales</span>
				<span class='text'>He believes that Wilhelm &quot;gleaned&quot; bits from [[Germanic paganism|old Germanic faiths]], Norse mythology, Roman and [[Greek mythology]], and biblical stories that he reshaped</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Murphy3ff&quot;/&gt;Over the years, Wilhelm worked extensively on the prose, expanded and added detail to the stories to the point that many grew to be twice the length of those in the earliest published editions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;T(2004)xiff&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Tatar|2004|pp=xi–xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the later editions, Wilhelm polished the language to make it more enticing to a bourgeois audience, eliminated sexual elements, and added Christian elements</span>
				<span class='text'>After 1819, he began writing for children (children were not initially considered the primary audience), adding entirely new tales or adding new elements to existing tales, elements that were often strongly didactic</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Z(1988)11ff&quot;/&gt;Some changes were made in light of unfavorable reviews, particularly from those who objected that not all the tales were suitable for children because of scenes of violence and sexuality</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;T(1987)15ff&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Tatar|1987|pp=15–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked to modify plots for many stories; for example, &quot;[[Rapunzel]]&quot; in the first edition of ''{{lang|de|Kinder- und Hausmärchen}}'' clearly shows a sexual relationship between the prince and the girl in the tower, which he edited out in subsequent editions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;T(2004)xiff&quot;/&gt; Tatar writes that morals were added (in the second edition, a king's regret was added to the scene in which his wife is to be burned at the stake) and often the characters in the tale were amended to appear more German: &quot;every [[fairy]] (''{{lang|de|Fee}}''), prince (''{{lang|de|Prinz}}'') and princess (''{{lang|de|Prinzessin}}'')—all words of French origin—was transformed into a more Teutonic-sounding enchantress (''{{lang|de|Zauberin}}'') or wise woman (''{{lang|de|weise Frau}}''), king's son (''{{lang|de|Königssohn}}''), king's daughter (''{{lang|de|Königstochter}}'')</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tatar|1987|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;==== Themes and analysis ====The Grimms' legacy contains legends, [[novella]]s, and folk stories, the vast majority of which were not intended as children's tales</span>
				<span class='text'>Von Armin was deeply concerned by the content of some of the tales, such as those which showed children being eaten, and suggested that they be removed</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, the brothers added an introduction with cautionary advice that parents steer children toward age-appropriate stories</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite von Armin's unease, none of the tales were eliminated from the collection, in the brothers' belief that all the tales were of value and reflected inherent cultural qualities</span>
				<span class='text'>Furthermore, the stories were didactic in nature at a time when discipline relied on fear, according to scholar [[Linda Dégh]], who explains that tales such as &quot;[[Little Red Riding Hood]]&quot; and &quot;[[Hansel and Gretel]]&quot; were written to be &quot;warning tales&quot; for children</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;D91ff&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Dégh|1979|pp=91–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Hansel-and-gretel-rackham</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|''[[Hansel and Gretel]]'', illustrated by [[Arthur Rackham]], was a &quot;warning tale&quot; for children</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;D91ff&quot;/&gt;]]The stories in ''{{lang|de|Kinder- und Hausmärchen}}'' include scenes of violence that have since been sanitized</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, in the Grimms' original version of &quot;[[Snow White]]&quot;, the Queen is Little Snow White's mother, not her stepmother, yet even so she orders her Huntsman to kill Snow White (her biological daughter) and bring home the child's lungs and liver so that she can eat them</span>
				<span class='text'>The story ends with the Queen mother dancing at Snow White's wedding wearing a pair of red-hot iron shoes that kill her</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jack Zipes's translation of the 1812 original edition of &quot;Folk and Fairy Tales&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Another story (&quot;The Goose Girl&quot;) has a servant being stripped naked and pushed into a barrel &quot;studded with sharp nails&quot; pointing inwards and then rolled down the street</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;NG&quot;/&gt; The Grimms' version of &quot;[[The Frog Prince (story)|The Frog Prince]]&quot; describes the princess throwing the frog against a wall instead of kissing him</span>
				<span class='text'>To some extent, the cruelty and violence may have been a reflection of medieval culture from which the tales originated, such as scenes of witches burning, as described in &quot;[[The Six Swans]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;NG&quot;/&gt;Tales with a spinning [[motif (folkloristics)|motif]] are broadly represented in the collection</span>
				<span class='text'>In her essay &quot;Tale Spinners: Submerged Voices in Grimms' Fairy Tales&quot;, children's literature scholar Bottigheimer explains that these stories reflect the degree to which spinning was crucial in the life of women in the 19th century and earlier</span>
				<span class='text'>Spinning, and particularly the spinning of [[flax]], was commonly performed in the home by women</span>
				<span class='text'>Many stories begin by describing the occupation of a main character, as in &quot;There once was a miller&quot;, yet spinning is never mentioned as an occupation, probably because the brothers did not consider it an occupation</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, spinning was a communal activity, frequently performed in a ''{{lang|de|Spinnstube}}'' (spinning room), a place where women most likely kept the oral traditions alive by telling stories while engaged in tedious work</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;B142ff&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bottigheimer|1982|pp=142–146}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the stories, a woman's personality is often reflected by her attitude toward spinning; a wise woman might be a spinster and Bottigheimer explains that the [[Spindle (textiles)|spindle]] was the symbol of a &quot;diligent, well-ordered womanhood</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bottigheimer|1982|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some stories, such as &quot;[[Rumpelstiltskin]]&quot;, spinning is associated with a threat; in others, spinning might be avoided by a character who is either too lazy or not accustomed to spinning because of her high social status</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;B142ff&quot;/&gt;&lt;!-- this needs more work; or develop in the KHM article --&gt;The tales were also criticized for being insufficiently German, which influenced the tales that the brothers included as well as their use of language</span>
				<span class='text'>Scholars such as Heinz Rölleke say that the stories are an accurate depiction of German culture, showing &quot;rustic simplicity [and] sexual modesty&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;NG&quot;/&gt; German culture is deeply rooted in the forest (''{{lang|de|wald}}''), a dark dangerous place to be avoided, most particularly the old forests with large oak trees and yet a place to which Little Red Riding Hood's mother sent her daughter to deliver food to grandmother's house</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;NG&quot;/&gt;&lt;!-- either something got lost here or it needs expansion --&gt;[[File:Rumpelstiltskin-Crane1886</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|300px|&quot;[[Rumpelstiltskin]]&quot;, shown here in an illustrated border by [[Walter Crane]], is an example of a &quot;spinning tale&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>]Some critics such as Alistair Hauke use [[Analytical psychology|Jungian analysis]] to say that the deaths of the brothers' father and grandfather are the reason for the Grimms' tendency to idealize and excuse fathers, as well as the predominance of female villains in the tales, such as the [[wicked stepmother]] and stepsisters in &quot;Cinderella&quot;, but this disregards the fact that they were collectors, not authors of the tales</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Alister|Hauke|1998|pp=216–219}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible influence is found in stories such as &quot;[[The Twelve Brothers]]&quot;, which mirrors the brothers' family structure of several brothers facing and overcoming opposition</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tatar|2004|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Autobiographical elements exist in some of the tales, and according to Zipes the work may have been a &quot;quest&quot; to replace the family life lost after their father died</span>
				<span class='text'>The collection includes 41 tales about siblings, which Zipes says are representative of Jacob and Wilhelm</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of the sibling stories follow a simple plot where the characters lose a home, work industriously at a specific task and, in the end, find a new home</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zipes|1988|pp=39–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;==== Editions ====Between 1812 and 1864, ''{{lang|de|Kinder- und Hausmärchen}}'' was published 17 times: seven of the &quot;Large edition&quot; (''{{lang|de|Große Ausgabe}}'') and ten of the &quot;Small edition&quot; (''{{lang|de|Kleine Ausgabe}}'')</span>
				<span class='text'>The Large editions contained all the tales collected to date, extensive annotations, and scholarly notes written by the brothers; the Small editions had only 50 tales and were intended for children</span>
				<span class='text'>Jacob and Wilhelm's younger brother [[Ludwig Emil Grimm|Emil Grimm]] illustrated the Small editions, adding Christian symbolism to the drawings, such as depicting Cinderella's mother as an angel, and adding a Bible to the bedside table of Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother</span>

				<span class='text'>They moved away from Brentano's practice—and that of the other romanticists—who frequently changed original oral styles of folk tale to a more literary style, which the brothers considered artificial</span>
				<span class='text'>They thought that the style of the people (the ''{{lang|de|volk}}'') reflected a natural and divinely inspired poetry (''{{lang|de|naturpoesie}}'') as opposed to the ''{{lang|de|kunstpoesie}}'' (art poetry), which they saw as artificially constructed</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;D84ff&quot;/&gt; They worked to discover and crystallize a kind of Germanness in the stories that they collected because they believed that folklore contained kernels of ancient mythologies and beliefs which were crucial to understanding the essence of German culture</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Txxxff&quot;/&gt; By examining culture from a philological point of view, they sought to establish connections between German law and culture and local beliefs</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Z(1988)32ff&quot;/&gt;The Grimms considered the tales to have origins in traditional Germanic folklore, which they thought had been &quot;contaminated&quot; by later literary tradition</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Txxxff&quot;/&gt; In the shift from the oral tradition to the printed book, tales were translated from regional dialects to [[Standard German]] (''{{lang|de|Hochdeutsch}}'' or High German)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zipes|1994|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of the many modifications and revisions, however, the Grimms sought to reintroduce regionalisms, dialects, and [[Low German]] to the tales—to re-introduce the language of the original form of the oral tale</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|2004|pp=47–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;As early as 1812, they published ''{{lang|de|Die beiden ältesten deutschen Gedichte aus dem achten Jahrhundert: Das Lied von Hildebrand und Hadubrand und das Weißenbrunner Gebet}}'' (''The Two Oldest German Poems of the Eighth Century: The Song of Hildebrand and Hadubrand and the Wessobrunn Prayer'')</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Hettinga&quot;/&gt; It was meant to be a scholarly work, yet the historical legends were often taken from secondary sources, interpreted, modified, and rewritten, resulting in works &quot;that were regarded as trademarks&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>In the 20th century, the work has maintained status as second only to the Bible as the most popular book in Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>Its sales generated a mini-industry of criticism which analyzed the tales' folkloric content in the context of literary history, socialism, and psychological elements often along [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] and [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] lines</span>
