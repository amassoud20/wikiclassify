				<span class='text'>(The latter describes his visit with his [[Portugal|Portuguese]] friends Jorge and Jose O'Neill, who were his fellows in the mid-1820s while living in Copenhagen</span>
				<span class='text'> In his travelogues, Andersen took heed of some of the contemporary conventions about travel writing, but always developed the genre to suit his own purposes</span>
				<span class='text'>Each of his travelogues combines documentary and descriptive accounts of the sights he saw with more philosophical passages on topics such as being an author, immortality, and the nature of fiction in the literary travel report</span>
				<span class='text'>Some of the travelogues, such as ''In Sweden'', even contain fairy-tales</span>
