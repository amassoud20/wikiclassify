				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Bates/&gt; As soon as he woke from the dream, the young Aeschylus began to write a tragedy, and his first performance took place in 499&amp;nbsp;BC, when he was only 26 years old</span>

				<span class='text'>In 490&amp;nbsp;BC, Aeschylus and his brother [[Cynegeirus]] fought to defend Athens against [[Darius I of Persia|Darius&amp;nbsp;I]]'s invading Persian army at the [[Battle of Marathon]]</span>

				<span class='text'>-472&quot;/&gt;In 480, Aeschylus was called into military service again, this time against [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes&amp;nbsp;I]]'s invading forces at the [[Battle of Salamis]], and perhaps, too, at the [[Battle of Plataea]] in 479</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;S34&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Sommerstein|1996|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;Aeschylus was one of many Greeks who had been initiated into the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]], a cult to [[Demeter]] based in his hometown of Eleusis</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|2000|loc=§10</span>
				<span class='text'>}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the name implies, members of the cult were supposed to have gained some secret knowledge</span>
				<span class='text'>Firm details of specific rites are sparse, as members were sworn under the penalty of death not to reveal anything about the Mysteries to non-initiates</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, according to [[Aristotle]] some thought that Aeschylus had revealed some of the cult's secrets on stage</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' 1111a8-10</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Other sources claim that an angry mob tried to kill Aeschylus on the spot, but he fled the scene</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Heracleides of Pontus]] asserts that the audience tried to stone Aeschylus</span>
				<span class='text'>He then took refuge at the altar in the orchestra of the Theater of Dionysus</span>
				<span class='text'>At his trial, he pleaded ignorance</span>
				<span class='text'>He was acquitted, with the jury sympathetic to the wounds that Aeschylus and Cynegeirus had suffered at Marathon</span>
				<span class='text'>According to the 2nd-century AD author Aelian, Aeschylus's younger brother [[Ameinias of Athens|Ameinias]] helped to acquit Aeschylus by showing the jury the stump of the hand that he lost at Salamis, where he was voted bravest warrior</span>
				<span class='text'>The truth is that the award for bravery at Salamis went not to Aeschylus' brother but to Ameinias of Pallene</span>

				<span class='text'>-472&quot; /&gt;Aeschylus travelled to [[Sicily]] once or twice in the 470s&amp;nbsp;BC, having been invited by [[Hiero&amp;nbsp;I of Syracuse]], a major Greek city on the eastern side of the island; and during one of these trips he produced ''The Women of Aetna'' (in honor of the city founded by Hieron) and restaged his ''Persians''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=S33/&gt; By 473&amp;nbsp;BC, after the death of [[Phrynichus (tragic poet)|Phrynichus]], one of his chief rivals, Aeschylus was the yearly favorite in the Dionysia, winning first prize in nearly every competition</span>

				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|250px|Modern picture of the [[Theatre of Dionysus]] in [[Athens]], where many of Aeschylus's plays were performed]]The roots of Greek drama are in religious festivals for the gods, chiefly [[Dionysus]], the god of wine</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=F241/&gt; During Aeschylus's lifetime, dramatic competitions became part of the [[City Dionysia]] in the spring</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=F241/&gt; The festival opened with a procession, followed with a competition of boys singing [[dithyramb]]s and culminated in a pair of dramatic competitions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;F242&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|1999|p=242}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first competition Aeschylus would have participated in, consisted of three playwrights each presenting three tragic plays followed by a shorter comedic [[satyr play]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=F242/&gt; A second competition of five comedic playwrights followed, and the winners of both competitions were chosen by a panel of judges</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=F242/&gt;Aeschylus entered many of these competitions in his lifetime, and various ancient sources attribute between seventy and ninety plays to him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;F243&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;P222&quot;/&gt; Only seven tragedies have survived intact: ''[[The Persians]]'', ''[[Seven against Thebes]]'', ''[[The Suppliants (Aeschylus)|The Suppliants]]'', the trilogy known as ''[[The Oresteia]]'', consisting of the three tragedies ''[[Agamemnon (play)#Agamemnon|Agamemnon]]'', ''[[Oresteia#The Libation Bearers|The Libation Bearers]]'' and ''[[The Eumenides#The Eumenides|The Eumenides]]'', together with ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'' (whose authorship is disputed)</span>
				<span class='text'>With the exception of this last play&amp;nbsp;– the success of which is uncertain&amp;nbsp;– all of Aeschylus's [[Extant literature|extant]] tragedies are known to have won first prize at the City Dionysia</span>
				<span class='text'>he Alexandrian ''Life of Aeschylus'' claims that he won the first prize at the City Dionysia thirteen times</span>
				<span class='text'>This compares favorably with Sophocles' reported eighteen victories (with a substantially larger catalogue, at an estimated 120 plays), and dwarfs the five victories of Euripides, who is thought to have written roughly 90 plays</span>
				<span class='text'>==Trilogies===One hallmark of Aeschylean [[dramaturgy]] appears to have been his tendency to write connected trilogies, in which each play serves as a chapter in a continuous dramatic narrative</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sommerstein|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Oresteia]]'' is the only extant example of this type of connected trilogy, but there is evidence that Aeschylus often wrote such trilogies</span>
				<span class='text'>The comic satyr plays that follow his trilogies also drew upon stories derived from myths</span>
				<span class='text'>or example, the ''Oresteia'''s satyr play ''[[Proteus]]'' treated the story of Menelaus'  detour in Egypt on his way home from the [[Trojan War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Based on the evidence provided by a catalogue of Aeschylean play titles, [[scholia]], and play fragments recorded by later authors, it is assumed that three other of his extant plays were components of connected trilogies: ''Seven against Thebes'' being the final play in an Oedipus trilogy, and ''The Suppliants'' and ''Prometheus Bound'' each being the first play in a Danaid trilogy and Prometheus trilogy, respectively (see below)</span>
				<span class='text'>Scholars have moreover suggested several completely lost trilogies derived from known play titles</span>
				<span class='text'>A number of these trilogies treated myths surrounding the Trojan War</span>
				<span class='text'>One, collectively called the ''[[Achilleis (trilogy)|Achilleis]]'', comprised the titles ''Myrmidons'', ''Nereids'' and ''Phrygians'' (alternately, ''The Ransoming of Hector'')</span>
				<span class='text'>nother trilogy apparently recounts the entry of the Trojan ally [[Memnon (mythology)|Memnon]] into the war, and his death at the hands of Achilles (''Memnon'' and ''The Weighing of Souls'' being two components of the trilogy); ''The Award of the Arms'', ''The Phrygian Women'', and ''The Salaminian Women'' suggest a trilogy about the madness and subsequent suicide of the Greek hero [[Ajax the great|Ajax]]; Aeschylus also seems to have written about [[Odysseus]]' return to Ithaca after the war (including his killing of his wife [[Penelope]]'s suitors and its consequences) in a trilogy consisting of ''The Soul-raisers'', ''Penelope'' and ''The Bone-gatherers''</span>
				<span class='text'>Other suggested trilogies touched on the myth of Jason and the Argonauts (''Argô'', ''Lemnian Women'', ''Hypsipylê''); the life of Perseus (''The Net-draggers'', ''Polydektês'', ''Phorkides''); the birth and exploits of Dionysus (''Semele'', ''Bacchae'', ''Pentheus''); and the aftermath of the war portrayed in ''Seven against Thebes'' (''Eleusinians'', ''Argives'' (or ''Argive Women''), ''Sons of the Seven'')</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Surviving plays===== ''The Persians'' ==={{Main|The Persians}}The earliest of his plays to survive is ''The Persians'' (''Persai''), performed in 472 BC and based on experiences in Aeschylus's own life, specifically the [[Battle of Salamis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;F244&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|1999|p=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unique among surviving Greek tragedies in that it describes a recent historical event</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=F243/&gt; ''The Persians'' focuses on the popular Greek theme of ''[[hubris]]'' by blaming Persia's loss on the pride of its king</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=F244/&gt;It opens with the arrival of a messenger in [[Susa]], the Persian capital, bearing news of the catastrophic Persian defeat at Salamis to [[Atossa]], the mother of the Persian King [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Atossa then travels to the tomb of Darius, her husband, where his ghost appears to explain the cause of the defeat</span>
				<span class='text'>It is, he says, the result of Xerxes' hubris in building a bridge across the [[Hellespont]], an action which angered the gods</span>
				<span class='text'>Xerxes appears at the end of the play, not realizing the cause of his defeat, and the play closes to lamentations by Xerxes and the chorus</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Vellacott&quot;&gt;Vellacott: 7–19&lt;/ref&gt;=== ''Seven against Thebes'' ==={{Main|Seven against Thebes}}''Seven against Thebes'' (''Hepta epi Thebas''), which was performed in 467 BC, has the contrasting theme of the interference of the gods in human affairs</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=F244/&gt; It also marks the first known appearance in Aeschylus's work of a theme which would continue through his plays, that of the [[polis]] (the city) being a key development of human civilization</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;F244246&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|1999|pp=244–246}}&lt;/ref&gt;The play tells the story of [[Eteocles]] and [[Polynices]], the sons of the shamed King of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], [[Oedipus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The sons agree to alternate in the throne of the city, but after the first year Eteocles refuses to step down, and Polynices wages war to claim his crown</span>
				<span class='text'>The brothers kill each other in single combat, and the original ending of the play consisted of lamentations for the dead brothers</span>

				<span class='text'>In the play, the [[Danaids]], the fifty daughters of [[Danaus]], founder of [[Argos]], flee a forced marriage to their cousins in Egypt</span>
				<span class='text'>They turn to King [[Pelasgus]] of Argos for protection, but Pelasgus refuses until the people of Argos weigh in on the decision, a distinctly democratic move on the part of the king</span>

				<span class='text'>During the course of the war, King Pelasgus has been killed, and Danaus rules Argos</span>
				<span class='text'>He negotiates a peace settlement with Aegyptus, as a condition of which, his fifty daughters will marry the fifty sons of Aegyptus</span>
				<span class='text'>Danaus secretly informs his daughters of an oracle predicting that one of his sons-in-law would kill him; he therefore orders the Danaids to murder their husbands on their wedding night</span>
				<span class='text'>His daughters agree</span>
				<span class='text'>''The Danaids'' would open the day after the wedding</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Sommerstein 2002, 89&quot;&gt;Sommerstein 2002, 89</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In short order, it is revealed that forty-nine of the Danaids killed their husbands as ordered; Hypermnestra, however, loved her husband Lynceus, and thus spared his life and helped him to escape</span>
				<span class='text'>Angered by his daughter's disobedience, Danaus orders her imprisonment and, possibly, her execution</span>
				<span class='text'>In the trilogy's climax and dénouement, Lynceus reveals himself to Danaus, and kills him (thus fulfilling the oracle)</span>
				<span class='text'>He and Hypermnestra will establish a ruling dynasty in Argos</span>
				<span class='text'>The other forty-nine Danaids are absolved of their murderous crime, and married off to unspecified Argive men</span>
				<span class='text'>The satyr play following this trilogy was titled ''Amymone'', after one of the Danaids</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Sommerstein 2002, 89&quot;/&gt;===''The Oresteia''==={{Main|Oresteia}}The only complete (save a few missing lines in several spots) [[trilogy]] of Greek plays by any playwright still extant is the ''[[Oresteia]]'' (458 BC); although the satyr play that originally followed it, ''[[Proteus]]'', is lost except for some fragments</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=F244/&gt;  The trilogy consists of ''[[The Oresteia#Agamemnon|Agamemnon]]'', ''[[The Oresteia#The Libation Bearers|The Libation Bearers]]'' (''Choephoroi''), and ''[[The Oresteia#The Eumenides|The Eumenides]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=F244246/&gt; Together, these plays tell the bloody story of the family of [[Agamemnon]], King of Argos</span>
				<span class='text'>===''Agamemnon''====Aeschylus begins in Greece describing the return of King [[Agamemnon]] from his victory in the [[Trojan War]], from the perspective of the towns people (the Chorus) and his wife, [[Clytemnestra]]</span>
				<span class='text'>However, dark foreshadowings build to the death of the king at the hands of his wife, who was angry at his sacrifice of their daughter [[Iphigenia]], killed so the Gods would stop a storm hindering the Greek fleet in the war</span>
				<span class='text'>She was also unhappy at his keeping of the Trojan prophetess [[Cassandra]] as a concubine</span>
				<span class='text'>Cassandra foretells of the murder of Agamemnon, and of herself, to the assembled townsfolk, who are horrified</span>
				<span class='text'>She then enters the palace knowing that she cannot avoid her fate</span>
				<span class='text'>The ending of the play includes a prediction of the return of [[Orestes (mythology)|Orestes]], son of Agamemnon, who will seek to avenge his father</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=F244246/&gt;''====''The Libation Bearers''====''The Libation Bearers'' continues the tale, opening with Orestes's arrival at Agamemnon's tomb</span>
				<span class='text'>At the tomb, Electra meets Orestes, who has returned from exile in [[Phocis]], and they plan revenge upon Clytemnestra and her lover [[Aegisthus]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Clytemnestra's account of a nightmare in which she gives birth to a snake is recounted by the chorus; and this leads her to order [[Electra]], her daughter, to pour libations on Agamemnon's tomb (with the assistance of libation bearers) in hope of making amends</span>
				<span class='text'>Orestes enters the palace pretending to bear news of his own death, and when Clytemnestra calls in Aegisthus to share in the news, Orestes kills them both</span>
				<span class='text'>Orestes is then beset by the [[Erinyes|Furies]], who avenge the murders of kin in Greek mythology</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=F244246/&gt;====''The Eumenides''====The final play of ''The Oresteia'' addresses the question of Orestes' guilt</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=F244246/&gt; The Furies drive Orestes from Argos and into the wilderness</span>
				<span class='text'>He makes his way to the temple of Apollo and begs him to drive the Furies away</span>
				<span class='text'>Apollo had encouraged Orestes to kill Clytemnestra, and so bears some of the guilt for the murder</span>
				<span class='text'>The Furies are a more ancient race of the gods, and Apollo sends Orestes to the temple of Athena, with Hermes as a guide</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=F246/&gt;The Furies track him down, and the goddess [[Athena]], patron of Athens, steps in and declares that a trial is necessary</span>
				<span class='text'>Apollo argues Orestes' case and, after the judges, including Athena deliver a tie vote, Athena announces that Orestes is acquitted</span>
				<span class='text'>She renames the Furies  ''The Eumenides'' (The Good-spirited, or Kindly Ones), and extols the importance of reason in the development of laws, and, as in ''The Suppliants'', the ideals of a democratic Athens are praised</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=F246/&gt;===''Prometheus Bound''==={{Main|Prometheus Bound}}In addition to these six works, a seventh tragedy, ''Prometheus Bound'', is attributed to Aeschylus by ancient authorities</span>
				<span class='text'>Since the late 19th century, however, scholars have increasingly doubted this ascription, largely on stylistic grounds</span>
				<span class='text'>Its production date is also in dispute, with theories ranging from the 480s BC to as late as the 410s</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=S33/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Griffith|1983|pp=32–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;The play consists mostly of static dialogue, as throughout the play the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Prometheus]] is bound to a rock as punishment from the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian]] [[Zeus]] for providing fire to humans</span>
				<span class='text'>The god [[Hephaestus]], the Titan [[Oceanus]], and the [[greek chorus|chorus]] of [[Oceanids]] all express sympathy for Prometheus' plight</span>
				<span class='text'>Prometheus meets [[Io (mythology)|Io]], a fellow victim of Zeus' cruelty; and prophesies her future travels, revealing that one of her descendants will free Prometheus</span>
				<span class='text'>The play closes with Zeus sending Prometheus into the abyss because Prometheus refuses to divulge the secret of a potential marriage that could prove Zeus' downfall</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Vellacott/&gt;The ''Prometheus Bound'' appears to have been the first play in a trilogy called the ''[[Prometheia]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>In the second play, ''[[Prometheus Unbound (Aeschylus)|Prometheus Unbound]]'', Heracles frees Prometheus from his chains and kills the eagle that had been sent daily to eat Prometheus' perpetually regenerating liver</span>
				<span class='text'>Perhaps foreshadowing his eventual reconciliation with Prometheus, we learn that Zeus has released the other Titans whom he imprisoned at the conclusion of the [[Titanomachy]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In the trilogy's conclusion, ''[[Prometheus the Fire-Bringer]]'', it appears that the Titan finally warns Zeus not to sleep with the sea nymph [[Thetis]], for she is fated to give birth to a son greater than the father</span>
				<span class='text'>Not wishing to be overthrown, Zeus marries Thetis off to the mortal Peleus; the product of that union is Achilles, Greek hero of the Trojan War</span>
				<span class='text'>After reconciling with Prometheus, Zeus probably inaugurates a festival in his honor at Athens</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|250px|Mosaic of [[Orestes (mythology)|Orestes]], main character in Aeschylus's only surviving trilogy, ''[[The Oresteia]]'']]When Aeschylus first began writing, the theatre had only just begun to evolve, although earlier playwrights like [[Thespis]] had already expanded the cast to include an actor who was able to interact with the [[Greek chorus|chorus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;P222&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Pomeroy|1999|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aeschylus added a second actor, allowing for greater dramatic variety, while the chorus played a less important role</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=P222/&gt; He is sometimes credited with introducing ''skenographia'', or scene-decoration,&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Vitruvius]]</span>
				<span class='text'>See Summers 2007, 23</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; though Aristotle gives this distinction to Sophocles</span>
				<span class='text'>Aeschylus is also said to have made the costumes more elaborate and dramatic, and having his actors wear platform boots (''cothurni'') to make them more visible to the audience</span>
				<span class='text'>According to a later account of Aeschylus's life, as they walked on stage in the first performance of the ''Eumenides'', the chorus of Furies were so frightening in appearance that they caused young children to faint, patriarchs to urinate, and pregnant women to go into labour</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Life of Aeschylus''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;His plays were written in verse, no violence is performed on stage, and the plays have a remoteness from daily life in Athens, either by relating stories about the gods or by being set, like ''The Persians'', in far-away locales</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;P223&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Pomeroy|1999|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aeschylus's work has a strong moral and religious emphasis</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=P223/&gt; The ''Oresteia'' trilogy concentrated on man's position in the cosmos in relation to the gods, divine law, and divine punishment</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pomeroy|1999|pp=224–225}}&lt;/ref&gt;Aeschylus's popularity is evident in the praise the comic playwright [[Aristophanes]] gives him in ''[[The Frogs]]'', produced some half-century after Aeschylus's death</span>
				<span class='text'>Appearing as a character in the play, Aeschylus claims at line 1022 that his ''Seven against Thebes'' &quot;made everyone watching it to love being warlike&quot;; with his ''Persians'', Aeschylus claims at lines 1026–7 that he &quot;taught the Athenians to desire always to defeat their enemies</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Aeschylus goes on to say at lines 1039ff</span>
				<span class='text'>that his plays inspired the Athenians to be brave and virtuous</span>

				<span class='text'>Michael Ewans argues in his ''Wagner and Aeschylus</span>
				<span class='text'>The Ring and the Oresteia'' (London: Faber</span>
				<span class='text'>1982) that the influence was so great as to merit a direct character by character comparison between Wagner's ''Ring'' and Aeschylus's ''Oresteia''</span>
