				<span class='text'>name F241  The festival opened with a procession followed with a competition of boys singing s and culminated in a pair of dramatic competitions</span>
				<span class='text'>name F242  The first competition Aeschylus would have participated in consisted of three playwrights each presenting three tragic plays followed by a shorter comedic </span>
				<span class='text'>name F242  A second competition of five comedic playwrights followed and the winners of both competitions were chosen by a panel of judges</span>
				<span class='text'>name F242 Aeschylus entered many of these competitions in his lifetime and various ancient sources attribute between seventy and ninety plays to him</span>
				<span class='text'>name F243  name P222  Only seven tragedies have survived intact    the trilogy known as  consisting of the three tragedies   and  together with  whose authorship is disputed</span>
				<span class='text'>With the exception of this last playampnbsp– the success of which is uncertainampnbsp– all of Aeschyluss  tragedies are known to have won first prize at the City Dionysia</span>
				<span class='text'>he Alexandrian Life of Aeschylus claims that he won the first prize at the City Dionysia thirteen times</span>
				<span class='text'>This compares favorably with Sophocles reported eighteen victories with a substantially larger catalogue at an estimated 120 plays and dwarfs the five victories of Euripides who is thought to have written roughly 90 plays</span>
				<span class='text'>ne hallmark of Aeschylean  appears to have been his tendency to write connected trilogies in which each play serves as a chapter in a continuous dramatic narrative</span>
				<span class='text'>  is the only extant example of this type of connected trilogy but there is evidence that Aeschylus often wrote such trilogies</span>
				<span class='text'>The comic satyr plays that follow his trilogies also drew upon stories derived from myths</span>
				<span class='text'>or example the Oresteias satyr play  treated the story of Menelaus  detour in Egypt on his way home from the </span>
				<span class='text'>Based on the evidence provided by a catalogue of Aeschylean play titles  and play fragments recorded by later authors it is assumed that three other of his extant plays were components of connected trilogies Seven against Thebes being the final play in an Oedipus trilogy and The Suppliants and Prometheus Bound each being the first play in a Danaid trilogy and Prometheus trilogy respectively see below</span>
				<span class='text'>Scholars have moreover suggested several completely lost trilogies derived from known play titles</span>
				<span class='text'>A number of these trilogies treated myths surrounding the Trojan War</span>
				<span class='text'>One collectively called the  comprised the titles Myrmidons Nereids and Phrygians alternately The Ransoming of Hector</span>
				<span class='text'>nother trilogy apparently recounts the entry of the Trojan ally  into the war and his death at the hands of Achilles Memnon and The Weighing of Souls being two components of the trilogy The Award of the Arms The Phrygian Women and The Salaminian Women suggest a trilogy about the madness and subsequent suicide of the Greek hero  Aeschylus also seems to have written about  return to Ithaca after the war including his killing of his wife s suitors and its consequences in a trilogy consisting of The Soul raisers Penelope and The Bone gatherers</span>
				<span class='text'>Other suggested trilogies touched on the myth of Jason and the Argonauts Argô Lemnian Women Hypsipylê the life of Perseus The Net draggers Polydektês Phorkides the birth and exploits of Dionysus Semele Bacchae Pentheus and the aftermath of the war portrayed in Seven against Thebes Eleusinians Argives or Argive Women Sons of the Seven</span>

				<span class='text'>In the trilogys climax and dénouement Lynceus reveals himself to Danaus and kills him thus fulfilling the oracle</span>
				<span class='text'>He and Hypermnestra will establish a ruling dynasty in Argos</span>
				<span class='text'>The other forty nine Danaids are absolved of their murderous crime and married off to unspecified Argive men</span>
				<span class='text'>The satyr play following this trilogy was titled Amymone after one of the Danaids</span>

				<span class='text'>name F244   The trilogy consists of   Choephoroi and </span>
				<span class='text'>name F244246  Together these plays tell the bloody story of the family of  King of Argos</span>

				<span class='text'>She was also unhappy at his keeping of the Trojan prophetess  as a concubine</span>
				<span class='text'>Cassandra foretells of the murder of Agamemnon and of herself to the assembled townsfolk who are horrified</span>
				<span class='text'>She then enters the palace knowing that she cannot avoid her fate</span>
				<span class='text'>The ending of the play includes a prediction of the return of  son of Agamemnon who will seek to avenge his father</span>

				<span class='text'>He makes his way to the temple of Apollo and begs him to drive the Furies away</span>
				<span class='text'>Apollo had encouraged Orestes to kill Clytemnestra and so bears some of the guilt for the murder</span>
				<span class='text'>The Furies are a more ancient race of the gods and Apollo sends Orestes to the temple of Athena with Hermes as a guide</span>

				<span class='text'>Apollo argues Orestes case and after the judges including Athena deliver a tie vote Athena announces that Orestes is acquitted</span>

				<span class='text'>Since the late 19th century however scholars have increasingly doubted this ascription largely on stylistic grounds</span>
				<span class='text'>Its production date is also in dispute with theories ranging from the 480s BC to as late as the 410s</span>
