				<span class='text'>They were joined in the north by Nicaraguan Democratic Force (FDN) and in the south by former Sandinistas and peasantry who under the leadership of [[Edén Pastora]] were resisting forced collectivization</span>

				<span class='text'>People within the [[Reagan administration]] authorized the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] to begin financing, arming and training rebels, some of whom were former officers from Somoza's National Guard, as anti-Sandinista guerrillas</span>
				<span class='text'>These were known collectively as the [[Contra (guerrillas)|Contras]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This also led to one of the largest political scandals in US history, (the [[Iran Contra Affair]]), when [[Oliver North]] and several members of the Reagan administration defied the [[Boland Amendment]], selling arms to [[Iran]] and then using the proceeds to fund the [[Contras]]</span>

				<span class='text'>On 15 March 1982, the Junta declared a state of siege, which allowed it to close independent radio stations, suspend the right of association and limit the freedom of trade unions</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; However, some historians accuse the Contras of having a far poorer Human Rights Record during the same period, with documented cases of murder, rape and torture used to terrorize the rural population</span>
				<span class='text'>There is also evidence that the Contras engaged in destruction of schools, hospitals, and other infrastructure, in order to disrupt the social reform programs of the Sandinistas</span>
