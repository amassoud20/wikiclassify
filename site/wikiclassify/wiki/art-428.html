				<span class='text'>1230 – 11 October 1303), born '''Benedetto Caetani''', was [[Pope]] from 24 December 1294 to his death in 1303</span>
				<span class='text'>e organized the first Roman Catholic &quot;[[Jubilee (Christianity)|jubilee]]&quot; year to take place in [[Rome]] and declared that both spiritual and temporal power were under the pope's jurisdiction, and that kings were subordinate to the power of the Roman pontiff</span>

				<span class='text'>1230 in [[Anagni]], some thirty-one miles (c</span>
				<span class='text'>50 kilometres) southeast of [[Rome]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a younger son of Roffredo Caetani (Podestà of Todi in 1274/1275), a member of a baronial family of the Papal States, the [[Caetani]], or ''Gaetani'' of Aquila</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;His elder brother, Roffredo or Goffredo, was the first Conte di Caserta from 1288, Signore di Calvi, Vairano e Norma in 1282, Senator of Rome 1290/1292, Signore di Vairano by decree of the King of Sicily on 1 April 1291, Podestà of Todi (1282/5-1283), Signore di Caserta (1290)</span>
				<span class='text'> He had a younger brother, Giovanni, and three sisters</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Through his mother, Emilia Patrasso di Guarcino,  a niece of Pope Alexander IV (Rinaldo dei Conti di Segni—who was himself a nephew of Pope Gregory IX), he was not far distant from the seat of ecclesiastical power and patronage</span>
				<span class='text'> His father's younger brother, Atenolfo, was Podestà di Orvieto</span>

				<span class='text'>9</span>
				<span class='text'>Tosti, p</span>
				<span class='text'>37</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  He took his first steps in the religious life when he was sent to the monastery of the Friars Minor in [[Velletri]], where he was put under the care of his maternal uncle Fra Leonardo Patrasso</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tosti, p</span>
				<span class='text'>37, citing Teuli, ''History of Velletri'', Book 2, chapter 5</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In 1252, when his paternal uncle Pietro Caetani became [[Bishop of Todi]], in [[Umbria]], Benedetto followed him to Todi and began his legal studies there</span>
				<span class='text'>He was granted a [[Canon (priest)|canonry]] of the cathedral in the family's stronghold of Anagni, with the permission of Pope Alexander (1254-1261)</span>
				<span class='text'>His uncle Pietro Caetani granted him a canonry in the Cathedral of Todi in 1260</span>
				<span class='text'>He also came into possession of the small nearby castello of [[Sismano]], a place with twenty-one fires (hearths, families)</span>
				<span class='text'>  In later years Father Vitalis, the Prior of S</span>
				<span class='text'>Egidio de S</span>
				<span class='text'>Gemino in Narni testified that he knew him and conversed with him in Todi and that Benedetto was in a school run by Rouchetus, a Doctor of Laws, from that city</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pierre Dupuy,  ''Histoire du differend d'entre le Pape Boniface VIII</span>
				<span class='text'>et Philippes le Bel, Roy de France'' (Paris 1655), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>527-528</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Benedetto never forgot his roots in [[Todi]], later describing the city as &quot;the dwelling place of his early youth,&quot; the city which &quot;nourished him while still of tender years,&quot; and as a place where he &quot;held lasting memories</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;  Later in life he repeatedly expressed his gratitude to Anagni, Todi, and his family</span>
				<span class='text'>==Early career===In 1264 Benedetto entered the [[Roman Curia]],  perhaps with the office of Advocatus</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ptolemaeus of Lucca ''Historia ecclesiastica'' XXIII</span>
				<span class='text'>26 (Muratori ''Rerum Italicarum Scriptores'' XI, p</span>
				<span class='text'>203)</span>
				<span class='text'>Tosti (p</span>
				<span class='text'>37) believed that Caetani held the office of Advocatus before he set out with Cardinal Ottoboni on the English legation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  He served as secretary to [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] Simon de Brion, the future [[Pope Martin IV]], on a mission to France</span>
				<span class='text'> Cardinal Simon had been appointed by Pope Urban IV (Jacques Pantaléon), between 25 and 27 April 1264, to engage in negotiations with Charles of Anjou, Comte de Provence, over the crown of Naples and Sicily</span>
				<span class='text'> On 1 May 1264 he was given permission to appoint two or three ''tabelliones'' (secretaries) for his mission, one of whom was Benedetto</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;August Potthast, ''Regesta Pontificum Romanorum''  II (Berlin 1875), p</span>
				<span class='text'>1543, nos</span>
				<span class='text'>18858, 18859, 18867</span>
				<span class='text'>Pope Urban had held a Consistory on 25 April, at which the matter of naming Charles of Anjou as Senator of Rome was discussed</span>
				<span class='text'>It was after this meeting that Cardinal Simon was given his Legation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;On 26 February 1265, only eleven days after his coronation, the new pope, Clement VI (Guy Foulques), wrote to Cardinal Simon, telling him to break off negotiations and travel immediately to Provence, where he would receive further instructions</span>
				<span class='text'> On the same day, Clement wrote to Charles of Anjou, informing him that the pope had 35 conditions that Charles must agree to in accepting the crown; he also wrote to Henry III of England and his son Edmund that they had never been possessors of the Kingdom of Sicily</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;August Potthast, ''Regesta Pontificum Romanorum''  II (Berlin 1875), p</span>
				<span class='text'>1543, nos</span>
				<span class='text'>19037-19039</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He also commended to the Cardinal the Sienese bankers who had been working for Urban IV to raise funds for Charles of Anjou, and that he should transfer to them some 7,000 pounds Tournois from the ''decima'' of France</span>
				<span class='text'> On 20 March 1265, in order to expedite the business with Charles of Anjou, Cardinal Simon was authorized to provide benefices from cathedrals or otherwise within his province to five of his clerics</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Potthast, no</span>
				<span class='text'>19065</span>
				<span class='text'>These were benefices which in the course of things were in the hands of the Pope</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This may have been the occasion on which Benedetto Caetani acquired at least some of his French benefices</span>
				<span class='text'> On 9 April 1265, on the petition of Cardinal Simon de Brion, the legation which had been assigned him by Pope Urban was declared ''not'' to have expired on the death of Urban IV</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Potthast, 19089</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  There would have been no point in making such a ruling if Cardinal Simon had already ceased to be Legate</span>
				<span class='text'>enedetto also accompanied Cardinal Ottobono Fieschi,&lt;ref&gt;This derives from a statement of Pope Clement V in 1309, during the agitation for a posthumous trial of Boniface VIII:  A</span>
				<span class='text'>Theiner (ed</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; the future [[Pope Adrian V]], to England</span>
				<span class='text'>Another member of Cardinal Ottobono's suite was Theobaldus of Piacenza, Archdeacon of Liège, who became a friend of Prince Edward, and went on Crusade with him; he was later elected Pope Gregory X</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Francis Gasquet, ''Henry the Third and the English Church'' (London 1905), p</span>
				<span class='text'>414</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  On 4 May 1265 Cardinal Ottobono was appointed Apostolic Legate to England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland by the new Pope Clement IV;&lt;ref&gt;''Registres de Clément IV'' I, nos</span>
				<span class='text'>40-78</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; in fact, he was sent as the successor of  Cardinal Guy Folques, who had been elected Clement IV on 5 February 1265</span>
				<span class='text'>On 29 August 1265 the Cardinal was received at the French Court by King Louis IX</span>
				<span class='text'> There he learned that Simon de Montfort and his son Henry had been killed at the Battle of Evesham earlier that month</span>
				<span class='text'> Cardinal Ottobono did not reach Boulogne until October 1265</span>
				<span class='text'>He was in England until July 1268, working to suppress the remnants of Simon de Montfort's [[barons]] who were still in arms against King [[Henry III of England]]</span>
				<span class='text'>To finance their rebellion, the barons had imposed a 10% tax on church property, which the Pope wanted back, not only because the tithe was uncanonical, but also so that he could use the funds already collected for his own purposes</span>
				<span class='text'>This  drawback was a major concern of Cardinal Ottobono and his entourage</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Francis Gasquet, ''Henry the Third and the English Church'' (London 1905), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>403-416</span>

				<span class='text'>15&lt;/ref&gt;Upon Benedetto's return from England, there is an eight-year period in which nothing is known about his life</span>
				<span class='text'> This period, however, included the long vacancy of the papal throne from 29 November 1268 to February 1272, when Pope Gregory X accepted the papal throne</span>
				<span class='text'> It also includes the time span when Pope Gregory and his cardinals went to France in 1273 for the Council of Vienne</span>
				<span class='text'> The Pope and some of the cardinals began their return to Italy at the end of November 1275</span>
				<span class='text'> Pope Gregory celebrated Christmas in Arezzo and died there on 10 January 1276</span>
				<span class='text'> In 1276, however, Benedetto was sent to France to supervise the collection of a [[tithe]], which is perhaps when he held the office of Advocatus in the Roman Curia,&lt;ref&gt;Tosti (p</span>
				<span class='text'>37) believed that Caetani held the office of Advocatus before he set out with Cardinal Ottoboni on the English legation</span>
				<span class='text'> And yet, Ottobono Fieschi was elected Pope Adrian V on 11 July 1276 and died on 18 August 1276</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and then was appointed a papal Notary in the late 1270s</span>
				<span class='text'>During this time, Benedetto accumulated seventeen [[benefices]], which he was permitted to keep when he was promoted</span>
				<span class='text'>Some of these are enumerated in a bull of Pope Martin IV, in which he bestows the Deaconry of S</span>
				<span class='text'>Nicolas in carcere on Cardinal Benedetto Caetani</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tosti, p</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;   In the winter of 1289, he was one of Pope Nicholas IV's advisors as he decided on a settlement of the disputes over the election or appointment of Portuguese bishops, in which King Denis played a major role</span>
				<span class='text'> To give greater authority to the final mandate of the Pope, Cardinal Latino Orsini of Ostia, Cardinal Pietro Peregrosso of S</span>

				<span class='text'>Agata, and his old deaconry of S</span>
				<span class='text'>Nicola in Carcere</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;It is sometimes said that he also received the Deaconry of S</span>
				<span class='text'>Agnes, but S</span>
				<span class='text'>Agnes was not a deaconry or a titulus in the XIII century</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  As cardinal, he served as [[papal legate]] in diplomatic negotiations to France, Naples, Sicily, and Aragon</span>
				<span class='text'>==Abdication of Celestine V and Election of Boniface VIII===[[Pope Celestine V]] (Brother Peter, the hermit of Mount Murrone near Sulmone) [[papal abdication|abdicated]] on 13 December 1294 at [[Naples]], where, much to the discomfort of a number of cardinals, he had established the papal court under the patronage of King [[Charles II of Sicily]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He had continued to live like a monk there, even turning a room in the papal apartment into the semblance of a monastic cell</span>
				<span class='text'>A contemporary, [[Bartholomew of Lucca]], who was present in Naples in December 1294 and witnessed many of the events of the abdication and election, said that Benedetto Caetani was only one of several cardinals who pressured Celestine to resign</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bartholomew of Lucca, in:  Odoricus Raynaldus [Rainaldi], ''Annales Ecclesiastici'' Tomus Quartus [Volume XXIII] (Lucca: Leonardo Venturini 1749), sub anno 1294,  p</span>
				<span class='text'>156:  ''Dominus Benedictus cum aliquibus cardinalibus Caelestino persuasit ut officio cedat quia propter simplicitatem suam, licet sanctus vir, et vitae magni foret exempli, saepius adversis confundabantur ecclesiae in gratiis faciendis et circa regimen orbis''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  However, it is also on record that Celestine V resigned by his own design after consultation with experts, and that Benedetto merely showed that it was allowed by Church law</span>
				<span class='text'>Either way, Celestine V vacated the throne and Benedetto Caetani was elected in his place as pope, taking the name Boniface VIII</span>
				<span class='text'>he [[Papal conclave, 1294|conclave]] began on 23 December 1294, ten days after Celestine's resignation</span>
				<span class='text'>The regulations promulgated by Pope Gregory X at the [[Second Council of Lyons]] of 1274 did not envision a papal resignation (any more than did the regulations of Pope John Paul II), but the cardinals waited the usual ten days from the papal resignation</span>
				<span class='text'> All twenty-two cardinals were thus given the chance to assemble at the Castel Nuovo in Naples, the site of the resignation</span>
				<span class='text'> [[Hugh Aycelin]],&lt;ref&gt;also known as Hughes (Seguin) of [[Billom]] and Hughes de Billay, of the French province of the [[Dominican Order]], former lector at the ''studium'' of [[Santa Sabina]] which would develop into the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] in the 20th century</span>
				<span class='text'>Cardinal Hugh had been created a cardinal priest by Pope Nicholas IV on 16 May 1288, with the title of Santa Sabina, and was promoted Cardinal-Bishop of the suburbicarian [[see of Ostia]] in August, 1294, by Celestine V</span>

				<span class='text'> But in the succeeding sixty years, numerous legal decisions were made by one pope after another</span>
				<span class='text'> By Boniface's time a new and expanded edition was needed</span>
				<span class='text'> In 1298 Boniface ordered published as a sixth part (or Book) these various papal decisions, including some 88 of his own legal decisions, as well as a collection of legal principles known as the &quot;Regulae Iuris&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In political theory, Pope Boniface VIII claimed that the popes were the final authority over both the church and the state</span>
				<span class='text'>==Cardinals===Boniface VIII put forward some of the strongest claims to temporal as well as spiritual power of any Pope</span>
				<span class='text'>He involved himself often with foreign affairs</span>
				<span class='text'>In his [[Papal bull|Bull]] of 1302, ''[[Unam Sanctam]]'', Boniface VIII stated that since the Church is one, since the Church is necessary for salvation, and since Christ appointed Peter to lead it, it is &quot;absolutely necessary for salvation that every human creature be subject to the Roman pontiff&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>The two Colonna Cardinals, Giacomo, created Cardinal Deacon of S</span>
				<span class='text'>Maria in Via Lata in 1278, and Pietro, created Cardinal Deacon of S</span>
				<span class='text'>Eustachio in 1288, were deposed from their cardinalates on 10 May 1297</span>
				<span class='text'> The quarrel with the Colonnas culminated in Boniface VIII ordering the destruction in 1298 of their family city [[Palestrina]] after it surrendered peacefully under Boniface's assurances that it would be spared</span>
				<span class='text'>Much of the city still boasted intact buildings and monuments from ancient Roman times, but Boniface razed it anyway, even spreading salt on the site as the Romans did in [[Carthage#Fall|Carthage]] 1500 years before</span>
				<span class='text'>Only the city's cathedral was spared</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;To deal with the problem of the cardinals left to him by his predecessors, Boniface created new cardinals on five occasions during his reign</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Conrad Eubel, ''Hierarchia catholica medii aevi'' I edition altera (Monasterii 1913), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>12-13</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  In the first creation, in 1295, only one cardinal was appointed, the Pope's nephew Benedetto Caetano</span>
				<span class='text'> This was no surprise</span>
				<span class='text'> Nor was the second creation, on 17 December 1295</span>
				<span class='text'> Two more relatives were appointed,  Francesco Caetano, the son of Boniface VIII's brother Peter; and Jacopo (Giacomo) Tomassi Caetani, OFM, a son of the Pope's sister, was made Cardinal Priest of S</span>
				<span class='text'>Clemente</span>
				<span class='text'> Giacomo Caetani Stefaneschi, a grand-nephew of Pope Nicholas III, was also appointed, along with Francesco Napoleone Orsini, a nephew of Pope Nicholas III</span>
				<span class='text'> Three years later, on 4 December 1298, four new cardinals were named: Gonzalo Gudiel (Gundisalvus Rodericus Innojosa), Archbishop of Toledo, was appointed Bishop of Albano; Teodorico Ranieri, Archbishop-elect of Pisa and papal Chamberlain, became Cardinal Priest of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme; Niccolò Boccasini, OP, of Treviso, Master General of the Dominicans, became Cardinal Priest of Santa Sabina; and Riccardo Petroni of Siena, Vice-Chancellor of the Holy Roman Church, was named a Cardinal Deacon</span>
				<span class='text'>A pattern begins to emerge, though one sees the pattern only in terms of negatives:  of the ten new cardinals, only two are monks, and neither of them Benedictine (Celestine V had been excessively partial to Benedictines);  and there are no Frenchmen (Celestine had named seven Frenchmen, under the influence of Charles II of Naples)</span>
				<span class='text'> Pope Boniface was distinctly changing the complexion of the membership of the Sacred College</span>
				<span class='text'> Without the Colonnas, the influence of the King of France was greatly diminished</span>
				<span class='text'>n 2 March 1300, during the Great Jubilee, Boniface VIII created three more cardinals</span>
				<span class='text'>The first was Leonardo Patrasso, Archbishop of Capua, who was Boniface VIII's uncle; he replaced the Archbishop of Toledo, who had died in 1299, as Cardinal Bishop of Albano</span>
				<span class='text'>The second was Gentile Partino, OFM, Doctor of Theology and Lector of Theology in the Roman Curia, who was made Cardinal Priest of S</span>
				<span class='text'>Martin in montibus</span>
				<span class='text'>The third was Luca Fieschi, of the Counts of Lavagna, of Genoa, named Cardinal Deacon of S</span>
				<span class='text'>Maria in Via Lata (the deaconry which had once belonged to Jacopo Colonna)</span>
				<span class='text'>A relative, a Franciscan; all three Italians</span>
				<span class='text'>n his last Consistory for the promotion of Cardinals, on 15 December 1302, Boniface VIII named two more cardinals: Pedro Rodríguez, bishop of Burgos, Spain, became Suburbicarian Bishop of Sabina; and Giovanni Minio da Morrovalle (or da Muro), OFM, Minister General of the Franciscans, was appointed Suburbicarian Bishop of Porto</span>
				<span class='text'> A Franciscan, a Spaniard, no Benedictines, no French</span>
				<span class='text'> In fact, there were only two French in the Sacred College at Boniface's death, only five regular clergy (only one Benedictine)</span>
				<span class='text'>== Conflicts in Sicily and Italy ===When King [[Frederick III of Sicily]] attained his throne after the death of [[Pedro III of Aragon|Pedro III]], Boniface tried to dissuade him from accepting the throne of [[Sicily]]</span>
				<span class='text'>When Frederick persisted, Boniface laid [[excommunication]] on him, and an [[interdict]] upon the island of [[Sicily]] in 1296 that denied Catholic priests the right to conduct certain services there</span>
				<span class='text'>Neither king nor people responded to this censure</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Catholic Encyclopedia, II, 663d&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict continued until the [[Peace of Caltabellotta]] in 1302, which saw Pedro's son Frederick III recognized as king of Sicily, while [[Charles II of Naples|Charles II]] was recognized as the [[King of Naples]]</span>
				<span class='text'>To prepare for a [[crusade]], Boniface ordered [[Venice]] and [[Genoa]] to sign a truce; they fought each other for three more years, and turned down his offer to mediate peace</span>
				<span class='text'>oniface also placed the city of [[Florence]] under an [[interdict]] and invited the ambitious French Count [[Charles of Valois]] to enter [[Italy]] in 1300 to end the feud of Black and White [[Guelphs]], the poet [[Dante]] being in the party of the Whites</span>
				<span class='text'>Boniface's political ambitions directly affected Dante when the pope, under the pretense of peacemaking, invited Charles of Valois to intervene in the affairs of Florence</span>
				<span class='text'>Charles's intervention allowed the Black Guelphs to overthrow the ruling White Guelphs, whose leaders, including the poet Dante, allegedly in Rome at the time to argue Florence's case before Boniface, were sentenced to exile</span>
				<span class='text'>Dante settled his score with Boniface in the first canticle of the [[Divine Comedy]], the [[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]], by damning the pope, placing him within the circles of Fraud, in the [[Malebolge|bolgia]] of the [[simony|simoniacs]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In the Inferno, [[Pope Nicholas III]], mistaking the Poet for Boniface, is surprised to see the latter, supposing him to be ahead of his time</span>

				<span class='text'>9–63&lt;/ref&gt;=== Conflicts with Philip IV ===[[File:Hommage of Edward I to Philippe le Bel</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|Philip IV receiving the homage of Edward I for Aquitaine</span>
				<span class='text'>]The conflict between Boniface VIII and King Philip IV of France came at a time of expanding nation states and the desire for the consolidation of power by the increasingly powerful monarchs</span>
				<span class='text'>The increase in monarchical power and its conflicts with the Church of Rome were only exacerbated by the rise to power of Philip IV</span>
				<span class='text'> In France, the process of centralizing royal power and developing a genuine national state began with the Capetian kings</span>
				<span class='text'>During his reign, Philip surrounded himself with the best civil lawyers and decidedly expelled the clergy from all participation in the administration of the law</span>
				<span class='text'>With the clergy beginning to be taxed in France and England to finance their ongoing wars against each other, Boniface took a hard stand against it</span>
				<span class='text'>He saw the taxation as an assault on traditional clerical rights and ordered the [[Papal bull|bull]] ''[[Clericis laicos]]'' in February 1296, forbidding lay taxation of the clergy without prior papal approval</span>
				<span class='text'>In the bull, Boniface states &quot;they exact and demand from the same the half, [[tithe]], or twentieth, or any other portion or proportion of their revenues or goods; and in many ways they try to bring them into slavery, and subject them to their authority</span>
				<span class='text'>And also whatsoever emperors, kings, or princes, dukes, earls or barons</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>resume to take possession of things anywhere deposited in holy buildings</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>hould incur sentence of [[excommunication]]</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; It was during the issuing of ''[[Clericis laicos]]'' that hostilities between Boniface and Philip began</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip retaliated against the bull by denying the exportation of money from France to Rome, funds that the Church required to operate</span>
				<span class='text'>Boniface had no choice but to contest Philip's demands, informing Philip that &quot;God has set popes over kings and kingdoms</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;Philip was convinced that the wealth of the [[Catholic Church]] in [[France]] should be used in part to support the state</span>
				<span class='text'>He wanted to make war against the English</span>

				<span class='text'>272-273</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He countered the [[papal bull]] by decreeing laws prohibiting the export of gold, silver, precious stones, or food from France to the Papal States</span>
				<span class='text'>These measures had the effect of blocking a main source of papal revenue</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip also banished from France the papal agents who were raising funds for a new crusade in the Middle East</span>

				<span class='text'>193-196</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Boniface retreated</span>
				<span class='text'>He sanctioned voluntary contributions from the clergy for the necessary defense of the state and gave the king the right to determine that necessity</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip rescinded his ordinances regarding the exports and even accepted Boniface as arbitrator in a dispute between himself and King [[Edward I of England]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Boniface decided most of those issues in Philip's favor</span>

				<span class='text'>The event was a success; Rome had never received such crowds before</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Boniface and his aides managed the affair well, food was plentiful, and it was sold at moderate prices</span>
				<span class='text'>It was an advantage to the pope that the great sums of money he collected could be used according to Boniface's own judgment</span>
				<span class='text'>==Continued feud with Philip IV===The feud between Boniface and Philip IV reached its peak in the early 14th century, when Philip began to launch a strong anti-papal campaign against Boniface</span>
				<span class='text'>A quarrel arose between Philip's aides and a papal legate, [[Bernard Saisset]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The legate was arrested on a charge of inciting an insurrection, was tried and convicted by the royal court, and committed to the custody of the archbishop of [[Narbonne]], Giles Aycelin - one of his key ministers and allies, in 1301</span>
				<span class='text'>In the bull ''[[Ausculta fili]]'' (&quot;Listen, son&quot;, December 1301) Boniface VIII appealed to Philip IV to listen modestly to the Vicar of Christ as the spiritual monarch over all earthly kings</span>
				<span class='text'>He protested against the trial of churchmen before Philip's royal courts and the continued use of church funds for state purposes and he announced he would summon the bishops and abbots of France to take measures &quot;for the preservation of the liberties of the Church&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In February 1302 the bull ''Ausculta fili'' was officially burned at Paris before King Philip and a great multitude</span>
				<span class='text'> Nonetheless, on 4 March 1302, Pope Boniface sent Cardinal [[Jean Lemoine|Jean Le Moine]] de Cressi, OSB, Cardinal Priest of SS</span>
				<span class='text'>Marcellinus and Petrus, as his Legate, to reassert papal control over the French clergy</span>

				<span class='text'>325-326</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  To forestall the ecclesiastical council proposed by Boniface, Philip summoned the three estates of his realm to meet at Paris in April</span>
				<span class='text'>At this first [[French States-General]] in history, all three classes – nobles, clergy, and commons – wrote separately to Rome in defense of the king and his temporal power</span>
				<span class='text'>Some forty-five French prelates, despite Philip's prohibition, and the confiscation of their property, attended the council at Rome in October 1302</span>

				<span class='text'>97-100</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Following that council, on 18 November 1302, Boniface issued the bull ''[[Unam sanctam]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>303-304</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; It declared that both spiritual and temporal power were under the pope's jurisdiction, and that kings were subordinate to the power of the Roman pontiff</span>
				<span class='text'> The Pope also appointed Cardinal Jean le Moine as Apostolic Legate to King Philip, to attempt to find some resolution of the impasse that had developed; he was granted the specific power of absolving King Philip from excommunication</span>

				<span class='text'>Among others, William of Nogaret, who had conducted the negotiations for the king of France, scorned him and threatened him, saying that he would take him bound to Lyons on the Rhone, and there in a general council would cause him to be deposed and condemned</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> no man dared to touch [Boniface], nor were they pleased to lay hands on him, but they left him robed under light arrest and were minded to rob the treasure of the Pope and the Church</span>

				<span class='text'>the grief which had hardened in the heart of Pope Boniface, by reason of the injury which he had received, produced in him, once he had come to Rome, a strange malady so that he gnawed at himself as if he were mad, and in this state he passed from this life on the twelfth day of October in the year of Christ 1303, and in the Church of St</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/blockquote&gt;He died of a violent fever, on 11 October, in full possession of his senses and in the presence of eight cardinals and the chief members of the papal household, after receiving the sacraments and making the usual profession of faith</span>
				<span class='text'>His life seemed destined to close in gloom, for, on account of an unusually violent storm, he was buried, says an old chronicler, with less decency than became a pope</span>
				<span class='text'>== Burial and exhumation ===The body of Boniface VIII was buried in 1303 in a special chapel that also housed the remains of [[Pope Boniface IV]] (A</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>608-615), which had been moved by Boniface VIII from a tomb outside the Vatican Basilica in the portico</span>
				<span class='text'>Boniface VIII had arranged that this would be done to offset the fact that his predecessor was still alive, which caused him to worry that the legitimacy of his own papacy would be thrown into doubt</span>
				<span class='text'> In choosing such a burial, Boniface VIII was trying to show that he was a legitimate pope with the implicit support from the grave of a popular predecessor, Boniface IV</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The body lay within three coffins, the outermost of wood, the middle of lead, and the innermost of [[pine]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The corporal remains were described as being &quot;unusually tall&quot; measuring seven [[hand (unit)|palms]] when examined by doctors</span>
				<span class='text'>The body was found quite intact, especially the shapely hands, thus disproving another calumny, viz</span>
				<span class='text'> that he had died in a frenzy, gnawing his hands, beating his brains out against the wall, and the like ([http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>The body wore ecclesiastical vestments common for Boniface's lifetime: long stockings covered legs and thighs, and it was garbed also with the [[maniple (vestment)|maniple]], [[soutain]], and pontifical habit made of black silk, as well as [[Stole (vestment)|stole]], [[chasuble]], rings, and bejeweled gloves</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;The body was seen several times by the Papal Master of Ceremonies, Giovanni Paolo Mucanzio, who reported the details in his ''Diary'', under 11 October 1605:  Joannes Baptista Gattico, ''Acta Selecta Caeremonialia Sanctae Romanae Ecclesiae ex variis mss</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;=== Posthumous trial ===After the papacy had been removed to [[Avignon]] in 1309, [[Pope Clement V]], under extreme pressure from King Philip IV, consented to a [[post-mortem trial]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He said that &quot;it was permissible for any persons who wanted to proceed against the memory of Boniface VIII to proceed</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;  He gave a mandate to the Bishop of Paris, Guillaume de Baufet d'Aurillac,  and to Guillaume Pierre Godin, OP, that the complainants should choose prosecutors and determine a day on which the Inquiry would begin in the presence of the Pope (''coram nobis Avinione'')</span>
				<span class='text'> The Pope signed his mandate at his current place of residence, the Priory of Grauselle&lt;ref&gt;''Gallia christiana'' I (Paris 1716), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>919-920</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; near Malusan (Malausène) in the diocese of Vasio (Vaison), on 18 October 1309</span>
				<span class='text'> Both the King of Aragon and the King of Castile immediately sent ambassadors to Pope Clement, complaining that scandal was being poured into the ears of the Faithful, when they heard that a Roman pontiff was being charged with a crime of heresy</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  They had a point, in that the persecution implied that a pope was not infallible in matters of faith and morals</span>
				<span class='text'> Complaints also came from Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands</span>
				<span class='text'> On 27 April 1310, in what was certainly a peace gesture toward the French, Clement V pardoned Guillaume Nogaret for his offenses committed at Anagni against Boniface VIII and the Church, for which he had been excommunicated, with the condition that Nogaret personally go to the Holy Land in the next wave of soldiers and serve there in the military</span>

				<span class='text'>495</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; By the end of Spring 1310, Clement was feeling the embarrassment and the pressure over the material being produced by Boniface's accusers</span>
				<span class='text'>His patience was wearing thin</span>
				<span class='text'>He issued a mandate on 28 June 1310, in which he complained about the quality of the testimony and the corruption of the various accusers and witnesses</span>
				<span class='text'> Then he ordered the Quaesitores that future examinations should proceed under threat of excommunication for perjury</span>

				<span class='text'>463-464</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  A process (judicial investigation) against the memory of Boniface was held by an ecclesiastical consistory at Groseau, near Avignon, which held preliminary examinations in August and September 1310</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Its records were  republished in a critical edition by Jean Coste, ''Boniface VIII en procès: articles d'accusation et dépositions des témoins (1303-1311)''  (Rome: 'L'Erma' di Bretschneider 1995)</span>
				<span class='text'> See especially pp</span>
				<span class='text'>547-732</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and collected testimonies that alleged many heretical opinions of Boniface VIII</span>
				<span class='text'>This included the offence of [[sodomy]], although there is no substantive evidence for this, and it is likely that this was the standard accusation Philip made against enemies</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;James Brundage, ''Law, Sex and Christianity in Medieval Europe'' (University of Chicago, 1990), p</span>
				<span class='text'>473&lt;/ref&gt;  The same charge was brought against the Templars</span>
				<span class='text'>efore the actual trial could be held, Clement persuaded Philip to leave the question of Boniface's guilt to the [[Council of Vienne]], which met in 1311</span>
				<span class='text'>On 27 April 1311, in a public Consistory, with King Philip's agents present, the Pope formally excused the King for everything that he had said against the memory of Pope Boniface, on the grounds that he was speaking with good intentions</span>
				<span class='text'>This statement was written down and published as a bull, and the bull contained the statement that the matter would be referred by the Pope to the forthcoming Council</span>
				<span class='text'>The Pope then announced that he was reserving the whole matter to his own judgment</span>

				<span class='text'>481-483</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  The XV Ecumenical Council, the Council of Vienne, opened on 1 November 1311, with more than 300 bishops in attendance</span>
				<span class='text'>When the Council met (so it is said), three cardinals appeared before it and testified to the orthodoxy and morality of the dead pope</span>
				<span class='text'>Two knights, as challengers, threw down their gauntlets to maintain his innocence by [[wager of battle]]</span>
				<span class='text'>No one accepted the challenge, and the Council declared the matter closed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''The Age of Faith'', Will Durant, 1950, 13th printing, page 816--but without citing a source</span>
				<span class='text'>Durant's authority is not high</span>
				<span class='text'>It seems quite unlikely that the Church, especially during an Ecumenical Council, would have acquiesced in a trial for heresy by combat--which was contrary to Church policy</span>
				<span class='text'> And there is evidence that a legal brief had been prepared by an eminent lawyer of Bologna for a trial of Boniface VIII at the Council: Joannes Dominicus Mansi, ''Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima Collectio'' novissima edition, Tomus vicesimus quintus (Venetiis 1782), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>415-426; it is pointed out in several places in the same work that the case of Boniface was presented to the Council by Pope Clement, and that the Council rejected it</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Clement's order disbanding the Order of the Knights Templar was signed at the Council of Vienne on 2 May 1312</span>
				<span class='text'>= Culture ==[[File:Opera del duomo (FI), arnolfo di cambio, Bonifacio VIII , 1298 circa, 03</span>
				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|Statue of Pope Boniface VIII at the [[Museo dell'Opera del Duomo (Florence)|Museo dell'Opera del Duomo]] in [[Florence]]]]* In his ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] portrayed Boniface VIII as destined for hell, where [[simony]] is punished, although Boniface was still alive at the fictional date of the poem's story</span>
				<span class='text'>Boniface's eventual destiny is revealed to Dante by [[Pope Nicholas III]], whom he meets</span>
				<span class='text'>A bit later in the Inferno, we are reminded of the pontiff's feud with the Colonna family, which led him to demolish the city of [[Palestrina]], killing 6,000 citizens and destroying both the home of [[Julius Caesar]] and a shrine to the [[BVM(RC)|Blessed Virgin Mary]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Boniface's ultimate fate is confirmed by Beatrice when Dante visits Heaven</span>
				<span class='text'>It is notable that he does not adopt Guillaume de Nogaret's aspersion that Boniface VIII was a 'sodomite', however, and does not assign him to that circle of hell (albeit that Simony was placed in the eighth circle of Fraud below Sodomy in the seventh circle of Violence, designating it as a worse offense and taking precedence above activities of sodomy)</span>
				<span class='text'> He is also referenced in [[François Rabelais]]'s ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>In the chapter where Epistemon is listing the inhabitants of hell and their occupations, he says that Boniface was (in one translation) &quot;skimming the scum off soup pots&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'> In [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio's]] ''[[The Decameron|Decameron]]'', Boniface VIII is [[satire|satirically]] depicted granting a [[highwayman]] ([[Ghino di Tacco]]) a priorate (Day 10, second tale)</span>
				<span class='text'>Earlier (I</span>
				<span class='text'>), Boniface VIII is also mentioned for his role in sending [[Charles of Valois]] to [[Florence]] in 1300 to end the feud between the Black and White [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelphs]]</span>
				<span class='text'> The Tale of Pope Boniface is told in Book 2 of [[John Gower]]'s ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'' as an ''exemplum'' of the sin of fraudulently supplanting others</span>
				<span class='text'>Gower claims that Boniface tricked Pope Celestine V into abdicating by having a young cleric, pretending to be the voice of God, speak to him while he was sleeping and convince him to abdicate (ll</span>
				<span class='text'>2861-2900)</span>
				<span class='text'>Gower also repeats the rumour that Boniface died by gnawing off his own hands, but attributes this to hunger rather than a deliberate suicide attempt (ll</span>

				<span class='text'> Boniface was a patron of [[Giotto di Bondone]]</span>
