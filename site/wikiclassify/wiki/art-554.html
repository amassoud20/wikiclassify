				<span class='text'>'' (February 13, 1910 – August 12, 1989) was an American physicist and inventor</span>
				<span class='text'>Shockley was the manager of a research group that included [[John Bardeen]] and [[Walter Houser Brattain|Walter Brattain]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The three scientists invented the [[point contact transistor]] in 1947 and were jointly awarded the 1956 [[Nobel Prize]] in Physics</span>
				<span class='text'>hockley's attempts to commercialize a new transistor design in the 1950s and 1960s led to California's &quot;[[Silicon Valley]]&quot; becoming a hotbed of electronics innovation</span>
				<span class='text'>In his later life, Shockley was a professor of [[electrical engineering]] at [[Stanford University]] and became a proponent of [[eugenics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimesobit&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PhysicsTodayobit&quot; /&gt;{{TOClimit|2}}==Early life and education==Shockley was born in [[London, England]], to American parents, and raised in his family's hometown of [[Palo Alto]], California, from age three</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;IREProceedings1952&quot; /&gt; His father, William Hillman Shockley, was a mining engineer who speculated in mines for a living, and spoke eight languages</span>
				<span class='text'>His mother, Mary (née Bradford), grew up in the American West, graduated from Stanford University, and became the first female US Deputy mining surveyor</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Shurkin2006p3&quot; /&gt;Shockley received his Bachelor of Science degree from [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]] in 1932</span>
				<span class='text'>Shockley received his Ph</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>degree from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] in 1936</span>
				<span class='text'>The title of his doctoral thesis was ''Electronic Bands in Sodium Chloride''</span>
				<span class='text'>His thesis topic was suggested by his thesis advisor, [[John C</span>
				<span class='text'>Slater]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Shurkin2006pp38–39&quot; /&gt; After receiving his doctorate, Shockley joined a research group headed by [[Clinton Davisson]] at [[Bell Labs]] in New Jersey</span>
				<span class='text'>The next few years were productive ones for Shockley</span>
				<span class='text'>He published a number of fundamental papers on solid state physics in [[Physical Review]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1938, he got his first patent, &quot;Electron Discharge Device&quot;, on [[electron multiplier]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Shurkin2006p48&quot; /&gt;==Career==When World War II broke out, Shockley became involved in [[radar]] research at the Bell labs in Manhattan, New York</span>
				<span class='text'>In May 1942, he took leave from Bell Labs to become a research director at Columbia University's Anti-Submarine Warfare Operations Group</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Broken Genius'' p</span>
				<span class='text'>65–67&lt;/ref&gt; This involved devising methods for countering the tactics of submarines with improved [[convoy]]ing techniques, optimizing [[depth charge]] patterns, and so on</span>
				<span class='text'>This project required frequent trips to the Pentagon and Washington, where Shockley met many high-ranking officers and government officials</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1944, he organized a training program for [[B-29]] bomber pilots to use new radar bomb sights</span>
				<span class='text'>In late 1944 he took a three-month tour to bases around the world to assess the results</span>
				<span class='text'>For this project, Secretary of War [[Robert Porter Patterson|Robert Patterson]] awarded Shockley the [[Medal for Merit]] on October 17, 1946</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Shurkin2006p85&quot; /&gt;In July 1945, the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] asked Shockley to prepare a report on the question of probable casualties from an invasion of the Japanese mainland</span>
				<span class='text'>Shockley concluded:{{quote|If the study shows that the behavior of nations in all historical cases comparable to Japan's has in fact been invariably consistent with the behavior of the troops in battle, then it means that the Japanese dead and ineffectives at the time of the defeat will exceed the corresponding number for the Germans</span>
				<span class='text'>In other words, we shall probably have to kill at least 5 to 10 million Japanese</span>
				<span class='text'>This might cost us between 1</span>
				<span class='text'> and 4 million casualties including 400,000 to 800,000 killed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Giangreco1997&quot; /&gt;}}This report influenced the decision for the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] to force Japan to surrender without an invasion</span>

				<span class='text'>133&lt;/ref&gt;===Development of the transistor===Shortly after the end of the war in 1945, Bell Labs formed a solid state physics group, led by Shockley and chemist Stanley Morgan, which included [[John Bardeen]], [[Walter Brattain]], physicist [[Gerald Pearson]], chemist Robert Gibney, electronics expert Hilbert Moore, and several technicians</span>
				<span class='text'>Their assignment was to seek a solid-state alternative to fragile glass [[vacuum tube]] amplifiers</span>
				<span class='text'>Its first attempts were based on Shockley's ideas about using an external electrical field on a semiconductor to affect its conductivity</span>
				<span class='text'>These experiments failed every time in all sorts of configurations and materials</span>
				<span class='text'>The group was at a standstill until Bardeen suggested a theory that invoked [[surface states]] that prevented the field from penetrating the semiconductor</span>
				<span class='text'>The group changed its focus to study these surface states and they met almost daily to discuss the work</span>
				<span class='text'>The rapport of the group was excellent, and ideas were freely exchanged</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Brattain quoted in ''Crystal Fire'' p</span>
				<span class='text'>127&lt;/ref&gt;By the winter of 1946 they had enough results that Bardeen submitted a paper on the surface states to ''[[Physical Review]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Brattain started experiments to study the surface states through observations made while shining a bright light on the semiconductor's surface</span>
				<span class='text'>This led to several more papers (one of them co-authored with Shockley), which estimated the density of the surface states to be more than enough to account for their failed experiments</span>
				<span class='text'>The pace of the work picked up significantly when they started to surround point contacts between the semiconductor and the conducting wires with [[electrolyte]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>Moore built a circuit that allowed them to vary the frequency of the input signal easily</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally they began to get some evidence of power amplification when Pearson, acting on a suggestion by Shockley, put a voltage on a droplet of glycol borate (a viscous chemical that did not evaporate, commonly used in electrolytic capacitors, and obtained by puncturing an example capacitor with a nail, using a hammer) placed across a [[P-N junction]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Three others (submitted first) covered the electrolyte-based transistors with Bardeen, Gibney and Brattain as the inventors</span>
				<span class='text'>Shockley's name was not on any of these patent applications</span>

				<span class='text'>The point contact transistor, he believed, would prove to be fragile and difficult to manufacture</span>
				<span class='text'>Shockley was also dissatisfied with certain parts of the explanation for how the point contact transistor worked and conceived of the possibility of [[minority carrier]] injection</span>
