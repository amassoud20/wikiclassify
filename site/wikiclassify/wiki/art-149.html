				<span class='text'>vg}}'''Edgar Allan Poe''' ({{IPAc-en|p|oʊ}}; born '''Edgar Poe'''; January 19, 1809&amp;nbsp;– October 7, 1849) was an American writer, editor, and [[Literary criticism|literary critic]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Poe is best known for his poetry and short stories, particularly his tales of [[Mystery (fiction)|mystery]] and the [[macabre]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Widely regarded as a central figure of [[Romanticism]] in the United States and American literature as a whole, he was one of the country's earliest practitioners of the short story</span>
				<span class='text'>Poe is generally considered the inventor of the [[detective fiction]] genre and is further credited with contributing to the emerging genre of [[science fiction]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stableford|2003|pp=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first well-known American writer to try to earn a living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = Meyers138/&gt;Born in [[Boston]], Poe was the second child of two actors</span>
				<span class='text'>His father abandoned the family in 1810, and his mother died the following year</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus orphaned, the child was taken in by John and Frances Allan, of [[Richmond, Virginia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Although they never formally adopted him, Poe was with them well into young adulthood</span>
				<span class='text'>Tension developed later as John Allan and Edgar repeatedly clashed over debts, including those incurred by gambling, and the cost of secondary education for the young man</span>
				<span class='text'>Poe attended the [[University of Virginia]] for one semester but left due to lack of money</span>
				<span class='text'>Poe quarreled with Allan over the funds for his education and enlisted in the Army in 1827 under an assumed name</span>
				<span class='text'>It was at this time his publishing career began, albeit humbly, with an anonymous collection of poems, ''[[Tamerlane and Other Poems]]'' (1827), credited only to &quot;a Bostonian&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>With the death of Frances Allan in 1829, Poe and Allan reached a temporary rapprochement</span>
				<span class='text'>Later failing as an officer's cadet at [[West Point]] and declaring a firm wish to be a poet and writer, Poe parted ways with John Allan</span>
				<span class='text'>oe switched his focus to prose and spent the next several years working for literary journals and periodicals, becoming known for his own style of literary criticism</span>
				<span class='text'>His work forced him to move among several cities, including [[Baltimore]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[New York City]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In Baltimore in 1835, he married [[Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe|Virginia Clemm]], his 13-year-old cousin</span>
				<span class='text'>In January 1845 Poe published his poem, &quot;[[The Raven]]&quot;, to instant success</span>
				<span class='text'>His wife died of [[tuberculosis]] two years after its publication</span>
				<span class='text'>For years, he had been planning to produce his own journal, ''The Penn'' (later renamed ''[[The Stylus]]''), though he died before it could be produced</span>
				<span class='text'>On October 7, 1849, at age 40, Poe died in Baltimore; the cause of his death is unknown and has been variously attributed to alcohol, brain congestion, [[cholera]], drugs, heart disease, [[rabies]], suicide, tuberculosis, and other agents</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Meyers256&quot;/&gt;Poe and his works influenced literature in the United States and around the world, as well as in specialized fields, such as [[cosmology]] and [[cryptography]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Poe and his work appear throughout popular culture in literature, music, films, and television</span>
				<span class='text'>A number of his homes are dedicated museums today</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Mystery Writers of America]] present an annual award known as the [[Edgar Award]] for distinguished work in the mystery genre</span>

				<span class='text'>]He was born Edgar Poe in [[Boston]], on January 19, 1809, the second child of English-born actress [[Eliza Poe|Elizabeth Arnold Hopkins Poe]] and actor [[David Poe, Jr</span>
				<span class='text'>] He had an elder brother, [[William Henry Leonard Poe]], and a younger sister, Rosalie Poe</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Allen&gt;{{harvnb|Allen|1927|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their grandfather, David Poe, Sr</span>
				<span class='text'> had emigrated from [[County Cavan|Cavan]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], to America around the year 1750</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quinn|1998|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edgar may have been named after a character in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[King Lear]]'', a play the couple was performing in 1809</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nelson|1981|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father abandoned their family in 1810,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Canada|1997|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his mother died a year later from consumption ([[pulmonary tuberculosis]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Poe was then taken into the home of John Allan, a successful Scottish merchant in [[Richmond, Virginia]], who dealt in a variety of goods including tobacco, cloth, wheat, tombstones, and [[slavery|slaves]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Allans served as a foster family and gave him the name &quot;Edgar Allan Poe&quot;,&lt;ref name=Meyers9&gt;{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; though they never formally adopted him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quinn|1998|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;The Allan family had Poe baptized in the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]] in 1812</span>
				<span class='text'>John Allan alternately spoiled and aggressively disciplined his foster son</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Meyers9/&gt; The family, including Poe and Allan's wife, Frances Valentine Allan, sailed to Britain in 1815</span>
				<span class='text'>Poe attended the grammar school in [[Irvine, North Ayrshire|Irvine]], Scotland (where John Allan was born) for a short period in 1815, before rejoining the family in London in 1816</span>
				<span class='text'>There he studied at a boarding school in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] until summer 1817</span>
				<span class='text'>He was subsequently entered at the Reverend John Bransby's Manor House School at [[Stoke Newington]], then a suburb {{convert|4|mi|km}} north of London</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|pp=16–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;Poe moved back with the Allans to Richmond, Virginia in 1820</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1824 Poe served as the lieutenant of the Richmond youth honor guard as Richmond [[Visit of the Marquis de Lafayette to the United States|celebrated the visit of the Marquis de Lafayette]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|PoeMuseum</span>
				<span class='text'>rg|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1825, John Allan's uncle&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and business benefactor William Galt, said to be one of the wealthiest men in Richmond, died and left Allan several acres of real estate</span>
				<span class='text'>The inheritance was estimated at $750,000</span>
				<span class='text'>By summer 1825, Allan celebrated his expansive wealth by purchasing a two-story brick home named Moldavia</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|pp=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;Poe may have become engaged to [[Sarah Elmira Royster]] before he registered at the one-year-old [[University of Virginia]] in February 1826 to study ancient and modern languages</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|pp=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;University of Virginia</span>

				<span class='text'>10&lt;/ref&gt; The university, in its infancy, was established on the ideals of its founder, [[Thomas Jefferson]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It had strict rules against gambling, horses, guns, tobacco and alcohol, but these rules were generally ignored</span>
				<span class='text'>Jefferson had enacted a system of student self-government, allowing students to choose their own studies, make their own arrangements for boarding, and report all wrongdoing to the faculty</span>
				<span class='text'>The unique system was still in chaos, and there was a high dropout rate</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|pp=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time there, Poe lost touch with Royster and also became estranged from his foster father over gambling debts</span>
				<span class='text'>Poe claimed that Allan had not given him sufficient money to register for classes, purchase texts, and procure and furnish a dormitory</span>
				<span class='text'>Allan did send additional money and clothes, but Poe's debts increased</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|pp=32–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poe gave up on the university after a year, and, not feeling welcome in Richmond, especially when he learned that his sweetheart Royster had married Alexander Shelton, he traveled to Boston in April 1827, sustaining himself with odd jobs as a clerk and newspaper writer</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Meyers32&gt;{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; At some point he started using the pseudonym Henri Le Rennet</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;===Military career===[[File:FtIndependence2</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|left|thumb|Poe was first stationed at Boston's [[Fort Independence (Massachusetts)|Fort Independence]] while in the army</span>
				<span class='text'>]Unable to support himself, on May 27, 1827, Poe enlisted in the [[United States Army]] as a private</span>
				<span class='text'>Using the name &quot;Edgar A</span>
				<span class='text'>Perry&quot;, he claimed he was {{nowrap|22 years old}} even though he was 18</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cornelius|2002|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He first served at [[Fort Independence (Massachusetts)|Fort Independence]] in [[Boston Harbor]] for five&amp;nbsp;dollars a month</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Meyers32/&gt; That same year, he released his first book, a 40-page collection of poetry, ''[[Tamerlane and Other Poems]]'', attributed with the byline &quot;by a Bostonian&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Only 50&amp;nbsp;copies were printed, and the book received virtually no attention</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|pp=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poe's regiment was posted to [[Fort Moultrie]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina]] and traveled by ship on the brig ''Waltham'' on November 8, 1827</span>
				<span class='text'>Poe was promoted to &quot;artificer&quot;, an enlisted tradesman who prepared shells for [[artillery]], and had his monthly pay doubled</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; After serving for two&amp;nbsp;years and attaining the rank of Sergeant Major for Artillery (the highest rank a noncommissioned officer can achieve), Poe sought to end his five-year enlistment early</span>
				<span class='text'>He revealed his real name and his circumstances to his commanding officer, Lieutenant Howard</span>
				<span class='text'>Howard would only allow Poe to be [[military discharge|discharged]] if he reconciled with John Allan and wrote a letter to Allan, who was unsympathetic</span>
				<span class='text'>Several months passed and pleas to Allan were ignored; Allan may not have written to Poe even to make him aware of his foster mother's illness</span>
				<span class='text'>Frances Allan died on February 28, 1829, and Poe visited the day after her burial</span>
				<span class='text'>Perhaps softened by his wife's death, John Allan agreed to support Poe's attempt to be discharged in order to receive an appointment to the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|pp=43–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;Poe finally was discharged on April 15, 1829, after securing a replacement to finish his enlisted term for him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before entering West Point, Poe moved back to Baltimore for a time, to stay with his widowed aunt Maria Clemm, her daughter, [[Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe|Virginia Eliza Clemm]] (Poe's first cousin), his brother Henry, and his invalid grandmother Elizabeth Cairnes Poe</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cornelius|2002|pp=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Poe published his second book, ''Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane and Minor Poems'', in Baltimore in 1829</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sova|2001|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;Poe traveled to West Point and matriculated as a cadet on July 1, 1830</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krutch|1926|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1830, John Allan married his second wife, Louisa Patterson</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cornelius|2002|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage, and bitter quarrels with Poe over the children born to Allan out of affairs, led to the foster father finally disowning Poe</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|pp=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poe decided to leave West Point by purposely getting [[court-martial]]ed</span>
				<span class='text'>On February 8, 1831, he was tried for gross neglect of duty and disobedience of orders for refusing to attend formations, classes, or church</span>
				<span class='text'>Poe tactically pled not guilty to induce dismissal, knowing he would be found guilty</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hecker|2005|pp=49–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;He left for New York in February 1831, and released a third volume of poems, simply titled ''Poems</span>
				<span class='text'>' The book was financed with help from his fellow cadets at West Point, many of whom donated 75&amp;nbsp;cents to the cause, raising a total of $170</span>
				<span class='text'>They may have been expecting verses similar to the satirical ones Poe had been writing about commanding officers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|pp=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Printed by Elam Bliss of New York, it was labeled as &quot;Second Edition&quot; and included a page saying, &quot;To the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Corps of Cadets this volume is respectfully dedicated</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The book once again reprinted the long poems &quot;Tamerlane&quot; and &quot;Al Aaraaf&quot; but also six previously unpublished poems including early versions of &quot;[[To Helen]]&quot;, &quot;[[Poems by Edgar Allan Poe#Israfel (1831)|Israfel]]&quot;, and &quot;[[The City in the Sea]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hecker|2005|pp=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Baltimore, to his aunt, brother and cousin, in March 1831</span>
				<span class='text'>His elder brother Henry, who had been in ill health in part due to problems with alcoholism, died on August 1, 1831</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quinn|1998|pp=187–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;===Publishing career===After his brother's death, Poe began more earnest attempts to start his career as a writer</span>
				<span class='text'>He chose a difficult time in American publishing to do so</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whalen|2001|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first well-known American to try to live by writing alone&lt;ref name=Meyers138&gt;{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Quinn305&gt;{{harvnb|Quinn|1998|p=305}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was hampered by the lack of an [[International copyright agreements|international]] [[copyright]] law</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|p=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publishers often pirated copies of British works rather than paying for new work by Americans</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Quinn305/&gt; The industry was also particularly hurt by the [[Panic of 1837]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whalen|2001|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a booming growth in American periodicals around this time period, fueled in part by new technology, many did not last beyond a few issues&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; and publishers often refused to pay their writers or paid them much later than they promised</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whalen|2001|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poe, throughout his attempts to live as a writer, repeatedly had to resort to humiliating pleas for money and other assistance</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:VirginiaPoe</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|right|thumb|upright|In 1835, Poe, then 26, married his 13-year-old cousin, [[Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe|Virginia Clemm]]</span>
				<span class='text'>They were married for eleven years until her early death, which may have inspired some of his writing</span>
				<span class='text'>]After his early attempts at poetry, Poe had turned his attention to prose</span>
				<span class='text'>He placed a few stories with a [[Philadelphia]] publication and began work on his only drama, ''[[Politian (play)|Politian]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''[[Baltimore Saturday Visiter]]'' awarded Poe a prize in October 1833 for his short story &quot;[[MS</span>
				<span class='text'>Found in a Bottle]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sova|2001|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story brought him to the attention of [[John P</span>
				<span class='text'>Kennedy]], a Baltimorean of considerable means</span>
				<span class='text'>He helped Poe place some of his stories, and introduced him to Thomas W</span>
				<span class='text'>White, editor of the ''[[Southern Literary Messenger]]'' in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Poe became assistant editor of the periodical in August 1835,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sova|2001|p=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was discharged within a few weeks for having been caught drunk by his boss</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to Baltimore, Poe secretly married Virginia, his cousin, on September 22, 1835</span>
				<span class='text'>He was 26 and she was 13, though she is listed on the marriage certificate as being 21</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reinstated by White after promising good behavior, Poe went back to Richmond with Virginia and her mother</span>
				<span class='text'>He remained at the ''Messenger'' until January 1837</span>
				<span class='text'>During this period, Poe claimed that its circulation increased from 700 to 3,500</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Allen/&gt; He published several poems, book reviews, critiques, and stories in the paper</span>
				<span class='text'>On May 16, 1836, he had a second wedding ceremony in Richmond with Virginia Clemm, this time in public</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;''[[The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket]]'' was published and widely reviewed in 1838</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1839, Poe became assistant editor of ''[[Burton's Gentleman's Magazine]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>He published numerous articles, stories, and reviews, enhancing his reputation as a trenchant critic that he had established at the ''Southern Literary Messenger''</span>
				<span class='text'>Also in 1839, the collection ''[[Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque]]'' was published in two&amp;nbsp;volumes, though he made little money off of it and it received mixed reviews</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poe left ''Burton's'' after about a year and found a position as assistant at ''[[Graham's Magazine]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sova|2001|pp=39, 99}}&lt;/ref&gt;In June 1840, Poe published a prospectus announcing his intentions to start his own journal, ''[[The Stylus]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, Poe intended to call the journal ''The Penn'', as it would have been based in Philadelphia</span>
				<span class='text'>In the June 6, 1840 issue of Philadelphia's ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'', Poe bought advertising space for his prospectus: ''&quot;Prospectus of the Penn Magazine, a Monthly Literary journal to be edited and published in the city of Philadelphia by Edgar A</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journal was never produced before Poe's death</span>
				<span class='text'>Around this time, he attempted to secure a position with the [[John Tyler|Tyler]] administration, claiming he was a member of the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quinn|1998|pp=321–322}}&lt;/ref&gt; He hoped to be appointed to the [[Custom House]] in Philadelphia with help from president Tyler's son Robert,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|p=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; an acquaintance of Poe's friend Frederick Thomas</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poe failed to show up for a meeting with Thomas to discuss the appointment in mid-September 1842, claiming to have been sick, though Thomas believed he had been drunk</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though he was promised an appointment, all positions were filled by others</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;Beyond horror, Poe also wrote satires, humor tales, and [[hoax]]es</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fisher|1993|pp=142,149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poe also reinvented science fiction, responding in his writing to emerging technologies such as [[hot air balloon]]s in &quot;[[The Balloon-Hoax]]&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Works with obvious meanings, he wrote, cease to be art</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilbur|1967|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that work of quality should be brief and focus on a specific single effect</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jannaccone|1974|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;In &quot;[[The Philosophy of Composition]]&quot;, an essay in which Poe describes his method in writing &quot;The Raven&quot;, he claims to have strictly followed this method</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|New York Times|1894}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aldous Huxley]] wrote that Poe's writing &quot;falls into vulgarity&quot; by being &quot;too poetical&quot;—the equivalent of wearing a diamond ring on every finger</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Huxley|1967|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;It is believed that only 12 copies of Poe's first book, ''Tamerlane and Other Poems'', have survived</span>

				<span class='text'>His keen analytical abilities, which were so evident in his detective stories, allowed him to see that the general public was largely ignorant of the methods by which a simple substitution cryptogram can be solved, and he used this to his advantage</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Silverman152/&gt; The sensation Poe created with his cryptography stunts played a major role in popularizing cryptograms in newspapers and magazines</span>

				<span class='text'>As the tradition carried on for more than 60&amp;nbsp;years, it is likely that the &quot;Poe Toaster&quot; was actually more than one individual, though the tribute was always the same</span>
				<span class='text'>Every January 19, in the early hours of the morning, the person made a toast of [[Cognac (drink)|cognac]] to Poe's original grave marker and left three [[rose]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>Members of the Edgar Allan Poe Society in Baltimore helped protect this tradition for decades</span>
				<span class='text'>n August 15, 2007, Sam Porpora, a former historian at the Westminster Church in Baltimore where Poe is buried, claimed that he had started the tradition</span>
				<span class='text'>Porpora said that the tradition began in 1949 in order to raise money and enhance the profile of the church</span>
