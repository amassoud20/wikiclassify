				<span class='text'>7 of the book</span>
				<span class='text'>The concert was in 1954 at Palo Alto High School</span>
				<span class='text'>It was a fundraiser for the California Democratic Party</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--EDITOR NOTE: The sentence of this Wikipedia article that I am replacing (on January 5, 2014) with the sentence to which this footnote applies states mistakenly that Baez was eight years old when she went to that Pete Seeger concert</span>

				<span class='text'>emocracynow</span>
				<span class='text'>rg/2009/5/4/legendary_folk_singer_activist_pete_seeger&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'>If you read the paragraph at that webpage that mentions going to Seeger's concert and the paragraph after it, you will see why the inference that Baez was eight at the time is a mistake</span>
				<span class='text'>--&gt; She soon began practicing the songs of his [[Musical repertoire|repertoire]] and performing them publicly</span>
				<span class='text'>One of her very earliest public performances was at a retreat in [[Saratoga, California]], for a youth group from Temple Beth Jacob, a [[Redwood City, California]], congregation</span>
				<span class='text'>A few years later in 1957, Baez bought her first [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] [[acoustic guitar]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==College music scene in Massachusetts===In 1958, her father accepted a faculty position at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], and moved his family to Massachusetts</span>
				<span class='text'>That time was in the center of the up-and-coming folk-music scene, and Baez began performing near home in Boston and nearby [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]]</span>
				<span class='text'>She also performed in clubs, and attended [[Boston University]] for about six weeks</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;American Masters&quot; /&gt; In 1958, at the [[Club Passim|Club 47]] in Cambridge, she gave her first concert</span>
				<span class='text'>When designing the poster for the performance, Baez considered changing her performing name to either Rachel Sandperl, the [[surname]] of her long-time mentor, Ira Sandperl, or Maria from the song &quot;[[They Call the Wind Maria]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>She later opted against doing so, fearing that people would accuse her of changing her last name because it was Spanish</span>
				<span class='text'>The audience consisted of her parents, her sister Mimi, her boyfriend, and a small group of friends, resulting in a total of eight patrons</span>
				<span class='text'>She was paid ten dollars</span>
				<span class='text'>Baez was later asked back and began performing twice a week for $25 per show</span>

				<span class='text'>]Her true professional career began at the 1959 Newport Folk Festival</span>
				<span class='text'>Following that appearance, she recorded her first album for Vanguard, ''[[Joan Baez (album)|Joan Baez]]'' (1960), produced by [[Fred Hellerman]] of [[The Weavers]], who produced many albums by folk artists</span>
				<span class='text'>The collection of traditional folk [[Ballad (music)|ballads]], blues and [[lament]]s sung to her own guitar accompaniment sold moderately well</span>
				<span class='text'>It featured many popular [[Child Ballads]] of the day, such as &quot;[[Mary Hamilton]]&quot; and was recorded in only four days in the ballroom of New York City's Manhattan Towers Hotel</span>
				<span class='text'>The album also included &quot;[[Gracias a la Vida (album)#Track listing|El Preso Numero Nueve]]&quot;, a song sung entirely in Spanish</span>
				<span class='text'>(She would rerecord the later song in 1974 for inclusion on her Spanish-language album, ''[[Gracias a la Vida (album)|Gracias a la Vida]]'')Her second release, ''[[Joan Baez, Vol</span>

				<span class='text'>Like its immediate predecessor, ''Joan Baez, Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>2'' contained strictly traditional material</span>
				<span class='text'>Her two albums of live material, ''Joan Baez in Concert, Part 1'' and its second counterpart, were unique in that, unlike most live albums, they contained only new songs, rather than established favorites</span>
				<span class='text'>It was ''Joan Baez in Concert, Part 2'' that featured Baez's first-ever Dylan cover</span>
				<span class='text'>rom the early-to-mid-1960s, Baez emerged at the forefront of the American [[roots revival]], where she introduced her audiences to the then-unknown Bob Dylan, and was emulated by artists such as [[Judy Collins]], [[Emmylou Harris]],  [[Joni Mitchell]], and [[Bonnie Raitt]]</span>
				<span class='text'>On November 23, 1962, Baez appeared on the cover of ''Time Magazine''—a rare honor then for a musician</span>
				<span class='text'>hough primarily an album artist, several of Baez' singles have charted, the first being her 1965 cover of [[Phil Ochs]]' &quot;There but for Fortune&quot;, which became a mid-level chart hit in the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>and a top-ten single in the United Kingdom</span>
				<span class='text'>aez added other instruments to her recordings on ''[[Farewell, Angelina]]'' (1965), which features several Dylan songs interspersed with more traditional fare</span>
				<span class='text'>eciding to experiment after having exhausted the folksinger-with-guitar format, Baez turned to [[Peter Schickele]], a [[classical music]] [[composer]], who provided classical orchestration for her next three albums: ''[[Noël (Joan Baez album)|Noël]]'' (1966), ''[[Joan (album)|Joan]]'' (1967) and ''[[Baptism: A Journey Through Our Time]]'' (1968)</span>
				<span class='text'>''Noël'' was a [[Christmas]] album of traditional material, while ''Baptism'' was akin to a [[concept album]], featuring Baez reading and singing [[poetry|poems]] written by celebrated poets such as [[James Joyce]], [[Federico García Lorca]] and [[Walt Whitman]]</span>
				<span class='text'>''Joan'' featured interpretations of work by then-contemporary composers, including [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]], [[Tim Hardin]], [[Paul Simon]] and [[Donovan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1968, Baez traveled to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where a marathon recording session resulted in two albums</span>
				<span class='text'> The first, ''[[Any Day Now (Joan Baez album)|Any Day Now]]'' (1968), consists exclusively of Dylan covers</span>
				<span class='text'>The other, the country-music-infused ''[[David's Album]]'' (1969) was recorded for then-husband [[David Harris (protester)|David Harris]], a prominent anti-[[Vietnam War]] protester eventually imprisoned for [[draft resistance]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Harris, a country-music fan, turned Baez toward more complex [[country rock|country-rock]] influences beginning with  ''David's Album''</span>
				<span class='text'>ater in 1968, she  published her first [[memoir]], ''Daybreak'' (by [[Dial Press]])</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1969, her appearance at Woodstock in upstate New York afforded her an international musical and political podium, particularly upon the successful release of the [[documentary film]] ''[[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock]]'' (1970)</span>
				<span class='text'>eginning in the late 1960s, Baez began writing many of her own songs, beginning with &quot;Sweet Sir Galahad&quot; and &quot;A Song For David,&quot; both songs appearing on her 1970 ''[[(I Live) One Day at a Time]]'' album; &quot;Sweet Sir Galahad&quot; was written about her sister Mimi's second marriage, while &quot;A Song For David&quot; was a tribute to Harris</span>
				<span class='text'>''One Day at a Time'', like ''David's Album'', featured a decidedly country sound</span>
				<span class='text'>aez's distinctive vocal style and political activism had a significant impact on popular music</span>
				<span class='text'>She was one of the first musicians to use her popularity as a vehicle for social protest, singing and marching for human rights and peace</span>

				<span class='text'>At the time, Baez had already released her debut album and her popularity as the emerging &quot;Queen of Folk&quot; was on the rise</span>
				<span class='text'>Baez was initially unimpressed with the &quot;urban [[hillbilly]]&quot;, but was impressed with one of Dylan's first compositions, &quot;[[Song to Woody]]&quot;, and remarked that she would like to record it</span>

				<span class='text'>Baez appeared with Dylan in the one hour [[television|TV]] special ''Hard Rain'', filmed at [[Fort Collins]], [[Colorado]], in May 1976</span>
