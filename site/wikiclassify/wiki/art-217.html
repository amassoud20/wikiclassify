				<span class='text'>vg}}'''George Bernard Shaw''' (26 July 1856{{spaced ndash}}2 November 1950) was a Nobel Prize and Oscar-winning Irish [[playwright]], critic and socialist whose influence on Western theatre, culture and politics stretched from the 1880s to his death in 1950</span>
				<span class='text'>Originally earning his way as an influential London music and theatre critic, Shaw's greatest gift was for the modern [[drama]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Strongly influenced by [[Henrik Ibsen]], he successfully introduced a new realism into English-language drama</span>
				<span class='text'> He wrote more than 60 plays, among them ''[[Man and Superman]]'', ''[[Mrs</span>
				<span class='text'>Warren's Profession]]'', ''[[Major Barbara]]'', ''[[Saint Joan (play)|Saint Joan]]'', ''[[Caesar and Cleopatra (play)|Caesar and Cleopatra]]'', and ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]''</span>
				<span class='text'> With his range from biting contemporary satire to historical allegory, Shaw became the leading comedy dramatist of his generation and one of the most important playwrights in the English language since the 17th century</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;Shaw was also the most trenchant pamphleteer since Swift, the most readable music critic in English, the best theatre critic of his generation, a prodigious lecturer and essayist on politics, economics, and sociological subjects, and one of the most prolific letter writers in literature,&quot; sums up [[Stanley Weintraub]] in the Encyclopædia Britannica</span>

				<span class='text'>om/biography/George-Bernard-Shaw|title=George Bernard Shaw|work=Encyclopedia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] in 1925</span>
				<span class='text'>s a young man raised in poverty, Shaw embraced [[socialism]] and became an early and lifelong force in the [[Fabian Society]], a highly influential British organisation, founded in 1884, to promote a gradual, as opposed to revolutionary, socialism, that was the foundation for the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in 1900</span>
				<span class='text'>He tirelessly wrote and spoke on behalf of its wide-ranging vision to transform British society, advocating a minimum wage for the working-class, universal healthcare, women's right to vote, and the abolition of hereditary privilege</span>
				<span class='text'>Not quite a pacifist because he justified war when a necessary evil (as in fighting the Nazis in WWII), he worked for a peaceable world and supported the establishment of the League of Nations</span>
				<span class='text'> He edited the classic text &quot;Fabian Essays in Socialism&quot; (1889), and helped co-founders Sidney and Beatrice Webb create the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]] from a bequest by an early Fabian in 1895</span>
				<span class='text'> He publicly opposed Britain's entry into both World Wars</span>
				<span class='text'>e is the [[List of Academy Award records#Miscellaneous records|only person to have been awarded both]] a [[Nobel Prize]] (Literature, 1925) and an [[Academy Award]] ([[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], 1938), the first for his contributions to literature and the second for his film adaptation of his most popular play, ''[[Pygmalion (1938 film)|Pygmalion]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>He harboured a lifelong animosity toward schools and teachers, saying, &quot;Schools and schoolmasters, as we have them today, are not popular as places of education and teachers, but rather prisons and turnkeys in which children are kept to prevent them disturbing and chaperoning their parents</span>

				<span class='text'>t was the Scottish theatre critic for the London World, William Archer, an early supporter of Ibsen and other modernists, who got Shaw his first paying gigs as a critic under his own byline</span>
				<span class='text'>By the second half of the 1880s, Shaw was self-supporting and gaining respect for his music reviews</span>
				<span class='text'>When he graduated to theatre critic at the Saturday Review, his acerbic wit and advocacy of modern standards for theatre impressed sophisticated London readers</span>
				<span class='text'>It was in this new environment, in the dawn of a new century, that Shaw finally abandoned novels and began his first play</span>
				<span class='text'>==Plays===What would become Shaw's first complete and produced play, ''[[Widowers' Houses]]'', began in collaboration with the theatre critic [[William Archer (critic)|William Archer]], who had given him his first real break as a theatre critic, but who soon left the project, never to broach playwriting again</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=November 2015}}Shaw didn't resume work on it until the powerful impact of Henrik Ibsen's new masterpieces arriving on the London stage in translation in 1890: first, ''[[A Doll's House]]'', then ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'',  It was while preparing to publish his essays on ''[[Quintessence of Ibsenism|The Quintessence of Ibsenism]]'' (1891) that Shaw decided to try to finish this first play on his own</span>
				<span class='text'> He completed it in 1892, and it was produced that same year</span>
				<span class='text'> ''[[Widowers' Houses]]'', a scathing attack on slum landlords, was first performed at London's Royalty Theatre on 9 December 1892</span>
				<span class='text'>The play eschewed the weary romantic cliches still dominating London theatre,  ironically exposing the well-meaning hero's horror as he discovered his dependence on the exploitation of the poor for his own private income and his father-in-law's prospective fortune</span>
				<span class='text'> Though in later years, Shaw dismissed it as &quot;his worst play,&quot;  his path was clear</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=November 2015}}After writing ''[[The Philanderer]]'', a look at love and marriage, Shaw created ''[[Mrs</span>
				<span class='text'>Warren's Profession]]'', his most explosive piece yet</span>
				<span class='text'> Mrs</span>
				<span class='text'>Warren's profession is prostitution</span>
				<span class='text'> Though completed in 1893, it was not performed in London until privately produced in 1902 and not publicly performed until 1925, because the British theatrical censor, the Lord Chamberlain, refused it a licence</span>
				<span class='text'>Shaw said he wrote the play &quot;to draw attention to the truth that prostitution is caused, not by female depravity and male licentiousness, but simply by underpaying, undervaluing and overworking women so shamefully that the poorest of them are forced to resort to prostitution to keep body and soul together</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Not having made any money with his &quot;unpleasant&quot;—as he termed them—first three plays, Shaw turned his hand to what he called &quot;pleasant&quot; fare</span>
				<span class='text'>These works include ''[[Arms and the Man]]'' (1894), a lighthearted, though prescient, attack on false patriotism in a Balkan setting, ''[[Candida (play)|Candida]]'' (1894), whose female protagonist must choose between her stolid Christian husband and a poet who's madly in love with her, and ''[[You Never Can Tell (play)|You Never Can Tell]]'' (1897), a farcical look at modern ideas of love</span>
				<span class='text'> By now, Shaw had mastered a tone of ironic detachment that wrapped his social exposes in mordant, entertaining wit</span>
				<span class='text'>He still had trouble establishing himself in England as a playwright, however, and often his work saw productions in the United States and Germany before being performed in London</span>
				<span class='text'> His first significant financial success came from [[Richard Mansfield]]'s American production of ''[[The Devil's Disciple]]'' (1897), set in New Hampshire during the American revolution</span>

				<span class='text'>In the [[Queen Victoria|Victorian Era]], the London stage had been regarded as a place for frothy, sentimental entertainment</span>
				<span class='text'>Shaw, indebted to [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s acerbic, pioneering modern realism, used the stage to probe for moral, political and economic truths</span>
				<span class='text'>But it was his irresistible ability to make such insights palatable that made him great</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=November 2015}}As Shaw's experience and popularity increased, his plays and often-lengthy prefaces (written for published versions of his plays) became more voluble about reforms he advocated, without diminishing their success as entertainments</span>
				<span class='text'>Such works include ''[[Caesar and Cleopatra (play)|Caesar and Cleopatra]]'' (1898), where Caesar is portrayed as a credible, moral man rather than a legend, and ''[[Man and Superman]]'' (1903), which expounds Shaw's philosophy of the &quot;Life Force&quot; forever pulling humanity forward</span>
				<span class='text'> The latter play includes in its lengthy third act the &quot;Don Juan In Hell&quot; sequence, which is often performed separately</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=November 2015}}From 1904 to 1907, several of his plays had their London premieres at the [[Royal Court Theatre]], managed by [[Harley Granville-Barker]] and [[J</span>
				<span class='text'>E</span>
				<span class='text'>Vedrenne]] who had first banded together to present his ''Candida'' in 1904</span>
				<span class='text'> His British reputation was made during a Royal Court production of what is today a lesser-known work, ''[[John Bull's Other Island]]'' (1904), when [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] laughed so hard during a command performance that he broke his chair</span>

				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=November 2015}}By the 1910s, Shaw was a well-established playwright</span>
				<span class='text'>New works such as ''[[Fanny's First Play]]'' (1911) and ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'' (1912), had long runs in front of large London audiences</span>
				<span class='text'> Shaw had permitted a musical adaptation of ''[[Arms and the Man]]'' (1894) called ''[[The Chocolate Soldier]]'' (1908), but he had a low opinion of German operetta</span>
				<span class='text'> He insisted that none of his dialogue be used, and that all the character names be changed, although the operetta actually follows Shaw's plot quite closely, in particular preserving its anti-war message</span>
				<span class='text'>The work proved very popular and would have made Shaw rich had he not waived his royalties, but he detested it and for the rest of his life forbade musicalization of his work, including a proposed [[Franz Lehár]] operetta based on ''Pygmalion''</span>
				<span class='text'> Several of his plays formed the basis of musicals after his death, most famously the musical ''[[My Fair Lady]]'', which is officially adapted from the screenplay of the film version of ''Pygmalion'' rather than the original stage play, keeping the film's ending</span>
				<span class='text'>Librettist [[Alan Jay Lerner]] kept generous chunks of Shaw's dialogue, and the characters' names, unchanged</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=November 2015}}During World War I--which Shaw opposed—he wrote one of his darkest and most highly regarded works, ''[[Heartbreak House]]'', a less than flattering look at the cultured class in England, and indeed, Europe, before the War</span>
				<span class='text'> It was not presented, however, until after the War</span>
				<span class='text'> He followed it with his longest and most ambitious work, ''[[Back To Methuselah]]'', made up of five related plays that do nothing less than attempt to tell the story of humanity from its beginning to its future</span>
				<span class='text'> Shaw declared it his masterpiece, though most critics did not agree</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=November 2015}}Next Shaw wrote what is generally conceded to be his last great work, ''[[Saint Joan (play)|Saint Joan]]'' (1923), inspired by her canonization in 1920</span>
				<span class='text'> He would continue writing plays until his death in 1950, and see some commercial successes, such as his contemplation on political leadership ''[[The Apple Cart]]'' (1929), but his work from this period tends to be revived far less than his earlier pieces</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=November 2015}}===Shaw and the Irish Literary Revival===Shaw’s rise to success coincided with the [[Irish Literary Revival]] in Irish-based drama and literature (although usually in English), led by figures such as [[W</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Yeats]], [[J</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Synge]], [[James Joyce]], and later [[Sean O’Casey]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Indeed, the play that made Shaw’s name in England, ''John Bull’s Other Island'', was set back in Ireland, and commissioned by Yeats for his new Dublin-based [[Abbey Theatre]], but rejected: &quot;Yeats and Synge did not feel that Shaw belonged to the real Irish tradition</span>
				<span class='text'>His plays would thus have no place in the Irish theatre movement</span>
				<span class='text'>Additionally, an important part of Shaw's plays was political argument, and Yeats detested this quality in dramatic writing</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kavanagh, ''The Story of the Abbey Theatre: From Its Origins in 1899 to the Present'', Devin-Adair, New York, 1950, p</span>
				<span class='text'>5</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Like Joyce, Shaw felt rather stifled by the movement: the play had been written at the request of &quot;Mr William Butler Yeats as a patriotic contribution to the Repertory of the Irish Literary Theatre</span>
				<span class='text'>Like most people who have asked me to write plays Mr Yeats got rather more than he bargained for</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>t was uncongenial to the whole spirit of the neo-Gaelic movement, which is bent on creating a new Ireland after its own ideal, whereas my play is a very uncompromising presentment of the real old Ireland</span>

				<span class='text'>His provocative pamphlet, Common Sense About the War, appeared as the trenches were being dug across France, in a 14 November 1914 supplement to the [[New Statesman]], founded just the year before by Sidney and Beatrice Webb</span>
				<span class='text'> Shaw savaged every nation's pretexts that had brought on the conflict, but particularly the British: &quot;The general truth of the situation is, as I have spent so much of my life in trying to make the English understand, that we are cursed with a fatal intellectual laziness, an evil inheritance from the time when our monopoly of coal and iron made it possible for us to become rich and powerful without thinking or knowing how</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>of suitable age and good character' would be welcomed and given work in the Soviet Union</span>
				<span class='text'>haw continued this support for Stalin's system in the preface to his play ''On the Rocks'' (1933) writing:{{quote|text=But the most elaborate code of this sort would still have left unspecified a hundred ways in which wreckers of Communism could have sidetracked it without ever having to face the essential questions: are you pulling your weight in the social boat? are you giving more trouble than you are worth? have you earned the privilege of living in a civilised community? That is why the Russians were forced to set up an Inquisition or Star Chamber, called at first the Cheka and now the Gay Pay Oo (Ogpu), to go into these questions and &quot;liquidate&quot; persons who could not answer them satisfactorily</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;br&gt;I must not suggest that this has occurred all over Russia; for I saw no underfed people there; and the children were remarkably plump</span>

				<span class='text'>Still, between satiety and starvation mitigated by cannibalism there are many degrees of shortage; and it is no secret that the struggle of the Russian Government to provide more collective farms and more giant factories to provide agricultural machinery for them has to be carried on against a constant clamor from the workers for new boots and clothes, and more varied food and more of it: in short, less sacrifice of the present to the future</span>

				<span class='text'>quot; He added:{{quote|Lysenko is on the right side as a Vitalist; but the situation is confused by the purely verbal snag that [[Karl Marx|Marx]] called his philosophy Dialectical Materialism</span>
				<span class='text'>Now in Russia Marx is a Pontif; and all scientists who do not call themselves Materialists must be persecuted</span>

				<span class='text'>Equality is essential to good breeding; and equality, as all economists know, is incompatible with property</span>

				<span class='text'>He became one, he later quipped, before he could think</span>
				<span class='text'>He adjudged the doctrines of the Church of Ireland, which he attended as a child, unintelligible or absurd</span>
				<span class='text'>Since the first of its Thirty-nine Articles describes god as &quot;without body, parts, or passions,&quot; he waggishly theorized that the church was atheistic</span>
				<span class='text'>An incomprehensible god, he opined, was tantamount to no god</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1875, he blazoned his Atheism abroad</span>
				<span class='text'>In a letter to Public Opinion, a Dublin newspaper, he announced &quot;with inflexible materialistic logic, and to the extreme horror of my respectable connections, that I was an atheist</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; In Immaturity, the first of five novels he wrote in his twenties, the young protagonist, obviously Shaw's alter ego, walks pensively in the cloisters of Westminster Abbey: &quot;His hushed step, impressive bearing, and reflective calm, marked him as a confirmed freethinker</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;br&gt;In &quot;The New Theology,&quot; he prepped his audience: &quot;When you are asked, 'Where is God? Who is God?' stand up and say, 'I am God and here is God, not as yet completed, but still advancing towards completion, just in so much as I am working for the purpose of the universe, working for the good of the whole society and the whole world, instead of merely looking after my personal ends</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;' God &quot;would provide himself with a perfectly fashioned and trustworthy instrument</span>
				<span class='text'>And such an instrument would be nothing less than God himself</span>
