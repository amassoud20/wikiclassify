				<span class='text'>if |thumb|''Essay on the principle of population'', 1826]]Malthus came to prominence for his 1798 essay on [[population growth]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In it he argued that population multiplies geometrically and food arithmetically; therefore, the population will eventually outstrip the food supply</span>
				<span class='text'>Between 1798 and 1826 he published six editions of ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'', updating each edition to incorporate new material, to address criticism, and to convey changes in his own perspectives on the subject</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote the original text in reaction to the optimism of his father and his father's associates (notably Rousseau) regarding the future improvement of society</span>
				<span class='text'>Malthus also constructed his case as a specific response to writings of [[William Godwin]] (1756–1836) and of the [[Marquis de Condorcet]] (1743–1794)</span>
				<span class='text'>he ''Essay'' gave rise to the '''Malthusian controversy''' during the next decades</span>
				<span class='text'>The content saw an emphasis on the [[birth rate]] and [[marriage rates]]</span>

				<span class='text'>In ''The Nature of Rent'' (1815), Malthus had dealt with [[economic rent]], a major concept in classical economics</span>
				<span class='text'>Ricardo defined a theory of rent in his ''Principles of Political Economy and Taxation'' (1817): he regarded rent as value in excess of real production—something caused by ownership rather than by free trade</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to this concept, Malthus proposed rent to be a kind of [[economic surplus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{cn|date=June 2015}}The debate developed over the economic concept of a [[general glut]], and the possibility of failure of [[Say's Law]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Malthus laid importance on [[economic development]] and the persistence of [[disequilibrium (economics)|disequilibrium]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;S193&quot;&gt;Sowell, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>193–4</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The context was the post-war depression; Malthus had a supporter in [[William Blake (economist)|William Blake]], in denying that [[capital accumulation]] (saving) was always good in such circumstances, and [[John Stuart Mill]] attacked Blake on the fringes of the debate</span>

				<span class='text'>The High UN projection suggests we could surpass this line by 2055</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In his essay, Malthus made the specific prediction that world population would fall below a line going upward from its then current population of one billion, adding one billion every 25 years</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote:{{quote|If the subsistence for man that the earth affords was to be increased every twenty-five years by a quantity equal to what the whole world at present produces, this would allow the power of production in the earth to be absolutely unlimited, and its ratio of increase much greater than we can conceive that any possible exertions of mankind could make it</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>yet still the power of population being a power of a superior order, the increase of the human species can only be kept commensurate to the increase of the means of subsistence by the constant operation of the strong law of necessity acting as a check upon the greater power</span>

				<span class='text'>The chart also illustrates the current UN data on world population since 1800, and UN projections for future growth</span>
				<span class='text'>To date, world population has remained below his predicted line</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the current rate of increase since 1955 is over two billion per 25 years, more than twice the Malthus predicted maximum rate</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time, world [[hunger]] has been in decline</span>
				<span class='text'>The highest UN projection has population continuing at this rate and surpassing the Malthus predicted line</span>
				<span class='text'>This high projection supposes today's growth rate is sustainable to the year 2100 and beyond</span>
				<span class='text'>n later editions of his essay, Malthus clarified his view that if society relied on human misery to limit population growth, then sources of misery (''e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>', hunger, disease, and war) would inevitably afflict society, as would volatile economic cycles</span>
				<span class='text'>On the other hand, &quot;preventive checks&quot; to population that limited birthrates, such as later marriages, could ensure a higher standard of living for all, while also increasing economic stability</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Essay (1826), I:2</span>
				<span class='text'>See also A:1:17&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding possibilities for freeing man from these limits, Malthus argued against a variety of imaginable solutions, such as the notion that agricultural improvements could expand without limit</span>
				<span class='text'>{cn|date=June 2015}}Of the relationship between population and economics, Malthus wrote that when the population of laborers grows faster than the production of food, real wages fall because the growing population causes the [[cost of living]] (''i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>', the cost of food) to go up</span>
				<span class='text'>Difficulties of raising a family eventually reduce the rate of population growth, until the falling population again leads to higher real wages</span>
				<span class='text'>n the second and subsequent editions Malthus put more emphasis on ''moral restraint'' as the best means of easing the poverty of the lower classes</span>

				<span class='text'>Instead, Malthus says that the high price stems from the [[Poor Laws]] which &quot;increase the parish allowances in proportion to the price of corn&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, given a limited supply, the Poor Laws force up the price of daily necessities</span>
				<span class='text'>But he concludes by saying that in time of scarcity such Poor Laws, by raising the price of corn more evenly, actually produce a ''beneficial'' effect</span>

				<span class='text'>At the end of the Napoleonic Wars that year, [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] passed legislation banning the importation of foreign corn into Britain until domestic corn cost 80 shillings per [[hundredweight|quarter]]</span>
