				<span class='text'>He spent seven years in the theatre, working in a succession of [[repertory theatre|stock companies]] and intermittently on Broadway</span>
				<span class='text'>Tracy's breakthrough came in 1930, when his lead performance in ''[[The Last Mile (play)|The Last Mile]]'' caught the attention of Hollywood</span>
				<span class='text'>After a successful film debut in ''[[Up the River]]'', Tracy was signed to a contract with [[Fox Film Corporation]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His five years with Fox were unremarkable, and he remained largely unknown to audiences after 25 films</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1935 Tracy joined [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], at the time Hollywood's most prestigious studio</span>
				<span class='text'>His career flourished with a series of hit films, and in 1937 and 1938 he won consecutive Oscars for ''[[Captains Courageous (1937 film)|Captains Courageous]]'' and ''[[Boys Town (film)|Boys Town]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>By the 1940s, Tracy was one of the studio's top stars</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In the fall of 1926, Tracy was offered his third shot at Broadway: a role in a new [[George M</span>

				<span class='text'>13; Crawford's comment: &quot;It was inspiring to play opposite Tracy,&quot; she said</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;His is such simplicity of performance, such naturalness and humor</span>
				<span class='text'>He walks through a scene</span>

				<span class='text'> He makes it seem so easy</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt; His four-time co-star [[Joan Bennett]] said, &quot;One never had the feeling he was 'acting' in a scene, but the truth of the situation was actually happening, spontaneously, at the moment he spoke his lines</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;des 13&quot;/&gt; James Cagney noted that Tracy was rarely the target of impressionists, because &quot;You can't mimic reserve and control very well&quot; and &quot;there's nothing to imitate except his genius and that can't be mimicked</span>

				<span class='text'>6</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Tracy's close friend [[Chester Erskine]] pinpointed his acting style as one of &quot;selection&quot;—he strove to give as little as was needed to be effective—reaching &quot;a minimum to make the maximum</span>

				<span class='text'>196</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; for instance saying to Kanin, &quot;Why do actors think they're so God damn important? They're not</span>

				<span class='text'>Plumbing is</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kanin (1971) p</span>
