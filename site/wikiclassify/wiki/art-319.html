				<span class='text'>Crosby convinced a record company to let Mitchell record a solo acoustic album without the folk-rock overdubs in vogue at the time, and his clout earned him a producer's credit in March 1968, when [[Reprise Records]] released her debut album, alternatively known as ''Joni Mitchell'' or ''[[Song to a Seagull]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>The following month, Reprise released her third album, ''[[Ladies of the Canyon]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Mitchell's sound was already beginning to expand beyond the confines of acoustic folk music and toward pop and rock, with more overdubs, percussion, and backing vocals, and for the first time, many songs composed on piano, which became a hallmark of Mitchell's style in her most popular era</span>
				<span class='text'>Her own version of &quot;[[Woodstock (song)|Woodstock]]&quot;, slower than the cover by [[Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young]], was performed solo on a [[Wurlitzer electric piano]]</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;''Ladies of the Canyon'' was an instant smash on [[FM radio]] and sold briskly, eventually becoming Mitchell's first gold album (selling over a half million copies)</span>
				<span class='text'>She made a decision to stop touring for a year and just write and paint, yet she was still voted &quot;Top Female Performer&quot; for 1970 by ''[[Melody Maker]]'', the UK's leading pop music magazine</span>

				<span class='text'>Mitchell later remarked, &quot;At that period of my life, I had no personal defenses</span>

				<span class='text'>'[[Court and Spark]]'', released in January 1974, saw Mitchell begin the flirtation with [[jazz]] and [[jazz fusion]] that marked her experimental period ahead</span>
				<span class='text'>''Court and Spark'' went to No</span>
				<span class='text'>1 on the Cashbox Album Charts</span>
				<span class='text'>The LP made Mitchell a widely popular act for perhaps the only time in her career, on the strength of popular tracks such as the rocker &quot;Raised on Robbery&quot;, which was released right before Christmas 1973, and &quot;[[Help Me (Joni Mitchell song)|Help Me]]&quot;, which was released in March of the following year, and became Mitchell's only Top 10 single when it peaked at No</span>
				<span class='text'>7 in the first week of June</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;[[Free Man in Paris]]&quot; was another hit single and staple in her catalog</span>

				<span class='text'>&quot;Big Yellow Taxi&quot;, the live version, was also released as a single and did reasonably well (Mitchell released yet another recording of &quot;Big Yellow Taxi&quot; in 2007)</span>

				<span class='text'>A few months later she recorded versions of the tunes with her band</span>
				<span class='text'>Her musical interests were now diverging from both the folk and the pop scene of the era, toward less structured, more jazz-inspired pieces, with a wider range of instruments</span>
				<span class='text'>The new song cycle was released in November 1975 as ''[[The Hissing of Summer Lawns]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>On &quot;The Jungle Line&quot;, she made an early effort at [[sample (music)|sampling]] a recording of African musicians, something that became more commonplace among Western rock acts in the 1980s</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;In France They Kiss on Main Street&quot; continued the lush pop sounds of ''Court and Spark'', and efforts such as the title song and &quot;Edith and the Kingpin&quot; chronicled the underbelly of suburban lives in Southern California</span>
				<span class='text'>uring 1975, Mitchell also participated in several concerts in the [[Rolling Thunder Revue tours]] featuring [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Joan Baez]], and in 1976 she performed as part of ''[[The Last Waltz]]'' by [[the Band]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In January 1976, Mitchell received a nomination for the [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] for the album ''The Hissing of Summer Lawns'', though the Grammy went to [[Linda Ronstadt]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n early 1976, Mitchell traveled with friends who were driving cross country to Maine</span>
				<span class='text'>Afterwards, she drove back to California alone and composed several songs during her journey which featured on her next album, 1976's ''[[Hejira (album)|Hejira]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>She stated that &quot;This album was written mostly while I was traveling in the car</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;crowe&quot; /&gt; ''Hejira'' was arguably Mitchell's most experimental album so far, due to her ongoing collaborations with jazz virtuoso bass guitarist [[Jaco Pastorius]] on several songs, namely the first single, &quot;[[Coyote (song)|Coyote]]&quot;, the atmospheric &quot;Hejira&quot;, the disorienting, guitar-heavy &quot;Black Crow&quot;, and the album's last song &quot;Refuge of the Roads&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The album climbed to No</span>
				<span class='text'>13 on the Billboard Charts, reaching gold status three weeks after release, and received airplay from album oriented FM rock stations</span>

				<span class='text'>In 2006 she said, &quot;I suppose a lot of people could have written a lot of my other songs, but I feel the songs on ''Hejira'' could only have come from me</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ottawa&quot; /&gt;In mid-1977, Mitchell began work on new recordings, that became her first double studio album</span>
				<span class='text'>Close to completing her contract with Asylum Records, Mitchell felt that this album could be looser in feel than any album she'd done in the past</span>
				<span class='text'>She invited Pastorius back, and he brought with him fellow members of jazz fusion pioneers [[Weather Report]], including drummer Don Alias and saxophonist Wayne Shorter</span>
				<span class='text'>Layered, atmospheric compositions such as &quot;Overture/Cotton Avenue&quot; featured more improvisatory collaboration, while &quot;Paprika Plains&quot; was a 16-minute epic that stretched the boundaries of pop, owing more to Mitchell's memories of childhood in Canada and her study of classical music</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Dreamland&quot; and &quot;The Tenth World&quot;, featuring [[Chaka Khan]] on backing vocals, were percussion-dominated tracks</span>
				<span class='text'>Other songs continued the jazz-rock-folk collisions of ''Hejira''</span>
				<span class='text'>Mitchell also revived &quot;Jericho&quot;, written but never recorded years earlier (a version is found on her 1974 live album)</span>

				<span class='text'>She began a collaboration with Mingus, who died before the project was completed in 1979</span>
				<span class='text'>She finished the tracks, and the resulting album, ''[[Mingus (Joni Mitchell album)|Mingus]]'', was released in June 1979, though it was poorly received in the press</span>
				<span class='text'>Fans were confused over such a major change in Mitchell's overall sound, and though the album topped out at No</span>
				<span class='text'>17 on the Billboard album charts—a higher placement than ''Don Juan's Reckless Daughter''—''Mingus'' still fell short of gold status, making it her first album since the 1960s to not sell at least a half-million copies</span>
				<span class='text'>itchell's tour to promote ''Mingus'' began in August 1979 in Oklahoma City and concluded six weeks later with five shows at Los Angeles' [[Greek Theatre (Los Angeles)|Greek Theatre]] and one at the [[Santa Barbara County Bowl]], where she recorded and filmed the concert</span>
				<span class='text'>It was her first tour in several years, and with Pastorius, jazz guitarist [[Pat Metheny]], and other members of her band, Mitchell also performed songs from her other jazz-inspired albums</span>
				<span class='text'>When the tour ended she began a year of work, turning the tapes from the Santa Barbara County Bowl show into a two-album set and a concert film, both to be called ''[[Shadows and Light (Joni Mitchell album)|Shadows and Light]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Her final release on Asylum Records and her second live double-album, it was released in September 1980, and made it up to No</span>

				<span class='text'>A performance from the tour was videotaped and later released on home video (and later DVD) as ''Refuge of the Roads''</span>
				<span class='text'>As 1984 ended, Mitchell was writing new songs, when she received a suggestion from Geffen that perhaps an outside producer with experience in the modern technical arenas that they wanted to explore might be a worthy addition</span>
				<span class='text'>British [[synthpop]] performer and producer [[Thomas Dolby]] was brought on board</span>
				<span class='text'>Of Dolby's role, Mitchell later commented: &quot;I was reluctant when Thomas was suggested because he had been asked to produce the record [by Geffen], and would he consider coming in as just a programmer and a player?

				<span class='text'>n 1996, Mitchell agreed to release a greatest ''[[Hits (Joni Mitchell album)|Hits]]'' collection when label Reprise also allowed her a second ''[[Misses (album)|Misses]]'' album to include some of the lesser known songs from her career</span>
				<span class='text'>''Hits'' charted at No</span>
				<span class='text'>161 in the US, but made No</span>
				<span class='text'>6 in the UK</span>
				<span class='text'>Mitchell also included on ''Hits'', for the first time on an album, her first recording, a version of &quot;Urge for Going&quot; which preceded ''Song to a Seagull'' but was previously released only as a B-side</span>
				<span class='text'>wo years later, Mitchell released her final set of &quot;original&quot; new work before nearly a decade of other pursuits, 1998's ''[[Taming the Tiger]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>She promoted ''Tiger'' with a return to regular concert appearances, including a co-headlining tour with [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Van Morrison]]</span>
				<span class='text'>On the album, Mitchell had played a &quot;[[guitar synthesizer]]&quot; on most songs, and for the tour she adapted many of her old songs to this instrument, and reportedly had to re-learn all her complex tunings once again</span>
				<span class='text'>t was around this time that critics also began to notice a real change in Mitchell's voice, particularly on her older songs; the singer later admitted to feeling the same way, explaining that &quot;I'd go to hit a note and there was nothing there&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;renai&quot; /&gt; In an interview in 2004, she denied that &quot;my terrible habits&quot; had anything to do with her more limited range and pointed out that singers often lose the upper register when they pass fifty</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, she contended that in her opinion her voice became a more interesting and expressive alto range when she could no longer hit the high notes, let alone hold them like she did in her youth</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;National Public Radio</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The singer's next two albums featured no new songs and, Mitchell has said, were recorded to &quot;fulfill contractual obligations&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Toronto&quot; /&gt; but on both she attempted to make use of her new vocal range in interpreting familiar material</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[Both Sides, Now]]'' (2000) was an album composed mostly of covers of jazz standards, performed with an orchestra, featuring orchestral arrangements by [[Vince Mendoza]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The album also contained remakes of &quot;[[A Case of You]]&quot; and the title track &quot;Both Sides Now&quot;, two early hits transposed down to Mitchell's now dusky, soulful alto range</span>
				<span class='text'>It received mostly strong reviews and spawned a short national tour, with Mitchell accompanied by a core band featuring Larry Klein on bass plus a local orchestra on each tour stop</span>
				<span class='text'>Its success led to 2002's ''[[Travelogue (Joni Mitchell album)|Travelogue]]'', a collection of re-workings of her previous songs with lush orchestral accompaniments</span>
				<span class='text'>==2002–2005: Retirement and retrospectives===Mitchell stated at the time that ''Travelogue'' would be her final album</span>
				<span class='text'>In a 2002 interview with ''Rolling Stone'', she voiced discontent with the current state of the music industry, describing it as a &quot;cesspool&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;wild&quot; /&gt; Mitchell expressed her dislike of the record industry's dominance and her desire to control her own destiny, possibly by releasing her own music over the Internet</span>
				<span class='text'>uring the next few years, the only albums Mitchell released were compilations of her earlier work</span>
				<span class='text'>In 2003, her Geffen recordings were collected in a remastered four-disc box set, ''The Complete Geffen Recordings'', including notes by Mitchell and three previously unreleased tracks</span>
				<span class='text'>A series of themed compilations of songs from earlier albums were also released: ''The Beginning of Survival'' (2004), ''[[Dreamland (Joni Mitchell album)|Dreamland]]'' (2004), and ''Songs of a Prairie Girl'' (2005), the last of which collected the threads of her Canadian upbringing and which she released after accepting an invitation to the [[Commemorative Medal for the Centennial of Saskatchewan|Saskatchewan Centennial]] concert in Saskatoon</span>
				<span class='text'>The concert, which featured a tribute to Mitchell, was also attended by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In the ''Prairie Girl'' liner notes, she writes that the collection is &quot;my contribution to Saskatchewan's Centennial celebrations&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>allow[ing] her to build such a powerful identification among her female fans&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Mitchell asserted her desire for artistic control throughout her career, and still holds the publishing rights for her music</span>
				<span class='text'>While she has disclaimed the notion that she is a &quot;feminist&quot;, David Shumway notes that &quot;she became the first woman in popular music to be recognized as an artist in the full sense of that term</span>
				<span class='text'>She rose to popularity at a time when women were still primarily singers of other people's songs and who were marketed almost exclusively on their sex appeal</span>
				<span class='text'>Though Mitchell undeniably had the latter, it was not what made people buy her records or love her songs</span>
