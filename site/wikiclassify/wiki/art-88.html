				<span class='text'>Chaplin became a worldwide icon through his screen persona &quot;[[the Tramp]]&quot; and is considered one of the most important figures in the history of the [[film industry]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; His career spanned more than 75 years, from childhood in the [[Victorian era]] until a year before his death in 1977, and encompassed both adulation and controversy</span>
				<span class='text'>haplin's childhood in London was one of poverty and hardship</span>
				<span class='text'>As his father was absent and his mother struggled financially, he was sent to a [[workhouse]] twice before the age of nine</span>
				<span class='text'>When he was 14, his mother was committed to a mental asylum</span>
				<span class='text'>Chaplin began performing at an early age, touring [[music hall]]s and later working as a stage actor and comedian</span>
				<span class='text'>At 19 he was signed to the prestigious [[Fred Karno]] company, which took him to America</span>
				<span class='text'>Chaplin was scouted for the film industry, and began appearing in 1914 for [[Keystone Studios]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He soon developed the Tramp persona and formed a large fan base</span>
				<span class='text'>Chaplin directed his own films from an early stage, and continued to hone his craft as he moved to the [[Essanay]], [[Mutual Film|Mutual]], and [[First National]] corporations</span>
				<span class='text'>By 1918, he was one of the best known figures in the world</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1919, Chaplin co-founded the distribution company [[United Artists]], which gave him complete control over his films</span>
				<span class='text'>His first [[feature-length]] was ''[[The Kid (1921 film)|The Kid]]'' (1921), followed by ''[[A Woman of Paris]]'' (1923), ''[[The Gold Rush]]'' (1925), and ''[[The Circus (film)|The Circus]]'' (1928)</span>
				<span class='text'>He refused to move to [[sound film]]s in the 1930s, instead producing ''[[City Lights]]'' (1931) and ''[[Modern Times (film)|Modern Times]]'' (1936) without dialogue</span>
				<span class='text'>Chaplin became increasingly political, and his next film, ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' (1940), satirised [[Adolf Hitler]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The 1940s were a decade marked with controversy for Chaplin, and his popularity declined rapidly</span>
				<span class='text'>He was accused of [[communist]] sympathies, while his involvement in a [[paternity suit]] and marriages to much younger women caused scandal</span>
				<span class='text'>An [[FBI]] investigation was opened, and Chaplin was forced to leave the United States and settle in Switzerland</span>
				<span class='text'>He abandoned the Tramp in his later films, which include ''[[Monsieur Verdoux]]'' (1947), ''[[Limelight (1952 film)|Limelight]]'' (1952), ''[[A King in New York]]'' (1957), and ''[[A Countess from Hong Kong]]'' (1967)</span>
				<span class='text'>haplin wrote, directed, produced, edited, starred in, and composed the music for most of his films</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a perfectionist, and his financial independence enabled him to spend years on the development and production of a picture</span>
				<span class='text'>His films are characterised by [[slapstick]] combined with [[pathos]], typified in the Tramp's struggles against adversity</span>
				<span class='text'>Many contain social and political themes, as well as autobiographical elements</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1972, as part of a renewed appreciation for his work, Chaplin received an [[Academy Honorary Award|Honorary Academy Award]] for &quot;the incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures the art form of this century&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He continues to be held in high regard, with ''The Gold Rush'', ''City Lights'', ''Modern Times'', and ''The Great Dictator'' often ranked on industry lists of the greatest films of all time</span>

				<span class='text'>386</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Parallels between himself and [[Adolf Hitler]] had been widely noted: the pair were born four days apart, both had risen from poverty to world prominence, and the German dictator wore the same [[toothbrush moustache]] as the Tramp</span>
				<span class='text'>It was this physical resemblance that supplied the plot for Chaplin's next film, ''[[The Great Dictator]]'', which directly satirised Hitler and attacked fascism</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|A 1922 image of [[Charlie Chaplin Studios]], where all of Chaplin's films between 1918 and 1952 were produced]]Chaplin never spoke more than cursorily about his filmmaking methods, claiming such a thing would be tantamount to a magician spoiling his own illusion</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Rob606&quot;&gt;Robinson, p</span>
				<span class='text'>606</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Little was known about his working process throughout his lifetime,&lt;ref&gt;Brownlow, p</span>
				<span class='text'>7</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; but research from film historians – particularly the findings of [[Kevin Brownlow]] and [[David Gill (film historian)|David Gill]] that were presented in the three-part documentary ''[[Unknown Chaplin]]'' (1983) – has since revealed his unique working method</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;LouRob&quot;&gt;Louvish, p</span>
				<span class='text'>103; Robinson, p</span>
				<span class='text'>168</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Until he began making spoken dialogue films with ''The Great Dictator'', Chaplin never shot from a completed script</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Robinson, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>173, 197, 310, 489</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Many of his early films began with only a vague premise – for example &quot;Charlie enters a health spa&quot; or &quot;Charlie works in a pawn shop</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, p</span>
				<span class='text'>169</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He then had sets constructed and worked with his stock company to improvise gags and &quot;business&quot; using them, almost always working the ideas out on film</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;LouRob&quot;/&gt; As ideas were accepted and discarded, a narrative structure would emerge, frequently requiring Chaplin to reshoot an already-completed scene that might have otherwise contradicted the story</span>

				<span class='text'>168; Robinson, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>166–170, pp</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; From ''A Woman of Paris'' onward Chaplin began the filming process with a prepared plot,&lt;ref&gt;Louvish, p</span>
				<span class='text'>182</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; but Robinson writes that every film up to ''Modern Times'' &quot;went through many metamorphoses and permutations before the story took its final form</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, p</span>
				<span class='text'>460</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Producing films in this manner meant Chaplin took longer to complete his pictures than almost any other filmmaker at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Louvish, p</span>
				<span class='text'>228</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; If he was out of ideas he often took a break from the shoot, which could last for days, while keeping the studio ready for when inspiration returned</span>

				<span class='text'>234–235; Cousins, p</span>
				<span class='text'>71</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Brownlow, p</span>

				<span class='text'>Although some critics have claimed that credit for his film music should be given to the composers who worked with him, Raksin – who worked with Chaplin on ''Modern Times'' – has stressed Chaplin's creative position and active participation in the composing process</span>

				<span class='text'>47–50</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This process, which could take months, would start with Chaplin describing to the composer(s) exactly what he wanted and singing or playing tunes he had improvised on the piano</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Raksin1&quot;/&gt; These tunes were then developed further in a close collaboration among the composer(s) and Chaplin</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Raksin1&quot;/&gt; According to film historian [[Jeffrey Vance]], &quot;although he relied upon associates to arrange varied and complex instrumentation, the musical imperative is his, and not a note in a Chaplin musical score was placed there without his assent</span>
