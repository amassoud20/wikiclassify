				<span class='text'>Fresnel studied the behaviour of light both theoretically and experimentally</span>
				<span class='text'>e is perhaps best known as the [[inventor]] of the [[Fresnel lens]], first adopted in [[lighthouse]]s while he was a French commissioner of lighthouses, and found in many applications today</span>
				<span class='text'> His [[Fresnel equations]] on waves and [[reflectivity]] also form the basis for many applications in [[computer graphics]] today - for instance, the rendering of [[water]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Personal life and education==Fresnel was the  son of an architect, born at [[Broglie, Eure|Broglie]] ([[Eure]])</span>
				<span class='text'>His early progress in learning was slow, and he still could not read when he was eight years old</span>
				<span class='text'>At thirteen he entered the √âcole Centrale in [[Caen]], and at sixteen and a half the [[√âcole Polytechnique]], where he acquitted himself with distinction</span>
				<span class='text'>From there he went to the [[√âcole Nationale des Ponts et Chauss√©es|√âcole des Ponts et Chauss√©es]]</span>
				<span class='text'>e received only scant public recognition during his lifetime for his labours in the cause of optical science</span>
				<span class='text'>Some of his papers were not printed by the [[Acad√©mie des Sciences]] until many years after his death</span>
				<span class='text'>But as he wrote to Young in 1824: in himself &quot;that sensibility, or that vanity, which people call love of glory&quot; had been blunted</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;All the compliments,&quot; he says, &quot;that I have received from [[Fran√ßois Arago|Arago]], [[Pierre Simon, Marquis de Laplace|Laplace]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Biot|Biot]] never gave me so much pleasure as the discovery of a theoretic truth, or the confirmation of a calculation by experiment&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} He appears to have begun his research in optics around 1814, when he prepared a paper on the [[aberration of light]], although it was never published</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1815, on the second restoration of the monarchy, he obtained a post as engineer in [[Paris]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1818 he wrote a memoir on [[diffraction]], for which he received the prize of the [[French Academy of Sciences|Acad√©mie des Sciences]] at Paris the following year</span>
				<span class='text'>He was the first to construct a special type of lens, now called a [[Fresnel lens]], as a substitute for mirrors in lighthouses</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1819, he was nominated to be a commissioner of lighthouses</span>
				<span class='text'> In 1823 he was unanimously elected a member of the academy</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1825 he became a member of the [[Royal Society of London]]</span>
				<span class='text'> In 1827, the time of his last illness, the Royal Society of London awarded him the [[Rumford Medal]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In 1817, Young had proposed a small transverse component to light, while yet retaining a far larger longitudinal component</span>
				<span class='text'>Fresnel, by the year 1821, was able to show by mathematical methods that [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] could be explained only if light was ''entirely'' transverse, with no longitudinal vibration whatsoever</span>

				<span class='text'>His use of two plane mirrors of metal, forming with each other an angle of nearly 180¬∞, allowed him to avoid the diffraction effects caused (by the apertures) in the experiment of [[Francesco Maria Grimaldi|F</span>

				<span class='text'>Grimaldi]] on [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This allowed him to conclusively account for the phenomenon of interference in accordance with the wave theory</span>

				<span class='text'>Incoming light, if linearly polarized at 45¬∞ with respect to the [[plane of incidence]] (along the page) has the relative phase of its ''s'' and ''p'' [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] components altered at two reflections, outputting a [[circularly polarized]] beam</span>
				<span class='text'>]With [[Fran√ßois Arago]] he studied the laws of the interference of polarized rays</span>
				<span class='text'>He obtained circularly polarized light by means of a rhombus of glass, known as a [[Fresnel rhomb]], having obtuse angles of 126¬∞ and acute angles of 54¬∞</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Fresnel‚ÄìArago laws]] are three laws which summarise some of the more important properties of [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] between light of different states of [[polarization (waves)|polarization]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The laws are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://scienceworld</span>

				<span class='text'> Two parallel coherent linearly polarized waves will interfere in the same way as [[Sunlight|natural light]]</span>
				<span class='text'> The two constituent orthogonal linearly polarized states of natural light cannot interfere to form a readily observable interference pattern, even if rotated into alignment (because they are incoherent)</span>
				<span class='text'>he [[Fresnel equations]] describe the behaviour of [[light]] when moving between [[medium (optics)|media]] of differing [[refractive index|refractive indices]]</span>
				<span class='text'>When light moves from a medium of a given [[refractive index]] ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; into a second medium with refractive index ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, both [[reflection (physics)|reflection]] and [[refraction]] of the light may occur</span>
				<span class='text'>he [[Fresnel diffraction]] equation is an approximation of [[Kirchhoff's diffraction formula|Kirchhoff-Fresnel diffraction]] that can be applied to the propagation of waves in the [[near and far field|near field]]</span>
