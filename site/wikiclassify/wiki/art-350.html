				<span class='text'>Johann, aware of [[Leopold Mozart]]'s successes in this area (with son [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Wolfgang]] and daughter [[Maria Anna Mozart|Nannerl]]), attempted to exploit his son as a [[child prodigy]], claiming that Beethoven was six (he was seven) on the posters for Beethoven's first public performance in March 1778</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Thayer|1921|p=59}}Some time after 1779, Beethoven began his studies with his most important teacher in Bonn, [[Christian Gottlob Neefe]], who was appointed the Court's Organist in that year</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Thayer|1921|p=67}} Neefe taught Beethoven composition, and by March 1783 had helped him write his first published composition: a set of keyboard variations ([[WoO]] 63)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Stanley7&quot;/&gt; Beethoven soon began working with Neefe as assistant organist, at first unpaid (1781), and then as a paid employee (1784) of the court chapel conducted by the Kapellmeister [[Andrea Luchesi]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Echoing changes made in Vienna by his brother [[Joseph II of Austria|Joseph]], he introduced reforms based on [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment philosophy]], with increased support for education and the arts</span>
				<span class='text'>The teenage Beethoven was almost certainly influenced by these changes</span>
				<span class='text'>He may also have been influenced at this time by ideas prominent in [[freemasonry]], as Neefe and others around Beethoven were members of the local chapter of the [[Illuminati|Order of the Illuminati]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Cooper|2008|p=15}}In March 1787 Beethoven traveled to Vienna (possibly at another's expense) for the first time, apparently in the hope of studying with Mozart</span>
				<span class='text'>The details of [[Beethoven and Mozart|their relationship]] are uncertain, including whether they actually met</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 23}} Having learned that his mother was ill, Beethoven returned about two weeks after his arrival</span>
				<span class='text'>His mother died shortly thereafter, and his father lapsed deeper into [[alcoholism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, Beethoven became responsible for the care of his two younger brothers, and spent the next five years in Bonn</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 24}}Beethoven was introduced in these years to several people who became important in his life</span>
				<span class='text'>Franz Wegeler, a young medical student, introduced him to the von Breuning family (one of whose daughters Wegeler eventually married)</span>
				<span class='text'>Beethoven often visited the von Breuning household, where he taught piano to some of the children</span>
				<span class='text'>Here he encountered German and classical literature</span>
				<span class='text'>The von Breuning family environment was less stressful than his own, which was increasingly dominated by his father's decline</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 16}} Beethoven also came to the attention of [[Count Ferdinand Ernst Gabriel von Waldstein|Count Ferdinand von Waldstein]], who became a lifelong friend and financial supporter</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Thayer|1921|p=102}}In 1789 Beethoven obtained a legal order by which half of his father's salary was paid directly to him for support of the family</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Thayer|1921|p=104}} He also contributed further to the family's income by playing [[viola]] in the court orchestra</span>
				<span class='text'>This familiarised Beethoven with a variety of operas, including three by Mozart that were performed at court in this period</span>
				<span class='text'>He also befriended [[Anton Reicha]], a [[flute|flautist]] and violinist of about his own age who was a nephew of the court orchestra's conductor, [[Josef Reicha]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Thayer|1921|pp=105–109}}===Establishing his career in Vienna===From 1790 to 1792, Beethoven composed a significant number of works (none were published at the time, and most are now listed as [[WoO|works without opus]]) that demonstrated his growing range and maturity</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Musicologist]]s have identified a theme similar to those of his [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>3 (Beethoven)|Third Symphony]] in a set of variations written in 1791</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 35–41}} Beethoven was probably first introduced to [[Joseph Haydn]] in late 1790, when the latter was traveling to London and stopped in Bonn around Christmas time</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 35}} A year and a half later, they met in Bonn on Haydn's return trip from London to Vienna in July 1792, and it is likely that arrangements were made at that time for Beethoven to study with the old master</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 41}} With the Elector's help, Beethoven left Bonn for Vienna in November 1792, amid rumors of [[First Coalition|war spilling out of France]]; he learned shortly after his arrival that his father had died</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Thayer|1921|p=124}}{{sfn|Thayer|1921|p=148}}{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 42}} Mozart had also recently died</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 42}} Over the next few years, Beethoven responded to the widespread feeling that he was a successor to the recently deceased Mozart by studying that master's work and writing works with a distinctly Mozartean flavor</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 47,54}} Early in this period, he also began receiving occasional instruction from [[Antonio Salieri]], primarily in Italian vocal composition style; this relationship persisted until at least 1802, and possibly 1809</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Thayer|1921|p=161}} With Haydn's departure for England in 1794, Beethoven was expected by the Elector to return home</span>
				<span class='text'>He chose instead to remain in Vienna, continuing his instruction in counterpoint with [[Johann Georg Albrechtsberger|Johann Albrechtsberger]] and other teachers</span>
				<span class='text'>Although his stipend from the Elector expired, a number of Viennese noblemen had already recognised his ability and offered him financial support, among them [[Joseph Franz von Lobkowitz|Prince Joseph Franz Lobkowitz]], [[Karl Alois Johann-Nepomuk Vinzenz, Fürst Lichnowsky|Prince Karl Lichnowsky]], and Baron [[Gottfried van Swieten]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 53}}By 1793, Beethoven had established a reputation as an improviser in the salons of the nobility, often playing the [[Prelude (music)|prelude]]s and [[fugue]]s of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 46}} By 1793, he had established a reputation in Vienna as a piano virtuoso, but he apparently withheld works from publication so that their publication in 1795 would have greater impact</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 53}} Beethoven's first public performance in Vienna was in March 1795, a concert in which he first performed one of his [[piano concerto]]s</span>

				<span class='text'>These works were dedicated to his patron Prince Lichnowsky,{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 59}} and were a financial success; Beethoven's profits were nearly sufficient to cover his living expenses for a year</span>

				<span class='text'>8 (Beethoven)|Pathétique]]&quot; sonata (Op</span>
				<span class='text'>13), which Cooper describes as &quot;surpass[ing] any of his previous compositions, in strength of character, depth of emotion, level of originality, and ingenuity of motivic and tonal manipulation</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 82}} He also completed his [[Septet (Beethoven)|Septet]] (Op</span>

				<span class='text'>The concert, which the ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung]]'' described as &quot;the most interesting concert in a long time,&quot; was not without difficulties; among the criticisms was that &quot;the players did not bother to pay any attention to the soloist</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 90}}Mozart and Haydn were undeniable influences</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, Beethoven's [[Quintet for Piano and Winds (Beethoven)|quintet for piano and winds]] is said to bear a strong resemblance to [[Quintet for Piano and Winds (Mozart)|Mozart's work for the same configuration]], albeit with his own distinctive touches</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 66}}&lt;!-- could do with referenced discussion of some other influences here: Bach?
