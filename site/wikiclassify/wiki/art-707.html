				<span class='text'>In 1999, the [[American Film Institute]] ranked Crawford tenth on their list of the [[AFI's 100 Years</span>

				<span class='text'>eginning her career as a dancer in travelling theatrical companies before debuting as a chorus girl on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], Crawford signed a motion picture contract with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in 1925</span>
				<span class='text'>In the 1930s, Crawford's fame rivaled, and later outlasted, MGM colleagues [[Norma Shearer]] and [[Greta Garbo]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Crawford often played hard-working young women who find romance and success</span>
				<span class='text'>These stories were well received by [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era audiences and were popular with women</span>
				<span class='text'>Crawford became one of [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]]'s most prominent movie stars and one of the highest paid women in the United States, but her films began losing money, and, by the end of the 1930s, she was labelled &quot;[[Box Office Poison (magazine article)|Box Office Poison]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>But her career gradually improved in the early 1940s, and she made a major comeback in 1945 by starring in ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'', for which she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]</span>
				<span class='text'>She would go on to receive Best Actress nominations for ''[[Possessed (1947 film)|Possessed]]'' (1947) and ''[[Sudden Fear]]'' (1952)</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1955, she became involved with the [[PepsiCo|Pepsi-Cola Company]] through her marriage to company Chairman [[Alfred Steele]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After his death in 1959, Crawford was elected to fill his vacancy on the board of directors but was forcibly retired in 1973</span>
				<span class='text'>She continued acting in film and television regularly through the 1960s, when her performances became fewer; after the release of the British horror film ''[[Trog]]'' in 1970, Crawford retired from the screen</span>
				<span class='text'>Following a public appearance in 1974, after which unflattering photographs were published, Crawford withdrew from public life and became increasingly reclusive until her death in 1977</span>
				<span class='text'>rawford married four times</span>
				<span class='text'>Her first three marriages ended in divorce; the last ended with the death of husband Alfred Steele</span>
				<span class='text'>She adopted five children, one of whom was reclaimed by his birth mother</span>
				<span class='text'>Crawford's relationships with her two older children, [[Christina Crawford|Christina]] and Christopher, were acrimonious</span>
				<span class='text'>Crawford disinherited the two, and, after Crawford's death, Christina wrote a &quot;tell-all&quot; memoir titled, ''[[Mommie Dearest]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>=Early life==Crawford was born Lucille Fay LeSueur in [[San Antonio, Texas]], on March 23; the year is disputed, with 1904, 1905, and 1906 the most likely estimates, all cited in varying sources,&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot; name=&quot;birthyear&quot;/&gt; the third child of Thomas E</span>

				<span class='text'>However, after his death on January 1, 1938, his age was given as 71</span>
				<span class='text'>Crawford's mother subsequently married Henry J</span>
				<span class='text'>Cassin (died October 25, 1922)</span>
				<span class='text'>This marriage is listed in census records as Crawford's mother's first marriage, calling into question whether Thomas LeSueur and Anna Bell Johnson were ever legally wed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;spoto&quot;/&gt;The family lived in [[Lawton, Oklahoma]], where Cassin, a minor impresario, ran the Ramsey Opera House</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite his own relatively minor status as an impresario, Cassin managed to get such diverse and noted performers as [[Anna Pavlova]] and [[Eva Tanguay]] during his career</span>
				<span class='text'>Young Lucille was reportedly unaware that Cassin, whom she called &quot;Daddy&quot;, was not her biological father until her brother Hal told her</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Newquist, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>25&lt;/ref&gt; Lucille preferred the nickname &quot;Billie&quot; as a child and she loved watching [[vaudeville]] acts perform on the stage of her stepfather's theatre</span>
				<span class='text'>The instability of her family life affected her education and her schooling never formally progressed beyond elementary school</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>30&lt;/ref&gt; Shubert put her in the chorus line for his 1924 show, ''Innocent Eyes'', at the [[Winter Garden Theatre]] on [[Broadway (theatre)|Broadway]] in New York City</span>
				<span class='text'>While appearing in ''Innocent Eyes'' Crawford met a saxophone player named James Welton</span>
				<span class='text'>The two were allegedly married in 1924 and lived together for several months, although this supposed marriage was never mentioned in later life by Crawford</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=considine12&gt;Considine, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>12&lt;/ref&gt;Crawford wanted additional work and approached [[Loews Theaters]] publicist [[Nils Granlund]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Granlund secured a position for her with producer Harry Richmond's act and arranged for her to do a screen test which he sent to producer [[Harry Rapf]] in Hollywood</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Granlund&quot;&gt;Granlund, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>147&lt;/ref&gt; (Stories have persisted that Crawford further supplemented her income by appearing in one or more [[Pornographic film|stag]], or soft-core pornographic, films,&lt;ref name=considine12/&gt; although this has been disputed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Thomas, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>106&lt;/ref&gt;)Rapf notified Granlund on December 24, 1924 that [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (or MGM for short) had offered Crawford a contract at $75 a week</span>
				<span class='text'>Granlund immediately wired LeSueur – who had returned to her mother's home in Kansas City – with the news; she borrowed $400 for travel expenses</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;movie contract&quot;&gt;Granlund, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>135&lt;/ref&gt; She departed Kansas City on December 26 and arrived in [[Culver City, California]] on January 1, 1925</span>
				<span class='text'>redited as Lucille LeSueur, her first film was ''[[Lady of the Night]]'' in 1925, as the [[body double]] for MGM's most-popular female star, [[Norma Shearer]]</span>
				<span class='text'>She also appeared in ''[[The Circle (1925 film)|The Circle]]'' and ''[[Pretty Ladies]]'' (both 1925), starring comedienne [[ZaSu Pitts]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This was soon followed by equally small and [[Billing (filmmaking)|unbilled]] roles in two other 1925 successes, ''[[The Only Thing]]'' and ''[[The Merry Widow (1925 film)|The Merry Widow]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>GM publicity head [[Pete Smith (film producer)|Pete Smith]] recognized her ability to become a major star, but felt her name sounded fake; he told studio head [[Louis B</span>
				<span class='text'>Mayer]] that her last name—LeSueur—reminded him of a sewer</span>
				<span class='text'>Smith organized a contest called &quot;Name the Star&quot; in ''Movie Weekly'' to allow readers to select her new stage name</span>
				<span class='text'>The initial choice was &quot;Joan Arden&quot; but, after another actress was found to have prior claim to that name, the alternate surname &quot;Crawford&quot; became the choice</span>
				<span class='text'>Crawford later said that she wanted her first name to be pronounced &quot;Jo-Anne&quot;, and that she hated the name Crawford because it sounded like &quot;craw fish&quot;, but also admitted she &quot;liked the security&quot; that went with the name</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Crawford, quoted in Newquist, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>31&lt;/ref&gt;===Self-promotion and early successes===Growing increasingly frustrated over the size and quality of the parts she was given, Crawford embarked on a campaign of self-promotion</span>

				<span class='text'>From the beginning of her career, Crawford considered [[Norma Shearer]]—the studio's most-popular actress—her professional nemesis</span>
				<span class='text'>Since Shearer was married to MGM Head of Production [[Irving Thalberg]], she had the first choice of scripts and had more control than other stars in what films she would and would not make</span>
				<span class='text'>Crawford was quoted to have said, &quot;How can I compete with Norma? She sleeps with the boss!&quot;{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}In 1926, Crawford was named one of the [[WAMPAS Baby Stars]] along with [[Mary Astor]], [[Dolores del Río]], [[Janet Gaynor]], and [[Fay Wray]] among others</span>
				<span class='text'>That same year, she starred in ''[[Paris (1926 film)|Paris]]'', co-starring [[Charles Ray (actor)|Charles Ray]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Within a few years, she became the romantic female lead to many of MGM's top male stars, including [[Ramón Novarro]], [[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]], [[William Haines]], and [[Tim McCoy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=September 2015}}Crawford appeared in ''[[The Unknown (1927 film)|The Unknown]]'' (1927), starring [[Lon Chaney|Lon Chaney, Sr</span>
				<span class='text'>] who played a carnival knife thrower with no arms</span>
				<span class='text'>Crawford played his skimpily-clad young carnival assistant whom he hopes to marry</span>
				<span class='text'>She stated that she learned more about acting from watching Chaney work than from anyone else in her career</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;It was then,&quot; she said, &quot;I became aware for the first time of the difference between standing in front of a camera, and acting</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Also in 1927, she appeared alongside her close friend, [[William Haines]], in ''[[Spring Fever (1927 film)|Spring Fever]]'', which was the first of three movies the duo made together</span>

				<span class='text'>120&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, quoted in Skal, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>73&lt;/ref&gt;In 1928, Crawford starred opposite [[Ramón Novarro]] in ''[[Across to Singapore]]'', but it was her role as Diana Medford in ''[[Our Dancing Daughters]]'' (1928) that catapulted her to stardom</span>
				<span class='text'>The role established her as a symbol of modern 1920s-style femininity which rivaled [[Clara Bow]], the original It girl, then Hollywood's foremost [[flapper]]</span>
				<span class='text'>A stream of hits followed ''Our Dancing Daughters'', including two more flapper-themed movies, in which Crawford embodied for her legion of fans (many of whom were women) an idealized vision of the free-spirited, all-American girl</span>

				<span class='text'>Young things with a talent for living</span>
				<span class='text'>}On June 3, 1929, Crawford married [[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr</span>
				<span class='text'>] at [[Saint Malachy's Roman Catholic Church]] (known as &quot;The Actors' Chapel&quot; due to its proximity to Broadway theatres) in Manhattan, although neither was Catholic</span>

				<span class='text'>The transition from silent to sound panicked many—if not all—involved with the film industry; many silent film stars found themselves unemployable because of their undesirable voices and hard-to-understand accents or simply because of their refusal to make the transition to talkies</span>
				<span class='text'>Many studios and stars avoided making the transition as long as possible, especially MGM, which was the last studio to switch over to sound</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[The Hollywood Revue of 1929]]'' (1929) was one of the studio's first all-sound films, and their first attempt to showcase their stars' ability to make the transition from silent to sound</span>
				<span class='text'>Crawford was among the dozen or more MGM stars included in the movie; she sang the song &quot;Got a Feeling for You&quot; during the film's first act</span>
				<span class='text'>rawford made a successful transition to talkies</span>
				<span class='text'>Her first starring role in an all-sound feature-length film was in ''[[Untamed (1929 film)|Untamed]]'' in 1929, co-starring [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]]</span>

				<span class='text'>However, by the early 1960s, Crawford's status in motion pictures had declined considerably</span>

				<span class='text'>right|thumb|As [[Blanche Hudson]] in ''[[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962 film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]'' (1962)]]Crawford starred as Blanche Hudson, an old, wheelchair-bound former [[A-list]] movie star in conflict with her psychotic sister, in the highly successful psychological thriller ''[[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962 film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]'' (1962)</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite the actresses' earlier tensions, Crawford reportedly suggested [[Bette Davis]] for the role of Jane</span>
				<span class='text'>The two stars maintained publicly that there was no feud between them</span>
				<span class='text'>The director, [[Robert Aldrich]], explained that Davis and Crawford were each aware of how important the film was to their respective careers and commented, &quot;It's proper to say that they really detested each other, but they behaved absolutely perfectly</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Considine, ibid</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;After filming was completed, their public comments against each other propelled their animosity into a lifelong feud</span>
				<span class='text'>The film was a huge success, recouping its costs within 11 days of its nationwide release, and temporarily revived Crawford's career</span>
				<span class='text'>Davis was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance as Jane Hudson</span>
				<span class='text'>Crawford secretly contacted each of the other Oscar nominees in the category ([[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Geraldine Page]] and [[Anne Bancroft]], all East Coast-based actresses), to let them know that if they could not attend the ceremony, she would be happy to accept the Oscar on their behalf; all agreed</span>
				<span class='text'>Both Davis and Crawford were backstage when the absent [[Anne Bancroft]] was announced as the winner, and Crawford accepted the award on her behalf</span>
				<span class='text'>Davis claimed for the rest of her life that Crawford had campaigned against her, a charge Crawford denied</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=February 2014}}That same year, Crawford starred as Lucy Harbin in [[William Castle]]'s horror mystery ''[[Strait-Jacket]]'' (1964)</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Robert Aldrich]] cast Crawford and Davis in ''[[Hush</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Hush, Sweet Charlotte]]'' (1964)</span>
				<span class='text'>After a purported campaign of [[harassment]] by Davis on location in [[Louisiana]], Crawford returned to Hollywood and entered a hospital</span>
				<span class='text'>After a prolonged absence, during which Crawford was accused of feigning illness, Aldrich was forced to replace her with [[Olivia de Havilland]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Crawford claimed to be devastated, saying &quot;I heard the news of my replacement over the radio, lying in my hospital bed </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>I cried for 9 hours</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>225&lt;/ref&gt; Crawford nursed grudges against Davis and Aldrich for the rest of her life, saying of Aldrich, &quot;He is a man who loves evil, horrendous, vile things&quot;, to which Aldrich replied, &quot;If the shoe fits, wear it, and I am very fond of Miss Crawford</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Considine, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>363&lt;/ref&gt;In 1965 she played Amy Nelson in ''[[I Saw What You Did]]'' (1965), another William Castle vehicle</span>
				<span class='text'>She starred as Monica Rivers in [[Herman Cohen]]'s horror thriller film ''[[Berserk!]]'' (1967)</span>
				<span class='text'>After the film's release, Crawford guest-starred as herself on ''[[The Lucy Show]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The episode, &quot;Lucy and the Lost Star&quot;, first aired on February 26, 1968</span>
				<span class='text'>Crawford struggled during rehearsals and drank heavily on-set, leading series star [[Lucille Ball]] to suggest replacing her with [[Gloria Swanson]]</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Crawford was letter-perfect the day of the show, which included dancing the Charleston, and received two standing ovations from the studio audience</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Thomas, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>231&lt;/ref&gt;In October 1968, Crawford's 29-year-old daughter, Christina (who was then acting in New York on the [[CBS]] soap opera ''[[The Secret Storm]]''), needed immediate medical attention for a ruptured ovarian tumor</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite the fact that Christina's character was a 28-year-old and Crawford was 60, Crawford offered to play her role until Christina was well enough to return, to which producer [[Gloria Monty]] readily agreed</span>

				<span class='text'>Crawford's next book, ''My Way of Life'', was published in 1971 by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Those expecting a racy tell-all were disappointed, although Crawford's meticulous ways were revealed in her advice on grooming, wardrobe, exercise, and even food storage</span>

				<span class='text'>Her last public appearance was September 23, 1974, at a party honoring her old friend [[Rosalind Russell]] at New York's [[Rainbow Room]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Russell was suffering from breast cancer and [[arthritis]] at the time</span>

				<span class='text'>396&lt;/ref&gt; Crawford cancelled all public appearances, began declining interviews and left her apartment less and less</span>

				<span class='text'>While on antibiotics for this problem in October 1974, her drinking caused her to black out, slip and strike her face</span>
				<span class='text'>The incident scared her enough to give up drinking, although she &lt;!-- not &quot;publicly&quot; as she was a recluse by that time --&gt;insisted it was because of her return to Christian Science</span>
				<span class='text'>The incident is recorded in a series of letters sent to her insurance company held in the stack files on the 3rd floor of the [[New York Public Library for the Performing Arts]]; it is also documented by Carl Johnnes in his biography of the actress, ''Joan Crawford: The Last Years''</span>
