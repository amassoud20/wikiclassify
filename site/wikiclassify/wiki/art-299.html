				<span class='text'>The difficulty arises from the fact that in Haydn's day official records recorded not the birth date but the date of baptism, which, in Haydn's case, was 1 April (Wyn Jones 2009, p</span>

				<span class='text'>He was instrumental in the development of [[chamber music]] such as the [[piano trio]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Basil |last=Smallman |title=The Piano Trio: Its History, Technique, and Repertoire |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1992 |pages=16–19 |isbn=0-19-318307-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his contributions to [[musical form]] have earned him the epithets &quot;Father of the [[Symphony]]&quot; and &quot;Father of the [[String quartet|String Quartet]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|1997|pp=43–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;Haydn spent much of his career as a court musician for the wealthy [[House of Esterházy|Esterházy]] family at their remote estate</span>
				<span class='text'>Until the later part of his life, this isolated him from other composers and trends in music so that he was, as he put it, &quot;forced to become original&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref group=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Haydn made the remark to his friend and biographer [[Georg August Griesinger]]; cited from English version by Vernon Gotwals (Griesinger 1963:17)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Yet his music circulated widely and for much of his career he was the most celebrated composer in Europe</span>

				<span class='text'>=Biography==[[File:WhereHaydnLived</span>
				<span class='text'>NG|thumb|right|300px|Map showing locations where Haydn lived or visited (see [[List of residences of Joseph Haydn]])]]===Early life===Joseph Haydn was born in [[Rohrau, Austria|Rohrau]], [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]], a village that at that time stood on the border with [[Hungary]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His father was [[Mathias Haydn]], a [[wheelwright]] who also served as &quot;Marktrichter&quot;, an office akin to village mayor</span>
				<span class='text'>Haydn's mother Maria, {{née}} Koller, had previously worked as a cook in the palace of [[Aloys Thomas Raimund, Count Harrach|Count Harrach]], the presiding aristocrat of Rohrau</span>
				<span class='text'>Neither parent could read music;&lt;ref group=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Haydn reported this in his 1776 [[Autobiographical sketch (Haydn)|Autobiographical sketch]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; however, Mathias was an enthusiastic [[folk music]]ian, who during the journeyman period of his career had taught himself to play the [[harp]]</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Haydn's later reminiscences, his childhood family was extremely musical, and frequently sang together and with their neighbors</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dies|1963|pp=80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;Haydn's parents had noticed that their son was musically gifted and knew that in Rohrau he would have no chance to obtain serious musical training</span>
				<span class='text'>It was for this reason that, around the time Haydn turned six, they accepted a proposal from their relative Johann Matthias Frankh, the schoolmaster and choirmaster in [[Hainburg an der Donau|Hainburg]], that Haydn be apprenticed to Frankh in his home to train as a musician</span>
				<span class='text'>Haydn therefore went off with Frankh to Hainburg {{convert|12|km}} away; he never again lived with his parents</span>
				<span class='text'>Life in the Frankh household was not easy for Haydn, who later remembered being frequently hungry&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Griesinger|1963|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and humiliated by the filthy state of his clothing</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dies|1963|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began his musical training there, and could soon play both [[harpsichord]] and [[violin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The people of Hainburg heard him sing [[Boy soprano|treble]] parts in the church [[choir]]</span>
				<span class='text'>here is reason to think that Haydn's singing impressed those who heard him, because in 1739&lt;ref group=&quot;n&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Finscher|2000| p=12}}</span>
				<span class='text'>Jones (2009:7) dates the visit to early summer, i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>cherry season, since during the visit Reutter plied the child with fresh cherries as a means of inducing him to learn to sing a trill</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; he was brought to the attention of [[Georg von Reutter]], the director of music in [[St</span>
				<span class='text'>Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna|St</span>
				<span class='text'>Stephen's Cathedral]] in Vienna, who happened to be visiting Hainburg and was looking for new choirboys</span>
				<span class='text'>Haydn successfully auditioned with Reutter, and after several months of further training moved to Vienna (1740), where he worked for the next nine years as a chorister</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:KapellhausStStephensVienna</span>
				<span class='text'>NG|thumb|right|[[St</span>

				<span class='text'>Stephen's Cathedral]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In the foreground is the Kapellhaus (demolished 1804) where Haydn lived as a chorister</span>
				<span class='text'>]Haydn lived in the Kapellhaus next to the cathedral, along with Reutter, Reutter's family, and the other four choirboys, which after 1745 included his younger brother [[Michael Haydn|Michael]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jones (2009, 12–13)</span>
				<span class='text'>A third brother, [[Johann Evangelist Haydn]] also pursued a musical career as a tenor, but achieved no distinction and was for some time supported by Joseph</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The choirboys were instructed in Latin and other school subjects as well as voice, violin, and keyboard</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Finscher|2000|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reutter was of little help to Haydn in the areas of [[music theory]] and composition, giving him only two lessons in his entire time as chorister</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Griesinger|1963|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since St</span>
				<span class='text'>Stephen's was one of the leading musical centres in Europe, Haydn learned a great deal simply by serving as a professional musician there</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landon|Jones|1988|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;Like Frankh before him, Reutter did not always bother to make sure Haydn was properly fed</span>
				<span class='text'>As he later told his biographer [[Albert Christoph Dies]], Haydn was motivated to sing well, in hopes of gaining more invitations to perform before aristocratic audiences—where the singers were usually served refreshments</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dies|1963|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;===Struggles as a freelancer===By 1749, Haydn had matured physically to the point that he was no longer able to sing high choral parts</span>
				<span class='text'>Empress [[Maria Theresa]] herself complained to Reutter about his singing, calling it &quot;crowing&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Dies 1810, 89&quot;&gt;Dies (1810, 89)&lt;/ref&gt; One day, Haydn carried out a prank, snipping off the pigtail of a fellow chorister</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Dies 1810, 89&quot;/&gt; This was enough for Reutter: Haydn was first [[Caning|caned]], then summarily dismissed and sent into the streets</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Geiringer|1982|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had the good fortune to be taken in by a friend, Johann Michael Spangler, who shared his family's crowded garret room with Haydn for a few months</span>
				<span class='text'>Haydn immediately began his pursuit of a career as a freelance musician</span>
				<span class='text'>aydn struggled at first, working at many different jobs: as a music teacher, as a street serenader, and eventually, in 1752, as valet–accompanist for the Italian composer [[Nicola Porpora]], from whom he later said he learned &quot;the true fundamentals of composition&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Larsen|1980|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also briefly in [[Count Friedrich Wilhelm von Haugwitz]]'s employ, playing the organ in the Bohemian Chancellery chapel at the Judenplatz</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Rita Steblin, 'Haydns Orgeldienste &quot;in der damaligen Gräfl</span>
				<span class='text'>Haugwitzischen Kapelle&quot;', in: ''Wiener Geschichtsblätter'' 65/2000, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>124–34</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;While a chorister, Haydn had not received any systematic training in music theory and composition</span>
				<span class='text'>As a remedy, he worked his way through the [[counterpoint]] exercises in the text ''[[Gradus ad Parnassum]]'' by [[Johann Joseph Fux]] and carefully studied the work of [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]], whom he later acknowledged as an important influence</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Geiringer30&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Geiringer|1982|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;As his skills increased, Haydn began to acquire a public reputation, first as the composer of an opera, ''[[Der krumme Teufel]]'', &quot;The Limping Devil&quot;, written for the comic actor [[Johann Joseph Felix Kurz]], whose stage name was &quot;Bernardon&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The work was premiered successfully in 1753, but was soon closed down by the censors due to &quot;offensive remarks&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tom Beghin|author2=Sander M</span>

				<span class='text'>l/books?id=TFBILY-jSUsC&amp;pg=PA94|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haydn also noticed, apparently without annoyance, that works he had simply given away were being published and sold in local music shops</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Griesinger|1963|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1754 and 1756 Haydn also worked freelance for the court in Vienna</span>
				<span class='text'>He was among several musicians who were paid for services as supplementary musicians at balls given for the imperial children during carnival season, and as supplementary singers in the imperial chapel (the ''Hofkapelle'') in Lent and Holy Week</span>

				<span class='text'>265)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;With the increase in his reputation, Haydn eventually obtained aristocratic patronage, crucial for the career of a composer in his day</span>
				<span class='text'>Countess Thun,&lt;ref group=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Various individuals bore the title &quot;Countess Thun&quot; over time</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; having seen one of Haydn's compositions, summoned him and engaged him as her singing and keyboard teacher</span>

				<span class='text'>Webster expresses doubts, since the source is the early biography of [[Nicolas-Étienne Framery]], judged {{Harv|Webster|2002|p=1}} the least reliable of Haydn's early biographers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In 1756, Baron Carl Josef Fürnberg employed Haydn at his country estate, Weinzierl, where the composer wrote his first string quartets</span>
				<span class='text'>Fürnberg later recommended Haydn to [[Count Morzin]], who, in 1757,&lt;ref group=&quot;n&quot;&gt;This date is uncertain, since the early biography of {{Harvtxt|Griesinger|1963}} gives 1759</span>

				<span class='text'>Joseph Haydn had a long relationship, starting in 1779, with the singer [[Luigia Polzelli]], and was probably the father of her son Antonio {{Harv|Landon|Jones|1988|p=116}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Count Morzin soon suffered financial reverses that forced him to dismiss his musical establishment, but Haydn was quickly offered a similar job (1761) by Prince [[Paul II Anton Esterházy|Paul Anton]], head of the immensely wealthy [[House of Esterházy|Esterházy family]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Haydn's job title was only Vice-Kapellmeister, but he was immediately placed in charge of most of the Esterházy musical establishment, with the old Kapellmeister, [[Gregor Werner]], retaining authority only for church music</span>
				<span class='text'>When Werner died in 1766, Haydn was elevated to full Kapellmeister</span>

				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;1770]]As a &quot;house officer&quot; in the Esterházy establishment, Haydn wore [[livery]] and followed the family as they moved among their various palaces, most importantly the family's ancestral seat [[Schloss Esterházy]] in [[Eisenstadt]] and later on [[Esterháza]], a grand new palace built in rural Hungary in the 1760s</span>
				<span class='text'>Haydn had a huge range of responsibilities, including composition, running the orchestra, playing [[chamber music]] for and with his patrons, and eventually the mounting of operatic productions</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite this backbreaking workload,&lt;ref group=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Robbins Landon and Jones (1988, 100) write: &quot;Haydn's duties were crushing</span>
				<span class='text'>We can notice the effect in his handwriting, which becomes hastier as the 1770s turn to the 1780s: the notation starts to become ever more careless in the scores and the abbreviations multiply</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt; the job was in artistic terms a superb opportunity for Haydn</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref group=&quot;n&quot;&gt;This view is given, for instance, by {{Harvtxt|Webster|2002|p=13}} and {{Harvtxt|Landon|Jones|1988|p=37}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The Esterházy princes (Paul Anton, then from 1762–1790 [[Nikolaus Esterházy|Nikolaus I]]) were musical connoisseurs who appreciated his work and gave him daily access to his own small orchestra</span>
				<span class='text'>During the nearly thirty years that Haydn worked at the Esterházy court, he produced a flood of compositions, and his musical style continued to develop</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Nikolaus Esterhazy</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|upright|thumb|Prince [[Nikolaus Esterházy]], Haydn's most important patron]]Much of Haydn's activity at the time followed the specific musical interest of his patron Prince Nikolaus</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, in about 1765 the Prince obtained, and began to learn to play, the [[baryton]], an uncommon musical instrument similar to the bass [[viol]] but with a set of plucked sympathetic strings</span>
				<span class='text'>Haydn was commanded to provide music for the Prince to play, and over the next ten years produced about 200 works for this instrument in various ensembles, of which the most notable are the 126 [[Baryton trios (Haydn)|baryton trios]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Around 1775 the Prince abandoned the baryton and took up a new hobby: opera productions, previously a sporadic event for special occasions, became the focus of musical life at court, and the opera theater the Prince had built at Esterháza came to host a major season, with multiple productions each year</span>
				<span class='text'> Haydn served as director of the company, recruiting and training the singers and preparing and leading the performances</span>
				<span class='text'>He also wrote several of the operas performed (see [[List of operas by Joseph Haydn]]) and wrote substitution arias to insert into the operas of other composers</span>
				<span class='text'>779 was a watershed year for Haydn, as his contract was renegotiated: whereas previously all his compositions were the property of the Esterházy family, he now was permitted to write for others and sell his work to publishers</span>
				<span class='text'>Haydn soon shifted his emphasis in composition to reflect this (fewer operas, and more quartets and symphonies) and he negotiated with multiple publishers, both Austrian and foreign</span>
				<span class='text'>Of Haydn's new employment contract Jones writes,&lt;blockquote&gt;This single document acted as a catalyst in the next stage in Haydn's career, the achievement of international popularity</span>
				<span class='text'>By 1790 Haydn was in the paradoxical, if not bizarre, position of being Europe's leading composer, but someone who spent his time as a duty-bound Kapellmeister in a remote palace in the Hungarian countryside</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jones (2009b:136)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The new publication campaign resulted in the composition of a great number of new string quartets (the six-quartet sets of Op</span>
				<span class='text'>[[String Quartets, Op</span>
				<span class='text'>33 (Haydn)|33]], 50, 54/55, and 64)</span>
				<span class='text'>Haydn also composed in response to commissions from abroad: the [[Paris symphonies]] (1785–1786) and the original orchestral version of [[The Seven Last Words of Christ (Haydn)|The Seven Last Words of Christ]] (1786), a commission from [[Cadiz]], Spain</span>
				<span class='text'>he remoteness of Esterháza, which was farther from Vienna than Eisenstadt, led Haydn gradually to feel more isolated and lonely</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Geiringer|1982|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; He longed to visit Vienna because of his friendships there</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;For details see {{Harvnb|Geiringer|1982|loc=Chapter 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, a particularly important one was with [[Maria Anna von Genzinger]] (1754–93), the wife of Prince Nikolaus's personal physician in Vienna, who began a close, platonic, relationship with the composer in 1789</span>
				<span class='text'>Haydn wrote to Mrs</span>
				<span class='text'>Genzinger often, expressing his loneliness at Esterháza and his happiness for the few occasions on which he was able to visit her in Vienna; later on, Haydn wrote to her frequently from London</span>
				<span class='text'>Her premature death in 1793 was a blow to Haydn, and his [[Variations in F minor|F minor variations]] for piano, Hob</span>
				<span class='text'>XVII:6, may have been written in response to her death</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Geiringer|1982|p=316}}, citing Robbins Landon</span>

				<span class='text'>ng|upright|thumb|Portrait of Mozart by [[Joseph Lange]]]]Another friend in Vienna was [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], whom Haydn had met sometime around 1784</span>
				<span class='text'>According to later testimony by [[Michael Kelly (musician)|Michael Kelly]] and others, the two composers occasionally played in [[string quartet]]s together</span>
				<span class='text'>Haydn was hugely impressed with Mozart's work and praised it unstintingly to others</span>
				<span class='text'>Mozart evidently returned the esteem, as seen in his dedication of a set of six quartets, now called the [[Haydn Quartets (Mozart)|&quot;Haydn&quot; quartets]], to his friend</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Geiringer (1982, 96)&lt;/ref&gt; Since Anton had little need of Haydn's services, he was willing to let him travel, and the composer accepted a lucrative offer from [[Johann Peter Salomon]], a German violinist and  [[impresario]], to visit England and conduct new symphonies with a large orchestra</span>

				<span class='text'>It was the first time that the 58-year-old composer had seen the ocean</span>
				<span class='text'>Arriving in London, Haydn stayed with Salomon in [[Great Pulteney Street]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones 2009b:137&quot;&gt;Jones (2009b:137)&lt;/ref&gt; working in a borrowed studio at the [[Broadwood and Sons|Broadwood]] piano firm nearby</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Jones 2009b:137&quot;/&gt;It was the start of a very auspicious period for Haydn; both the 1791–1792 journey, along with a repeat visit in 1794–1795, were greatly successful</span>
				<span class='text'>Audiences flocked to Haydn's concerts; he augmented his fame and made large profits, thus becoming financially secure</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref group=&quot;n&quot;&gt;According to Jones, the London visits yielded a net profit of 15,000 florins</span>
				<span class='text'>Haydn continued to prosper after the visits and at his death left an estate valued at 55,713 florins</span>
				<span class='text'>These were substantial sums; for comparison, the house he bought in Gumpendorf in 1793 (and then remodeled) cost only 1370 florins (all figures from Jones 2009:144–46)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Burney]] reviewed the first concert thus: &quot;Haydn himself presided at the piano-forte; and the sight of that renowned composer so electrified the audience, as to excite an attention and a pleasure superior to any that had ever been caused by instrumental music in England</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref group=&quot;n&quot;&gt;From Burney's memoirs; quoted from {{Harvtxt|Landon|Jones|1988|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haydn made many new friends and, for a time, was involved in a romantic relationship with [[Rebecca Schroeter]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Musically, Haydn's visits to England generated some of his best-known work, including the ''[[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>94 (Haydn)|Surprise]]'', ''[[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>100 (Haydn)|Military]]'', ''[[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>103 (Haydn)|Drumroll]]'' and ''[[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>104 (Haydn)|London]]'' symphonies; the ''[[Opus 71, 74, the &quot;Apponyi&quot; quartets (1793)|Rider]]'' quartet; and the [[Piano Trio No</span>
				<span class='text'>39 (Haydn)|&quot;Gypsy Rondo&quot;]] piano trio</span>
				<span class='text'>he great success of the overall enterprise does not mean that the journeys were free of trouble</span>
				<span class='text'>Notably, his very first project, the commissioned opera ''[[L'anima del filosofo]]'' was duly written during the early stages of the trip, but the opera's impresario [[John Gallini]] was unable to obtain a license to permit opera performances in the theater he directed, the [[Her Majesty's Theatre|King's Theatre]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Haydn was well paid for the opera (300 pounds) but much time was wasted</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref group=&quot;n&quot;&gt;The premier performance did not take place until 1951, during the [[Florence May Festival]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Maria Callas]] sang the role of Euridice</span>
				<span class='text'>The opera and its history are discussed in {{Harvnb|Geiringer|1982|pp=342–43}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Thus only two new symphonies, [[Symphony No</span>

				<span class='text'>95]] and [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>96 (Haydn)|no</span>
				<span class='text'>96 &quot;''Miracle''&quot;]], could be premiered in the 12 concerts of Salomon's spring concert series</span>
				<span class='text'>Another problem arose from the jealously competitive efforts of a senior, rival orchestra, the Professional Concerts, who recruited Haydn's old pupil [[Ignaz Pleyel]] as a rival visiting composer; the two composers, refusing to play along with the concocted rivalry, dined together and put each other's symphonies on their concert programs</span>
				<span class='text'>he end of Salomon's series in June gave Haydn a rare period of relative leisure</span>
				<span class='text'> He spent some of the time in the country ([[Hertingfordbury]]), but also had time to travel, notably to Oxford, where he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University</span>

				<span class='text'>On Haydn's return, Beethoven came to Vienna and during the time up to the second London visit was Haydn's pupil</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Geiringer|1982|pp=131–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in Vienna, Haydn purchased a house for himself and his wife in the suburbs and started remodeling it</span>
				<span class='text'> He also arranged for the performance of some of London symphonies in local concerts</span>
				<span class='text'>y the time he arrived on his second journey to England, (1794-1795), Haydn had become a familiar figure on the London concert scene</span>
				<span class='text'>The 1794 season was dominated by Salomon's ensemble, as the Professional Concerts had abandoned their efforts</span>
				<span class='text'>The concerts included the premieres of the 99th, 100th, and 101st symphonies</span>
				<span class='text'>For 1795, Salomon had abandoned his own series, citing difficulty in obtaining ‘vocal performers of the first rank from abroad’, and Haydn joined forces with the Opera Concerts, headed by the violinist [[Giovanni Battista Viotti]]</span>
				<span class='text'>These were the venue of the last three symphonies, 102, 103, and 104</span>
				<span class='text'>The final benefit concert for Haydn (&quot;Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Haydn's night&quot;) at the end of the 1795 season was a great success and was perhaps the peak of his English career</span>
				<span class='text'>Haydn's biographer Griesinger wrote that Haydn ‘considered the days spent in England the happiest of his life</span>

				<span class='text'>Prince Anton had died, and his successor [[Nikolaus II, Prince Esterházy|Nikolaus II]] proposed that the Esterházy musical establishment be revived with Haydn serving again as Kapellmeister</span>
				<span class='text'>Haydn took up the position on a part-time basis</span>
				<span class='text'>He spent his summers with the Esterházys in Eisenstadt, and over the course of several years wrote six [[List of masses by Joseph Haydn|masses]] for them</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and wrote works for public performance</span>
				<span class='text'>In collaboration with his librettist and mentor [[Gottfried van Swieten]], and with funding from van Swieten's [[Gesellschaft der Associierten]], he composed his two great oratorios, ''[[The Creation (Haydn)|The Creation]]'' (1798) and ''[[The Seasons (Haydn)|The Seasons]]'' (1801)</span>
				<span class='text'>Both were enthusiastically received</span>
				<span class='text'>Haydn frequently appeared before the public, often leading performances of ''The Creation'' and ''The Seasons'' for charity benefits, including [[Tonkünstler-Societät]] programs with massed musical forces</span>
				<span class='text'>He also composed instrumental music: the popular ''[[Trumpet Concerto (Haydn)|Trumpet Concerto]]'', and the last nine in his long series of string quartets, including the ''[[String Quartets, Op</span>

				<span class='text'>4 (&quot;Sunrise&quot;)|Sunrise]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>A brief work, &quot;[[Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser]]&quot; (the &quot;Emperor's Hymn&quot;; 1797), achieved great success and became &quot;the enduring emblem of Austrian identity right up to the First World War&quot; (Jones); in modern times it became (with different words) the national anthem of Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>uring the later years of this successful period, Haydn faced incipient old age and fluctuating health, and he had to struggle to complete his final works</span>
				<span class='text'>His last major work, from 1802, was the sixth mass for the Esterházys, the ''[[Harmoniemesse]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>==Retirement, illness, and death===By the end of 1803, Haydn's condition had declined to the point that he became physically unable to compose</span>
				<span class='text'>He suffered from weakness, dizziness, inability to concentrate and painfully swollen legs</span>
				<span class='text'>Since diagnosis was uncertain in Haydn's time, it is unlikely that the precise illness can ever be identified, though Jones suggests [[arteriosclerosis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;For symptoms see (Jones 2009a:146); for the arteriosclerosis hypothesis see Jones (2009b:216)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The illness was especially hard for Haydn because the flow of fresh musical ideas waiting to be worked out as compositions (something he could no longer do) continued unabated</span>
				<span class='text'>His biographer Dies reported a conversation from 1806: &lt;blockquote&gt;[Haydn said] &quot;I must have something to do -- usually musical ideas are pursuing me, to the point of torture, I cannot escape them, they stand like walls before me</span>
				<span class='text'>If it's an [[allegro (music)|allegro]] that pursues me, my pulse keeps beating faster, I can get no sleep</span>
				<span class='text'>If it's an [[Adagio (music)|adagio]], then I notice my pulse beating slowly</span>
				<span class='text'>My imagination plays on me as if I were a clavier</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref group=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dies (1810:141)</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Clavier&quot; in the original German is ambiguous; literally &quot;keyboard,&quot; it is used by extension to denote a keyboard instrument such as the piano or harpsichord</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Haydn smiled, the blood rushed to his face, and he said &quot;I am really just a living clavier</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref group=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Of Haydn's plight Rosen (1971/1997) wrote, &quot;The last years of Haydn's life, with all his success, comfort, and celebrity, are among the saddest in music</span>
				<span class='text'>More moving than the false pathos of a [[Death of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|pauper's grave for Mozart]] </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>is the figure of Haydn filled with musical ideas which were struggling to escape, as he himself said; he was too old and weak to go to the piano and submit to the discipline of working them out</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The winding down of Haydn's career was gradual</span>
				<span class='text'>The Esterházy family kept him on as Kapellmeister to the very end (much as they had with his predecessor Werner long before), but they  appointed new staff to lead their musical establishment:  Johann Michael Fuchs in 1802 as Vice-Kapellmeister&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones 2009:209&quot;&gt;Jones (2009:209)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel]] as Konzertmeister in 1804</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jones (2009:214-215)&lt;/ref&gt; Haydn's last summer in Eisenstadt was in  1803,&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones 2009:209&quot;/&gt; and his last appearance before the public as a conductor was a charity performance of ''[[The Seven Last Words]]'' on 26 December 1803</span>
				<span class='text'>As debility set in, he made largely futile efforts at composition, attempting to revise a rediscovered ''[[Missa brevis (Haydn)|Missa brevis]]'' from his teenage years and complete his [[List of string quartets by Joseph Haydn#Opus 103|final string quartet]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The latter project was abandoned for good in 1805, and the quartet was published with just two movements</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jones (2009:213)&lt;/ref&gt;Haydn was well cared for by his servants, and he received many visitors and public honors during his last years, but they could not have been very happy years for him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref group=&quot;n&quot;&gt;This is the view of Geiringer (cited below, p</span>
				<span class='text'>198), who gives the testimony of Haydn's early biographer [[Giuseppe Carpani]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  During his illness, Haydn often found solace by sitting at the piano and playing his Emperor's hymn</span>
				<span class='text'> final triumph occurred on 27 March 1808 when a performance of ''The Creation'' was organized in his honor</span>
				<span class='text'>The very frail composer was brought into the hall on an armchair to the sound of trumpets and drums and was greeted by Beethoven, [[Antonio Salieri|Salieri]] (who led the performance) and by other musicians and members of the aristocracy&lt;!--Speculation?: , many of whom probably sensed that they were saying goodbye to the elderly composer--&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'>Haydn was both moved and exhausted by the experience and had to depart at intermission</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|The [[Bergkirche (Eisenstadt)|Bergkirche]] in Eisenstadt, site of Haydn's tomb]]Haydn lived on for 14 more months</span>
				<span class='text'> His final days were hardly serene, as in May 1809 the French army under [[Napoleon]] launched an attack on Vienna and on 10 May bombarded his neighborhood</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Griesinger, &quot;Four [[case shot]]s fell, rattling the windows and doors of his house</span>
				<span class='text'>He called out in a loud voice to his alarmed and frightened people, 'Don't be afraid, children, where Haydn is, no harm can reach you!'</span>
				<span class='text'>But the spirit was stronger than the flesh, for he had hardly uttered the brave words when his whole body began to tremble</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;On 26 May Haydn played his &quot;Emperor's Hymn&quot; with unusual gusto three times; the same evening he collapsed and was taken to what proved to be to his deathbed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Griesinger 1810:50&quot;/&gt; He died peacefully at 12:40&amp;nbsp;a</span>

				<span class='text'>These same traits, and his connection to the aristocracy contributed to the decline in his reputation in the nineteenth century: {{Harvnb|Proksch|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haydn was especially respected by the Esterházy court musicians whom he supervised, as he maintained a cordial working atmosphere and effectively represented the musicians' interests with their employer; see [[Papa Haydn]] and the tale of the [[Symphony No</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Larsen|1980|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;Haydn's primary character flaw was greed as it related to his business dealings</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> He always attempted to maximize his income, whether by negotiating the right to sell his music outside the Esterházy court, driving hard bargains with publishers or selling his works three and four times over; he regularly engaged in 'sharp practice' and occasionally in outright fraud</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;Haydn was short in stature, perhaps as a result of having been underfed throughout most of his youth</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> He is familiarly known as the 'father of the symphony' and could with greater justice be thus regarded for the string quartet; no other composer approaches his combination of productivity, quality and historical importance in these genres</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;''New Grove'', online edition, article &quot;Joseph Haydn&quot;; accessed 3 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;===Structure and character of his music===A central characteristic of Haydn's music is the development of larger structures out of very short, simple musical [[Motif (music)|motifs]], often derived from standard accompanying figures</span>
				<span class='text'>The music is often quite formally concentrated, and the important musical events of a movement can unfold rather quickly</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref group=&quot;n&quot;&gt;{{Harvtxt|Sutcliffe|1989|p=343}} mentions this in a criticism of contemporary Haydn performance practice: &quot;[Haydn's] music sometime seems to 'live on its nerves'&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>It is above all in this respect that Haydn performances often fail, whereby most interpreters lack the mental agility to deal with the ever-changing 'physiognomy' of Haydn's music, subsiding instead into an ease of manner and a concern for broader effects that they have acquired in their playing of Mozart</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt;Haydn's work was central to the development of what came to be called [[sonata form]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His practice, however, differed in some ways from that of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], his younger contemporaries who likewise excelled in this form of composition</span>
				<span class='text'>Haydn was particularly fond of the so-called [[Sonata form#Monothematic expositions|&quot;monothematic exposition&quot;]], in which the music that establishes the dominant key is similar or identical to the opening theme</span>
				<span class='text'>Haydn also differs from Mozart and Beethoven in his [[Recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]] sections, where he often rearranges the order of themes compared to the exposition and uses extensive thematic development</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref group=&quot;n&quot;&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hughes|1970|p=112}} writes: &quot;Having begun to 'develop', he could not stop; his recapitulations begin to take on irregular contours, sometimes sharply condensed, sometimes surprisingly expanded, losing their first tame symmetry to regain a balance of a far higher and more satisfying order</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt;Haydn's formal inventiveness also led him to integrate the [[fugue]] into the classical style and to enrich the rondo form with more cohesive tonal logic (see [[sonata rondo form]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Haydn was also the principal exponent of the [[double variation]] form—variations on two alternating themes, which are often major- and minor-mode versions of each other</span>
				<span class='text'>erhaps more than any other composer's, Haydn's music is known for its humor</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref group=&quot;n&quot;&gt;See, for instance, {{Harvtxt|Brendel|2001}}, which focuses on the humor of Haydn and Beethoven</span>
				<span class='text'>Rosen (1997:111) attributes to Haydn &quot;an aptitude for the facetious that no other composer enjoyed</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous example is the sudden loud chord in the slow movement of his [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>94 (Haydn)|&quot;Surprise&quot; symphony]]; Haydn's many other musical jokes include numerous false endings (e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> in the quartets [[String Quartets, Op</span>
				<span class='text'>33 (Haydn)|Op</span>
				<span class='text'>33 No</span>
				<span class='text'>2]] and [[List of string quartets by Joseph Haydn#Opus 50 (1787)|Op</span>
				<span class='text'>50 No</span>
				<span class='text'>3]]), and the remarkable rhythmic illusion placed in the trio section of the third movement of [[List of string quartets by Joseph Haydn#Opus 50 (1787)|Op</span>
				<span class='text'>50 No</span>
				<span class='text'>1]]</span>
				<span class='text'>uch of the music was written to please and delight a prince, and its emotional tone is correspondingly upbeat</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} This tone also reflects, perhaps, Haydn's fundamentally healthy and well-balanced personality</span>
				<span class='text'>Occasional minor-key works, often deadly serious in character, form striking exceptions to the general rule</span>
				<span class='text'>Haydn's fast movements tend to be rhythmically propulsive and often impart a great sense of energy, especially in the finales</span>
				<span class='text'>Some characteristic examples of Haydn's &quot;rollicking&quot; finale type are found in the [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>104 (Haydn)|&quot;London&quot; symphony]] No</span>
				<span class='text'>104, the string quartet Op</span>
				<span class='text'>50 No</span>
				<span class='text'>1, and the piano trio Hob XV: 27</span>
				<span class='text'>Haydn's early slow movements are usually not too slow in tempo, relaxed, and reflective</span>
				<span class='text'>Later on, the emotional range of the slow movements increases, notably in the deeply felt slow movements of the quartets Op</span>
				<span class='text'>76 Nos</span>
				<span class='text'>3 and 5, the Symphonies No</span>
				<span class='text'>98 and [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>102 (Haydn)|102]], and the piano trio Hob XV: 23</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[minuets]] tend to have a strong downbeat and a clearly popular character</span>
				<span class='text'>Over time, Haydn turned some of his minuets into &quot;scherzi&quot; which are much faster, at one beat to the bar</span>
				<span class='text'>==Evolution of Haydn's style===Haydn's early work dates from a period in which the compositional style of the High [[Baroque music|Baroque]] (seen in [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]) had gone out of fashion</span>
				<span class='text'>This was a period of exploration and uncertainty, and Haydn, born 18 years before the death of Bach, was himself one of the musical explorers of this time</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref group=&quot;n&quot;&gt;{{Harvtxt|Rosen|1997|p=57}} writes, &quot;the period from 1750 to 1775 was penetrated by eccentricity, hit-or-miss experimentation, resulting in works which are still difficult to accept today because of their oddities</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Similar remarks are made by {{Harvtxt|Hughes|1970|pp=111–112}}&lt;/ref&gt; An older contemporary whose work Haydn acknowledged as an important influence was [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Geiringer30&quot; /&gt;Tracing Haydn's work over the six decades in which it was produced (roughly from 1749 to 1802), one finds a gradual but steady increase in complexity and musical sophistication, which developed as Haydn learned from his own experience and that of his colleagues</span>
				<span class='text'>Several important landmarks have been observed in the evolution of Haydn's musical style</span>
				<span class='text'>n the late 1760s and early 1770s, Haydn entered a stylistic period known as &quot;[[Sturm und Drang]]&quot; (&quot;storm and stress&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>This term is taken from [[Sturm und Drang|a literary movement]] of about the same time, though it appears that the musical development actually preceded the literary one by a few years</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref group=&quot;n&quot;&gt;See {{Harvtxt|Webster|2002|p=18}}: &quot;the term has been criticized: taken from the title of a play of 1776 by [[Friedrich Maximilian Klinger|Maximilian Klinger]], it properly pertains to a literary movement of the middle and late 1770s rather than a musical one of about 1768–1772</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The musical language of this period is similar to what went before, but it is deployed in work that is more intensely expressive, especially in the works in minor keys</span>
				<span class='text'>James Webster describes the works of this period as &quot;longer, more passionate, and more daring</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Webster|2002|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most famous compositions of this time are the &quot;Trauer&quot; (Mourning) Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>44, [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>45 (Haydn)|&quot;Farewell&quot; Symphony]] No</span>
				<span class='text'>45, the piano sonata in C minor (Hob</span>
				<span class='text'>XVI/20, L</span>
				<span class='text'>33), and the [[String Quartets, Op</span>
				<span class='text'>20 (Haydn)|six string quartets of Op</span>
				<span class='text'>20]] (the &quot;Sun&quot; quartets), all from c</span>
				<span class='text'>1771–72</span>
				<span class='text'>It was also around this time that Haydn became interested in writing [[fugue]]s in the Baroque style, and three of the Op</span>
				<span class='text'>20 quartets end with a fugue</span>
				<span class='text'>ollowing the climax of the &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot;, Haydn returned to a lighter, more overtly entertaining style</span>
				<span class='text'>There are no quartets from this period, and the symphonies take on new features: the scoring often includes trumpets and [[timpani]]</span>
				<span class='text'>These changes are often related to a major shift in Haydn's professional duties, which moved him away from &quot;pure&quot; music and toward the production of [[Opera buffa|comic operas]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Several of the operas were Haydn's own work (see [[List of operas by Joseph Haydn]]); these are seldom performed today</span>
				<span class='text'>Haydn sometimes recycled his opera music in symphonic works,&lt;ref&gt;Webster and Feder 2001, section 3</span>
				<span class='text'>ii&lt;/ref&gt; which helped him continue his career as a symphonist during this hectic decade</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1779, an important change in Haydn's contract permitted him to publish his compositions without prior authorization from his employer</span>
				<span class='text'>This may have encouraged Haydn to rekindle his career as a composer of &quot;pure&quot; music</span>
				<span class='text'>The change made itself felt most dramatically in 1781, when Haydn published the [[String Quartets, Op</span>
				<span class='text'>33 (Haydn)|six string quartets of Opus 33]], announcing (in a letter to potential purchasers) that they were written in &quot;a new and completely special way&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref group=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Original German &quot;Neu, gantz besonderer Art&quot;; Sisman (1993, 219)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Rosen]] has argued that this assertion on Haydn's part was not just sales talk, but meant quite seriously; and he points out a number of important advances in Haydn's compositional technique that appear in these quartets, advances that mark the advent of the [[Classical music era|Classical]] style in full flower</span>
				<span class='text'>These include a fluid form of phrasing, in which each motif emerges from the previous one without interruption, the practice of letting accompanying material evolve into melodic material, and a kind of &quot;Classical [[counterpoint]]&quot; in which each instrumental part maintains its own integrity</span>
				<span class='text'>These traits continue in the many quartets that Haydn wrote after Opus 33</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref group=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Rosen's case that Opus 33 represents a &quot;revolution in style&quot; (1971 and 1997, 116) can be found in chapter III</span>
				<span class='text'> of (Rosen 1971 and 1997)</span>
				<span class='text'>For dissenting views, see {{Harvtxt|Larsen|1980|p=102}} and {{Harvtxt|Webster|1991}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In the 1790s, stimulated by his England journeys, Haydn developed what Rosen calls his &quot;popular style&quot;, a method of composition that, with unprecedented success, created music having great popular appeal but retaining a learned and rigorous musical structure</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref group=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Rosen discusses the popular style in ch</span>
				<span class='text'>VI</span>
				<span class='text'> of Rosen (1971 and 1997)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; An important element of the popular style was the frequent use of [[folk music|folk]] or folk-like material, as discussed in the article [[Haydn and folk music]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Haydn took care to deploy this material in appropriate locations, such as the endings of sonata expositions or the opening themes of finales</span>
				<span class='text'>In such locations, the folk material serves as an element of stability, helping to anchor the larger structure</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Rosen (1997 and 2001), 333–337&lt;/ref&gt; Haydn's popular style can be heard in virtually all of his later work, including the twelve [[London symphonies]], the late quartets and piano trios, and the two late [[oratorio]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>he return to Vienna in 1795 marked the last turning point in Haydn's career</span>
				<span class='text'>Although his musical style evolved little, his intentions as a composer changed</span>
				<span class='text'>While he had been a servant, and later a busy entrepreneur, Haydn wrote his works quickly and in profusion, with frequent deadlines</span>
				<span class='text'>As a rich man, Haydn now felt that he had the privilege of taking his time and writing for posterity</span>
				<span class='text'>This is reflected in the subject matter of ''[[The Creation (Haydn)|The Creation]]'' (1798) and ''[[The Seasons (Haydn)|The Seasons]]'' (1801), which address such weighty topics as the meaning of life and the purpose of humankind, and represent an attempt to render the sublime in music</span>
				<span class='text'>Haydn's new intentions also meant that he was willing to spend much time on a single work: both oratorios took him over a year to complete</span>
				<span class='text'>Haydn once remarked that he had worked on ''The Creation'' so long because he wanted it to last</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Geiringer|1982|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;The change in Haydn's approach was important in the [[history of classical music traditions|history of classical music]], as other composers were soon following his lead</span>
				<span class='text'>Notably, Beethoven adopted the practice of taking his time and aiming high</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref group=&quot;n&quot;&gt;For discussion, see [[Antony Hopkins]] (1981) ''The Nine Symphonies of Beethoven'', Heinemann, London, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>7–8</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Identifying Haydn's works===Haydn's works are listed in a comprehensive catalogue prepared by [[Anthony van Hoboken]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This [[Hoboken-Verzeichnis|Hoboken catalogue]] provides each work with an identifying number, called its Hoboken number (abbreviation: H</span>
				<span class='text'>or Hob</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>The string quartets also have Hoboken numbers, but are usually identified instead by their [[opus number]]s, which have the advantage of indicating the groups of six quartets that Haydn published together; thus for example the string quartet [[String Quartets, Op</span>
				<span class='text'>76 (Haydn)#Opus 76 No</span>
