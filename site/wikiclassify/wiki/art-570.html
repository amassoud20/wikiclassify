				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The origins of the [[Wallace (surname)|Wallace surname]] and its association with southwest Scotland are also far from certain, other than the name's being derived from the [[Old English]] ''wylisc'' (pronounced &quot;wullish&quot;), meaning &quot;foreigner&quot; or &quot;Welshman&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>It is possible that all the Wallaces in the [[River Clyde|Clyde]] area were medieval immigrants from Wales, but as the term was also used for local Cumbric-speaking Strathclyde Welsh, it seems equally likely that the surname refers to people who were seen as being &quot;Welsh&quot; due to their [[Cumbric language]]</span>

				<span class='text'>PG|left|thumb|Coronation of Alexander]]When Wallace was growing up, King [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]]&lt;ref&gt;(Medieval Gaelic: Alaxandair mac Alaxandair; Modern Gaelic: Alasdair mac Alasdair)&lt;/ref&gt; ruled Scotland</span>
				<span class='text'>His reign had seen a period of peace and economic stability</span>
				<span class='text'>On 19 March 1286, however, Alexander died after falling from his horse</span>
				<span class='text'>he heir to the throne was Alexander's granddaughter, [[Margaret, Maid of Norway]]</span>
				<span class='text'>As she was still a child and in Norway, the Scottish lords set up a government of guardians</span>
				<span class='text'> Margaret fell ill on the voyage to Scotland and died in Orkney on 26 September 1290</span>
				<span class='text'>The lack of a clear heir led to a period known as the &quot;Great Cause&quot;, with several families laying claim to the throne</span>
				<span class='text'>ith Scotland threatening to descend into civil war, King [[Edward I of England]] was invited in by the Scottish nobility to arbitrate</span>
				<span class='text'>Before the process could begin, he insisted that all of the contenders recognise him as [[Lord Paramount of Scotland]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In early November 1292, at a great feudal court held in the castle at [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]], judgement was given in favour of [[John Balliol]] having the strongest claim in law</span>
				<span class='text'>dward proceeded to reverse the rulings of the Scottish Lords and even summoned King John Balliol to stand before the English court as a common plaintiff</span>
				<span class='text'>John was a weak king, known as &quot;Toom Tabard&quot; or &quot;Empty Coat&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>John renounced his [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] in March 1296 and by the end of the month Edward stormed Berwick-upon-Tweed, sacking the then-Scottish border town</span>
				<span class='text'> In April, the Scots were defeated at the [[Battle of Dunbar (1296)|Battle of Dunbar]] in [[East Lothian]] and by July, Edward had forced John to abdicate</span>
				<span class='text'>Edward then instructed his officers to receive formal homage from some 1,800 Scottish nobles (many of the rest being prisoners of war at that time)</span>

				<span class='text'>Stevenson on the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, [[Edinburgh]]]]The first act definitely known to have been carried out by Wallace was his [[action at Lanark|assassination of William de Heselrig]], the English [[High Sheriff]] of Lanark, in May 1297</span>
				<span class='text'> He then joined with [[William the Hardy, Lord of Douglas]], and they carried out the [[raid of Scone]]</span>
				<span class='text'> This was one of several rebellions taking place across Scotland, including those of several Scottish nobles and [[Andrew Moray]] in the north</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=traquair/&gt;The uprising suffered a blow when the nobles submitted to the English at [[Irvine, Scotland|Irvine]] in July</span>
				<span class='text'> Wallace and Moray were not involved, and continued their rebellions</span>
				<span class='text'> Wallace used the [[Selkirkshire|Ettrick Forest]] as a base for raiding, and attacked [[Robert Wishart|Wishart]]'s palace at [[Ancrum]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Wallace and Moray met and joined their forces, possibly at the siege of Dundee in early September</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=traquair/&gt;==Battle of Stirling Bridge=={{Main|Battle of Stirling Bridge}}[[File:SterlingBridge</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|The later Stirling Bridge]]On 11 September 1297, an army jointly led by Wallace and [[Andrew Moray]] won the [[Battle of Stirling Bridge]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Although vastly outnumbered, the Scottish army routed the English army</span>
				<span class='text'>[[John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey]]'s professional army of 3,000 cavalry and 8,000 to 10,000 infantry met disaster as they crossed over to the north side of the river</span>
				<span class='text'>The narrowness of the bridge prevented many soldiers from crossing together (possibly as few as three men abreast), so, while the English soldiers crossed, the Scots held back until half of them had passed and then killed the English as quickly as they could cross</span>
				<span class='text'>The infantry were sent on first, followed by heavy cavalry</span>
				<span class='text'>The Scots' [[schiltron]] formations forced the infantry back into the advancing cavalry</span>
				<span class='text'>A pivotal charge, led by one of Wallace's captains, caused some of the English soldiers to retreat as others pushed forward, and under the overwhelming weight, the bridge collapsed and many English soldiers drowned</span>
				<span class='text'> Thus, the Scots won a significant victory, boosting the confidence of their army</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Hugh Cressingham]], Edward's treasurer in Scotland, died in the fighting and it is reputed that his body was subsequently flayed and the skin cut into small pieces as tokens of the victory</span>
				<span class='text'>The Lanercost Chronicle records that Wallace had &quot;a broad strip [of Cressingham’s skin] </span>
				<span class='text'></span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;After the battle, Moray and Wallace assumed the title of Guardians of the Kingdom of Scotland on behalf of King [[John Balliol]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Moray died of wounds suffered on the battlefield sometime in late 1297</span>
				<span class='text'>he type of engagement conducted by Wallace was characterized by opportunistic tactics and the strategic use of terrain</span>
				<span class='text'>This was in stark contrast to the contemporary views on chivalric warfare which were characterized by strength of arms and knightly combat</span>
				<span class='text'>Therefore, the battle embittered relations between the two antagonistic nations, whilst also perhaps providing a new departure in the type of warfare which England had hitherto employed</span>
				<span class='text'>The numerical and material inferiority of the Scottish forces would be mirrored by that of the English in the [[Hundred Years' War]], who, in turn, abandoned chivalric warfare to achieve decisive victory in similar engagements such as [[Battle of Crécy|Crécy]] and [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)|Poitiers]]</span>
				<span class='text'>round November 1297, Wallace led a large-scale raid into northern England, through Northumberland and Cumberland</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|[[William Wallace Statue, Aberdeen]]]]In April 1298, Edward ordered a second invasion of Scotland</span>
				<span class='text'>Two days prior to the battle 25,781 foot soldiers were paid</span>
				<span class='text'>More than half of them would have been Welsh</span>
				<span class='text'>There are no clear cut sources for the presence of cavalry, but it is safe to assume that Edward had roughly 1500 horse under his command</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Watson|first1=Fiona|title=Under the Hammer: Edward I and Scotland|date=1998|publisher=Tuckwell Press|pages=88ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; They plundered [[Lothian]] and regained some castles, but failed to bring William Wallace to combat; the Scots shadowed the English army, intending to avoid battle until shortages of supplies and money forced Edward to withdraw, at which point the Scots would harass his retreat</span>
				<span class='text'> The English quartermasters' failure to prepare for the expedition left morale and food supplies low, and a resulting riot within Edward's own army had to be put down by his cavalry</span>
				<span class='text'>In July, while planning a return to [[Edinburgh]] for supplies, Edward received intelligence that the Scots were encamped nearby at Falkirk, and he moved quickly to engage them in the pitched battle he had long hoped for</span>
				<span class='text'>allace arranged his spearmen in four [[schiltron]]s — circular, defensive hedgehog formations, probably surrounded by wooden stakes connected with ropes, to keep the infantry in formation</span>
				<span class='text'>The English, however, employed Welsh [[longbowmen]], who swung strategic superiority in their favour</span>
				<span class='text'>The English proceeded to attack with cavalry and put the Scottish archers to flight</span>
				<span class='text'>The Scottish cavalry withdrew as well, due to its inferiority to the English heavy horse</span>
				<span class='text'>Edward's men began to attack the schiltrons, which were still able to inflict heavy casualties on the English cavalry</span>
				<span class='text'>It remains unclear whether the infantry shooting bolts, arrows and stones at the spearmen proved the deciding factor, although it is very likely that it was the arrows of Edward's bowmen</span>
				<span class='text'>Gaps in the schiltrons soon appeared, and the English exploited these to crush the remaining resistance</span>
				<span class='text'>The Scots lost many men, including [[John de Graham]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Wallace escaped, though his military reputation suffered badly</span>
				<span class='text'>y September 1298, Wallace resigned as Guardian of Scotland in favour of [[Robert the Bruce]], Earl of Carrick and future king, and [[John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch]], King John Balliol's nephew</span>
				<span class='text'>etails of Wallace's activities after this are vague, but there is some evidence that he left on a mission to the court of King [[Philip IV of France]] to plead the case for assistance in the Scottish struggle for independence</span>
				<span class='text'> There is a surviving letter from the French king dated 7 November 1300 to his envoys in Rome demanding that they should help Sir William</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|The [[Wallace Monument]], near Stirling Bridge]]Although there are problems with writing a satisfactory biography of many medieval people, the problems with Wallace are greater than usual</span>
				<span class='text'> Not much is known about him beyond his military campaign of 1297–1298, and the last few weeks of his life in 1305</span>
				<span class='text'> Even in recent years, his birthplace and his father's name have been argued</span>
				<span class='text'>o compound this, the legacy of subsequent 'biographical' accounts, sometimes written as propaganda, other times simply as entertainment, has clouded much scholarship until relatively recent times</span>
				<span class='text'>Some accounts have uncritically copied elements from the epic poem, ''The Acts and Deeds of Sir William Wallace, Knight of Elderslie'', written around 1470 by [[Blind Harry]] the minstrel</span>
				<span class='text'> Harry wrote from oral tradition describing events 170 years earlier, and is not in any sense an authoritative descriptor of Wallace's exploits</span>
				<span class='text'> Much of the poem is clearly at variance with known historical facts and records of the period and is either fabricated using traditional chivalric motifs or 'borrowed' from the exploits of others and attributed to Wallace</span>
