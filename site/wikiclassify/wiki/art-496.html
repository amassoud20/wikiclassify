				<span class='text'>Moritz]]|Ladies' singles}}}}'''Sonja Henie''' (8 April 1912 – 12 October 1969) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[figure skating|figure skater]] and film star</span>
				<span class='text'>She was a three-time [[List of Olympic medalists in figure skating|Olympic Champion]] ([[Figure skating at the 1928 Winter Olympics|1928]], [[Figure skating at the 1932 Winter Olympics|1932]], [[Figure skating at the 1936 Winter Olympics|1936]]) in Ladies' Singles, a ten-time [[World Figure Skating Championships|World Champion]] (1927–1936) and a six-time [[European Figure Skating Championships|European Champion]] (1931–1936)</span>
				<span class='text'>Henie won more Olympic and World titles than any other ladies' figure skater</span>
				<span class='text'>At the height of her acting career she was one of the highest paid stars in [[Hollywood]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Retrieved on 2015-08-19</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Biography=====Early life===Henie was born in Kristiania, current [[Oslo]], the only daughter of [[Wilhelm Henie]] (1872–1937), a prosperous Norwegian [[fur clothing|furrier]], and his wife Selma Lochmann-Nielsen (1888–1961)</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition to the income from the fur business, both of Henie's parents had inherited wealth</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilhelm Henie had been a one-time [[UCI Track Cycling World Championships|World Cycling Champion]] and the Henie children were encouraged to take up a variety of sports at a young age</span>
				<span class='text'>Henie initially showed talent at [[skiing]], and then followed her older brother Leif to take up [[figure skating]]</span>
				<span class='text'>As a girl, Henie was also a nationally ranked [[tennis]] player and a skilled [[swimming (sport)|swimmer]] and [[equestrianism|equestrienne]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Once Henie began serious training as a figure skater, her formal schooling ended</span>
				<span class='text'>She was educated by tutors, and her father hired the best experts in the world, including the famous Russian ballerina [[Tamara Karsavina]], to transform his daughter into a sporting celebrity</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Competitive career===Henie won her first major competition, the senior Norwegian championships, at the age of 10</span>
				<span class='text'>She then placed eighth in a field of eight at the [[1924 Winter Olympics]], at the age of eleven</span>

				<span class='text'>sports-reference</span>
				<span class='text'>om&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1924 program, she skated over to the side of the rink several times to ask her coach for directions, but by the next Olympiad, she needed no such assistance</span>
				<span class='text'>enie won the first of an unprecedented ten consecutive World Figure Skating Championships in 1927 at the age of fourteen</span>
				<span class='text'>The results of 1927 World Championships, where Henie won in 3–2 decision (or 7 vs</span>
				<span class='text'>8 ordinal points) over the defending Olympic and World Champion [[Herma Szabo]] of [[Austria]], was controversial, as three of the five judges that gave Henie first-place ordinals were Norwegian (1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 7 points) while Szabo received first-place ordinals from an Austrian and a German Judge (1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8 points)</span>
				<span class='text'>Henie went on to win first of her three [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] gold medals the following year</span>
				<span class='text'>She defended her Olympic titles in 1932 and in 1936, and her world titles annually until 1936</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=sr/&gt; She also won six consecutive European championships from 1931 to 1936</span>
				<span class='text'>Henie's unprecedented three Olympic gold medals haven't been matched by any ladies' single skater since; neither are her achievements as ten-time consecutive World Champion</span>
				<span class='text'>While [[Irina Slutskaya]] of Russia won her seventh European Championship in 2006 to become the most successful ladies' skater in European Championships, Henie retains record of most consecutive titles, sharing it with [[Katarina Witt]] of [[Eastern Germany]]/[[Germany]] (1983–1988)</span>
				<span class='text'>owards the end of her career, she began to be strongly challenged by younger skaters including [[Cecilia Colledge]], [[Megan Taylor]] and [[Hedy Stenuf]]</span>
				<span class='text'>However, she held off these competitors and went on to win her third Olympic title at the [[1936 Winter Olympics]], albeit in very controversial circumstances with Cecilia Colledge finishing a very close second</span>
				<span class='text'>Indeed, after the school figures section at the 1936 Olympic competition, Colledge and Henie were virtually neck and neck with Colledge trailing by just a few points</span>
				<span class='text'>As Sandra Stevenson recounted in her article in ''[[The Independent]]'' of 21 April 2008, &quot;the closeness [of the competition] infuriated Henie, who, when the result for that section was posted on a wall in the competitors' lounge, swiped the piece of paper and tore it into little pieces</span>
				<span class='text'>The draw for the free skating [then] came under suspicion after Henie landed the plum position of skating last, while Colledge had to perform second of the 26 competitors</span>
				<span class='text'>The early start was seen as a disadvantage, with the audience not yet whipped into a clapping frenzy and the judges known to become freer with their higher marks as the event proceeded</span>
				<span class='text'>Years later, a fairer, staggered draw was adopted to counteract this situation&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>uring her competitive career, Henie traveled widely and worked with a variety of foreign coaches</span>
				<span class='text'>At home in Oslo, she trained at [[Frogner|Frogner Stadium]], where her coaches included Hjørdis Olsen and Oscar Holte</span>
				<span class='text'>During the latter part of her competitive career she was coached primarily by the American Howard Nicholson in [[London]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition to traveling to train and compete, she was much in demand as a performer at figure skating exhibitions in both Europe and North America</span>
				<span class='text'>Henie became so popular with the public that police had to be called out for crowd control on her appearances in various disparate cities such as [[Prague]] and [[New York City]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It was an open secret that, in spite of the strict [[amateur sports|amateurism]] requirements of the time, Wilhelm Henie demanded &quot;expense money&quot; for his daughter's skating appearances</span>
				<span class='text'>Both of Henie's parents had given up their own pursuits in Norway—leaving Leif to run the fur business—in order to accompany Sonja on her travels and act as her managers</span>
				<span class='text'>enie is credited with being the first figure skater to adopt the short skirt costume in figure skating, wear white boots, and make use of dance [[choreography]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Her innovative skating techniques and glamorous demeanor transformed the sport permanently and confirmed its acceptance as a legitimate sport in the Winter Olympics</span>

				<span class='text'>]After the 1936 [[World Figure Skating Championships]], Henie gave up her amateur status and took up a career as a professional performer in acting and live shows</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=sr/&gt; While still a girl, Henie had decided that she wanted to move to [[Hollywood]] and become a movie star when her competitive days were over, without considering that her thick accent might hinder her acting ambitions</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1936, following a successful ice show in [[Los Angeles]] orchestrated by her father to launch her film career, Hollywood studio chief [[Darryl Zanuck]] signed her to a long term contract at [[Twentieth Century Fox]], which made her one of the highest-paid actresses of the time</span>
				<span class='text'>After the success of her first film, ''One in a Million'', Henie's position was assured and she became increasingly demanding in her business dealings with Zanuck</span>
				<span class='text'>Henie also insisted on having total control of the skating numbers in her films such as ''[[Second Fiddle (1939 film)|Second Fiddle]]'' (1939)</span>
				<span class='text'>n addition to her film career at Fox, Henie formed a business arrangement with [[Arthur Wirtz]], who produced her touring ice shows under the name of &quot;Hollywood Ice Revue&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Wirtz also acted as Henie's financial advisor</span>
				<span class='text'>At the time, figure skating and ice shows were not yet an established form of entertainment in the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>Henie's popularity as a film actress attracted many new fans and instituted skating shows as a popular new entertainment</span>
				<span class='text'>Throughout the 1940s, Henie and Wirtz produced lavish musical ice skating extravaganzas at [[Rockefeller Center]]'s [[Center Theatre (New York, New York)|Center Theatre]] attracting millions of ticket buyers</span>
				<span class='text'>t the height of her fame, her shows and touring activities brought Henie as much as $2 million per year</span>
				<span class='text'>She also had numerous lucrative endorsement contracts, and deals to market skates, clothing, jewelry, dolls, and other merchandise branded with her name</span>
				<span class='text'>These activities made her one of the wealthiest women in the world in her time</span>

				<span class='text'>]Henie broke off her arrangement with Wirtz in 1950 and for the next three seasons produced her own tours under the name &quot;Sonja Henie Ice Revue&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>It was an ill-advised decision to set herself up in competition with Wirtz, whose shows now featured the new Olympic champion [[Barbara Ann Scott]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Since Wirtz controlled the best arenas and dates, Henie was left playing smaller venues and markets already saturated by other touring ice shows such as [[Ice Capades]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The collapse of a section of bleachers during a show in [[Baltimore, Maryland]] in 1952 compounded the tour's legal and financial woes</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1953 Henie formed a new partnership with [[Morris Chalfen]] to appear in his European ''[[Holiday On Ice]]'' tour</span>
				<span class='text'>This was a great success</span>

				<span class='text'>''The New York Times'', 12 January 1956</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; However, a subsequent South American tour in 1956 was a disaster</span>
				<span class='text'>Henie was drinking heavily at that time and could no longer keep up with the demands of touring, and this marked her retirement from skating</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1938, she published her autobiography ''Mitt livs eventyr'', which was translated and released as ''Wings on My Feet'' in 1940, which was republished in a revised edition in 1954</span>
				<span class='text'>At the time of her death, Henie was planning a comeback for a television special that would have aired in January 1970</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Henie in Berlin, 1930</span>
				<span class='text'>]Henie's connections with [[Adolf Hitler]] and other high-ranking [[Nazi]] officials made her the subject of controversy before, during, and after [[World War II]]</span>
				<span class='text'>During her amateur skating career, she performed often in [[Germany]] and was a favorite of German audiences and of Hitler personally</span>
				<span class='text'>As a wealthy celebrity, she moved in the same social circles as royalty and heads of state and made Hitler's acquaintance as a matter of course</span>
				<span class='text'>ontroversy appeared first when Henie greeted Hitler with a [[Nazi salute]] during an exhibition in [[Berlin]] some time before the [[1936 Winter Olympics]]; she was strongly denounced by the Norwegian press</span>
				<span class='text'>She did not repeat the salute at the Olympics in [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]], but after the Games she accepted an invitation to lunch with Hitler at his resort home in nearby [[Berchtesgaden]], where Hitler presented Henie with an autographed photo with a lengthy inscription</span>
				<span class='text'>After beginning her film career, Henie kept up her Nazi connections, for example personally arranging with [[Joseph Goebbels]] for the release of her first film, ''One in a Million'', in Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>uring the [[occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany]], German troops saw Hitler's autographed photo prominently displayed at the piano in the Henie family home in [[Landøya]], [[Asker]]</span>
