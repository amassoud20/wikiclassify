				<span class='text'>=Life==The oldest available sources disagree as to where Sun Tzu was born</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]'' states that Sun Tzu was born in [[Qi (state)|Qi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sawyer|2007|p=151}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; while [[Sima Qian]]'s later ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' states that Sun Tzu was a native of [[Wu (state)|Wu]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sawyer|2007|p=153}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Both sources agree that Sun Tzu was born in the late [[Spring and Autumn Period]] and that he was active as a general and strategist, serving [[kings of Wu|king]] [[King Helü|Helü]] of [[Wu (state)|Wu]] in the late sixth century BC, beginning around 512 BC</span>
				<span class='text'>Sun Tzu's victories then inspired him to write ''The Art of War''</span>
				<span class='text'>''The Art of War'' was one of the most widely read military treatises in the subsequent [[Warring States period]], a time of constant war among seven nations {{ndash}} [[Zhao (state)|Zhao]], Qi, [[Qin (state)|Qin]], [[Chu (state)|Chu]], [[Han (state)|Han]], [[Wei (state)|Wei]], and [[Yan (state)|Yan]] {{ndash}} who fought to control the vast expanse of fertile territory in Eastern China</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=mcneilly3&gt;{{harvnb|McNeilly|2001|pp=3–4}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;One of the more well-known stories about Sun Tzu, taken from Sima Qian, illustrates Sun Tzu's temperament as follows: Before hiring Sun Tzu, the King of Wu tested Sun Tzu's skills by commanding him to train a [[harem]] of 180 concubines into soldiers</span>
				<span class='text'>Sun Tzu divided them into two companies, appointing the two concubines most favored by the king as the company commanders</span>
				<span class='text'>When Sun Tzu first ordered the concubines to face right, they giggled</span>
				<span class='text'>In response, Sun Tzu said that the general, in this case himself, was responsible for ensuring that soldiers understood the commands given to them</span>
				<span class='text'>Then, he reiterated the command, and again the concubines giggled</span>
				<span class='text'>Sun Tzu then ordered the execution of the king's two favored concubines, to the king's protests</span>
				<span class='text'>He explained that if the general's soldiers understood their commands but did not obey, it was the fault of the officers</span>
				<span class='text'>Sun Tzu also said that, once a general was appointed, it was his duty to carry out his mission, even if the king protested</span>
				<span class='text'>After both concubines were killed, new officers were chosen to replace them</span>
				<span class='text'>Afterwards, both companies, now well aware of the costs of further frivolity, performed their maneuvers flawlessly</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=bradford134&gt;{{harvnb|Bradford|2000|pp=134–135}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Sima Qian claimed that Sun Tzu later proved on the battlefield that his theories were effective (for example, at the [[Battle of Boju]]), that he had a successful military career, and that he wrote ''The Art of War'' based on his tested expertise</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=bradford134/&gt; However, the ''[[Zuozhuan]]'', a historical text written centuries earlier than the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'', provides a much more detailed account of the Battle of Boju, but does not mention Sun Tzu at all</span>

				<span class='text'>It presents a [[philosophy of war]] for managing conflicts and winning battles</span>
				<span class='text'>It is accepted as a [[masterpiece]] on strategy and has been frequently cited and referred to by generals and theorists since it was first published, translated, and distributed internationally</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;McNeilly1&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|McNeilly|2001|p=5}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;There are numerous theories concerning when the text was completed and concerning the identity of the author or authors, but archeological recoveries show ''The Art of War'' had taken roughly its current form by at least the early [[Han dynasty|Han]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sawyer|2007|p=423}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Because it is impossible to prove definitively when the ''Art of War'' was completed before this date, the differing theories concerning the work's author or authors and date of completion are unlikely to be completely resolved</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sawyer|2007|p=150}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Some modern scholars believe that it contains not only the thoughts of its original author but also commentary and clarifications from later military theorists, such as [[Li Quan (general)|Li Quan]] and [[Du Mu]]</span>
				<span class='text'>f the military texts written before the [[Qin's wars of unification|unification of China]] and [[Shi Huangdi]]'s subsequent [[Burning of books and burying of scholars|book burning]] in the second century BC, six major works have survived</span>
				<span class='text'>During the much later [[Song dynasty]], these six works were combined with a [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] text into a collection called the ''[[Seven Military Classics]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>As a central part of that compilation, ''The Art of War'' formed the foundations of orthodox military theory in early modern China</span>
				<span class='text'>Illustrating this point, the book was required reading to pass the tests for imperial appointment to military positions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sawyer|1994|pp=13–14}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Sun Tzu's ''Art of War'' uses language that may be unusual in a Western text on warfare and strategy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Simpkins|Simpkins|1999|pp=131–33}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; For example, the eleventh chapter states that a leader must be &quot;serene and inscrutable&quot; and capable of comprehending &quot;unfathomable plans&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The text contains many similar remarks that have long confused Western readers lacking an awareness of the [[East Asian religions|East Asian context]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The meanings of such statements are clearer when interpreted in the context of [[Taoism|Taoist]] thought and practice</span>
				<span class='text'>Sun Tzu viewed the ideal general as an [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightened]] Taoist master, which has led to ''The Art of War'' being considered a prime example of Taoist strategy</span>
				<span class='text'>he book has also become popular among political leaders and those in [[business management]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite its title, ''The Art of War'' addresses strategy in a broad fashion, touching upon [[public administration]] and planning</span>
				<span class='text'>The text outlines theories of battle, but also advocates [[diplomacy]] and the cultivation of relationships with other nations as essential to the health of a state</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sawyer|2005|pp=34–35}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Traditionalists attribute the authorship of ''The Art of War'' to the historical figure Sun Wu who is chronicled in the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' and the ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; According to Ralph Sawyer, it is very likely Sun Tzu did exist and not only served as a general but also wrote the core of the book that bears his name</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;sawyer&quot;/&gt;Skeptics who identify issues with the traditionalist view point to possible anachronisms in ''The Art of War'' including terms, technology, philosophical ideas, events, and military techniques that should not have been available to Sun Wu</span>
				<span class='text'>They argue that there is a disparity between the large-scale wars and sophisticated techniques detailed in the text and the more primitive small-scale battles that many believe predominated in 6th-century-BC China</span>
				<span class='text'>Against this, Sawyer argues that the teachings of Sun Wu were probably taught to succeeding generations in his family or a small school of disciples, which eventually included Sun Bin</span>

				<span class='text'>Modern Chinese scholars explicitly rely on historical strategic lessons and ''The Art of War'' in developing their theories, seeing a direct relationship between their modern struggles and those of China in Sun Tzu's time</span>
