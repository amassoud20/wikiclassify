				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; After a year of studying [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], and [[Sanskrit]], and taking a variety of courses at the [[University of Geneva]], he commenced graduate work at the [[University of Leipzig]] in 1876</span>
				<span class='text'>wo years later at 21, Saussure published a book entitled ''M√©moire sur le syst√®me primitif des voyelles dans les langues indo-europ√©ennes'' (Dissertation on the Primitive Vowel System in Indo-European Languages)</span>
				<span class='text'>After this he studied for a year at [[Berlin]] under the 'Privatdozenten' Heinrich Zimmer, with whom he studied Celtic, and [[Hermann Oldenberg]], with whom he continued his studies of Sanskrit</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Joseph (2012:253)&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Leipzig to defend his doctoral dissertation ''De l'emploi du g√©nitif absolu en Sanscrit'', and was awarded his doctorate in February 1880</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon afterwards, he relocated to [[Paris]], where he lectured on Sanskrit, Gothic and Old High German, and occasionally other subjects</span>
				<span class='text'>e taught at the [[√âcole pratique des hautes √©tudes]] for eleven years, during which he was named Chevalier de la L√©gion d'Honneur (Knight of the [[Legion of Honor]])</span>

				<span class='text'>Saussure lectured on Sanskrit and Indo-European at the [[University of Geneva]] for the remainder of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>It was not until 1907 that Saussure began teaching the Course of General Linguistics, which he would offer three times, ending in the summer of 1911</span>
				<span class='text'>He died in 1913 in [[Vufflens-le-Ch√¢teau]], Vaud, Switzerland</span>
				<span class='text'>His brother was the Esperantist [[Ren√© de Saussure]] and his son was the psychoanalyst [[Raymond de Saussure]]</span>
				<span class='text'>aussure attempted at various times in the 1880s and 1890s to write a book on general linguistic matters</span>
				<span class='text'>His lectures about important principles of language description in Geneva between 1907 and 1911 were collected and published by his pupils posthumously in the famous ''[[Cours de linguistique g√©n√©rale]]'' in 1916</span>
				<span class='text'>Some of his manuscripts, including an unfinished essay discovered in 1996, were published in ''Writings in General Linguistics'', though most of the material in this book had already been published in Engler's critical edition of the ''Course'' in 1967 and 1974</span>
				<span class='text'>(TUFA)==Legacy==Saussure's theoretical reconstructions of the [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] vocalic system, and particularly his [[Laryngeal theory|theory of laryngeals]] otherwise unattested at the time, bore fruit and found confirmation after the decipherment of [[Hittite language|Hittite]] in the work of later generations of linguists like [[Emile Benveniste]] and Walter Couvreur, who both drew  direct inspiration from their reading of the 1878 ''M√©moire''</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Saussure also had a major impact on the development of linguistic theory in the first half of the 20th century</span>
				<span class='text'>His two currents of thought emerged independently of each other, one in Europe, the other in America</span>
				<span class='text'>The results of each incorporated the basic notions of Saussure's thought in forming the central tenets of [[Structuralism|structural linguistics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His status in contemporary theoretical linguistics is much diminished, with many key positions now dated or subject to challenge, though post-structuralist 21-century reception remains more open to Saussure's influence</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Boris Gasparov</span>
				<span class='text'>''Beyond Pure Reason'', pp1-8, 2010</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Saussure posited that linguistic form is arbitrary, and therefore that all languages function in a similar fashion</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Saussure, a language is arbitrary because there is no objective relationship between the sign (e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>the letters that make up the word &quot;cat&quot;) and the thing it refers to (the actual cat)</span>
				<span class='text'> Meaning emerges from the word &quot;cat&quot; not because of any objective link between these letters and the animal they are indicating; rather, meaning emerges from the word &quot;cat&quot; by comparing and contrasting it to other words, such as &quot;car&quot; and &quot;mat</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;  This is what Saussure means by the argument that language is self-referential</span>
				<span class='text'>n Europe, the most important work in this period of influence was done by the [[Prague school]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Most notably, [[Nikolay Trubetzkoy]] and [[Roman Jakobson]] headed the efforts of the Prague School in setting the course of [[Phonology|phonological theory]] in the decades following 1940</span>
				<span class='text'>Jakobson's universalizing structural-functional theory of phonology, based on a [[markedness]] hierarchy of [[distinctive features]], was the first successful solution of a plane of linguistic analysis according to the Saussurean hypotheses</span>
				<span class='text'>Elsewhere, [[Louis Hjelmslev]] and the [[The Copenhagen school (linguistics)|Copenhagen School]] proposed new interpretations of linguistics from structuralist theoretical frameworks</span>
				<span class='text'>n America, Saussure's ideas informed the distributionalism of [[Leonard Bloomfield]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = John Earl Joseph| title = From Whitney to Chomsky: Essays in the History OfAmerican Linguisitcs| url = https://books</span>

				<span class='text'>Trager]], Rulon S</span>
				<span class='text'>Wells III, [[Charles Hockett]], and through [[Zellig Harris]] the young [[Noam Chomsky]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition to Chomsky's theory of [[Transformational grammar]], other contemporary developments of structuralism included [[Kenneth Pike]]'s theory of [[tagmemics]], [[Sidney Lamb]]'s theory of [[stratificational grammar]], and [[Michael Silverstein]]'s work</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Systemic functional linguistics]] is a theory considered to be based firmly on the Saussurean principles of the sign, albeit with some modifications</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Ruqaiya Hasan]] describes [[systemic functional linguistics]] as a 'post-Saussurean' linguistic theory</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; [[Michael Halliday]] argues that:{{quote|Saussure took the sign as the organizing concept for linguistic structure, using it to express the conventional nature of language in the phrase &quot;l'arbitraire du signe&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>This has the effect of highlighting what is, in fact, the one point of arbitrariness in the system, namely the phonological shape of words, and hence allows the non-arbitrariness of the rest to emerge with greater clarity</span>
				<span class='text'>An example of something that is distinctly non-arbitrary is the way different kinds of meaning in language are expressed by different kinds of grammatical structure, as appears when linguistic structure is interpreted in functional terms &lt;ref&gt;Halliday, MAK</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;}}===''Course in General Linguistics''==={{Main|Course in General Linguistics}}Saussure's most influential work, ''Course in General Linguistics'' (''Cours de linguistique g√©n√©rale''), was published posthumously in 1916 by former students [[Charles Bally]] and [[Albert Sechehaye]] on the basis of notes taken from Saussure's lectures in Geneva</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''Course'' became one of the [[wikt:seminal|seminal]] linguistics works of the 20th century, not primarily for the content (many of the ideas had been anticipated in the works of other 20th century linguists), but rather for the innovative approach that Saussure applied in discussing linguistic phenomena</span>
				<span class='text'>ts central notion is that language may be analyzed as a [[formal system]] of differential elements, apart from the messy dialectics of real-time production and comprehension</span>
				<span class='text'>Examples of these elements include his notion of the [[Sign (linguistics)|linguistic sign]], which is composed of the signifier and the signified</span>
				<span class='text'>Though the sign may also have a referent, Saussure took this last question to lie beyond the linguist's purview</span>
				<span class='text'>hrough this book, he stated that a linguist can develop a synchronic analysis of a text or theory of language however, they must learn just as much or more about the language/text as it exists at any moment in time</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Language is a system of signs that expresses ideas&quot; A science that studies the life of signs within society and is a part of social and general psychology</span>
				<span class='text'>Saussure believed that semiotics is concerned with everything that can be taken as a sign, he called it semiology</span>
				<span class='text'>==Laryngeal theory===While a student, Saussure published an important work in [[Indo-European studies|Indo-European]] [[philology]] that proposed the existence of ghosts in [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] called ''sonant coefficients''</span>
				<span class='text'>The Scandinavian scholar [[Hermann M√∂ller]] suggested that these might actually be laryngeal consonants, leading to what is now known as the [[laryngeal theory]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It has been argued that the problem Saussure encountered of trying to explain how he was able to make systematic and predictive hypotheses from known linguistic data to unknown linguistic data stimulated his development of [[structuralism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Saussure's predictions about the existence of primate coefficients/laryngeals and their evolution proved a resounding success when the [[Hittite texts]] were discovered and deciphered, some 50 years later</span>
				<span class='text'>==Later critics===The closing sentence of Saussure's ''Course in General Linguistics'' has been challenged in many academic disciplines and subdisciplines with its contention that, &quot;linguistics has as its unique and true object the language envisioned in itself and for itself</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Boris Gasparov</span>
				<span class='text'>''Beyond Pure Reason'', pp59-60, 2010</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; By the latter half of the 20th century, many of Saussure's ideas were under heavy criticism</span>
				<span class='text'>aussure's linguistic ideas are still considered important for their time, but have suffered considerably subsequently under rhetorical developments aimed at showing how linguistics had changed or was changing with the times</span>
				<span class='text'>As a consequence, Saussure's ideas are now often presented by professional linguists as outdated and as superseded by developments such as [[cognitive linguistics]] and [[generative grammar]], or have been so modified in their basic tenets as to make their use in their original formulations difficult without risking distortion, as in [[systemic linguistics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This development is occasionally overstated, however; for example [[Jan Koster]] states, &quot;Saussure, considered the most important linguist of the century in Europe until the 1950s, hardly plays a role in current theoretical thinking about language,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Koster, Jan</span>

				<span class='text'>115‚Äì120</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; More accurate would be to say that Saussure's contributions have been absorbed into how language is approached at such a fundamental level as to be, for many intents and purposes, invisible, much like the contributions of the [[Neogrammarian]]s in the 19th century</span>
				<span class='text'>Over-reactions can also be seen in comments of the cognitive linguist Mark Turner&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Mark</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; who reports that many of Saussure's concepts were &quot;wrong on a grand scale&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Here it is necessary to be rather more finely nuanced in the positions attributed to Saussure and in their longterm influence on the development of linguistic theorizing in all schools; for a more up-to-date re-reading of Saussure with respect to these issues, see Paul Thibault</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Just as many principles of structural linguistics are still pursued, modified and adapted in current practice and according to what has been learnt since about the embodied functioning of brain and the role of language within this, so basic tenets begun with Saussure still can be found operating behind the scenes today</span>
				<span class='text'>==Semiology===Saussure is one of the founding fathers of [[semiotics]], which he called semiology</span>
				<span class='text'>His concept of the sign/signifier/signified/referent forms the core of the field</span>
				<span class='text'>Equally crucial, although often overlooked or misapplied, is the dimension of the syntagmatic and paradigmatic axes of linguistic description</span>
				<span class='text'>nstead of focusing his theory on the origins of language and its historical aspects, Saussure concentrated on the patterns and functions of language instead</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the name has been changed to semiotics, Saussure's theory is still commonly used in today's society</span>
				<span class='text'>He also believed that the relationship that exists between the signifier and the signified is purely arbitrary and analytical</span>
				<span class='text'>ome linguists have pointed out to the fact that Saussure did not 'invent' semiotics, but rather built upon Aristotelian and neoplatonist knowledge from the Middle Ages, particularly in regard to the writings of [[Augustine of Hippo]]: &quot;as for the constitution of Saussurian semiotic theory, the importance of the Augustinian thought contribution (correlated to the Stoic one) has also been recognized</span>
				<span class='text'>Saussure did not do anything but reform an ancient theory in Europe, according to the modern conceptual exigencies&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Such scholars took influence from Saussure's ideas in their own areas of study (literary studies/philosophy, psychoanalysis, anthropology, respectively)</span>
