				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Weigel, Antoninus Pius&quot;/&gt;By this scheme, Verus, who was already Hadrian's adoptive grandson through his natural father, remained Hadrian's adoptive son through his new father</span>
				<span class='text'> The adoption of Marcus Aurelius was probably a suggestion of Antoninus himself, since the former was the nephew of the latter's wife and would be his favorite son</span>

				<span class='text'>151&quot;&gt;Bowman, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>151&lt;/ref&gt; his efforts to persuade the Senate to grant these honours is the most likely reason given for his title of ''Pius'' (dutiful in affection; compare ''[[pietas]]'')</span>

				<span class='text'>55; Canduci, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>39&lt;/ref&gt;  Two other reasons for this title are that he would support his aged father-in-law with his hand at Senate meetings, and that he had saved those men that Hadrian, during his period of ill-health, had condemned to death</span>

				<span class='text'>523&lt;/ref&gt;Immediately after Hadrian's death, Antoninus approached Marcus and requested that his marriage arrangements be amended: Marcus' betrothal to Ceionia Fabia would be annulled, and he would be betrothed to Faustina, Antoninus' daughter, instead</span>

				<span class='text'>525&lt;/ref&gt;  It was however in Britain that Antoninus decided to follow a new, more aggressive path, with the appointment of a new governor in 139, [[Quintus Lollius Urbicus]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowman, pg</span>

				<span class='text'>152&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Firth of Forth]] to the [[Firth of Clyde]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The wall, however, was soon gradually decommissioned during the mid-150s and eventually abandoned late during the reign (early 160s), for reasons that are still not quite clear</span>

				<span class='text'>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] makes a brief and confused mention of a war in Britain</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Antonine's Wall was, in principle, much shorter and outwardly more defensible than Hadrian's Wall, the area included by it into the empire was barren, therefore straining supply lines and not worthy holding to on a cost benefit analysis</span>

				<span class='text'>Barnsley: Pen &amp; Sword, 2015, ISBN 978-1-84884-377-6, page  75&lt;/ref&gt; It has been therefore speculated that the invasion of Lowland Scotland and the building of the wall had to do mostly with internal politics, that is, offering Antoninus an opportunity to gain some modicum of necessary military prestige at the start of his reign</span>
				<span class='text'>Actually, the campaign in Britannia was followed by an Imperial salutation - that is, by Antoninus formally taking for the second (and last) time the title of [[Imperator]] -  in 142</span>

				<span class='text'>London: Bloomsbury, 2013, ISBN 978-1-8539-9698-6, page 53&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that around the same time coins were struck announcing a victory in Britain points to Antoninus' need to publicize his achievements</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Salway, 149&lt;/ref&gt;That this quest for some military achievement responded to an actual need, is proved by the fact that, although generally peaceful, Antoninus' reign was not free from attempts of usurpation: [[Historia Augusta]] mentions two, made by senators Cornelius Priscianus (by the way, Lollius Urbicus' successor as governor of Britain) and Atilius Rufius Titianus - both confirmed by the [[Fasti Ostienses]] as well as by the erasing of Priscianus' name on an inscription &lt;ref&gt;Albino Garzetti, ''From Tiberius to the Antonines: A History of the Roman Empire AD 14-192''</span>

				<span class='text'>Edicions Universitat Barcelona, 2005, ISBN 84-475-3017-5 , page 301&lt;/ref&gt;There were also some troubles in [[Dacia Inferior]] which required the granting of additional powers to the [[Procurator (Roman)|procurator]] governor and the dispatchment of additional soldiers to the province</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Birley, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>113&lt;/ref&gt;Nevertheless, Antoninus was virtually unique among emperors in that he dealt with these crises without leaving Italy once during his reign,&lt;ref&gt;Speidel, Michael P</span>

				<span class='text'>50; Canduci, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>40&lt;/ref&gt; but instead dealt with provincial matters of war and peace through their governors or through imperial letters to the cities such as Ephesus (of which some were publicly displayed)</span>
				<span class='text'>This style of government was highly praised by his contemporaries and by later generations</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See Victor, 15:3&lt;/ref&gt;===Economy and Administration===Antoninus was regarded as a skilled administrator and as a builder</span>
				<span class='text'>In spite of an extensive building directive - the free access of the people of Rome to drinking water was expanded with the construction of aqueducts, not only in Rome but throughout the Empire, as well as bridges and roads -, the Emperor still managed to leave behind a sizable public treasure, of around two and a half million sesterzi</span>
				<span class='text'>he Emperor also famously suspended the collection of taxes from cities affected by natural disasters, such as when fires struck Rome and Narbona, and earthquakes affected [[Rhodes]] and the [[Province of Asia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He offered hefty financial grants for rebuilding and recovery of various Greek cities after two serious earthquakes: the first, ''circa'' 140, which affected mostly Rhodes and other islands; the second, in 152, which hit [[Cyzicus]] - where the huge and newly built Temple to Hadrian was destroyed&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Burrell</span>

				<span class='text'>==Legal reforms===Antoninus tried to portray himself as a magistrate of the ''res publica'', no matter how extended and ill-defined his competences were: therefore the fact that he is credited with the splitting of the imperial treasure, the [[Fiscus]], into the fiscus itself-or ''patrimonium'', the properties of the &quot;Crown&quot;, the hereditary properties of each succeeding person that sat on the throne - and the ''res privata'', the &quot;private&quot; properties tied to the personal maintenance of the Emperor</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''res privata'' lands could be sold and/or given away, while the ''patrimonium'' properties were regarded as public</span>

				<span class='text'>However, Antoninus did take a great interest in the revision and practice of the law throughout the empire</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bury, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>526&quot;&gt;Bury, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>526&lt;/ref&gt; One of his chief concerns was to having local communities conforming their legal procedures to existing Roman norms: in a case concerning repression of banditry by local police officers (&quot;irenarchs&quot;) in Asia Minor, Antoninus ordered that these officers should not treat suspects as already condemned, and also keep a detailed copy of their interrogations,to be used in the possibility of an appeal to the Roman governor</span>

				<span class='text'>Edinburgh University Press, 2012,ISBN 978-0-7486-2050-0,page 91&lt;/ref&gt; Also, although Antoninus was not an innovator, he would not always follow the absolute letter of the law; rather he was driven by concerns over humanity and equality, and introduced into [[Roman law]] many important new principles based upon this notion</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bury, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>526&quot;&gt;Bury, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>526&lt;/ref&gt;In this, the emperor was assisted by five chief lawyers: L</span>
				<span class='text'>Fulvius Aburnius Valens, an author of legal treatises; L</span>
				<span class='text'>Volusius Maecianus, chosen to conduct the legal studies of Marcus Aurelius, and author of a large work on Fidei Commissa (Testamentary Trusts); L</span>

				<span class='text'>526&quot;&gt;Bury, pg</span>

				<span class='text'>526&quot;&gt;Bury, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>526&lt;/ref&gt;Antoninus passed measures to facilitate the [[enfranchisement]] of [[slavery|slaves]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bury, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>527&quot;&gt;Bury, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>527&lt;/ref&gt; Mostly, he favoured the principle of ''favor libertatis'', giving the putative freedman the benefit of the doubt when the claim to freedom was not clearcut</span>

				<span class='text'>Franche-Comté, 2007 ISBN 978-2-84867-169-7 , page 159&lt;/ref&gt;   In criminal law, Antoninus introduced the important principle that accused persons are [[Presumption of innocence|not to be treated as guilty before trial]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bury, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>527&quot;&gt;Bury, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>527&lt;/ref&gt;  He also asserted the principle that the trial was to be held, and the punishment inflicted, in the place where the crime had been committed</span>
				<span class='text'>He mitigated the use of [[torture]] in examining slaves by certain limitations</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus he prohibited the application of torture to children under fourteen years, though this rule had exceptions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bury, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>527&quot;&gt;Bury, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>527&lt;/ref&gt; However, it must be stressed that Antoninus ''extended'', by means of a [[rescript]], the use of torture as a means of obtaining evidence to pecuniary cases, when it had been applied up until then only in criminal cases</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[Digest (Roman law)|Digest]] , 48</span>

				<span class='text'>, as quoted by Edward Peters, ''Torture'', Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1996, ISBN 0-8122-1599-0 , page  29&lt;/ref&gt; Also, already at the time torture of free men of low status (''humiliores'') had become legal, as proved by the fact that Antoninus exempted town councillors expressly from it, and also free men of high rank (''honestiores'') in general</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Grant, 154/155</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;One highlight during his reign occurred in 148, with the nine-hundredth anniversary of the foundation of [[Rome]] being celebrated by the hosting of magnificent games in Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bowman, pg, 154&lt;/ref&gt;  It lasted a number of days, and a host of exotic animals were killed, including elephants, giraffes, tigers, rhinoceroses, crocodiles and hippopotami</span>
				<span class='text'>While this increased Antoninus’s popularity, the frugal emperor had to debase the [[Roman currency]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He decreased the silver purity of the denarius from 89% to 83</span>

				<span class='text'>According to the [[Talmud]] (Avodah Zarah 10a-b), Rabbi Judah was very wealthy and greatly revered in Rome</span>

				<span class='text'>==Death===In 156, Antoninus Pius turned 70</span>
				<span class='text'>He found it difficult to keep himself upright without [[corset|stays]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He started nibbling on dry bread to give him the strength to stay awake through his morning receptions</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 114&lt;/ref&gt;Two days before his death, the biographer reports, Antoninus was at his ancestral estate at [[Lorium]], in [[Etruria]],&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, pg</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|250px|Arch of Antoninus Pius in [[Sbeïtla]], [[Tunisia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>]The only account of his life handed down to us is that of the ''[[Augustan History]]'', an unreliable and mostly fabricated work</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, it still contains information that is considered reasonably sound – for instance, it is the only source that mentions the erection of the Antonine Wall in Britain</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Life of Antoninus Pius'' 5:4&lt;/ref&gt;  Antoninus is unique among Roman emperors in that he has no other biographies</span>
				<span class='text'>Historians have therefore turned to public records for what details we know</span>
				<span class='text'>==In later scholarship===Antoninus in many ways was the ideal of the landed gentleman praised not only by ancient Romans, but also by later scholars of classical history, such as [[Edward Gibbon]] or the author of the article on Antoninus Pius in the ninth edition of the [[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica|Encyclopædia Britannica]]:{{quote|A few months afterwards, on Hadrian's death, he was enthusiastically welcomed to the throne by the Roman people, who, for once, were not disappointed in their anticipation of a happy reign</span>
				<span class='text'>For Antoninus came to his new office with simple tastes, kindly disposition, extensive experience, a well-trained intelligence and the sincerest desire for the welfare of his subjects</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead of plundering to support his prodigality, he emptied his private treasury to assist distressed provinces and cities, and everywhere exercised rigid economy (hence the nickname κυμινοπριστης &quot;cummin-splitter&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead of exaggerating into treason whatever was susceptible of unfavorable interpretation, he turned the very conspiracies that were formed against him into opportunities for demonstrating his clemency</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead of stirring up persecution against the Christians, he extended to them the strong hand of his protection throughout the empire</span>
				<span class='text'>Rather than give occasion to that oppression which he regarded as inseparable from an emperor's progress through his dominions, he was content to spend all the years of his reign in Rome, or its neighbourhood</span>
				<span class='text'>}Later historians had a more nuanced view of his reign</span>
				<span class='text'>According to the historian [[J</span>
				<span class='text'>B</span>
				<span class='text'>Bury]], {{quote|however estimable the man, Antoninus was hardly a great statesman</span>
				<span class='text'>The rest which the Empire enjoyed under his auspices had been rendered possible through Hadrian’s activity, and was not due to his own exertions; on the other hand, he carried the policy of peace at any price too far, and so entailed calamities on the state after his death</span>
				<span class='text'>He not only had no originality or power of initiative, but he had not even the insight or boldness to work further on the new lines marked out by Hadrian</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bury, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>524&lt;/ref&gt;}}Inevitably, the surviving evidence is not complete enough to determine whether one should interpret, with older scholars, that he wisely curtailed the activities of the Roman Empire to a careful minimum, or perhaps that he was uninterested in events away from Rome and [[Italy]] and his inaction contributed to the pressing troubles that faced not only Marcus Aurelius but also the emperors of the third century</span>
				<span class='text'> German historian [[Ernst Kornemann]] has had it in his ''Römische Geschichte'' [2 vols</span>
				<span class='text'> ed</span>
				<span class='text'>by H</span>
				<span class='text'>Bengtson, Stuttgart 1954] that the reign of Antoninus comprised &quot;a succession of grossly wasted opportunities,&quot; given the upheavals that were to come</span>
				<span class='text'>There is more to this argument, given that the Parthians in the East were themselves soon to make no small amount of mischief after Antoninus' passing</span>
				<span class='text'> Kornemann's brief is that Antoninus might have waged preventive wars to head off these outsiders</span>
				<span class='text'>=Descendants==Although only one of his four children survived to adulthood, Antoninus came to be ancestor to generations of prominent Roman statesmen and socialites, including at least one empress consort and as the maternal grandfather of the Emperor [[Commodus]]</span>
				<span class='text'> The family of Antoninus Pius and [[Faustina the Elder]] also represents one of the few periods in ancient Roman history where the position of Emperor passed smoothly from father to son</span>
