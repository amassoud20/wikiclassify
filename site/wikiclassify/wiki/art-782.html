				<span class='text'>Gehry's work has remained largely unaligned with broader stylistic tendencies or movements</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=September 2015}} With his earliest educational influences rooted in [[modernism]], Gehry's work has sought to escape modernist stylistic tropes while still remaining interested in some of its underlying transformative agendas</span>
				<span class='text'>Continually working between given circumstances and unanticipated materializations, Gehry's style works to disrupt expectations</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=September 2015}}Gehry is sometimes associated with what is known as the &quot;Los Angeles School&quot; or the &quot;Santa Monica School&quot; of architecture</span>
				<span class='text'>The appropriateness of this designation and the existence of such a school, however, remains controversial due to the lack of a unifying philosophy or theory</span>
				<span class='text'>This designation stems from the Los Angeles area's producing a group of the most influential postmodern architects, including such notable Gehry contemporaries as [[Eric Owen Moss]] and Pritzker Prize-winner [[Thom Mayne]] of Morphosis, as well as the famous schools of architecture at the [[Southern California Institute of Architecture]] (co‑founded by Mayne), [[UCLA]], and [[University of Southern California|USC]] where Gehry is a member of the board of directors</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=September 2015}}Gehry's style at times seems unfinished or even crude, but his work is consistent with the California &quot;[[Funk art|funk]]&quot; art movement in the 1960s and early 1970s, which featured the use of inexpensive found objects and non-traditional media such as clay to make serious art</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In the first 12 months after the museum was opened, an estimated $160&amp;nbsp;million were added to the Basque economy</span>
				<span class='text'>In subsequent years there have been many attempts to replicate this effect through large-scale eye-catching architectural commissions that have been both successful and unsuccessful, such as [[Daniel Libeskind]]'s expansion of the [[Denver Art Museum]] and buildings by Gehry himself such as the almost universally well-received [[Walt Disney Concert Hall]] in Los Angeles and the more controversial [[EMP Museum]] in [[Seattle]]</span>

				<span class='text'>They employed wire armatures molded into fish shapes, onto which shards of plastic laminate ColorCore are individually glued</span>
				<span class='text'>Since the creation of the first lamp in 1984, the fish has become a recurrent motif in Gehry's work, most notably in the ''Fish Sculpture'' at [[La Vila Olímpica del Poblenou]] in Barcelona (1989–92) and ''Standing Glass Fish'' for the [[Minneapolis Sculpture Garden]] (1986)</span>
