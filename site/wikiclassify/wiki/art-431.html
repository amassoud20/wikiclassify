				<span class='text'>Their newspapers and other publications were closed</span>
				<span class='text'>Such measures had effectively ended any legitimate political role of the socialist movement in Cambodia</span>
				<span class='text'>In July 1962, the underground communist party secretary Tou Samouth was arrested and later killed while in custody, allowing Sar to become the acting leader</span>
				<span class='text'>At a 1963 party meeting, attended by at most 18 people, Sar was elected secretary of the party's central committee</span>
				<span class='text'>That March, Saloth went into hiding after his name was published in a list of leftist suspects put together by the police for [[Norodom Sihanouk]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He fled to the Vietnamese border region and made contact with Vietnamese units fighting against [[South Vietnam]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n early 1964, Sar convinced the Vietnamese to help the Cambodian socialists set up their own base camp</span>
				<span class='text'>The party's central committee met later that year and issued a declaration calling for armed struggle, emphasizing &quot;self-reliance&quot; in accordance with extreme Cambodians</span>
				<span class='text'>In the border camps, the ideology of the Khmer Rouge was gradually developed</span>
				<span class='text'>The party, breaking with [[Marxism]], declared that rural peasant farmers were the true working class proletarian and lifeblood of the revolution, the central committee members having grown up in a [[feudalism|feudal]] peasant society</span>
				<span class='text'>fter another wave of repression by Sihanouk in 1965, the Khmer Rouge movement under Saloth grew at a rapid rate</span>
				<span class='text'>Many teachers and students left the cities for the countryside to join the movement</span>
				<span class='text'>n April 1965, Sar went to North Vietnam to gain approval for an uprising in Cambodia against the government</span>
				<span class='text'>[[North Vietnam]] refused to support any uprising due to ongoing negotiation with the Cambodian government</span>
				<span class='text'>Sihanouk promised to allow the Vietnamese to use Cambodian territory and Cambodian ports in their war against South Vietnam</span>
				<span class='text'>fter returning to Cambodia in 1966, Sar organized a party meeting where a number of important decisions were made</span>
				<span class='text'>The party was officially, but secretly, renamed the [[Communist Party of Kampuchea]] (CPK)</span>
				<span class='text'>Lower ranks of the party were not informed of the decision</span>
				<span class='text'>It was also decided to establish command zones and prepare each region for an uprising against the government</span>
				<span class='text'>n early 1966, fighting broke out in the countryside between peasants and the government over the price paid for rice</span>
				<span class='text'>Sar's Khmer Rouge was caught by surprise by the uprisings and could not take any real advantage of them</span>
				<span class='text'>But the government's refusal to find a peaceful solution to the problem created rural unrest that played into the hands of the socialist movement</span>
				<span class='text'>t was not until early 1967 that Sar decided to launch a national uprising, even though North Vietnam refused to assist in any meaningful way</span>
				<span class='text'>The uprising was launched on 18 January 1968, with a raid on an army base south of [[Battambang]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Battambang area had already seen two years of great peasant unrest</span>
				<span class='text'>The attack was driven off by the army, but the Khmer Rouge had captured a number of weapons, which were then used to drive police forces out of Cambodian villages</span>
				<span class='text'>y the summer of 1968, Sar began transitioning from a party leader working with a collective leadership, into the absolutist leader of the [[Khmer Rouge]] movement</span>
				<span class='text'>Where before he had shared communal quarters with other leaders, he now had his own compound with a personal staff and guards</span>
				<span class='text'>Outsiders were no longer allowed to approach him</span>
				<span class='text'>Rather, people were summoned into his presence by his staff</span>
				<span class='text'>=Leadership==The movement was estimated to consist of no more than 200 regular members, but the core of the movement was supported by a number of villages many times that size</span>
				<span class='text'>While weapons were in short supply, the insurgency still operated in twelve out of nineteen districts of Cambodia</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1969, Sar called a party conference and decided to change the party's propaganda strategy</span>
				<span class='text'>Before 1969, opposition to [[Norodom Sihanouk|Sihanouk]] was the main focus of its propaganda</span>
				<span class='text'>However, in 1969, the party decided to shift the focus of its propaganda in order to oppose the right-wing parties of Cambodia and their alleged pro-American attitudes</span>
				<span class='text'>While the party ceased making anti-Sihanouk statements in public, in private the party had not changed its view of him</span>
				<span class='text'>he road to power for Sar and the Khmer Rouge was opened by the events of January 1970, in Cambodia</span>
				<span class='text'>While he was out of the country,  Sihanouk ordered the government to stage anti-Vietnamese protests in the capital</span>
				<span class='text'>The protests quickly spilled out of control and the embassies of both North and South Vietnam were wrecked</span>
				<span class='text'>Sihanouk, who had ordered the protests, then denounced them from [[Paris]] and blamed unnamed individuals in Cambodia for inciting them</span>
				<span class='text'>These actions, along with clandestine operations by Sihanouk's followers in Cambodia, convinced the government that he should be removed as [[head of state]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The National Assembly voted to remove Sihanouk from office and closed Cambodia's ports to North Vietnamese weapons traffic, demanding that the North Vietnamese leave Cambodia</span>
				<span class='text'>he North Vietnamese reacted to the political changes in Cambodia by sending Premier [[Phạm Văn Đồng]] to meet Sihanouk in China and recruit him into an alliance with the Khmer Rouge</span>
				<span class='text'>Sar was also contacted by the North Vietnamese, who reversed their position, offering him whatever resources he wanted for his [[insurgency]] against the Cambodian government</span>
				<span class='text'>Sar and Sihanouk were actually in [[Beijing]] at the same time, but the Vietnamese and Chinese leaders never informed Sihanouk of the presence of Sar or allowed the two men to meet</span>
				<span class='text'>Shortly afterward, Sihanouk issued an appeal by radio to the people of Cambodia asking them to rise up against the government and to support the Khmer Rouge</span>
				<span class='text'>In May 1970, Sar finally returned to Cambodia and the insurgency gained traction</span>

				<span class='text'>df&lt;/ref&gt;Throughout 1971, the Vietnamese (North Vietnamese and Viet Cong) did most of the fighting against the Cambodian government while Sar and the Khmer Rouge functioned almost as auxiliaries to their forces</span>
				<span class='text'>Sar took advantage of the situation in order to gather in new recruits and to train them according to a higher standard than was previously possible</span>
				<span class='text'>Sar also put the resources of all Khmer Rouge organizations into political education and indoctrination</span>
				<span class='text'>While accepting anyone regardless of background into the Khmer Rouge army at this time, Sar greatly increased the requirements for membership in the party</span>
				<span class='text'>Students and so-called &quot;middle peasants&quot; were now rejected by the party</span>
				<span class='text'>Those with clear peasant backgrounds were the preferred recruits for party membership</span>
				<span class='text'>These restrictions were ironic in that most of the senior party leadership including Sar came from student and middle peasant backgrounds</span>
				<span class='text'>They also created an intellectual split between the educated old guard party members and the uneducated peasant new party members</span>
				<span class='text'>n early 1972, Sar toured the insurgent/North Vietnamese controlled areas in Cambodia</span>
				<span class='text'>He saw a regular Khmer Rouge army of 35,000 men taking shape supported by around 100,000 [[Irregular military|irregulars]]</span>
				<span class='text'>China was supplying five million dollars a year in weapons and Sar had organized an independent revenue source for the party in the form of [[rubber]] plantations in eastern Cambodia using forced labor</span>
				<span class='text'>fter a central committee meeting in May 1972, the party under the direction of Sar began to enforce new levels of discipline and conformity in areas under their control</span>
				<span class='text'>Minorities such as the [[Cham (Asia)|Chams]] were forced to conform to Cambodian styles of dress and appearance</span>
				<span class='text'>These policies, such as forbidding the Chams from wearing jewelry, were soon extended to the whole population</span>
				<span class='text'>A haphazard version of [[land reform]] was undertaken by Sar</span>
				<span class='text'>Its basis was that all land holdings should be of uniform size</span>
				<span class='text'>The party also confiscated all private means of transportation</span>
				<span class='text'>The 1972 policies were aimed at reducing the peoples of the liberated areas to a sort of feudal peasant equality</span>
				<span class='text'>These policies were generally favorable at the time to poor peasants and were extremely unfavorable to refugees from towns, who had fled to the countryside</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1972, the North Vietnamese army's forces began to withdraw from the fighting against the Cambodian government</span>
				<span class='text'>Sar issued a new set of decrees in May 1973 that started the process of reorganizing peasant villages into [[cooperative]]s where property was jointly owned and where individual possessions were banned</span>
				<span class='text'>==Control of the countryside===The Khmer Rouge advanced during 1973</span>
				<span class='text'>After they reached the outskirts of Phnom Penh, Sar issued orders during the peak of the [[Wet season|rainy season]] that the city be taken</span>
				<span class='text'>The orders led to futile attacks and wasted lives within the Khmer Rouge army</span>
				<span class='text'>By the middle of 1973, the Khmer Rouge under Sar controlled almost two-thirds of the country and half the population</span>
				<span class='text'>North Vietnam realized that it no longer controlled the situation and it began to treat Sar as more of an equal leader than as a junior partner</span>
				<span class='text'>n late 1973, Sar made strategic decisions that determined the future of the war</span>
				<span class='text'>First, he decided to cut the capital off from contact with outside sources of supplies, putting the city under siege</span>
				<span class='text'>Second, he enforced tight control over people trying to leave the city through Khmer Rouge lines</span>
				<span class='text'>He also ordered a series of general [[purge]]s of former government officials, and anyone with an education</span>
				<span class='text'>A set of new prisons was also constructed in Khmer Rouge run areas</span>
				<span class='text'>The Cham minority attempted an uprising in order to stop the destruction of their culture</span>
				<span class='text'>The uprising was quickly crushed: Sar ordered that harsh physical torture be used against most of those involved in the revolt</span>
				<span class='text'>As previously, Sar tested out harsh new policies against the Cham minority, before extending them to the general population of the country</span>
				<span class='text'>he Khmer Rouge also had a policy of evacuating urban areas and forcibly relocating their residents to the countryside</span>
				<span class='text'>When the Khmer Rouge took the town of [[Kratié (city)|Kratie]] in 1971, Sar and other members of the party were shocked at how fast the &quot;liberated&quot; urban areas shook off socialism and went back to the old ways</span>
				<span class='text'>Various ideas were tried in order to re-create the town in the image of the party, but nothing worked</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1973, out of total frustration, Sar decided that the only solution was to send the entire population of the town to the fields in the countryside</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote at the time &quot;if the result of so many sacrifices was that the capitalists remain in control, what was the point of the revolution?&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Shortly after, Sar ordered the evacuation of the {{formatnum:15000}} people of Kompong Cham for the same reasons</span>
				<span class='text'>The Khmer Rouge then moved on in 1974 to evacuate the larger city of [[Oudong]]</span>
				<span class='text'>nternationally, Sar and the Khmer Rouge gained the recognition of 63 countries as the true government of Cambodia</span>
				<span class='text'>A move was made at the UN to give the seat for Cambodia to the Khmer Rouge; they prevailed by three votes</span>
				<span class='text'>n September 1974, Sar gathered the central committee of the party together</span>
				<span class='text'>As the military campaign was moving toward a conclusion, Sar decided to move the party toward implementing a socialist transformation of the country in the form of a series of decisions, the first being to evacuate the main cities, moving the population to the countryside</span>
				<span class='text'>The second dictated that they would cease putting money into circulation and quickly phase it out</span>
				<span class='text'>The final decision was that the party would accept Sar's first major purge</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1974, Sar had purged a top party official named Prasith</span>
				<span class='text'>Prasith was taken out into a forest and shot without being given any chance to defend himself</span>
				<span class='text'>His death was followed by a purge of cadres who, like Prasith, were ethnically [[Thai people|Thai]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Sar's explanation was that the [[class struggle]] had become acute, requiring a strong stand against party enemies</span>
				<span class='text'>he Khmer Rouge were positioned for a final offensive against the government in January 1975</span>
				<span class='text'>Simultaneously, at a press event in Beijing, Sihanouk proudly announced Sar's &quot;death list&quot; of enemies who were to be killed after victory</span>
				<span class='text'>The list, which originally contained seven names, was expanded to 23, and it included the names of all senior government leaders along with the names of all officials who were in positions of leadership within the police and military</span>
				<span class='text'>The rivalry between Vietnam and Cambodia also came out into the open</span>
				<span class='text'>[[North Vietnam]], as the rival socialist country in [[Indochina]], was determined to take [[Saigon]] before the Khmer Rouge took Phnom Penh</span>
				<span class='text'>Shipments of weapons from China were delayed, and in one instance the Cambodians were forced to sign a humiliating document thanking (North) Vietnam for shipments of Chinese weapons</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}In April 1975, the government formed a Supreme National Council with new leadership, with the aim of negotiating a surrender to the Khmer Rouge</span>
				<span class='text'>It was headed by [[Sak Sutsakhan]] who had studied in France with Sar, and was a cousin of the Khmer Rouge Deputy Secretary [[Nuon Chea]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Sar reacted to this by adding the names of everyone involved in the Supreme National Council onto his post-victory death list</span>

				<span class='text'>From 1971–1973, the motivation changed</span>

				<span class='text'>This alignment was more political and practical than ideological</span>
				<span class='text'>Vietnam was aligned with the Soviet Union, so Cambodia aligned with the Asian rival of the Soviet Union and of Vietnam (China had supplied the Khmer Rouge with weapons for years before they took power)</span>
				<span class='text'>n December 1976 Pol Pot issued directives to the senior Khmer Rouge leadership to the effect that Vietnam was now an enemy</span>
				<span class='text'>Defenses along the border were strengthened and unreliable deportees were moved deeper into Cambodia</span>
				<span class='text'>Pol Pot's actions came in response to the Vietnamese Communist Party's [[National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam|fourth Congress]] (14 to 20 December 1976), which approved a resolution describing Vietnam's special relationship with Laos and Cambodia</span>
				<span class='text'>It also talked of how Vietnam would forever be associated with the building and defense of the other two countries</span>
				<span class='text'>nlike many communist leaders, Pol Pot never became the object of a [[cult of personality|personality cult]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Even in power, the CPK maintained the secrecy it had kept up during its years in the battlefield</span>
				<span class='text'> For over two years after taking power, the party only referred to itself as &quot;[[Angkar]]&quot; (&quot;the Organization&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'> It was not until a speech on 15 April 1977 that Pol Pot revealed the CPK's existence</span>
				<span class='text'> At that time international observers confirmed the identification of &quot;Pol Pot&quot; as Saloth Sar</span>
				<span class='text'>=Conflict with Vietnam=={{Main|Cambodian–Vietnamese War}}In May 1975, a squad of Khmer Rouge soldiers raided and took [[Phu Quoc Island]]</span>
				<span class='text'>By 1977, relations with Vietnam began to fall apart</span>
				<span class='text'>There were small border clashes in January</span>
				<span class='text'>Pol Pot tried to prevent border disputes by sending a team to Vietnam</span>
				<span class='text'>The negotiations failed, which caused even more border disputes</span>
				<span class='text'>On 30 April, the Cambodian army, backed by artillery, crossed over into Vietnam</span>
				<span class='text'>In attempting to explain Pol Pot's behavior, one region-watcher{{Specify|date=October 2007}}&lt;!--and source, of course--&gt; suggested that Cambodia was attempting to intimidate Vietnam, by irrational acts, into respecting or at least fearing Cambodia to the point they would leave the country alone</span>
				<span class='text'>However, these actions only served to goad the Vietnamese people and government against the Khmer Rouge</span>
				<span class='text'>n May 1976, Vietnam sent its air force into Cambodia in a series of raids</span>
				<span class='text'>In July, Vietnam forced a Treaty of Friendship on [[Laos]] that gave Vietnam almost total control over the country</span>
				<span class='text'>In Cambodia, Khmer Rouge commanders in the Eastern Zone began to tell their men that war with Vietnam was inevitable and that once the war started their goal would be to recover parts of Vietnam (Khmer Krom) that were once part of Cambodia, whose people, they alleged, were struggling for independence from Vietnam</span>
				<span class='text'>Whether these statements were the official policy of Pol Pot has never been confirmed</span>
				<span class='text'>n September 1977, Cambodia launched [[Division (military)|division]]-scale raids over the border, which once again left a trail of murder and destruction in villages</span>
				<span class='text'>The Vietnamese claimed that around 1,000 people had been killed or injured</span>
				<span class='text'>Three days after the raid, Pol Pot officially announced the existence of the formerly secret Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK) and finally announced to the world that the country was a Communist state</span>
				<span class='text'>In December, after having exhausted all other options, Vietnam sent 50,000 troops into Cambodia in what amounted to a short raid</span>
				<span class='text'>The raid was meant to be secret</span>
				<span class='text'>The Vietnamese withdrew after declaring they had achieved their goals, and the invasion was just a warning</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon being threatened, the Vietnamese army promised to return with support from the Soviet Union</span>
				<span class='text'>Pol Pot's actions made the operation much more visible than the Vietnamese had intended and created a situation in which Vietnam appeared weak</span>
				<span class='text'>fter making one final attempt to negotiate a settlement with Cambodia, Vietnam decided that it had to prepare for a full war</span>
				<span class='text'>Vietnam also tried to pressure Cambodia through China</span>
				<span class='text'>However, China's refusal to pressure Cambodia and the flow of weapons from China into Cambodia were both signs that China also intended to act against Vietnam</span>
				<span class='text'>hen Cambodian socialists rebelled in the eastern zone in May 1978, Pol Pot's armies could not crush them quickly</span>
				<span class='text'>On 10 May, his radio broadcast a call not only to &quot;exterminate the 50&amp;nbsp;million Vietnamese&quot; but also to &quot;purify the masses of the people&quot; of Cambodia</span>
				<span class='text'>Of 1</span>
				<span class='text'>&amp;nbsp;million easterners, branded as &quot;Khmer bodies with Vietnamese minds&quot;, at least 100,000 were exterminated in six months</span>
				<span class='text'>Later that year, in response to threats to its borders and the Vietnamese people, Vietnam attacked Cambodia to overthrow the Khmer Rouge, which Vietnam justified on the basis of self-defense</span>

				<span class='text'>In January 1979, Vietnam installed a new government under Khmer Rouge defector [[Heng Samrin]], composed of Khmer Rouge who had fled to Vietnam to avoid the purges</span>
				<span class='text'>Pol Pot eventually regrouped with his core supporters in the Thai border area where he received shelter and assistance</span>
				<span class='text'>At different times during this period, he was located on both sides of the border</span>
				<span class='text'>The military government of Thailand used the Khmer Rouge as a buffer force to keep the Vietnamese away from the border</span>
				<span class='text'>The Thai military also made money from the shipment of weapons from China to the Khmer Rouge</span>
				<span class='text'>Eventually, Pol Pot rebuilt a small military force in the west of the country with the help of the People's Republic of China</span>
				<span class='text'>The PRC also initiated the [[Sino-Vietnamese War]] around this time</span>
				<span class='text'>he [[China|People's Republic of China]] was the main international supporter of the Khmer Rouge and its leader Pol Pot</span>

				<span class='text'>He said he was like the master in a house he didn't know what the kids were up to, and that he trusted people too much</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, he allowed [one person] to take care of central committee business for him, [another person] to take care of intellectuals, and [a third person] to take care of political education</span>
