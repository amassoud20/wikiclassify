				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|180px|Sigismund of Luxemburg, official imprint]]Born in [[Nuremberg]], Sigismund was the son of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]], and of his fourth wife, [[Elizabeth of Pomerania]], the granddaughter of [[King of Poland|King]] [[Casimir III of Poland]], and the great-granddaughter of the [[List of rulers of Lithuania|Grand Duke of Lithuania]], [[Gediminas]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was named after [[Saint Sigismund of Burgundy]], the favourite saint of Sigismund's father</span>
				<span class='text'>From Sigismund's childhood he was nicknamed the &quot;ginger fox&quot; (''liška ryšavá'') in the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|Crown of Bohemia]], on account of his hair colour</span>
				<span class='text'>King [[Louis the Great|Louis the Great of Hungary and Poland]] always had a good and close relationship with Emperor Charles IV, and Sigismund was [[Betrothal|betrothed]] to Louis' eldest daughter, [[Mary, Queen of Hungary|Mary]], in 1374, when he was six years old</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon his father's death in 1378, young Sigismund became [[Margrave of Brandenburg]] and was sent to the Hungarian court, where he soon learnt the Hungarian language and way of life, and became entirely devoted to his adopted country</span>
				<span class='text'>King Louis named him as his heir and appointed him his successor as [[King of Hungary]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1381, the then 13-year-old Sigismund was sent to [[Kraków]] by his eldest half-brother and guardian [[Wenceslaus, King of the Romans|Wenceslaus, King of Germany and Bohemia]], to learn [[Polish language|Polish]] and to become acquainted with the land and its people</span>
				<span class='text'>King Wenceslaus also gave him [[Neumark]] to facilitate communication between Brandenburg and Poland</span>
				<span class='text'>he disagreement between Polish landlords of [[Lesser Poland]] on one side and landlords of [[Greater Poland]] on the other, regarding the choice of the future King of Poland, finally ended in choosing the Lithuanian side; the support of the lords of Greater Poland was not enough to give Prince Sigismund the Polish crown</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, the landlords of Lesser Poland gave it to Mary's younger sister [[Jadwiga I of Poland]], who married [[Jogaila]] of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]]</span>

				<span class='text'>The next year, he was accepted as Mary's future co-ruler by the [[Treaty of Győr (1386)|Treaty of Győr]]</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Mary was captured, together with her mother, [[Elizabeth of Bosnia]], who had acted as regent, in 1387 by the rebellious [[House of Horvat]], Bishop [[Paul Horvat]] of [[Mačva]], his brother [[John Horvat]] and younger brother Ladislav</span>
				<span class='text'>Sigismund's mother-in-law was strangled, while Mary was liberated</span>
				<span class='text'>aving secured the support of the nobility, Sigismund was crowned [[King of Hungary]] at [[Székesfehérvár]] on 31 March 1387</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Having raised money by pledging [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] to his cousin [[Jobst of Moravia|Jobst, margrave of Moravia]] (1388), he was engaged for the next nine years in a ceaseless struggle for the possession of this unstable throne</span>
				<span class='text'>The central power was finally weakened to such an extent that only Sigismund's alliance with the powerful Czillei-Garai League could ensure his position on the throne</span>

				<span class='text'>om/images/Ungarn/hunhist_II</span>
				<span class='text'>tml&lt;/ref&gt; It was not for entirely selfless reasons that one of the leagues of barons helped him to power: Sigismund had to pay for the support of the lords by transferring a sizable part of the royal properties</span>
				<span class='text'>(For some years, the baron's council governed the country in the name of the [[Holy Crown]])</span>
				<span class='text'>The restoration of the authority of the central administration took decades of work</span>
				<span class='text'>The bulk of the nation headed by the [[House of Garai]] was with him; but in the southern provinces between the [[Sava]] and the [[Drava]], the Horvathys with the support of King [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia]], Mary's maternal uncle, proclaimed as their king [[Ladislaus, king of Naples]], son of the murdered [[Charles II of Hungary]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Not until 1395 did [[Nicholas II Garay]] succeed in suppressing them</span>
				<span class='text'>Mary died heavily pregnant in 1395</span>
				<span class='text'>o ease the pressure from Hungarian nobles, Sigismud tried to employ foreign advisors which was not popular and he had to promise to not give land and nominations to other than Hungarian nobles</span>
				<span class='text'>However, this was not applied to [[Stibor of Stiboricz]] who was Sigismund's closest friend and advisor</span>
				<span class='text'>On a number of occasions, Sigismund was imprisoned by nobles, but with help of the armies of Garai and Stibor of Stiboricz, he would regain power</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1396 Sigismund led the combined armies of Christendom against the Turks, who had taken advantage of the temporary helplessness of Hungary to extend their dominion to the banks of the [[Danube]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This crusade, preached by [[Pope Boniface IX]], was very popular in Hungary</span>
				<span class='text'>The nobles flocked in the thousands to the royal standard, and were reinforced by volunteers from nearly every part of Europe, the most important contingent being that of the [[Kingdom of France|French]] led by [[John the Fearless]], son of [[Philip II, Duke of Burgundy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Sigismund set out with 90,000 men and a flotilla of 70 galleys</span>
				<span class='text'>After capturing [[Vidin]], he camped with his Hungarian armies before the fortress of [[Nicopolis, Bulgaria|Nicopolis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Sultan [[Bayezid I]] raised the siege of Constantinople and, at the head of 140,000 men, completely defeated the [[Christianity|Christian]] forces in the [[Battle of Nicopolis]] fought between the 25 and 28 September 1396</span>
				<span class='text'>Sigismund returned by sea and through the realm of [[Principality of Zeta|Zeta]], where he ordained a local [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrin]] lord [[Đurađ II]] with the islands of [[Hvar]] and [[Korčula]] for resistance against the Turks, which were returned to Sigismund after Durad's death in April 1403</span>
				<span class='text'>he disaster in Nicopolis angered several Hungarian lords, leading to instability in the kingdom</span>
				<span class='text'>Deprived of his authority in Hungary, Sigismund then turned his attention to securing the succession in [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], and was recognized by his childless half-brother [[Wenceslaus, King of the Romans|Wenceslaus IV]] as Vicar-General of the whole Empire</span>
				<span class='text'>However, he was unable to support Wenceslaus when he was deposed in 1400 and [[Rupert of Germany]], Elector Palatine, was elected [[King of Germany|German king]] in his stead</span>
				<span class='text'>n his return to Hungary in 1401, Sigismund was imprisoned once and deposed twice</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1401 Sigismund helped an uprising against Wenceslaus, during the course of which the [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]]n king was taken prisoner, and Sigismund ruled Bohemia for nineteen months</span>
				<span class='text'>He released Wenceslaus in 1403</span>
				<span class='text'>In the meantime, a group of Hungarian noblemen swore loyalty to the last Anjou monarch, [[Ladislaus of Naples]], putting their hands on the relic of Saint Ladislas of Hungary in Nagyvárad</span>
				<span class='text'>Ladislaus was the son of the murdered [[Charles II of Hungary]], and thus a distant relative of the long dead King [[Louis I of Hungary]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Ladislaus captured [[Zadar]] in 1403, but soon stopped any military advance</span>
				<span class='text'>This struggle in turn led to a war with the [[Republic of Venice]], as Ladislaus had sold the [[Dalmatia]]n cities to the Venetians for 100,000 ducats before leaving for his own land</span>
				<span class='text'>In the following years Sigismund acted indirectly to thwart Ladislaus' attempts to conquer central Italy, by allying with the Italian cities resisting him and by applying diplomatic pressure on him</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1404 he introduced the ''Placetum Regium''</span>
				<span class='text'>According to this decree, [[Papal bull]]s could not be pronounced in Hungary without the consent of the king</span>
				<span class='text'>n about 1406 Sigismund married Mary's cousin [[Barbara of Celje]] (Barbara Celjska, nicknamed the &quot;[[Messalina]] of Germany&quot;), daughter of Count [[Hermann II of Celje]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Hermann's mother Katarina Kotromanić (of the House of [[Kotromanic]]) and Mary's mother Queen Elizabeta ([[Elisabeth of Bosnia]]) were sisters, or cousins who were adoptive sisters</span>
				<span class='text'>Tvrtko I was their first cousin and adopted brother, and perhaps even became heir apparent to Queen Mary</span>
				<span class='text'>Tvrtko may have been murdered in 1391 on Sigismund's order{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}</span>
				<span class='text'>igismund founded his personal order of knights, the [[Order of the Dragon]], after this{{which|date=January 2015}} victory</span>
				<span class='text'>Members of the order were mostly his political allies and supporters</span>
				<span class='text'>The most important European monarchs became members of the order</span>
				<span class='text'>He encouraged international trade by abolishing internal duties, regulating tariffs on foreign goods and standardizing weights and measures throughout the country</span>
				<span class='text'>Due to his frequent absences attending to business in the other countries over which he ruled, he was obliged to consult Diets in Hungary with more frequency than his predecessors and institute the office of Palatine as chief administrator while he was away</span>

				<span class='text'>=== King of Croatia ====In [[Slavonia]] he managed to establish control</span>
				<span class='text'>He did not hesitate to use violent methods (see [[Bloody Sabor of Križevci]]) but from the river Sava to the south his control was weak</span>
				<span class='text'>Sigismund personally led an army of almost 50,000 &quot;crusaders&quot; against the [[Croats]] and [[Bosnians]], which culminated in 1408 with the [[Battle of Dobor]], and a massacre of about 200 [[nobility|noble]] families, many of them victors{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} of numerous battles against the Ottomans</span>
				<span class='text'>== King of the Romans ===After the death of King [[Rupert of Germany]] in 1410, Sigismund – ignoring the claims of his half-brother Wenceslaus – was elected as successor by three of the [[prince-elector|elector]]s on 10 September 1410, but he was opposed by his cousin [[Jobst of Moravia]], who had been elected by four electors in a different election on 1 October</span>
				<span class='text'>Jobst's death 18 January 1411 removed this conflict and Sigismund was again elected king on 21 July 1411</span>
				<span class='text'>His [[coronation]] was deferred until 8 November 1414, when it took place at [[Aachen]]</span>
				<span class='text'>== Anti-Polish alliances ===On a number of occasions, and in 1410 in particular, Sigismund allied himself with the [[Teutonic Knights]] against [[Jogaila|Władysław II]] of Poland</span>
				<span class='text'>In return for 300</span>
				<span class='text'>00 ducats he would attack [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Poland]] from the south after the truce on St</span>
				<span class='text'>John's Day, 24 June expired</span>
				<span class='text'>Sigismund gave his most loyal friend [[Stibor of Stiboricz]] order to set up the attack on Poland</span>
				<span class='text'>Stibor of Stiboricz was of Polish origin and from the main line of the powerful [[Clan of Ostoja]] that also was against of choosing Jagiello as King of Poland in the beginning</span>
				<span class='text'>With the support of Sigismund, Stibor become one of the most influential men in late medieval Europe, holding titles as [[Duke]] of [[Transylvania]] and owning about 25% of [[Slovakia]] of today including 31 castles of which 15 were situated around the 406&amp;nbsp;km long [[Váh]] river with surrounding land that was given to him by Sigismund</span>
				<span class='text'>In the diplomatic struggle to prevent war between Poland-Lithuania, which was supported by the Muscovites, and the Teutonic Knights, Sigismund used Stibors fine diplomacy to gain financially</span>
				<span class='text'>The Polish side appointed several negotiators and most of them were also from the Clan of Ostoja, being distantly related to the Stibors</span>
				<span class='text'>However, those &quot;family meetings&quot; could not prevent the war and an alliance of twenty-two western states formed an army against Poland in the [[Battle of Grunwald]] in July 1410</span>
				<span class='text'>Stibor attacked then [[Nowy Sącz]] and burned it down to the ground but after that, he returned with his army back home at the [[Beckov Castle]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After Polish-Lithuanian victory in the [[Battle of Grunwald]], Teutonic knights had to pay huge sum of silver to Poland as reparation and again, through diplomacy of his friend Stibor, Sigismund could borrow all this silver from King Władysław II of Poland on good conditions</span>
				<span class='text'>In the light of facts about the diplomatic work of Stibor and the Clan of Ostoja that was following the politics of King Sigismund, one can question if Sigismund really joined the anti-Polish alliance in reality</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Sigismund and Barbara of Celje at the Council of Constance</span>
				<span class='text'>]=== Council of Constance ===From 1412 to 1423 he campaigned against the [[Venetia (region)|Venetia]]ns in [[Italy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The king took advantage of the difficulties of [[Antipope John XXIII]] to obtain a promise that a [[council of Constance|council]] should be called in [[Constance]] in 1414 to settle the [[Western Schism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He took a leading part in the deliberations of this assembly, and during the sittings made a journey to [[Kingdom of France|France]], [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundy]] in a vain attempt to secure the abdication of the three rival popes</span>
				<span class='text'>The council ended in 1418, solving the Schism and — of great consequence to Sigismund's future career — having the [[Czech people|Czech]] religious reformer, [[Jan Hus]], [[execution by burning|burned at the stake]] for [[heresy]] in July 1415</span>
				<span class='text'>The complicity of Sigismund in the death of Hus is a matter of controversy</span>
				<span class='text'>He had granted him a [[safe conduct|safe-conduct]] and protested against his imprisonment; and the reformer was burned during his absence</span>
				<span class='text'>t was also at this Council that a cardinal ventured to correct Sigismund's [[Latin]] (he had construed the word ''schisma'' as feminine rather than neuter)</span>
				<span class='text'>To this Sigismund replied:{{quote|I am king of the Romans and above grammar</span>

				<span class='text'>rg}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}An alliance with England against France, and a failed attempt, owing to the hostility of the princes, to secure peace in Germany by a league of the towns, were his main acts during these years</span>
				<span class='text'>Also, Sigismund granted control of the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]] (which he had received back after Jobst's death) to [[Frederick I, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick I]] of [[Hohenzollern]], burgrave of [[Nuremberg]] (1415)</span>
				<span class='text'>This step made the Hohenzollern family one of the most important in Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>igismund began to shift his alliance from France to England after the French defeat at the [[Battle of Agincourt]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Treaty of Canterbury (August 15, 1416) culminated diplomatic efforts between [[Henry V of England]] and Sigismund and resulted in a defensive and offensive alliance against France</span>
				<span class='text'>This, in turn, led the way to the resolution of the [[Western Schism|papal schism]]</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Portrait of Emperor Sigismund, painted by [[Albrecht Dürer]] after the emperor's death]]In 1419, the death of [[Wenceslaus, King of the Romans|Wenceslaus IV]] left Sigismund titular [[King of Bohemia]], but he had to wait for seventeen years before the [[Czechs]] would acknowledge him</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the two dignities of King of the Romans and King of Bohemia added considerably to his importance, and indeed made him the nominal temporal head of [[Christianity|Christendom]], they conferred no increase of power and financially embarrassed him</span>
				<span class='text'>It was only as [[King of Hungary]] that he had succeeded in establishing his authority and in doing anything for the order and good government of the land</span>
				<span class='text'>Entrusting the government of Bohemia to [[Sofia of Bavaria]], the widow of Wenceslaus, he hastened into [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]]</span>
				<span class='text'>he Bohemians, who distrusted him as the betrayer of [[Jan Hus|Hus]], were soon in arms; and the flame was fanned when Sigismund declared his intention of prosecuting the war against heretics</span>
				<span class='text'>Three campaigns against the [[Hussites]] ended in disaster although the army of his most loyal ally [[Stibor of Stiboricz]] and later his son [[Stibor of Beckov]] could hold the Hussite side away from the borders of the Kingdom</span>
				<span class='text'>The Turks were again attacking Hungary</span>
				<span class='text'>The king, unable to obtain support from the German princes, was powerless in Bohemia</span>
				<span class='text'>His attempts at the diet of [[Nuremberg]] in 1422 to raise a mercenary army were foiled by the resistance of the towns; and in 1424 the electors, among whom was Sigismund's former ally, [[Frederick I, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick I of Hohenzollern]], sought to strengthen their own authority at the expense of the king</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the scheme failed, the danger to Germany from the Hussites led to the Union of Bingen, which virtually deprived Sigismund of the leadership of the war and the headship of Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1428 he led another campaign against the Turks, but again with few results</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1431 he went to [[Milan]] where on 25 November he received the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy|Iron Crown]]; after which he remained for some time at [[Siena]], negotiating for his [[coronation]] as emperor and for the recognition of the Council of Basel by Pope [[Eugenius IV]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was crowned emperor in [[Rome]] on 31 May 1433, and after obtaining his demands from the Pope returned to Bohemia, where he was recognized as king in 1436, though his power was little more than nominal</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1435, Sigismund sent [[Fruzhin]], a Bulgarian nobleman, to negotiate an alliance with the Albanians</span>

				<span class='text'>As he left no sons his line of the [[House of Luxembourg]] became extinct on his death</span>
				<span class='text'>= Family and issue ==Sigismund married twice but had little luck in securing the succession to his crowns</span>
				<span class='text'>Each of his two marriages resulted in the birth of one child</span>
				<span class='text'>His [[Childbirth|first-born]] child, probably a son, was born prematurely as a result of a horse riding accident suffered by Queen [[Mary of Hungary]] when she was well advanced in pregnancy</span>
				<span class='text'>Mother and child both died shortly after the birth in the hills of [[Buda]] on 17 May 1395</span>
				<span class='text'>This caused a deep succession crisis because Sigismund ruled over [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] by right of his wife, and although he managed to keep his power, the crisis lasted until his second marriage to [[Barbara of Celje]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Barbara's only child, [[born in the purple]] on 7 October 1409, probably in the castle of [[Visegrád]], was [[Elisabeth of Luxembourg]], the future [[queen consort]] of Hungary, Germany and Bohemia</span>
				<span class='text'>Queen Barbara was unable to give birth to any further issue</span>

				<span class='text'>According to this, [[John Hunyadi]] was Sigismund's illegitimate son</span>
				<span class='text'>Sigismund gave a ring to the boy's mother when he was born, but one day in the forest a raven stole it from her, and the ring was only recovered after the bird was hunted down</span>
				<span class='text'>It is said that this incident inspired the coat of arms of the [[Hunyadi family|Hunyadi]]s, and later also appeared in the coat of arms of Matthias &quot;Corvinus&quot;</span>
