				<span class='text'>Niemeyer was best known for his design of civic buildings for [[Brasília]], a [[planned city]] that became Brazil's capital in 1960, as well as his collaboration with other architects on the [[United Nations Headquarters]] in [[New York City]]</span>

				<span class='text'>I am attracted to free-flowing, sensual curves</span>

				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;62 and 169–70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Born in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Niemeyer was schooled at the city's [[Escola Nacional de Belas Artes]] ([[Federal University of Rio de Janeiro]]), and after graduating worked at his father's [[typography]] house, and as a [[Architectural drafting|draftsman]] for local architectural firms</span>
				<span class='text'>In the 1930s, he interned with [[Lúcio Costa]], with the pair collaborating on the design for the [[Gustavo Capanema Palace|Palácio Gustavo Capanema]] in Rio de Janeiro</span>
				<span class='text'>Niemeyer's first major project was a series of buildings for [[Pampulha]], a planned suburb north of [[Belo Horizonte]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His work, especially on the [[Church of Saint Francis of Assisi]], received critical acclaim and drew international attention</span>
				<span class='text'>Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, Niemeyer became one of Brazil's most prolific architects, working both domestically and overseas</span>
				<span class='text'>This included the design of the [[Edifício Copan]] (a large residential building in [[São Paulo]]) and a collaboration with Le Corbusier (and others) on the United Nations Headquarters, which yielded invitations to teach at [[Yale University]] and the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1956, Niemeyer was invited by Brazil's new president, [[Juscelino Kubitschek]], to design the civic buildings for Brazil's new capital, which was to be built in the centre of the country, far from any existing cities</span>
				<span class='text'>His designs for the [[National Congress of Brazil]], the [[Cathedral of Brasília]], the [[Cultural Complex of the Republic]], the [[Palácio da Alvorada]], the [[Palácio do Planalto]], and the [[Supreme Federal Court]], all completed by 1960, were experimental and linked by common design elements</span>
				<span class='text'>This work led to his appointment as inaugural head of architecture at the [[University of Brasília]], as well as honorary membership of the [[American Institute of Architects]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Due to his largely leftist ideology, and involvement with the [[Brazilian Communist Party]] (PCB), Niemeyer left the country after the [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état|1964 military coup]] and opened an office in [[Paris]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He returned to Brazil in 1985, and was awarded the prestigious [[Pritzker Architecture Prize]] in 1988</span>
				<span class='text'>A socialist and atheist from an early age, Niemeyer had spent time in both [[Cuba]] and the [[Soviet Union]] during his exile, and on his return served as the PCB's president from 1992 to 1996</span>
				<span class='text'>Niemeyer continued working at the end of the 20th and early 21st century, notably designing the [[Niterói Contemporary Art Museum]] (1996) and the [[Oscar Niemeyer Museum]] (2002)</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In 1928, at age 21, Niemeyer left school (Santo Antonio Maria Zaccaria priory school) and married Annita Baldo,&lt;ref name=&quot;Matthieu Salvaing, Oscar Niemeyer&quot;/&gt; daughter of Italian immigrants from [[Padua]]</span>
				<span class='text'>e pursued his passion at the National School of Fine Arts in Rio de Janeiro ([[Escola Nacional de Belas Artes]]) and graduated with a BA in architecture in 1934</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Matthieu Salvaing, Oscar Niemeyer&quot; /&gt;==Early career==After graduating, he worked in his father's [[typography|typography house]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Even though he was not financially stable, he insisted on working in the architecture studio of [[Lucio Costa]], [[Gregori Warchavchik]] and Carlos Leão, even though they could not pay him</span>
				<span class='text'>Niemeyer joined them as a draftsman, an art that he mastered (Corbusier himself would later compliment Niemeyer's 'beautiful perspectives'</span>

				<span class='text'>Taylor &amp; Francis</span>
				<span class='text'>ISBN 0415234077&lt;/ref&gt;) The contact with Costa would be extremely important to Niemeyer's maturation</span>
				<span class='text'>Costa, after an initial flirtation with the Neocolonial movement, realized that the advances of the international style in Europe were the way forward for architecture</span>
				<span class='text'>His writings on the insights that could unite Brazil's traditional colonial architecture (such as that in [[Olinda]]) with modernist principles would be the basis of the architecture that he and his contemporaries, such as [[Affonso Eduardo Reidy]], would later realize</span>
				<span class='text'>[image:MESP4</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|[[Gustavo Capanema Palace|Ministry of Education and Health]], Rio de Janeiro]]In 1936, at 29, [[Lucio Costa]] was appointed by Education Minister Gustavo Capanema to design the new headquarters of the [[Gustavo Capanema Palace|Ministry of Education and Health]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Costa himself, although open to change, was unsure of how to proceed</span>
				<span class='text'>He assembled a group of young architects (Carlos Leão, Affonso Eduardo Reidy, Jorge Moreira and Ernani Vasconcellos) to design the building</span>
				<span class='text'>He also insisted that [[Le Corbusier]] himself should be invited as a consultant</span>
				<span class='text'>Though Niemeyer was not initially part of the team, Costa agreed to accept him after Niemeyer insisted</span>
				<span class='text'>During the period of Le Corbusier's stay in Rio, he was appointed to help the master with his drafts, which allowed him a close contact with the Swiss</span>
				<span class='text'>After his departure, Niemeyer's significant changes to Corbusier's scheme impressed Costa, who allowed him to progressively take charge of the project, of which he assumed leadership in 1939</span>
				<span class='text'>==Brazilian modernism===The Ministry had assumed the task of shaping the 'novo homem, Brasileiro e moderno' (new man, Brazilian and modern)</span>
				<span class='text'>It was the first state-sponsored [[modernism|modernist]] skyscraper in the world, of a much larger scale than anything Le Corbusier had built until then</span>
				<span class='text'>{fact|date=December 2015}} Completed in 1943, when he was 36 years old, the building that housed the regulator and manager of Brazilian culture and cultural heritage developed the elements of what was to become recognized as Brazilian modernism</span>
				<span class='text'>It employed local materials and techniques, like the [[azulejo]]s linked to the Portuguese tradition; the revolutionized Corbusian [[brises-soleil]], made adjustable and related to the Moorish shading devices of colonial architecture; bold colors; the tropical gardens of [[Roberto Burle Marx]]; the [[Roystonea|Imperial Palm]] (''Roystonea oleracea''), known as the Brazilian order; further allusions to the icons of the Brazilian landscape; and specially commissioned works by Brazilian artists</span>
				<span class='text'>This building is considered by some architects as one of the most influential of the 20th century</span>
				<span class='text'>It was taken as a model on how to blend low- and high-rise structures ([[Lever House]])</span>
				<span class='text'>==New York World's Fair===In 1939, at age 32, Niemeyer and Costa designed the Brazilian pavilion for the [[1939 New York World's Fair|New York World's Fair]] (executed in collaboration with [[Paul Lester Wiener]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Neighbouring the much larger French pavilion, the Brazilian structure contrasted with its heavy mass</span>
				<span class='text'>Costa explained that the Brazilian Pavilion adopted a language of 'grace and elegance', lightness and spatial fluidity, with an open plan, curves and free walls, which he termed 'Ionic', contrasting it to the mainstream contemporary modernist architecture, which he termed 'Doric'</span>
				<span class='text'>Impressed by its avant-garde design, Mayor [[Fiorello La Guardia]] awarded Niemeyer the keys to the city of New York</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1937, Niemeyer was invited by a relative to design a nursery for philanthropic institution which catered for young mothers, the ''Obra do Berço''</span>
				<span class='text'>It would become his first finalised work</span>

				<span class='text'>19&lt;/ref&gt; However, Niemeyer has claimed that his architecture really began in Pampulha, Minas Gerais, and as he explained in an interview, ''Pampulha was the starting point of this freer architecture full of curves which I still love even today</span>
				<span class='text'>It was in fact, the beginning of Brasília </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>'</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Matthieu Salvaing, Oscar Niemeyer&quot;/&gt;==The Pampulha Project==[[File:Marquise Casa do Baile</span>
				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|300px|left|The free-form marquee at Casa do Baile]]In 1940, at 33, Niemeyer met [[Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira|Juscelino Kubitschek]], who was at the time the mayor of [[Belo Horizonte]], capital of the state of [[Minas Gerais]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Kubitschek, together with the state's governor Benedito Valadares, wanted to develop a new suburb to the north of the city called [[Pampulha]] and commissioned Niemeyer to design a series of buildings which would become known as the &quot;Pampulha architectural complex&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The complex included a casino, a restaurant/dance hall, a yacht club, a golf club and a church, all of which would be distributed around a new artificial lake</span>
				<span class='text'>A weekend retreat for the mayor was built near the lake</span>
				<span class='text'>he buildings were completed in 1943 and received international acclaim following the 1943 'Brazil Builds' exhibition, at the New York [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA)</span>
				<span class='text'>Most of the buildings show Niemeyer's particular approach to the Corbusian language</span>
				<span class='text'>In the casino, with its relatively rigid main façade, Niemeyer departed from Corbusian principles and designed curved volumes outside the confinement of a rational grid</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Comas, Carlos Eduardo (2005) &quot;Niemeyer's Casino and the Misdeeds of Brazilian Architecture&quot;, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>169–188 in ''Critical Studies, Transculturation</span>
				<span class='text'>Cities, Spaces and Architectures in Latin America''</span>
				<span class='text'>Felipe Hernández, Mark Millington and Iain Borden (eds</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt; He also expanded upon Corbusier's idea of a ''promenade architecturale'' with his designs for floating catwalk-like ramps which unfold open vistas to the occupants</span>
				<span class='text'>he small restaurant (Casa do Baile), which is perhaps the least ''bourgeois'' of the complex, is built on its own artificial island and comprises an approximately circular block from which a free-form marquee follows the contour of the island</span>
				<span class='text'>Although free form had been used even in Corbusier's and Mies's architecture, its application on an outdoors marquee was Niemeyer's innovation</span>
				<span class='text'>This application of free-form, together with the butterfly roof used at the Yacht Club and Kubitschek's house became extremely fashionable from then on</span>
				<span class='text'>[Image:IgrejaPampulha</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|250px|[[Church of Saint Francis of Assisi|São Francisco de Assis Church]], Belo Horizonte City, Minas Gerais, Brazil]]The [[Saint Francis of Assisi]] church is considered the masterpiece of the complex</span>
				<span class='text'>When it was built, [[reinforced concrete]] was used in traditional ways, such as in pillar, beam and slab structures</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Auguste Perret]], in Casablanca and [[Robert Maillart]] in Zurich had experimented with the plastic freedom of concrete, taking advantage of the parabolic arch's geometry to build extremely thin shells</span>
				<span class='text'>Niemeyer's decision to use such an economical approach, based on the inherent plasticity allowed by reinforced concrete was revolutionary</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Joaquim Cardoso,&lt;ref&gt;Matoso, Danilo (2008)  [http://bd</span>

				<span class='text'>ISBN 978-85-736-5534-6&lt;/ref&gt; the unification of wall and roof into a single element was revolutionary for fusing vertical and horizontal elements</span>
				<span class='text'>The church's exuberance added to the integration between architecture and art</span>
				<span class='text'>The church is covered by Azulejos by [[Cândido Portinari|Portinari]] and tile murals by Paulo Werneck</span>
				<span class='text'>It led to the church being seen as [[baroque]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Though some European purists condemned its formalism, the fact that the form's idea was directly linked to a logical, structural reason placed the building in the 20th century, while refusing to break completely from the past</span>
				<span class='text'>ue to its importance in the history of architecture, the church was the first listed modern building in Brazil</span>
				<span class='text'>This fact did not influence the conservative church authorities of Minas Gerais, who refused to consecrate it until 1959, in part because of its unorthodox form and in part because of Portinari's altar [[mural]], which depicts Saint Francis as the savior of the ill, the poor and, most importantly, the sinner</span>
				<span class='text'>iemayer claimed that Pampulha offered him the opportunity to 'challenge the monotony of contemporary architecture, the wave of misinterpreted functionalism that hindered it and the dogmas of form and function that had emerged, counteracting the plastic freedom that reinforced concrete introduced</span>
				<span class='text'>I was attracted by the curve – the liberated, sensual curve suggested by the possibilities of new technology yet so often recalled in venerable old baroque churches</span>
				<span class='text'>[</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> I deliberately disregarded the right angle and rationalist architecture designed with ruler and square to boldly enter the world of curves and straight lines offered by reinforced concrete</span>
				<span class='text'>[</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> This deliberate protest arose from the environment in which I lived, with its white beaches, its huge mountains, its old baroque churches and the beautiful suntanned women</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;ref name=&quot;Niemeyer, Oscar 2000, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>62&quot;/&gt;The experience also marked the first collaborations between Niemeyer and [[Roberto Burle Marx]], considered the most important modern landscape architect</span>

				<span class='text'>Niemeyer's scheme 32 was approved by the Board of Design, but he eventually gave in to pressure by Le Corbusier, and together they submitted project 23/32 (developed with Bodiansky and Weissmann), which combined elements from Niemeyer's and Le Corbusier's schemes</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1950 he was asked to design [[São Paulo (city)|São Paulo]]'s [[Ibirapuera Park]] for the city's 400th anniversary celebration</span>
				<span class='text'>The plan, which consisted of several porticoed pavilions related via a gigantic free form marquee, had to be simplified due to cost</span>
				<span class='text'>The resulting buildings were less interesting individually, which meant that the ensemble effect became the dominant aesthetic experience</span>
				<span class='text'>Niemeyer developed V-shaped pilotis for the project, which became fashionable for a time</span>
				<span class='text'>A variation on that theme was the W-shaped piloti which supports the [[JK Building|Governador Juscelino Kubitschek]] housing complex (1951), two large buildings containing around 1,000 apartments</span>
				<span class='text'>Its design was based on Niemeyer's scheme for the Quitandinha apartment hotel in [[Petrópolis]] designed one year earlier, but never realised</span>

				<span class='text'>This landmark represents a microcosm of the diverse population of the city</span>
				<span class='text'>Its horizontality, which is emphasized by the concrete brise-soleil, together with the fact that it was a residential building made it an interesting approach to popular housing, given that in the 1950s suburbanization had begun and city centres were being occupied primarily by business, usually occupying vertical &quot;masculine&quot; buildings, as opposed to Niemeyer's &quot;feminine&quot; approach</span>

				<span class='text'>Retrieved December 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954 Niemeyer also designed the &quot;Niemeyer apartment building&quot; at the [[Praça da Liberdade]], Belo Horizonte</span>
				<span class='text'>The building's completely free form layout is reminiscent of [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe|Mies van der Rohe's]] 1922 glass skyscraper, although with a much more material feel than the airy German one</span>
				<span class='text'>Also in 1954 as part of the same plaza Niemeyer built a library the (Biblioteca Pública Estadual)</span>
				<span class='text'>uring this period Niemeyer built several residences</span>
				<span class='text'>Among them were a weekend house for his father, in Mendes (1949), developed from a chicken coop, the Prudente de Morais Neto house, in Rio (1943–49), based on Niemeyer's original design for Kubitschek's house in Pampulha, a house for Gustavo Capanema (1947) (the minister who commissioned the Ministry of Education and Health building), the Leonel Miranda house (1952), featuring two spiral ramps which provide access to the butterfly-roofed first floor, lifted up on oblique piloti</span>
				<span class='text'>These houses featured the same inclined façade used in the Tremaine design, which allowed good natural lighting</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1954 he built the famous Cavanelas house, with its tent-like metallic roof and which, with the help of Burle Marx's gardens, is perfectly adapted to its mountainous site</span>

				<span class='text'>ISBN 0847827984&lt;/ref&gt; However, his residential (and free-form architecture) masterpiece is considered to be the 1953 Canoas House Niemeyer built for himself</span>
				<span class='text'>The house is located on sloped terrain overlooking the ocean from afar</span>
				<span class='text'>It comprises two floors, the first of which is under a free form roof, supported on thin metallic columns</span>
				<span class='text'>The living quarters is located on the floor below and is more traditionally divided</span>
				<span class='text'>The design takes advantage of the uneven terrain so that the house seems not to disturb the landscape</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the house is extremely well-suited to its environment, it did not escape criticism</span>
				<span class='text'>Niemeyer recalled that [[Walter Gropius]], who was visiting the country as a jury in the second Biennial exhibition in São Paulo, argued that the house could not be mass-produced, to which Niemeyer responded that the house was designed with himself in mind and for that particular site, not a general flat one</span>

				<span class='text'>Niemeyer's architecture in particular was criticised by [[Max Bill]] in an interview for Manchete Magazine</span>

				<span class='text'>He even belittled Niemeyer's V piloti, as purely aesthetic</span>
				<span class='text'>iemeyer's first response was denial, followed by a counterattack based on Bill's patronizing attitude, which prevented him from considering the differing social and economic realities of Brazil and European countries</span>
				<span class='text'>Costa also stressed that Brazilian (and Niemeyer's) architecture was based on unskilled work which allowed for a crafted architecture based on concrete, expressing a tradition of (Brazilian) church builders, as opposed to (Swiss) clock builders</span>

				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|Edifício Califórnia, São Paulo]]Although it was badly received and to an extent an exaggeration, Bill's words were effective in bringing to attention the mediocre architecture coming from less talented architects, who employed Niemeyer's vocabulary in the decorative fashion that Bill had criticised</span>
				<span class='text'>Niemeyer himself admitted that for a certain period he had &quot;handled too many commissions, executing them in a hurry, trusting the improvisational skills he believed to have&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Usually neglected by its creator, it features the V piloti which had worked so well in isolated buildings, creating a different treatment to that space without the need for two separate structural systems as Corbusier had done in Marseille</span>
				<span class='text'>Its use in a typical urban context was formalistic and even compromised the building's structural logic in that it required many different sized supports</span>

				<span class='text'>The contact with the monuments of the old world had a lasting impact on Niemeyer's views, which he now believed was completely dependent on its aesthetic qualities</span>
				<span class='text'>Together with his own realisations of how Brazilian architecture had been harmed by untalented architects, this trip led Niemeyer to revise his approach, which he published as a text named ''Depoimento'' in his Módulo Magazine</span>
				<span class='text'>He proposed a simplification, discarding multiple elements such as brises, sculptural piloti and marquees</span>
				<span class='text'>His architecture from then on would be a pure expression of structure as a representation of solid volumes</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|300px|Model of the Museum of Modern Art of Caracas]]In 1955, at 48, Niemeyer designed the Museum of Modern Art of Caracas</span>
				<span class='text'>The design of this museum was the material realization of his work revision</span>
				<span class='text'>Meant to rise from the top of a cliff overlooking central [[Caracas]], the museum had an inverted pyramid shape which dominated and overpowered its surroundings</span>
				<span class='text'>The opaque prismatic building had almost no connection to the outside through its walls, although its glass ceiling allowed natural light to enter</span>
				<span class='text'>An electronic system was used to keep lighting conditions unchanged throughout the day using artificial light to complement it</span>
				<span class='text'>The interior, however, was more recognizably done in Niemeyer's mode, with cat-walk ramps linking the different levels and the mezzanine made as a free-form slab hung from ceiling beams</span>
				<span class='text'>his aesthetic simplicity would culminate in his work in Brasília, where the qualities of the buildings are expressed by their structural elements alone</span>

				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;70&lt;/ref&gt;Niemeyer organized a competition for the lay-out of [[Brasília]], the new capital, and the winner was the project of his old master and great friend, [[Lúcio Costa]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Niemeyer would design the buildings, Lucio the layout of the city</span>
				<span class='text'>n the space of a few months, Niemeyer designed residential, commercial and government buildings</span>
				<span class='text'>Among them were the residence of the President (''Palácio da Alvorada''), the chamber of deputies, the [[National Congress of Brazil]], the [[Cathedral of Brasília]] (a [[hyperboloid structure]]), diverse ministries</span>
				<span class='text'>Viewed from above, the city can be seen to have elements that repeat themselves in every building, achieving a formal unity</span>
				<span class='text'>ehind the construction of Brasília lay a monumental campaign to construct an entire city in the barren center of the country, hundreds of kilometers from any major city</span>
				<span class='text'>The brainchild of Kubitschek, Niemeyer had as aims included stimulating industry, integrating the country's distant areas, populating inhospitable regions and bringing progress to a region where only cattle ranching then existed</span>
				<span class='text'>Niemeyer and Costa used it to test new concepts of city planning: streets without transit, buildings floating off the ground supported by columns and allowing the space underneath to be free and integrated with nature</span>
				<span class='text'>he project adopted a socialist ideology: in Brasília all the apartments would be owned by the government and rented to employees</span>
				<span class='text'>Brasília did not have &quot;nobler&quot; regions, meaning that top ministers and common laborers would share the same building</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of these concepts were ignored or changed by other presidents with different visions in later years</span>
				<span class='text'>Brasília was designed, constructed, and inaugurated within four years</span>
				<span class='text'>After its completion, Niemeyer was named chief of the college of architecture of the [[University of Brasília]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1963, he became an honorary member of the [[American Institute of Architects]] in the United States; the same year, he received the [[Lenin Peace Prize]] from the [[USSR]]</span>

				<span class='text'>n 1964, at 57, after being invited by [[Abba Hushi]], the mayor of [[Haifa]], Israel, to plan the campus of the [[University of Haifa]], he came back to a completely different Brazil</span>
