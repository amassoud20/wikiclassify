				<span class='text'>=Biography=====Early life===Born '''Petrus Josephus Wilhelmus Debije'''&lt;ref&gt;For Dutch use of &quot;y&quot; and &quot;ij&quot;, see [[IJ (digraph)]]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Maastricht]], [[Netherlands]], Debye enrolled in the [[Aachen University of Technology]] in 1901, just 30&amp;nbsp;km away from [[Rhenish Prussia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1905, he completed his first degree in [[electrical engineering]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He published his first paper, a mathematically elegant solution of a problem involving [[eddy current]]s, in 1907</span>
				<span class='text'>At Aachen, he studied under the theoretical physicist [[Arnold Sommerfeld]], who later claimed that his most important discovery was Peter Debye</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1906, Sommerfeld received an appointment at [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Munich]], [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]], and took Debye with him as his assistant</span>
				<span class='text'>Debye got his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>] with a dissertation on [[radiation pressure]] in 1908</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1910, he derived the [[Planck's law|Planck radiation formula]] using a method which [[Max Planck]] agreed was simpler than his own</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1911, when [[Albert Einstein]] took an appointment as a professor at [[Charles University of Prague|Prague]], [[Bohemia]], Debye took his old professorship at the [[University of Zurich]], [[Switzerland]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This was followed by moves to [[Utrecht University|Utrecht]] in 1912,&lt;ref&gt;Debye's predecessor in the chair of theoretical physics at Utrecht was Cornelis Wind, who died in 1911</span>
				<span class='text'>Debye's successor at Utrecht was [[Leonard Ornstein]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; to [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]] in 1913, to [[ETH Zurich]] in 1920, to [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]] in 1927, and in 1934 to [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]], where, succeeding Einstein, he became director of the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics]] (now named the Max-Planck-Institut) whose facilities were built only during Debye's era</span>
				<span class='text'>He was awarded the [[Lorentz Medal]] in 1935</span>
				<span class='text'>From 1937 to 1939 he was the president of the [[Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n May 1914 he became member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and in December of the same year he became foreign member</span>

				<span class='text'>They had a son, Peter P</span>
				<span class='text'>Debye (1916-2012), and a daughter, Mathilde Maria (born 1921)</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Scientific contributions===His first major scientific contribution was the application of the concept of [[Electric dipole moment|dipole moment]] to the [[electric charge|charge]] distribution in asymmetric [[molecule]]s in 1912, developing equations relating dipole moments to temperature and [[Relative static permittivity|dielectric constant]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In consequence, the units of molecular dipole moments are termed ''debyes'' in his honor</span>
				<span class='text'>Also in 1912, he extended [[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[Specific heat capacity|specific heat]] to lower temperatures by including contributions from low-frequency [[phonon]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>See [[Debye model]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1913, he extended [[Niels Bohr]]'s theory of [[atomic structure]], introducing elliptical orbits, a concept also introduced by [[Arnold Sommerfeld]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1914–1915, Debye  calculated the effect of temperature on [[X-ray scattering techniques|X-ray diffraction]] patterns of [[crystalline solid]]s with [[Paul Scherrer]] (the &quot;[[Debye–Waller factor]]&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1923, together with his assistant [[Erich Hückel]], he developed an improvement of [[Svante Arrhenius]]' theory of electrical conductivity in [[electrolyte]] solutions</span>
				<span class='text'>Although an improvement was made to the [[Debye–Hückel equation]] in 1926 by [[Lars Onsager]], the theory is still regarded as a major forward step in our understanding of [[Electrolyte|electrolytic]] solutions</span>
				<span class='text'>Also in 1923, Debye developed a theory to explain the [[Compton effect]], the shifting of the frequency of [[X-ray]]s when they interact with [[electron]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>==Later work===From 1934 to 1939 Debye was director of the physics section of the prestigious Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin</span>
				<span class='text'>From 1936 onwards he was also professor of Theoretical Physics at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Frederick William University]] of Berlin</span>
				<span class='text'>These positions were held during the years that [[Adolf Hitler]] ruled [[Nazi Germany]] and, from 1938 onward, [[Austria]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1939 Debye traveled to the [[United States|United States of America]] to deliver the Baker Lectures at [[Cornell University]] in [[Ithaca, New York]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After leaving Germany in early 1940, Debye became a professor at Cornell, chaired the chemistry department for 10 years, and became a member of [[Alpha Chi Sigma]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1946 he became an American citizen</span>
				<span class='text'>Unlike the [[Europe]]an phase of his life, where he moved from city to city every few years, in the United States Debye remained at Cornell for the remainder of his career</span>
				<span class='text'>He retired in 1952, but continued research until his death</span>
				<span class='text'>uch of Debye's work at Cornell concerned the use of light-scattering techniques (derived from his X-ray scattering work of years earlier) to determine the size and [[molecular weight]] of [[polymer]] [[molecule]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>This started as a result of his research during [[World War II]] on [[synthetic rubber]], but was extended to [[protein]]s and other [[macromolecule]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>n April 1966, Debye suffered a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], and in November of that year a second one proved fatal</span>
				<span class='text'>He is buried in the Pleasant Grove Cemetery (Ithaca, New York, USA)</span>

				<span class='text'>Rispens discovered documents that, as he believed, were new and proved that, during his directorship of the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Society]], Debye was actively involved in cleansing German science institutions of Jewish and other &quot;non-Aryan elements&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Rispens records that on December 9, 1938, Debye wrote in his capacity as chairman of the ''Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft'' (DPG) to all the members of the DPG:''In light of the current situation, membership by German Jews as stipulated by the Nuremberg laws, of the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft cannot be continued</span>

				<span class='text'>He planned his departure from Germany during a visit with his mother in [[Maastricht]] in late 1939, boarded a ship in Genoa in January 1940 and arrived in New York in early February 1940</span>
				<span class='text'>He immediately sought a permanent position in the US and accepted such an offer from Cornell in June 1940</span>
				<span class='text'>That month, he crossed the US border into Canada and returned within days on an immigration visa</span>
				<span class='text'>He was able to get his wife out of Germany and to the US by December 1940</span>
				<span class='text'>Although his son already was in the US before he departed, Peter Debye's 19-year-old daughter and his sister-in-law did not leave</span>
				<span class='text'>They lived in his official residence in Berlin and were supported by Debye's official Berlin wages (he carefully maintained an official leave of absence for this purpose)</span>
				<span class='text'>urther, Rispens&lt;ref name=&quot;Rispens&quot; /&gt; alleges that Albert Einstein in the first half of 1940 actively tried to prevent Debye from being appointed in the United States at Cornell</span>
				<span class='text'>Einstein allegedly wrote to his American colleagues: &quot;I know from a reliable source that Peter Debye is still in close contact with the German (Nazi) leaders&quot; and, according to Rispens, called upon his colleagues to do &quot;what they consider their duty as American citizens&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>To support this, Rispens refers to a well-known letter from Debye to Einstein and Einstein's response to it</span>

				<span class='text'>This person was not known personally to Einstein and, according to Einstein, probably did not know Debye personally either</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, this accusatory letter did not reach Einstein directly but was intercepted by British censors who showed it to Einstein</span>
				<span class='text'>Einstein sent the British agent with the letter to Cornell, and the Cornell authorities told Debye about the affair</span>
				<span class='text'>Thereupon Debye wrote his well-known 1940 letter to Einstein to which Einstein answered</span>
				<span class='text'>The latter two letters can be found in the published Einstein correspondence</span>
				<span class='text'>ispens alleges that Debye sent a telegram to Berlin on 23 June 1941 informing his previous employers that he was able and willing to resume his responsibilities at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institut, presumably in order to maintain his leave of absence and keep the Berlin house and wages available for his daughter</span>
				<span class='text'>A copy of this telegram has not been recovered thus far</span>
				<span class='text'>In summer 1941, Debye filed his intent to become a US citizen and was quickly recruited in the US to participate in the Allied War research</span>
				<span class='text'>t has been well documented in many biographies, and also in Rispens' book, that Debye and Dutch colleagues helped his Jewish colleague [[Lise Meitner]] in 1938–1939 (at great risk to himself and his family&lt;ref&gt;Sime, Ruth Lewin</span>

				<span class='text'>Blätter'', 44, Nov 1988, page 418&lt;/ref&gt; appeared 18 years earlier concerning Debye's letter</span>
				<span class='text'>The article describes Debye's missive in more detail and presents a very favorable picture of Debye in his efforts to resist the Nazi activists</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, this article points out that [[Max von Laue]], well known for his anti-Nazi views, gave his approval to the letter from the DPG chairman</span>
				<span class='text'>==International response===Debye's son, Peter P</span>
				<span class='text'>Debye, interviewed in 2006 at age 89&lt;ref&gt;Interview given to Gooi &amp; Eemlander newspaper (Dutch language) on 2 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt; recollects that his father was completely apolitical and that in the privacy of their home politics were never discussed</span>
				<span class='text'>According to his son, Debye just wanted to do his job at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute and as long as the Nazis did not bother him was able to do so</span>
				<span class='text'>He recalls that his mother urged him (the son) to stay in the US in the event of war</span>
				<span class='text'>Debye's son had come to the US on a planned 2-month vacation during the summer of 1939 and never returned to Germany because war did, indeed, break out</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; that the scientific director of the (formerly) Debye Institute had been reprimanded by the Board of Directors of the [[University of Utrecht]] for a new publication on Debye's war years on the grounds that it was too personally biased with respect to the Institute's naming dispute</span>
				<span class='text'>According to the board, the book should have been published not as a Debye Institute publication, but as a personal one</span>
				<span class='text'>The book&lt;ref name=&quot;Ginkel&quot; /&gt; was banned by the University of Utrecht and both Directors of the (former) Debye Institute were forbidden to have any further contact with the press</span>
				<span class='text'>A dozen professors of the Physics Faculty, amongst whom [[Cornelis Dirk Andriesse|Cees Andriesse]], openly protested against the interventions of the Board and the censorship of their protest by the university</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[Volkskrant]], 24 March 2007</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In May 2007, the universities of Utrecht and Maastricht announced that a new committee headed by [[Jan Terlouw]] would advise them regarding the name change</span>
				<span class='text'>Also, in the beginning of 2007 an official report was announced, to be published by the [[NIOD]] and authorized by the Dutch Education Ministry (then scheduled for  fall 2007)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[NRC Handelsblad]], 19 May 2007</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===2007 NIOD report===The report describes Rispens' presentation of Debye, as an opportunist who had no objection to the Nazis, as a caricature</span>
				<span class='text'>'[I]t can be stated that Debye was rightly called an opportunist after his arrival in the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>We have seen that he showed himself to be loyal to the dominant political system, first in the Third Reich and then in the United States, while at the same time keeping the back door open: in the Third Reich by retaining his Dutch nationality, in the United States by attempting to secretly maintain some contacts with Nazi Germany via the Foreign Office</span>
				<span class='text'>'It concludes that Debye's actions in 1933–45 were based on the nineteenth-century positivist view of science which saw research in physics as generating blessings for humankind</span>
				<span class='text'>The report states that, by his contemporaries, Debye was considered an opportunist by some and as a man of highest character by others</span>
				<span class='text'>The report asserts that Debye was not coerced by the Nazis into writing the infamous DPG ''Heil Hitler'' letter and that he also did not follow the lead of other societies in doing so but, rather, other societies followed his lead</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Note that this statement is in sharp contrast to the conclusion reached in a previous study of the DPG's relationship to the Third Reich which describes the DPG to be one of the last professional organizations in Germany to expel its Jewish members</span>

				<span class='text'>Max Planck Institute for the History of Science&lt;/ref&gt; The NIOD report also concludes that Debye felt obliged to send the letter and that it was, for him, simply a confirmation of an existing situation</span>
				<span class='text'>The report argues that Debye, in the Third Reich, developed a survival method of ambiguity which allowed him to pursue his scientific career despite the political turmoil</span>
				<span class='text'>Crucial to this survival method was the need to keep ready an escape hatch, for example in his secret dealings with the Nazis in 1941, if needed</span>
				<span class='text'>et, the report also states that the picture of Debye should not be oversimplified as Debye's actions were also motivated by his loyalty to his daughter, who had remained in Berlin</span>
				<span class='text'>In general, Debye developed a survival method of ambiguity, that &quot;could pull the wool over people's eyes&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===2008 Terlouw report===In January 2008 the Terlouw Commission advised ''the Boards of Utrecht and Maastricht Universities to continue to use Peter Debye’s name for the chemistry and physics institute in Utrecht, and to continue awarding the science prize in Maastricht''</span>

				<span class='text'>Press release University of Utrecht</span>
				<span class='text'>17 January 2008</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The Commission concluded that Debye was not a party member, was not an anti-semite, did not further Nazi propaganda, did not cooperate with the Nazi war machine, was not a [[Collaborationism|collaborator]], and yet also was not a resistance hero</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a rather pragmatic, flexible, and brilliant scientist, idealistic with respect to the pursuit of science, but only superficially oriented in politics</span>
				<span class='text'>With respect to sending out the DPG letter, the Commission  concluded that Debye found the situation inescapable</span>
				<span class='text'>The Commission pointed out that the Royal Dutch Academy of Sciences also took away Albert Einstein's honorary membership, emphasizing  the circumstances in which these decisions had been taken</span>
				<span class='text'>The Commission stated that now, seventy years later, no judgment can be made concerning the decision of Debye to sign this letter in the exceptionally difficult circumstances in which he then found himself</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, the Commission describes the DPG letter as an extraordinarily unpleasant fact, forming a dark page in his life history</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally, the Commission concluded that based on the NIOD report ''since no bad faith on Debye’s part has been demonstrated, his good faith must be assumed'' and recommended that the University of Utrecht retain the name of the Debye Institute of NanoMaterials Science and that the University of Maastricht continue to associate itself with the Peter Debye Prize</span>
				<span class='text'>Utrecht University accepted the recommendation, Maastricht University did not</span>
				<span class='text'>But in February 2008, the Hustinx Foundation (Maastricht), originator and sponsor of the Peter Debye Prize, announced that it will continue to have the prize awarded</span>
				<span class='text'>The City of Maastricht, Debye's birthplace, declared that it sees no reason to change the names of Debye Street and Debye Square</span>
				<span class='text'>==Debye the spy===In a 2010 publication Jurrie Reiding asserts that Debye may have been an [[MI6]] spy</span>

				<span class='text'>They first met around 1930 when they were both working as editors for two scientific journals</span>
				<span class='text'>They collaborated in the escape of Lise Meitner in 1938</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Reiding, Debye was well connected in German scientific and industrial circles and could have provided MI6 with valuable information</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, as board member of the German Academy for Aviation Research he was acquainted with [[Hermann Göring]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Reiding also offers an explanation for Debye's hasty departure on 16 January 1940 for the United States: the date coincided with the planned (but later delayed) [[German invasion of the Netherlands]] a day later, information possibly passed on to him by Rosbaud</span>
