				<span class='text'>lovis was the son of [[Childeric I]], a [[Merovingian]] king of the [[Salian Franks]], and [[Basina, Queen of Thuringia]], and he succeeded his father in 481, at the age of fifteen</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;The date 481 is arrived at by counting back from the Battle of Tolbiac, which [[Gregory of Tours]] places in the fifteenth year of Clovis's reign</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He conquered the remaining [[Domain of Soissons|rump state]] of the [[Western Roman Empire]] at the [[Battle of Soissons (486)]], and by his death in 511 he had conquered much of the northern and western parts of what had formerly been [[Roman Gaul]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lovis is important in the historiography of [[France]] as &quot;the first king of what would become France&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;General [[Charles de Gaulle]] is cited (in the biography by David Schœnbrun, 1965), as having said &quot;For me, the history of France begins with Clovis, elected as king of France by the tribe of the Franks, who gave their name to France</span>
				<span class='text'>Before Clovis, we have Gallo-Roman and Gaulish prehistory</span>
				<span class='text'>The decisive element, for me, is that Clovis was the first king to have been baptized a Christian</span>
				<span class='text'>My country is a Christian country and I reckon the history of France beginning with the accession of a Christian king who bore the name of the Franks</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; (''Pour moi, l'histoire de France commence avec Clovis, choisi comme roi de France par la tribu des Francs, qui donnèrent leur nom à la France</span>

				<span class='text'>')&lt;/ref&gt; His name is [[Germanic name|Germanic]], composed of the elements ''hlod'' (&quot;fame&quot;) and ''wig'' (&quot;combat&quot;), and is the origin of the later French given name ''[[Louis (given name)|Louis]]'', borne by 18 [[kings of France]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Dutch language|Dutch]], the most closely related modern language to [[Frankish language|Frankish]], reborrowed the name as ''[[Lodewijk]]'' from German in the 12th century</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Clovis is also extremely significant due to his conversion to [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] in 496, largely at the behest of his wife, [[Clotilde]], who would later be venerated as a saint for this act</span>
				<span class='text'>The adoption of [[Nicene]] orthodoxy (as opposed to the [[Arianism]] of some other Germanic tribes) by Clovis led to widespread conversion among the Frankish peoples, religious unification across modern-day France and Germany, and [[Charlemagne]]'s alliance with the pope and the consequent birth of the early [[Holy Roman Empire]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Frankish consolidation==Numerous small Frankish kingdoms existed during the 5th century</span>
				<span class='text'>The Salian Franks were one of two Frankish tribes that occupied the area west of the lower [[Rhine]] known as [[Toxandria]], between the [[Meuse River|Meuse]] and [[Scheldt]] (in what is now the Netherlands and Belgium)</span>
				<span class='text'>Their power base began to the southwest around [[Tournai]], capital of the kingdom, along the modern frontier between France and Belgium</span>
				<span class='text'>hilderic I, Clovis' father, became king of the Salian Franks in 457 upon the death of his father, [[Merovech]], ruling over lands he had received as a ''[[Foederati|foederatus]]'' of the [[Roman Empire|Romans]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 463 he fought in conjunction with [[Aegidius]], the [[magister militum]] of northern Gaul, to defeat the [[Visigoths]] in [[Orléans]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Childeric died in 482 and was buried in Tournai; Clovis succeeded him as king</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Conquests of Clovis</span>
				<span class='text'>ng|thumb|left|Conquests of Clovis between 481 and 511]]Under Clovis, the Salian Franks came to dominate their neighbours, initially aided by the association with Aegidius</span>
				<span class='text'>Historians believe that Childeric and Clovis were both commanders of the Roman military in the Province of [[Belgica Secunda]] and were subordinate to the magister militum</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenwein|first=Barbara|title=A Short History of the Middle Ages|year=2004|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Canada|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clovis turned against the Roman commanders, however, defeating the [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Roman]] ruler, and son of Aegidus, [[Syagrius]] in the [[Battle of Soissons (486)]], considered the end of Western Roman rule outside of Italy</span>

				<span class='text'>126&lt;/ref&gt;  Clovis then had the Frankish king [[Chararic (Frankish king)|Chararic]] imprisoned and executed</span>
				<span class='text'>A few years later, he killed [[Ragnachar]], the Frankish king of Cambrai, along with his brothers</span>
				<span class='text'>Another victory followed in 491 over a small group of [[Thuringia]]ns to the east</span>
				<span class='text'> By this time Clovis had conquered all the Frankish kingdoms to the west of the River Maas, except for the [[Ripuarian Franks]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He secured an alliance with the [[Ostrogoths]] through the marriage of his sister [[Audofleda]] to their king, [[Theodoric the Great]]</span>
				<span class='text'>With the help of the other Frankish sub-kings, he narrowly defeated the [[Alamanni]] in the [[Battle of Tolbiac]] in 496</span>
				<span class='text'>He made Paris his capital&lt;ref name=BeerAdvocate/&gt; and established an abbey dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul on the south bank of the [[Seine]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;The abbey was later renamed [[Sainte-Geneviève Abbey]], in honor of the [[patron saint]] of Paris, and was demolished in 1802</span>
				<span class='text'>All that remains is the &quot;Tour Clovis&quot;, a Romanesque tower which now lies within the grounds of the [[Lycée Henri-IV]], just east of [[The Panthéon]], and the parish Saint-Étienne-du-Mont, which was built on the abbey territory</span>

				<span class='text'>He gained the support of the Armoricans (Alans, Gallo Romans, Britons) in the following years, for they assisted him in defeating the [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] kingdom of [[Toulouse]] in the [[Battle of Vouillé]] in 507, eliminating Visigothic power in Gaul</span>

				<span class='text'>While the theology of the Arians was declared a heresy at the [[First Council of Nicea]] in 325 AD, the missionary work of the bishop [[Ulfilas]] converted the [[Germanic paganism|pagan]] Goths to Arian Christianity in the 4th century</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Tomb of Clovis I at the [[Basilica of St Denis]] in [[Saint-Denis (Seine-Saint-Denis)|Saint Denis]]]]Shortly before his death, Clovis called a synod of Gallic bishops to meet in [[Orléans]] to reform the Church and create a strong link between the Crown and the Catholic episcopate</span>
				<span class='text'>This was the [[First Council of Orléans]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Thirty-three bishops assisted and passed 31 decrees on the duties and obligations of individuals, the right of sanctuary, and ecclesiastical discipline</span>

				<span class='text'>This partition created the new political units of the Kingdoms of [[Rheims]], [[Orléans]], Paris and [[Soissons]], and inaugurated a tradition that would lead to disunity lasting until the end of the [[Merovingians|Merovingian]] dynasty in 751</span>
				<span class='text'>The disunity continued under the [[Carolingians]] until, after a brief unity under [[Charlemagne]], the Franks splintered into distinct spheres of cultural influence that coalesced around Eastern and Western centers of royal power</span>
