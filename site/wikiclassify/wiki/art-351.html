				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; was the [[King of Aquitaine]] from 781</span>
				<span class='text'>He was also [[King of the Franks]] and [[Holy Roman Emperor|co-Emperor]] (as '''Louis I''') with his father, [[Charlemagne]], of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] from 813</span>
				<span class='text'>s the only surviving adult son of [[Charlemagne]] and [[Hildegard, wife of Charlemagne|Hildegard]], he became the sole ruler of the Franks after his father's death in 814, a position which he held until his death, save for the period 833–34, during which he was deposed</span>
				<span class='text'>uring his reign in Aquitaine, Louis was charged with the defence of the Empire's southwestern frontier</span>
				<span class='text'>He [[History of Barcelona#Barcelona in the Spanish March|conquered Barcelona]] from the [[Muslims]] in 801 and asserted Frankish authority over [[Pamplona]] and the [[Basques]] south of the [[Pyrenees]] in 812</span>
				<span class='text'>As emperor he included his adult sons, [[Lothair I|Lothair]], [[Pepin I of Aquitaine|Pepin]], and [[Louis the German|Louis]], in the government and sought to establish a suitable division of the realm among them</span>
				<span class='text'>The first decade of his reign was characterised by several tragedies and embarrassments, notably the brutal treatment of his nephew [[Bernard of Italy]], for which Louis atoned in a public act of self-debasement</span>
				<span class='text'>n the 830s his empire was torn by civil war between his sons, only exacerbated by Louis's attempts to include his son [[Charles the Bald|Charles]] by his second wife in the succession plans</span>
				<span class='text'>Though his reign ended on a high note, with order largely restored to his empire, it was followed by three years of civil war</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis is generally compared unfavourably to his father, though the problems he faced were of a distinctly different sort</span>
				<span class='text'>=Birth and rule in Aquitaine==Louis was born while his father [[Charlemagne]] was on campaign in Spain, at the Carolingian [[Roman villa|villa]] of [[Chasseneuil-du-Poitou|Cassinogilum]], according to [[Einhard]] and the anonymous chronicler called [[Astronomus]]; the place is usually identified with [[Chasseneuil-du-Poitou|Chasseneuil]], near Poitiers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Einhard gives the name of his birthplace as ''Cassanoilum''</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition to Chasseneuil near Poitiers, scholars have suggested that Louis may have been born at Casseneuil (Lot et Garonne) or at Casseuil on the [[Garonne]] near La Réole, where the Dropt flows into the Garonne</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He was the third son of Charlemagne by his wife [[Hildegard, wife of Charlemagne|Hildegard]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His grandfather was [[Pepin the Short]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ouis was crowned [[King of Aquitaine]] as a child in 781&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Riche, ''The Carolingians:The Family who Forged Europe'', transl</span>
				<span class='text'>Michael Idomir Allen, (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1993), 116</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and sent there with [[regent]]s and a court</span>
				<span class='text'>Charlemagne constituted the sub-kingdom in order to secure the border of his kingdom after the destructive war against the Aquitanians and Basques under [[Waifer of Aquitaine|Waifer]] (capitulated ''c''</span>
				<span class='text'>768) and later [[Hunald II]], which culminated in the disastrous [[Battle of Roncesvalles]] (778)</span>
				<span class='text'>Charlemagne wanted his son Louis to grow up in the area where he was to reign</span>
				<span class='text'>However, in 785, wary of the customs his son may have been taking in Aquitaine, Charlemagne sent for him to Aquitaine and Louis presented himself at the Royal [[Council of Paderborn]] dressed up in Basque costumes along with other youths in the same garment, which may have made a good impression in Toulouse, since the Basques of [[Duchy of Vasconia|Vasconia]] were a mainstay of the Aquitanian army</span>
				<span class='text'>n 794, Charlemagne settled four former [[Gallo-Roman]] villas on Louis, in the thought that he would take in each in turn as winter residence: [[Doué-la-Fontaine]] in today's [[Anjou]], [[Ebreuil]] in Allier, [[Angeac-Charente]], and the disputed Cassinogilum</span>
				<span class='text'>Charlemagne's intention was to see all his sons brought up as natives of their given territories, wearing the national costume of the region and ruling by the local customs</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus were the children sent to their respective realms at so young an age</span>
				<span class='text'>Each kingdom had its importance in keeping some frontier, Louis's was the [[Spanish March]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 797, [[Barcelona]], the greatest city of the ''Marca'', fell to the Franks when Zeid, its governor, rebelled against [[Córdoba (Spain)|Córdoba]] and, failing, handed it to them</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Umayyad]] authority recaptured it in 799</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Louis marched the entire army of his kingdom, including [[Gascons]] with their duke [[Sancho I of Gascony]], [[Provence|Provençals]] under [[Leibulf of Provence|Leibulf]], and [[Visigoths|Goths]] under [[Bera, Count of Barcelona|Bera]], over the [[Pyrenees]] and besieged it for two years, wintering there from 800 to 801, when it capitulated</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pierre Riche, ''The Carolingians:The Family who Forged Europe'', 94</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The sons were not given independence from central authority, however, and Charlemagne ingrained in them the concepts of empire and unity by sending them on military expeditions far from their home bases</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis campaigned in the Italian [[Mezzogiorno]] against the [[Duchy of Benevento|Beneventans]] at least once</span>
				<span class='text'>ouis was one of Charlemagne's three legitimate sons to survive infancy, including his twin brother, Lothair</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Frankish custom, Louis had expected to share his inheritance with his brothers, [[Charles the Younger, son of Charlemagne|Charles the Younger]], [[King of Neustria]], and [[Pepin of Italy|Pepin]], [[King of Italy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In the ''Divisio Regnorum'' of 806, Charlemagne had slated Charles the Younger as his successor as emperor and chief king, ruling over the Frankish heartland of [[Neustria]] and [[Austrasia]], while giving Pepin the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]], which Charlemagne possessed by conquest</span>
				<span class='text'>To Louis's kingdom of Aquitaine, he added [[Septimania]], Provence, and part of [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ut in the event, Charlemagne's other legitimate sons died – Pepin in 810 and Charles in 811 – and Louis alone remained to be crowned co-emperor with Charlemagne in 813</span>
				<span class='text'>On his father's death in 814, he inherited the entire Frankish kingdom and all its possessions (with the sole exception of Italy, which remained within Louis's empire, but under the direct rule of [[Bernard of Italy|Bernard]], Pepin's son)</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Driscoll194&quot; /&gt;From start of his reign, his coinage imitated his father Charlemagne's portrait, which gave it an image of imperial authority and prestige</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Driscoll194&quot; /&gt; Sparing his illegitimate half-brothers, he forced his father's cousins, [[Adalard of Corbie|Adalard]] and [[Wala of Corbie|Wala]] to be [[Tonsure#History|tonsured]], placing them in [[Noirmoutier]] and [[Corbie]], respectively, despite the latter's initial loyalty</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;His chief counsellors were [[Bernard of Septimania|Bernard, margrave of Septimania]], and [[Ebbo]], [[Archbishop of Reims]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The latter, born a serf, was raised by Louis to that office, but betrayed him later</span>
				<span class='text'>He retained some of his father's ministers, such as [[Elisachar]], abbot of St</span>
				<span class='text'>Maximin near [[Trier]], and [[Hildebold]], [[Archbishop of Cologne]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Later he replaced Elisachar with [[Hilduin|Hildwin]], abbot of many monasteries</span>
				<span class='text'>e also employed [[Benedict of Aniane]] (the Second Benedict), a Septimanian [[Visigoths|Visigoth]] and monastic founder, to help him reform the Frankish church</span>
				<span class='text'>One of Benedict's primary reforms was to ensure that all religious houses in Louis' realm adhered to the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]], named for its creator, [[Benedict of Nursia]] (480–550), the First Benedict</span>
				<span class='text'>n 816, [[Pope Stephen IV]], who had succeeded [[Pope Leo III|Leo III]], visited [[Reims]] and again crowned Louis</span>
				<span class='text'>The Emperor thereby strengthened the papacy by recognising the importance of the pope in imperial coronations</span>
				<span class='text'>[Image:Denier Louis le Pieux</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|''[[Denarius]]'' of Louis</span>
				<span class='text'>]===''Ordinatio imperii''===On [[Maundy Thursday]] 817, Louis and his court were crossing a wooden gallery from the cathedral to the palace in Aachen when the gallery collapsed, killing many</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis, having barely survived and feeling the imminent danger of death, began planning for his succession; three months later he issued an ''Ordinatio Imperii'', an imperial decree that laid out plans for an orderly succession</span>
				<span class='text'>In 815, he had already given his two eldest sons a share in the government, when he had sent his elder sons [[Lothair I|Lothair]] and [[Pepin I of Aquitaine|Pepin]] to govern [[Bavaria]] and Aquitaine respectively, though without the royal titles</span>
				<span class='text'>Now, he proceeded to divide the empire among his three sons:* Lothair was proclaimed and crowned co-emperor in Aachen by his father</span>
				<span class='text'>He was promised the succession to most of the Frankish dominions (excluding the exceptions below), and would be the overlord of his brothers and cousin</span>
				<span class='text'> Pepin was proclaimed King of Aquitaine, his territory including Gascony, the march around Toulouse, and the counties of Carcassonne, Autun, Avallon and Nevers</span>
				<span class='text'> [[Louis the German|Louis]], the youngest son, was proclaimed King of Bavaria and the neighbouring marches</span>
				<span class='text'>f one of the subordinate kings died, he was to be succeeded by his sons</span>
				<span class='text'>If he died childless, Lothair would inherit his kingdom</span>
				<span class='text'>In the event of Lothair dying without sons, one of Louis the Pious' younger sons would be chosen to replace him by &quot;the people&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Above all, the Empire would not be divided: the Emperor would rule supreme over the subordinate kings, whose obedience to him was mandatory</span>
				<span class='text'>ith this settlement, Louis tried to combine his sense for the Empire's unity, supported by the clergy, while at the same time providing positions for all of his sons</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead of treating his sons equally in status and land, he elevated his first-born son Lothair above his younger brothers and gave him the largest part of the Empire as his share</span>
				<span class='text'>[Image:Louis the Pious</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Louis the Pious doing penance at Attigny in 822]]===Bernard's rebellion and Louis's penance===The ''ordinatio imperii'' of Aachen left Bernard of Italy in an uncertain and subordinate position as king of Italy, and he began plotting to declare independence upon hearing of it</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis immediately directed his army towards Italy, and betook himself to [[Chalon-sur-Saône]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Intimidated by the emperor's swift action, Bernard met his uncle at Chalon, under invitation, and surrendered</span>
				<span class='text'>He was taken to Aachen by Louis, who there had him tried and condemned to death for treason</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis had the sentence commuted to blinding, which was duly carried out; Bernard did not survive the ordeal, however, dying after two days of agony</span>
				<span class='text'>Others also suffered: [[Theodulf of Orléans]], in eclipse since the death of Charlemagne, was accused of having supported the rebellion, and was thrown into a monastic prison, but he died soon after – poisoned, it was rumoured</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''The Frankish Kingdoms, 814-898:the West'', Janet L</span>
				<span class='text'>Nelson, '''The New Cambridge Medieval History, 700–900''', Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>II, ed</span>
				<span class='text'>Rosamond McKitterick, (Cambridge University Press, 1995), 114</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The fate of his nephew deeply marked Louis's conscience for the rest of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>n 822, as a deeply religious man, Louis performed penance for causing Bernard's death, at his palace of [[Attigny, Ardennes|Attigny]] near Vouziers in the [[Ardennes]], before [[Pope Paschal I]], and a council of ecclesiastics and nobles of the realm that had been convened for the reconciliation of Louis with his three younger half-brothers, [[Hugh, son of Charlemagne|Hugo]] whom he soon made abbot of St-Quentin, [[Drogo of Metz|Drogo]] whom he soon made [[Bishop of Metz]], and Theodoric</span>
				<span class='text'>This act of contrition, partly in emulation of [[Theodosius I]], had the effect of greatly reducing his prestige as a Frankish ruler, for he also recited a list of minor offences about which no secular ruler of the time would have taken any notice</span>
				<span class='text'>He also made the egregious error of releasing Wala and Adalard from their monastic confinements, placing the former in a position of power in the court of Lothair and the latter in a position in his own house</span>
				<span class='text'>[Image:Louis le Pieu denier Sens 818 823</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|left|thumb|Louis on a ''[[denarius]]'' from [[Sens]], 818–823]]===Frontier wars===At the start of Louis's reign, the many tribes – [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]], [[Obotrites]], [[Slovenes]], [[Bretons]], [[Basques]] – which inhabited his frontierlands were still in awe of the Frankish emperor's power and dared not stir up any trouble</span>
				<span class='text'>In 816, however, the [[Sorbs]] rebelled and were quickly followed by Slavomir, chief of the Obotrites, who was captured and abandoned by his own people, being replaced by Ceadrag in 818</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon, Ceadrag too had turned against the Franks and allied with the Danes, who were to become the greatest menace of the Franks in a short time</span>
				<span class='text'> greater Slavic menace was gathering on the southeast</span>
				<span class='text'>There, [[Liudewit]], duke of [[Pannonia]], was harassing the border at the [[Drava]] and [[Sava]] rivers</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[margrave of Friuli]], [[Cadolah]], was sent out against him, but he died on campaign and, in 820, his margarvate was invaded by Slovenes</span>
				<span class='text'>In 821, an alliance was made with [[Borna of Croatia|Borna]], duke of the [[Dalmatia]], and Liudewit was brought to heel</span>
				<span class='text'>In 824 several Slav tribes in the north-western parts of [[Bulgaria]] acknowledged Louis's suzerainty and after he was reluctant to settle the matter peacefully with the Bulgarian ruler [[Omurtag of Bulgaria|Omurtag]], in 827 the Bulgarians attacked the Franks in [[Pannonia]] and regained their lands</span>
				<span class='text'>n the far southern edge of his great realm, Louis had to control the Lombard [[list of Dukes and Princes of Benevento|princes of Benevento]] whom Charlemagne had never subjugated</span>
				<span class='text'>He extracted promises from Princes [[Grimoald IV of Benevento|Grimoald IV]] and [[Sicone of Benevento|Sico]], but to no effect</span>
				<span class='text'>n the southwestern frontier, problems commenced early when c</span>
				<span class='text'>812, Louis the Pious crossed the western Pyrenees 'to settle matters' in Pamplona</span>
				<span class='text'>The expedition made its way back north, where it narrowly escaped an ambush attempt arranged by the [[History of the Basque people#Early Middle Ages|Basques]] in the pass of Roncevaux thanks to the precautions he took, i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>hostages</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Semen Lop of Gascony|Séguin]], duke of [[Duchy of Vasconia|Gascony]], was then deposed by Louis in 816, possibly for failing to suppress or collaborating with the Basque revolt south of the western Pyrenees, so sparking off a Basque uprising that was duly put down by the Frankish emperor in Dax</span>
				<span class='text'>Seguin was replaced by [[Lop III Centullo of Gascony|Lupus III]], who was dispossessed in 818 by the emperor</span>
				<span class='text'>In 820 an assembly at [[Quierzy-sur-Oise]] decided to send an expedition against the Cordoban caliphate (827)</span>
				<span class='text'>The counts in charge of the army, [[Hugh of Tours|Hugh]], count of [[Tours]], and [[Matfrid of Orléans|Matfrid]], count of [[Orléans]], were slow in acting and the expedition came to naught</span>
				<span class='text'>==First civil war===In 818, as Louis was returning from a campaign to [[Brittany]], he was greeted by news of the death of his wife, [[Ermengarde of Hesbaye|Ermengarde]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Ermengarde was the daughter of [[Ingerman, Count of Hesbania|Ingerman]], the duke of Hesbaye</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis had been close to his wife, who had been involved in policymaking</span>
				<span class='text'>It was rumoured that she had played a part in her nephew's death and Louis himself believed her own death was divine retribution for that event</span>
				<span class='text'>It took many months for his courtiers and advisors to convince him to remarry, but eventually he did, in 820, to [[Judith, daughter of Welf|Judith]], daughter of [[Welf (father of Judith)|Welf]], count of [[Altdorf (Weingarten)|Altdorf]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 823 Judith gave birth to a son, who was named [[Charles the Bald|Charles]]</span>
				<span class='text'>he birth of this son damaged the ''Partition of Aachen'', as Louis's attempts to provide for his fourth son met with stiff resistance from his older sons, and the last two decades of his reign were marked by civil war</span>
				<span class='text'>t [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] in 829, Louis gave Charles [[Alemannia]] with the title of king or duke (historians differ on this), thus enraging his son and co-emperor Lothair,&lt;ref&gt;Paired gold medallions of father and son had been struck on the occasion of the synod of Paris (825) that asserted Frankish claims as emperor, recently denigrated by the Byzantines; see Karl F</span>
				<span class='text'>Morrison, &quot;The Gold Medallions of Louis the Pious and Lothaire I and the Synod of Paris (825)&quot; ''Speculum'' '''36'''</span>
				<span class='text'> (October 1961:592–599)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; whose promised share was thereby diminished</span>
				<span class='text'>An insurrection was soon at hand</span>
				<span class='text'>ith the urging of the vengeful Wala and the cooperation of his brothers, Lothair accused Judith of having committed adultery with Bernard of Septimania, even suggesting Bernard to be the true father of Charles</span>
				<span class='text'>Ebbo and Hildwin abandoned the emperor at that point, Bernard having risen to greater heights than either of them</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Agobard]], [[Archbishop of Lyon]], and [[Jesse of Amiens|Jesse]], [[bishop of Amiens]], too, opposed the redivision of the empire and lent their episcopal prestige to the rebels</span>
				<span class='text'>n 830, at Wala's insistence that Bernard of Septimania was plotting against him, Pepin of Aquitaine led an army of [[Gascony|Gascon]]s, with the support of the Neustrian magnates, all the way to Paris</span>
				<span class='text'>At [[Verberie]], Louis the German joined him</span>
				<span class='text'>At that time, the emperor returned from another campaign in Brittany to find his empire at war with itself</span>
				<span class='text'>He marched as far as [[Compiègne]], an ancient royal town, before being surrounded by Pepin's forces and captured</span>
				<span class='text'>Judith was incarcerated at [[Poitiers]] and Bernard fled to Barcelona</span>
				<span class='text'>hen Lothair finally set out with a large Lombard army, but Louis had promised his sons Louis the German and Pepin of Aquitaine greater shares of the inheritance, prompting them to shift loyalties in favour of their father</span>
				<span class='text'>When Lothair tried to call a general council of the realm in [[Nijmegen]], in the heart of [[Austrasia]], the Austrasians and Rhinelanders came with a following of armed retainers, and the disloyal sons were forced to free their father and bow at his feet (831)</span>
				<span class='text'>Lothair was pardoned, but disgraced and banished to Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>epin returned to Aquitaine and Judith – after being forced to humiliate herself with a solemn oath of innocence – to Louis's court</span>
				<span class='text'>Only Wala was severely dealt with, making his way to a secluded monastery on the shores of [[Lake Geneva]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Although [[Hilduin]], abbot of [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint Denis]], was exiled to [[Paderborn]] and Elisachar and Matfrid were deprived of their honours north of the Alps; they did not lose their freedom</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=June 2015}}===Second civil war===The next revolt occurred a mere two years later (832)</span>
				<span class='text'>The disaffected Pepin was summoned to his father's court, where he was so poorly received he left against his father's orders</span>
				<span class='text'>Immediately, fearing that Pepin would be stirred up to revolt by his nobles and desiring to reform his morals, Louis the Pious summoned all his forces to meet in Aquitaine in preparation of an uprising, but Louis the German garnered an army of [[Slavic peoples|Slav]] allies and conquered [[Swabia]] before the emperor could react</span>
				<span class='text'>Once again the elder Louis divided his vast realm</span>
				<span class='text'>At [[Jonac]], he declared Charles king of Aquitaine and deprived Pepin (he was less harsh with the younger Louis), restoring the whole rest of the empire to Lothair, not yet involved in the civil war</span>
				<span class='text'>Lothair was, however, interested in usurping his father's authority</span>
				<span class='text'>His ministers had been in contact with Pepin and may have convinced him and Louis the German to rebel, promising him Alemannia, the kingdom of Charles</span>
				<span class='text'>oon Lothair, with the support of [[Pope Gregory IV]], whom he had confirmed in office without his father's support, joined the revolt in 833</span>
				<span class='text'>While Louis was at Worms gathering a new force, Lothair marched north</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis marched south</span>
				<span class='text'>The armies met on the plains of the Rothfeld</span>
				<span class='text'>There, Gregory met the emperor and may have tried to sow dissension amongst his ranks</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon much of Louis's army had evaporated before his eyes, and he ordered his few remaining followers to go, because &quot;it would be a pity if any man lost his life or limb on my account</span>

				<span class='text'>In return, Lothair gave Ebbo the Abbey of Saint Vaast</span>
				<span class='text'>Men like [[Rabanus Maurus]], Louis' younger half-brothers Drogo and Hugh, and Emma, Judith's sister and Louis the German's new wife, worked on the younger Louis to make peace with his father, for the sake of unity of the empire</span>
				<span class='text'>The humiliation to which Louis was then subjected at Notre Dame in Compiègne turned the loyal barons of Austrasia and [[Saxony]] against Lothair, and the usurper fled to [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], skirmishing with loyalists near [[Chalon-sur-Saône]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis was restored the next year, on 1 March 834</span>
				<span class='text'>n Lothair's return to Italy, Wala, Jesse, and Matfrid, ''formerly'' count of Orléans, died of a pestilence and, on 2 February 835, the [[Synod of Thionville]] deposed Ebbo, Agobard, [[Bernard, Bishop of Vienne]], and [[Bartholomew, Archbishop of Narbonne]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Lothair himself fell ill; events had turned completely in Louis favour once again</span>
				<span class='text'>n 836, however, the family made peace and Louis restored Pepin and Louis, deprived Lothair of all save Italy, and gave it to Charles in a new division, given at the diet of [[Crémieu]]</span>
				<span class='text'>At about that time, the [[Vikings]] terrorised and sacked [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] and [[Antwerp]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 837, they went up the [[Rhine]] as far as Nijmegen, and their king, [[Rorik, Danish viking leader|Rorik]], demanded the [[wergild]] of some of his followers killed on previous expeditions before Louis the Pious mustered a massive force and marched against them</span>
				<span class='text'>They fled, but it would not be the last time they harried the northern coasts</span>
				<span class='text'>In 838, they even claimed sovereignty over [[Frisia]], but a treaty was confirmed between them and the Franks in 839</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis the Pious ordered the construction of a North Sea fleet and the sending of ''[[missus dominicus|missi dominici]]'' into Frisia to establish Frankish sovereignty there</span>
				<span class='text'>==Third civil war===In 837, Louis crowned Charles king over all of Alemannia and Burgundy and gave him a portion of his brother Louis' land</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis the German promptly rose in revolt, and the emperor redivided his realm again at [[Quierzy-sur-Oise]], giving all of the young king of Bavaria's lands, save Bavaria itself, to Charles</span>
				<span class='text'>Emperor Louis did not stop there, however</span>
				<span class='text'>His devotion to Charles knew no bounds</span>
				<span class='text'>When Pepin died in 838, Louis declared Charles the new king of Aquitaine</span>
				<span class='text'>The nobles, however, elected Pepin's son [[Pepin II of Aquitaine|Pepin II]]</span>
				<span class='text'>When Louis threatened invasion, the third great civil war of his reign broke out</span>
				<span class='text'>In the spring of 839, Louis the German invaded Swabia, Pepin II and his Gascon subjects fought all the way to the [[Loire]], and the Danes returned to ravage the [[Frisia]]n coast (sacking [[Dorestad]] for a second time)</span>
				<span class='text'>othair, for the first time in a long time, allied with his father and pledged support at Worms in exchange for a redivision of the inheritance</span>
				<span class='text'>At a final ''[[placitum]]'' held there, Louis gave Bavaria to Louis the German and disinherited Pepin II, leaving the entire remainder of the empire to be divided roughly into an eastern part and a western</span>
				<span class='text'>Lothair was given the choice of which partition he would inherit and he chose the eastern, including Italy, leaving the western for Charles</span>
				<span class='text'>The emperor quickly subjugated Aquitaine and had Charles recognised by the nobles and clergy at [[Clermont-Ferrand|Clermont-en-Auvergne]] in 840</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis then, in a final flash of glory, rushed into Bavaria and forced the younger Louis into the [[March of Pannonia|Ostmark]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The empire now settled as he had declared it at Worms, he returned in July to [[Frankfurt am Main]], where he disbanded the army</span>
				<span class='text'>The final civil war of his reign was over</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=June 2015}}===Death===Louis fell ill soon after his final victorious campaigns and went to his summer hunting lodge on an island in the Rhine, by his [[Imperial Palace Ingelheim|palace at Ingelheim]]</span>
				<span class='text'>On 20 June 840, he died, in the presence of many bishops and clerics and in the arms of his half-brother Drogo, though Charles and Judith were absent in Poitiers</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon dispute plunged the surviving brothers into a civil war that was only settled in 843 by the [[Treaty of Verdun]], which split the Frankish realm into three parts, to become the kernels of France and Germany, with [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] and the [[Low Countries]] between them</span>
				<span class='text'>The dispute over the kingship of Aquitaine was not fully settled until 860</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=June 2015}}Louis was buried in the [[Abbey of Saint-Arnould]] in [[Metz]]</span>
