				<span class='text'>1662–65)]]Vermeer may have first executed his paintings tonally like most painters of his time, using either monochrome shades of grey (&quot;[[grisaille]]&quot;) or a limited palette of browns and greys (&quot;dead coloring&quot;), over which he would apply more saturated colors (reds, yellows and blues) in the form of transparent glazes</span>
				<span class='text'>No drawings have been positively attributed to Vermeer, and his paintings offer few clues to preparatory methods</span>
				<span class='text'>here is no other 17th-century artist who employed the exorbitantly expensive pigments [[lapis lazuli]] or natural [[ultramarine]] either so lavishly or so early in his career</span>
				<span class='text'>Vermeer not only used this in elements that are naturally of this colour; the earth colours [[umber]] and [[ochre]] should be understood as warm light within a painting's strongly-lit interior, which reflects its multiple colours onto the wall</span>
				<span class='text'>In this way, he created a world more perfect than any he had witnessed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=p867 group=Liedtke/&gt; This working method most probably was inspired by Vermeer’s understanding of [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo’s]] observations that the surface of every object partakes of the colour of the adjacent object</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=wadum95/&gt; This means that no object is ever seen entirely in its natural colour</span>
				<span class='text'> comparable but even more remarkable, yet effectual, use of natural ultramarine is in ''The Girl with a Wineglass''</span>

				<span class='text'>ven after Vermeer’s supposed financial breakdown following the so-called [[rampjaar]] (year of disaster) in 1672, he continued to employ natural ultramarine generously, such as in ''Lady Seated at a Virginal''</span>
				<span class='text'>This could suggest that Vermeer was supplied with materials by a collector, and would coincide with [[John Michael Montias]]’ theory that [[Pieter van Ruijven]] was Vermeer’s patron</span>
				<span class='text'>ermeer's works are largely [[Genre works|genre pieces]] and portraits, with the exception of two cityscapes and two [[allegory|allegories]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His subjects offer a cross-section of seventeenth-century Dutch society, ranging from the portrayal of a simple milkmaid at work, to the luxury and splendour of rich notables and merchantmen in their roomy houses</span>

				<span class='text'>185-199&lt;/ref&gt;===Theories of mechanical aid===Vermeer's painting techniques have long been a source of debate, given their almost [[photorealistic]] attention to detail, despite Vermeer having had no formal training, and despite only limited evidence that Vermeer had created any preparatory sketches or traces for his paintings</span>
				<span class='text'>n 2001, British artist [[David Hockney]] published the book ''Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters'', in which he argued that Vermeer (among other Renaissance artists including [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]] and [[Diego Velázquez]]) used optics to achieve precise positioning in their compositions, and specifically some combination of [[curved mirror]]s, [[camera obscura]], and [[camera lucida]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This became known as the [[Hockney–Falco thesis]], named after Hockney and [[Charles M</span>
				<span class='text'>Falco]], another proponent of the theory</span>
				<span class='text'>rofessor Philip Steadman published the book ''Vermeer's Camera: Uncovering the Truth behind the Masterpieces'' in 2001 which specifically claimed that Vermeer had used a camera obscura to create his paintings</span>
				<span class='text'>Steadman noted that many of Vermeer's paintings had been painted in the same room, and he found six of his paintings that are precisely the right size if they had been painted from inside a camera obscura in the room's back wall</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=BBC_Steadman/&gt;Supporters of these theories have pointed to evidence in some of Vermeer's paintings, such as the often-discussed sparkling pearly highlights in Vermeer's paintings, which they argue are the result of the primitive lens of a camera obscura producing [[halo (optical phenomenon)|halation]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It was also postulated that a camera obscura was the mechanical cause of the &quot;exaggerated&quot; perspective seen in ''[[The Music Lesson|Lady at the Virginals with a Gentleman]]'' (London, [[Royal Collection]])</span>
				<span class='text'>n 2008, American entrepreneur and inventor [[Tim Jenison]] developed the theory that Vermeer had used a camera obscura along with a &quot;comparator mirror&quot;, which is similar in concept to a camera lucida but much simpler, and makes it easy to match color values</span>
				<span class='text'>He later modified the theory to simply involve a concave mirror and a comparator mirror</span>
				<span class='text'>He spent the next five years testing his theory by attempting to re-create ''The Music Lesson'' himself using these tools, a process captured in the 2013 documentary film ''[[Tim's Vermeer]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Vanity/&gt;Several points were brought out by Jenison in support of this technique: First was Vermeer's hyper-accurate rendition of light falloff along the wall(human eyes cannot detect such slight differences in light&lt;ref name=Tims/&gt;)</span>
				<span class='text'>nother was the addition of several highlights and outlines consistent with matching the effects of [[chromatic aberration]], particularly noticeable in primitive optics</span>
				<span class='text'>Last, and perhaps most telling, is a noticeable curvature in the original painting's rendition of the scrollwork on the harpsichord</span>
				<span class='text'>This effect matched Jenison's technique precisely, caused by exactly duplicating the view as seen from a curved mirror</span>
				<span class='text'>his theory remains disputed</span>
				<span class='text'>There is no historical evidence regarding Vermeer's interest in optics, aside from the accurately observed mirror reflection above the lady at the virginals</span>
				<span class='text'>The detailed inventory of the artist's belongings drawn up after his death does not include a camera obscura or any similar device</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Obscura/&gt; However, Vermeer was in close connection with pioneer Lens maker [[Antoni van Leeuwenhoek]] and Leeuwenhoek was his executor after death</span>

				<span class='text'>The same subject was also painted by Vermeer</span>
				<span class='text'>Almost all of Vermeer's paintings are of contemporary subjects in a smaller format, with a cooler palette dominated by blues, yellows, and grays</span>
				<span class='text'>Practically all of his surviving works belong to this period, usually domestic interiors with one or two figures lit by a window on the left</span>
