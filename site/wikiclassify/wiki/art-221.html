				<span class='text'>The piece was an [[extravaganza]] in which the classical Greek gods, grown elderly, are temporarily replaced by a troupe of 19th-century actors and actresses, one of whom is the eponymous [[Thespis]], the Greek father of the drama</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; but no one at the time anticipated that this was the beginning of a great collaboration</span>
				<span class='text'>Unlike the later Gilbert and Sullivan works, it was hastily prepared, and its nature was more risqué, like Gilbert's earlier [[Victorian burlesque|burlesques]], with a broader style of comedy that allowed for improvisation by the actors</span>
				<span class='text'>Two of the male characters were played by women, whose shapely legs were put on display in a fashion that Gilbert later condemned</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Tillett/&gt;Over the next four years, Gilbert and Sullivan did not have occasion to work together again, but each man became more eminent in his field</span>
				<span class='text'>Gilbert worked with Frederic Clay on ''[[Happy Arcadia]]'' (1872) and with [[Alfred Cellier]] on ''[[Topsyturveydom]]'' (1874), and wrote ''[[The Wicked World]]'' (1873) ''[[Sweethearts (play)|Sweethearts]]'' (1874) and several other libretti, farces, extravaganzas, fairy comedies, dramas and adaptations</span>
				<span class='text'>Sullivan completed his ''[[Festival Te Deum]]'' (1872); another oratorio, ''The Light of the World'' (1873); his only [[song cycle]], ''[[The Window; or, The Song of the Wrens]]'' (1871); [[incidental music]] to ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' (1874); and more songs, parlour ballads, and [[hymn]]s, including &quot;[[Onward, Christian Soldiers]]&quot; (1872)</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time, the audience for theatre was growing because of the rapidly expanding British population; improvement in education and the standard of living, especially of the middle class; improving public transportation; and installation of street lighting, which made travel home from the theatre safer</span>
				<span class='text'>The number of pianos manufactured in England doubled between 1870 and 1890 as more people began to play [[parlour music]] at home and more theatres and concert halls opened</span>

				<span class='text'>Sullivan had one installed as well, and on 13 May 1883, at a party to celebrate the composer's 41st birthday, the guests, including the [[Prince of Wales]] (later [[Edward VII]]), heard a direct relay of parts of ''Iolanthe'' from the Savoy</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|225px|right|upright|1921 cartoon of Gilbert and Sullivan audiences]]In 1922, Sir [[Henry Wood]] explained the enduring success of the collaboration as follows:{{quote|Sullivan has never had an equal for brightness and drollery, for humour without coarseness and without vulgarity, and for charm and grace</span>
				<span class='text'>His orchestration is delightful: he wrote with full understanding of every orchestral voice</span>
				<span class='text'>Above all, his music is perfectly appropriate to the words of which it is the setting</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> He found the right, the only cadences to fit Gilbert's happy and original rhythms, and to match Gilbert's fun or to throw Gilbert's frequent irony, pointed although not savage, into relief</span>
				<span class='text'>Sullivan's music is much more than the accompaniment of Gilbert's libretti, just as Gilbert's libretti are far more than words to Sullivan's music</span>
				<span class='text'>We have two masters who are playing a concerto</span>
				<span class='text'>Neither is subordinate to the other; each gives what is original, but the two, while neither predominates, are in perfect correspondence</span>
				<span class='text'>This rare harmony of words and music is what makes these operas entirely unique</span>
				<span class='text'>They are the work not of a musician and his librettist nor of a poet and one who sets his words to music, but of two geniuses</span>

				<span class='text'>Dutton &amp; Co (1926)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957, a review in ''The Times'' gave this rationale for &quot;the continued vitality of the Savoy operas&quot;:{{quote|&quot;[T]hey were never really contemporary in their idiom</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> Gilbert and Sullivan's [world], from the first moment was obviously not the audience's world, [it was] an artificial world, with a neatly controlled and shapely precision which has not gone out of fashion – because it was never in fashion in the sense of using the fleeting conventions and ways of thought of contemporary human society</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> For this, each partner has his share of credit</span>
				<span class='text'>The neat articulation of incredibilities in Gilbert's plots is perfectly matched by his language</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> His dialogue, with its primly mocking formality, satisfies both the ear and the intelligence</span>
				<span class='text'>His verses show an unequalled and very delicate gift for creating a comic effect by the contrast between poetic form and prosaic thought and wording</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> How deliciously [his lines] prick the bubble of sentiment</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> [Of] equal importance</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Gilbert's lyrics almost invariably take on extra point and sparkle when set to Sullivan's music</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> Sullivan's tunes, in these operas, also exist in a make-believe world of their own</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> [He is] a delicate wit, whose airs have a precision, a neatness, a grace, and a flowing melody</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> The two men together remain endlessly and incomparably delightful</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> Light, and even trifling, though [the operas] may seem upon grave consideration, they yet have the shapeliness and elegance that can make a trifle into a work of art&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>5&lt;/ref&gt;}}Because of the unusual success of the operas, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company were&lt;!--British usage--&gt; able, from the start, to license the works to other professional companies, such as the [[J</span>
				<span class='text'>C</span>
				<span class='text'>Williamson Gilbert and Sullivan Opera Company]], and to amateur troupes</span>
				<span class='text'>For almost a century, until the British copyrights expired at the end of 1961, and even afterwards, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company influenced productions of the operas worldwide, creating a &quot;performing tradition&quot; for most of the operas that is still referred to today by many directors, both amateur and professional</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=JoyRapture&gt;Bradley, Ian</span>
				<span class='text'>''Oh Joy! Oh Rapture! The Enduring Phenomenon of Gilbert and Sullivan'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte had an important influence on amateur theatre</span>
				<span class='text'>Cellier and Bridgeman wrote in 1914 that, prior to the creation of the [[Savoy opera]]s, amateur actors were treated with contempt by professionals</span>
				<span class='text'>After the formation of amateur Gilbert and Sullivan companies in the 1880s licensed to perform the operas, professionals recognised that the amateur performing groups &quot;support the culture of music and the drama</span>
				<span class='text'>They are now accepted as useful training schools for the legitimate stage, and from the volunteer ranks have sprung many present-day favourites</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cellier and Bridgeman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>393&lt;/ref&gt; Cellier and Bridgeman attributed the rise in quality and reputation of the amateur groups largely to &quot;the popularity of, and infectious craze for performing, the Gilbert and Sullivan operas&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cellier and Bridgeman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>394&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Operatic and Dramatic Association]] (NODA) was founded in 1899</span>
				<span class='text'>It reported, in 1914, that nearly 200 British troupes were performing Gilbert and Sullivan that year, constituting most of the amateur companies in the country (this figure included only the societies that were members of NODA)</span>
				<span class='text'>The association further reported that almost 1,000 performances of the [[Savoy opera]]s had been given in Britain that year, many of them to benefit charities</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cellier and Bridgeman, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>394–96&lt;/ref&gt; Cellier and Bridgeman noted that strong amateur groups were performing the operas in places as far away as New Zealand</span>

				<span class='text'>398–99&lt;/ref&gt; In the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> and elsewhere where British copyrights on the operas were not enforced, both professional and amateur companies performed the works throughout the 20th century – the [[Internet Broadway Database]] counts about 150 productions on Broadway alone from 1900 to 1960</span>
