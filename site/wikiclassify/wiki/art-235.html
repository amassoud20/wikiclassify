				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|Part of an 11th-century manuscript, &quot;the Townley Homer&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The writing on the top and right side are [[scholia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>]The chronological period of Homer depends on the meaning to be assigned to the word ‚ÄúHomer</span>
				<span class='text'>Äù If the works attributed either wholly or partially to a blind poet named Homer, were really authored by such a person, then he must have had biographical dates, or a century or other historical period, which can be described as the life and times of Homer</span>
				<span class='text'>If on the other hand Homer is to be considered a mythical character, the legendary founder of a guild of [[rhapsode]]s called the [[Homeridae]], then ‚ÄúHomer‚Äù means the works attributed to the rhapsodes of the guild, who might have composed primarily in a single century or over a period of centuries</span>
				<span class='text'>And finally, much of the geographic and material content of the Iliad and Odyssey appear to be consistent with the Aegean Late Bronze Age, the time of the [[floruit]] of [[Troy]], but not the time of the Greek alphabet</span>
				<span class='text'>The term ‚ÄúHomer‚Äù can be used to mean traditional elements of verse known to the rhapsodes from which they composed oral poetry, which transmitted information concerning the culture of Mycenaean Greece</span>
				<span class='text'>This information is often called ‚Äúthe world of Homer‚Äù (or of Odysseus, or the Iliad)</span>
				<span class='text'>The Homeric period would in that case cover a number of historical periods, especially the Mycenaean Age, prior to the first delivery of a work called the Iliad</span>
				<span class='text'>oncurrent with the questions of whether there was a biographical person named Homer, and what role he may have played in the development of the currently known texts, is the question of whether there ever was a uniform text of the Iliad or Odyssey</span>
				<span class='text'>Considered word-for-word, the printed texts as we know them are the product of the scholars of the last three centuries</span>
				<span class='text'>Each edition of the Iliad or Odyssey is a little different, as the editors rely on different manuscripts and fragments, and make different choices as to the most accurate text to use</span>
				<span class='text'>The term ‚Äúaccuracy‚Äù reveals a fundamental belief in an original uniform text</span>
				<span class='text'>The manuscripts of the whole work currently available date to no earlier than the 10th century</span>
				<span class='text'>These are at the end of a missing thousand-year chain of copies made as each generation of manuscripts disintegrated or were lost or destroyed</span>
				<span class='text'>These numerous manuscripts are so similar that a single original can be postulated</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;A summary of the sources and an analysis of textual uniformity can be found in {{harvnb|Murray|1960|loc=Chapter 12 The Text of Homer From Known to Unknown}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The time gap in the chain is bridged by the [[scholia]], or notes, on the existing manuscripts, which indicate that the original had been published by [[Aristarchus of Samothrace]] in the 2nd century BCE</span>
				<span class='text'>Librarian of the [[Library of Alexandria]], he had noticed a wide divergence in the works attributed to Homer, and was trying to restore a more authentic copy</span>
				<span class='text'>He had collected several manuscripts, which he named: the Sinopic, the Massiliotic, etc</span>
				<span class='text'>The one he selected for correction was the koine, which Murray translates as ‚Äúthe Vulgate‚Äù</span>
				<span class='text'>Aristarchus was known for his conservative selection of material</span>
				<span class='text'>He marked lines that he thought were spurious, not of Homer</span>
				<span class='text'>The entire last book of the Odyssey was marked</span>
				<span class='text'>he koine in turn had come from the first librarian at Alexandria, [[Zenodotus]], who flourished at the beginning of the 3rd century BCE</span>
				<span class='text'> He also was attempting to restore authenticity to manuscripts he found in a state of chaos</span>
				<span class='text'>He set the precedent by marking passages he considered spurious, and by filling in material that seemed to be missing himself</span>
				<span class='text'>Neither Zenodotus nor Aristarchus mentioned any authentic master copy from which to make corrections</span>
				<span class='text'>Their method was intuitive</span>
				<span class='text'>The current division into 24 books each for the Iliad and Odyssey came from Zenodotus</span>
				<span class='text'>urray rejects the concept that an authoritative text for the Vulgate existed at the time of Zenodotus</span>
				<span class='text'>He resorts to the fragments, the quotations of Homer in other works</span>
				<span class='text'>About 200 existed at the time Murray wrote</span>
				<span class='text'>Some of these match the current texts, some seem to paraphrase them, and some are not represented at all</span>
				<span class='text'>Murray cites the [[Shield of Achilles]], which also appears as the [[Shield of Heracles]] in [[Hesiod]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Murray concludes that the epic poems were still in &quot;a fluid state&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He presents 150 BCE as the date after which the text solidifies around the Vulgate</span>
				<span class='text'>Of the 5th century BCE, Murray said {{&quot;'}}Homer' meant to them ‚Ä¶ 'the author of the Iliad and the Odyssey', but we cannot be sure that either ‚Ä¶ was exactly what we mean by those words</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Murray|1960|pp=297‚Äì298}}&lt;/ref&gt;The earliest mention of a work of Homer was by [[Callinus]], a poet who flourished about 650 BCE</span>
				<span class='text'>He attributed the ''[[Thebaid (Greek poem)|Thebais]]'', an epic about the attack on Boeotian Thebes by the [[Epigoni|epigonoi]], to Homer</span>
				<span class='text'>The Thebais was written about the time of the appearance of the Greek alphabet, but it could have been originally oral</span>
				<span class='text'>The Iliad is mentioned by name in Herodotus with regard to the early 6th century, but there is no telling what Iliad that is</span>
				<span class='text'>Almost all the ancient sources from the very earliest appear determined that a Homer, author of the Iliad and Odyssey, existed</span>
				<span class='text'>The author of the Hymn to Apollo identifies himself in the last verse of the poem as a blind man from Chios</span>
				<span class='text'>evertheless it is possible to make a case that Homer was only a mythological character, the supposed founder of the Homeridae</span>
				<span class='text'>  [[Martin Litchfield West|Martin West]] has asserted that &quot;Homer&quot; is &quot;not the name of a historical poet, but a fictitious or constructed name</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= West, Martin|title=The Invention of Homer|journal=Classical Quarterly|volume=49|year=1999|issue=364}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oliver Taplin, in the Oxford History of the Classical World‚Äôs article on Homer, announces that the elements of his life ‚Äúare largely ‚Ä¶ demonstrable fictions</span>

				<span class='text'>Äù His dates for this context are 750-650 BCE, without considering Murray‚Äôs ‚Äúfluid state</span>
				<span class='text'>ÄùWith or without Homer, according to Murray, there is little likelihood that the Iliad and Odyssey of the early sources are the ones we know</span>
				<span class='text'>Based on the fact that the Iliad was recited at the [[Panathenaic Games]], which started in 566 BCE, [[Gregory Nagy]] selects a date of the 6th century for the fixation of the epics, as opposed to Murray‚Äôs 150 BCE</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= [[Gregory Nagy|Nagy, Gregory]]|title=Homeric Poetry and Problems of Multiformity: The &quot;Panathenaic Bottleneck|journal=[[Classical Philology (journal)|Classical Philology]]|volume=96|year=2001|pages=109‚Äì119|doi=10</span>
				<span class='text'>086/449533}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All of these views are only philologic</span>
				<span class='text'>Regardless of whether there was or was not a Homer, or whether the texts of the Homerica were or were not close to the ones that exist today, philology alone does not shed any light on the similarities between Mycenaean culture and the geographical and material props of the world of Homer</span>
				<span class='text'>rchaeology, however, continues to support the theory that much detailed information survived in the form of formulae and stock pieces to be combined creatively by the rhapsodes of later centuries</span>
				<span class='text'>A number of combined archaeological and philological works have been written on the topic, such as [[Denys Page]]‚Äôs ‚ÄúHistory and the Homeric Iliad‚Äù and [[Martin P</span>
				<span class='text'>Nilsson]]‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Mycenaean Origin of Greek Mythology</span>
				<span class='text'>Äù The linguist, [[Calvert Watkins]], went so far as to seek an inherited [[Proto-Indo-European language]] origin for some epithets and the epic verse form</span>

				<span class='text'>omer cannot be presented as a single author of a set of works as they are today describing events of history that are more or less real, apart from the obvious mythology</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1876|loc=Homerus}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ihne chose Smyrna because some of the Vitae identify the word Homer as Aeolic, and Smyrna had an Aeolic background</span>

				<span class='text'>he [[Aeolians]] were one of the three major ethnic groups of ancient Greece, the other two being [[Ionians]] and [[Dorians]]</span>

				<span class='text'>They had their own dialect of East Greek</span>
				<span class='text'>Hesiod as a Boeotian was a member of the group, which is substantiated by the Aeolic phrases related to the name of Homer found in his works</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1876|loc=Aeolis}}&lt;/ref&gt; The villages to which they immigrated were already populated by the descendants of the Trojan War population</span>

				<span class='text'>Aeolis extended from the coast opposite Lesbos to [[Smyrna]] on the edge of [[Ionia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Aeolian League contained 12 cities, including Smyrna</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1876|loc=Smyrna}}&lt;/ref&gt;The political relevance of the two leagues came to a practical end in the latter half of the 5th&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;BCE when most of the cities around the Aegean joined, or were forced to join, the [[Delian League]], a [[koine]] implementing the hegemony of Athens</span>

				<span class='text'>Äù In it, one was required to ask a question of the other, who must reply in verse</span>
				<span class='text'>nable to decide, the judge had them each recite from their poems</span>
				<span class='text'>Hesiod quoted Works and Days; Homer, ‚ÄòIliad‚Äô, both as they are now, but neither poem can have been the modern</span>
				<span class='text'>Hesiod cannot have described beforehand the very event in which he was participating</span>
				<span class='text'>The Iliad is supposed to have been written already</span>
				<span class='text'>It is not called that, however</span>
				<span class='text'>The victory was given to Hesiod because his poem was about peace, but Homer‚Äôs, about war</span>
				<span class='text'>fter the contest, Homer continued his wandering, composing and reciting epic poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>The ‚ÄúCertamen‚Äù mentions the [[Thebaid|Thebais]], quoting the first line, which differs but little from the first line of the Iliad as it is now</span>
				<span class='text'>It had 7000 lines, as did the subsequent [[Epigoni (epic)|Epigoni]], with a similar first line</span>
				<span class='text'>The ‚ÄúCertamen‚Äù qualifies the attribution to Homer with ‚Äúsome say ‚Ä¶</span>
				<span class='text'>Äù Subsequently he wrote the epitaph for Midas‚Äô tomb, for which he got a silver bowl, and then the Odyssey in 12,000 lines (today‚Äôs is 12110)</span>
				<span class='text'>He had already written the Iliad in 15,500 lines (today‚Äôs is 15693)</span>
				<span class='text'>Just these three epics alone are 34,500 lines, word-for-word, we are asked to believe, without reference to the rest of the prodigious Epic Cycle</span>
				<span class='text'>Then he went to Athens, and to [[Argos]], where he delivered lines 559-568 of Book 2 of the Iliad with the addition of two more not in the current version</span>
				<span class='text'>Subsequently he went to [[Delos]], where he delivered the Hymn to Apollo, and was made a citizen of all the Ionian states</span>
				<span class='text'> Going finally to [[Ios (island)|Ios]] he slipped on some clay and suffered a fatal fall</span>
				<span class='text'>he term ‚Äú[[Epic Cycle]]‚Äù (''Epikos Kuklos'') refers to a series of ten epic poems written by different authors purporting to tell an interconnected sequence of stories covering all Greek mythology</span>
				<span class='text'>Themes were selected from them for [[Greek drama]] as well</span>
				<span class='text'>The name appears in the Chrestomathia of [[Eutychius Proclus]], a synopsis  of Greek literature, known only through further abridged fragments  written by [[Photios I of Constantinople]]</span>
				<span class='text'>No etymology was given</span>

				<span class='text'>An analysis of the structure and vocabulary of the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' shows that the poems contain many formulaic phrases typical of extempore epic traditions; even entire verses are at times repeated</span>
				<span class='text'>Parry and his student [[Albert Lord]] pointed out that such elaborate oral tradition, foreign to today's literate cultures, is typical of [[epic poetry]] in a predominantly oral cultural milieu, the key words being &quot;oral&quot; and &quot;traditional&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Parry started with &quot;traditional&quot;: the repetitive chunks of language, he said, were inherited by the singer-poet from his predecessors, and were useful to him in composition</span>

				<span class='text'>= Homeric studies =={{Main|Homeric scholarship}}The study of Homer is one of the oldest topics in scholarship, dating back to antiquity</span>
				<span class='text'>The aims and achievements of Homeric studies have changed over the course of the millennia</span>
				<span class='text'>In the last few centuries, they have revolved around the process by which the Homeric poems came into existence and were transmitted over time to us, first orally and later in writing</span>
				<span class='text'>ome of the main trends in modern Homeric scholarship have been, in the 19th and early 20th centuries, ''Analysis'' and ''Unitarianism'' (see [[Homeric Question]]), schools of thought which emphasized on the one hand the inconsistencies in, and on the other the artistic unity of, Homer; and in the 20th century and later ''Oral Theory'', the study of the mechanisms and effects of oral transmission, and ''Neoanalysis'', the study of the relationship between Homer and other early epic material</span>
				<span class='text'>= Homeric dialect =={{Main|Homeric Greek}}The language used by Homer is an archaic version of [[Ionic Greek]], with admixtures from certain other dialects, such as [[Aeolic Greek]]</span>

				<span class='text'>42‚Äì43&lt;/ref&gt;The cardinal qualities of the style of Homer are well articulated by [[Matthew Arnold]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he translator of Homer should above all be penetrated by a sense of four qualities of his author:‚Äîthat he is eminently rapid; that he is eminently plain and direct, both in the evolution of his thought and in the expression of it, that is, both in his syntax and in his words; that he is eminently plain and direct in the substance of his thought, that is, in his matter and ideas; and finally, that he is eminently noble</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Matthew Arnold, 'On Translating Homer' (Oxford Lecture, 1861) in [[Lionel Trilling]] (ed</span>
				<span class='text'> ''The Portable Matthew Arnold'' (1949) Viking Press, New York 1956 pp</span>
				<span class='text'>204‚Äì228, p</span>
				<span class='text'>211&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The peculiar rapidity of Homer is due in great measure to his use of [[hexameter]] verse</span>
				<span class='text'>It is characteristic of early literature that the evolution of the thought, or the grammatical form of the sentence, is guided by the structure of the verse; and the correspondence which consequently obtains between the rhythm and the syntax‚Äîthe thought being given out in lengths, as it were, and these again divided by tolerably uniform pauses‚Äîproduces a swift flowing movement such as is rarely found when periods are constructed without direct reference to the metre</span>
				<span class='text'>That Homer possesses this rapidity without falling into the corresponding faults, that is, without becoming either fluctuant or monotonous, is perhaps the best proof of his unequalled poetic skill</span>
				<span class='text'>The plainness and directness of both thought and expression which characterise him were doubtless qualities of his age, but the author of the ''[[Iliad]]'' (similar to [[Voltaire]], to whom Arnold happily compares him) must have possessed this gift in a surpassing degree</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''[[Odyssey]]'' is in this respect perceptibly below the level of the ''Iliad''</span>
				<span class='text'>apidity or ease of movement, plainness of expression, and plainness of thought are not distinguishing qualities of the great epic poets [[Virgil]], [[Dante]],&lt;ref&gt;Dante has Virgil introduce Homer, with a sword in hand, as ''poeta sovrano'' (sovereign poet), walking ahead of [[Horace]], [[Ovid]] and [[Marcus Annaeus Lucanus|Lucan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Cf</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[Divine Comedy#Inferno|Inferno]]'' IV, 88&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Milton|Milton]]</span>
				<span class='text'>On the contrary, they belong rather to the humbler epico-lyrical school for which Homer has been so often claimed</span>
				<span class='text'>The proof that Homer does not belong to that school‚Äîand that his poetry is not in any true sense ballad poetry‚Äîis furnished by the higher artistic structure of his poems and, as regards style, by the fourth of the qualities distinguished by Arnold: the quality of nobleness</span>
				<span class='text'>It is his noble and powerful style, sustained through every change of idea and subject, that finally separates Homer from all forms of ballad poetry and popular [[Epic poetry|epic]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ike the French epics, such as the ''[[Chanson de Roland]]'', Homeric poetry is indigenous and, by the ease of movement and its resultant simplicity, distinguishable from the works of Dante, Milton and Virgil</span>
				<span class='text'>It is also distinguished from the works of these artists by the comparative absence of underlying motives or sentiment</span>
				<span class='text'>In Virgil's poetry, a sense of the greatness of [[Rome]] and [[Italy]] is the leading motive of a passionate rhetoric, partly veiled by the considered delicacy of his language</span>
				<span class='text'>Dante and Milton are still more faithful exponents of the religion and politics of their time</span>
				<span class='text'>Even the French epics display sentiments of fear and hatred of the [[Saracens]]; but, in Homer's works, the interest is purely dramatic</span>
				<span class='text'>There is no strong antipathy of race or religion; the war turns on no political events; the capture of [[Troy]] lies outside the range of the ''Iliad''; and even the protagonists are not comparable to the chief national heroes of Greece</span>
				<span class='text'>So far as can be seen, the chief interest in Homer's works is that of human feeling and emotion, and of [[drama]]; indeed, his works are often referred to as &quot;dramas&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>= History and the ''Iliad'' =={{Main|Historicity of the Iliad}}[[File:Homeric Greece</span>
				<span class='text'>vg|left|thumb|Greece according to the ''Iliad'']]The excavations of [[Heinrich Schliemann]] at [[Hisarlik]] in the late 19th century provided initial evidence to scholars that there was an historical basis for the [[Trojan War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Research into oral epics in [[Serbo-Croatian]] and [[Turkic languages]], pioneered by the aforementioned Parry and Lord, began convincing scholars that long poems could be preserved with consistency by oral cultures until they are written down</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name =Parry /&gt; The [[decipherment]] of [[Linear B]] in the 1950s by [[Michael Ventris]] (and others) convinced many of a linguistic continuity between 13th century BCE [[Mycenae]]an writings and the poems attributed to Homer</span>
				<span class='text'>t is probable, therefore, that the story of the [[Trojan War]] as reflected in the Homeric poems derives from a tradition of epic poetry founded on a war which actually took place</span>
				<span class='text'>It is crucial, however, not to underestimate the creative and transforming power of subsequent tradition: for instance, [[Achilles]], the most important character of the ''[[Iliad]]'', is strongly associated with southern [[Thessaly]], but his legendary figure is interwoven into a tale of war whose kings were from the [[Peloponnese]]</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|[[The Apotheosis of Homer]], by Archelaus of Priene (marble relief, possibly 3rd century BCE, now in the [[British Museum]])]]In the Hellenistic period, Homer was the subject of a [[hero cult]] in several cities</span>
				<span class='text'>A shrine, the ''Homereion'', was devoted to him in [[Alexandria]] by [[Ptolemy IV Philopator]] in the late 3rd century BCE</span>
				<span class='text'>This shrine is described in [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]]'s 3rd century CE work ''Varia Historia''</span>
				<span class='text'>He tells how Ptolemy &quot;placed in a circle around the statue [of Homer] all the cities who laid claim to Homer&quot; and mentions a painting of the poet by the artist [[Galaton]], which apparently depicted Homer in the aspect of [[Oceanus]] as the source of all poetry</span>
				<span class='text'> marble relief, found in Italy but thought to have been sculpted in [[Egypt]], depicts the [[apotheosis]] of Homer</span>
				<span class='text'>It shows Ptolemy and his wife or sister [[Arsinoe III]] standing beside a seated poet, flanked by figures from the ''Odyssey'' and ''Iliad'', with the nine [[Muses]] standing above them and a procession of worshippers approaching an altar, believed to represent the Alexandrine Homereion</span>

				<span class='text'>[[Zeus]], the king of the [[Odyssean gods|gods]], presides over the proceedings</span>

				<span class='text'>The Greek script, adapted from a [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] [[syllabary]] around 800 BCE, made possible the notation of the complex rhythms and vowel clusters that make up hexameter verse</span>
				<span class='text'>Homer's poems appear to have been recorded shortly after the alphabet's invention: an inscription from [[Ischia]] in the Bay of [[Naples]], c</span>
				<span class='text'>740 BCE, appears to refer to a text of the ''Iliad''; likewise, illustrations seemingly inspired by the [[Polyphemus]] episode in the ''Odyssey'' are found on [[Samos]], [[Mykonos]] and in Italy, dating from the first quarter of the seventh century BCE</span>
				<span class='text'>We have little information about the early condition of the Homeric poems, but in the second century BCE, Alexandrian editors stabilized this text from which all modern texts descend</span>
				<span class='text'>n [[late antiquity]], knowledge of Greek declined in Latin-speaking western Europe and, along with it, knowledge of Homer's poems</span>
				<span class='text'>It was not until the fifteenth century CE that Homer's work began to be read once more in Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>By contrast it was continually read and taught in the Greek-speaking Eastern Roman Empire where the majority of the classics also survived</span>
				<span class='text'>The first printed edition appeared in 1488 (edited by [[Demetrios Chalkokondyles]] and published by [[Bernardus Nerlius]], [[Nerius Nerlius]], and [[Demetrius Damilas]] in [[Florence, Italy]])</span>
				<span class='text'>ne often finds books of the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' cited by the corresponding letter of the [[Greek alphabet]], with upper-case letters referring to a book number of the ''Iliad'' and lower-case letters referring to the ''Odyssey''</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus Œû 200 would be shorthand for ''Iliad'' book 14, line 200, while Œæ 200 would be ''Odyssey'' 14</span>
