				<span class='text'>From 1976 onward he was also the country's official Head of State as Chairman of the [[State Council of the German Democratic Republic|State Council]] following [[Willi Stoph]]'s relinquishment of the post</span>
				<span class='text'>onecker's political career began in the 1930s when he became an official of the [[Communist Party of Germany]], a position for which he was imprisoned during [[Nazi Germany|the Nazi era]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Following [[World War II]], he was freed and soon relaunched his political activity, founding the youth organisation the [[Free German Youth]] in 1946 and serving as the group's chairman until 1955</span>
				<span class='text'>As the Security Secretary of the Party’s Central Committee in the new East German state, he was the prime organiser of the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961 and, in this function, bore responsibility for the &quot;[[Schießbefehl|order to fire]]&quot; along the [[Inner German border]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1971, he initiated a political power struggle that led, with Soviet support, to his replacing [[Walter Ulbricht]] as [[Leadership of East Germany|First Secretary of the Central Committee]] and as chairman of the state's [[National Defense Council of East Germany|National Defense Council]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Under his command, the country adopted a programme of &quot;consumer socialism&quot; and moved toward the [[international community]] by [[Ostpolitik|normalising relations with West Germany]] and also becoming a full member of the [[United Nations|UN]], in what is considered one of his greatest political successes</span>
				<span class='text'>s [[Cold War]] tensions eased in the late 1980s under the liberalising reforms of Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], Honecker refused all but cosmetic changes to the [[Politics of East Germany|East German political system]] and was consequently forced to resign by his party in October 1989 as the communist regime sought to retain its power</span>
				<span class='text'> Honecker's eighteen years at the helm of the soon-to-collapse German Democratic Republic came to an end</span>
				<span class='text'>ollowing [[German reunification]], he escaped to the Chilean embassy in Moscow in 1991 but was extradited back to Germany a year later to stand trial for his role in the human rights abuse committed by the East German regime</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the proceedings were abandoned due to illness and he was freed from custody to travel to join his family in exile in Chile, where he died in May 1994 from liver cancer</span>

				<span class='text'>The couple had six children together: Katharina (Käthe, 1906–1925), Wilhelm (Willi, 1907–1944), Frieda (1909–1974), Erich, Gertrud (1917–2010) and Karl-Robert (1923–1947)</span>
				<span class='text'>Erich, their fourth child, was born on 25 August 1912 during the period in which the family resided on Max-Braun-Straße, before later moving to Kuchenbergstraße 88 in the present-day Neunkirchen city district of [[Wiebelskirchen]]</span>
