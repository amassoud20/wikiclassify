				<span class='text'>  Philip Augustus 'Dieudonne', [</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> as this epithet demonstrates, was thought to have been given to Louis VII by God, because Louis had been married three times and had to wait many years for the birth of a son</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt; Philip was given the nickname &quot;[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]&quot; by the chronicler [[Rigord]] for having extended the [[Crown lands of France]] so remarkably</span>
				<span class='text'>fter a twelve-year struggle with the [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet dynasty]] in the [[Anglo-French War (1202–14)|Anglo-French War]] of 1202-14, Philip broke up the large [[Angevin Empire]] presided over by the crown of England and defeated a coalition of his rivals ([[Holy Roman Empire|German]], [[County of Flanders|Flemish]] and [[Angevin Empire|English]]) at the [[Battle of Bouvines]] in 1214</span>
				<span class='text'>This victory would have a lasting impact on western European politics: the authority of the French king became unchallenged, while the English King [[John of England|John]] was forced by his barons to sign the [[Magna Carta]] and deal with a rebellion against him aided by Philip, the [[First Barons' War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>he military actions surrounding the [[Albigensian Crusade]] helped prepare the expansion of France southward</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip did not participate directly in these actions, but he allowed his vassals and knights to help carry it out</span>
				<span class='text'>hilip transformed France from a small feudal state into the most prosperous and powerful country in Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>He checked the power of the nobles and helped the towns to free themselves from seigniorial authority, granting privileges and liberties to the emergent [[bourgeoisie]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He built a great wall around Paris (&quot;the [[Wall of Philip II Augustus, Paris|Wall of Philip II Augustus]]&quot;), re-organized the French government and brought financial stability to his country</span>
				<span class='text'>=Early years==[[File:IsabelladeHainault</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|left|thumb|Isabelle, Philip's first wife</span>
				<span class='text'>]Philip was born in [[Gonesse]] on 21 August 1165</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Smedley (1836), p</span>
				<span class='text'>52&lt;/ref&gt; King Louis VII intended to make his son Philip co-ruler with him as soon as possible, in accordance with the traditions of the [[House of Capet]], but these plans were delayed when Philip, at the age of thirteen, was separated from his companions during a royal hunt and became lost in the [[Forest of Compiègne]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He spent much of the following night attempting to find his way out, but to no avail</span>
				<span class='text'>Exhausted by cold, hunger and fatigue, he was eventually discovered by a peasant carrying a charcoal burner, but his exposure to the elements meant he soon contracted a dangerously high fever</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Smedley p55&quot;&gt;Smedley (1836), p</span>
				<span class='text'>55&lt;/ref&gt; His father went on pilgrimage to the Shrine of [[Thomas Becket]] to pray for Philip's recovery and was told that his son had indeed recovered</span>
				<span class='text'>However, on his way back to Paris, he suffered a stroke</span>
				<span class='text'>n declining health, Louis VII had his 14-year-old son crowned and anointed as king at [[Rheims]] on 1 November 1179 by the [[Archbishop of Rheims|Archbishop]] [[Guillaume aux Blanches Mains]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was married on 28 April 1180 to [[Isabelle of Hainaut]], the daughter of [[Baldwin V, Count of Hainaut]], and [[Margaret I, Countess of Flanders]], who brought the [[County of Artois]] as her dowry</span>
				<span class='text'>From the time of his coronation, all real power was transferred to Philip, as his father slowly descended into senility</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Smedley p55&quot; /&gt; The great nobles were discontented with Philip's advantageous marriage, while his mother and four uncles, all of whom exercised enormous influence over Louis, were extremely unhappy with his attainment of the throne, which caused a diminution of their power</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Smedley (1836), p</span>
				<span class='text'>56&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Louis died on 18 September 1180</span>
				<span class='text'>==Consolidation of the royal demesne===[[File:The coronation of Philippe II Auguste in the presence of Henry II of England</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|The coronation of Philip II Augustus in the presence of Henry II of England]]While the royal [[demesne]] had increased under [[Philip I of France|Philip I]] and [[Louis VI of France|Louis VI]], it had diminished slightly under Louis VII</span>
				<span class='text'>In April 1182, partially to enrich the French crown, Philip expelled all Jews from the demesne and confiscated their goods</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip's eldest son [[Louis VIII of France|Louis]] was born on 5 September in 1187 and inherited the County of Artois in 1190, when his mother Isabelle died</span>
				<span class='text'>The main source of funding for Philip's army was from the royal demesne</span>
				<span class='text'>In times of conflict, he could immediately call up 250 knights, 250 horse sergeants, 100 mounted crossbowmen, 133 crossbowmen on foot, 2,000 foot sergeants, and 300 mercenaries</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bradbury|1997|p=252}} Towards the end of his reign, the king could muster some 3,000 knights, 9,000 sergeants, 6,000 urban militiamen, and thousands of foot sergeants</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bradbury|1997|p=280}} Using his increased revenues, Philip was the first Capetian king to build a French navy actively</span>
				<span class='text'>By 1215, his fleet could carry a total of 7,000 men</span>
				<span class='text'>Within two years, his fleet included 10 large ships and many smaller ones</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bradbury|1997|p=242}}===Wars with his vassals===In 1181, Philip began a war with [[Philip, Count of Flanders]], over the [[Vermandois]], which King Philip claimed as his wife's dowry and the Count was unwilling to give up</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally the Count of Flanders invaded France, ravaging the whole district between the [[Somme (river)|Somme]] and the [[Oise]] before penetrating as far as [[Dammartin-en-Goële|Dammartin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Smedley p57&quot;&gt;Smedley (1836), p</span>
				<span class='text'>57&lt;/ref&gt; Notified of Philip's impending approach with 2,000 knights, he turned around and headed back to Flanders</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bradbury|1997|p=245}} Philip chased him, and the two armies confronted each other near [[Amiens]]</span>
				<span class='text'>By this stage, Philip had managed to counter the ambitions of the count by breaking his alliances with [[Henry I, Duke of Brabant]], and [[Philipp von Heinsberg|Philip of Heinsberg]], Archbishop of Cologne</span>
				<span class='text'>This, together with an uncertain outcome were he to engage the French in battle, forced the Count to conclude a peace</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Smedley p57&quot; /&gt; In July 1185, the Treaty of Boves left the disputed territory partitioned, with [[Amiens|Amiénois]], Artois, and numerous other places passing to the king, and the remainder, with the county of Vermandois proper, left provisionally to the Count of Flanders</span>

				<span class='text'>Philip defeated him with the aid of the [[Confrères de la Paix]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==War with Henry II===Philip also began to wage war with King [[Henry II of England]], who was also [[Count of Anjou]] and [[Duke of Normandy]] and [[Duke of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]] in France</span>
				<span class='text'>The death of Henry's eldest son, [[Henry the Young King]], in June 1183, began a dispute over the [[dower]] of Philip's widowed sister [[Margaret of France, Queen of Hungary|Margaret]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip insisted that the dower should be returned to France as the marriage did not produce any children, as per the betrothal agreement</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Smedley p58&quot;&gt;Smedley (1836), p</span>
				<span class='text'>58&lt;/ref&gt; The two kings would hold conferences at the foot of an elm tree near [[Gisors]], which was so positioned that it would overshadow each monarch's territory, but to no avail</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip pushed the case further when King [[Béla III of Hungary]] asked for the widow's hand in marriage, and thus her dowry had to be returned, to which Henry finally agreed</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Wall of Philippe Auguste in Paris</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Remains of the [[Wall of Philip II Augustus]] built around Paris before he went to the Crusades</span>
				<span class='text'>The segment pictured here is found in the Rue des Jardins-Saint-Paul, Paris]]The death in 1186 of Henry's fourth son, [[Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany]], began a new round of disputes, as Henry insisted that he retain the guardianship of the duchy for his unborn grandson [[Arthur I, Duke of Brittany]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Smedley p58&quot; /&gt; Philip, as Henry's liege lord, objected, stating that he should be the rightful guardian until the birth of the child</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip then raised the issue of his other sister, [[Alys, Countess of the Vexin]], and her delayed betrothal to Henry's son [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ith these grievances, two years of combat followed (1186–1188), but the situation remained unchanged</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip initially allied with Henry's young sons Richard the Lionheart and [[John, King of England|John Lackland]], who were in rebellion against their father</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip II launched an attack on [[Berry (province)|Berry]] in the summer of 1187, but in June made a truce with Henry, which left [[Issoudun]] in his hands and also granted him [[Fréteval]] in [[Vendômois]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot; /&gt; Though the truce was for two years, Philip found grounds for resuming hostilities in the summer of 1188</span>
				<span class='text'>He skilfully exploited the estrangement between Henry and Richard, and Richard did homage to him voluntarily at [[Bonsmoulins]] in November 1188</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot; /&gt;In 1189, Richard openly joined forces with Philip to drive Henry into abject submission</span>
				<span class='text'>They chased him from [[Le Mans]] to [[Saumur]], losing [[Tours]] in the process,&lt;ref name=&quot;Smedley p58&quot; /&gt; before forcing him to acknowledge Richard as his heir</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally, by the Treaty of Azay-le-Rideau (4 July 1189), Henry was forced to renew his own homage, confirm the cession of Issoudun to Philip (along with [[Graçay]]), and renounce his claim to suzerainty over [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot; /&gt; Henry died two days later</span>
				<span class='text'>His death, and the news of the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|fall of Jerusalem]] to [[Saladin]], diverted attention from the Franco-English war</span>
				<span class='text'>he [[Angevin Kings of England]] (the line of rulers to which Henry II belonged), were Philip's most powerful and dangerous vassals as Dukes of Normandy and Aquitaine and Counts of Anjou</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip made it his life's work to destroy Angevin power in France</span>
				<span class='text'>One of his most effective tools was to befriend all of Henry's sons and use them to foment rebellion against their father</span>
				<span class='text'>He maintained friendships with Henry the Young King and Geoffrey II until their deaths</span>
				<span class='text'>Indeed, at the funeral of Geoffrey, he was so overcome with grief that he had to be forcibly restrained from casting himself into the grave</span>
				<span class='text'>His friendships with Henry's younger sons Richard and John were discarded once each of them acceded to the English throne</span>
				<span class='text'>=Third Crusade=={{unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}[[File:Philippe Auguste et Richard Acre</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Philip (right) and King Richard I of England accepting the keys to [[Acre, Israel|Acre]]; from the ''[[Grandes Chroniques de France]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>]Philip travelled to the Holy Land to participate in the [[Third Crusade]] of 1189–1192 with King Richard I of England and Holy Roman Emperor [[Frederick I Barbarossa]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His army left [[Vézelay]] on 1 July 1190</span>
				<span class='text'>At first, the French and English crusaders travelled together, but the armies split at [[Lyon]], after Richard decided to go by sea, whereas Philip took the overland route through the [[Alps]] to [[Genoa]]</span>
				<span class='text'> The French and English armies were reunited in [[Messina]], where they wintered together</span>
				<span class='text'> On 30 March 1191, the French set sail for the Holy Land and Philip arrived on 20 May</span>
				<span class='text'>He then marched to [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], which was already [[Siege of Acre (1189–1191)|under siege]] by a lesser contingent of crusaders, and he started to construct siege equipment before Richard arrived on 8 June</span>
				<span class='text'> By the time Acre surrendered on 12 July, Philip was severely ill with [[dysentery]], which reduced his zeal</span>
				<span class='text'>Ties with Richard were further strained after the latter acted in a haughty manner after Acre fell to the crusaders</span>
				<span class='text'>ore importantly, the siege of Acre resulted in the death of Philip, Count of Flanders, who held the county of Vermandois proper</span>
				<span class='text'> His death threatened to derail the Treaty of Gisors that Philip had orchestrated to isolate the powerful [[Blois-Champagne faction]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Philip decided to return to France to settle the issue of succession in Flanders, a decision that displeased Richard, who said, &quot;It is a shame and a disgrace on my lord if he goes away without having finished the business that brought him hither</span>
				<span class='text'>But still, if he finds himself in bad health, or is afraid lest he should die here, his will be done</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;  On 31 July 1191, the French army of 10,000 men (along with 5,000 silver marks to pay the soldiers) remained in [[Outremer]] under the command of [[Hugh III, Duke of Burgundy]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Philip and his cousin [[Peter II of Courtenay|Peter of Courtenay]], [[Count of Nevers]], made their way to Genoa and from there returned to France</span>
				<span class='text'> The decision to return was also fuelled by the realisation that with Richard campaigning in the Holy Land, English possessions in northern France would be open to attack</span>
				<span class='text'> After Richard's delayed return home, war between England and France would ensue over possession of English-controlled territories</span>
				<span class='text'>=Conflict with England, Flanders and the Holy Roman Empire=====Conflict with King Richard the Lionheart, 1192–1199===The immediate cause of Philip's conflict with [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] stemmed from Richard's decision to break his betrothal with Phillip's sister [[Alys]] at [[Messina]] in 1191</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Rees p1&quot;&gt;Rees (2006), p</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt; Part of Alys's dowry that had been given over to Richard during their engagement was the territory of the [[Vexin]], which included the strategic fortress of [[Gisors]]</span>
				<span class='text'> This should have reverted to Philip upon the end of the betrothal, but Philip, to prevent the collapse of the Crusade, agreed that this territory was to remain in Richard's hands and would be inherited by his male descendents</span>
				<span class='text'> Should Richard die without an heir, the territory would return to Philip, and if Philip died without an heir, those lands would be considered a part of Normandy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Rees p1&quot; /&gt;Returning to France in late 1191, Phillip began plotting to find a way to have those territories restored to him</span>
				<span class='text'>He was in a difficult situation, as he had taken an oath not to attack Richard's lands while he was away on crusade</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Smedley (1836), p</span>
				<span class='text'>62&lt;/ref&gt; The Third Crusade ordained territory was under the protection of the Church in any event</span>
				<span class='text'> Philip had unsuccessfully asked [[Pope Celestine III]] to release him from his oath,&lt;ref name=&quot;Smedley p63&quot;&gt;Smedley (1836), p</span>
				<span class='text'>63&lt;/ref&gt; was declined, forcing this caesar of France to build his own [[casus belli]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 20 January 1192, Philip met with [[William FitzRalph]], Richard's [[seneschal]] of Normandy</span>
				<span class='text'>Presenting some documents purporting to be from Richard, Philip claimed that the English king had agreed at Messina to hand disputed lands over to France</span>
				<span class='text'> Not having heard anything directly from their sovereign, FitzRalph and the Norman barons rejected Philip's claim to [[The Vexin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Rees p1&quot; /&gt; Philip at this time also began spreading rumours about Richard's action in the east to discredit the English king in the eyes of his subjects</span>
				<span class='text'>Among the stories Philip invented included Richard involved in treacherous communication with [[Saladin]], alleging he had conspired to cause the fall of [[Gaza City|Gaza]], [[Jaffa]], and [[Ashkelon]], and that he had participated in the murder of [[Conrad of Montferrat]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Smedley p63&quot; /&gt; Finally, Philip made contact with Prince John, Richard's brother, whom he convinced to join the conspiracy to overthrow the legitimate king of England</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Smedley p63&quot; /&gt;At the start of 1193, Prince John visited Philip in Paris, where he paid homage for Richard's continental lands</span>
				<span class='text'> When word reached Philip that Richard had finished crusading was captured on his way back from the Holy Land, he promptly invaded the Vexin</span>
				<span class='text'> His first target was the fortress of Gisors, commanded by [[Gilbert de Vascoeuil]], which surrendered without putting up a struggle</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Rees p2&quot;&gt;Rees (2006), p</span>
				<span class='text'>2&lt;/ref&gt; Philip then penetrated deep into Normandy, reaching as far as [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]]</span>
				<span class='text'> To keep the duplicitous John on his side, Philip entrusted him with the defence of the town of [[Évreux]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Smedley (1836), p</span>
				<span class='text'>64&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Philip was joined by [[Baldwin I of Constantinople|Count Baldwin of Flanders]], and together they laid siege to [[Rouen]], the ducal capital of Normandy</span>
				<span class='text'>Here, Philip's advance was halted by a defence led by the [[Robert de Beaumont, 4th Earl of Leicester|Earl of Leicester]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Rees p2&quot; /&gt; Unable to penetrate this defence, Philip moved on</span>
				<span class='text'>t [[Mantes]] on 9 July 1193, Philip came to terms with Richard's ministers, who agreed that Philip could keep his gains and would be given some extra territories if he ceased all further aggressive actions in Normandy, along with the condition that Philip would hand back the captured territory if Richard would pay homage</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Rees p2&quot; /&gt; To prevent Richard from spoiling their plans, Philip and John attempted to bribe Holy Roman Emperor [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]] in order to keep the English king captive for a little while longer</span>
				<span class='text'> Henry refused, and Richard was released from captivity on 4 February 1194</span>
				<span class='text'> By 13 March Richard had returned to England, and by 12 May he had set sail for Normandy with some 300 ships, eager to engage Philip in war</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Rees p2&quot; /&gt;Philip had spent this time consolidating his territorial gains and by now controlled much of Normandy east of the [[Seine]], while remaining within striking distance of Rouen</span>
				<span class='text'>His next objective was the castle of [[Verneuil-sur-Avre|Verneuil]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees p3&quot;&gt;Rees (2006), p</span>
				<span class='text'>3&lt;/ref&gt; which had withstood an earlier siege</span>
				<span class='text'> Once Richard arrived at [[Barfleur]], he soon marched towards Verneuil</span>
				<span class='text'> As his forces neared the castle, Philip, who had been unable to break through, decided to strike camp</span>
				<span class='text'> Leaving a large force behind to prosecute the siege, he moved off towards Évreux, which Prince John had handed over to his brother to prove his loyalty</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Rees p3&quot; /&gt; Philip retook the town and sacked it, but during this time, his forces at Verneuil abandoned the siege, and Richard entered the castle unopposed on 30 May</span>
				<span class='text'>Throughout June, while Philip's campaign ground to a halt in the north, Richard was taking a number of important fortresses to the south</span>
				<span class='text'> Philip, eager to relieve the pressure off his allies in the south, marched to confront Richard's forces at [[Vendôme]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Refusing to risk everything in a major battle, Philip retreated, only to have his rear guard caught at [[Fréteval]] on 3 July</span>
				<span class='text'>This turned into a general encounter in which Philip barely managed to avoid capture as his army was put to flight</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Rees p3&quot; /&gt; Fleeing back to Normandy, Philip avenged himself on the English by attacking the forces of Prince John and the [[William d'Aubigny, 3rd Earl of Arundel|Earl of Arundel]], seizing their baggage train</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Rees p3&quot; /&gt; By now both sides were tiring, and they agreed to the temporary Truce of Tillières</span>
				<span class='text'>ar continually raged during 1195, when Philip once again besieged Verneuil</span>
				<span class='text'>Richard arrived to discuss the situation face to face</span>
				<span class='text'>During negotiations, Philip secretly continued his operations against Verneuil; when Richard found out, he left, swearing revenge</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Rees p3&quot; /&gt; Philip now pressed his advantage in northeastern Normandy, where he conducted a raid at [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]], burning the English ships in the harbour while repulsing an attack by Richard at the same time</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip now marched southward into the Berry region</span>
				<span class='text'>His primary objective was the fortress of [[Issoudun]], which had just been captured by Richard's mercenary commander, [[Mercadier]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The French king took the town and was besieging the castle when Richard stormed through French lines and made his way in to reinforce the garrison, while at the same time another army was approaching Philip's supply lines</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip called off his attack, and another truce was agreed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Rees p3&quot; /&gt;The war slowly turned against Philip over the course of the next three years</span>
				<span class='text'>Political and military conditions seemed promising at the start of 1196, when Richard's nephew [[Arthur of Brittany]] ended up in Philip's hands, and he won the Siege of [[Aumale]], but Philip's good fortune did not last</span>
				<span class='text'> Richard won over a key ally, [[Baldwin of Flanders]], in 1197</span>
				<span class='text'>Then, in 1198, Holy Roman Emperor Henry VI died</span>
				<span class='text'> His successor was to be [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto IV]], Richard's nephew, who put additional pressure on Philip</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Rees p4&quot;&gt;Rees (2006), p</span>
				<span class='text'>4&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, many Norman lords were switching sides and returning to Richard's camp</span>
				<span class='text'> This was the state of affairs when Philip launched his campaign of 1198 with an attack on the Vexin</span>
				<span class='text'> He was pushed back and then had to deal with the Flemish invasion of [[Artois]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 27 September, Richard entered the Vexin, taking [[Courcelles-sur-Seine]] and [[Boury-en-Vexin]] before returning to [[Dangu, Eure|Dangu]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip, believing that Courcelles was still holding out, went to its relief</span>
				<span class='text'>Discovering what was happening, Richard decided to attack the French king's forces, catching Philip by surprise</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Rees p4&quot; /&gt; Philip's forces fled and attempted to reach the fortress of Gisors</span>
				<span class='text'>Bunched together, the French knights with king Philip attempted to cross the [[Epte]] River on a bridge that promptly collapsed under their weight, almost drowning Philip in the process</span>
				<span class='text'>He was dragged out of the river and shut himself up in Gisors</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Rees p4&quot; /&gt;Philip soon planned a new offensive, launching raids into Normandy and again targeting Évreux</span>
				<span class='text'>Richard countered Philip's thrust with a counterattack in the Vexin, while Mercadier led a raid on [[Abbeville]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The upshot was that by the autumn 1198, Richard had regained almost all that had been lost in 1193</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Rees p4&quot; /&gt; In desperate circumstances, Philip offered a truce so that discussions could begin towards a more permanent peace, with the offer that he would return all of the territories except for Gisors</span>
				<span class='text'>n mid-January 1199, the two kings met for a final meeting, Richard standing on the deck of a boat, Philip standing on the banks of the Seine River</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Rees p5&quot;&gt;Rees (2006), p</span>
				<span class='text'>5&lt;/ref&gt; Shouting terms at each other, they could not reach agreement on the terms of a permanent truce, but they did agree to further mediation, which resulted in a five-year truce that held</span>
				<span class='text'>Later in 1199, Richard was killed during a siege involving one of his vassals</span>
				<span class='text'>==Conflict with King John, 1200–1206==={{Main|Normandy campaigns of 1200–1204|Anglo-French War (1202–1214)}}In May 1200, Philip signed the [[Treaty of Le Goulet]] with Richard's successor [[John Lackland]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The treaty was meant to bring peace to Normandy by settling the issue of its much-reduced boundaries</span>
				<span class='text'> The terms of John's vassalage were not only for Normandy, but also for [[Anjou]], Maine, and [[Touraine]]</span>
				<span class='text'> John agreed to heavy terms, including the abandonment of all the English possessions in Berry and 20,000 marks of silver, while Philip in turn recognised John as king of England, formally abandoning Arthur of Brittany's candidacy, whom he had hitherto supported,  recognising instead John's suzerainty over the [[Duchy of Brittany]]</span>
				<span class='text'> To seal the treaty, a marriage between [[Blanche of Castile]], John's niece, and [[Louis VIII of France|Louis the Lion]], Philip's son, was contracted</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Territorial Conquests of Philip II of France</span>
				<span class='text'>ng|thumb|Territorial Conquests of Philip II of France]]This agreement did not bring warfare to an end in France, however, since John's mismanagement of Aquitaine led the province to erupt in rebellion later in 1200, a disturbance that Philip secretly encouraged</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Smedley p67&quot;&gt;Smedley (1836), p</span>
				<span class='text'>67&lt;/ref&gt; To disguise his ambitions, Philip invited John to a conference at [[Les Andelys|Andely]] and then entertained him at Paris, and both times he committed to complying with the treaty</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Smedley p67&quot; /&gt; In 1202, disaffected patrons petitioned the French king to summon John to answer their charges in his capacity as John's feudal lord in France</span>
				<span class='text'> John refused to appear, so Philip again took up Arthur of Brittany's claims to the English throne and betrothed his six-year-old daughter [[Marie of France, Duchess of Brabant|Marie]]</span>
				<span class='text'> In riposte John crossed over into Normandy</span>
				<span class='text'> His forces soon captured Arthur, and in 1203, the young man disappeared, with most people believing that John had had him murdered</span>
				<span class='text'> The outcry over Arthur's fate saw an increase in local opposition to John, which Philip used to his advantage</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Smedley p67&quot; /&gt; He took the offensive and, apart from a five-month siege of Andely, swept all before him</span>
				<span class='text'> After Andely surrendered, John fled to England</span>
				<span class='text'> By the end of 1204, most of Normandy and the Angevin lands, including much of [[Aquitaine]], had fallen into Philip's hands</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Smedley p67&quot; /&gt;What Philip had gained through victory in war, he sought to confirm by legal means</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip, again acting as John's liege lord over his French lands, summoned him to appear before the [[Court of the Twelve Peers]] of France to answer for the murder of Arthur of Brittany</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Smedley p68&quot;&gt;Smedley (1836), p</span>
				<span class='text'>68&lt;/ref&gt; John requested safe conduct, but Philip only agreed to allow him to come in peace, while providing for his return only if it were allowed to after the judgment of his peers</span>
				<span class='text'> Not willing to risk his life on such a guarantee, John refused to appear, so Philip summarily dispossessed the English of all lands</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Smedley p68&quot; /&gt; Pushed by his barons, John eventually launched an invasion of northern France in 1206</span>
				<span class='text'>He disembarked with his army at [[La Rochelle]] during one of Philip's absences, but the campaign was a disaster</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Smedley p68&quot; /&gt; After backing out of a conference that he himself had demanded, John eventually bargained at [[Thouars]] for a two-year truce, the price of which was his agreement to the chief provisions of the judgment of the Court of Peers, including a loss of his patrimony</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Denier tournois coin of Philip II]]In 1208, [[Philip of Swabia]], the successful candidate to assume the throne of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], was assassinated</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, the imperial crown was given to his rival [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto IV]], the nephew of King John</span>
				<span class='text'>Otto, prior to his accession, had promised to help John recover his lost possessions in France, but circumstances prevented him from making good on his promise</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Smedley p69&quot;&gt;Smedley (1836), p</span>
				<span class='text'>69&lt;/ref&gt; By 1212, both John and Otto were engaged in power struggles against [[Pope Innocent III]]:  John over his refusal to accept the papal nomination for the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], and Otto over his attempt to strip [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], King of the Germans (and later Holy Roman Emperor), of his Sicilian crown</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip decided to take advantage of this situation, first in Germany, where he aided German noble rebellion in support of the young Frederick</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Smedley p69&quot; /&gt; John immediately threw England's weight behind Otto, and Philip now saw his chance to launch a successful invasion of England</span>
				<span class='text'>n order to secure the cooperation of all his vassals in his plans for the invasion, Philip denounced John as an enemy of the Church, thereby justifying his attack as motivated solely by religious scruples</span>
				<span class='text'>He summoned an assembly of French barons at [[Soissons]], which was well attended with the exception of [[Ferdinand, Count of Flanders]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Ferdinand refused to attend, still angry over the loss of the towns of [[Aire-sur-la-Lys|Aire]] and [[Saint-Omer]] that had been captured by Philip's son Louis the Lion</span>
				<span class='text'>He would not participate in any campaign until restored to all ancient lands</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Smedley p69&quot; /&gt;Philip was eager to prove his loyalty to Rome and thus secure papal support for his planned invasion, announced at Soissons a reconciliation with his estranged wife [[Ingeborg of Denmark, Queen of France|Ingeborg of Denmark]], which the popes had been promoting</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Smedley p69&quot; /&gt; The barons fully supported his plan, and they all gathered their forces and prepared to join with Philip at the agreed rendezvous</span>
				<span class='text'> Through all of this, Philip remained in constant communication with [[Pandulf Verraccio]], the [[papal legate]], who was encouraging Philip to pursue his objective</span>
				<span class='text'> Verraccio however was also holding secret discussions with King John</span>
				<span class='text'> Advising the English king of his precarious predicament, he persuaded John to abandon his opposition to [[Investiture Controversy|papal investiture]] and agreed to accept the papal legate's decision in any ecclesiastical disputes as final</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Smedley p70&quot;&gt;Smedley (1836), p</span>
				<span class='text'>70&lt;/ref&gt; In return, the pope agreed to accept the [[Kingdom of England]] and the [[Lordship of Ireland]] as papal fiefs, which John would rule as the pope's vassal, and for which John would do homage to the pope</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Smedley p70&quot; /&gt;No sooner had the treaty between John and the pope been ratified in May 1213 than Verraccio announced to Philip that he would have to abandon his expedition against John, since to attack a faithful vassal of the [[Holy See]] would constitute a [[mortal sin]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Philip argued in vain that his plans had been drawn up with the consent of Rome, that his expedition was in support of papal authority that he only undertook on the understanding that he would gain a [[Indulgence|plenary indulgence]]; he had spent a fortune preparing for the expedition</span>
				<span class='text'> The papal legate remained unmoved,&lt;ref name=&quot;Smedley p70&quot; /&gt; but Verraccio did suggest an alternative</span>
				<span class='text'> The Count of Flanders had denied Philip's right to declare war on England while King John was still [[excommunicated]], and that his disobedience needed to be punished</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Smedley p70&quot; /&gt; Philip eagerly accepted the advice, and quickly marched at the head of his troops into the territory of Flanders</span>

				<span class='text'>Meanwhile the army marched by [[Cassel, Nord|Cassel]], [[Ypres]], and [[Bruges]] before laying siege to [[Ghent]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Smedley p71&quot; /&gt; Hardly had the siege begun when Philip learned that the English fleet had captured a number of his ships at Dam and that the rest were so closely blockaded in its harbor that it was impossible for them to escape</span>
				<span class='text'>After having obtained 30,000 marks as a ransom for the hostages he had taken from the Flemish cities he had captured, Philip quickly retraced his steps to reach Dam</span>
				<span class='text'>It took him two days, arriving in time to relieve the French garrison, but he discovered he could not rescue his fleet</span>
				<span class='text'> He ordered it to be burned to prevent it from falling into enemy hands, then he commanded the town of Dam to be burned to the ground as well</span>
				<span class='text'> Determined to make the Flemish pay for his retreat, in every district he passed through he ordered that all towns be razed and burned, and that the peasantry be either killed or sold as slaves</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Smedley p71&quot; /&gt;The destruction of the French fleet had once again raised John's hopes, so he began preparing for an invasion of France and a reconquest of his lost provinces</span>
				<span class='text'> The English barons were initially unenthusiastic about the expedition, which delayed his departure, so it was not until February 1214 that he disembarked at La Rochelle</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Smedley p71&quot; /&gt; John was to advance from the [[Loire (river)|Loire]], while his ally Otto IV made a simultaneous attack from Flanders, together with the Count of Flanders</span>
				<span class='text'>Unfortunately, the three armies could not coordinate their efforts effectively</span>
				<span class='text'> It was not until John had been disappointed in his hope for an easy victory after being driven from [[Roche-au-Moine]] and had retreated to his transports that the Imperial Army, with Otto at its head, assembled in the [[Low Countries]]</span>

				<span class='text'>]On 27 July 1214, the opposing armies suddenly discovered they were in close proximity, on the banks of a little tributary of the [[River Lys]], near the Bridge of [[Bouvines]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip's army numbered some 15,000, while the allied forces possessed around 25,000 troops</span>
				<span class='text'>The armies clashed at the [[Battle of Bouvines]], a tight battle</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip was unhorsed by the Flemish pikemen in the heat of battle, and were it not for his plate mail armor he would have probably been killed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Smedley p72&quot;&gt;Smedley (1836), p</span>
				<span class='text'>72&lt;/ref&gt; When Otto was carried off the field by his wounded and terrified horse,&lt;ref name=&quot;Smedley p72&quot; /&gt; and the Count of Flanders was severely wounded and taken prisoner</span>
				<span class='text'> The Flemish and Imperial troops saw that the battle was lost, turned, and fled the field</span>
				<span class='text'>The French troops began pursuing them, but with night approaching, and with the prisoners they already had too numerous and, more importantly, too valuable to risk in a pursuit, Philip ordered a recall before his troops had moved little more than a mile from the battlefield</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Smedley p72&quot; /&gt;Philip returned to Paris triumphant, marching his captive prisoners behind him in a long procession, as his grateful subjects came out to greet the victorious king</span>
				<span class='text'>In the aftermath of the battle, Otto retreated to his castle of [[Harzburg]] and was soon overthrown as [[Holy Roman Emperor]], to be replaced by [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Count Ferdinand remained imprisoned following his defeat, while King John obtained a five-year truce, on very lenient terms given the circumstances</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Smedley p72&quot; /&gt;Philip's decisive victory was crucial in shaping Western European politics in both England and France</span>
				<span class='text'>In England, the defeated John was so weakened that he was soon required to submit to the demands of his barons and sign the [[Magna Carta]], which limited the power of the crown and established the basis for common law</span>
				<span class='text'>In France, the battle was instrumental in forming the strong central monarchy that would characterise its rule until the first [[French Revolution]]</span>

				<span class='text'>She was renamed Isambour, and [[Stephen of Tournai]] described her as &quot;very kind, young of age but old of wisdom</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; For some unknown reason, Philip was repelled by her, and he refused to allow her to be crowned queen</span>
				<span class='text'>Ingeborg protested at this treatment; his response was to confine her to a convent</span>
				<span class='text'>He then asked [[Pope Celestine III]] for an annulment on the grounds of non-consummation</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip had not reckoned with Isambour, however; she insisted that the marriage had been consummated, and that she was his wife and the rightful queen of France</span>
				<span class='text'>The Franco-Danish churchman [[William of Paris (saint)|William of Paris]] intervened on the side of Ingeborg, drawing up a [[genealogy]] of the Danish kings to disprove the alleged impediment of [[consanguinity]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n the meantime, Philip had sought a new bride</span>
				<span class='text'>Initial agreement had been reached for him to marry [[Margaret of Geneva]], daughter of [[William I, Count of Geneva]], but the young bride's journey to Paris was interrupted by [[Thomas I of Savoy]], who kidnapped Philip's intended new queen and married her instead, claiming that Philip was already bound in marriage</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip finally achieved a third marriage on 7 May 1196, when he was married to [[Agnes of Merania]] from Dalmatia</span>
				<span class='text'>Their children were [[Marie of France (1198–1224)|Marie]] and [[Philip I, Count of Boulogne|Philip]], [[Count of Clermont]], and, by marriage, [[Count of Boulogne]]</span>

				<span class='text'>He ordered the king to part from Agnes, and when he did not, the pope placed France under an interdict in 1199</span>
				<span class='text'>This continued until 7 September 1200</span>
