				<span class='text'>In 1958, he founded the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] and was elected as the 18th [[President of France]], until his resignation in 1969</span>
				<span class='text'>He was the dominant figure of France during the [[Cold War]] era and his memory continues to influence French politics</span>
				<span class='text'>orn in [[Lille]], he graduated from [[Ecole Spéciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr|Saint-Cyr]] in 1912</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a decorated officer of the [[First World War]], wounded several times and later taken prisoner at [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He tried to escape with a fellow prisoner, but failed several times</span>
				<span class='text'>After the war ended, he was released</span>
				<span class='text'>During the interwar period he advocated mobile armoured divisions</span>
				<span class='text'>At the beginning of the [[Second World War]], he led an [[4e Division cuirassée|armoured division]] which counterattacked the invading German army, before being appointed to the French Government as Under-Secretary for War</span>
				<span class='text'>Refusing to accept his government's [[Second Armistice at Compiègne|armistice with Nazi Germany]] in 1940, de Gaulle exhorted the French population to resist occupation and to continue the fight against [[Axis powers]] in his [[Appeal of 18 June]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He led a [[French Committee of National Liberation|government in exile]] and the [[Free French Forces]] against the Axis</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite frosty relations with Britain and especially the United States, he emerged as the undisputed leader of the French resistance</span>
				<span class='text'>He became Head of the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]] in June 1944, the interim government of France following [[liberation of France|its Liberation]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;He was &quot;Chef du gouvernement provisoire de la République&quot;, and from November 1945: &quot;Président du gouvernement provisoire de la République&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>He retired in the early 1950s and wrote his ''War Memoirs,'' which quickly became a classic of modern French literature</span>
				<span class='text'>When the [[Algerian war]] was ripping apart the unstable Fourth Republic, the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] brought him back to power during the [[May 1958 crisis (France)|May 1958 crisis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>De Gaulle founded the Fifth Republic with a strong presidency, and he was elected in the latter role</span>
				<span class='text'>He managed to keep France together while taking steps to end the war, much to the anger of the [[Pieds-Noirs]] (Frenchmen settled in Algeria) and the military; both previously had supported his return to power to maintain colonial rule</span>
				<span class='text'>He granted independence to Algeria and progressively to other French colonies</span>
				<span class='text'>n the context of the Cold War, de Gaulle initiated his &quot;Politics of Grandeur&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kolodziej&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Kolodziej|first= Edward A|title=French International Policy under de Gaulle and Pompidou: The Politics of Grandeur|year=1974|page=618}}&lt;/ref&gt; asserting that France as a major power should not rely on other countries, such as the United States, for its national security and prosperity</span>
				<span class='text'>To this end, de Gaulle pursued a policy of &quot;national independence&quot; which led him to withdraw from [[NATO|NATO's]] military integrated command and to launch an independent [[Force de dissuasion|nuclear development program]] that made France the [[France and weapons of mass destruction|fourth nuclear power]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He [[Élysée Treaty|restored]] cordial [[Franco-German relations]] in order to create a European counterweight between the &quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot; (American and British) and Soviet spheres of influence</span>

				<span class='text'>Nonetheless, de Gaulle resigned in 1969 after losing a [[French constitutional referendum, 1969|referendum]] in which he proposed more decentralization</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Fenby p 41&lt;/ref&gt;  De Gaulle's father encouraged historical and philosophical debate between his children at mealtimes, and through his encouragement, de Gaulle grew familiar with French history from an early age</span>
				<span class='text'>Struck by his mother's tale of how she cried as a child when she heard of the French capitulation to the Germans at [[Battle of Sedan (1870)|Sedan]] in 1870, he developed a keen interest in military strategy and endlessly questioned his father about the other failures of the brief war at [[Battle of Mars-la-Tour|Vionville and Mars-la-Tour]], and though a naturally shy person his entire life, often organised other children to reenact ancient French battles</span>
				<span class='text'>The wider de Gaulle family were also very literary and academic, and he was raised on tales of the flight of the Scottish Stuarts to France, to whom he was related on his mother's side</span>
				<span class='text'>He was also influenced by his uncle, also called [[Charles de Gaulle (poet)|Charles de Gaulle]], who was a historian and passionate [[Celticist]] who wrote books and pamphlets advocating the union of the Welsh, Scots, Irish and [[Bretons]] into one people</span>
				<span class='text'>His grandfather Julien-Philippe was also a historian, and his grandmother Josephine-Marie wrote poems which impassioned his Christian faith</span>

				<span class='text'>Charles received a rigorous classical education that included a year 1907–08 at a Jesuit college in Belgium</span>
				<span class='text'>y the time he was ten he was reading medieval history, such as the [[Chronicles of Froissart|Froissart's Chronicles]] of the [[Hundred Years War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>De Gaulle began his own writing in his early teens, and later his family paid for a composition, a one-act play in verse about a traveller, to be privately published</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pedley&quot;/&gt;  Always a voracious reader, he later favored philosophical tomes by such writers as [[Henri Bergson]], [[Charles Péguy]], and [[Maurice Barrès]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;De Gaulle was educated in Paris at the [[Collège Stanislas de Paris|College Stanislas]] and also briefly in Belgium where he continued to display his interest in reading and studying history and shared the great pride many of his countrymen felt in their nation's achievements</span>
				<span class='text'>This was not unusual among his peers, who came up in a generation of Frenchmen for whom patriotic and Catholic fervor was rising once again after the long decades of nihilism and anti-clericalism that characterized the post-Revolution country</span>
				<span class='text'>As he grew older, he also developed a profound belief in his destiny to achieve great things, and, eager to avenge the French defeat of 1870, decided upon a military career as being the best way to make a name for himself</span>
				<span class='text'>He matriculated at the Saint Cyr military academy in 1908 where he did well; in 1911 he was commissioned in the French army</span>

				<span class='text'>However, he often quarreled with his company commander and other officers that there was a lack of preparation for war with Germany, and that the French training and equipment were inadequate to deal with a numerically superior adversary</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Schoenbrun&quot;/&gt; Graduating in 1912, he finished 13th out of a class of 230 and his passing-out report noted that he was a gifted cadet who would undoubtedly make an excellent officer</span>
				<span class='text'>Preferring to serve in France rather than the distant overseas colonies, he joined the 33rd Infantry Regiment of the [[French Army]], based at [[Arras, France|Arras]] and commanded by Colonel (and future Marshal) [[Philippe Pétain]]</span>
				<span class='text'>De Gaulle would follow Pétain for the next 20 years</span>
				<span class='text'>{r|time19590105}}While at Arras, and in the build-up to [[World War I]], de Gaulle developed a good rapport with his commanding officer, Pétain, with whom he shared a number of ideas on French military affairs, and was often seen on exercise and in officers' quarters with his superior debating great battles and the likely outcome of any coming war</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Schoenbrun /&gt; They shared the views of many rising young officers that the new methods of warfare meant that traditional tactics were obsolete and cavalry would no longer serve a useful purpose in the age of machine guns and barbed wire</span>

				<span class='text'>However, the [[French Fifth Army]] commander, General [[Charles Lanrezac]] remained wed to 19th century battle tactics, throwing his units into pointless bayonet charges with bugles and [[Colours, standards and guidons|full colours]] flying against the German artillery, incurring heavy losses</span>

				<span class='text'>Yet, with General [[Joseph Joffre|Joseph Joffre's]] decision to stop the retreat and counter-attack, favoured by the arrival of British units and by changes in the command structure, the rapid German advance was eventually stalled by mid September at the [[First Battle of the Marne]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Returning in the [[Marne]] in late 1914 to find many of his former comrades dead, he was put in charge of a company</span>
				<span class='text'>De Gaulle's unit gained recognition for repeatedly crawling out into [[No mans land]] to listen to the conversations of the enemy in their trenches, and the information he brought back was so valuable that in January 1915 he received a citation for his bravery</span>

				<span class='text'>This came about because of his reading German newspapers (he had learned German at school and spent a summer vacation in the [[Black Forest]] region) and giving talks on his view of the progress of the conflict to fellow prisoners</span>

				<span class='text'>He distinguished himself in operations near the [[Zbrucz|River Zbrucz]] and won Poland's highest military decoration, the Virtuti Militari cross</span>
				<span class='text'>He returned to France, where he taught at the [[École Militaire]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he was a protégé of his old commander, Marshal [[Philippe Pétain]],  de Gaulle believed in the use of tanks and rapid maneuvers rather than trench warfare</span>
				<span class='text'>e Gaulle served with the [[Occupation of the Rhineland|Army of Occupation]] in the Rhineland in the mid-1920s</span>
				<span class='text'>As a ''[[commandant]]'' (&quot;major&quot;) by the late 1920s, he briefly commanded a light infantry battalion at Trier (Treves) and then served a tour of duty in Syria, then a French protectorate under a [[French Mandate of Syria and Lebanon|mandate from the League of Nations]]</span>
				<span class='text'>During the 1930s, now a lieutenant-colonel, he served as a staff officer in France</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1934 he wrote ''Vers l'Armée de Métier'' (''Toward a Professional Army''), which advocated a professional army based on mobile armored divisions</span>
				<span class='text'>Such an army would both compensate for the poor French demography, and be an efficient tool to enforce international law, particularly the [[Treaty of Versailles]], which forbade Germany from rearming</span>
				<span class='text'>He proposed mechanization of the infantry, with stress on the wholesale use of tanks</span>
				<span class='text'>Ironically the German panzer units, so effectively employed in the invasion of France in 1940, utilized similar theories, while the French dispersed and wasted their armor</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|&quot;To all Frenchmen&quot;: de Gaulle exhorting the French to resist the German occupation]]Returning to [[Bordeaux]], the temporary wartime capital, de Gaulle learned that Marshal Pétain had become Premier on 16 June 1940 and was planning to seek an [[armistice]] with [[Nazi Germany]]</span>
				<span class='text'>De Gaulle and other officers rebelled against the new French government; on the morning of 17 June, de Gaulle and a few senior French officers flew to Britain with 100,000 gold francs in secret funds provided to him by the ex-prime minister Paul Reynaud</span>
				<span class='text'>e Gaulle strongly denounced the French government's decision to seek armistice with Germany and immediately set about building the [[Free French Forces]] from the soldiers and officers deployed outside France or who had fled France with him</span>
				<span class='text'>On 18 June, de Gaulle delivered a radio address via the [[BBC Radio]] service; the talk was authorized by Churchill</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;CDG&quot;/&gt;De Gaulle's ''[[Appeal of 18 June]]'' exhorted the French people not to be demoralized and to continue to resist the occupation of France and work against the Pétain government that was going to sign an armistice with Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>After the armistice was signed on 21 June 1940, Premier Pétain moved the government to Vichy, had the National Assembly vote to dissolve itself and give him dictatorial powers, making the beginning of Marshal Pétain's ''Révolution nationale'' (National Revolution) intended to &quot;reorient&quot; French society</span>
				<span class='text'>This was the dawning of the collaborationist [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the original broadcast could only be heard in a few parts of occupied France, de Gaulle's subsequent speeches reached many parts of the territories under the Vichy regime, helping to rally the French resistance movement and earning him much popularity amongst the French people and soldiers</span>
				<span class='text'>At a court-martial by Vichy, on 2 August 1940, de Gaulle was condemned to death for treason</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1:244&lt;/ref&gt;De Gaulle made his headquarters at [[Carlton House Terrace|Carlton Gardens]] in [[central London]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1:257–58&lt;/ref&gt; The British historian Christopher Flood noted that there were major differences between the speeches of de Gaulle and Pétain, which reflected their views on themselves and of France</span>
				<span class='text'>Pétain always used the personal pronoun ''je'', portrayed himself as both a Christ-like figure sacrificing himself for France while also assuming a God-like tone of a semi-omniscient narrator who knew truths about the world that the rest of the French did not</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; De Gaulle began by making frequent use of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;me&quot; in his war-time speeches, but over time, their use declined while de Gaulle never invoked the quasi-religious imagery around himself that Pétain used</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; De Gaulle always mentioned Pétain by name whereas Pétain never mentioned de Gaulle directly, referring to him as the &quot;''faux ami''&quot; (&quot;false friend&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Flood, Christopher &quot;Pétain and de Gaulle&quot; pages 88-110 from ''France At War In the Twentieth Century'' edited by Valerie Holman and Debra Kelly, Oxford: Berghahan Books, 2000 pages 94-95</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Pétain exonerated the French military of responsibility for the defeat of 1940 which he blamed on the moral decline of French society (thus making his ''Révolution nationale'' necessary) while de Gaulle blamed the military chiefs while exonerating French society for the defeat (thus suggesting that French society was nowhere near as rotten as Pétain claimed, making the ''Révolution nationale'' unnecessary)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Flood, Christopher &quot;Pétain and de Gaulle&quot; pages 88-110 from ''France At War In the Twentieth Century'' edited by Valerie Holman and Debra Kelly, Oxford: Berghahan Books, 2000 pagess 98 &amp; 104</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Pétain claimed that France had &quot;stupidly&quot; declared war on Germany in 1939 at British prompting while de Gaulle spoke of the entire era since 1914 as &quot;''la guerre de trente ans''&quot; (&quot;the thirty years' war&quot;), arguing the two world wars were really one with a long truce in between</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The only historical figure Pétain invoked was Jeanne d'Arc as a model of self-sacrificing French patriotism in the &quot;eternal struggle&quot; against Britain whereas de Gaulle invoked virtually every major French historical figure from the ancient Gauls to World War I</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; De Gaulle's willingness to invoke historical figures from before and after 1789 was meant to suggest that his France was an inclusive France where there was room for both left and right, in contrast to Pétain's demand for national unity under his leadership</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Most significantly, Pétain's speeches always stressed the need for France to withdraw from the world to find unity; the world outside France was always portrayed as a hostile and threatening place</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, de Gaulle's speeches while praising the greatness of France lacked Pétain's implicit xenophobia and the fight for a democratic France was always portrayed as part of a wider world-wide struggle for freedom, where a free France that would be democratic and inclusive would serve as an anchor for a new democratic order in the world</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Flood pages 88-110&quot;/&gt;De Gaulle organised the Free French Forces and the Allies gave increasing support and recognition to de Gaulle's efforts</span>
				<span class='text'>In London in September 1941 de Gaulle formed the Free French National Council, with himself as president</span>
				<span class='text'>It was an all-encompassing coalition of resistance forces, ranging from conservative Catholics like himself to Communists</span>
				<span class='text'>By early 1942, the &quot;Fighting French&quot; movement, as it was now called, gained rapidly in power and influence; it overcame Vichy in [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]], adding to its base</span>
				<span class='text'>Dealing with the French Communists was a delicate issue, for they were under Moscow's control and the USSR was friendly with Germany in 1940–41</span>
				<span class='text'>They came into the Free French movement only when [[Operation Barbarossa|Germany invaded Russia]] in June 1941</span>
				<span class='text'>De Gaulle's policy then became one of friendship directly with Moscow, but [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] showed little interest</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1:373, 462&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, de Gaulle created the [[Normandie-Niemen]] squadron, a [[Free French Air Force]] regiment, in order to fight on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Keegan298&quot;/&gt; Eisenhower was impressed by the combativeness of units of the [[Free French Forces]] and &quot;grateful for the part they had played in mopping up the remnants of German resistance&quot;; he also detected how strongly devoted many were to de Gaulle and how ready they were to accept him as the national leader</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Keegan298&quot;/&gt;===Preparations for D-Day===As preparations for the liberation of Europe gathered pace, the Americans in particular found de Gaulle's tendency to view everything from the French perspective to be extremely tiresome</span>
				<span class='text'>Roosevelt, who refused to recognize any provisional authority in France until elections had been held, referred to de Gaulle as &quot;an apprentice dictator&quot;, a view backed by a number of leading Frenchmen in Washington, including [[Jean Monnet]], who later became an instrumental figure in the setting up of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] that led to the modern [[European Union]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Roosevelt also directed Churchill to not provide de Gaulle with strategic details of the imminent invasion because he did not trust him to keep the information to himself</span>

				<span class='text'>De Gaulle was much concerned that an American takeover of the French administration would just provoke a communist uprising</span>

				<span class='text'>De Gaulle replied that he realised that this would always be the case</span>
				<span class='text'>The next day, de Gaulle refused to address the French nation because the script again made no mention of his being the legitimate interim ruler of France</span>
				<span class='text'>It instructed the French people to obey Allied military authorities until elections could be held, and so the row continued, with de Gaulle calling Churchill a &quot;gangster&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Churchill in turn accused the general of treason in the height of battle, and demanded that he be flown back to Algiers &quot;in chains if necessary&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Beevor/&gt;De Gaulle and Churchill had a complex relationship during the wartime period</span>

				<span class='text'>{when|date=December 2014}} Under the leadership of [[Jean de Lattre de Tassigny|General de Lattre de Tassigny]], France fielded an entire army – a joint force of Free French together with French colonial troops from North Africa – on the Western Front</span>
				<span class='text'>Initially landing as part of [[Operation Dragoon]], in the south of France, the [[French First Army]] helped to liberate almost one third of the country and participated in the invasion and occupation of Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>As the invasion slowly progressed and the Germans were pushed back, de Gaulle made preparations to return to France</span>

				<span class='text'>Despite an agreement that he would take only two staff, he was accompanied by a large entourage with extensive luggage, and although many rural Normans remained mistrustful of him, he was warmly greeted by the inhabitants of the towns he visited, such as the badly damaged [[Isigny-sur-Mer|Isigny]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally he arrived at the city of [[Bayeux]], which he now proclaimed as the capital of Free France</span>
				<span class='text'>Appointing his Aide-de-Camp Francois Coulet as head of the civil administration, de Gaulle returned to the UK that same night on a French destroyer, and although the official position of the supreme military command remained unchanged, local Allied officers found it more practical to deal with the fledgling administration in Bayeux in everyday matters</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Beevor/&gt;De Gaulle flew to Algiers on 16 June and then went on to Rome to meet the Pope and the new Italian government</span>
				<span class='text'>At the beginning of July he at last visited Roosevelt in Washington, where he received the 17 gun salute of a senior military leader rather than the 21 guns of a visiting head of state</span>
				<span class='text'>The visit was 'devoid of trust on both sides' according to the French representative,&lt;ref name=Fenby /&gt; however Roosevelt did make some concessions towards recognising the legitimacy of the Bayeux administration</span>
				<span class='text'>eanwhile, with the Germans retreating in the face of the Allied onslaught, harried all the way by the resistance, there were widespread instances of revenge attacks on those accused of collaboration</span>
				<span class='text'>A number of prominent officials and members of the feared [[Milice]] were murdered, often by exceptionally brutal means, provoking the Germans into appalling reprisals, such as in the destruction of the village of [[Oradour-sur-Glane]] and the killing of its 642 inhabitants</span>

				<span class='text'>&quot;The Liberation of Paris&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Liberation of the French capital was not high on the Allies' list of priorities as it had comparatively little strategic value, but both de Gaulle and the commander of the 2nd Armored Division, General [[Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque|Philippe Leclerc]] were still extremely concerned about a communist takeover</span>
				<span class='text'>De Gaulle successfully lobbied for Paris to be made a priority for liberation on humanitarian grounds and obtained from Allied Supreme Commander General [[Dwight D</span>
				<span class='text'>Eisenhower]] an agreement that French troops would be allowed to enter the capital first</span>
				<span class='text'>A few days later, General Leclerc's French Armoured Division entered the outskirts of the city, and after [[Liberation of Paris|six days of fighting]] in which the resistance played a major part, the German garrison of 5000 men surrendered on 25 August, although some sporadic outbreaks of fighting continued for several days</span>
				<span class='text'>General [[Dietrich von Choltitz]], the commander of the garrison, was instructed by Hitler to raze the city to the ground, however he simply ignored the order and surrendered his forces</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; but there were serious concerns that communist elements of the resistance, which had done so much to clear the way for the military would try to seize the opportunity to proclaim their own 'Peoples' Government' in the capital</span>
				<span class='text'>De Gaulle made contact with Leclerc and demanded the presence of the 2nd Armoured Division to accompany him on a massed parade down the [[Champs Elysees]], &quot;as much for prestige as for security&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Second World War 1966&quot;/&gt; This was in spite of the fact that Leclerc's unit was fighting as part of the American 1st Army and were under strict orders to continue their next objective without obeying orders from anyone else</span>
				<span class='text'>In the event, the American General [[Omar Bradley]] decided that Leclerc's division would be indispensable for the maintenance of order and the liquidation of the last pockets of resistance in the French capital</span>
				<span class='text'>Earlier, on 21 August, de Gaulle had appointed his military advisor General [[Marie-Pierre Koenig]] as Governor of Paris</span>

				<span class='text'>Despite their decisive support in backing him against Giraud, de Gaulle disappointed some of the Resistance leaders by telling them that although their efforts and sacrifices had been recognised, they had no further role to play and, that unless they joined the regular army, they should lay down their arms and return to civilian life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Werth /&gt;Believing them to be a dangerous revolutionary force, de Gaulle moved to break up the liberation committees and other militias</span>
				<span class='text'>Much as he feared, the communists were not only extremely active, but they received a disturbing amount of support from the population</span>
				<span class='text'>As early as May 1943, the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Secretary of State [[Cordell Hull]] had written to Roosevelt urging him to take action to attempt to curb the rise of communism in France</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Schoenbrun /&gt;===The Provisional Government of the French Republic===On 10 September 1944 the Provisional Government of the French Republic, or Government of National Unanimity formed</span>
				<span class='text'>It included many of de Gaulle's Free French associates such as [[Gaston Palewski]], Claude Guy, [[Claude Mauriac]] and [[Jacques Soustelle]], together with members of the main parties, which included the Socialists and a new Christian Democratic Party, the MRP under the leadership of Georges Bidault, who served as Foreign Minister</span>
				<span class='text'>The president of the prewar Senate [[Jules Jeanneney]] was brought back as second-ranking member, but because of their links with Russia, de Gaulle allowed the Communists only two minor positions in his government</span>
				<span class='text'>While they were now a major political force with over a million members, of the full cabinet of 22 men, only Augustin Laurent and [[Charles Tillon]]—who as head of [[Francs-Tireurs et Partisans]] had been one of the most active members of the resistance—were given ministries</span>
				<span class='text'>However, de Gaulle did pardon the Communists' leader [[Maurice Thorez]], who had been sentenced to death ''in absentia'' by the French government for desertion</span>
				<span class='text'>On his return home from Russia, Thorez delivered a speech supporting de Gaulle in which he said that for the present, the war against Germany was the only task that mattered</span>
				<span class='text'>here were also a number of new faces in the government, including a literary academic, [[Georges Pompidou]], who had written to one of de Gaulle's recruiting agents offering his services, and Jean Monnet, who in spite of his past opposition to the General now recognized the need for unity and served as Commissoner for Economic Planning</span>
				<span class='text'>Of equal rank to ministers and answerable only to the prime minister, a number of Commissioners of the Republic (Commissaires de la République) were appointed to re-establish the democratic institutions of France and to extend the legitimacy of the provisional government</span>
				<span class='text'>A number of former Free French associates served as commissioners, including [[Henri Fréville]], [[Raymond Aubrac]] and [[Michel Debré]], who was charged with reforming the civil service</span>
				<span class='text'>Controversially, de Gaulle also appointed [[Maurice Papon]] as Commissioner for Aquitaine in spite of his involvement in the deportation of Jews while serving as a senior police official in the Vichy regime during the occupation</span>
				<span class='text'>(Over the years, Papon remained in high official positions but continued to be implicated in controversial events such as the [[Paris Massacre of 1961]],&lt;ref&gt;''Daily Mail'', 22 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; eventually being convicted of crimes against humanity in 1998</span>
				<span class='text'>In social policy, legislation was introduced{{by whom|date=January 2016}} in February 1945 that provided for the establishment of works committees in all private industrial establishments employing more than 50 (originally more than 100) people</span>

				<span class='text'> Aylesbury and Slough&lt;/ref&gt;===Tour of major cities===De Gaulle's policy was to postpone elections as long as 2</span>
				<span class='text'> million French were in Germany as prisoners of war and forced laborers</span>
				<span class='text'>In mid-September, he embarked upon a tour of major provincial cities to increase his public profile and to help cement his position</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he received a largely positive reception from the crowds who came out to see him, he reflected that only a few months previously the very same people had come out to cheer Marshal Pétain when he was serving the Vichy regime</span>
				<span class='text'>Raymond Aubrac said that the General showed himself to be ill-at-ease at social functions; in [[Marseille]] and [[Lyon]] he became irate when he had to sit next to former Resistance leaders and also voiced his distaste for the rowdy, libidinous behavior of French youths during the [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquisard]] parades which preceded his speech</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Werth /&gt; When he reached [[Toulouse]], de Gaulle also had to confront the leaders of a group which had proclaimed themselves to be the provincial government of the city</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Fenby /&gt;During the tour, de Gaulle showed his customary lack of concern for his own safety by mixing with the crowds and thus making himself an easy target for an assassin</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he was naturally shy, the good use of amplification and patriotic music enabled him to deliver his message that though all of France was fragmented and suffering, together they would rise again</span>
				<span class='text'>During every speech he would stop halfway through to invite the crowd to join him in singing ''La Marseillaise'', before continuing and finishing by raising his hands in the air and crying &quot;Vive la France!&quot;&lt;ref name=Werth /&gt;===The legal purges (Épuration légale)===As the war entered the final stages, the nation was forced to confront the reality of how many of its people had behaved under German rule</span>
				<span class='text'>In France, collaborators were more severely punished than in most other occupied countries</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;&gt;Perry, K</span>
				<span class='text'>(1976) ''Modern European History'', WH Allen, ISBN 0750604824&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after the liberation, countless women accused of aiding, abetting, and taking German soldiers as lovers were subjected to public humiliations such as being shaved bald and paraded through the streets in their underwear</span>
				<span class='text'>Women who got this treatment were lucky as many others were simply attacked by lynch mobs</span>
				<span class='text'>With so many of their former members having been hunted down and killed by the Nazis and paramilitary Milice, the Partisans had already summarily executed an estimated 4,500 people,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt; and the Communists in particular continued to press for severe action against collaborators</span>
				<span class='text'>In Paris alone, over 150,000 people were at some time detained on suspicion of collaboration, although most were later released</span>
				<span class='text'>Famous figures accused included the industrialist [[Louis Renault (industrialist)|Louis Renault]], the actress [[Arletty]], who had lived openly with a German officer in [[Hôtel Ritz Paris|the Ritz]], the opera star [[Tino Rossi]], the chanteuse [[Édith Piaf]], the stage actor [[Sacha Guitry]] and [[Coco Chanel]], who was briefly detained but fled to [[Switzerland]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Fenby /&gt;Keenly aware of the need to seize the initiative and to get the process under firm judicial control, de Gaulle appointed Justice Minister [[François de Menthon]] to lead the Legal Purge ([[Épuration légale]]) to punish traitors and to clear away the traces of the Vichy regime</span>
				<span class='text'>Knowing that he would need to reprieve many of the 'economic collaborators'—such as police and civil servants who held minor roles under Vichy in order to keep the country running as normally as possible—he assumed, as head of state, the right to commute death sentences</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Fenby /&gt; In all, of the near 2,000 people who received the death sentence from the courts, fewer than 800 were actually executed</span>
				<span class='text'>De Gaulle commuted 998 of the 1,554 capital sentences submitted before him, including all those involving women</span>
				<span class='text'>Many others were given jail terms or had their voting rights and other legal privileges taken away</span>
				<span class='text'>It is generally agreed that the purges were conducted arbitrarily, with often absurdly severe or overly lenient punishments being handed down</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Werth /&gt; It was also notable that the less well-off people who were unable to pay for lawyers were more harshly treated</span>
				<span class='text'>As time went by and feelings grew less intense, a number of people who had held fairly senior positions under the Vichy government—such as Maurice Papon and [[René Bousquet]]—escaped justice by claiming to have worked secretly for the resistance or to have played a double game, working for the good of France by serving the established order</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Werth /&gt;Later, there was the question of what to do with the former Vichy leaders when they were finally returned to France</span>
				<span class='text'>Marshal Pétain and [[Maxime Weygand]] were war heroes from World War I and were now extremely old; convicted of treason, Pétain received a death sentence which his old protégé de Gaulle commuted to life imprisonment, while Weygand was eventually acquitted</span>
				<span class='text'>Three Vichy leaders were executed</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Joseph Darnand]], who became an SS officer and led the Milice paramilitaries who hunted down members of the Resistance, was executed in October 1945</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Fernand de Brinon]], the third-ranking Vichy official was found guilty of war crimes and executed in April 1947</span>
				<span class='text'>The two trials of the most infamous collaborator of all, [[Pierre Laval]], who was heavily implicated in the murder of Jews, were widely criticised as being unfair for depriving him of the opportunity to properly defend himself, although Laval antagonized the court throughout with his bizarre behavior</span>
				<span class='text'>He was found guilty of treason in May 1945 and de Gaulle was adamant that there would be no commuting the death sentence, saying that Laval's execution was &quot;an indispensable symbolic gesture required for reasons of state&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>There was a widespread belief, particularly in the years that followed, that de Gaulle was trying to appease both the Third Republic politicians and the former Vichy leaders who had made Laval their scapegoat</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Werth /&gt;===Winter of 1944===The winter of 1944{{ndash}}45 was especially difficult for most of the population</span>
				<span class='text'>Inflation showed no sign of slowing down and food shortages were severe</span>
				<span class='text'>The prime minister and the other Gaullists were forced to try to balance the desires of ordinary people and public servants for a return to normal life with pressure from Bidault's MRP and the Communists for the large scale nationalisation programme and other social changes that formed the main tenets of the CNR Charter</span>
				<span class='text'>At end of 1944 the coal industry and other energy companies were nationalised, followed shortly afterwards by major banks and finance houses, the merchant navy, the main aircraft manufacturers, airlines and a number of major private enterprises such as the [[Renault]] car company at [[Boulogne-Billancourt]], whose owner had been implicated as a collaborator and accused of having made huge profits working for the Nazis</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Fenby /&gt; In some cases unions, feeling that things were not progressing quickly enough took matters into their own hands, occupying premises and setting up workers committees to run the companies</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Werth /&gt; Women were also allowed the vote for the first time, a new social security system was introduced to cover most medical costs, unions were expanded and price controls introduced to try to curb inflation</span>
				<span class='text'>At de Gaulle's request, the newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'' was founded in December 1944 to provide France with a quality daily journal similar to those in other countries</span>
				<span class='text'>''Le Monde'' took over the premises and facilities of the older ''[[Le Temps (Paris)|Le Temps]]'', whose independence and reputation had been badly compromised during the Vichy years</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Fenby /&gt;During this period there were a number of minor disagreements between the French and the other Allies</span>
				<span class='text'>The British ambassador to France [[Duff Cooper, 1st Viscount Norwich|Duff Cooper]] said that during this time de Gaulle seemed to seek out real or imagined insults to take offense at wherever possible</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Fenby /&gt; De Gaulle believed that Britain and America were intending to keep their armies in France after the war and were secretly working to take over its overseas possessions and to prevent its from regaining its political and economic strength</span>
				<span class='text'>In late October he complained that the Allies were failing to adequately arm and equip the new French army and instructed Bidault to use the French veto at the European Council</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Fenby /&gt;On Armistice Day in 1945, Winston Churchill made his first visit to France since the liberation and received a good reception in Paris where he laid a wreath to [[Georges Clemenceau]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The occasion also marked the first official appearance of de Gaulle's wife Yvonne, but the visit was less friendly than it appeared</span>
				<span class='text'>De Gaulle had instructed that there be no excessive displays of public affection towards Churchill and no official awards without his prior agreement</span>
				<span class='text'>When crowds cheered Churchill during a parade down the Elysee, de Gaulle was heard to remark, &quot;Fools and cretins! Look at the rabble cheering the old bandit&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Werth /&gt;===Visit to the Soviet Union===With the Russian forces making more rapid advances into German-held territory than the Allies, there was a sudden public realisation that the Soviet Union was about to dominate large parts of eastern Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>In fact, at the [[Cairo Conference (1943)|Cairo]] and [[Tehran Conference]]s in 1943 Britain and America had already agreed to allow Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary to fall under the Russian sphere of influence after the war, with shared influence in Yugoslavia</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Robottom&quot;&gt;Robottom, John (1972) ''Modern Russia'', McGraw-Hill&lt;/ref&gt; Britain was to retain hegemony over Greece, although there had been no agreement over Poland, whose eastern territories were already in Russian hands under the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] with Germany, and which retained a government in exile in London</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Robottom /&gt; De Gaulle had not been invited to any of the '[[Allies of World War II|Big Three]]' Conferences, although the decisions made by Stalin, Churchill and Roosevelt in dividing up Europe were of huge importance to France</span>
				<span class='text'>y now it was clear that although for the time being they remained allies, in the coming years the Western capitalist democracies would increasingly clash with the Communist ideology</span>
				<span class='text'>De Gaulle and his Foreign Minister Bidault stated that they were not in favour of a 'Western Bloc' that would be separate from the rest of Europe, and hoped that a resurgent France might be able to act as a 'third force' in Europe to temper the ambitions of the two emerging superpowers, America and Russia</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Schoenbrun /&gt; He began seeking an audience with Stalin to press his 'facing both ways' policy, and finally received an invitation in late 1944</span>
				<span class='text'>In his memoirs, de Gaulle devoted 24 pages to his visit to Russia, but a number of writers make the point that his version of events differs significantly from that of the Russians, of foreign news correspondents, and with their own eye-witness accounts</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Schoenbrun /&gt;&lt;ref name=Werth /&gt;De Gaulle wanted access to German coal in the [[Ruhr]] as reparations after the war, the left bank of the Rhine to be incorporated into French territory, and for the [[Oder-Neisse line]] in Poland to become Germany's official eastern border</span>
				<span class='text'>De Gaulle began by requesting that France enter into a treaty with the Soviet Union on this basis, but Stalin, who remained in constant contact with Churchill throughout the visit, said that it would be impossible to make such an agreement without the consent of Britain and America</span>
				<span class='text'>He suggested that it might be possible to add France's name to the existing [[Anglo-Soviet Agreement]] if they agreed to recognise the Soviet-backed provisional Polish government known as the [[Lublin Committee]] as rightful rulers of Poland, but de Gaulle refused on the grounds that this would be 'un-French', as it would mean it being a junior partner in an alliance</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Schoenbrun /&gt; During the visit, de Gaulle accompanied the deputy Russian leader [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] on a tour of the former battleground at [[Stalingrad]], where he was deeply moved at the scene of carnage he witnessed and surprised Molotov by referring to &quot;our joint sacrifice&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Schoenbrun /&gt;Though the treaty which was eventually signed by Bidault and Molotov carried symbolic importance in that it enabled de Gaulle to demonstrate that he was recognised as the official head of state and show that France's voice was being heard abroad, it was of little relevance to Stalin due to France's lack of real political and military power; it did not affect the outcome of the post-war settlement</span>
				<span class='text'>Stalin later commented that like Churchill and Roosevelt, he found de Gaulle to be awkward and stubborn and believed that he was 'not a complicated person' (by which he meant that he was an old-style nationalist)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Schoenbrun /&gt; Stalin also felt that he lacked realism in claiming the same rights as the major powers and did not object to Roosevelt's refusal to allow de Gaulle to attend the 'Big Three' conferences that were to come at Yalta and Potsdam</span>
				<span class='text'>==Strasbourg===At the end of 1944 French forces continued to advance as part of the American armies, but during the [[Ardennes Offensive]] there was a dispute over Eisenhower's order to French troops to evacuate [[Strasbourg]], which had just been liberated so as to straighten the defensive line against the German counterattack</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Schoenbrun /&gt; Strasbourg was an important political and psychological symbol of French sovereignty in [[Alsace and Lorraine]], and de Gaulle, saying that its loss would bring down the government, refused to allow a retreat, predicting that &quot;Strasbourg will be our Stalingrad&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Fenby /&gt; At a cabinet meeting he said that the French should be willing to die there alone if the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>pulled out its own troops</span>
				<span class='text'>Churchill backed the French, and Eisenhower was so impressed with the French resolve that he eventually left his own troops in the city even at the risk of being cut off, for which de Gaulle expressed his extreme gratitude</span>
				<span class='text'>y early 1945 it was clear that the price controls which had been introduced to control inflation had only served to boost the black market and prices continued to move ever upwards</span>
				<span class='text'>By this time the army had swelled to over 1</span>
				<span class='text'> million men and almost half of state expenditure was going to military spending</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Werth /&gt; De Gaulle was faced with his first major ministerial dispute when the very able but tough-minded economics minister [[Pierre Mendès France]] demanded a programme of severe monetary reform which was opposed by the Finance Ministry headed by [[Aimé Lepercq|Aime Lepercq]], who favoured a programme of heavy borrowing to stimulate the economy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Werth /&gt; When de Gaulle, knowing there would be little appetite for further austerity measures sided with Lepercq, Mendès France tendered his resignation, which was rejected because de Gaulle knew he needed him</span>
				<span class='text'>Lepercq was killed in a road accident a short time afterwards and was succeeded by Pleven, but when in March, Mendès France asked unsuccessfully for taxes on capital earnings and for the blocking of certain bank accounts, he again offered his resignation and it was accepted</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Werth /&gt;===The Yalta Conference===De Gaulle was never invited to the summit conferences of Allied leaders such as Yalta and Potsdam</span>
				<span class='text'>He never forgave the Big Three leaders for the neglect and continued to rage against it as having been a negative factor in European politics for the rest of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Schoenbrun /&gt;After the Rhine crossings, the French First Army captured a large section of territory in southern Germany, but although this later allowed France to play a part in the signing of the German surrender, Roosevelt in particular refused to allow any discussion about de Gaulle participating in the Big Three conferences that would shape Europe in the post war world</span>
				<span class='text'>Churchill pressed very hard for France to be included 'at the inter-allied table', but on 6 December 1944 the American president wired both Stalin and Churchill to say that de Gaulle's presence would &quot;merely introduce a complicating and undesirable factor&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Robottom /&gt; This was important because it guaranteed France a permanent seat on the [[UN Security Council]], a prestigious position that despite pressure from emerging nations it still holds today</span>
				<span class='text'>==President Truman===On his way back from Yalta, Roosevelt asked de Gaulle to meet him in Algiers for talks</span>
				<span class='text'>The General refused, believing that there was nothing more to be said, and for this he received a rebuke from [[Georges Bidault]] and from the French press, and a severely angered Roosevelt criticised de Gaulle to Congress</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon after, on 12 April 1945, Roosevelt died, and despite their uneasy relationship de Gaulle declared a week of mourning in France and forwarded an emotional and conciliatory letter to the new American president, [[Harry S</span>
				<span class='text'>Truman]], in which he said of Roosevelt, &quot;all of France loved him&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Fenby /&gt;De Gaulle's relationship with Truman was to prove just as difficult as it had been with Roosevelt</span>
				<span class='text'>With Allied forces advancing deep into Germany, another serious situation developed between American and French forces in [[Stuttgart]] and [[Karlsruhe]], when French soldiers were ordered to transfer the occupation zones to U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>troops</span>
				<span class='text'>Wishing to retain as much German territory in French hands as possible, de Gaulle ordered his troops, who were using American weapons and ammunition, to resist, and an armed confrontation seemed imminent</span>

				<span class='text'>Truman told his visitor that it was time that the French got rid of the Communist influence from its government, to which de Gaulle replied that this was France's own business</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Schoenbrun /&gt; But Truman, who admitted that his feelings towards the French were becoming 'less and less friendly', went on to say that under the circumstances, the French could not expect much economic aid and refused to accept de Gaulle's request for control of the west bank of the Rhine</span>
				<span class='text'>During the argument which followed, de Gaulle reminded Truman that the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>was using the French port of [[Noumea]] in [[New Caledonia]] as a base against the Japanese</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Schoenbrun /&gt;===Victory in Europe===When, in May 1945 the German armies surrendered to the Americans and British at Rheims, a separate armistice was signed with France in Berlin</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt; De Gaulle refused to allow any British participation in the victory parade in Paris</span>
				<span class='text'>However, among the vehicles that took part was an ambulance from the [[Hadfield-Spears Ambulance Unit]], staffed by French doctors and British nurses</span>
				<span class='text'>One of the nurses was Mary Spears, who had set up the unit and had worked almost continuously since the [[Battle of France]] with Free French forces in the Middle East, North Africa and Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>Mary's husband was General [[Edward Spears]], the British liaison to the Free French who had personally spirited de Gaulle to safety in Britain in 1940</span>
				<span class='text'>When de Gaulle saw the [[Union Flag]]s and [[Flag of France|Tricolours]] side by side on the ambulance, and heard French soldiers cheering, &quot;Voilà Spears! Vive Spears!&quot; he ordered that the unit be closed down immediately and its British staff sent home</span>
				<span class='text'>A number of French troops returned their medals in protest and Mary wrote, &quot;it is a pitiful business when a great man suddenly becomes small</span>

				<span class='text'>The French commander threatened to open fire on American troops if they tried to stop them, and an irate Truman ordered the immediate end to all arms shipments to France, and sent de Gaulle an angry letter saying that he found it unbelievable that the French could threaten to attack American troops after they had done so much to liberate France</span>

				<span class='text'>De Gaulle was disappointed in Churchill's electoral loss and wrote that it was a &quot;disgrace suddenly inflicted by the British Nation upon the great man who had so gloriously led her to salvation and victory&quot; and that Churchill's wartime actions had become &quot;inadequate in this era of mediocrity&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>De Gaulle favoured a strong executive for the nation,{{r|time19590105}} but all three of the main parties wished to severely restrict the powers of the president</span>
				<span class='text'>The Communists wanted an assembly with full constitutional powers and no time limit, whereas de Gaulle, the Socialists and the [[Popular Republican Movement]] (MRP) advocated one with a term limited to only seven months, after which the draft constitution would be submitted for another referendum</span>

				<span class='text'>The big three parties won 75% of the vote, with the Communists winning 158 seats, the MRP 152 seats, the Socialists 142 seats and the remaining seats going to the various far right parties</span>
				<span class='text'>n 13 November 1945, the new assembly unanimously elected Charles de Gaulle head of the government, but problems immediately arose when it came to selecting the cabinet, due to his unwillingness once more to allow the Communists any important ministries</span>
				<span class='text'>The Communists, now the largest party and with their charismatic leader Maurice Thorez back at the helm, were not prepared to accept this for a second time, and a furious row ensued, during which de Gaulle sent a letter of resignation to the speaker of the Assembly and declared that he was unwilling to trust a party that he considered to be an agent of a foreign power (Russia) with authority over the police and armed forces of France</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Schoenbrun /&gt;Eventually, the new cabinet was finalised on 21 November, with the Communists receiving five out of the twenty-two ministries, and although they still did not get any of the key portfolios, Thorez did manage to obtain one of the four prestigious Ministry of State posts</span>
				<span class='text'>he old provisional government ruled by decree, but de Gaulle was frustrated by the new Constituent Assembly and its &quot;regime of parties&quot; and believed that the draft constitution placed too much power in the hands of parliament with its shifting party alliances</span>
				<span class='text'>One of his ministers described him as &quot;a man equally incapable of monopolizing power as of sharing it&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>e Gaulle outlined a programme of further nationalisations and a new economic plan which were passed, but a further row came when the Communists demanded a 20% reduction in the military budget</span>
				<span class='text'>Refusing to 'rule by compromise', de Gaulle once more threatened to resign</span>
				<span class='text'>There was a general feeling that he was trying to blackmail the assembly into complete subservience by threatening to withdraw his personal prestige which he insisted was what alone kept the ruling coalition together</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Schoenbrun /&gt;Barely two months after forming the new government, de Gaulle abruptly resigned on 20 January 1946</span>
				<span class='text'>The move was called &quot;a bold and ultimately foolish political ploy&quot;, with de Gaulle hoping that as a war hero, he would be soon brought back as a more powerful executive by the French people</span>

				<span class='text'>During this period of formal retirement, however, de Gaulle maintained regular contact with past political lieutenants from wartime and ''RPF'' days, including sympathizers involved in political developments in [[French Algeria]], becoming &quot;perhaps the best-informed man in France&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{r|time19590105}}In April 1947, de Gaulle made a renewed attempt to transform the political scene by creating a ''[[Rassemblement du Peuple Français]]'' (Rally of the French People, or ''RPF''), which he hoped would be able to move above the familiar party squabbles of the parliamentary system</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite the new party's taking 40% of vote in local elections and 121 seats in 1951, lacking its own press and access to television, its support ebbed away</span>

				<span class='text'>The French fought a bitter 7½ year war (the [[First Indochina War]]) to hold onto Indochina; it was largely funded by the United States and grew increasingly unpopular, especially after the stunning defeat at the [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu]]</span>

				<span class='text'>France had carried out important work in the early development of atomic energy and in October 1945 he established the French Atomic Energy Commission [[Commissariat à l'énergie atomique]], (CEA) responsible for all scientific, commercial, and military uses of nuclear energy</span>
				<span class='text'>However, partly due to communist influences in government opposed to proliferation, research stalled and France was excluded from American, British and Canadian nuclear efforts</span>
				<span class='text'>y October 1952, Britain had become the third country—after America and the Soviet Union—to independently test and develop nuclear weapons</span>
				<span class='text'>This gave Britain the capability to launch a nuclear strike via its [[Vulcan bomber]] force and they began developing a ballistic missile program known as [[Blue Streak (missile)|Blue Streak]]</span>
				<span class='text'>s early as April 1954 while out of power, de Gaulle argued that France must have its own nuclear arsenal; at the time nuclear weapons were seen as a national status symbol and a way of maintaining international prestige with a place at the 'top table' of the United Nations</span>
				<span class='text'>Full-scale research began again in late 1954 when Prime Minister Pierre Mendès France authorized a plan to develop the atomic bomb; large deposits of [[uranium]] had been discovered near [[Limoges]] in central France, providing the researchers with an unrestricted supply of nuclear fuel</span>
				<span class='text'>France's independent [[Force de Frappe]] (strike force) came into being soon after de Gaulle's election with his authorization for the first nuclear test</span>
				<span class='text'>ith the cancellation of Blue Streak, the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>agreed to supply Britain with its [[GAM-87 Skybolt|Skybolt]] and later [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]] weapons systems, and in 1958 the two nations signed the Mutual Defence Agreement forging close links which have seen the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>and UK cooperate on nuclear security matters ever since</span>
				<span class='text'>Although at the time it was still a full member of NATO, France proceeded to develop its own independent nuclear technologies—this would enable it to become a partner in any reprisals and would give it a voice in matters of atomic control</span>

				<span class='text'>France continued to carry out tests at the Algerian site until 1966, under an agreement with the newly independent Algeria</span>
				<span class='text'>France's testing program then moved to the Mururoa and Fangataufa Atolls in the South Pacific</span>
				<span class='text'>n November 1967, an article by the French Chief of the General Staff (but inspired by de Gaulle) in the ''Revue de la Défense Nationale'' caused international consternation</span>
				<span class='text'>It was stated that French nuclear force should be capable of firing &quot;in all directions&quot;—thus including even America as a potential target</span>
				<span class='text'>This surprising statement was intended as a declaration of French national independence, and was in retaliation to a warning issued long ago by [[Dean Rusk]] that U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>

				<span class='text'>France played a key role during the early days of the organisation, providing a large military contingent and agreeing—after much soul-searching—to the participation of West German forces</span>
				<span class='text'>But after his election in 1958 Charles de Gaulle took the view that the organisation was too dominated by the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>and UK, and that America would not fulfill its promise to defend Europe in the event of a Russian invasion</span>
				<span class='text'>e Gaulle demanded political parity with Britain and America in NATO, and for its geographic coverage to be extended to include French territories abroad, including Algeria, then experiencing civil war</span>
				<span class='text'>This was not forthcoming, and so in March 1959 France, citing the need for it to maintain its own independent military strategy, withdrew its Mediterranean Fleet (ALESCMED) from NATO, and a few months later de Gaulle demanded the removal of all U</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=bbc1/&gt; De Gaulle's warm relations with Eisenhower were noticed by United States military observers at that time</span>

				<span class='text'>I will do everything I can to be helpful without being openly partisan</span>

				<span class='text'>Lieutenant General Vernon A</span>

				<span class='text'>He took me also by the elbow and, taking us a little apart, he said to Eisenhower, 'I do not know what Khrushchev is going to do, nor what is going to happen, but whatever he does, I want you to know that I am with you to the end</span>

				<span class='text'>om&lt;/ref&gt; De Gaulle was very much admired by the later President Nixon</span>
				<span class='text'>After a meeting at the [[Palace of Versailles]] just before the general left office, Nixon declared that &quot;He did not try to put on airs but an aura of majesty seemed to envelop him </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>his performance—and I do not use that word disparagingly—was breathtaking</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=Fenby /&gt; On arriving for his funeral several months later, Nixon said of him, &quot;greatness knows no national boundaries&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Time'', 23 November 1970&lt;/ref&gt;Lt</span>
				<span class='text'>General [[Vernon A</span>
				<span class='text'>Walters]], a military attaché of [[Dwight Eisenhower]] and later military attaché in France from 1967–1973, noted the strong relationship between de Gaulle and Eisenhower, de Gaulle's unconditional support of Eisenhower during the U-2 incident, and de Gaulle's strong support of [[John F</span>
				<span class='text'>Kennedy]] during the Cuban Missile Crisis</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus Walters was intensely curious as to the great contrast between de Gaulle's close relations with two United States presidents during notable [[Cold War]] crises and de Gaulle's later decision to withdraw France from NATO's military command, and Walters spoke with many close military and political aides of de Gaulle</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=j1/&gt; Walters' conclusion, based upon de Gaulle's comments to many of his aides (and to Eisenhower during a meeting at Ramboullet Castle in 1959), is that de Gaulle feared that later United States presidents after Eisenhower would not have Eisenhower's special ties to Europe and would not risk nuclear war over Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=j1/&gt; Also, de Gaulle interpreted the peaceful resolution of the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] without fighting to take back Cuba from communism a mere 90 miles from the United States as an indication that the United States might not fight for Europe's defense 3,500 miles away following Soviet aggression in Europe, but would only go to war following a nuclear strike against the United States itself</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=j1/&gt; De Gaulle told Eisenhower that France did not seek to compete with the Strategic Air Command or army of the United States, but believed that France needed a way to strike the Soviet Union</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=j1/&gt;A number of commentators have been critical of de Gaulle for his failure to prevent the massacres after Algerian independence&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot; /&gt; while others take the view that the struggle had been so long and savage that it was perhaps inevitable</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Fenby /&gt; The Australian historian [[Brian Crozier]] wrote, &quot;that he was able to part with Algeria without civil war was a great though negative achievement which in all probability would have been beyond the capacity of any other leader France possessed</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;''De Gaulle: The Statesman''</span>
				<span class='text'>Brian Crozier (Methuen)</span>
				<span class='text'>1974&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1961, when four rebel generals seized power in Algeria, he &quot;did not flinch in the face of this daunting challenge&quot;, but appeared on television in his general's uniform to forbid Frenchmen to obey the rebels' orders in an &quot;inflexible display of personal authority&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>e Gaulle was an excellent manipulator of the media, as seen in his shrewd use of television to persuade around 80% of [[Metropolitan France]] to approve the new constitution for the Fifth Republic</span>
				<span class='text'>In so doing, he refused to yield to the reasoning of his opponents who said that, if he succeeded in Algeria, he would no longer be necessary</span>
				<span class='text'>He afterwards enjoyed massive approval ratings, and once said that &quot;every Frenchman is, has been or will be Gaullist&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Debray&quot;/&gt;That de Gaulle did not necessarily reflect mainstream French public opinion with his veto was suggested by the decisive majority of French people who voted in favour of British membership when the much more conciliatory Pompidou called a referendum on the matter in 1972</span>
				<span class='text'>His early influence in setting the parameters of the EEC can still be seen today, most notably with the controversial Common Agricultural Policy</span>
				<span class='text'>ome writers take the view that Pompidou was a more progressive and influential leader than de Gaulle because, though also a Gaullist, he was less autocratic and more interested in social reforms</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richards, Denis and Quick, Anthony (1974) ''20th Century Britain''&lt;/ref&gt; Although he followed the main tenets of de Gaulle's foreign policy, he was keen to work towards warmer relations with the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>A banker by profession, Pompidou is also widely credited, as de Gaulle's prime minister from 1962–1968, with putting in place the reforms which provided the impetus for the economic growth which followed</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1968, shortly before leaving office, de Gaulle refused to devalue the Franc on grounds of national prestige, but upon taking over Pompidou reversed the decision almost straight away</span>
				<span class='text'>It was ironic, that during the financial crisis of 1968, France had to rely on American (and West German) financial aid to help shore up the economy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt; Perry has written &quot;The events of 1968 illustrated the brittleness of de Gaulle's rule</span>
				<span class='text'>That he was taken by surprise is an indictment of his rule; he was too remote from real life and had no interest in the conditions under which ordinary French people lived</span>
				<span class='text'>Problems like inadequate housing and social services had been ignored</span>
				<span class='text'>The French greeted the news of his departure with some relief as the feeling had grown that he had outlived his usefulness</span>
				<span class='text'>Perhaps he clung onto power too long, perhaps he should have retired in 1965 when he was still popular</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt;Brian Crozier has said &quot;the fame of de Gaulle outstrips his achievements, he chose to make repeated gestures of petulance and defiance that weakened the west without compensating advantages to France&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;[[Régis Debray]] called de Gaulle &quot;super-lucide&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Debray&quot;/&gt; and pointed out that virtually all of his predictions, such as the fall of communism, the reunification of Germany and the resurrection of 'old' Russia, came true after his death</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;In fact, several of de Gaulle's predictions, such as his often-repeated belief during the early cold war period that a Third World War, with its &quot;nuclear bombardments, famine, deportations&quot; was not only ineluctable, but imminent, have not yet materialized</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Debray compared him with [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]] ('the great political myth of the 19th century'), calling de Gaulle his 20th century equivalent</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;The sublime, it seems, appears in France only once a century </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Napoleon left two generations dead on battlefield</span>
				<span class='text'>De Gaulle was more sparing with other people's blood; even so, he left us, as it were, stranded, alive but dazed… A delusion, perhaps, but one that turns the world upside down: causes events and movements; divides people into supporters and adversaries; leaves traces in the form of civil and penal codes and railways, factories and institutions (the Fifth Republic has already lasted three times as long as the Empire)</span>
				<span class='text'>A statesman who gets something going, who has followers, escapes the reality of the reports and statistics and become part of imagination</span>
				<span class='text'>Napoleon and de Gaulle modified the state of things because they modified souls&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Debray&quot;/&gt; However, Debray pointed out that there is a difference between Napoleon and de Gaulle: &quot;How can the exterminator be compared with the liberator? </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>The former ran the whole enterprise into the ground, while the latter managed to save it</span>
				<span class='text'>So that to measure the rebel against the despot, the challenger against the leader, is just glaringly idiotic</span>
				<span class='text'>You simply do not put an adventurer who worked for himself or his family on the same level as a commander-in-chief serving his country</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Regrettably, Gaullism and Bonapartism have a number of features in common, but Napoleon and de Gaulle do not have the same moral value</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>the first wanted a Holy French Empire without the faith, a Europe under French occupation</span>
				<span class='text'>The second wanted to rescue the nation from the emperors and establish a free France in a free Europe&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Debray&quot;/&gt;While de Gaulle had many admirers, he was at the same time one of the most hated and reviled men in modern French history</span>
