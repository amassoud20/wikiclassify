				<span class='text'>]As Edison was expanding his [[direct current]] (DC) power delivery system he began receiving stiff competition from companies installing [[alternating current]] (AC) systems</span>
				<span class='text'>From the early 1880s on AC [[arc lamp|arc lighting]] systems for streets and large spaces had been an expanding business in the US</span>
				<span class='text'>With development of [[transformer]]s in Europe and by [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]] in the US in 1885-1886 it became possible to transmit AC very long distances over thinner and cheaper wires, and &quot;step down&quot; the voltage at the destination for distribution to users</span>
				<span class='text'>This allowed AC to be used not only in street lighting but also in lighting for small business and domestic customers, the market Edison's patented low voltage DC incandescent lamp system had been designed to supply</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jill Jonnes, Empires Of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, And The Race To Electrify The World, Random House - 2004, pages 54-60&lt;/ref&gt; Edison's DC empire began suffering from one of its chief drawbacks: it was suitable only for the high density of customers found in large cities</span>
				<span class='text'>Edison's DC plants could not deliver electricity to customers who were more than one mile from the plant and the short range left a patchwork of un-supplied customers in-between plants</span>
				<span class='text'>Small cities and rural areas could not afford an Edison style system at all</span>
				<span class='text'>This left a large part of market without electrical service and AC companies were expanding into this gap</span>
				<span class='text'>dison expressed views that AC was unworkable and the high voltages used were dangerous</span>
				<span class='text'>As [[George Westinghouse]] was installing his first AC systems in 1886, Thomas Edison began a pattern of striking out personally against his chief rival stating, &quot;''Just as certain as death, Westinghouse will kill a customer within six months after he puts in a system of any size</span>
				<span class='text'>He has got a new thing and it will require a great deal of experimenting to get it working practically</span>

				<span class='text'>One notion is that the inventor may not have been able to grasp the more abstract theories behind AC and was trying to avoid developing a system he did not understand</span>
				<span class='text'>Edison also appeared to have been worried about the high voltage from some competitor's misinstalled AC system killing customers and hurting the sales of electric power systems in general</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Empires Of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, And The Race To Electrify The By Jill Jonnes page 146&lt;/ref&gt; On top of all that was the simple fact that Edison Electric had based their entire design on low voltage DC and switching a standard after they had installed over 100 systems was, in Edison's mind, out of the question</span>
				<span class='text'>By the end of 1887 Edison Electric was beginning to lose market share with Westinghouse, who had built 68 AC-based power stations to Edison's 121 DC-based stations</span>
				<span class='text'>To make matters worse for Edison, the [[Thomson-Houston Electric Company]] of Lynn, Massachusetts (another AC-based competitor) had built 22 power stations</span>

				<span class='text'>Brown]] in a [[propaganda]] campaign, aiding Brown in the public electrocution of animals with AC as well as supported legislation to control and severely limit AC installations and voltages (to the point of making it an ineffective power delivery system) in what was now being referred to as a [[War of Currents|&quot;battle of currents&quot;]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The development of the [[electric chair]] was used in an attempt to portray AC as having a greater lethal potential than DC and [[Smear campaign|smear]] Westinghouse at the same time via Edison colluding with Brown and Westinghouse's chief AC rival, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company, to make sure the first electric chair was powered by a Westinghouse AC generator</span>
				<span class='text'>homas Edison's staunch anti-AC tactics were not sitting well with his own stock holders</span>
				<span class='text'>By the early 1890s Edison's company was generating much smaller profits than its AC rivals, and the War of Currents would come to an end in 1892 with Edison being forced out of controlling his own company</span>
				<span class='text'>That year the financier [[J P Morgan]] engineered a merger of Edison General Electric with Thomson-Houston that basically put the board of Thomson-Houston in charge of the new company called [[General Electric]] (dropping &quot;Edison&quot; from its name)</span>
				<span class='text'>General Electric now controlled three quarters of the US electrical business and would go on to compete with Westinghouse for the AC market</span>

				<span class='text'>Until Edison discovered that [[Scheelite|calcium tungstate]] fluoroscopy screens produced brighter images than the barium [[platinocyanide]] screens originally used by [[Wilhelm Röntgen]], the technology was capable of producing only very faint images</span>

				<span class='text'>With knowledge gained from years of working as a telegraph operator, he learned the basics of electricity</span>
				<span class='text'>This allowed him to make his early fortune with the [[ticker tape|stock ticker]], the first electricity-based broadcast system</span>
