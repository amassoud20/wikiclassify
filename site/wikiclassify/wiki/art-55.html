				<span class='text'>It evolved into [[Germany]] after the Carolingian eclipse</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; from 887, the disputed [[King of Italy]] from 894 and the disputed [[Holy Roman Emperor]] from 22 February 896 until his death at [[Regensburg]], [[Bavaria]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Career=====Birth and illegitimacy===Arnulf was the son of [[Carloman, King of Bavaria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg</span>

				<span class='text'>After Arnulf's birth, Carloman married, before 861, a daughter of that same Count Ernst, who died after 8 August 879</span>

				<span class='text'>tml Mediaeval Genealogy: Liutswind:] Various theories about her descent and her relation to Carloman (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;===Early years===Arnulf was granted the [[Duchy of Carinthia]], a Frankish vassal state and successor of the ancient [[Carantania|Principality of Carantania]], by his father [[Carloman of Bavaria|Carloman]], after Carloman had become reconciled with his own father [[Louis the German]] and was created [[King of Bavaria]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Arnulf spent his childhood on the ''Mosaburch'' or Mosapurc, which is widely believed to be [[Moosburg, Austria|Moosburg]] in Carinthia, only a few miles away from one of the Imperial residences, the Carolingian [[Kaiserpfalz]]  at [[Zollfeld|Karnburg]], which before as ''Krnski grad'' had been the residence of the Carantanian princes</span>
				<span class='text'>Arnulf kept his seat here and from later events it may be inferred that the Carantanians, from an early time, treated him as their own Duke</span>
				<span class='text'>Later, after he had been crowned King of East Francia, Arnulf turned his old territory of Carinthia into the [[March of Carinthia]], a part of the [[Duchy of Bavaria]]</span>
				<span class='text'>fter Carloman was incapacitated by a stroke in 879, [[Louis the Younger]] inherited Bavaria, [[Charles the Fat]] was given the [[Kingdom of Italy (Medieval)|Kingdom of Italy]] and Arnulf was confirmed in Carinthia by an agreement with Carloman</span>
				<span class='text'>Bavaria, however, was ruled more or less by Arnulf</span>

				<span class='text'>135&lt;/ref&gt; The division of the realm was confirmed in 880 on Carloman’s death</span>
				<span class='text'>hen, in 882, [[Engelschalk II]] rebelled against the [[March of Pannonia|Margrave of Pannonia]], [[Aribo of Austria|Aribo]], and ignited the so-called [[Wilhelminer War]], Arnulf supported him and even accepted his and his brother's homage</span>
				<span class='text'>This ruined Arnulf's relationship with his uncle the Emperor and put him at war with [[Svatopluk of Moravia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Pannonia]] was invaded, but Arnulf refused to give up the young Wilhelminers</span>
				<span class='text'>Arnulf did not make peace with Svatopluk until late 885, by which time the Moravian was a man of the emperor</span>
				<span class='text'>Some scholars see this war as destroying Arnulf's hopes at succeeding Charles</span>
				<span class='text'>==King of East Francia===Arnulf took the leading role in the deposition of his uncle, the [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Charles the Fat]]</span>
				<span class='text'>With the support of the nobles, Arnulf held a [[diet (assembly)|Diet]] at [[Trebur|Tribur]] and deposed Charles in November 887, under threat of military action</span>

				<span class='text'>376&quot;&gt;Mann III, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>376&lt;/ref&gt;  Charles peacefully went into his involuntary retirement, but not without first chastising his nephew for his treachery and asking only for a few royal villas in [[Swabia]], which Arnulf mercifully granted him,&lt;ref&gt;Duckett, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>12&lt;/ref&gt; on which to live out his final months</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>222&quot;&gt;Canduci, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>222&lt;/ref&gt;  Arnulf, having distinguished himself in the war against the [[Slavs]] was elected by the nobles of the realm (only the eastern realm, though Charles had ruled the whole of the Frankish lands) and assumed his title of [[List of Frankish Kings|King of East Francia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Comyn, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>80&lt;/ref&gt;Arnulf took advantage of the problems in [[West Francia]] upon the death of Charles The Fat to secure the territory of [[Lotharingia|Lorraine]], which he converted into a kingdom for his son, [[Zwentibold]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Comyn, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>82&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, in 889, Arnulf supported the claim of [[Louis the Blind]] to the kingdom of [[Provence]], after receiving a personal appeal from Louis’ mother, [[Ermengard of Provence|Ermengard]], who came to see Arnulf at [[Forchheim]] in May 889</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Mann III, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>382&lt;/ref&gt;  Recognising the superiority of Arnulf’s position, in 888 [[Odo of France]] formally admitted the suzerainty of Arnulf</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bryce, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>xxxv&quot;&gt;Bryce, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>xxxv&lt;/ref&gt;  In 893, Arnulf switched his support from Odo to [[Charles the Simple]] after being persuaded by [[Fulk (Archbishop of Reims)]] that it was in his best interests</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Mann IV, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>55&lt;/ref&gt;  Arnulf then took advantage of the fighting that followed between Odo and Charles in 894, taking territory from West Francia and transferring it to his dominion</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Mann IV, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>56&quot;&gt;Mann IV, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>56&lt;/ref&gt;  At one point, Charles was forced to flee to Arnulf and ask for his protection</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Duckett, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>25&lt;/ref&gt;  His intervention forced [[Pope Formosus]] to get involved, as he was worried that a divided and war weary West Francia would be easy prey for the Normans</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Mann IV, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>56&quot;&gt;Mann IV, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>56&lt;/ref&gt;In 895, Arnulf summoned both Charles and Odo to his presence at [[Worms, Germany|Worms]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Charles’s advisers convinced him not to go, and he sent a representative in his place</span>
				<span class='text'>Odo, on the other hand, personally attended, together with a large retinue, bearing many gifts for Arnulf</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Duckett, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>26&quot;&gt;Duckett, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>26&lt;/ref&gt;  Angered by the non-appearance of Charles, he welcomed Odo at the Diet of Worms in May 895, and again supported Odo's claim to the West Francian throne</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Duckett, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>26&quot;&gt;Duckett, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>26&lt;/ref&gt;  In this same assembly, he bestowed upon his illegitimate son [[Zwentibold]], a crown as the King of Lotharingia</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Duckett, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>26&quot;&gt;Duckett, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>26&lt;/ref&gt;Arnulf was not a negotiator, but a fighter</span>
				<span class='text'>In 890 he was successfully battling the Slavs in Pannonia</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Duckett, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>16&lt;/ref&gt; In 891, the Danes invaded [[Lotharingia]],&lt;ref&gt;Duckett, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>17&lt;/ref&gt; and crushed an East Frankish army at [[Maastricht]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Duckett, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>20&quot;&gt;Duckett, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>20&lt;/ref&gt;  At the decisive [[Battle of Leuven]] in September 891 in [[Lotharingia|Lorraine]], he repelled an invasion by the [[Normans]] (Northmen or [[Vikings]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;Duckett, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>20&quot;&gt;Duckett, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>20&lt;/ref&gt; essentially ending their invasions on that front</span>

				<span class='text'>222&quot;&gt;Canduci, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>222&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[Annales Fuldenses]]'' report that the bodies of dead Northmen blocked the run of the river</span>
				<span class='text'>After his victory, Arnulf built a new [[castle]] on an island in the [[Dijle]] river (Dutch: Dijle, English and French: Dyle)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[Latin]] ''Luvanium'', local ''Lovon''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;As early as 880, Arnulf had designs on [[Great Moravia]], and had the Frankish bishop [[Wiching]] of [[Nitra]] interfere with the missionary activities of [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Methodius]], with the aim of preventing any potential for creating a unified Moravian nation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Mann III, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>243&lt;/ref&gt;  In 893 or 894, Great Moravia probably lost a part of its territory — present-day Western [[Hungary]] — to him</span>
				<span class='text'> As a reward, Wiching became Arnulf’s [[chancellor]] in 892</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Mann, III, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>244&lt;/ref&gt;  Arnulf, however, failed to conquer the whole of Great Moravia when he attempted it in 892, 893, and 899</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet Arnulf did achieve some successes, in particular in 895, when [[Bohemia]] broke away from Great Moravia and became his vassal</span>
				<span class='text'>An accord was made between him and the [[Duke of Bohemia|Bohemian Duke]] [[Borivoj I of Bohemia|Borivoj I]] (reigned 870-95); Bohemia was thus freed from the dangers of invasion</span>
				<span class='text'>However, in his attempts to conquer Moravia, in 899 Arnulf invited across the [[Magyars]] who had settled in [[Pannonia]], and with their help he imposed a measure of control on Moravia</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Comyn, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>83&quot;&gt;Comyn, pg</span>

				<span class='text'>83&quot;&gt;Comyn, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mann IV, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>13&lt;/ref&gt;Like all early Germanic rulers, he was heavily involved in [[ecclesiastical]] disputes; in 895, at the Diet of Tribur, he presided over a dispute between the [[Episcopal see]]s of [[Bremen]], [[Hamburg]] and [[Cologne]] over jurisdictional authority, which saw [[Hamburg-Bremen|Bremen and Hamburg]] remain a combined see, independent of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cologne|see of Cologne]]</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|230px|Arnulf of Carinthia, 13c picture]]In Italy, the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]] was being fought over between [[Guy III of Spoleto]] and [[Berengar of Friuli]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Berengar had been crowned king in 887, but Guy was in his turn crowned in 889</span>
				<span class='text'>While [[Pope Stephen V]] supported Guy, crowning him [[Holy Roman Emperor|Roman Emperor]] in 891, Arnulf threw his support behind Berengar</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Mann III, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>378&lt;/ref&gt;In 893, a new pope, [[Pope Formosus|Formosus]], not trusting the newly crowned co-emperors [[Guy III of Spoleto|Guy]] and [[Lambert II of Spoleto|Lambert]], sent an embassy to Omuntesberch, where Arnulf was holding a Diet with Svatopluk,&lt;ref&gt;Mann III, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>379&lt;/ref&gt; to request Arnulf come and liberate [[Italy]],&lt;ref&gt;Mann IV, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>50&lt;/ref&gt; where he would be crowned in [[Rome]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Arnulf met the ''Primores'' of the Kingdom of Italy, dismissed them with gifts and promised to enter Italy</span>

				<span class='text'>51&quot;&gt;Mann IV, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>51&lt;/ref&gt;  Arnulf sent his son [[Zwentibold]] with a Bavarian army to join [[Berengar of Friuli]]</span>
				<span class='text'>They defeated Guy, but were bought off and left in autumn</span>
				<span class='text'>Arnulf then personally led an army across the [[Alps]] early in 894</span>
				<span class='text'>In January 894 [[Bergamo]] fell, and Count Ambrose, Guy’s representative in the city, was hung from a tree by the city’s gate</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Duckett, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>22&quot;/&gt;Conquering all of the territory north of the [[Po River|Po]], he forced the surrender of [[Milan]] and then drove Guy out of [[Pavia]], where he was crowned [[King of Italy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Bryce, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>xxxv&quot;/&gt; but went no further before Guy died suddenly in late autumn, and fever incapacitated his troops</span>

				<span class='text'>51&quot;&gt;Mann IV, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>51&lt;/ref&gt; His march northward through the [[Alps]] was interrupted by Rudolph, King of Transjurane Burgundy, and it was only with great difficulty that Arnulf crossed the mountain range</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Duckett, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>22&quot;&gt;Duckett, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>22&lt;/ref&gt;  In retaliation, Arnulf ordered his illegitimate son [[Zwentibold]] to ravage [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Duckett, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>22&quot;&gt;Duckett, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>22&lt;/ref&gt;  In the meantime, Lambert and his mother [[Ageltrude]] travelled to Rome to receive papal confirmation of his imperial succession, but Formosus, still desiring to crown Arnulf, was imprisoned in [[Castel Sant'Angelo]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n September 895, a new embassy arrived in [[Regensburg]] beseeching Arnulf's aid</span>
				<span class='text'>In October, Arnulf undertook his second campaign into Italy</span>

				<span class='text'>51&quot;&gt;Mann IV, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>51&lt;/ref&gt;  He crossed the Alps quickly and took [[Pavia]], but then he continued slowly, garnering support among the nobility of [[Tuscany]]</span>
				<span class='text'>First [[Maginulf, Count of Milan]], and then [[Walfred, Count of Pavia]], joined him</span>
				<span class='text'>Eventually even the [[Adalbert II of Tuscany|Margrave Adalbert II]] abandoned Lambert</span>

				<span class='text'>52&quot;&gt;Mann IV, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>52&lt;/ref&gt;  Arnulf was greeted at the [[Ponte Milvio]] by the [[Roman Senate]] who escorted him into the [[Leonine City]], where he was received by Pope Formosus on the steps of the [[Church of the Holy Apostles|Santi Apostoli]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Mann IV, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>52&quot;&gt;Mann IV, pg</span>

				<span class='text'>52&lt;/ref&gt; who swore “never to hand over the city to Lambert or his mother Ageltrude”</span>

				<span class='text'>53&quot;&gt;Mann IV, pg</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Duckett, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>28&lt;/ref&gt;  Leaving one of his vassals, Farold, to hold Rome, Arnulf marched on [[Spoleto]], where Ageltrude had fled to join Lambert</span>

				<span class='text'>53&quot;&gt;Mann IV, pg</span>
