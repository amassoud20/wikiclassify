				<span class='text'>Hütter, who left the band for eight months, he played synthesizer, keyboards (including Farfisa organ and electric piano)</span>
				<span class='text'>heir first three albums were free-form experimental rock without the pop hooks or the more disciplined song structure of later work</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[Kraftwerk (album)|Kraftwerk]]'', released in 1970, and ''[[Kraftwerk 2]]'', released in 1972, were mostly exploratory jam music, played on a variety of traditional instruments including guitar, bass, drums, organ, flute and violin</span>
				<span class='text'>Post-production modifications to these recordings were used to distort the sound of the instruments, particularly audio-tape manipulation and multiple dubbings of one instrument on the same track</span>
				<span class='text'>Both albums are purely instrumental</span>
				<span class='text'>Live performances from 1972 to 1973 were made as a duo, using a simple beat-box-type electronic [[drum machine]], with preset rhythms taken from an electric organ</span>
				<span class='text'>These shows were mainly in Germany, with occasional shows in France</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bussy&quot; /&gt; Later in 1973, [[Wolfgang Flür]] joined the group for rehearsals, and the unit performed as a trio on the television show ''Aspekte'' for German television network [[ZDF]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Although almost entirely instrumental, the album marks Kraftwerk's first use of the [[vocoder]], which would in time become one of its musical signatures</span>
				<span class='text'>Kraftwerk's futuristic and robotic sound was influenced by the 'adrenalized insurgency' of Detroit artists of the late '60s such as [[MC5]] and [[the Stooges]]</span>

				<span class='text'>As a result of his work with Kraftwerk, Plank's studio near [[Cologne]] became one of the most sought-after studios in the late 1970s</span>
				<span class='text'>Plank co-produced the first four Kraftwerk albums</span>

				<span class='text'>Hütter and Schneider had invested in newer technology such as the [[Minimoog]] and the [[EMS Synthi AKS]], helping give Kraftwerk a newer, disciplined sound</span>
				<span class='text'>''Autobahn'' would also be the last album that [[Conny Plank]] would engineer</span>

				<span class='text'>This meant they no longer had to rely on outside producers</span>
				<span class='text'>At this time the painter and graphic artist [[Emil Schult]] became a regular collaborator  working in support of the band</span>
				<span class='text'>Schult designed artwork in addition to later co-writing lyrics and accompanying the group on tour</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bussy&quot; /&gt;The year 1975 saw a turning point in Kraftwerk's live shows</span>
				<span class='text'>With financial support from [[Phonogram Records|Phonogram]] in the US, it was able to undertake a multi-date tour to promote the ''Autobahn'' album</span>
				<span class='text'>This tour took them to the US, Canada and the UK for the first time</span>
				<span class='text'>The tour also saw a new, stable, live line-up in the form of a quartet</span>
				<span class='text'>Hütter and Schneider both mainly played keyboard parts on synthesizers such as the [[Minimoog]] and [[ARP Odyssey]], with Schneider's use of flute diminishing</span>
				<span class='text'>The pair also sang vocals on stage for the first time, with Schneider also using a vocoder live</span>
				<span class='text'>Wolfgang Flür and new recruit [[Karl Bartos]] performed live on self-made electronic percussions</span>
				<span class='text'>Bartos also used a Deagan [[Vibraphone]] on stage</span>
				<span class='text'>The Hütter-Schneider-Bartos-Flür formation remained in place until the late 1980s and is now regarded as the classic live line-up of Kraftwerk</span>
				<span class='text'>Emil Schult generally fulfilled the role of tour manager</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bussy&quot; /&gt;After the 1975 ''Autobahn'' tour, Kraftwerk began work on a follow-up album, ''[[Radio-Activity]]'' (German title: ''Radio-Aktivität'')</span>
				<span class='text'>After further investment in new equipment, the [[Kling Klang Studio]] became a fully working recording studio</span>
				<span class='text'> It was decided that the new album would have a central theme</span>
				<span class='text'>This theme came from Kraftwerk's shared interest in radio communication, which had become enhanced on their last tour of the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>While Emil Schult began working on artwork and lyrics for the new album, Kraftwerk began to work on the music</span>
				<span class='text'>''Radio-Activity'' was less successful in the UK and American markets, but it did open up the European market for Kraftwerk, gaining them a [[gold disc]] in France</span>
				<span class='text'>Kraftwerk produced some promotional videos and performed several European live dates to promote the album</span>
				<span class='text'>With the release of ''Autobahn'' and ''Radio-Activity'', Kraftwerk had left behind its avant-garde experimentations and had moved forward towards electronic pop tunes</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bussy&quot; /&gt;In 1976, Kraftwerk went out on tour in support of the ''Radio-Activity'' album</span>
				<span class='text'>Enthused by the album, British singer [[David Bowie]] had invited the band to support him on his ''[[Station to Station]]'' tour but they declined</span>

				<span class='text'>==''Trans-Europe Express'', ''The Man-Machine'' and ''Computer World'' (1977–82)===After having finished the Radio-Activity tour Kraftwerk began recording ''[[Trans-Europe Express (album)|Trans-Europe Express]]'' (German: ''Trans-Europa Express'') at the Kling Klang Studio</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bussy&quot; /&gt; ''Trans-Europe Express'' was mixed at the [[Record Plant Studios]] in Los Angeles</span>
				<span class='text'>It was around this time that Hütter and Schneider met David Bowie at the Kling Klang Studio</span>
				<span class='text'>A collaboration was mentioned in an interview ([[Brian Eno]]) with Hütter, but it never materialised</span>
				<span class='text'>The release of ''Trans-Europe Express'' was marked with an extravagant train journey used as a press conference by EMI France</span>
				<span class='text'>The album was released in March 1977</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bussy&quot; /&gt; The album won a disco award in New York later that year</span>
				<span class='text'>n May 1978 Kraftwerk released ''[[The Man-Machine]]'' (German: ''Die Mensch-Maschine''), recorded at the Kling Klang Studio</span>
				<span class='text'>Due to the complexity of the recording the album was mixed at Studio Rudas in Düsseldorf</span>
				<span class='text'>The band hired sound engineer Leanard Jackson from Detroit to work together with Joschko Rudas on the final mix of the record</span>
				<span class='text'>''The Man-Machine'' was the first Kraftwerk album where [[Karl Bartos]] was co-credited as a songwriter</span>
				<span class='text'>The cover was produced in black, white and red; the artwork was inspired by Russian artist [[El Lissitzky]] and the [[Suprematism]] movement</span>
				<span class='text'>The image of the band on the front cover was photographed by Gunther Frohling</span>
				<span class='text'>This showed the band dressed in red shirts and black ties</span>
				<span class='text'>Kraftwerk would not issue an album for another three years</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bussy&quot; /&gt;In May 1981 Kraftwerk put out ''[[Computer World]]'' (German: ''Computerwelt'') on EMI records</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bussy&quot; /&gt; It was recorded at Kling Klang Studio between 1978 and 1981</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bussy&quot; /&gt; A lot of this time was spent modifying the studio so the band could take it on tour with them</span>

				<span class='text'>om| accessdate=2013-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band's live set focused increasingly on song-based material, with greater use of vocals and the use of sequencing equipment for percussion and musical lines</span>
				<span class='text'>The approach taken by the group was to use the sequencing equipment interactively, thus allowing room for improvisation</span>
				<span class='text'>Ironically Kraftwerk did not own a computer at the time of recording ''Computer World''</span>
				<span class='text'>raftwerk returned to the live scene with the ''Computer World'' tour of 1981, where the band effectively packed up its entire Kling Klang studio and took it along on the road</span>
				<span class='text'>The band also developed an increasing use of visual elements in the live shows</span>
				<span class='text'>This included back-projected slides and films, increasingly synchronised with the music as the technology developed, the use of hand-held miniaturised instruments during the set (for example, during &quot;Pocket Calculator&quot;), and, perhaps most famously, the use of replica [[mannequin]]s of themselves to perform on stage during the song &quot;The Robots&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>==''Tour de France'' and ''Electric Café'' (1983–89)===In 1982 Kraftwerk began to work on a new album that initially had the working title ''[[Technicolor]]'' but due to trademark issues was changed to ''[[Techno Pop]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>One of the songs from these recording sessions was &quot;[[Tour de France (song)|Tour de France]]&quot;, which [[EMI]] released as a single in 1983</span>
				<span class='text'>This song was a reflection of the band's new-found obsession for cycling</span>
				<span class='text'>After the physically demanding ''Computer World'' tour, Ralf Hütter had been looking for forms of exercise that fitted in with the image of Kraftwerk; subsequently he encouraged the group to become vegetarians and take up cycling</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Tour de France&quot; included sounds that followed this theme including bicycle chains, gear mechanisms and the breathing of the cyclist</span>
				<span class='text'>At the time of the single's release Ralf Hütter tried to persuade the rest of the band that they should record a whole album based on cycling</span>
				<span class='text'>The other members of the band were not convinced, and the theme was left to the single alone</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bussy&quot; /&gt; &quot;Tour de France&quot; was released in German and French</span>
				<span class='text'>The vocals of the song were recorded on the Kling Klang Studio stairs to create the right atmosphere</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bussy&quot; /&gt; &quot;Tour de France&quot; was featured in the 1984 film ''[[Breakin']]'', showing the influence that Kraftwerk had on black American dance music</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bussy&quot; /&gt;During the recording of &quot;Tour de France&quot;, Ralf Hütter was involved in a serious cycling accident</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bussy&quot; /&gt; He suffered head injuries and remained in a coma for several days</span>
				<span class='text'>uring 1983 Wolfgang Flür was beginning to spend less time in the studio</span>
				<span class='text'>Since the band began using sequencers his role as a drummer was becoming less frequent</span>
				<span class='text'>He preferred to spend his time travelling with his girlfriend</span>
				<span class='text'>Flür was also experiencing artistic difficulties with the band</span>
				<span class='text'>After his final work on the 1986 album ''[[Electric Café]]'' (a</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>''[[Techno Pop]])'' he hardly returned to the Kling Klang Studio</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;iwasarobot&quot; /&gt; Wolfgang Flür left the band in 1987 and was replaced by [[Fritz Hilpert]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==''The Mix'' (1990–99)===After years of withdrawal from live performance Kraftwerk began to tour Europe more frequently</span>
				<span class='text'>In February 1990 the band played a few secret shows in Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>Karl Bartos left the band shortly afterwards</span>
				<span class='text'>The next proper tour was in 1991, for the album ''The Mix''</span>
				<span class='text'>Hütter and Schneider wished to continue the synth-pop quartet style of presentation, and recruited [[Fernando Abrantes]] as a replacement for Bartos</span>
				<span class='text'>Abrantes left the band shortly after though</span>
				<span class='text'>In late 1991, long-time Kling Klang Studio sound engineer [[Henning Schmitz]] was brought in to finish the remainder of the tour and to complete a new version of the quartet that remained active until 2008</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1997 they had a famous appearance at dance festival [[Tribal Gathering]] held in England</span>

				<span class='text'>In January and February 2003, prior to the release of the album, the band started the extensive ''Minimum-Maximum'' world tour, using four customised [[Sony]] [[VAIO]] laptop computers, effectively leaving the entire Kling Klang studio at home in Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>The group also obtained a new set of transparent video panels to replace its four large projection screens</span>
				<span class='text'>This greatly streamlined the running of all of the group's sequencing, sound-generating, and visual-display software</span>
				<span class='text'>From this point, the band's equipment increasingly reduced manual playing, replacing it with interactive control of sequencing equipment</span>
				<span class='text'>Hütter retains the most manual performance, still playing musical lines by hand on a controller keyboard and singing live vocals and having a repeating [[ostinato]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Schneider's live vocoding has been replaced by software-controlled speech-synthesis techniques</span>
				<span class='text'>In November, the group made a surprising appearance at the MTV European Music Awards in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, performing &quot;Aerodynamik&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The same year a promotional box set entitled ''12345678'' (subtitled ''The Catalogue'') was issued, with plans for a proper commercial release to follow</span>
				<span class='text'> The box featured [[Audio mastering|remastered]] editions of the group's core eight studio albums, from ''Autobahn'' to ''Tour de France Soundtracks''</span>
				<span class='text'>This long-awaited box-set would eventually be released in a different set of remasters in November 2009</span>
				<span class='text'>n June 2005 the band's first-ever official live album, ''[[Minimum-Maximum]]'', which was compiled from the shows during the band's tour of spring 2004, received extremely positive reviews</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;taylor&quot; /&gt; The album contained reworked tracks from existing studio albums</span>
				<span class='text'>This included a track titled &quot;Planet of Visions&quot; that was a reworking of &quot;Expo 2000&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>In support of this release, Kraftwerk made another quick sweep around the Balkans with dates in [[Serbia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Turkey]], and Greece</span>
				<span class='text'>In December, the [[Minimum-Maximum (video)|DVD release]] of ''Minimum-Maximum'' was made available</span>
				<span class='text'>During 2006, the band performed at festivals in Norway, the Czech Republic, Spain, Belgium and Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>n April 2008 the group played three shows in US cities [[Minneapolis]], [[Milwaukee]], and [[Denver]], and was a co-headliner at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This was their second appearance at the festival since 2004</span>
				<span class='text'>Further shows were performed in Ireland, Poland, [[Ukraine]], Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Singapore later that year</span>
				<span class='text'>The touring quartet consisted of Ralf Hütter, [[Henning Schmitz]], [[Fritz Hilpert]], and video technician Stefan Pfaffe, who became an official member in 2008</span>
				<span class='text'>Original member Florian Schneider was absent from the lineup</span>
				<span class='text'>Hütter stated that he was working on other projects</span>
