				<span class='text'>Schubert died before his 32nd birthday, but was extremely prolific during his lifetime</span>
				<span class='text'>His output consists of over six hundred [[Secular music|secular]] vocal works (mainly [[Lied]]er), seven complete [[symphonies]], sacred music, [[opera]]s, [[incidental music]] and a large body of chamber and piano music</span>
				<span class='text'>Appreciation of his music while he was alive was limited to a relatively small circle of admirers in Vienna, but interest in his work increased significantly in the decades following his death</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Felix Mendelssohn]], [[Robert Schumann]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Johannes Brahms]] and other 19th-century composers discovered and championed his works</span>
				<span class='text'>Today, Schubert is ranked among the greatest composers of the late [[Classical period (music)|Classical]] and early [[Romantic music|Romantic]] eras and is one of the most frequently performed composers of the early nineteenth century</span>
				<span class='text'>= Biography ===== Early life and education ===Schubert was born in [[Alsergrund#District sections|Himmelpfortgrund]] (now a part of [[Alsergrund]]), Vienna, [[Archduchy of Austria]] on 31 January 1797</span>
				<span class='text'>His father, Franz Theodor Schubert, the son of a [[Moravia]]n [[peasant]], was a parish [[schoolmaster]]; his mother, Elisabeth (Vietz), was the daughter of a [[Silesia]]n master [[locksmith]] and had been a housemaid for a Viennese family before marriage</span>
				<span class='text'>Of Franz Theodor's fourteen children (one of them illegitimate, born in 1783),&lt;ref&gt;[[Rita Steblin]], &quot;Franz Schubert – das dreizehnte Kind&quot;, ''Wiener Geschichtsblätter'', 3/2001, 245–265</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; nine died in infancy</span>
				<span class='text'>heir father was a well-known teacher, and his school in [[Lichtental]] (in Vienna's [[Alsergrund|ninth district]]) had numerous students in attendance</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;KreissleWilber2&quot;&gt;[[#Wilberforce|Wilberforce (1866)]], p</span>
				<span class='text'>2: &quot;the school was much frequented&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Though he was not recognized or even formally trained as a musician, he passed on certain musical basics to his gifted son</span>

				<span class='text'>His formal musical education started around the same time</span>
				<span class='text'>His father taught him basic violin technique,&lt;ref name=&quot;Duncan3&quot;/&gt; and his brother Ignaz gave him piano lessons</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;GibbsLife25&quot;&gt;[[#GibbsLife|Gibbs (2000)]], p</span>
				<span class='text'>25&lt;/ref&gt; At age seven, he was given his first lessons outside the family by Michael Holzer, organist and choirmaster of the local parish church in Lichtental; the lessons may have largely consisted of conversations and expressions of admiration</span>

				<span class='text'>2–3&lt;/ref&gt; The boy seemed to gain more from an acquaintance with a friendly [[joiner]]'s apprentice who took him to a neighbouring [[pianoforte]] warehouse where Franz could practice on better instruments</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Wilberforce3&quot;&gt;[[#Wilberforce|Wilberforce (1866)]], p</span>
				<span class='text'>3&lt;/ref&gt; He also played [[viola]] in the family string quartet, with brothers [[Ferdinand Schubert|Ferdinand]] and Ignaz on first and second violin and his father on the [[cello|violoncello]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Franz wrote his earliest string quartets for this ensemble</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;GibbsLife26&quot;&gt;[[#GibbsLife|Gibbs (2000)]], p</span>
				<span class='text'>26&lt;/ref&gt;Young Schubert first came to the attention of [[Antonio Salieri]], then Vienna's leading musical authority, in 1804, when his vocal talent was recognized</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;GibbsLife26&quot;/&gt; In October 1808, he became a pupil at the Stadtkonvikt (Imperial Seminary) through a choir scholarship</span>
				<span class='text'>At the Stadtkonvikt, he was introduced to the overtures and symphonies of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], and the symphonies of [[Joseph Haydn]] and his younger brother [[Michael Haydn|Michael]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Duncan5&quot;&gt;[[#Duncan|Duncan (1905)]], pp</span>
				<span class='text'>5–7&lt;/ref&gt; His exposure to these and lesser works, combined with occasional visits to the opera, laid the foundation for a broader musical education</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Duncan7&quot; /&gt; One important musical influence came from the songs by [[Johann Rudolf Zumsteeg]], an important [[Lied]]er composer of the time</span>
				<span class='text'>The precocious young student &quot;wanted to modernize&quot; them, as reported by [[Joseph von Spaun]], Schubert's friend</span>

				<span class='text'>29&lt;/ref&gt; Schubert's friendship with Spaun began at the Stadtkonvikt and lasted throughout his short life</span>
				<span class='text'>In those early days, the financially well-off Spaun furnished the impoverished Schubert with much of his manuscript paper</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Duncan7&quot;&gt;[[#Duncan|Duncan (1905)]], p</span>
				<span class='text'>7&lt;/ref&gt;In the meantime, his genius began to show in his compositions</span>
				<span class='text'>Schubert was occasionally permitted to lead the Stadtkonvikt's orchestra, and Salieri decided to start training him privately in [[music theory]] and even in composition</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Duncan9&quot;&gt;[[#Duncan|Duncan (1905)]], p</span>
				<span class='text'>9&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first orchestra he wrote for, and he devoted much of the rest of his time at the Stadtkonvikt to composing chamber music, several songs, piano pieces and, more ambitiously, liturgical choral works in the form of a &quot;Salve Regina&quot; (D 27), a &quot;Kyrie&quot; (D 31), in addition to the unfinished &quot;Octet for Winds&quot; (D 72, said to commemorate the 1812 death of his mother),&lt;ref name=&quot;Frost9&quot;&gt;[[#Frost|Frost]], p</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1814, he entered his father's school as teacher of the youngest pupils</span>

				<span class='text'>He continued to take private lessons in composition from Salieri, who gave Schubert more actual technical training than any of his other teachers, before they parted ways in 1817</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Duncan9&quot;/&gt;In 1814, Schubert met a young soprano named [[Therese Grob]], daughter of a local silk manufacturer and wrote several of his liturgical works (including a &quot;Salve Regina&quot; and a &quot;Tantum Ergo&quot;) for her; she also was a soloist in the premiere of his [[Mass No</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;=== Supported by friends ===Significant changes happened in 1816</span>
				<span class='text'>Schober, a student and of good family and some means, invited Schubert to room with him at his mother's house</span>
				<span class='text'>The proposal was particularly opportune, for Schubert had just made the unsuccessful application for the post of [[kapellmeister]] at Laibach, and he had also decided not to resume teaching duties at his father's school</span>
				<span class='text'>By the end of the year, he became a guest in Schober's lodgings</span>
				<span class='text'>For a time, he attempted to increase the household resources by giving music lessons, but they were soon abandoned, and he devoted himself to composition</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Duncan26&quot;&gt;[[#Duncan|Duncan (1905)]], p</span>
				<span class='text'>26&lt;/ref&gt; During this year, he focused on orchestral and choral works, although he also continued to write Lieder (songs)</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|Caricature of Johann Michael Vogl and Franz Schubert by [[Franz von Schober]] (1825)]]In early 1817, Schober introduced Schubert to [[Johann Michael Vogl]], a prominent baritone twenty years Schubert's senior</span>
				<span class='text'>Vogl, for whom Schubert went on to write a great many songs, became one of Schubert's main proponents in Viennese musical circles</span>
				<span class='text'>He also met Joseph Hüttenbrenner (brother to Anselm), who also played a role in promoting Schubert's music</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Newbould66&quot;&gt;[[#Newbould|Newbould (1999)]], p</span>
				<span class='text'>66&lt;/ref&gt; These, and an increasing circle of friends and musicians, became responsible for promoting, collecting, and, after his death, preserving his work</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Duncan90&quot;&gt;[[#Duncan|Duncan (1905)]], pp</span>
				<span class='text'>90–93&lt;/ref&gt;In late 1817, Schubert's father gained a new position at a school in [[Alsergrund#District sections|Rossau]], not far from Lichtental</span>
				<span class='text'>Schubert rejoined his father and reluctantly took up teaching duties there</span>
				<span class='text'>In early 1818, he was rejected for membership in the prestigious [[Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde]], something that might have furthered his musical career</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Newbould69&quot;/&gt; However, he began to gain more notice in the press, and the first public performance of a secular work, an overture performed in February 1818, received praise from the press in Vienna and abroad</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;GibbsLife59&quot;&gt;[[#GibbsLife|Gibbs (2000)]], p</span>
				<span class='text'>59&lt;/ref&gt;Schubert spent the summer of 1818, as a music teacher to the family of Count Johann Karl [[House of Esterházy|Esterházy]] at their château in Zseliz (now [[Želiezovce]], Slovakia)</span>
				<span class='text'>The pay was relatively good, and his duties teaching piano and singing to the two daughters were relatively light, allowing him to compose happily</span>

				<span class='text'>69–72&lt;/ref&gt; The respite at Zseliz led to a succession of compositions for piano duet</span>

				<span class='text'>235&lt;/ref&gt;During the early 1820s, Schubert was part of a close-knit circle of artists and students who had social gatherings together that became known as ''[[Schubertiade]]n''</span>
				<span class='text'>The tight circle of friends with which Schubert surrounded himself was dealt a blow in early 1820</span>
				<span class='text'>Schubert and four of his friends were arrested by the Austrian police, who (in the aftermath of the [[French Revolution]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]]) were on their guard against revolutionary activities and suspicious of any gathering of youth or students</span>
				<span class='text'>One of Schubert's friends, [[Johann Senn]], was put on trial, imprisoned for over a year, and then permanently forbidden to enter Vienna</span>
				<span class='text'>The other four, including Schubert, were &quot;severely reprimanded&quot;, in part for &quot;inveighing against [officials] with insulting and opprobrious language&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;GibbsLife67&quot;&gt;[[#GibbsLife|Gibbs (2000)]], p</span>
				<span class='text'>67&lt;/ref&gt; While Schubert never saw Senn again, he did set some of his poems, &quot;Selige Welt&quot; (D</span>
				<span class='text'>743) and ''Schwanengesang'' (D 744), to music</span>
				<span class='text'>The incident may have played a role in a falling-out with Mayrhofer, with whom he was living at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;GibbsLife68&quot;&gt;[[#GibbsLife|Gibbs (2000)]], p</span>
				<span class='text'>68&lt;/ref&gt;He was nicknamed &quot;Schwammerl&quot; by his friends, which Gibbs describes as translating to &quot;Tubby&quot; or &quot;Little Mushroom&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Schubert, at 1</span>

				<span class='text'>111&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Rosamunde]], Fürstin von Zypern'' (D 797) was withdrawn after two nights, owing to the poor quality of the play for which Schubert had written incidental music</span>
				<span class='text'>Of these works, the two former ones are written on a scale which would make their performances exceedingly difficult (''Fierabras'', for instance, contains over 1,000 pages of manuscript score), but ''Die Verschworenen'' is a bright attractive comedy, and ''Rosamunde'' contains some of the most charming music that Schubert ever composed</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1822, he made the acquaintance with both Weber and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], but little came of it in either case</span>
				<span class='text'>Beethoven is said to have acknowledged the younger man's gifts on a few occasions, but some of this is likely legend and in any case he could not have known the real scope of Schubert's music, especially not the instrumental works, as so little of it was printed or performed in the composer's lifetime</span>

				<span class='text'>' Macmillan, London and New York, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;=== Style ===In July 1947 the 20th-century composer [[Ernst Krenek]] discussed Schubert's style, abashedly admitting that he had at first &quot;shared the wide-spread opinion that Schubert was a lucky inventor of pleasing tunes </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>lacking the dramatic power and searching intelligence which distinguished such 'real' masters as [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Bach]] or [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Krenek wrote that he reached a completely different assessment after close study of Schubert's pieces at the urging of friend and fellow composer [[Eduard Erdmann]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Krenek pointed to the piano sonatas as giving &quot;ample evidence that [Schubert] was much more than an easy-going tune-smith who did not know, and did not care, about the craft of composition</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Each sonata then in print, according to Krenek, exhibited &quot;a great wealth of technical finesse&quot; and revealed Schubert as &quot;far from satisfied with pouring his charming ideas into conventional molds; on the contrary he was a thinking artist with a keen appetite for experimentation</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lev&quot;&gt;[[#Lev|Lev]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;====Instrumental music, stage works and church music===={{see also|Sonatas, duos and fantasies by Franz Schubert|List of solo piano compositions by Franz Schubert|Stage works by Franz Schubert}}That &quot;appetite for experimentation&quot; manifests itself repeatedly in Schubert's output in a wide variety of forms and genres, including opera, [[liturgical music]], chamber and solo piano music, and symphonic works</span>
				<span class='text'>Perhaps most familiarly, his adventurousness manifests itself as a notably original sense of modulation, as in the second movement of the [[String Quintet (Schubert)|String Quintet]] (D</span>
				<span class='text'>956) where he modulates from E major through F minor, to reach the tonic key of E major</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Gammond117&quot;&gt;[[#Gammond|Gammond (1982)]], p</span>
				<span class='text'>117&lt;/ref&gt; It also appears in unusual choices of instrumentation, as in the [[Arpeggione Sonata|Sonata in A minor]] for arpeggione and piano (D</span>
				<span class='text'>821), or the unconventional scoring of the ''[[Trout Quintet]]'' (D</span>
				<span class='text'>667)</span>

				<span class='text'>5 (Schubert)|5th Symphony]], are particularly Mozartean), his formal structures and his developments tend to give the impression more of melodic development than of harmonic drama</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Gammond76&quot;&gt;[[#Gammond|Gammond (1982)]], pp</span>
				<span class='text'>76–81&lt;/ref&gt; This combination of Classical form and long-breathed Romantic melody sometimes lends them a discursive style: his ''Great C major'' Symphony was described by [[Robert Schumann]] as running to &quot;heavenly lengths&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Brown630&quot;&gt;[[#Brown|Brown]], p</span>
				<span class='text'>630&lt;/ref&gt; His harmonic innovations include movements in which the first section ends in the key of the [[subdominant]] rather than the [[Dominant (music)|dominant]] (as in the last movement of the ''Trout Quintet'')</span>
				<span class='text'>Schubert's practice here was a forerunner of the common Romantic technique of relaxing, rather than raising, tension in the middle of a movement, with final resolution postponed to the very end</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}====Lieder and part songs===={{see also|List of songs composed by Franz Schubert|Schubert's song cycles}}It was in the genre of the [[Lied]], however, that Schubert made his most indelible mark</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Plantinga, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>107–117&lt;/ref&gt;Among Schubert's treatments of the poetry of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], his settings of &quot;[[Gretchen am Spinnrade]]&quot; (D</span>
				<span class='text'>118) and &quot;[[Der Erlkönig]]&quot; (D</span>
				<span class='text'>328) are particularly striking for their dramatic content, forward-looking uses of harmony, and their use of eloquent pictorial keyboard figurations, such as the depiction of the spinning wheel and treadle in the piano in &quot;Gretchen&quot; and the furious and ceaseless gallop in &quot;{{Lang|de|Erlkönig}}&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Swafford211&quot;&gt;[[#Swafford|Swafford]], p</span>
				<span class='text'>211&lt;/ref&gt; He composed music using the poems of a myriad of poets, with Goethe, Mayrhofer and [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]] being the top three most frequent, and others like [[Heinrich Heine]], [[Friedrich Rückert]] and [[Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff]] among many others</span>
				<span class='text'>Also of particular note are his two [[song cycle]]s on the poems of [[Wilhelm Müller]], ''[[Die schöne Müllerin]]'' and ''[[Winterreise]]'', which helped to establish the genre and its potential for musical, poetic, and almost operatic dramatic narrative</span>
				<span class='text'>His last song cycle published in 1828 after his death, ''[[Schwanengesang]]'', is also an innovative contribution to German lieder literature, as it features poems by different poets, namely [[Ludwig Rellstab]], Heine, and [[Johann Gabriel Seidl]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''[[Wiener Theaterzeitung]]'', writing about ''Winterreise'' at the time, commented that it was a work that &quot;none can sing or hear without being deeply moved&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>153–156&lt;/ref&gt;[[Antonín Dvořák]] wrote in 1894 that Schubert, whom he considered one of the truly great composers, was clearly influential on shorter works, especially Lieder and shorter piano works: &quot;The tendency of the romantic school has been toward short forms, and although Weber helped to show the way, to Schubert belongs the chief credit of originating the short models of piano forte pieces which the romantic school has preferably cultivated</span>

				<span class='text'>= Recognition ==A feeling of regret for the loss of potential masterpieces caused by his early death at age 31 was expressed in the epitaph on his large tombstone written by his friend the poet [[Franz Grillparzer]]: &quot;Here music has buried a treasure, but even fairer hopes</span>

				<span class='text'>This is in particular the opinion of pianists, including [[Alfred Brendel]], who dryly billed the Grillparzer epitaph as &quot;inappropriate&quot;</span>
