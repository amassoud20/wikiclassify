				<span class='text'>This work followed the experimental discovery of the [[parity (physics)|violation of parity]] by [[Chien-Shiung Wu]], as suggested by [[Chen Ning Yang]] and [[Tsung-Dao Lee]], theoretically</span>
				<span class='text'>ell-Mann's work in the 1950s involved recently discovered [[cosmic ray]] particles that came to be called [[kaon]]s and [[hyperon]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>Classifying these particles led him to propose that a [[quantum number]] called [[strangeness]] would be conserved by the strong and the electromagnetic interactions, but not by the weak interactions</span>
				<span class='text'>Another of Gell-Mann's ideas is the [[Gell-Mann–Okubo mass formula|Gell-Mann-Okubo]] formula, which was, initially, a formula based on empirical results, but was later explained by his quark model</span>
				<span class='text'>Gell-Mann and [[Abraham Pais]] were involved in explaining several puzzling aspects of the physics of these particles</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1961, this led him (and [[Kazuhiko Nishijima]]) to introduce a classification scheme for [[hadron]]s, elementary particles that participate in the strong interaction</span>
				<span class='text'>(This scheme had been independently proposed by [[Yuval Ne'eman]]</span>
				<span class='text'> This scheme is now explained by the [[quark model]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Gell-Mann referred to the scheme as the ''[[Eightfold Way (physics)|Eightfold Way]]'', because of the ''octets'' of particles in the classification</span>
				<span class='text'>(The term is a reference to the [[Noble Eightfold Path|eightfold way]] of [[Buddhism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1964, Gell-Mann and, independently, [[George Zweig]] went on to postulate the existence of [[quark]]s, particles of which the [[hadron]]s of this scheme are composed</span>
				<span class='text'>The name was coined by Gell-Mann and is a reference to the novel ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'', by [[James Joyce]] (&quot;Three quarks for Muster Mark!&quot;  book 2, episode 4</span>

				<span class='text'>Quarks, antiquarks, and gluons were soon established as the underlying elementary objects in the study of the structure of hadrons</span>

				<span class='text'>The [[quark model]] is a part of QCD, and it has been robust enough naturally to accommodate the discovery of new &quot;[[flavor (particle physics)|flavors]]&quot; of quarks, which superseded the eightfold way scheme</span>
				<span class='text'>uring the 1990s, Gell-Mann's interest turned to the emerging study of [[complexity]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He played a central role in the founding of the [[Santa Fe Institute]], where he continues to work as a distinguished professor</span>
