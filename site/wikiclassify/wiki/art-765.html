				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=newkind/&gt; Against the gender stereotypes of the time, the natural thickness of her brown eyebrows made her &quot;funny face unforgettable&quot;, reminisced director Billy Wilder</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Audrey Hepburn 1993&quot;/&gt;Hepburn redefined glamour with &quot;elfin&quot; features and a [[gamine]] [[waif]]-like figure that inspired designs by couturier [[Hubert de Givenchy]] who is credited for creating her style</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=weilerelfin/&gt; Givenchy started designing her dresses since the film ''Sabrina'' (1954)</span>
				<span class='text'>He noted that, upon being told that he would be responsible for designing many outfits for &quot;Miss Hepburn&quot;, he had expected [[Katharine Hepburn]]</span>
				<span class='text'>When faced with Audrey, he was initially disappointed and told Hepburn he had little time to spare</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, she knew exactly how she wanted to look and asked to view his latest collection</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;zekas1&quot;/&gt; Their collaboration in ''Sabrina'' formed a lifelong friendship and partnership; she was often a muse for many of his designs and her style became renowned internationally</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;[Givenchy] gave me a look, a kind, a silhouette</span>
				<span class='text'>He has always been the best and he stayed the best</span>
				<span class='text'>Because he kept the spare style that I love</span>
				<span class='text'>What is more beautiful than a simple sheath made an extraordinary way in a special fabric, and just two earrings?&quot; revealed Hepburn</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Audrey Hepburn 1993&quot;/&gt; Givenchy created her outfits for many other films, including ''Funny Face'', ''Love in the Afternoon'', ''Breakfast at Tiffany's'', ''Paris When It Sizzles'', ''Charade'' and ''How to Steal a Million'' (in which at one point her character is disguised as a cleaning woman and the male lead, played by [[Peter O'Toole]], remarks that this &quot;gives Givenchy a night off&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>The designer was always amazed that, even after thirty five years of collaboration, &quot;her measurements [had] not changed an inch&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Audrey Hepburn 1993&quot;&gt;Regard sur Audrey Hepburn, Regard Magazine n° 4, Paris, January 1993</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Givenchy remained Hepburn's friend and ambassador, and she his muse, throughout her life</span>
				<span class='text'>Hepburn observed, &quot;I have many things in common with Hubert</span>
				<span class='text'>We like the same things</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Audrey Hepburn 1993&quot;/&gt; She agreed to model, on occasions, the creations of her friend</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1988, when he presented his summer collection in Paris, she said, &quot;Wherever I am in the world, he is always there</span>
				<span class='text'>He is a man who does not disperse into worldliness</span>
				<span class='text'>He has time for those he loves</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Audrey Hepburn 1993&quot;/&gt; Givenchy subsequently created a perfume for her titled [[L'Interdit]] (French for &quot;Forbidden&quot;)</span>
