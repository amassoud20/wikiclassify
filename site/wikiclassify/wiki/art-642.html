				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; [[Count]] of [[Quaregna]] and [[Cerreto Castello|Cerreto]] (9 August 1776, [[Turin]], [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmont-Sardinia]] – 9 July 1856), was an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[scientist]]</span>
				<span class='text'> He is most noted for his contribution to [[molecular theory]] now known as [[Avogadro's law]], which says equal volumes of gases under the same conditions of temperature and pressure will contain equal numbers of molecules</span>
				<span class='text'>In tribute to him, the number of elementary entities ([[atom]]s, [[molecule]]s, [[ion]]s or other particles) in 1 [[mole (unit)|mole]] of a substance, {{val|6</span>
				<span class='text'>2214179|(30)|e=23}}, is known as the [[Avogadro constant]], one of the seven [[SI]] base units and represented by ''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'>=Biography==Avogadro was born at [[Turin]] to a noble family of [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmont-Sardinia]] in the year 1776</span>
				<span class='text'>That city, now part of [[Italy]], was then of the Kingdom of Sardinia</span>
				<span class='text'>ince childhood, Avogadro had a deep interest in science</span>
				<span class='text'>Growing up, he was inspired by the works of [[Galileo]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and was sent to school by his father to become a lawyer</span>
				<span class='text'>e graduated in [[ecclesiastical law]] at the early age of 31 and began to practice</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon after, he dedicated himself to [[physics]] and [[mathematics]] (then called ''positive philosophy''), and in 1809 started teaching them at a ''liceo'' (high school) in [[Vercelli]], where his family lived and had some property</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1811, he published an article with the title ''Essai d'une manière de déterminer les masses relatives des molécules élémentaires des corps, et les proportions selon lesquelles elles entrent dans ces combinaisons'' (&quot;Essay on Determining the Relative Masses of the Elementary Molecules of Bodies and the Proportions by Which They Enter These Combinations&quot;), which contains Avogadro's hypothesis</span>
				<span class='text'>Avogadro submitted this essay to a [[Jean-Claude Delamétherie]]'s ''Journal de Physique, de Chimie et d'Histoire naturelle'' (&quot;Journal of Physics, Chemistry and Natural History&quot;, Piedmont at the time forming part of the [[First French Empire]])</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1820, he became professor of physics at the University of Turin</span>
				<span class='text'>Turin was now the capital of  the restored Savoyard [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] under [[Victor Emmanuel I of Sardinia|Victor Emmanuel I]]</span>
				<span class='text'>vogadro was active in the [[Piedmont insurrection|revolutionary movement]]  of March 1821</span>
				<span class='text'>s a result, he lost his chair in 1823 (or, as the university officially declared, it was &quot;very glad to allow this interesting scientist to take a rest from heavy teaching duties, in order to be able to give better attention to his researches&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>ventually, King [[Charles Albert of Savoy|Charles Albert]] granted a Constitution (''[[Statuto Albertino]]'') in 1848</span>
				<span class='text'>Well before this, Avogadro had been recalled to the university in Turin in 1833, where he taught for another twenty years</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;piedmont&quot;&gt;[http://www</span>
				<span class='text'>nipmn</span>

				<span class='text'>spx?open=|807|&amp;oid=1389  University of Piedmont (unipmn</span>
				<span class='text'>t)] ''Con sospetto entusiasmo, prese parte ai movimenti politici rivoluzionari del 1821 (contro il re di Sardegna), cosicché due anni dopo venne rimosso dalla sua posizione (o, come venne dichiarato ufficialmente, l'università era «lieta di permettere a questo interessante scienziato, di prendere una pausa di riposo dai pesanti doveri dell'insegnamento, in modo da essere in grado di dare una migliore attenzione alle sue ricerche»)</span>
				<span class='text'>Comunque, con il tempo il suo isolamento politico venne gradualmente ridotto, in quanto le idee rivoluzionarie ricevevano una crescente attenzione da parte di casa Savoia, fino a quando nel 1848 Carlo Alberto emise una costituzione moderna (lo Statuto Albertino)</span>
				<span class='text'>Ben prima di ciò (1833), a seguito della crescente attenzione per i suoi lavori, Avogadro venne richiamato all'Università di Torino, dove insegnò per altri venti anni</span>
				<span class='text'>''&lt;/ref&gt;Little is known about Avogadro's private life, which appears to have been sober and religious</span>
				<span class='text'>He married Felicita Mazzé and had six children</span>
				<span class='text'>vogadro held posts dealing with statistics, meteorology, and weights and measures (he introduced the [[metric system]] into Piedmont) and was a member of the Royal Superior Council on Public Instruction</span>
				<span class='text'>e died on 9 July 1856</span>
				<span class='text'>=Accomplishments==In honor of Avogadro's contributions to molecular theory, the number of molecules in one mole was named ''[[Avogadro's number]]'', N&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; or &quot;Avogadro's constant&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>It is approximately {{val|6</span>
				<span class='text'>221415|e=23}}</span>
				<span class='text'> Avogadro's number is used to compute the results of chemical reactions</span>
				<span class='text'>It allows chemists to determine amounts of substances produced in a given reaction to a great degree of accuracy</span>
				<span class='text'>[Johann Josef Loschmidt]] first calculated the value of Avogadro's number, often referred to as the Loschmidt number in German-speaking countries ([[Loschmidt constant]] now has another meaning)</span>
				<span class='text'>[Avogadro's Law]] states that the relationship between the masses of the same volume of same gases (at the same temperature and pressure) corresponds to the relationship between their respective molecular weights</span>
				<span class='text'>Hence, the relative molecular mass of a gas can be calculated from the mass of sample of known volume</span>
				<span class='text'>vogadro developed this hypothesis after [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] had published in 1808 his law on volumes (and combining gases)</span>
				<span class='text'>The greatest problem Avogadro had to resolve was the confusion at that time regarding atoms and molecules</span>
				<span class='text'>One of his most important contributions was clearly distinguishing one from the other, stating that gases are composed of molecules, and these molecules are composed of atoms</span>
				<span class='text'>For instance, [[John Dalton]] did not consider this possibility</span>
				<span class='text'>Avogadro did not actually use the word &quot;atom&quot; as the words &quot;atom&quot; and &quot;molecule&quot; were used almost without difference</span>
				<span class='text'>He believed that there were three kinds of &quot;molecules,&quot; including an &quot;elementary molecule&quot; (our &quot;atom&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>Also, more attention was given to the definition of [[mass]], as distinguished from [[weight]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Avogadro - Mémoire sur les chaleurs spécifiques des corps solides et liquides, 1833 - 6060053 TOAS005003 00003</span>
				<span class='text'>if|thumb|''Mémoire'']]In 1815, he published ''Mémoire sur les masses relatives des molécules des corps simples, ou densités présumées de leur gaz, et sur la constitution de quelques-uns de leur composés, pour servir de suite à l'Essai sur le même sujet, publié dans le Journal de Physique, juillet 1811'' (&quot;Note on the Relative Masses of Elementary Molecules, or Suggested Densities of Their Gases, and on the Constituents of Some of Their Compounds, As a Follow-up to the Essay on the Same Subject, Published in the Journal of Physics, July 1811&quot;) ([http://www</span>
				<span class='text'>ccademiaxl</span>
				<span class='text'>t/Library/Percorsi/images/Image54</span>
				<span class='text'>pg]), about gas densities</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1821 he published another paper, ''Nouvelles considérations sur la théorie des proportions déterminées dans les combinaisons, et sur la détermination des masses des molécules des corps'' (''New Considerations on the Theory of Proportions Determined in Combinations, and on Determination of the Masses of Atoms'') and shortly afterwards, ''Mémoire sur la manière de ramener les composès organiques aux lois ordinaires des proportions déterminées'' (''Note on the Manner of Finding the Organic Composition by the Ordinary Laws of Determined Proportions'')</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1841, he published his work in ''Fisica dei corpi ponderabili, ossia Trattato della costituzione materiale de' corpi'', 4 volumes</span>
				<span class='text'>=Response to the theory==The scientific community did not give great attention to his theory, so Avogadro's hypothesis was not immediately accepted</span>
				<span class='text'>[[André-Marie Ampère]] achieved the same results three years later by another method (in his ''{{lang|fr|Sur la détermination des proportions dans lesquelles les corps se combinent d'après le nombre et la disposition respective des molécules dont leurs particules intégrantes sont composées}}'' -- ''On the Determination of Proportions in which Bodies Combine According to the Number and the Respective Disposition of the Molecules by Which Their Integral Particles Are Made''), but the same indifference was shown to his theory as well</span>
				<span class='text'>nly through studies by [[Charles Frédéric Gerhardt]] and [[Auguste Laurent]] on [[organic chemistry]] was it possible to demonstrate that Avogadro's law explained why the same quantities of molecules in a gas have the same volume</span>
				<span class='text'>nfortunately, related experiments with some inorganic substances showed seeming exceptions to the law</span>
				<span class='text'>This was finally resolved by [[Stanislao Cannizzaro]], as announced at [[Karlsruhe Congress]] in 1860, four years after Avogadro's death</span>
				<span class='text'>He explained that these exceptions were due to  molecular dissociations at certain temperatures, and that Avogadro's law determined not only molecular masses, but atomic masses as well</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1911, a meeting in Turin commemorated the hundredth anniversary of the publication of Avogadro's classic 1811 paper</span>
				<span class='text'>King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel III]] attended</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, Avogadro's great contribution to chemistry was recognized</span>
				<span class='text'>[Rudolf Clausius]], with his kinetic theory on gases, gave another confirmation of Avogadro's Law</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff]] showed that Avogadro's theory also held in dilute solutions</span>
				<span class='text'>vogadro is hailed as a founder of the [[Atomic theory#Modern atomic theory|atomic-molecular theory]]</span>
