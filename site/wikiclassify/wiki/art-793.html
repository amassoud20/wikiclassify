				<span class='text'>n 364 BC, Philip returned to Macedon</span>
				<span class='text'>The deaths of Philip's elder brothers, [[Alexander II of Macedon|King Alexander II]] and [[Perdiccas III of Macedon|Perdiccas III]], allowed him to take the throne in 359 BC</span>
				<span class='text'>Originally appointed [[regent]] for his infant nephew [[Amyntas IV of Macedon|Amyntas IV]], who was the son of Perdiccas III, Philip managed to take the kingdom for himself that same year</span>
				<span class='text'>hilip's military skills and expansionist vision of Macedonian greatness brought him early success</span>
				<span class='text'>He first had to re-establish a situation which had been greatly worsened by the defeat against the [[Illyrians]] in which King Perdiccas himself had died</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Paionia]]ns and the [[Thracians]] had sacked and invaded the eastern regions of the country, while the [[Athens|Athenians]] had landed, at [[Methoni, Pieria|Methoni]] on the coast, a contingent under a Macedonian pretender called [[Argeus (pretender)|Argeus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>sing diplomacy, Philip pushed back the Paionians and Thracians promising tributes, and crushed the 3,000 Athenian [[hoplite]]s (359)</span>
				<span class='text'>Momentarily free from his opponents, he concentrated on strengthening his internal position and, above all, his army</span>
				<span class='text'>His most important innovation was doubtless the introduction of the [[Phalanx formation|phalanx]] infantry corps, armed with the famous [[sarissa]], an exceedingly long spear, at the time the most important army corps in Macedonia</span>
				<span class='text'>hilip had married [[Audata]], great-granddaughter of the Illyrian king of [[Dardania (Europe)|Dardania]], [[Bardyllis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>However, this did not prevent him from marching against them in 358 and crushing them in a ferocious battle in which some 7,000 Illyrians died (357)</span>
				<span class='text'>By this move, Philip established his authority inland as far as [[Lake Ohrid]] and earned the favour of the [[Epirotes]]</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;The victory over Bardylis made him an attractive ally to the Epirotes, who too had suffered at the Illyrians' hands, and his recent alignment </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt;He agreed with the Athenians, who had been so far unable to conquer [[Amphipolis]], which commanded the [[Gold mining|gold mines]] of [[Mount Pangaion]], to lease it to them after its conquest, in exchange for [[Pydna]] (lost by Macedon in 363)</span>
				<span class='text'>However, after conquering Amphipolis, he kept both the cities (357)</span>
				<span class='text'>As Athens declared war against him, he allied with the [[Chalkidian League]] of [[Olynthus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He subsequently conquered [[Potidaea]], this time keeping his word and ceding it to the League in 356</span>
				<span class='text'>One year before, Philip had married the [[Epirus|Epirote]] princess [[Olympias]], who was the daughter of the king of the [[Molossians]]</span>
				<span class='text'>uring 356 BC, Philip also conquered the town of [[Krinides|Crenides]] and changed its name to [[Philippi]]: he established a powerful garrison there to control its mines, which granted him much of the gold later used for his campaigns</span>
				<span class='text'>In the meantime, his general [[Parmenion]] defeated the Illyrians again</span>
				<span class='text'>Also in 356 [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] was born, and Philip's race horse won in the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 355&amp;ndash;354 he besieged [[Methoni, Pieria|Methone]], the last city on the [[Thermaic Gulf]] controlled by Athens</span>
				<span class='text'>During the siege, Philip was injured in his eye</span>
				<span class='text'>It was later removed surgically</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;A special instrument known as the [[Spoon of Dioclese]] was used to remove his eye</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Despite the arrival of two Athenian fleets, the city fell in 354</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip also attacked [[Abdera, Thrace|Abdera]] and Maronea, on the [[Thrace|Thracian]] seaboard (354&amp;ndash;353)</span>
				<span class='text'>[Image:Map Macedonia 336 BC-en</span>
				<span class='text'>vg|thumb|450px|Map of the territory of Philip II of Macedon</span>
				<span class='text'>]Philip was involved in the [[Third Sacred War]] which had begun in Greece in 356</span>
				<span class='text'>During the summer of 353 he invaded [[Thessaly]], defeating 7,000 [[Phocis|Phocians]] under the brother of [[Onomarchus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The latter however defeated Philip in the two succeeding battles</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip returned to Thessaly the next summer, this time with an army of 20,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry including all Thessalian troops</span>
				<span class='text'>In the [[Battle of Crocus Field]] 6,000 Phocians fell, while 3,000 were taken as prisoners and later drowned</span>
				<span class='text'>his battle granted Philip an immense prestige, as well as the free acquisition of [[Pherae]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip was also ''tagus'' of Thessaly, and he claimed as his own [[Magnesia (regional unit)|Magnesia]], with the important harbour of [[Pagasae]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip did not attempt to advance into [[Central Greece]] because the Athenians, unable to arrive in time to defend Pagasae, had occupied [[Thermopylae]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ostilities with Athens did not yet take place, but Athens was threatened by the Macedonian party which Philip's gold created in [[Euboea]]</span>
				<span class='text'>From 352 to 346 BC, Philip did not again come south</span>
				<span class='text'>He was active in completing the subjugation of the [[Balkans|Balkan]] hill-country to the west and north, and in reducing the Greek cities of the coast as far as the [[Maritsa|Hebrus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>To the chief of these coastal cities, [[Olynthus]], Philip continued to profess friendship until its neighboring cities were in his hands</span>
				<span class='text'>[Image:PhilipIIGoldStaterHeadOfApollo</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|250px|Philip II gold [[stater]], with head of [[Apollo]]</span>
				<span class='text'>]In 349 BC, Philip started the siege of Olynthus, which, apart from its strategic position, housed his relatives [[Arrhidaeus (son of Amyntas III)|Arrhidaeus]] and [[Menelaus (son of Amyntas III)|Menelaus]], pretenders to the Macedonian throne</span>
				<span class='text'>Olynthus had at first allied itself with Philip, but later shifted its allegiance to Athens</span>
				<span class='text'>The latter, however, did nothing to help the city, its expeditions held back by a revolt in Euboea (probably paid by Philip's gold)</span>
				<span class='text'>The Macedonian king finally took Olynthus in 348 BC and razed the city to the ground</span>
				<span class='text'>The same fate was inflicted on other cities of the Chalcidian peninsula</span>
				<span class='text'>acedon and the regions adjoining it having now been securely consolidated, Philip celebrated his [[Olympic Games]] at [[Dion, Greece|Dium]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 347 BC, Philip advanced to the conquest of the eastern districts about Hebrus, and compelled the submission of the [[Odrysian kingdom|Thracian]] prince [[Cersobleptes]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 346 BC, he intervened effectively in the war between Thebes and the Phocians, but his wars with Athens continued intermittently</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Athens had made overtures for peace, and when Philip again moved south, peace was sworn in Thessaly</span>
				<span class='text'>ith key Greek city-states in submission, Philip II turned to [[Sparta]]; he sent them a message: &quot;If I win this war, you will be slaves forever</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; In another version, he warned: &quot;You are advised to submit without further delay, for if I bring my army into your land, I will destroy your farms, slay your people, and raze your city</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; According to both accounts, the Spartans' [[laconic]] reply was one word: &quot;If&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip II and Alexander both chose to leave Sparta alone</span>
				<span class='text'>Later, the Macedonian arms were carried across Epirus to the [[Adriatic Sea]]</span>

				<span class='text'>14, ISBN 0-7864-1918-0&lt;/ref&gt;In 342 BC, Philip led a great military expedition north against the [[Scythians]], conquering the Thracian fortified settlement Eumolpia to give it his name, ''Philippopolis'' (modern [[Plovdiv]])</span>
				<span class='text'>n 340 BC, Philip started the siege of [[Marmara Ereğli|Perinthus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip began another siege in 339 of the city of [[Byzantium]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After unsuccessful sieges of both cities, Philip's influence all over Greece was compromised</span>
				<span class='text'>However, he successfully reasserted his authority in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] by defeating an alliance of Thebans and Athenians at the [[Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)|Battle of Chaeronea]] in 338 BC, while in the same year, Philip destroyed [[Amfissa]] because the residents had illegally cultivated part of the Crisaian plain which belonged to [[Delphi]]</span>
				<span class='text'>t was these decisive victories that finally secured Philip’s position as having the majority of Greece under Macedonian sovereignty</span>
				<span class='text'>hilip created and led the [[League of Corinth]] in 337 BC</span>
				<span class='text'>Members of the League agreed never to wage war against each other, unless it was to suppress [[revolution]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Philip was elected as leader (''[[Hegemony|hegemon]]'') of the army of invasion against the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 336 BC, when the invasion of Persia was in its very early stage, Philip was assassinated, and was succeeded on the throne of Macedon by his son Alexander III, who later become known as [[Alexander the Great]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==State system and Achaemenid Persian borrowings and influences===As historians Roisman and Worthington state, to Macedonian rulers, [[Achaemenid Persia]] stood as an example of statehood and ''[[mores]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2011|p=345}} This is especially true of Philip II as he built his power and created many institutions to imitate those known from the Achaemenid Empire</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2011|p=345}} Thus, inspired by Persian achievements, Philip established a Royal Secretary and Archive, and aimed at the elevation of the political as well as religious level, and he used a special throne ([[Greek language|Gr</span>
				<span class='text'>] ''thronos'') borrowed from the Achaemenid court to demonstrate his elevated rank</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2011|p=345}} The institution of the Royal Pages (Gr</span>
				<span class='text'>''Paides Basilikoi'') was probably inspired by Achaemenid prototype - among their duties, [[Arrian]] mentions mounting the king on his horse &quot;in the Persian style&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2011|p=345}} The status of [[Thrace]] in 342-334 under the Macedonian sway as a kind of regular [[satrapy]] resembled Achaemenid administrative practices, and the organization of the royal court, generally, followed in a fashion of the Achaemenid tradition</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2011|p=346}} Some scholars deny Philip's international borrowings from Persian tradition, but it must be said that states do not develop in a vacuum</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2011|p=346}} For an increasingly powerful Macedonia, the most immediate model of a great monarchy was Persia</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2011|p=346}}==Assassination (336 BC)==The murder of Philip occurred during October 336 BC, at [[Vergina|Aegae]], the ancient capital of the kingdom of Macedon</span>
				<span class='text'>The court had gathered there for the celebration of the marriage between [[Alexander I of Epirus]] and Philip's daughter, by his fourth wife [[Olympias]], [[Cleopatra of Macedon|Cleopatra]]</span>
				<span class='text'>While the king was entering unprotected into the town's theater (highlighting his approachability to the Greek diplomats present), he was killed by [[Pausanias of Orestis]], one of his seven bodyguards</span>
				<span class='text'>The assassin immediately tried to escape and reach his associates who were waiting for him with horses at the entrance of Aegae</span>
				<span class='text'>He was pursued by three of Philip's bodyguards; tripping on a vine, he died by their hands</span>
				<span class='text'>he reasons for Pausanias' assassination of Philip are difficult to expound fully, since there was already controversy among ancient historians</span>
				<span class='text'>The only contemporary account in our possession is that of [[Aristotle]] who states rather tersely that Philip was killed because Pausanias had been offended by the followers of [[Attalus (general)|Attalus]], uncle of Philip's wife Cleopatra (renamed upon marriage Eurydice)</span>
				<span class='text'>ifty years later, the historian [[Cleitarchus]] expanded and embellished the story</span>
				<span class='text'>Centuries later, this version was to be narrated by [[Diodorus Siculus]] and all the historians who used Cleitarchus</span>
				<span class='text'>According to the sixteenth book of Diodorus' history,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www</span>
				<span class='text'>oloka</span>
				<span class='text'>om/diodorus%20on%20philip</span>
				<span class='text'>tm Diodorus Siculus, ''The Library of History'', 16</span>
				<span class='text'>1-95]&lt;/ref&gt; Pausanias had been a lover of Philip, but became jealous when Philip turned his attention to a younger man, also called Pausanias</span>
				<span class='text'>The elder Pausanias's taunting of the new lover caused the youth to throw away his life, which turned his friend Attalus against the elder Pausanias</span>
				<span class='text'>Attalus took his revenge by inviting Pausanias to dinner, getting him drunk, then subjecting him to sexual assault</span>
				<span class='text'>hen Pausanias complained to Philip, the king felt unable to chastise Attalus, as he was about to send him to Asia with [[Parmenion]], to establish a bridgehead for his planned invasion</span>
				<span class='text'>He also married Attalus's niece, or daughter, [[Cleopatra Eurydice of Macedon|Eurydice]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Rather than offend Attalus, Philip tried to mollify Pausanias by elevating him within the bodyguard</span>
				<span class='text'>Pausanias' desire for revenge seems to have turned towards the man who had failed to avenge his damaged honour, so he planned to kill Philip</span>
				<span class='text'>Some time after the alleged rape, while Attalus was already in Asia fighting the Persians, he put his plan in action</span>
				<span class='text'>ther historians (e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> [[Justin (historian)|Justin]] 9</span>
				<span class='text'>) suggested that Alexander and/or his mother [[Olympias]] were at least privy to the intrigue, if not themselves instigators</span>
				<span class='text'>The latter seems to have been anything but discreet in manifesting her gratitude to Pausanias, according to Justin's report: he says that the same night of her return from exile she placed a crown on the assassin's corpse and erected a [[tumulus]] to his memory, ordering annual sacrifices to the memory of Pausanias</span>
				<span class='text'>any modern historians have observed that all the accounts are improbable</span>
				<span class='text'>In the case of Pausanias, the stated motive of the crime hardly seems adequate</span>
				<span class='text'>On the other hand, the implication of Alexander and Olympias seems specious: to act as they did would have required brazen effrontery in the face of a military personally loyal to Philip</span>
				<span class='text'>What seems to be recorded in this are the natural suspicions that fell on the chief beneficiaries of the murder; their actions after the murder, however sympathetic they might seem (if actual), cannot prove their guilt in the deed itself</span>
				<span class='text'>hatever the actual background to the assassination, it might have had an enormous effect on later world history, far beyond what any conspirators could have predicted; as asserted by some modern historians, had the older and more settled Philip been the one in charge of the war against Persia, he might have rested content with relatively moderate conquests, e</span>

				<span class='text'>Though the Macedonians did not consider Philip a god, he did receive other forms of recognition by the Greeks, such as at [[Eresos]] (altar to Zeus Philippeios), [[Ephesos]] (his statue was placed in the [[temple of Artemis]]), and Olympia, where the [[Philippeion]] was built</span>
