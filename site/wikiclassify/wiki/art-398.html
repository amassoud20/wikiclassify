				<span class='text'>Bohr was also a [[philosopher]] and a promoter of scientific research</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;frs&quot; /&gt;Bohr developed the [[Bohr model]] of the [[atom]], in which he proposed that energy levels of [[electron]]s are discrete and that the electrons revolve in stable orbits around the [[atomic nucleus]] but can jump from one energy level (or orbit) to another</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the Bohr model has been supplanted by other models, its underlying principles remain valid</span>
				<span class='text'>He conceived the principle of [[Complementarity (physics)|complementarity]]: that items could be separately analysed in terms of contradictory properties, like behaving as a [[Wave–particle duality|wave or a stream of particles]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The notion of complementarity dominated Bohr's thinking in both science and philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>ohr founded the Institute of Theoretical Physics at the [[University of Copenhagen]], now known as the [[Niels Bohr Institute]], which opened in 1920</span>
				<span class='text'>Bohr mentored and collaborated with physicists including [[Hans Kramers]], [[Oskar Klein]], [[George de Hevesy]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He predicted the existence of a new [[zirconium]]-like element, which was named [[hafnium]], after the Latin name for Copenhagen, where it was discovered</span>
				<span class='text'>Later, the element [[bohrium]] was named after him</span>
				<span class='text'>uring the 1930s, Bohr helped refugees from [[Nazism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After [[Invasion of Denmark|Denmark was occupied by the Germans]], he had a famous meeting with Heisenberg, who had become the head of the [[German nuclear energy project]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In September 1943, word reached Bohr that he was about to be arrested by the Germans, and he fled to Sweden</span>
				<span class='text'>From there, he was flown to Britain, where he joined the British [[Tube Alloys]] nuclear weapons project, and was part of the British mission to the [[Manhattan Project]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After the war, Bohr called for international cooperation on nuclear energy</span>
				<span class='text'>He was involved with the establishment of [[CERN]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Niels Bohr centenary|journal=CERN Courier|date=December 1985|volume=25|issue=10|pages=430–432|url=https://cds</span>

				<span class='text'>This involved measuring the frequency of oscillation of the radius of a water jet</span>
				<span class='text'>Bohr conducted a series of experiments using his father's laboratory in the university; the university itself had no physics laboratory</span>
				<span class='text'>To complete his experiments, he had to [[glass blowing|make his own glassware]], creating test tubes with the required [[ellipse|elliptical]] cross-sections</span>
				<span class='text'>He went beyond the original task, incorporating improvements into both Rayleigh's theory and his method, by taking into account the [[viscosity]] of the water, and by working with finite amplitudes instead of just infinitesimal ones</span>
				<span class='text'>His essay, which he submitted at the last minute, won the prize</span>

				<span class='text'>The thesis was accepted in April 1911, and Bohr conducted his formal defence on 13 May</span>
				<span class='text'>Harald had received his doctorate the previous year</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Heilbron|1985|p=43}} Balmer's formula was corroborated by the discovery of additional spectral lines, but for thirty years, no one could explain why it worked</span>
				<span class='text'>In the first paper of his trilogy, Bohr was able to derive it from his model::&lt;math&gt; R_Z = { 2\pi^2 m_e Z^2 e^4 \over h^3 } &lt;/math&gt;where ''m''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the electron's mass, ''e'' is its charge, ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]] and ''Z'' is the atom's [[atomic number]] (1 for hydrogen)</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=146–149}}The model's first hurdle was the [[Pickering series]], lines which did not fit Balmer's formula</span>

				<span class='text'>The Bohr model was found to work for such ions</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=146–149}} Many older physicists, like Thomson, Rayleigh and [[Hendrik Lorentz]], did not like the trilogy, but the younger generation, including Rutherford, [[David Hilbert]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Enrico Fermi]], [[Max Born]] and [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] saw it as a breakthrough</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=152–155}}{{sfn|Kragh|2012|pp=109–111}} The trilogy's acceptance was entirely due to its ability to explain phenomena which stymied other models, and to predict results that were subsequently verified by experiments</span>

				<span class='text'>Early arrivals included [[Hans Kramers]] from the Netherlands, [[Oskar Klein]] from Sweden, George de Hevesy from Hungary, [[Wojciech Rubinowicz]] from Poland and [[Svein Rosseland]] from Norway</span>

				<span class='text'>By 1919, Bohr was moving away from the idea that electrons orbited the nucleus, and he developed [[heuristic]]s to describe them</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[rare earth element]]s posed a particular classification problem for chemists, because they were so chemically similar</span>
				<span class='text'>An important development came in 1924 with [[Wolfgang Pauli]]'s discovery of the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], which put Bohr's models on a firm theoretical footing</span>
				<span class='text'>Bohr was then able to declare that the as-yet-undiscovered element 72 was not a rare earth element, but an element with chemical properties similar to those of [[zirconium]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was immediately challenged by the French chemist [[Georges Urbain]], who claimed to have discovered a rare earth element 72, which he called &quot;celtium&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>At the Institute in  Copenhagen, [[Dirk Coster]] and George de Hevesy took up the challenge of proving Bohr right and Urbain wrong</span>
				<span class='text'>Starting with a clear idea of the chemical properties of the unknown element greatly simplified the search process</span>
				<span class='text'>They went through samples from  Copenhagen's Museum of Mineralogy looking for a zirconium-like element, and soon found it</span>
				<span class='text'>The element, which they named [[hafnium]], ''Hafnia'' being the Latin name for Copenhagen, turned out to be more common than gold</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Kragh|1985|pp=61–64}}{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=202–210}}In 1922, Bohr was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] &quot;for his services in the investigation of the structure of atoms and of the radiation emanating from them&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Pais|1991|p=215}} The award thus recognised both the Trilogy and his early leading work in the emerging field of quantum mechanics</span>
				<span class='text'>For his Nobel lecture, Bohr gave his audience a comprehensive survey of what was then known about the structure of the atom, including the [[correspondence principle]], which he had formulated</span>
				<span class='text'>This states that the behaviour of systems described by quantum theory reproduces [[classical physics]] in the limit of large [[quantum number]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bohr|1985|pp=91–97}}The discovery of [[Compton scattering]] by [[Arthur Holly Compton]] in 1923 convinced most physicists that light was composed of [[photon]]s, and that energy and momentum were conserved in collisions between electrons and photons</span>

				<span class='text'>Slater]], an American physicist working at the Institute in Copenhagen, proposed the [[Bohr–Kramers–Slater theory]] (BKS)</span>
				<span class='text'>It was more a programme than a full physical theory, as the ideas it developed were not worked out quantitatively</span>
				<span class='text'>BKS theory became the final attempt at understanding the interaction of matter and electromagnetic radiation on the basis of the old quantum theory, in which quantum phenomena were treated by imposing quantum restrictions on a classical wave description of the electromagnetic field</span>

				<span class='text'>This prompted Bohr to create a new theory of the [[compound nucleus]] in 1936, which explained how neutrons could be captured by the nucleus</span>
				<span class='text'>In this model, the nucleus could be deformed like a drop of liquid</span>
				<span class='text'>He worked on this with a new collaborator, the Danish physicist Fritz Kalckar, who died suddenly in 1938</span>
